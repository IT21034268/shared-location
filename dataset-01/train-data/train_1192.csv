3,Not as good as the original,"I remember the first time I heard ""Echoing Green"" on KCMU (now KEXP) in Seattle in 1991. It followed a New Order tune and I remember liking it very much. I bought the eponymous cassette tape and wore it out. The album found here is not, unfortunately, true to the feel of the original independent release. This version features remixes with poorly dubbed drum tracks and missing vocal tracks. Shame on Zoo."
4,a nice bunch of synthy pop songs,This is a synth-pop album in the style of Depeche Mode or Camouflage. A number of these songs were mild club hits around 90 or 91. Others are just nice melodic synth-pop. Most of them are very catchy. This music is for the poppy set of shoe-gazers and those that dress in black.
4,Still Waiting - Amazon Cancelled my order!!!,"I ordered this CD on November 4th 2005, it is now February 4th 2006, three months later and still no CD. Amazon has been pushing back the delivery date on this item for months and no delivery is in sight. I am buying this as a gift for my GF, who really really wants and adores this CD. If you can find it elsewhere buy it there, my advice is not to buy from Amazon.UPDATE 2006, March 1stWell, NO CD!!! Amazon cancelled my order!! I received notice that it would be another month before the order was fufulled, and needed to ""OK"" the delay - I was given until Mid march to consent - then received an email from amazon indicating my order was cancelled -BOO.Can't find the CD listed anywhere else."
5,Killer riffs and awesome vocals!,"Cause and Effect has been likened to Depeche Mode and I suppose that it can be said that there is some similarity there. However, I would have to say that where DM's tunes seem to be ""dark"" in nature and center quite often on religious matters, Cause and Effect is the ""light"" side of that sound.True, both groups share a similar sound and feel, but the ultimate delivery is considerably different between the two groups.I own every one of DM's albums, EPs, and any other DM issue out there. That said, I'm nuts about Cause and Effect.On this album my favorites are Farewell to Arms and You Think You Know Her.I've got all their albums and I'm just itching to get another.Cause and Effect are a band easy to listen to on a regular basis (but then so is DM).Get it you'll like it."
4,after 10 years it's still on my playlist!,"I've always been a big fan of the synth pop muzic. This album is deeper than what a lot of people perceive it to be. Tracks like ""Farewell to arms"", still brings a tingle to my spine. Each track has such a creative sound that really start to feel what the song is all about. That's what music is suppost to do, not all music does that, but this one does. Enjoy!"
4,"""Another Minute"" of synth-pop melodies","This cd is a tribute to the great synth-pop club melodies of the 90's. Powered by Rob Rowe's vocal melodies and the late Sean Rowley's keyboards, it makes for tunes enjoyed by those who like Depeche Mode, Anything Box. They were also a great duo to see live in the clubs."
1,Dollar store Depeche Mode,"Puuhlease! It's cute but why would you want to waste your time with a second-rate Depeche Mode wannabe synth pop group? If you want the real deal, check out some early Depeche Mode and Duran Duran."
5,Eye Opening Little Book,"Francis is most often seen outside in garden statuary, surrounded by birds and other animals. This is the perception most of us have of Francis. Cunningham's book serves to take this image and place it in a historical context. Francis was a devout and very orthodox Christian. He was very literal in his understanding of the mission, life and death of Christ. His understanding led him to radical views on life - while remaining firmly planted in his church and its traditions.This book is part theology, part history, part sociology. It is an easy and thought provoking read, although the teminology Cunningham uses is sometimes theological and obscure to those without some basis is Christianity.I highly recommend this book."
1,What a waste!,"Blegh.Avoid this book -- mediocre, often inaccurate scholarship, dullness of pen, and paens to politically correct personal hobbyhorses fill the body of the book; St Francis himself seems to've been left out. The prose is repetitive and irritating.The only useful section of the book is the final chapter, where Cunningham references better works on St. Francis."
4,One of the best live albums ever.PERIOD.!,"This album is absolutly amazing! I'am only 18 years old and thisgreat band was way before my time and I think that there is no other hard rock band ever like Led Zeppelin. This album is fullof great rare live recordings from the BBC Station. Songs like""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Whole Lotta Love"",""Dazed and Confuzed"" and jaw dropping set of ""Black Dog"". ""Going to California"" is my favorite song on this album. It captures the acoustic side of Led Zeppelin. You should definitly buy this album now! Itsdefinitly worth it."
5,The Most Music Two Discs Can Hold,"This is a must-buy for anyone who likes zeppelin. Great renditions of earlier material you just can't beat an 18 minute dazed and confused, an epic whole lotta love medley, and the first live performance of stairway to heaven. plus it is the only cd where you can get travelling riverside blues (unless you want to spend $70 for the box set), the girl i love, and somethin' else."
4,Great Album,"This is an absolute great album for anyone to buy. I would not only reccomend it to any one who is a big Zep fan, but to anyone who likes classic or hard rock. One good thinga about this album is that it has tracks that you cant get on any of their albums. Like ""Travelling Riverside Blues"" which is one of the coolest Zep songs I have ever heard. If you are even a slight Led Zeppelin fan, go and buy right now I guarantee you wont be let down."
5,Fantastic,"Led Zeppelin, to me, is one of the greatest and probably my favorite British band of the 60's. The Beatles took music in new directions, and the Stones may have made it okay for skinny white kids to like the blues, but Led Zeppelin took the music they loved and transformed it into their very own, pushing the envelope, and making music that is every bit as heavy, and far more intense, than anything around now. And this is coming from a 16 year old kid! The BBC Sessions document Zeppelin at their greatest. The sheer intensity, the joy of playing, and the balls to the wall mentality is captured here, live in concert, in front of a very proper British audience. I'm not going to describe it any further, because nothing I will say can do it justice, but this is one of the very greatest concert documents out there. It's up there with the Who's Live at Leeds."
5,Super,"Any true fans of Zeppelin will like this one. The songs are some of their best and the sound is decent on it too.......I love it, but then, I love them......."
2,Could have picked a better way to ship,"When I got this in the mail, I opened the package to find a cracked case with a couple small pieces missing out of it. The CDs inside were unharmed, but i was a little disappointed to see my new purchase not looking so new. It could have just been packed with some cushion of some sort inside. Perhaps a little bubble wrap. But if you throw away the case anyways, then the distributor was great and it arrived in the mail quicker then i expected."
2,Beginners beware,"I am a 15 year old and just discovering Led Zeppelin. The first music of theirs' I purchased was the three cd remasters set. I loved it and still do, but I was curious to know how they sounded live. It's completely different and I don't like it at all. Stairway to Heaven is my favorite song and this version butchered it! There are certain types of music that sound a lot better live, but Led is not among them. Stick to studio albums. I can see how more hardcore fans might enjoy this, but it's not for me."
4,Zeppelin at their best!,"I think this is the best Zeppelin release to date. While How The West Was Won is nice, I prefer the BBC Sessions. I am however alittle disappointed at this release. On The live version of ""Communication Breakdown"" on disc 1 theres a segment that was edited out, but my main disappointment is on disc 2. The show from April 1st 1971 on disc 2 is amazing in my opinion but Jimmy Page failed to put the wholer show on this 2 CD set. What Is & What Should Never Be and Communication Breakdown weren't included on disc 2 from that 1971 performance. That live version of Communication Breakdown was smokin and a better live version than on disc one. But, over all, I really like this CD. Led Zeppelin sound young, fresh and full of energey. In my opinion, this is a better release than How The West Was Won."
4,The brilliance of Page and Bonham make it shine,"Very enjoyable, with Travellin' Riverside Blues and The Girl I Love . . . alone making this a worthwhile purchase. Two things are abundantly clear after listening to this: First, studio engineers' ability to tone down Plant's vocal histrionics have played a key role in the band's success. He simply is making too much noise on these sessions! Second, their recorded output, as great as it is, would have been even better had the focus been MORE on Jimmy Page, especially if it had captured the tone he lays down in these sessions. Very powerful. Bonham as always is right on."
3,Led Zeppelin-BBC Sessions,"It is a good example of the first few years of Led Zeppeling-however, there is a lot of duplication of songs (three versions of ""Communication Breakdown"" for example)and the first CD plods a bit. That being said, the second CD is an excellent BBC concert from 1971 and, if you enjoy Led Zeppelin, that is why you should purchase this CD>"
3,"Could Have Been 5 Stars, But........","I like this album for the most part, I own every recording by LZ (except some rare imports), including DVD versions and DVD-A (5.1). The second disc is recorded with reasonably good sound for that period. The first disc is MONO not stereo, which ruins it for me. Still a good purchase for any true Zepp fan."
4,Very please to hear this release,"I was very please to hear this double cd which include classics of the band. It is really cool to hear other versions of theses songs.My choices of highlights would be ""You shook me"", ""I can't quit you baby"", ""What is and what shoud never be"", ""Hearthbreaker"", ""Since I've been loving you"", ""Black dog"", ""Stairway to heaven"", ""Going to California"" and ""Thank you"". At last, we have these precious recording of the band with a good sound."
5,Just awesome,"If you love Zeppelin, this is a must have session to have. I can listen for hours, day after day"
3,"Early Zep, early quality","As a life-long Zep fan, I have to say that I have mixed feelings of this album.It's nice to hear Zeppelin in its raw form. However, the sound quality is not up to par for most of this album, which occasionally makes it difficult to listen to.Nevertheless, if you want to hear early Zep, as well as several versions of some of their popular songs, this album should impress you."
5,Zeppelin Stripped Down And Sounding Mean!!,"If you don't know who these guy are by know, where have you been?Zeppelin is arguably the best rock band of all time. They touched many a soul in there short time with us. If John Bonham was still around they probably would have given us at the very least another decade of great music. Oh well hind sight is 20/20 and we all miss John!This cd is Zeppelin at it's best. It's so alive sounding it just crackles with excitement. These guys were masters at their craft and this cd along with the now famous DVD they released a few years back proves it.If you like old school rock?, this is a must have.Any Zeppelin cd is a 10+ and this is no different!!"
5,a perfect must have addition for ZEP fans !,"this cd makes me feel like I am sitting in some small nightclub in Europe in 1969 with a few friends watching these 4 legends play a few songs,these recordings are phenomenal,it's like listening to these songs for the first time again,Plant's voice is totally raw and live.Stairway to heaven is a little overplayed on most FM stations,but this version makes it seem like a new song,and the 18+ min version of Dazed and Confused,well,that speaks for itself.I could'nt be happier with the purchase."
5,no comments,"One should never question an album with Led Zeppelin on it. This one proves that they did it. They rocked the 60s into the 70s. These sessions are raw proof of their live abilities, stay away from the knobs, Satan! If you believe in real music, without overdone overdubs, but just real musicians getting it on at blues and rock, you cannot be wrong buying this one. For everybody else: buy this one and start getting a life!"
5,"Cheesy at times, but succulent nonetheless.","I have to say that I loved this book. I found it at a library book sale, and started it with unease. Within the first few pages, I was hooked.I'm not really sure what it is about this book that's so great, but it is. It's a great romance, one of those meant-to-be stories that are so appealing. Especially since the characters seem to be fighting their feelings for the majority of the book! In addition, it's a delightful mystery. I have to say that this is THE FIRST mystery book I've ever read where I've suspected the culprit before he/she was revealed. That may not say much about the author's craft, but I loved it. For...us more gullible readers out there.All in all, I would definetely say that this is a wonderful book. I read it twice in one day-once you pick it up, there's no puting it back!"
1,Not up to usual standards,"Sorry, but I didn't think this was one of Graham's best. The heroine is too passive, too cowardly, too stupid. 3 Heroine Survival Tips: (1) Got a family history book that details how an ancestress (whom you suspect you may be the reincarnation of) died? Then don't read the tale in 3 separate parts (and chapters), especially if someone keeps trying to kill you. (2) If your boyfriend points out that your family members are the most likely/only suspects, believe him. And, finally, (3) If you're trapped in a burning building and there's a window you can break and jump out of, do so. Don't stand around looking out of the window, confused, waiting for your boyfriend to show up outside and shout up to you ""Break the window and jump!"" Pretty much every woman on the North American continent knows and lives by these rules, and doesn't feel kindly towards fictional characters who don't. And read some of Ms. Graham's other books, they're much better."
4,Fascinating!,"This is more than just your average holiday romance novel. It's filled with dark suspense that had me sitting on the edge of my seat. The characters are complex, the plot is intricate, and the setting (a family business) adds depth and interest. Excellent!"
2,An OK Story !,"I was really wanting to read a Christmas story. Aside from the fact that there is some snow on the ground and a wonderful house in Connecticut,it wasn't much of a holiday read. An OK story however, especially if you believe in reincarnation. Not one of my favorites, but I would venture into another Graham novel if it came highly recommended.Guy De RosaLos Angeles, California"
4,Memorable book,"I love that there is a book on consumer advocacy for children. I really loved this book as a child. The parts that stuck out for me were the descriptions of how the older man made it a great business, like when he would measure out bulk candy by weight for the children, he would put in less than they asked for at first so he could add more. When his son took over the store, the children would see him measure out the candy and then take some out! Just a simple matter of psychology -- they would get 10 cents worth of candy either way but the effect was very different. Of course in the book it was put much more simply.I also loved how the little girl went to the owner's son (who was running it for the time being) and showed him how to run the store so the children would patronize the business again, rather than do nothing and just let the business go under.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I feel the illustrations are not quite up to snuff. But the story is wonderful."
3,John's Review,"The Movie was alright, but I think the cds are better. The plot wasn't really that good and there wasn't really any crank calls in it. The Jerky boys should make video tape of them making crank calls and only sell it on video and not in the theatre."
4,"Good value, but short battery life","These batteries work well. They don't last as long as normal batteries, but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs. If you have kids with toys, these are a must."
1,"Not Really a ""D"" Cell Battery","All these other low score reviews are true. Note these NiMH batteries are rated by their mA Hours, which is how much charge they hold against the appropriate rated load. These will probably work fine in a straight digital radio or other device, but so will regular batteries for a lot less and last you months as well.Motors in kids toys need Real ""D"" Cell which are 1.5V Batteries, these are all 1.2V!!!! 1.5V requirements will not run on 1.2V, it's like sticking a half dead battery in a kids toy. Not only that, you may overload the battery and cause it to overheat, potential leak, or worse.Rayovac does make an Alkaline battery that is rechargeable and is 1.5V. It works well, but has become hard to find. Too bad AMAZON doesn't send out the right notice for the right battery when you put your name in the e-mail Q for a Rayovac Alkaline Rechargeable Battery....uggh!!!!"
2,About the same capacity as a rechargable AA,"They are technically D batteries but when you get them they'll feel very light. In fact they almost seem like an AA battery in a D form factor.After looking at the capacity, go figure. These are rated at 2900 mAh and some AA Duracel I have are at 2050. Better to go with higher capacity batteries."
3,"Ok, for the money",The batteries are OK for the money. Charge will not last the longest but having two sets and always keeping one charged works well.
1,Battery Bleeds Acid,I left these batteries in my elliptical machine for about 3 months and when I went to recharge them I found that they had bled acid all over the place. Don't buy these!
3,Does not hold charge as advertised,"Its a 3 start product. I'd still buy it so i don;t have to throw away toxic batteries, but I'm not happy about it."
5,Works well.,"Have this or my red 25 on when shooting b&w, depends on the situation. Most of the time the situation calls for this Yellow 8 and I love using it. Works well in general b&w shooting, like it better than not having a filter on."
5,A 12-step program is taught which any user - even relative beginners- can easily follow,"Joli Ballew and Jeff Duntemann's Degunking Your PC covers device which don't work property with PCs, from cables which get in the way or won't reach to a slow processor or non-working backup methods. A 12-step program is taught which any user - even relative beginners- can easily follow to tackle everything from setting up a wireless network to updating device drivers and using scans to clean up fragmented hard drives."
1,Do not purchase,Pros: Holds 1GBInexpensiveCons: No way to tell if it's fully chargedNo way to tell when battery is lowPlay time is less than two hours at bestAlways starts at beginning of playlist whenever you turn it onOverall: Seems more appropriate to sell at a dollar store
2,Shoddy hardware,"I purchased this item since its form factor was similar to my iPod shuffle and I wanted to a device that would use wma files - which this did. So far so good.I added files using Windows Media Player and that worked well enough.But when it came time to run with this unit, I was bitterly disappointed. The clip was not strong enoug to secure the player to the waist band on my shorts so I was forced to clip it to the collar of my shirt. It stayed there pretty well. But once I started to sweat and the MP3 player got a little wet, it died completely.I liked the idea of a player that would work with Windows Media Player. And as far as that goes, this device worked just fine. But for someone who wants to wear this while exercising - not the best way to go."
4,Absolutely love this study,"I absolutely this study, it is better the second time around.I have bought and shared several of the books for friends."
5,WONDERFUL,"I am leading this bible study to two different groups each week. We are getting so much out of it and are reading our bibles differently now. Beth has tied so many things together throughout the bible that I love looking for ""clues"" now that will help with other verses in other books of the bible. Recommend very highly."
5,Thanks,"Thank you. It was actually for my sister, so I don't really know how it was. But I am giving a good review because Beth Moore is great."
1,A womans heart - God's dwelling place,This book goes with a DVD set - but it has been updated significantly. It is very disappointing that Amazon are still selling the old version of the book
5,Great Bible Study,"I bought this book for a woman's Bible study at my old church and really enjoyed it. It was my third Beth Moore Bible Study and I've loved them all. The only tough part was finding time to complete each day's work, since it would take about an hour a day and was broken up into 5 days of study between each new chapter. Each week the woman's group would get together and review the previous week's ""homework"" and then watch the next Beth Moore video, and I enjoyed that. I would definitely recommend this Bible study."
5,awesome study,This is a mind blowing Bible study. I would encourage anyone to study with Beth Moore as a teacher. God uses her in great ways. Thanks Beth
5,A worthwhile study,"Beth Moore's study ""A Woman's Heart"" is a great daily Bible study for any christian woman. This study digs deep into God's Word to reveal truths from stories you have heard so many times before. Whether you are new in your christian walk or looking for some meat this study will meet your needs. I recommend doing the study with the dvd. It is available on the Lifeway website."
5,One Bible Study You Shouldn't Miss,"I have been through several Bible Studies and by far, Beth Moore's has been the most insightful, uplifting, and life-changing. Get ready to to be blessed through this wonderful workbook. You won't regret it."
2,"Blurry pictures, not worth it!","This book was very disappointing. As someone stated before, the pictures are very blurry and are video captions. The print is so small, you need a damn magnifying glass to read it. It was not what I was expecting. My advice to all potential buyers is to save your money and just watch the re-runs."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING!!! As stated by previous victims, pictures are small, blurry screen shots from the tv show. Gets 2 stars because the book gives SOME good pointers and gossip into some of the famous peoples' lives or whatever. NOT WORTH IT!"
5,the bite of a gator,"Do you have squeaky belts? replace them with the gator belts.These belts do no slip! They are ribbed in a special way to prevent slippage, unlike the standard belts with boring primitive ribs.I was using a conventional belt on my supercharger and it was slipping and squeaking. Now I have no issues.Thanks Gator belt!"
1,A stupid waste of time and money,"Green Jelly is horrible. The music is poor and the lyrics are stupid. Some of the stuff is funny, but most is just plain stupid. Avoid this CD, its very lame."
3,Jelly-filled.,"When I think of the origins of Green Jelly (Jello), I think of some metal-heads who decided they would have the most fun as a band if they tried to be as stupid as possible. I mean that in a good way. A glance at the album cover should tip you off. Musically these guys are fairly competent, and come off as a decent alt/punk/metal act, (think Gwar or The Dwarves). However, it's lyrically that these guys let loose, and make their name. I'd imagine Beavis and Butthead would love this band. Truthfully alot of it is pretty funny, and they're probably rather smart to sound so not. I have to admit, I only play this disc once a year at most, but I'm glad it's there when I need that fix."
4,"Very stupid, silly, but very funny.","Green Jelly has only made 2 CD recordings, but they are good ones. This is thier first one of two. The music is hard punk rock, and will offend some. (Track 9 has a lot of graphically explicit sexual lyrics.) This CD does not have a parental advisory. So read this and you will know that this is not for kids."
3,"Cute, but tedious","Ok, I'll admit it. I got this one purely for the fact that I saw the video for ""Three Little Pigs"" just like everyone else did. And again, like everyone else, I laughed my head off. I also enjoy crunching power-chords as well. The kind that sound as if they're being beaten on with a hammer. This is good, because this album has a LOT of them. Personally, I think this should have been released as a DVD instead of CD, but that's my opinion. Perhaps one of those ""Enhanced CD"" releases. We certainly seem to have the technology to do it. Beware, though, that this album should only be listened to on certain occasions, and then only in small doses. Burn-out on this album is high, and testimony to this is the layers of dust it has sitting in my CD collection."
3,If it's cheep...,"I bought Cereal Killers for $5 and is was worth it. The only good songs are Anarchy in the UK and 3 little pigs. If you like Metallica and stuff that is absurdly weird,buy it. You can find it in junk bins at CD stores everywhere."
5,I Love this Cd,"from what i read and have reseached, this band only made 2 CD's too bad, because they were great. they were once knowns as green jello, till they were about to be or were (not sure) sued by the jello company. They will always be known as Green Jello to me. When i first heard this CD, i was around teh age of 4-6, I guess my dad had bought it. the only song i ever heard at that age was 3 little pigs. years, later still listening to that song, i decided to listen to the whole album. I enjoyed every single song. litke i havr read some of the songs are not for little kids, but then again i don't care, i would let my offsprings listen to it at an early age. i can't tell you to buy it or not, but i can tell you is that, this album and band are fun to listen too. personally i love the Obey the Cowgod. even now i will occasional pop in the CD and listen to the music.Orion"
2,novelty,"this album will never be more than a novelty, despite a few funny tracks.to the guy who sounded all high and mighty with his tool comment, note that maynard sings ONE line on the entire album, so making a comment like 'hes the vocalist' would be quite an overstatement. sometimes actually using your brain/ears does wonders"
2,Easy Spirit Women's Beach Tower Sandal,"Very cute sandals, but they did not wear well. They started making a ""crunching"" sound after only a few wears. The noise was so loud it was actually making people turn and stare, so I had to stop wearing them. I got them on sale for about $23, but the regular price was much more than that. I would not recommend these shoes at either price. I expected better quality from Easy Spirit."
5,Surprised,It was a thoroughly entertaining book. It opened up my eyes to some of the people that work on the planes. It was a funny book but had some great tips and touching stories as well.
5,"Frankly, Quite a Good Read","I enjoyed this author's writing style and loved the content. It was fun to read it on the airplane and compare as the flight progressed. This book is the first by a flight attendant that doesn't end up whining about his job or the passengers. In fact, he pokes fun of everyone but reserves the biggest punches for himself. My only critiscism is that occasionally he bleeped out some of the more harsh words, which I can understand but it made me feel juvenile. It's not really an air traveler's survival guide but more of an air traveler's observation guide.Verdict: Two thumbs up! My favorite travel book this year so far."
2,A disappointment,"I am sorry to say, I was very disappointed with this book, although it was a very quick, easy, and mildly entertaining read. For the most part, however, that anecdotes were just not very enlightening or humorous, and I had a very hard time getting past the blatant errors (""a very hot August day the day after Bastille Day"" and ""Lederhosen"" = ""suspenders"" come to mind). However, I believe the author is well-meaning and from time to time hits the mark. Just don't expect too much, however."
5,Great Summer Fragrance,"When I first got it, I was not impressed with it much. However, it grew on me extremely quickly. It is more refined smelling than the regular Cool Water. It is definitely a more mature smelling aquatic fragrance. A teenager or an older person could wear this and it would smell great on them, it's extremely versatile. It develops nicely on the skin and has good longevity. It is perfect for a summer fragrance!"
2,"Great scent, lasts for 15 minutes","I thought I had bought a fake product, but the smell is exactly the same as the one I tried at the store. It is a great smell, citrus at start and woody at the bottom. However, it is like that movie title, ""Gone in 60 seconds"". It is literally useless.I have to add that I didn't buy it from Amazon."
5,Oh how this does smell good!!!,"I was first introduced to this cologne about 4 years ago when a student walked past me. I really loved the smell. Well, I saw the student the other day and asked him what kind it was. He told me it was Cool Water Deep. So I looked to Amazon. There it was!!! When we received it, my husband sprayed it on....Oh how I wanted to follow him everywhere!!! The sweet, citrus, musky smell was amazing!!! WOW!!! What an impression!!!I would like to buy enough to last for a long,long time!!"
4,Not bad at all...,"When I think of using this cologne it is probably because I need a powerful and upfront smell that will knock socks off because this cologne is a real noticeable one probably due to its ""top notes of zesty mandarin and kiwi"".Final thoughtsIt was and still is a bit hard on my nose but it comes in handy when you need a long lasting scent that will catch everyone's attention."
4,"Run #3, Fearless","In the novel Run, Sam has been kidnapped, or gone, no oneknows. And a young woman who is in love with him, Glia, is searchingfor him. She goes through many things just for this man. There are specific things she has to do to get to him. Run was a dramatic, action sort of book. I would recamend this for teenagers to read. A ver good book, and interesting to read."
3,Too short,"Needs to be longer books. The story line is good, but I just wish they would give you more for 8.99"
5,One of the best Fearless books!!!,"Of the first 10 Fearless Books, I have to say that this is probably my favorite. The reader learns more about Heather and about what Gaia has to deal with in her everyday life. I thought this book was really interesting and didn't have any slow parts like a few of the Fearless books do. The tasks that Gaia hast to perform to get Sam back are pretty cool, so if you're going to buy any of the fearless books, I suggest this one."
5,"Run : An excellent installment of the Fearless series.,","Fearless #3, Run , is an excellent addition to this amazing new series -- and continues the adventures of seventeen-year-old Gaia Moore, a girl born without the fear gene. Stalked by a predator she can't see, Gaia desperately goes beyond her measures to save the person she loves -- Sam. The tests and the experiences she must go through to save Sam from his kidnapper are mind boggling. Can Gaia pass those tests? Can she survive them? And can she trust the one person she would never, ever trust in her life -- her worst enemy? Francine Pascal once again writes this book with the dark, beautiful style that she uses to write the FEARLESS series -- and in Fearless #3: Run, it only gets better and better."
5,This is the best series I have ever read,I just started reading this series and it is better than any of the others I have read. I am only on #4 but I love these books already. I just got done with #3 and so far I think it is the best. It is really suspensful and makes you not want to stop reading. In this one Sam is kidnapped and Gaia is supposed to pass all of these test and then the kidnappers will give Sam back. But the tests they give her are really mean like playing the video during class and embarassing Ed. In this book Heather makes me so mad because she acts like a.... you know what I mean. I am so glad Gaia and Ed did what they did to Heather at the college Sam goes to. And what makes me REALLY mad is that Heather took all of the credit for saving Sam.
1,Dramatic but fictious on the edges,"While this DVD is dramatic and somewhat realistic, I felt betrayed by the use of Vietnam War era footage including images of F-8 Crusaders, A-4 Skyhawks, F-4 Phantoms and A-7 footage that was represented as operations over Iraq. I understand their need to have filler when they did not have enough original footage of their own. As a Vietnam war air ops veteran, I was disappointed at the false representations. At least there should have been a disclaimer anytime those images were shown."
4,Very pleased,"Very beautiful and comfy shoe..the only flaw I found is that is not well finished, you can notice the glue around the soles. Anyways I bought them quite cheap."
4,Good Fit,"Had never purchased this brand - very pleased with quality and fit. Try it, you'll love it!"
5,Exactly as described... used for about 5 months now without issue.,"Coil stays tight, snug fit connectors, seems well made and exactly what I needed. The blue is a perfect match for my truck! :)"
3,Not enough heat,While I like the ease of use of this grill it is limited as to what you can cook on it. I think it is best suited for fish and chicken. Since a thick steak requires some real heat from the coals to get the grates hot enough to sear in line in the meat this unit does not seem to have enough air movement to get the job done. I haven't given up on it yet but I don't have high hopes for this one. I also got the rotisserie which I have yet to use but it is pretty cheaply made and how long can (1) D battery last? I had the same problem with my small Weber so I might have to switch to gas (God forbid) for the camping trips we take.
4,Nice little grill,"I bought this because it seems to be well engineered. The chimney action is good. It's not as instant heat-up as I thought it would be. I'm not sure what i'm doing wrong but I never get to ""save"" my charcole when I'm done. Closing it up is supposed to extinguish the smolder in them. When I open it up later, it's always a pile of ashes. Still it's nice and space saving. You could get really creative with it if you wanted to."
1,Amazon actions,"---- TWICE I ordered regular scented Consort and TWICE I get the wrong Consort. I grew older with the pleasant scent of Consort but where I live now, no stores keep it on the shelve let alone even know what it is. So I order my favorite SCENTED Consort through Amazon and it seems the UPS codes are screwed up at Amazon and I keep getting the UnScented Extra hold instead. This review is intended to shake up the cage over at Amazon and not to undermind the Consort product. It's not the first time Amazon has screwed up and the hassles involved with the expense of return and time wasted is never compensated for by Amazon. So There!"
5,A wonderful trip to the past,Songs of my era that Al Martino does so well. I enjoyed him then and still do. What a terrific voice.
5,Simply unforgetable!,"This book stands the test of time. About 12 years ago, I read it several times over and over again and loved it more with every read. I would love to read it over and again several times more. I loved it so much that I recommended it and loaned it to friends and acquaintances... and that's where I made my mistake. I loaned it out so many times that I lost track of who had it and I never got it back. It's the best romance book I've ever read and I really hope that I can get my hands on a brand new reprint. As soon as you've finished reading it you'll feel like rereading it all over again."
2,River City High Matures...?,"I remember seeing these guys when they first got things going, and their sound completely blew me away. Unfortunately, my then 16-year-old ears had yet to hear TRULY amazing music; but that aside, they were a fun listen and James has an interesting voice in punk music. The four-song demo I paid five dollars for really showed some promise, and so a few years later, I picked up their major label debut. The songwriting talent I heard in ""Starcrossed"" and ""I Wish On Every Nickel"" was replaced with radio-friendly, pop-punky, harmonized, three-minute ""I've heard this one a million times"" songs. In all fairness, this is a hard-working band, and RCH puts on a fun live show. But with the exception of a few songs (""Left Behind"", ""Runaround""), this effort is disappointing and far short of its capability. Pass on this one and keep an ear out for a new RCH sound."
4,A beautiful jem even with a slight flaw.,"This CD set is an affordable and enjoyable way to get aquainted with Ponchielli's masterpiece, however there is a catch to it's unusual price: you should be aware that it is a live recording of a 1979 San Fransisco Opera Production which unfortunatly produces a recording quality that sounds like it was done in 1939. I recommend the recording because of the fact that it ""is"" live. There is a certain sence of excitment to hear the stage action (i.e. footsteps, doors slaming, etc...). In addition, to the best of my knowledge, there is no formal recording with this all star cast, and as one would expect, the performers are fantastic - just be for-warned that the recording quality is not good."
2,Published in 1997 or 1977?,"This book was very nicely illustrated and the directions were well written. Unfortunately, I probably won't make a single project from this book. It was not what I expected. In my opinion, the projects in this book seem very out-dated and very out of style."
1,Let's Go Back to Tradition,"I love La Sonnambula, I love all Bellini Operas. That long arching line of his arias thrills me to the core. This recording is one to listen to but not watch. The chorus is good, Mei is beautiful, the others do a adequate to good job but the production is painful. The other reviwers were correct and perceptive in their comments, lovely music but ugly production."
3,Not impressed,"This cd is ok, and g-unit cannot put out a bad cd. It's a good cd, just don't expect to be blown away. I had my hopes up when i got it, but was disappointed when i listened to it. A solid purchase though, just don't expect to be bangin it for long."
1,(Laughs),"I cant believe that G-Unit is using GTA: San Andreas' as a ""sample"" for their new mixtape. This CD sucks when I got it bootleg, and thats all I have to say. And also... G-Unit sucks. As for using San Andreas, the rap is ten times better in the game because it includes N.W.A., Dr. Dre, Compton's Most Wanted and Ice Cube. And for the rock, Soundgarden, Faith No More, Helmet, Alice In Chains and Guns 'N Roses. So, if you want real music, listen to the rap and rock listed above, and if you have this album burn it and put out the fire by pissing on it. Or just use it as a coaster."
3,Way Out West '- Intensify,"Way Out West's second album, INTENSIFY, lives up to its name, going in a more solid progressive trance direction right off the bat with ""The Fall,"" a four-to-the-floor stomp that samples the lush strings and vocals from Coldcut's ""Autumn Leaves"" -- it's a pity about the naff NASA samples, though (Bedrock will thankfully take it out with their remix). Way Out West's sense of melodics is still there, though, on the groove of ""Activity"" or in the strings that back up ""Hypnotise."" ""UB Devoid"" ratchets things back up with a few hints of mystery. Kirsty Hawkshaw lends her unique voice to ""Stealth,"" giving that track a gentleness, while Triica Lee Keishall's vocals help prop up ""Mindcircus,"" even if it's not as distinctive. But there's also something missing when compared to their first album. There seem to be a generic feel to some tracks (""Call Me,"" ""Sharkhut""), which drags the album down a bit, but it's still a good, upbeat listen"
5,Truly Impresed,It was my first album I've every bought and I had high expectations from Nick & Jody. I listen to alot of Nick Warren's releases and enjoy alot of Way Out West's work.So I took it home. Shoved it in the ol' CD player and what I heard blew all of my expectations out the window. The quality is unbelievable. I sit and wonder sometimes of how they do it. What do they use. I love listening to it.If You are looking for trance and progressive house this is the album to buy. It is at the top of my collection of CD's. I love this album and so will you. Take a chance. You won't be disapointed.RespectVentilator
2,Unimaginative and Uninspired,"I am not impressed with this album. I had heard an excerpt of 'Mindcircus' on iTunes, and had imagined that the song in its entirety would be massive. On the contrary, cheesy female vocals interlock a repetitive (if otherwise decent and catchy) piano hook. The use of middle-Eastern inspired tunes on 'Secret' is also very uninspired, and midway through the song the beat changes in a way that makes me really just want to stop dancing and put on something cheesier, as long as it had a tighter beat.Very upsetting. This is not an album I would recommend."
1,Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"I really regret purchasing this cd. Intensify is about the worst trance anthem I've ever heard. If you like DJ Tiesto, Armin van Buurin, or Paul van Dyk, you will NOT like this cd. Save your money and stick to the strong mixers listed above."
1,"Dull, wandering, white noise","If this is the music of tomorrow, then I guess I'd be better off listening to a dripping faucet.Most songs consist of beating one idea into the ground, or in the case of several of the 'versions' of them, one idea into the ground for 'Part I', into the subsoil for 'Part 2', and into the bedrock for the 'vocal mix'.Way Out West will never be confused with Brian Eno or Philip Glass, and this CD will never be confused with 'Music for Airports' or 'Einstein on the Beach'."
5,Great Story that parents and kids will love,"This is a super, high quality hardcover with beautiful illustrations. Parents and children will both be drawn in by the story and its characters. Kids will love the colorful (literally!) bears and their endearing personality traits, while parents will enjoy the book for its emphasis on moral values and the importance of good manners. The book would make a wonderful gift for any family, to be cherished for years. I look forward to more adventures with the Bramble Thicket bears!"
4,Worth it,I was given a sample at a spa; used it and worked great. So I purchased this larger product and it works the same.
3,Read the fine print,"Tend skin was first offered to me by my waxing salon; of course, I told them I'd take care of my messed-up lookin abs on my own and found the same product for 1/4 of their price on Amazon. I have about 30+ ingrown hairs across my abs due to epilation/waxing, and has started becoming irritated over the past couple months and realized I need a solution quick.However, Tend Skin doesn't promote the ingrown hairs from being taken out easier, all it does it make the redness go away - it's a symptom cure, not a problem cure. So yea it works if you gotta be at the beach but by the end of the day you're still in the same boat; it's NOR like sacrylic acid, nor a form of exfoliation, and it won't make tweezing out those ingrowns any easier which was my impression."
2,Not Exactly What I Wanted,"The product arrived quickly, however, since there was NO real description of the product (like 1 or 2 speed), I ordered it. It has only 1 speed - VERY FAST! So, I'm spending money to have my old 2 speed repaired."
3,Sparkles?? Not sure yet!,"Did anyone else see sparkles all over their skin after applying tend skin?? Or is this some new ingredient. I am totally serious, the entire area where I applied it is shiny, sparkely, and glittery looking. It's pretty, but I don't see how that will help irritation, or where it is coming from (which ingredient?).Also, I don't believe I have ingrown hairs yet, I just got bikini waxed yesterday, so why did the waxer say to put this on 24 hrs after...i guess to prevent them? However, I do have a couple irritation bumps, and am worried this weird cracked out sparkle version of tend skin they gave me is not helping. Any ideas?As for the smell, this is nothing compared to a shot of tequila or everclear :)...it's really not bad at all! So far, I would recommend it as it was highly recommended in the salon, it feels gentle when applying, and does not have such a bad order. Other options such as calomine, to me, would seem much more nasty smelling!"
2,Didn't Work For Me,"I used this product several years ago and it didn't work for me.Smells like alcohol so it will burn like hell if you apply it to broken or bruised skin.I also have to agree with other reviewers that it can definitely dry your skin. So I guess if you have sensitive skin, then be careful.Everyone's skin is different. Mine is tough, but thin."
2,Tend skin not tender enough,I have tried this product several times and each time It doesn't fit my needs. I still have shaving bumps and itching. This product doesn't work for me.
3,Expensive and maybe not worth it!,I bought this for my son because I heard rave reviews. He was greatly disappointed. It appeared watered down (not potent) and didn't work at all. I've found recipes online for homemade Tend Skin that's made with alcohol and aspirin and it seems to work much better. I found this product way too expensive and not worth it.
1,Waste of money,I tried it for 2 weeks morning/night. No difference. Burned slightly but I literally could tell zero difference in my skin condition. Waste of money. Would never order again.
5,Great product,"This product is great if you have the problem of ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Being a man of color, (African American) this has always been a problem and I've used inferior products. Until I walked into a beauty supply store on 8th Ave in NYC. The rep there recommended this product and my razor bump/ingrown hair problem went away. Now I make sure I always keep a supply on hand. And the travel size is great when I'm on the go. Can't live without it!"
5,Awesome stuff,"I am a woman with a long hairline, and have a short haircut, so my neck requires a close shave with a razor. My stylist recommended this product. I use it every day. It is also great for clearing blemishes!"
3,Does the job,Although I havent had any major improvements using the product. I will reorder and continue trying it for another couple months to see if there are any differences
3,smells really bad,"not all it's cracked up to be, but works OK. the other thing to keep in mind is that THIS STUFF STINKS!"
2,Works OK but I switched,I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead. I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit. Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps!
3,Did not work as well as expected,"I had high hopes for this product, but I stopped using it after about 2 weeks.It worked okay, but I still have many ingrown hairs left. It seems like it is a product I would have to use for the long run, and it's just too expensive for that. I stopped using it because my hands started to peel too much, so I would recommend using gloves every-time you apply the solution."
4,tend review,This product does exactly what it is designed to do ... stop razor bumps and ingrown hairs. The 8oz bottle is a real steal. I just want to give a shout out to the Tend Skin The Skin Care Solution Company for such an outstanding product!!! Thanks
2,Not Impressive,"At the urging of a cosmetologist who does my waxing,I bought a bottle of TS for use on my bikini line. I get the worst red bumps and ingrowns there, I'll try anything. I bought a bottle, have used half of it, twice a day as directed. It started to work well but now I am back to the bumps.TS is over priced..what a waste! I am going to try Emjoi's After Epilation Cream. I hope it will do a better job."
3,It's OK.,"I get some seriously bad ingrown hairs from time to time. Tend Skin was one of the first products I found which claimed to help.Now it may help some people, unfortunately it did not help me. The problem was the Alchol in Tend Skin. As far as I can tell it is the main ingrediant. The Alchol dried out my skin and burned like hell after a shave which caused irritation and that lead to... ingrown hairs.The product is also difficult to buy as well, no local stores stock it and when you need it you have to order it online. But it has to be shipped GROUND, because it's alchol content violates some regulations on packages that can be sent AIR."
5,Works!,"I get ingrown hairs on my legs from shaving. It's pretty severe, and I'd say this product has reduced the severity by about 80%. I don't find that it burns very much, just a little sting. I use it twice a day, put a bit on a cottonball and rub it on the affected areas morning and night. For people who suffer from ingrown hairs it's definitely worth a try. Saw a difference within a week."
5,Excellent product,"I continue to be happy with this product, it works wonders. Could there be something better? I'm not sure there is."
4,Tend Skin works,"I've struggled with razor bumps since I was very young. The ingrown hairs wreaked havoc on my efforts to shave and always looked as though I had back acne that just wouldn't go away, no matter how old I got. I discovered Tend Skin about five years ago and have not had a problem since. The only drawback is that it can cause a discoloration in shirt collars. Otherwise, it works really well."
4,no more red bumps,I recently purchased this product for my senstive skin to shaving. I use it only once daily and it really seems to be helping. No more red bumps!
5,Best Product,"Tend Skin is the best product I have ever used. It gets rid of razor burn, bikini bumps and ingrown hairs. I recommend this product to all my friends and family."
1,did not work for me.,this product did not work for me. I got it to stop and reduce ingrowed hairs on my legs. It made them worse. Will not buy any more of this product.
3,It's okay,"I've been using this product for one week now. It has been working good on my underarms, but hasn't been working as well on my bikini area. I don't know how long it's suppose to take to start working though. I am going to try to continue to use it on my bikini area for another week or so to see if I see a difference."
2,not as good as it used to be,"I've used this product off and on several times over the last few years. At first it was much more potent and worked almost instantly to cure razor bumps and irritation. However, i've noticed over the last couple of years or so the price continues to increase and the product itself seems more diluted and less effective. My last expensive bottle has almost no effect on my skin whatsoever. And I do use it as directed.My advice would be to save a lot of money and use Clean & Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent (with salicylic acid). It is just as effective, if not more so than TendSkin."
2,Too expensive for what it is - just make your own,"I tried this years and years ago and it was useful but SO expensive. I recently found a make your own version on line and decided to give that a try on a weird bumpy ingrown hair patch on my leg from waxing. Five ounces rubbing alcohol, two and a half ounces witch hazel, twenty-six aspirin. Throw in the blender and pulverize. Apply with a cotton ball. It made a huge difference over night - worked better than I remember the tendskin working. This is ridiculously expensive for what you're buying - try the cheap route first."
2,Smelly Smelly,I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. The irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. One good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! Just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!
2,I used to use tend skin,I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead. I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit. Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps!
5,Works on Binkini area!,"This is the only thing that has worked for me. The bikini area is such a sensitive area, so I was worried it would irritate it further. If you wait a couple minutes after you get out of the shower, it hurts less, but after a few weeks its wonderful and I don't even have to use it every day anymore! Only downfall is the smell, it goes away really fast but is kind of stinky."
4,Works Fairly Well,"Works pretty well at stopping ingrown hairs on the bikini area for me. The product does burn on freshly shaved skin so wait a few hours before putting it on. The scent is not great, very strong medicinal/chemical smell, but fades quickly within about 30 seconds.I would recommend this as I've continued to use it with great results."
5,Does what it says it will.,I can really tell a difference between when I use this product and when I don't. It makes a huge difference in reducing ingrown hair between waxing.
2,No idea if it really works.,"I bought this from eStores-LLC. They sent me a product that was expired 6-months, which I didn't realize until after I'd used it some.Whether the product is really useful, I cannot say. But it didn't really help me."
1,Crumbles away,I purchased this product because I loved the colors and I couldn't find it in the store any longer. There is something about the consistency of the product that causes it to crumble immediately. I would not buy this again.
1,A waste of money,Don't buy it. You're better off saving your money for a much better product than this piece of junk. Avoid it at all costs.
5,Fantastic aftershave,"Ladies and gentlemen,I've been using this product for 5 years since I started waxing, and after I recommended it to a male model who shaves his chest, he thanked me when his redness and bumps ceased to exist. I use it for 3 days prior to waxing and a few days afterward. You'll have no bumps and will get every last hair. As for shaving, it's amazing (but sometimes it really burns for a minute). It is unscented and leaves your skin feeling softer.The downsides of this product: 1) It's not cheap, and it's addictive. Don't buy the 4 oz. bottle because it's a rip-off. 2) Last winter I used it for a week and my entire hand (which I used to apply it) peeled... so be warned. It hasn't happened since."
2,Tend skin evolves!,"I have used Tendskin since college and while I can't say that I like it, it does work. My girlfriend introduced me to the Min Solution2 and I gave it a try. It works much better and I think the roller ball applicator is genius! It smells really clean too and a bit minty."
1,Are they serious?,"I mean seriously, its just a horrible smelling bottle of alcohol. It burns like mad. When I went to return it. Of course their customer service never answered and tried emailing them too but to no avail. Had to cancel it via my CC company and got my money credited back eventualy. Dont waste your money."
5,Tend Skin,Works great! I don't use it on a regular basis. But when I do it seems to clean pores and clear up any bumps.
2,my skin burned,wow my skin burned after i applied it! it works but it burns. i don't use it anymore i won't again
5,This stuff works!,"I've been a daily user of Tend Skin for over 10 years now, and it is a lifesaver for someone who suffers from razor burn. I have very coarse, curly hair, so I am constantly getting ingrown hairs and other issues when I shave.I tried everything and when I came across this, it was the only thing that ever came close to actually preventing bumps after I shave.As a plus, this also seems to help if you have a pimple or breakout."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this product based on the reviews but I was not as lucky as these people... It didn't help me at all. I bought it for my legs, to use it after I shave and although I keep using it, I don't see any improvement. What a waste of money!!!"
1,It hurts!,"I don't shave too often, so until recently I had used the more generic brand items to mitigate razor burn. I was optimistic about an upgrade, but disappointed shortly after when I used this product. It was rather abrasive, and left a light rash on my skin for about an hour after use."
2,so so,"I have used this product for over a year and have repurchased several bottles so I feel qualified to write a review. Does it work? eh...only a little. I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over. Eventually, I grew tired of spending the money on this and stopped buying. The only thing that has helped with the incessant razor bumps under my arms has been laser hair removal. Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer so I don't even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine. And because I don't need to shave as often, I don't experience razor burn. Yes, laser hair removal is expensive, but cheaper than using this product for the rest of my life! In general, I don't recommend this product because it doesn't work well enough to warrant the steep price tag."
2,Doesn't work for my ingrowns,"I wanted this product to work, but unfortunately it has not. I get horrible in-grown hairs from brazilian waxing and I needed something to at least lessen them in number. I purchased tend skin based on the great reviews, and was so excited to try it out. I can't tell a difference at all. I'm still getting the in-growns, I guess I will have to try something else."
5,Great product,The result was amazing! I've used it for just three weeks and all the in-grown hairs and bumps have disappeared.
4,"Came Quickly, Words Well","I would recommend this product to anyone, I think the reviews were pretty helpful. If this product didn't completely eliminate ingrown hairs then it was because I probably didn't use it often enough. Even when I didn't use it every day, it at least reduced the problem. There are no other products out there that can do this and for the price I paid, I am incredibly happy."
2,Burns and smells,I used this after shaving and it stings like crazy. It's too smelly for daily use. I'm not sure if it made much of a difference in my skin. If it was milder and smelled better I would use it more often and perhaps see better results.
3,It's okay...I guess.,"I really didin't have a chance to use it as I guess it should have been used, but for the most part the product was pure meh."
3,It's alright,"I used this stuff for about 2 years before stopping. First of all, it's really expensive - and really easy to make yourself (cheaper) according to my sister who is in pharmacy school. Second of all, it burns like hellllll. I even have a fair pain tolerance. Thirdly, I stopped because it didn't seem to be working like it used to. I switched to Anthony's logistics for men - still expensive but doesn't sting and works wonderfully."
2,USED ON RAZOR BUMP AND BURN.,"RUBBING ALCOHOL WORKS JUST AS WELL FIRST BOTTLE APPEARED TO BE WORKING AND IS A BIT PRICEY, GUESS IT IS O'KAY."
2,Burns and Smells,"I read the reviews and really thought my boyfriend would like this product for his razor burn, turns out it has a smell that he doesn't like. It is not a strong smell but enough that he doesn't want to use it. Even if he could get over the smell I think the burning that it causes his skin is also a problem. I will not purchase this item again."
2,Works with some consequences,I'm an African American women and decided to use it on the razor bumps in bikini area--BAD IDEA! It got away of the razor bumps but after using it for only a week the my skin got really dry and started to peel a little. I stopped using it of course but now I have some darkness in my bikini area where I used the solution.
2,Worthless.,"Did nothing for my ingrown hairs or for preventing any. Just buy witch hazel or rubbing alcohol, they probably work better."
1,Overpriced rubbing alcohol,This is just rubbing alcohol. The only thing this product did was dry out my skin. I would definitely recommend the bump stopper products over this.
3,Havent Seen a Difference,"I have been using this product for a little over three weeks and have not noticed any type of change; I will keep using and see if I notice any improvement.However, if I do not see a difference when this bottle is over I will not be re-purchasing---that would seem like a waste of money!"
2,Good Stuff,Tend Skin is a excellent product for me. It allows me the the freedom of shaving with a razor and having the to knowing that Tend Skin will prevent routine shaving irritation and razor bumps.
5,Tend,This product has been wonderful for us. My son had severe problems with bumps from shaving and this product has really helped to clear them up.
4,Why it burns,"ingredients:isopropyl alcohol, water, propylene glycol,acetylsalicylic acid,cyclomethicone, glycerin. I'm a bikini bump person and when I saw all the alcohol I was disappointed. First of all that's why it smells so bad and burns. I have used alcohol on my bikini line before and it didn't work well enough to continue use but the Tend did get rid of the red spots and bump in 5 days so one of the other ingredients must be helping. I have very fine hair that just grows under the skin rather then coming through so Tend does not work completely on prevention for me but I can see how this would help daily shavers. This worked well enough to justify giving another similar and equally expensive product a try to find my perfect fit."
4,Works great to clear up razor burn!,"I gave this a whirl to clear up some nasty razor burn on my neck that was very irritating since I shave every day and never gave it a break. This stuff works as instructed; I used it after shaving in the morning and again at night on the irritated area, and in about five days the razor burn was almost completely gone. Only downsides are that it has a strong smell when first applied and it stings and itches just after it is applied, but that goes away within a matter of minutes. Ultimately, it did what I wanted it to do!"
4,"Prevents ingrowns, but harsh","It does a good job of preventing ingrowns, but is very harsh on your skin. I use it for my bikini area, and I would suggest just using it three times a week. If you use it every day, your skin will get very dry and might peel!"
1,I agree 100%,"I have used this product for a year now. Yes, it pretty much works but it burns something HORRIBLE. I literally need to prepare for it. Also, I don't understand how I am supposed to use it on my neck! I guess they want me to use a cotton ball or pour it onto my hand and slap it on there like after shave??? Probably the only thing that I really liked about it was the gold cap but that got all CRUSTY after a few uses because the alcohol literally ate off some of the gold paint."
5,BEST treatment ever for ingrown hairs,This product is amazing! It has helped me soooo much with my ingrown hairs. I highly recommend it to all women for the bikini area.
1,No Thank You,"I bought this stuff because I heard it helped with razor burn. My husband likes me to shave a bit more often than I liked, well, too bad for him!! The pain from putting this stuff on was WAY WORSE than any sort of razor burn! No thanks!!"
5,Razor Bump Cure,I've been using this product for several years and it is the best way of preventing ingrown hairs. Yes the smell is strong but it's better than razor bumps any day.
4,Stuff Really Works,"Im A Black Man And I Get Bumps BUt I used this stuff the bumps where gone in a matter of a week, the only thin im not to hott about is that it didn't take away the bump black spot! but product works great i will continue to use!"
2,It's OK but I found something better finally!,I use about a bottle every summer and don't love this product (who could!):) but it works pretty well. I found on Amazon Solution2 and gave that product a try. It's definitely a nicer product. It doesn't sting nearly as much which is a big deal for me and I LOVE the roller ball application.
5,A miracle in a bottle,"I have struggled with razor burn in my bikini area for years. I purchased this product after reading many reviews and am EXTREMELY satisfied. This is product works miracles. I shaved my bikini area, applied the product, and have had absolutely no redness, itching, ugly bumps. I am so pleased with this product. I will be a lifetime user."
4,Tend skin the skin care solution for unsightly razor burns,I started using this product mid-fall of 2010. It did a wonderful job on my razor burns. My ingrown hair has been more of a challenge. I keep a bald head shave and chin/facial hair shave gets done once a week. My coarse hair or sensitive skin is prone/vulneralbe to ingrown hair and razor burns. This product has significantly reduced the incidence of new ingrown hair but unfortunately nothing it has not relieved those already beneath the skin. It does burn a little on contact with the skin but I have learned never to be bothered by such a short lived discomfort. This product has allowed me to risk shaving my pate and face/chin more than once a week sometimes without worry of the razor burn or ingrown.
4,Works pretty well,"Maybe not the ""miracle"" others say it is, but it definitely has made a difference. Also, amazon has a great price, considering that at Sephora the 8oz sells for $35 plus shipping."
5,Big UFC fan,Helped me fill in the holes in my collection. Now have 1-152. These came in a bubble pouch or cardboard sleeve which did its job just seemed a little flimsy
1,Disappointing. Not for Witches.,"I'm always looking for a good story with a Witch twist, but this one was very disppointing. The only reason I finished the book was because I kept hoping it'd get better. In the end, I skimmed though most of it because it really wasn't holding my attention. I agree with another reviewer that this was another book that did not show Witchcraft in a good light even though it did try. Another bone to pick was that this definately wasn't a mystery! I don't recommend it and the book is in my recycling bag. The reason why I gave it 1 star is because it's like a bad show on tv, or a B rated movie, sometimes when you've nothing to do, you might as well watch/read it."
1,Boring and pointless pornography.,"Ms. Zavala's talent in writing is downright horrible. The characters' speech is dry, unrealistic, and fluffy. The story was just ridiculous. It seems like every other chapter there are long, obscene, and disgusting sex rituals that left me gagging... This also perpetuates a false look on Wicca and its practitioners. They do *not* run around having gratuitous sex with various partners of their coven at the same time to encourage magical growth. Also, spells don't have to be cast in the nude to ensure efficiency...Overall, the first quarter of the book is only somewhat interesting and the rest is a flight of tasteless oversexual fantasy, with a big fat ""RELIGIOUS"" label slapped on. It gets one star since it actually delves into the esoteric world, but if you want to read a better occult mystery, get ""Bell, Book, and Murder"" by Rosemary Edghill. Don't waste your money on this glorified garbage."
5,A real life-changer,"I just bought my third one of these. I have one at home, one in our vacation condo, and now one for the car. It's a real life-saver for me; with chronic back problems (spondylolisthesis) I was very limited and in frequent back pain until I got these. The problem is chairs without proper lumbar support; the solution for me has been this product. I even take it to restaurants (in a small bag) so that I can relax and not have to leave in a hurry because my back is going out.NOTE: I do NOT advise getting the similar-looking ""Carex Lumbar Support."" It is smaller, much softer, and gives almost no support at all."
5,posture,I believe the Carex Contour Back Cushion is helping me with a posture problem.It's easy and comfortable to use.
4,Back cushion,"Thank you. My order came quickly and easily, as promised. The quality was very good for the price and the back support is very good. I only wish that it came with something that would adhere it to the shape of the back of my office chair."
2,"Give him an ""E"" for effort...","I've enjoyed Jimmy Buffett's music for 30 years, and have appreciated both his highs and lows (that's what keeps it interesting). Although I admire his departure from the formula music of the past several years, this is ""elevator music"" at best. Even his vocals lull the listener to sleep with a predictable monotone. I'll give him an ""E"" and look forward to his next inspiration."
3,After the Party,"If you're looking for typical Buffett party material, this isn't it. At first, I was disappointed with this latest Buffett effort. I usually turn to Buffett to take me away from the stress of the modern world, to a fantasy place. I do find myself going back to it occasionally, but not as often as most other Buffett discs. I guess it fills a gap -- nice after-party music for when the guest leave and you're just taking it slow. If your a true Parrot-head, you probably should own this one too."
3,Don't buy just because Buff's name is on it!,"Not a bad CD. Not an outstanding CD either. This is not a disc to take to your next beach party. I bought it expecting Fins-esqe music. Buyer be warned: lots of accoustic guiter, James Taylor vocals, and an excessive amount of country twang. This is strictly for hard core Parrot Heads - Bubba isn't trying to make any converts on this mission."
1,NOT for the Buffett Fan,"... This CD is terrible, and Im a die-hard Parrothead from South Florida !! A collection of ultra slow ballads, some of which I swear Jimmy fell asleep in the middle of. Then a few of those songs yhat arent really songs, just Jimmy talking to himself. The last 3 songs were ok, but sounded similar to some of his older songs. No catchy rhythms or verses, just boring tunes and your glad when their over. ..."
1,I think Jimmy's gone to the well one too many times...,"I've hung on every line since JB's early days and relished every release since then. The old stuff is incomparable and wonderfully classic; but, each new album lacks the magic that brought all of us aging Parrotheads through many a tropical situation or made us laugh at life's little quirks. This new album reflects that ebbing trend, in my opinion. JB is still the last word in the type of music he pioneered and shared with us, but I think the well is drying-up. And maybe it should... He's covered as many bases as is humanly possible in his art style! I'll keep buying 'em if he records them, but I think we're due a magic trick! :)"
2,Long Time Parrot Head,"I am beginning to wonder if JB is running out of things to sing about. The mood of the album is subdued and reflective, (much like Beach House) and it lacks originality. The lyrics and music sound like they were derived from previous albums and a few songs sound like nothing more than filler. What is a Jimmy Buffett album without a single steel drum or a harmonica?"
1,This is bad....,"OH MY GOD>>> Jimmy, go spend your money and stop making lame music!! This one is terrible... Time to put Jim away and plug in some John Hiatt or Neil Young, some talent... Run away from this one...."
1,Things change!,"Yeah It's changed all right..I guess MONEY does change everything. Long are the days of the creative singer songwriter that used to give a damm about his art. Now it's obvious that he can throw any `ol [junk] out without caring about if people will like it or not..He's made his Billions (and it shows). And most disturbing to me is not having made the slightest reference to the Attack on Sept. 11th, you'd think he would have some gratitude to the people who made him a success. My hat goes off to Neil Young."
3,"""Buffetts Dark Side of the World""","I have been a Buffett fan for many ,many years and have all his 33 cd's.Although this cd does not have your very upbeat ""party"" sounding music ,that all of us PH have come to enjoy over the years,it is JB!! There are many tunes that remind me of Paul Simons intro into South African music styles.All in all if you are a JB fan ...BUY IT!!"
4,Bring on the Margharitas and the Sun,Jimmy is at it again....I love his story telling lyrics. Keep going Jimmy because we know you will be the Last Man Standing..!!CP
4,"...improvement over ""Beach House ...""","After ""Beach House..."" I was kind of tentative in buying this one, but figured [why not]. First reaction is that the man actually sings! Not the bored, lackadaisical manner in which he recites from his last few albums (including the live one). A reputable producer this time probably had something to do with it. Of course, it doesn't hold for all songs (esp. the Sonny Landreth cover). The songs are good but the ""hokey pokey"" joke is been used for a long while now. But it certainly is an improvement from ""Math Suks"" on the last album.Overall, it's a good album and ranks closer to his mid 90's work (excluding the awful ""Banana Wind""). He sings with feeling, the songs are a little more meaningful rather than the usual fluff (probably because he didn't write a lot this time) and the sound and playing are somewhat inspiring. At least, this doesn't sound like an excuse to tour album, not that he needs one."
4,Ignore the naysayers,"Reading many of the negative reviews, it reminds me of an incident at one of his shows a couple of years ago. Jimmy downshifted for a slower song and the guy commented to his friend: ""I have been a fan forever but I hate a lot of his new stuff."" The song? Woman Goin' Crazy on Caroline Street.Jimmy Buffett has always been first and foremost a storyteller. I don't know why so many people want him to keep telling the same story over and over.This is a solid recording of Jimmy's stories of following la vie dansante. Not his best but a very worthy addition."
2,Disappointing,"As a long time Buffett fan who ""tries"" to go to his concerts in Atlanta (any tickets available?), I was very disappointed by this CD. Too much talking and too little singing for me. I think he is entirely too self-absorbed in this CD to produce any good cuts. He is much better when he's having fun. I would rate this one right down there with ""Carnival""."
4,"Good, clean, crisp musical landscape","Nice stuff here. Buffett creates some pretty muscial landscapes with interesting stories. Blue Guitar is upbeat island music,Mademoiselle is flowing acoustic smoothness,Autour du rocher is slow hip hoppish reggae that actually works! Savannah Fare you well returns to smooth classic Buffett. If you liked Banana Wind, Fruitcakes, Barometer Soup- this cd replaces 'Carnival' as the next in the procession of solid, dependable, Buffett. Nothing really new here, but no missteps either. An easy cost effective trip to the far side of the world."
5,73 year old Parrothead likes this new Bubba,"I'm an old Parrothead, but I'm not dead.I love this new CD, because it shows an older, wiser Bubba.Fans of his earlier work are going to hate cut 3, but I love it. Jazzy, cool, and sly. I'm not as impressed with ""Savannah, Fare You Well"" but I do love ""Tonight I Just Need My Guitar"".I think it has to do with where you are in your life. TIJNMG suits me at my age. Bubba shows us he knows how lucky he is. I'm lucky, too, and I think the song is as near to perfect as it gets.I also really like ""What If the Hokey Pokey is Really What It's all About"", a tune most loyal fans detest.I'm not a purist, so I like the direction Bubba's gone with this CD. I hope he continues to grow and stretch his musical wings.Go, Bubba. I'll follow where ever you lead."
3,Latest from Buffett a pleasant taste...,"The latest from Buffett leaves a pleasant taste of the tropics with you. The arrangements and musicians are as good as ever and the lyrics typically teasing. Some of the songs are a bit hum-drum, very similar to ""Beach House on the Moon"" but the classic ones more than make up for it. The last three songs on the CD provide a great 15 minutes of listening.The disc is a bit on the mellow side, but that is where Jimmy does some of his best work. Theme can be summed up with the title of one song--""What if the Hokey-Pokey is really what it's all about?""Enjoy!"
1,I HAVE YOUR UNDER MY SPELL SO BUY EVERYTHING I PUT OUT,"One ok song, two at the most. Keep putting these albums out though because you know all your fans will keep on buying them. Time to stop figuring out how to make more money and sit down and think about...your writing. Havn't had a great album since FRUITCAKES. So, let your executives and accountants figure out where to open the next Margaritaville and how to make sure that you keep raking in the money and then maybe you can concentrate on becomeing the person you used to be such a long time ago."
5,"""Beach House on the Moon, Part II""","It's got the feel of his 1999 album in some aspects, but there are some darn good songs on this CD. ""Blue Guitar"" starts out with some ""African-style"" chants. Only downside of that is that it's just a bunch of ""Heya Heya"". If you want African chants, then ""The Power of One"" soundtrack is for you. But it's still a good song.The title song ""Far Side of the World"" is definately the best of this CD. It just.. ""oozes Jimmy"". It's just Buffett at his best.All the songs are a good mix of what a reviewer mentioned earlier. It's also a good ""travel CD""."
3,"1/2 Good, 1/2 Really Bad!","As a long time fan, I give every Buffett CD a try. I even try to listen to Beach House on the Moon. This CD is not as bad as Beach House on the Moon, but the 8 minute plus song, ""Autour Du Rocher"" might be the worst Buffet song ever. I can't believe that no other reviewer has mentioned this! ""Blue Guitar"" starts out great, and leaves you hanging in the end. The last 4 songs are good, but even the good songs lack any enthusiasm. ..."
3,What a major disappointment!!,"First of all, I've read many reviews that say something like: ""Any TRUE Parrothead will love this album.""Well, I'm not sure how they define ""True Parrothead"" but I consider myself to be one and I was disappointed by FSOTW. I followed Bubba for years, have most of his albums, and rarely miss a concert. When I received word of its release, I preordered this CD. I couldn't wait to see what J.B. had up his sleeve.After receiving, and reviewing, this CD I'm disappointed and I think it is obvious that Jimmy has writers block. His release of ""Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays"" leads further proof to this. (Don't get me wrong, I loved BLTTS, great compilation.)Most of the songs are slow, sort of depressing, and nothing that you'd play at a party. This is not at all what I expected from the Mayor Of Margaritaville.my advice, buy this album used or wait until it hits the budget shelf at your local record store!"
4,Back to the slower Buffett,"This album seems to be more like some of Jimmy's earlier music, a little slower paced and relaxing. Maybe Jimmy is slowing down a little bit in his ""old age"" but I think the album fits in well with the rest of the Buffett music. It's nice to see an album with all new songs for a change."
4,A throwback to the days of poignant ballads!,"For the most part, this album is a beauty! Well-crafted selections like ""Savannah Fare You Well,"" ""All The Ways I Want You,"" and ""Someday I Will"" remind me of some of Jimmy's more thoughtful, introspective and satisfying songs of old. If you prefer songs like ""He Went to Paris,"" ""I Heard I was In Town,"" ""Incommunicado,"" etc. to corny [songs] like ""Math Suks"" and ""Cousin in Miami"" then you'll probably really enjoy this album. Covering Bruce Cockburn again on this album results in another heart-wrending, inspired ballad! ""All the Ways I Want You"" is just as beautiful as ""Pacing the Cage"". Cockburn is a songsmith of the Jesse Winchester/Steve Goodwin caliber. I could have done without ""Hokey Pokey"" and some of the pointless chatter that precedes some of the songs (he started doing that on Fruitcakes and it's pretty annoying!). Overall, though, this is a terrific album. If you prefer the ""ballads"" to the ""bars"" on the box set, then get this new one."
4,Jimmy's Done It Again!,"Since I preordered the CD over a month ago seems I had to wait forever for it's release, but glad to say I wasn't dissappointed! Though this CD won't sound like some of his usual stuff, ie. ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" etc., it's good to hear Jimmy is growing musically and emotionally.""Savannah Fare You Well"", ""Someday I Will"" and Far Side of the World"" are my personal favorites, and show a more mellow and introspective Buffett.If this is an indication of his new direction I'm certainly looking forward to his next release. Love you Jimmy!"
4,World View,"Far Side Of The World finds a more pensive and reflective Jimmy Buffett. The album finds him returning more to the country-folk stylings of his earliest work and the results are pleasing. Songs like the tittle track, ""Savannah Fare You Well"", ""Last Man Standing"", ""Someday I Will"" and ""Tonight I Just Need My Guitar"" have real heart and show that Mr. Buffett has more on his mind than just fun in the sun. If you're looking for ""Cheeseburger In Paradise"", you may be disappointed, but if longed for Mr. Buffett to record more songs like ""Come Monday"", then you will be more than happy with the release."
2,This CD Won't Have You Breaking Out a Blender,"Not the Buffet I was looking forward to hearing. Except for a few decent songs I find the album to be lackluster and boring. ""Someday I will"" and ""Far Side of the World"" show some promise. Sadly I found myself skipping to the next song on several occasions. Disappointing to this long time Buffet fan."
2,Jimmy has left the building,"I am a huge fan for over 20 years, and own every album and cd up to this point. This CD was a big disappointment. Nothing on this one that even resembles Jimmy's style. None of the ""Take me Away"" soul found here that parrottheads thrive on. Sorry to say that the best is definitely in the past."
2,Far side of my CD collection,"You know how you flip through your CD collection and run across an album you've nearly forgotten about, slip it in and you remember *this is a GREAT album*?This isn't one of those albums.It's far and away better than the Beach House On The Moon, but still quite away from the Buffett of earlier albums.Maybe that's what I miss, those albums where it could just as easily be JB with his guitar and a few other instruments--and that's all you need. Now, there's just so much going on in the song, you lose the words. Which, as gifted as a singer-songwriter as Jimmy is, is just lacking.Luckily, you can see the flicker of the muse returning on this album, but it's not the classic Buffett of 10 years ago, or earlier."
2,where's the caribean beat?,"I've been a parrothead for over thirty years and I must say I never thought i'd say this.This CD will take some getting used to. No rock and roll caribean conga line music here.I love this man and his music with all my heart, but...I think I wasted my money on this one for it will never be played like all the others and beleive me, I have them all. I have 2 copies of many of them.(cd's and cassettes) I have to be able to play them in the car or in the portable or the house.Looking forward to this year's concert hoping it will be all old stuff, and none off this CD at all."
3,What a major disappointment!!,"First of all, I've read many reviews that say something like: ""Any TRUE Parrothead will love this album.""Well, I'm not sure how they define ""True Parrothead"" but I consider myself to be one and I was disappointed by FSOTW. I followed Bubba for years, have most of his albums, and rarely miss a concert. When I received word of its release, I preordered this CD. I couldn't wait to see what J.B. had up his sleeve.After receiving, and reviewing, this CD I'm disappointed and I think it is obvious that Jimmy has writers block. His release of ""Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays"" leads further proof to this. (Don't get me wrong, I loved BLTTS, great compilation.)Most of the songs are slow, sort of depressing, and nothing that you'd play at a party. This is not at all what I expected from the Mayor Of Margaritaville."
4,garmin city select v6,"I use this with my Garmin 76cs gps system. It basically works great. I was able to make a 1500 mile round trip & find restaurants, stores, etc. At home, it is not as comprehensive as on-line yellow pages and the like; it doesn't have everything there is in it. But it is a LOT better than pulling off the road in the middle of east LA and hoping to find a bathroom!! I never got lost, even with my 13-year-old operating the gps. (It did take a few hours of playing around to get familiar with, but after that it is pretty easy to use.)"
5,A must have for your GPSMAP 76CS,I have been shopping properties and this has made my life so much easier. I just input the address and my gpsmap76cs takes me right to the front door. Well worth the price.
4,Using Garmin products,"This software has incredible potential, but can be difficult to use. It comes with the numbers to unlock all the maps, but I haven't figured out how to make it stop asking me for the unlock code every time I want to look at the maps. I love the detail it provides and am looking forward to an upcoming trip to put its incredible potential to use."
1,Not as good as old version!,"This newer Garmin City Navigator v7 DVD software is inferior to ordered older discontinued City Select v7 in too many ways to descibe. I paid a stout 100% premium for discontinued seller (greatestsale) described Garmin City Select v7 CD-ROM Map - North America and seller shipped me current Garmin City Navigator v7 DVD which I could have purchased directly from Garmin for half of what I paid seller. This newer version map segments are much too large as to be unusable on smaller screen devices. Sellers customer service # is always busy. Gee, wonder why? Buyer beware."
2,Cost Too Much,"I bought the update CD (v6 to V7) and I received it in DVD. No big problem, but when I tried to open maps they wanted another $50 to so do. Nowhere did Garmin tell me in advance they were going to charge again to open the CD (DVD) I already paid for."
1,Watch it! This is a DVD only - a CD drive won't read it.,"Neither the Garmin site nor this one make it clear that this is a DVD only. The product is not available at all on CD, and it will not install on a PC without a DVD drive. Second, you will be disappointed in this product's user interface. It is clumsy at best, and will be unuseable for some."
1,DVD vs CD Rom,Amazon can't get it right! Twice I ordered the CD-Rom version and twice they sent me the DVD version. I do not have a DVD PC. Very frustrating. Can't rate the product yet- can't load it!
4,"Saw the movie, THEN read the book","I saw the movie before I read the book. This is a typical adaptation of a long novel. Yes, the novel was better, but the novel was DIFFERENT! A similar situation occurs with The Caine Mutiny as well as The Godfather. Written stories allow you to explore aspects of character and situation that just can't be effectively portrayed in film. In film, you can't have the character's thoughts effectively presented. The film concentrated on the relationship between Will and Pearce, while the book actually had two plots-Will and Pearce and Will and Annie Kate. Instead of comparing book and film, treat each as seperate entities and enjoy them independently. In this case, the movie was enjoyable."
5,Lords of Discipline,The movie keeps one interested throughout. It is fast-paced and gets one to think about how we treat other human beings. The actors are believeable in their characters. I would highly recommend this movie.
3,A Matter of Reform,"Well intended, broke a muscle while watching those scenes of torture.With nerve I stared it in the eye. I was hopeful. In the end I felt obligated to support a certain freedom. And I do."
3,Wrong lead,"Michael Biehn should've been the lead as the director originally wanted. It was okay, but it would've been better."
3,Great Story Could've Been Better Movie,"As is true in lots of cases, the book (of which I only heard the audio version in completion) is better than the movie. Living in South Carolina, I had an intense interest in this story. I have watched the movie about 3 times, and most people probably won't do that. It took multipile viewings in order for me to like this movie. I feel that the screenwriters stole away from author Pat Conroy, by excluding the entire romance between Will McClean, and Annie Kate Gervais. David Keith does make one feel like they know him, with his down-home acting skills, and I thought that was commendable. A good mystery for a one time viewing.GOD BLESS ALL WHO READ!"
3,A wonderful book...a not quite so wonderful movie,"This movie was based on the book of the same name by Pat Conroy, which also happens to be one of my favorite books. Maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment by watching it, but I was still surprised by the large scale hacking used to cut it down to a movie. Somehow, they managed to turn the wonderfully rich character of Will into a paper thin cutout of honor and glory. Where did his grey areas go? Although it has an interesting plot and as well (but not spectacularly) acted, I spent my time wishing they could have done a better job of making this wonderful book into a movie"
2,pathetic screenplay,"I read the book and wanted to see the visual representation. If I had not read the book, I would not know about anything that was going on in the film. It was such a microcosm of the extensive tome, it should not have been made into a movie unless it was three hours. The film omitted the strong emotions that were in force at the Citadel, and it also left one to wonder why anyone would go there in the first place. Will's past and also his involvement with the pregnant girl were left out; these facts contributed to why Will was at the Citadel. Moreover, Pignetti's ""walk of shame"" ended with his simply getting into a cab. In the book, he kept on walking to the train tracks and [possible spoiler here so I will not write it]. tsk tsk...people should read the book."
3,Summer of '82,"TLoD was shot (most of the ""Carolina Military Academy"" outdoor scenes at least), at a school called Wellington College in England. A number of pupils were taken on as extras and spent most of the time getting wrecked...Which is why, in some of the ""hazing"" scenes, people cracking up laughing can be clearly seen. Sorry about that Mr Roddam, we couldn't help ourselves.It was great to see how a film gets made, and a true highlight was going to a Clash gig in Brixton that summer with those ridiculous ""Jarhead"" haircuts . Another was receiving drill instruction from a USMC drill instructor whose expression of sheer contempt, when he saw the zonked rabble he had to work with, was quite something to behold.Not much of a review, just trivia I guess, but I'd say it's worth a watch - just ignore the idiots on the edges of shot.."
2,nothing compared to the book,"Whole secens and charters that made the book good were left out, very common with movies molded after books, but the movie didnt even come close to giving the book credit for how well writen it is."
1,What a disgrace!,"The Lords of Discipline one of my favorite books. This movie is the worst portrayal of a novel I have ever seen. The movie left out the most important parts of the book (such as his relationship with Annie Kate). I knew not to expect the movie to be quite as good as the book, but I sincerely feel that I wasted my time in renting this particular movie. I think Pat Conroy would be very displeased if he saw his amazing book converted into a couple of hours worth of nonsense. Even the ending was awful. My two pieces of advice are: 1) If you have read the book, don't ruin your experience by watching the movie. And 2) If you haven't read the book, do so, but don't watch the movie. This movie was an enthusiastic two thumbs down."
3,A good movie...if you've never read the book!,"I've read this book enough times to say that the movie is nothing compared to the book. I think that anyone who sees this movie should also read the book because it was so much better. The acting was very good, but complete characters were left out! Complete and important scenes were left out and other scenes were changed around! Sad to say, this movie is a discrace to the book."
2,a beautiful torture . . .,"This is an attractive chair, fit for a king--if he has a back devoid of feeling. I have rarely sat in a less comfortable chair that LOOKED so comfortable. I am certain that others may find it ok . . . but both my husband and I found that the lower back was bereft of support, in exactly the area where it is really needed. Marvelous fabric and good construction is wasted on a very ergonomically poor design . . . a pitiful waste of good workmanship and materials."
5,Fantastic Chair,"This is one great chair, so comfortable. Great value. This product was easy to put together. It is great for anyone with back problems, hits right where it needs to. The overall product is better than I could hope for. It fits in with modern decor, or any for that matter. You can't go wrong ordering this. It was a gift to myself and I am thrilled with it. Val from Mo."
3,Mac Motion Micrfiber Recliner and ottoman,A comfortable chair. Fairly easy to assemble. I was a little disappointed to see nicks and scratches on the wood. Obviously it was previously returned merchandise. Due to the hassle of disassembling it and repacking it I did not return the chair. That's the minus side of buying furniture online. When you go to a brick and mortar store you can negotiate for a discount for damaged ware.
3,Recliner Chair,"I just received this chair. The delivery time was very prompt and after the assembly required, the chair is comfortable. However, the only complaint I have is that the ""color"" is NOT what I expected, nor it is what I ordered. It's much darker and I'm a little concerned how this will match my other furniture. I'll have to give it a few days to see if I can warm up to it or not. That is the real reason for the lower rating. As mentioned, it is comfortable."
4,"Good to sit, Hard to assemble","I waited for a month to get this, because of back order. Shop did not advise me this item is back ordered until I asked him the status. Shop behaivior is not kind one. At any rate today I received the chair and completed the assembly work somehow. Assembly work itself is not difficult, but I took one hour to comple the assembly work of ottoman. Two of four 50mm screws could not be tightened with Small wood frame. Possibly the holes depth of small wood base differ L and R. I put extra washers in one side holes and could tightened these two screws. Much higher quality control of parts is required.The sitting feel is very good. Finish of wood work and cushin is good. I found that I will be able to enjoy home theater movie confortably. Only one disadvantage is that I have to tighten firmly Side Knob after the adjustment of seat position. My wife asks me to firmly tighten each time she recline Back Cushion."
5,Blazin,"Here is a good example of good and true hip hop. Pharoahe Monch is a representation of underground hip hop,in which does not get enough recognition. His rhymes are crisp,his beats are diverse. In other words buy the whole Cd. I bet u won't be dissapointed"
5,GGGGGRRRREEEAAT little over,"The pilot lights on my old gas stove kept going out. Since waking up dead from the gas was a concern I had the old (not worth fixing and can't afford a new one)piece of junk disconnected a couple of years ago.After looking at Toaster Ovens at Wally World recently, I found this one on Amazon. It looked like a better deal for the money than anything I had seen previously so I bought it. WOW! What a great little oven. With one exception, it has done a beautiful job cooking everything I have tried. Just don't cook a pot pie in it . . . of course you would have seen where the pot pie carton said not to use a Toaster Oven before you tried it.It has been well worth the money. Amazon does it again!"
1,Another one shipped DOA,"Unbelievable, amazon keeps sending out these DOA refurbished ovens, they should read the reviews and stop selling these.About 50% of these ovens are sent out DOA, not worth the hassle.Stay away."
1,Arrived DOA,"Got it as a gift, arrived DOA also. The only thing that warmed up the oven was the light."
2,It was good while it lasted,"I bought this item in March of '08. It worked fine for about 6 months, and then the fan would run continuously until I unplugged it. Then, the fan (and everything else) would turn off by itself and I would have to unplug and plug it back in to get it to turn on. Now, 7 months after purchasing, it won't come on no matter what I do. I do not recommend this toaster."
1,Dead and deader,"Ordered this as a refurbished item, and it came DOA. So, it died from the factory, they took it back, they re-certified it, and it was DOA when they shipped it out again. Doesn't say much for the product. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is great, so it was handled. But I would think twice about spending money on one of these."
4,Yum!,"I don't think I've turned on the stove since I purchased this, I love it. However, I do have a couple of suggestions for improving this product: provide traditional ""lipped"" cookie sheets. The cookie sheets that come with the product are thin, have sharp edges and are difficult to remove from the oven when hot since they slip right over the grates. I also would include a digital keypad for changing cook times and tempertures... the up/down arrow buttons are a bit cumbersome.I love the timer. I love the convection feature. This oven does a great job of doing everything a regular oven can do.. and does it well."
4,Good for the price,I received my lil oven in perfect condition. I really like the way it cooks and it is easy to operate. I would rate it five stars except for a few factors. I didn't realize the handle is on the side and it is awkward for my space. The bottom when picking it up is sharp so be careful. I like the heaviness of the racks they stay in place really well. I do think a handgrip should have been included. I tried to find one online but wasn't able to. Even if you had to pay a little extra for the grip and the dehyhdrator but it was an option it would have made things a lot easier. Except for these minor problems I really enjoy using the oven. Makes great toast. Reheats pizza quickly.
1,OVEN doesn't work AVOID THIS REFURB,"Item arrived DOA. The convection fan would not work. Apparently, AMAZON doesn't bother to actually refurbish defective merchandise before reselling it."
1,"Weak, poor quality, not easily attached","I bought this stupidly thinking it was nylon. It is not. It is thin wisps of plastic melted together in squares. It can really only easily be applied with a staple gun so if your trellis is made of pipe like mine is, it is very difficult to attach it. I put pressure on the squares to see what is needed to break them and it didn't take much. This is not worth buying even if it's the cheapest trellis you can find."
2,vegatable garden netting,"I received a refund for this product; one of the most important dimensions, netting square size, was only 2""x 2"" and too small for vertical growing of plants with large leaves like cucumbers, beans, and squash. Unfortunately this dimension was not listed in the product description."
4,The lord of the rings; the battle of middle earth,The battles are like real and you can control large amounts of people. The game is very fun.They should make more of these games.
1,FULL OF BUGS..WON'T LAUNCH,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME. EA Games really botched things up on this one. Look at the game forums..they're rife with people who bought the game yet can't play it because of EA Games' copy protection bug. I bought the game for my son. I don't copy software or pirate anything. A notorius ""game.dat"" error will pop up on your screen after you successfully install the game. There isn't a fix under the sun that will correct the problem. Forget getting EA Games to help. They're customer support is non-existent. I've heard they don't plan on resolving the issue. Buyer beware. Check out the game forums and search for ""game.dat""."
5,An incredible Album……,"It is hard to believe no one made a critic of this lonely work of art… This is an exceptional piece where Lee Morgan’s trumpet perfectly blends with Wayne Shorter’s sax…Bobby, Timmons is incredible…Especially in “Johnny’s blue”…It’s definitely on my top 20 list of jazz masterpieces."
5,radio stinks,"I say that because you will never hear this excellent gem of an album on commercial radio. Actually, radio has sucked since the late 80's. Since this is not a review of radio all I can say is follow amazon's reviews by fellow music lovers and trust them. Buy this album and then try Under The Covers with Suzanne Hoffs. And please turn off your radio as it is filled with what the music industry wants you to hear, not this great stuff."
4,Holds up well,"Released almost 10 years ago, and this CD still contains more relevance than any of today's alternative crap (as if ""alternative"" really means anything anymore). The songs do get a bit repetitive, but I can handle it."
5,One of my top 5 favorite CDs of all time!,I had originally bought this CD in 1991. I had to buy it again because I wore it out!! I am glad that this album is getting the recognition that it has -- it is well deserved!
5,One of the best albums of the 1990s,"I played this album over and over after I first heard it, constantly thinking ""I cannot believe this is as good as it is."" (Most of us had never heard of Sweet until Girlfriend.) There is nothing massively inventive, no virtuoso instrumental performances--just song after song after song of honest lyrics, great hooks, intense guitar licks, and beautiful harmonies. A must-have."
3,Hate to break the 5-star streak but...,"Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs on this album. Sweet's feelgood pop riffs sound great for a few songs, but become tedious during the entire 15 song length of this CD. I like Matthew Sweet...in moderation."
2,Give up the ghost.,"I listened to this cd after reading several reviews on Pitchfork that disparaged Oasis. To wit: ""Matthew Sweet is the regenerate Beatles imitator truly worthy of our affection."" Hardly. This lo-fi recording is nothing like Oasis, nothing like the ""Revolver"" or ""Rubber Soul""-era imitators from the UK I've come to enjoy. Maybe a stab at at later era? Who knows. Christopher Cross? R.E.M.? More likely. In any case, this stuff is tail-end 80s ""alternative."" Other bands (that still grasp the new melodic revolution, like Blink and Soundtrack of Our Lives) snatched up the term, much to the disgust of leftover 80s-philes who now give thumbs down to anything that doesn't remind them of their halcyon college radio days. Pitchfork and co., hubristic reviewers all: get over it. As for the casual reader, do yourself a favor and pick up anything by Canadian band Sloan. Even Teenage Fanclub is better than this."
5,Pop never rocked so sweet,"This album is excellent. Matthew Sweet has an amazing ability to write seemingly simple songs and then record and perform them in such a way that they are almost unrecognisable. Many of the songs on this album feature ""dueling riffs"", that is there are two different lead guitar parts going on through most of the song. This feature can't really be appreciated until you hear it through headphones where the complexity of both parts can be fully appreciated. I've never heard anyone else who can transform simplicity into such intertwining compositions and still maintain that essential pop groove. The only down side to this record is the fact that the bonus tracks don't quite fit the rest of the album, but I'm not complaining, it just makes me want more!"
4,Excellent Bouquet with a twist of sanity.,"Entertaining, thought provoking and a ""mind stir"". Excellent independent film! Would be a better world with more films like this."
1,"Obscure logical system, that complicates logic.","This book is a logical primer for use with a teacher. If the teacher is inadequate, the understanding of logic is as well. Also, the system is overly complicated, and the long established rules have been thrown out, and replaced by new versions, with new names. Learning by this system will likely cause students to be stymied by more advanced logical pursuits that are based on traditional logic systems, as they will have to learn the traditional system anyway. For this reason, Lemmon's logical system is suitable only as an example of how NOT to teach logic."
4,arrived quickly,"the book arrived quickly, but i wouldn't say this textbook is good at explaining things. it's alright. has answers in the back for most problems."
3,'Spaceships with Fins' Fiction,"Quirky retro sci-fi. Time travel, robots, monsters, insane-brain-aliens, and moments that you gotta love, like in the first chapter where two reporters are flying around in a rocket ship, smoking pipes, and typing on their ""spacewriter"". Stephen King give it a nod in his ""About Writing,"" and it was a fun easy read. I enjoyed imagining all the props and people as being snatched out of the 60's, like some meandering episode of the original Outer Limits series. Surprisingly, the science isn't too naive for being written in 1967(?). Worth picking up if you can find a copy."
4,A Science Fiction Master Writer,"Clifford D. Simak is a master sf writer. Cosmic Engineers, a ""333"" classic work, now shows its age, but remains a great adventure. You'll enjoy it, I am sure."
3,The Return of the Prodigal Stranger,"From 1991, The Prodigal Stranger was a comeback, of sorts, following a fourteen year gap wherein Procol Harum's driving force Gary Brooker recorded three solo albums. Members of the group's original line-up including Brooker, guitarist Robin Trower, and organist Matthew Fisher all appear in songs ranging from very fine to very derivative, bathed in a dated, large '80s sound. Brooker sounds as good as ever, Fisher adds some nice organ backing and signatures, and Trower is mostly invisible. Sorely missing is the late B.J. Wilson's singular drumming. The album was seemingly welcomed by fans and few else. I welcomed it fondly at the time, but find myself returning to it less and less."
5,Durham County,"Durham County is Great has great actors like Hugh Dillon who has such great talent he puts his heart and soul in his caracater Mike Sweeney. All the other stars do so good also. The story in both vol. 1 & 2 will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see more. It is well worth every penny you pay. Now I can hardly wait for season 3 to come out on DVD. Hats over to Hugh and the directors, producers and writer great job."
5,A Underrated Series...But When is Season 3 DVD Release Date? Anyone?,"Durham County is not perfect and there are some flaws in the storyline and from what I hear the production of this series. However there is far more good things than bad about this show. The series is dark and places one at the edge. It'll keep you guessing and is shot/cinematography is nothing short of brilliant. The actors standout and can be appreciated through proper character development and a good storyline. The series reminds me of a poor man's version of Dexter but not that poor. Like Dexter, it's creepy, well written and not very predictable. So help me out anyone...when is Durham County 3 going to be released in DVD format? I can't get any info anywhere."
5,I can't get enough of this show,"Despite changing actors for one of the most important roles from Season 1, Durham County Season 2 manages to stay compelling entertainment. With the introduction of the great Michelle Forbes as a psychologist with just a few 'issues' of her own, the story propels forward as Ray Prager goes to trial for his crimes and Mike Sweeney's daughter is the star witness against him. More 'secrets' about all the main characters are revealed here and the jaw dropping actions of all concerned continues to make for a riveting series. If you haven't come across this show I recommend purchasing it as it may be hard to find and its a cut above most other shows currently on TV in my view."
2,Boring,"Micheal Keaton's performance is addequate , but it's way too long for what it is and the plot is sloooooooooooooooooooooooow and pretty boring ."
1,Too difficult,I like the premise behind the game. Move objects to help the penguins reach their destination. However actually completing the tasks proved more difficult than it should have been. Not a game for young children at all.
1,T509 Car Charger,"Item arrived as promised - unfortunately, although the plug looks close to how it should, it does not fit into the phone and thus is useless. Given the price, it is hardly worth the hassle of returning it. Thus, if you are looking for a car charger for the Samsung T-509, this will NOT work."
1,Club heads broke off,I order this set of golf clubs. They were fine however the last two times my son used them the heads to three of the irons broke off.
1,Cheap clubs,I am sorry I bought these clubs for my son. We have them a week now. The second time on the driving range the three wood head broke off. This is on a grass range NOT OFF A MAT!!! I will now try to get my money back. Wish me luck.I rate them with one star because there is nothing lower.
1,Warmed-over Santana with lousy vocals,"Not a whit of musical growth in this trifle of a pop song. I hate to say it, because I do love the Santana of the 70s.... And Rob Smith's vocals are so mannered and amateurish that I find the song irritating. A huge disappointment."
5,An amazing combination of old and new!,"Well, it's completely and totally obvious that Carlos Santana is an amazing classic rock god, but to combine him with a recently chart-topping voice like Rob's is total genius. I am not a huge fan of Matchbox 20 in general (though ""Push"" did help me lose some pent-up anger and grudges during the Summer of '97), but Rob Thomas' voice is as gritty and sexy as anything, especially combined with Santana's easily recognizable guitar style. The lyrics are those of a frustrated and hurt love victim, which is enough for me to say you (yes, YOU) should go grab this single, or the entire CD, b/c one day we all will (or have been) a frustrated victim of the thing called love, and the VOICE and the GUITAR will take you away.............:)"
5,Song of the year,"I have hated all of Matchbox 20's released songs and I was appalled when my little sister bought their CD. I was all ready to hate this song when I found out Rob Thomas was singing, but I just couldn't do it. Even with the annoying amount of times you hear this song on VH1, MTV and radio, I can't get enough. This is definetly the best single that has been released this year."
5,Excellent Song,"I hadn't heard Santana in years, But am extremely happy that they have become popular again. I really like Rob Thomas, I had never heard of him before this and am sorry that I hadn't, But now I know. I am looking forward to hearing more of him."
5,Great Book,Easy to read an informative. Am using it in a large study group.Has alot of information that is useful.
4,lightbox well made,"The lightbox is constructed very well and is just the right size for my studio needs (I'm an artist, but not a photographer). Good quality for the money."
4,Excellent interpretation of lieder,"Janowitz's renditions of many of these famous songs is superb but subtle. 'Dei Lorelei' is one of my favorite Germen poems and songs, and the version here is one of the best I've ever heard. Every song on here is a masterwork, both in selection and vocal interpretation. Yet, I had to dock one star for the somewhat poor sound quality, as there is faint hissing throughout the recording. Still a great musical disc."
2,Poor sound quality and Gundula not at her best,"When I read the glowing reviews others have given this disc, I wonder if we're listening to the same recording. Gundula Janowitz is far and away my favorite singer of lieder. Her voice is remarkable for its clear and even tone; although she doesn't have the power of Te Kanawa, say, she makes up for it with the beauty of her interpretation and sound. But this disc is terrible. It sounds like someone's niece's recital. The piano is lugubrious (very unusual for Irwin Gage, who is normally a sensitive accompanist for Janowitz), and Janowitz's voice is too far back. Rather than this disc, buy Janowitz's rendition of Strauss' Four Last Songs with Karajan; Tod and Verklarung on the same disc is also divine. Or you can buy the two CD set of Janowitz singing Schubert, on which you'll hear how beautifully Janowitz sings lieder and how well Gage accompanies her."
4,Great way to priserve your photos,"We had lotz of odd sized photos mainly from Picture People. It was really hard to find photo book for those.Pioneer Jumbo Magnetic Page X-Pando Album, is a great way to store and save the photos. It makes photos look good too."
5,Pioneer jumbo magnetic photo album,"The Pioneer X-Pando magnetic photo album holds many photos per page, with ample room for elaborate captions, if desired. The magnetic page-covers allow complete freedom to arrange your displays as you wish. Refill pages and a brass custom-engraved plaque for the cover are very reasonable when ordered by mail from Pioneer. A giant, heavy album for special projects!"
4,Not really infinitely X-Pando album - but it can be arranged,"I have been using these particular photo albums for 12 years and am generally very pleased with how well they preserve photos. The major problem is that when more pages are added, the covers tear away due to added weight and stress. I have recently discovered that putting metal washers under the screw pegs substantially increases the durability of the album. They are not, I repeat, not infinitely expandable as has been implied by the manufacturer in the past, but they can be expanded safely with the additional reinforcement afforded by metal washers.Otherwise, these are the best hobby-level albums I've used. I've tried a lot of albums.Janet Arrowsmith-Lowe"
1,BAD!,"Please don't buy magnetic photo albums! I have one just like this, and my pictures are already starting to ruin. I found out that the acid and lignin in these albums will discolor and eventually eat through your photos. With all of the $$$ spent on cameras, film, and developing PLEASE invest in a safer way to store and display them!!! Try a Creative Memories album. I like them the best! They cost a little more, but a well worth it in the long run!"
3,Low capacity,"After the initial excitment, I have started to dislike this album. Because it only has 10 pages (20 sides), it took just me three weeks to fill it up. Then I had to buy more fillings (which is available from ...). five pages of filling cost 7 dollars, it's expensive. Especially considering its awkward design, I don't like it much. Pick up something that uses soft sheets and has cheap fillings."
1,BAD,"The glossy covers have started gatting small white spots all over the pictures, and I have only used it for no more than 6 Month. BAD QUALITY, don't buy!!!"
5,Great Mic for the price,"This is a great selection for the price, and even more.You could get a great sound with it"
3,"Supertramp - 'Live, 1997' (EMI Gold) 3 1/2 stars","Obviously recorded during their 1997 tour. I'm giving this live Supertramp CD a 3 1/2 star rating because I thought they managed to play enough older material to make this disc a semi-keeper. Tunes that make CD worth checking out are ""Free As A Bird"", the emotional ""From Now On"", ""Breakfast In America"", the memorable ""Take The Long Way Home"" (great harmonica work), ""Bloody Well Right"", ""The Logical Song"" and one of my favorites ""School"". Line-up: original member Rick Davies-keyboards, piano, harmonica & vocals, long-time member John Helliwell (since 1973)-sax & woodwinds, Mark Hart-guitar & vocals, Carl Verheyen-guitar, Cliff Hugo-bass and Bob Siebenberg-drums. I know it's EASIER said than done, but they REALLY need to get founder Roger Hodgson back in the group."
2,not that great,You know i hear people say how great the virus are. FOLLY!!!!FOLLY!!!!!Lets dress hardcore and make songs that sound like rancid thats really cool. Who would want to sound like tim armsrongs no talent ass clown band anyways? If you want to listen to hardcore bands that dont suck on punk core records than listen to the vraukers or clt 45.
2,"Scary- Try ""In The Womb"" instead...","My husband and I both agree this movie was very scary- especially having our first child. Also, the technology they talk so highly of in the beginning wasn't used as much as it should have been. They focused on the lives of the 9 women far too much instead of focusing on the title of the movie- Conception to Birth.If you are looking for a good movie with 3D/4D animations and images, try National Geographic's ""In the Womb"". It is wonderful and extremley informative. It truly portrays the miracle of life that a baby is."
2,Outdated,"This video is outdated for anyone who is interested in seeing a variety of birth options.The most helpful parts were the viewings of the developing fetus while the moms were ""doing their lives"" daily. To me this gave a real sense of life growing while mom's life was happening. I was disappointed in the actual birth scenes since all moms were lying on their backs in hospital beds, often being offered various interventions to ""help"" with pain."
5,Good Book,A good book for those wanting to get beyond the beginner stages. Bought this one for my daughter for Christmas and she's been having a blast making various objects she gives to her friends as little thinking of you gifts.
3,Needs some work,"This book is an excellent source of patterns for boxes but could be better organized and more user-friendly. I am slowly working my way through it and annotating the directions. Recommendations on paper would be useful. For example, the Triangle Box is best made from two-sided paper as the back of the paper is visible. I made the Octagon box out of standard 6' paper and found it too floppy. It worked much better with a stiffer paper cut down to 4"". Are the other Tomoko Fuse box books more detailed? I have done a lot of modular origami and found the quality of directions varies widely from book to book."
4,just OK,"the book wasnt in great conditions but for the price i paid it was very acceptable, this was a gift for one of my friends and she loved it"
3,Nice Lens,"Canon's 28-105 lens is nice. It borders on great, but doesn't quite make it. First, the good stuff. Optically, the lens performs well. It is sharp, and maintains contrast well, particularly when used with a hood. The full-time-manual USM focusing is perhaps the best feature of the lens, which allows the user to manually adjust the focusing without having to flip a switch. The lens does have an autofocus/manual focus switch for completley disabling autofocus, though. The zoom range is convenient for general use. Now, let's talk about some of the drawbacks. The aperture range (f3.5 to f4.5) is somewhat limiting for lower-light photography, and for portraiture when you want to throw the background out of focus. The lens does exhibit barrel distortion. The body construction doesn't feel quite as sturdy as some of Canon's other lenses. Overall, the lens is a pretty good compromise of quality, price, focal range, performance, and optics."
3,Older model..but OK still,"This was the model with the ""rose"" icon. So the first version they made. Still works fine and the optics are excellent"
5,A great lens,Perfectly fit to any SLR Canon cameras..... With the wide range of zoom at the great focus limit at 3.5 to 4.5.... Great!
3,Really repetitive,"After reading the other reviews, this book was a disappointing read. It would make an interesting magazine article, but I think that it drags on- even for a short (141 page) book. I found myself zoning out while reading, it didn't capture my attention past the first few pages.I highly suggest that you read the sample pages, and imagine it being repeated about 50 times.The message is good, I loved the stories from his friends, but expected a lot more."
1,Review of the Tao of the Ride,"If you like words of wisdom like ""my motorcycle is my monastery"" then this book is for you. For the rest of us, just forget it.The stories by other motorcyclists at the end of the book were generally interesting, but not worth the purchase of the book."
3,Almost there,"Garripoli was on the right track with this book. He made a few good connections between man and the machine. Nice try, but not great. I'll keep searching for the one that can really put the emotions and feelings into the appropriate words."
2,Not good,"The writer spews out Zen/Tao cliches, than tries to make some relationship with his love for motorcycles. Unfortunately he doesn't pull it off."
3,Author gets it.,"Like most books on the Tao this one can be a little dry. That said, the author has a solid grasp on the relationship many riders have with the ride itself. He relates on an everyperson level the relationship of the Tao, riding and being at peace with yourself and those around you. Nearly half the book is testimonials from his friends about riding and that sort of spoiled the last half for me.An ok read overall, definitly relevant."
1,A real stinker!,"If you believe that the frequency of a Harley at idle is in tune with your alpha rythms and the rythm of the earth, if you can't stand words of more than 3 syllables, if you think Harley is a synonym for motorcycle, this book may be for you.A narcissistic exploration of new age mysticism by a fellow who seems to know little about anything, including the bare rudiments of how to care for his bike. Fifteen years ago he would have posed in a leisure suit with gold chains. Now the cover photo shows an earnest searching looking fellow on the back of a Harley with the obligatory tatoos.Lao Tzu must be rolling over in his grave!"
5,Nice - enjoyable read,"I read this as soon as it arrived....only took a few hours. No tough reading, just an enjoyable winters read, while wishing you could be riding."
4,Saddlebag Worthy,"This book offers a new slant on some Daoist principles for living, but you should probably be a biker to fully appreciate his descriptions and metaphors. I would've packaged the book a bit different and left out the short stories from Garri's friends, but hey, it still has a great message on finding your path and he offers us some real quotable gems of wisdom. It's short and I like that - just the right size for a weekend solo ride. Worth the money."
1,The Tao of the Ride: Motorcycles and the Mechanics of the Soul,"As a fellow motorcycles, I applaud Garripoli for his tenacity as a rider and the effort he put forward to write and publish his book. However, his book has little or no insights to offer motorcyclists. His stories, while well reported, are poorly written and are the type of tales you tell over a bottle of beer to a friend with a sympathic ear."
3,Only Billy Bob,"It is not hard to imagine why it took so long for this movie to be released. It's not very good and the story has nothing new or worthwile about it. There must have been more stories about couples sleeping with the other in the other couple. Billy Bob Thornton is worth seeing in this movie, playing a second-hand car dealer. Charlize Theron isn't bad as Patrick Swayze's wife. It is rather fun hearing Swayze talk with a southern accent. If you have too much money or a Billy-Bob obsession you can get it, but I would what until it's on television."
4,An overlooked comedy with a great cast,"Slowly working my way through every Billy Bob Thorton film, I came across this sleeper of a comedy. For what it sets out to be, it succeeds wildly, and I recommend this to anyone who likes comedies with a slightly darker twist. It's not earth-shattering, but the acting is terrific, and there are plenty of laughs. Billy Bob Thornton stars as the lovably gruff, stick-his-foot-in-his-mouth sleazy car salesman Lonnie Earl Dodge. He has some great lines at inappropriate times. The other male lead is Patrick Swayze, playing the handsome but rather slow and doofy husband of Charlize Theron. At the major climax of the action, when Billy Bob's and Charlize's philandering is revealed to their spouses, everyone in the room is fighting, but Swayze just ""doesn't get it"" and completely missed the secret which was revealed. The ending of the movie is absolutely fantastic, and all the loose ends of this foursome's lives get tied up nicely. Give this one a shot!"
4,hilarious and entertaining,"I ordered Waking up in Reno and absolutely loved it. I caught a portion of it on tv and just had to order one for myself.First copy was lost in mail but Amazon rushed me one in 2 days at no extra charg. I was very satisfied with the movie and Amazon.Vicki C, Tulsa"
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #010,"Best:1) Much of the redneck dialogue was absolutely hilarious. Some scenes should give any viewer a belly laugh or two.2) It was wacky and upbeat enough to hold your attention throughout.3) There are a decent amount of special features including funny director/writer commentaries.Worst:1) The sexy scenes weren't all that racy. We get to see Charlize in her underwear and later splashing about in a swimming pool, but that's about it.Recommendation:If you like your laughs big, fat and dumb, then you'll probably like this one. There were a few good one-liners that gives this one rewatch value for some. The sex scenes, however, are nothing but tease and may leave you frustrated. Consider paying retail for this one ONLY if you're really into redneck humor and/or Billy Bob Thornton - otherwise get it used for half price or less."
5,Hilarious!,"I just caught this movie on Starz, and even though I'm not usually into ""Billy Bob"" movies, I was totally sucked in after the first few minutes. What I thought was neat is that the ""rednecks"" in this movie weren't entirely stereotypical...as a matter of fact in my opinion they were pretty much on target. I know a handful of people in my neck of the woods who look/act/talk the exact same way. My favorite part of the movie is when the foursome finally get to Reno and the two women are running around their awesome hotel suite, dancing to a Shania Twain video on the leather couch. Just for the record, Patrick Swayze looks just as good today as he did nearly 20 years ago in Grandview USA. Yum! His character was a perfect match for Charlize Theron's slightly dumb, slightly slutty but still sweet Candy...who was a good enough friend to ""Darlene"" to sleep with her husband. Don't miss this one if you get the chance!"
3,Racy comedy,"I can't say this was one of my favorite Patrick Swayze movies. I definitely loved him in this, but didn't like the moral vibes in the movie. Just a bit of a gutter ride."
4,Lots of fun,"This book is adoreable and great for anyone over age 4. When I read it with my son I realized that he doesn't know his fairy tales and nursery rhymes very well, so some of it was lost on him, but it was still a fun read. He loved pulling out the letters and discovering what surprises were inside."
5,We love this book!,What a great book! Lots of play on fairytale characters. The book has 'envelopes' with really fun items to discover stuffed inside on each page. I enjoyed exploring this book as much as my son did.
5,A Must Own for a Children's Book Collection,"My sister and I had this book back in the 90's, and they have since made it (and the original Jolly Postman book) slightly larger. I kind of liked the smaller version because it was so intimate. I can see why they made it bigger. And I am so happy it is still in print. My children (daughters 2 and 4) just love it, but any one of any age would. The rhyming text is charming, the details spectacular, and the quality of the book very nice. I do supervise whenever my kids look at it so they don't rip it or lose anything. Every other page is a full-page envelope with a pouch containing a fun Christmas card or game that is a take on a classic nursery tale. This book won't ever get old and is a perfect Christmas gift or addition to your Christmas story book collection. And definitely get the original Jolly Postman book as well."
5,christmas book,"Wonderful book I purchased for my grandson. My choldren had this book years ago and loved it, so I purchased it for a christmas present again"
4,Heart-Warming Love Story with Emphasis on Family,"Aishwarya Rai knows how to pick her movies. She does a brilliant job in every single one of them. Kuch Na Kaho is no different. There's plenty of charm, heart-warming moments, heart-breaking moments and several light, but romantic interludes. Not as romantically oriented as ""Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam"", but defintely a great story about love in modern India.At his mother's request, Raj begrudginly goes to India for his cousin's wedding only to be pressured by his uncle to find a bride. His uncle orders his favorite and very lovely employee, Namrata, to do the match-making. Neither of the two are thrilled about the idea, but over time Raj falls deeply in love with her. However, Namrata holds back because of some baggage in her past that eventually comes back to haunt the both of them.The plot is enjoyable and you can't really see which way it'll end until the very last moment. As always, great musical numbers. Definitely worth the watch."
4,"Wonderful, fluffy entertainment","Raj is supposed to get married and falls in love with the woman that functioned as his matchmaker. She loves him, too, but has a secret that threatens to ruin their new found relationship.I was rooting for them, too, but until the very end I was not sure how it would turn out, given the strong emphasize on marriage, family and sacrifice.This is definitely up to par with most of what Hollywood churns out these days. The production values are outstanding and Rai is just gorgeous. This is one of the most, if not the most, beautiful woman on any silver screen. Loved the costumes, the locales... No foul language, absolutely nothing inappropriate is going on (at least that we can see). This is maybe my third ""Bollywood"" movie and I am actually surprised the PTC has not discovered them for family viewing.Check it out to see if the genre, the subtitles and the long musical interludes are something you can live with. Maybe you'll become a believer. Escapist fare at it's best."
5,my favorite,"I love this movie. It's one of the first Bollywood movies I watched and I just fell in love with it. I enjoy the dancing and music in this movie. Aishwarya and Abhishek are perfect together. When I want to introduce people to Bollywood I have them watch this and they genuinely like it, even guys. Bollywood movies are long, like 3 hours. If your like me, you can drag out the movie for 4 or 5 days and pretend it's a mini novella. Same style as Mexican novellas. I would recommend this movie to someone unsure of what these movies are like, because this one is sooooo good."
3,"Its good, I expected more blues","They are both great and they are recognized masters by almost all blues fans. Why did they put out a blues-rock album? I dont mind if Clapton puts out an album with rock songs like Marry you, riding w the king, I wanna be, but why have BB in there too? This album could have been a lot better if they had deleted those rock songs and add more BLUES. Still, its highly recommended for anyone who wants a taste of the blues in their collection, but if you have follow these guys careers in the blues, you are left wanting something more out of this album"
5,blues gets the treatment by two legends,"this is a powerhouse double effort by Eric Clapton and B.B. King, as they examine blues classics that BB often played when he was younger. The results kick butt, because you have the double guitar attack which makes for a fine groove. BB and Eric made great music by themselves, and putting them together releases some very wonderful work. I highly recommend this to any fans of the blues, or of either of these musicians. It is a terrific piece of swaggering blues, music with a true blues groove."
4,a decent album,"I have been a huge Eric Clapton and B.B. King fan for years. When this album came out, I listened to it right away. The feeling created by this album is more of a laid back blues style rather than up tempo blues. Also, the majority of the songs are B.B. King songs, so if you are a fan of Eric Clapton and not B.B. King, then I really don't recommend that you purchase this album."
4,Interesting mix between Rock and Blues,"This CD is an interesting mix between today's contemporary Rock Music (Clapton) and the Blues (King). It demonstrates that music, what ever type, can come together into a harmonious blend of sound, tempo, and style. I received it for my b-day a few days ago and have virtually played it over and over again in order to try to capture the full essence and quality of these two masters of music coming together."
5,Blues Brothers,"Excellent CD. I got a lump in my throat listening to this in my car for the first time. If B.B. dominates this album its because he's the best. BTW, I can't think of anyone I'd rather see him team up with than E.C. This CD is a must have for any true music lover."
3,A little too polished,"This album is generally good, but when you compare it to Live at the Regal, or John Lee Hooker's the Healer, its not even in the same league. BB King's older music is by far his most powerful, because it is less polished and produced and more raw. This is too commercial for my taste."
5,Play It Over and Over!,"I took a chance and ordered it ""unheard"" and don't regret this purchase at all. This is a great addition to my collection of modern blues which I share with the listening audience every week via community radio. Today's show featured several cuts from this cd and others by both artists. The show evoked more enthusiastic feedback from listeners than any other show in the 12 years I've been doing radio. And I can't stop listening to it at home, in the car, to wake up to. BB and Eric work together, and obviously enjoy making music, without tripping over egos. My favorites -- ""Riding with the King"" and ""Hold On, I'm Coming"" take both classic songs to new heights. Truly a collector's item -- buy it now!"
3,Didn't meet my expectations,I guess it just didn't meet up with my expectations. I had expected hard-jammin-swing-from-the-ceiling-bust-out-the-windows blues BUT this is decidedly mellow. Still. Pretty good. How could it not be?
4,Very good but not great,"This is an excellent cd but not the best playing from either ofthe stars.While Amazon offers a good price for this, the retail list price on this one is not justified - not many cd's would be worth that ridiculous price. Anyway, go in with a friend an get this and you will enjoy some good to great playing, but don't expect the wonders that some reviewers claim to hear from this cd."
4,BB King & Clapton-- Winning Combination,This BB King/Eric Clapton partnership created a great album- Riding With the King. It has a great modern blues sound. It is not possible to expect anything but good from these two masters. I hope they will record more albums like this in the near future.
2,This albulm blows - both artist should be sent back to blues,"camp. This CD is like a bloated corporate blues primer for AOLers. Weak, weak and weak. An embarrassment to both legendary blues stars.I sold it within one listen!"
3,Good but not very inspiring,"Some good tracks, some pedestrian tracks. Nothing very original but guess they enjoyed doing it."
3,Riding With the King- Eric Clapton and B.B. King,"The Album Riding With the King has some really fantastic blues songs but is lacking the elements that would make this album worth buying. The 12 songs are all repetative and dull; they should have put some classic blues songs like ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman"". You would think two notorious classic blues guitar artists would collaborate to make a better album. Spend the extra money and buy Eric Claptons live album ""One More Car, One More Rider"", its worth the money.This album definatly didnt meet my expectations. But what do you expect from a guy who refuses to play chords."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"I didn't think I could go wrong with two of my favorite artists on one album, but the songs are so overlly commercialized that they have a very little trace left of the stuff that made the King the King and Clapton Clapton. The title track is the worst offender of all of the songs. I was truly disappointed."
3,Good for chill'in not really groov'in,Great compilation of relaxing blues toons. Unfortunately relaxing is all you'll get here. I would have enjoyed it a little more if it had included a couple of toons that had made me want to get up and move a little though.
5,Experience sounds good,"These two artists sound great together. It bought this cd the day it came out and i love it. I listened to it straight through and can saftly say that the experience betwen these two artists sounds great. I love their music as solo artists, but i can also say it sounds just as good when they put their guitar playing abilities together. This album is worth it."
5,Critique Riding With The King,This is definetly the two Kings of the Blues. They are the best Blues artists around today. I will purchase this CD without even hearing any more than the sample and will be sure that it will be great. B.B. and Eric together how could you go wrong.
2,Very disappointing,"Most songs on this CD are rather good, especially those which are sung solely by B.B. King. Real blues songs are songs where melancholy and the struggle with life are eminent and B.B. King is one of the best performers in the genre. Eric Clapton is a most exquisite guitarist, but I am sorry to say it, he can't sing (at least not the blues). In the songs on which he features next to B.B. King the magic of the blues is gone and annoyance and anger take their place. The final track Come rain or come shine is a pinnacle of musical poverty.Moreover, the sound quality of this record is rather poor. All instruments are taken on one line, there is hardly any subtlety, there's no stage, the voices are explicitely coming from the right or from the left, the songs where the voice of B.B. King is nicely centered are rare."
5,Clapton and King Together at Last!,"Great CD! Cant recommend it more! If youre any type of fan, whether new or old, you will enjoy this cd! Clapton and King at their very best! Go out and buy it now!"
2,"A lot of schlock, a few good numbers","This CD was a huge disappointment to me as I was really expecting something great. Instead, this is really a very middling effort for these two masters. Some of the tunes (Marry You sticks out like a sore thumb) are downright hard to listen to. Of course there a few good numbers on here, but on the whole this is a very disappointing effort."
2,Not for me,"I have been a follower of Clapton for years but this is the first album that I did not take to immediately - in fact I still have not taken to it after a number of playings. I will be dropping this disc off at the local charity shop, and will not even burn one of the tracks onto my own CD compilation before it goes ..."
4,Fine work by two kings.,"Like many others, I was skeptical when this was first released. B.B. is the undisputed King of the Blues, and I wondered how well he and Eric Clapton would mesh. But then, I heard ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" on the radio, and I was hooked (some times, I think it is impossible for someone to do a bad job with this song).The title, ""Riding With the King"" kinda lets us know who is the Boss here. Clapton and B.B. both did themselves proud with this album, though. There is more than enough to make this a worthwhile purchase. The instrumental work between them is the best, and their two distinctive styles mesh well together. However, Slow Hands cannot hang when it comes to the vocal aspect of the Blues, and is a tad short in some blues classics.They positively burn down the house with their rendition of the Isaac Hayes/David Porter classic ""Hold On, I'm Coming"". That alone makes this worth the price of a ticket to ride. This is a fine fine disc."
5,Two of the best play together for a great album,"This CD was one of the wisest purchases I have ever made in my entire life. If one looks for guitar in an album, look no farther for this is the top of the line. If fans of either BB King or Eric Clapton want a great CD this is a wise purchase."
2,"Yeah, they're 2 stars, but...","58 rhapsodizing reviews...What I can I say--both of these guys have better albums individually, and other than their status, this is far from the most *interesting* blues music being put out today. Look at the covershot, everything about the packaging...slick car, slick suits, the most expensive guitars available. These guys started in the blues, but their music has transcended to something else.No hard feelings, but I don't think it's that great, either. Give me a new Fat Possum release over this , anyday. I want raw, and I want emotion. BB's voice indeed still carries that, but the playing is so uptown, and Clapton is NOT in blues mode, he's still stuck in Babyface/cross-over crooning.Buy a poster if you can get one; this disc will be forgettable as soon as all the cloying fawning has passed."
3,Blues in the Modern Age...,"While the songwriting, playing, and production on this record are impeccable, there is something missing... soul. Where is the grit of some intense playing on this record? I know that B.B. King AND Eric Clapton can really play and sweat, but this record sounds as if they we're sitting back in the studio and spouting out a record with the least amount of grease as possible.Otherwise a fairly good record."
4,Good Ride,"King & Clapton have produced an enjoyable CD with a better than average songlist. These two guitar masters weave together some delicious riffs on this project. BB still has his chops, Clapton is on top of his game, and they seem to enjoy the collaboration. Essential for any blues collection."
3,An argument for Napster?,"Much of this collection sounds phoned in. It's slick and perfunctory, not the gritty, impassioned stuff we want from these two masters. Beyond that, this album bears all the annoying production hallmarks that are driving listeners to Napster, MP3 and the like: track 1 is a throw-away designed for radio release. I usually start this CD at track 4, skipping 2 and 3 entirely (they're boring). None of the tunes exceeds 6 minutes, and most are faded out around the pop-format 4 minutes in length, right about the time that B.B. or Clapton (or both) start getting into the kind of groove you want to hear MORE of! Coming on the heels of a recently released Albert KIng and Stevie Ray Vaughn collaboration, which had long, inspired, wonderfully satisfying 12-minute jams, this album just teases. I skip the last track too. It's a great classic song but an unwelcome oddity here."
5,close your mouth before something flies in,"Yes, indeed. 12 tracks of absolutely jaw dropping proof that age means nothing for the true guitar gods. This music goes STRAIGHT past your ears and to your heart and hips. Amazing."
5,It's too good.,The CD is just too good. I end up not listening to other great music. BB and E.C. together on this album are just addicting!
1,Forget About Eric and BB -- Andy Fairweather Low is God!,"Ok you adult contemporary types, go ahead and rebuke my review, but you didn't really need it in the first place because you are not interested in objectivity; you are interested in agreeing with the opinions that you have already formed. (Yeah, yeah, you Oprah and Martha Stewart loving types--you would only know the blues if you were critically short of breath!) ""Riding with the King"" is a sad attempt at the blues, due to Eric and BB's feeble efforts. The album is only the best blues album in history because it features the songwriting of Doyle Bramhall and the real guitar genius of Andy Fairweather Low! They tear the roof off the joint! Buy this album from Amazon now!"
1,Clapton doesn't understand the blues,"Clapton's ""whitewashed"" version od the blues just pales in compariosn with BB's soulful meaningful and powerful blues. If we could only edit out all of Clapton's parts thsi would be a great date. Too bad they didn't match BB with John Lee Hooker instead, he was still around back then. Oh well..."
1,So what?,"Riding with the King.... Yes, and not listening to what I'm doing. Why the hell didn't these two call it: Earning money without work? Two names, making you believe in big things to come. But, no way. It's only two old men and a lack of new ideas. We all know that Clapton is not god anymore and B.B. King will not be the one re-inventing the blues. But we love them for what they are. But there was really no need for this CD. I can only say that I wish I kept my money."
1,Depressing,"I would have thought that two titans of the business such as Clapton and King could produce an amazing album without even trying. I was wrong. This album makes me think of two old geezers glued to their rocking chairs trying to recall the good old days but not even having the energy to take their memories seriously. The title song ""Riding with the King"" is an embarrassment. Save your money and your memories of who these guys used to be."
2,Please....,Get between Eric Clapton and B.B. King any way you can.... If you want to Save the Blues.My 2 star rating is in support for Blues Master B.B.King. I am really feeling the blues now. Blue about the money I spent on this CD.Pass on 'Riding with the King' and buy B.B.King's CD's (without Clapton} or any of Stevie Ray Vaughn's music. Now these two gentlemen Know the Blues.
2,Why is Clapton so highly rated?,"Clapton as usual runs through the same old pentatonic blues scale guitar riffs that he's been playing for years. And with very little imagination or even the attempt of trying something new on this album. I think Clapton is good, not great and he's certainly not God! I know he was one of the early pioneers of rock guitar but does anyone really think he stacks up equally to his peer group of Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck? I guess if you already love this stuff and accept that nothing new will come of it then you'll buy this anyway. On the other hand, if you want to avoid the latest slick packaging work from the record companies to snatch [more money] out of your pocket then steer clear."
3,"Good, but not what it could have been","While any collaboration between these two garners considerable attention, I am somehow left with the feeling that it could have better. Key to Highway, a classic blues tune known to most, if not all, who are familiar with Clapton and BB, is soulful and arresting, but some of the other selections are arcane and with most arrangements decent, if not predictable. Definitely worth your money but not the best money can buy. Three o' Clock blues alone is worth the price of admission. Go for it but don't expect too much."
4,"Fun, but less than I expected.","There are a couple of great tracks on here (come rain or come shine is one), and some classic tunes. The problem is that it feels like both of these men are in too much in awe of each other to play strongly together. There is a mutual deference in the playing that keeps several of the performances at a tepid level. Still worth having though, definitely."
3,Oh well...,"B.B. King and Eric Clapton are both up there among the worlds finest blues men, each in his own right. And that, I think, is the problem with this album. Technically, it's top notch but somehow the two doesn't quite meet on the middle. There's a disconnect somewhere. It's slick and blue but without the nerve and intensity vital for the blues to sprout wings and take off. The three stars are for the technical merits. The missing two for the lack of conviction. This album just doesn't get under my skin. Sorry guys..."
3,"Lotsa diamonds, some rust","There's no question that you get some top notch blues from these two greats. Unfortunately it's like the uncomfortable feeling of driving a Mercedes with a crumpled fender. The title song, although not all that bad, just sounds so commercial next to the really good stuff. And then there's the one that just makes you want to puke...""Marry You"". It's as though the producer called BB up at 11:00 in the evening and said ""we've got to have another track by midnight!"" My finger automatically hits the skip button when I hear the intros to these two songs and then I'm back in the groove again."
4,After a dozen playings,"This recording sounded good at first listening, and got better with each play. A well-balanced song selection predominates: some new material, some old favorites, some extended slow blues workouts, and two acoustic takes make for a varied program. This is Eric Clapton's album, focused and disciplined through BB King's music and signature guitar/vocal style. These old dogs have plenty of great tricks to display (they both know so many tricks, they don't have to learn new ones) as they play for each other and their audience. As usual, Clapton delivers the goods with his marvelous guitar playing; if you're a fan/devotee, this album is indispensable. Clapton can rerecord a song as often as he wants; he is so inventive and creative, and can wring so much new meaning out of each interpretation, that I want to hear it--over and over. This album is a special treat for listeners with high-resolution high fidelity playback systems."
4,Are you kidding?,"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to play BB King 8-tracks (YIKES) in the car and I HATED it! She would say, ""boy, don't you know you're ridin' with the King?"" When this CD was released I just sat and LAUGHED thinking back to 20 years ago when she'd say that. This CD was well done. An All-star effort, with the production values to match. The KING on the right, SLOWHAND on the left - this CD was meant to be enjoyed. The blues flavor has once again been enhanced by the 2 of the best! Here's to these two getting their just due when the Grammy's roll around. As for grandma...well she's gone now, but I'm SURE she knows that I am enjoying...RIDIN' WITH THE KING!"
4,Great Music From 2 Great Musicians !,"I never really listened to much of BB King until about 4 years ago when I went to a Blues Festival and I witnessed a stunning performance by BB King. His jokes and funny stories made you feel like you knew him for years. Maybe the highlight was when he did a hard rock song that had a few in the audiences head-banging! (Yes, this is BB King we're talking about) Then we have Eric Clapton, a great, mellow artist with one heck of a gift of playing the guitar. These two together on one record brings a fabulous performance, this will be one of the great new albums and is destined to be a classic. My favorites are ""Riding With The King"" and ""Hold On I'm Coming"", and ""Help The Poor""...You Blues Fans will not be dissapointed!"
1,Two blues great's don't necessarily equal a good blues album,"I bought this CD without hearing anything about it on the day it was released. I asked myself ""How great will it be to hear Eric and B.B. working together?"" With the typical expectation of fantastic chops(and being a guitarist myself, they were not unexpected), I put the CD in my car player leaving the store. I was horrified to learn that these two greats could fall so short in putting together a decent album.I felt like I was listening to a mutual admiration society recording, without the typical substance to the music, or the musicianship that I expected. I would definitely not recommend this recording to anyone who enjoys real blues, or is serious about ANY type of music. BB and Eric should stay away from each other and concentrate on what really is important...music rather than condescending playing."
3,Coffee Table Album,Like a Coffee Table Book-This is meant for display and gift giving not serious musical enjoyment. Is it bad? Nah..Is it among the best by either of these sometimes formidable artists? Not really.
2,Just Let B.B. Play,"Since the title is ""Riding With the King,"" one would assume that this would be an essential component to any CD collection. Wrong. While the title track is good, the ride turns into a crash course. Simply put, you can hear the commercialized influences of Clapton throughout the recording. This album had so much potential if only Clapton would have not produced it. B.B.'s the King so Clapton should have taken a back seat to him. While there are a few bright spots, overall it was a big disappointment. Next time, just let B.B. play."
4,Some classic tracks - but lacking raw energy of...,"...EC's and BB's live albums (e.g. From the Cradle, Live at the Regal). The album sounded good, but a little bland the first couple of times I listened -- I suppose I like my blues a little raw, and this is very polished and professional. The album quickly grew on me though. I particularly like ""Marry me"" (good energy and wah!) and ""I'm coming"" (guitar sex?). There are several other good tracks. The title track is pretty good when you get in the car in the morning (tip: just don't over play it!). If you find this a little too smooth for you, then I can highly recommend: Blues Breaker with Eric Clapton, From the Cradle and BB King Live at the Regency. Also check out Freddie King."
2,arrived on time and undamaged,This was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a DVD recorded show of BB and Clapton...it is only the music and plays on the DVD player. I was disappointed since I wanted the TV show!
1,What A Letdown!,"Both of these guys are great on their own, but together they really are lousy. I can't name a single song on this cd, which I threw out the same day I got it, that I would ever want to be forced to sit through again."
1,Zzzzz...,"Better than Sominex. This gets old fast. I don't understand all the acclaim that either of these artists have garnered over the years. Eddie Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page and dozens of others are better guitarists."
3,"Some good blues but i was disappointed, 3 1/2 stars","There are several good songs on this album such as ""Three O'Clock Blues"", ""Come Rain or Come Shine"", ""Key to the Highway"" (If you want the best version of Key to the Highway it's on the Derk and The Dominos- Layla album which was also clapton's band) and ""Worried Life Blues"". But i expected much better from two of the greatest guiatars to have ever lived."
4,"Cool, Laid Back Blues Guitar","Clapton and BB's legends precede them and, independently, these two artists are phenomenal. Both possess a powerful magic that drives a blues tune, and when one OR the other takes the lead, the song is epic. However, when both try to share the lead as with the title track, they sound oddly shy and hesitant. The laid back, cool style of this CD and the amazing blues riffs are sure to please you, but somehow, 1 + 1 only add up to 1.5 on this CD."
4,Awesome!!,I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written and it actually made sense! I think that Shane West and Mandy Moore did their roles very well. It was almost like they really were Landon and Jamie. It was like they weren't just made up. I was very impressed and I am going to get it soon. The chemistry between the characters was fabulous. Totally awesome!!!
4,Still can't top the book,"When the movie first began, I was wondering if I had made a mistake...it started completely different from the book. As the film progressed, I very much enjoyed it. It took the story from the book and made it something of its own...they modernized it. My question is...why? Can someone not relate to something from the past? This has to be broken down for people to understand? Audiences are smarter than that, and many films assume that the viewer cannot understand what is happening unless it is broken down. Give us some credit.Make no mistake...this was a terrific film, but the story in the book is vastly superior, more touching, and more human.The performances of Moore and West was fabulous...great chemistry between them."
5,"Best love story of ""our"" time","This movie should make everyone taka a look at thier lives and teach us not ot take anything for granted. We should not take love for granted and it shows us that romance should not die out. Our generation needs some ""good morale values"" movie to live by. I think casting teen icons like Shane West and Mandy Moore was a great idea because they set a good example for teens out there now. This is the best love story of ""our"" time and it sets excellent examples. It also should teach guys to go the distance for romance and girls to hold on to that ""flower"" as long as you can because there are guys that will wait. I hope they continue to make movies like this one. BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,a movie to remember,"When i watched a walk to remember, i couldn't believe how good mandy moore did. shane west, too, was very good. i have seen mandy moore in the princess diaries, and shane west in whatever it takes, but they were both much better in a walk to remember. i think that this movie definitely deserves the 5 stars i gave it!!"
5,GREAT Love Story,This is a great love story! Sad though the ending maybe it leaves you feeling good. Would recommend to teens and adults. Good lesson teacher.
5,A BEUTIFUL MOVIE ABOUT INNOCENT AND PURE LOVE.,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. A LOVE MOVIE HARDLY GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS BUT THIS FILM DID. THEIR LOVE IS SO PURE AND SWEET. THE PREFORMANCES BY SHANE WEST AND MANDY MOORE WERE PERFECT. IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL AND GREAT. ""A WALK TO REMEMBER"" IS THE ""LOVE STORY"" OF OUR TIMES. I WATCH IT EVERYDAY!"
3,I'll Always Remember...,"This movie is one of my favorites.Mandy and Shane did a great job.I,much like meny other people,read the book before seeing the movie.I loved both.But I did get mad over the part where Jamie gives Landon the book and says,""Don't worry,it's not a Bible."",but that is what it is in the book.Anyway,I loved this movie.If you're crazy about tha ""Candy"" singer or in love with ""Once and Again"" star then get this movie.Plus for the Mandy fans you get the music video""Cry""."
2,SYRUPY MARATHON OF CLICHES,"Hard to believe what a director can do with a perfectly decent novel. Nicholas Spark's book of the same name was rendered so shamelessly into a teen weepie that looks like a research effort on all the teen movies of the 90s; it probably has the about a hundred scenes swiped from them to show for itself.Think Love Story, Carrie, the Grease series, etc etc, perhaps all of the names you can think of contributed heavily to this sachharine drivel about a guy and a girl who start out oh-so-at-odds with each other in high school (she's a nerdy choir girl and he a prankster dude, but of course tides turn) and then perfectly predictable events ensue.To its minor credit, the film at least keeps away from typical teen movie gags and goes about its business with a predictable rhythm. It's probably a decent date movie, but not something you'd enjoy too much if you're over 20 (mentally)."
1,Very disappointed,"After reading the book a Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks, I was very excited to watch the movie. From the opening scene I was very disappointed. Don't bother watching this if you are expecting it to be anything at all like the book. The only similarities are the names of the characters."
1,Really?,700+ 5-star reviews? This is poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop poop!
4,It's about time...,"It's Capital C! No, it's not 'cancer' as you already know, but 'cheesy!' it cannot get any cheesier than that. An impossible love affair (popular boy & a social outcast girl) with Mandy Moore singing one of her own songs in full (She just had to sing)& a string of romantic scenes with a famous backgrounder.However, it comes to me as a great relief to finally view a teen movie with heart & values unlike other teen-flicks which gorge on sex, drugs & foul languages. Finally, a movie that teens can watch & learn from.If you want to view a more serious version of this film (e.g. serious acting), I suggest you watch Leeli Sobieski's movie. She shares the same fate as Mandy a.k.a. Jamie. Unfortunately, I do not remember the film's title, so you just have to search for it yourself."
2,Read the Book Instead,"I was incredibly disappointed in this shallow adaptation of a great book. Inexplicably, the author has sold out his endearing characters for a flat Hollywood production complete with a nauseating musical number thrown in to one of the central plot lines of the book - the sweet and innocent play. In the movie the play comes off like a meaningless High School Musical episode. Nicholas Sparks, who has the ability to create deep, flawed, and tremendously likable characters is willing to chuck all this aside for a payoff. If he had pressured them to produce something resembling his book and characters, we'd be talking about a classic for all time. I recommend the book, not the movie."
2,"Same old story, worse acting","Ok, tell me if you have heard this story line before: Innocent girl ends up being with the popular,arrogant guy, who shouldn't be with her in the first place. They fall in love, then there's the big secret, blah, blah, blah..... So, have you heard it before? I certaintly have. Except this time, the acting was horrendous. I could not get involved with any of the characters at all. Mandy Moore is a talented person, with a great voice, but she should really stick to what she does best: singing! If you want to see a much better movie with the exact same storyline, watch ""Here on Earth."" The acting is a whole lot better than ""A Walk to Remember"", along with a better cast. But if all you want to do is kill some time, this movie is tolerable."
3,Book was Better,"The first time I read the book it took me back the 1950 and I cried all the way through it. I went to see the movie, and like ALL Nicholas Sparks books....they run everything making it into a movie. The book is called ""A Walk to Remember"" for a reason. And the reason why is that Landon had to walk her home after he got in trouble because he didn't have a car and everyone walked back then. The relationship started on their walks.... I have had to disassociate myself from the wonderful books when I see the movie because I know that they are NOT going to be as good and this one really got off track like Nights in Rodante and Message in a Bottle where they added characters, and took out 1/2 the letters, and The Notebook where they changed the ending and have ruined any chances of ""The Wedding"" becoming a movie."
5,A Walk to Remember is AWESOME!,A Walk to Remember is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Landen Carter is sooo sweet it makes you cry! If you watch this movie be prepared for the water works. This movie is definetly an awesome movie that everyone should watch!!!!
5,A great movie,"I loved this movie. It was very good. Although, I thought the ending was kinda sad. It made me cry. Shane West and Mandy Moore are the perfect onscreen couple. It is easy to relate to, how people will do certain things to achieve goals."
5,A Walk to Remember: How to Pull Heartstrings,This is a very sweet movie. Although it is very different from the book in some parts. This is very much a teen movie but not in the same plot as ever way of movies such as She's All That [which I do love but...] I was on the verge of tears more than once. I warn you. This is a wonderful movie go watch it!
5,Joanna,"Wow, this movie was really amazing. I'm sure most people think that its another singer-turned-actress who really shouldn't have made the transition, but Mandy Moore did it really well. This movie will have you laughing, and crying. You will think twice about the realtionships that you have with other people. I loved the movie so much that i read the book right after. Though the book is different from the movie, they both capture everything. YOU SHOULD REALLY SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
5,C'mon give em a break....,"I honestly don't care what all the critics say. I actually liked this movie a lot, despite my initial low expectations for it. People, believe me, the trailer does not do this movie justice. I really did go in thinking that this was going to be another teen ""Oh, I love you! Oh, I love you too!"", sappy movie. But I was pleasantly surprised and I think this movie is very inspirational, in that it inspires faith, love and hope without overdoing it and one of the few movie adaptations that actually made me go and buy the book. Trust me, I don't read often, so that says something. I think that if you walk away and actually care about the characters in a story, then they must have did something right, and this is one of those."
4,An uplifting movie about a Christian main character,"I first saw this on TV, and decided to order it. The language must have been cleaned up for TV, because I was shocked at the use of bad language (four letter words) in this movie. Otherwise, it is an uplifting movie about a main character who is Christian. Instead of totally ridiculing Christians as most films do, this one shows the importance of faith in one's life. I would have given this five stars if not for the vulgar language. I was surprised at the ending, and love the song, ""Cry"", which is played during the rolling credits. My daughter heard this song years ago, and performs it well, singing and playing guitar."
5,Adorable,"I'm not sure how anyone could rate this below a 5 or 4, but then again some people are never satisfied with the movie-version of books. This is an absolutely adorable story of two completely different people. She has such a unique personality and she is so very sweet. Mandy Moore does an amazing job in this movie, as she always does. Landen is a party-boy, popular kid who learns where he is going in life. Though I do not know the name of this actor, he does very well too. Such a great cast and such a great story. I tear up every time I watch this. The ending was perfect too, even though it is sad."
4,Wonderful story,"This shows that a movie can be great without profanity, sexuality, or gore. A beautiful, positive story of being the best you can be. Peer pressure is something that can make you not like who you are when you're alone and the male lead in this discovers that he can live without the approval of the wrong crowd. And teaches them they can be better without doing wrong to impress someone else. The person you've always ridiculed and called names may be your best friend or the love of your life. A lesson to teens or adults who live to follow the crowd. Or just a great movie to relax with, with tissues handy of course."
3,Good Movie,"Although this movie was depressing, it still was a good movie. It was kind of slow though. It could of had more excitement going on. It's very emotional and makes you believe in the power of love. Not a bad acting job for Mandy Moore. She probably will get more movie offers because of this. Her singing ability has improved also."
3,"rent, don't buy","If I could, I would give the movie 3 1/2 stars. I'm not the biggest fan of Mandy Moore, but I decided 2 give the movie a chance. U've probably heard of the movies story so I won't go into all that. Mandy Moore didn't seem 2 have a lot of presence in the film. In my opinion, she seemed sort of dull in a few scenes. I must say, though, that there were a few scenes that she did fine in. The movie is predictable, but believable enough. I thought the end was moving. I think Shane West did a good job in this film, yet I wouldn't necessarily recommend this or rewatch it, but it's worth seeing once."
5,I LUVED A WALK TO REMEMBER,"A Walk to Remember was soooo good! Yes, it was a chick flick, but who cares?!?! IT WAS REALLY GOOD! I learned some things from it because it doesn't matter what's on the outside, but the inside that counts! This is a must-see movie! Don't miss it when it comes out on rental July 9th!P.S. Shane West is soooo hott!"
4,Cruciflicks' Review,"""If I had to sum up ""A Walk to Remember"" in one word, it would be this: cry. Just cry. And when you feel like you can't cry anymore, cry anyway."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""Whether you're a Christian or not, you can enjoy this movie. You can relate to the problems the characters face and the angst of high school cliques, first loves and losses. Yet, while entertaining its viewers, it still manages to include values, and most importantly, faith."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
5,Awesome,"It's a awesome movie, i love it, and the quality of the DVD is excelent, I wish to see it soon on BD."
5,Mandy Moore gives a spectacular debut,"I loved this movie; I saw it with my two best friends and we cried almost the whole time. I didn't think it would be that great because many singers have tried the whole acting thing and weren't very good. Mandy surprised me though; she couldn't have chosen a better movie to debut her acting skills. I could relate to a lot of her feelings being in high school myself (when I saw the movie). Shane gave a good performance also. His portrayal of a bad boy turned good, because of a girl, was very smooth. He didn't do it in just one day; he gradually did it. I think Shane and Mandy fit the parts perfectly. I also liked how the director took almost everything from the book and used it. So many movies made from books don't follow it very well.I wanted to see the movie because I read the book and I loved the it. In fact, I couldn't put it down; I finished it in one day. So, if you have seen the movie or if you haven't seen the movie, I suggest reading the book."
5,The best movie ever made!!,"This is the best movie ever. I cried just about the whole way through. It is so romantic. It was great to see a movie about two people so much in love. Even though Jamie is portrayed as a ""geek"" she still had a wonderful and loving relationship with a ""hot babe"" and she didn't change her style or personality to get it. A Walk to Remember is a great ""girly"" movie and is a must see."
5,True love story,"I believe this movie came out in the 90's, but I first saw it in 2008. I didn't think it would turn out as good as it did. I am completely obsessed with it ad I'm not usually into love stories. I thought the story line was perfect, it showed what real true love is and how it should be. I, like many others, cried at the end of the movie. It was tragic but I think it shows people how if you find love you should hold on to it and appreciate it. I loved the movie so much, I plan on adding it to my collection.I'm also in the process of reading the novel. I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who loves love stories. I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,Review for A Walk To Remember,"Dear All,I thought this movie was so great. It was the perfect romance story I have been waiting for for a long time. The plot of the story was fantastic and that actors/actresses had an outstanding performance. This movie will make you cry, laugh, and put a smile on your face. This movie has everything in it from romance to drama. I suggest if you haven't seen this movie to go buy it or see it because I know you will love it to. A Walk To Remember is also the perfect movie for couples to go see or watch at home. Overall I loved this movie and now it is my favorite!- Ashley"
1,A walk ro remember,"I was very disapointed by this film. Having read and loved the book. I was expecting something more along the lines of The Notebook film, but this isn't. Dissapointing as it could have been a great film. Most of what made the book a fantastic read was left out. Watch it if it's on TV but don't buy it."
1,Awfully Boring !!!!,This movie simply is boring and I had hard time to remain awake. Reading Mills and Boons is even better. It is a waste to even rent this movie let alone keeping it in your collection.
1,a walk to remember..............,...........a movie to forget/go to sleep on.why dont singers not named cher stick to what they(i guess)do best!?!?!?!?!pre teens sure arent picky when it comes to their entertainment!i can foresee glitter part 2 getting 5 stars from these sleepwalkers!
3,A Walk To Remember,I have yet to watch this one. I plan to watch this one with my friend this week-end. Hope it's good!
1,uhhhh,"This is two hours of my life I will never get back.The plot of it was like a series of cliches pasted together by a robot.But, you know, if schlocky romantic crap is your thing, go for it."
2,A Movie To Forget,"I rented this based on it's amazon good reviews. I watched about 40 Min. of this poorly acted, badly written drivel before I turned it off...should not have stayed so long. Can't understand what some saw in it."
3,Good but not great...,"I saw Walk to Remember on cable a couple months ago and I was taken by it. What I liked about it was there is violenc. No one is being blown apart in the first 10 minutes like most movies coming out of Hollywood these days. No one gets killed, etc. The acting is so-so but I do have to say I did like Mandy Moore and Shane West. Oh yes, the soundtrack is excellent. Alot of good 'alternative' music. I really like the Switchfoot songs. I'm now a Switchfoot fan. p.s. I'm over 50 plus. Wish they would make more movies like this."
4,Nice movie - Family-Edited Version,"This was a great feel-good movie about young love and the wonder of the human spirit! The actors do a great job portraying their characters, and there isn't a lot of unnecessary nonsense to bulk up the movie. While I am fine with having gotten the ""Family-Edited Version"" of the film, I would have liked to have known that's what I was getting before it arrived. There were even a few minor changes between this version and the made-for-television version I had seen. My concern about possibly not getting exactly what I ordered may deter me from ordering from this supplier again."
2,Not bad,I thought I was getting the original but instead I got the family version. I wish it would have showed what kind of DVD I was buying.
5,A walk to Remember,"Great movie to help us appreciate life, regardless of what you do or don't have.Allowing yourself to ""VALUE"" who or whom you are regardless what others may or may not see!"
5,tony's review,"man, great movie in the tradition of the real hollywood. mandy moore can act, hard to believe it was her fisrt big role. the chemistry betwwen her and shane west was awesome. not only will my life not be the same any more , but landon kinda makes you feel kinda shortin the romantic dept. glad it stuck fairly close to the book."
5,a powerful love story,"Landon Carter is the most popular boy at school, and Jamie Sullivan is the totally non-cool pastor's daughter. They're the most unlikely match to fall in love, and yet it happens! In a subtle but powerful way, Jamie influences those around her, causing relationships to be restored and even the worst kids at school are changed. There are a few brief unnecessary scenes, but it is still a beautiful story of love and trust in the midst of great difficulty."
5,AWESOME!!!,"i have to admit i never wanted to see this movie. when it came out, my dad asked me if i wanted to go see and and i said no, i thought it looked stupid, i was on vacation when it first came out on DVD, and there was nothing else to do so i rented it. WOW!! i watched it 3 times in less than 24 hours! i love this movie, its my favorite. it makes me want to be a better person and i hope someday i can have a relationship that good. this movie is great for people of all ages. if you are looking for a good romance, this is it! mandy moore and shane west give unbelievable performances, and they really make you feel what they feel. amazing acting, awesome music, and a simple story brilliantly told! wonderful direction by adam shankman, too!"
5,Walk to Remember,Bough this for my daughter and she LOVES the movie and the soundtrack. Is a beautiful story and a great lesson too.
4,I was totally surprise at how this movie moved me,I liked the story line and the innocence of this movie. I think it is a great movie for the young to watch. Walk in God's ways to experience what the truth can bring. Their is a plan for everyone's life (Jer 29:11 ) and God has a reason for our purpose on earth.You will truly enjoy this movie and won't be disappointed if you like heart felt movies.
5,A Walk to Remember a novel turned into a movie,"Shane West and Mandy Moore play Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan wonderfully! I had to read the book as a freshman for summer reading and I loved the story! A while back I watched the movie thinking that it was just another ""teen"" movie. I paid close attention to the plot of the story and it was well played out. Without revealing what happens, the story basically takes the 2 characters through the journey of self-discovery and love for their personalities. This defintely became one of my favorite movies.=]""Beauty only gets attention, but personality captures the heart.""Lucky D"
5,A Wonderful Movie,"I went to see this movie in the theater with a group of my friends for a girl's night out. There were about 10 of us that went, and we were all sobbing at the end, some even more than others. I had never cried at a movie before, but this one will touch your heart. Still today it is one of my very favorite movies. The soundtrack and the book are also must-haves."
3,Don't be fooled by her TRL image,"I must admit, I came into this film with my preconceptions of Mandy Moore and my own criticisms of her body of work, but this film really surprised me. I thought it was going to be a predictable Hollywood lovey-dovey, chick-flick. But it was much more than that. The story kept my attention and the performances were filled with intense emotion. During some parts of the film, it was slow, but it pays off if you stay with the film. Mandy Moore gives a very real and heartwarming performance. Plus, the discovery in the middle of the film is shocking and one that will have you saying ""whoa.""The minor characters were forgettable, but Moore and West shine as the two charismatic and attractive leads. Her singing in the film was good and it gave me a new-found sense of respect for Mandy Moore as a valid talent in the industry.Great movie to brighten your day. Recommended."
4,Suprisingly moving,"Don't get mad at me for saying this, but I got suckered into watching this DVD by my wife and daughter. By the end of the movie, I was glad that the lights were out in our den so that they couldn't see the water in my eyes. It's a surprisingly moving and affecting story, thanks in large part to the outstanding performance of Mandy Moore. Unlike her terrible, cliched, and hostile role in the movie SAVED, this movie is a vehicle for Moore to portray a Christian young lady in a positive light. Peter Coyote as Moore's father gives a restrained but powerful performance that left a lump in my throat. This is a great family viewing experience that isn't corny but is packed with drama and reward."
5,"Refreshing, different, haunting and so simply beautiful","I haven't been genuinely touched by a film in years. I am haunted by this one. Mandy Moore's character Jamie is unadorned and unforgettable. Her inner beauty shines through on the strength of the character's incorruptible virtue and genuine sweetness. It's a refreshing reminder of the largely forsaken power a woman has to set the tone in a relationship on a higher plane if she really wants a knight in shining armor, which Shane West's character Landon ultimately proves to be. I wish there were more movies like this one, and more people in the world like Jamie Sullivan. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an endearing story of genuine love, pure and simple."
5,a walk to rememeber,A walk to remember is one of my favorite movies of all time. It just shows how much 2 people can love each other that are totally diffrent. Shane west and mandy moore make the cutest couple!:) and in my opinion mandy moore is a great actress!Now remember dont watch the movie without a kleenex!
4,Movie to Remember,"I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down and watched this movie. I am not sure what I was expecting but what I walked away with was a smile. Mandy Moore (Jamie) and Shane West (Landon) give a great performance as two teenagers from different ends of the popularity scale who, when thrust together by fate, find out how well they compliment each other. Jamie helps Landon become a better person and Landon helps her come to terms with what is happening to her in her life. It was nice to see a teen movie based on something other than sex. It will make you laugh and cry. So get your tissues ready!! A beautiful movie for the young and the old.....for anyone who has ever been in love.The soundtrack is wonderful as well.....you should check that out....just as good as the movie!!!"
5,Tear jerker!,"Love this movie! My husband and I even saw this in the movie theater. He later admitted that even though it was a ""chic flic"", he still liked it!"
4,Good but....,"The movie is really good but not recommended for easy hearts. I had rent the DVD just because Shane West was playing in it (he's such a hottie!) I had read in a magazine that it was a ""romantic COMEDY""... GET REAL !! at the end of the movie I was crying for more than an hour! The story's very sad!! But anyway, I would say that it's a good one. Enjoy and don't forget your kleenex !!!"
2,Read the Book,"Before watching ""A Walk To Remeber"" by Nicholas Sparks I strongly urge you to read the book. The book was one of the most amazing stories I have read. It will make you want to be a better person,while the director simply turned this beautiful story into another teenage love story. The director left out all of the beauty of the people in the story. If your a teenage girl this movie is fine. For adults however, this movie is another big disappointment."
1,Never saw it.,"I didn't watch the movie because you never sent it. Plus I wanted to buy not rent, your web sight was to tough for me to navigate, I will not buy or rent from you again."
3,"Been there, done that","I had never read the book, so I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Or so I thought. This movie has the same plot as about a thousand other movies, and has been done about a thousand times better. Bad boy meets good girl. They fall in love against the opposition of friends and family. Bad thing happens. Have you seen West Side Story? Romeo and Juliet? This movie is nothing but average. The two stars would be better suited to silent films, because their facial expressions and mannerisms are so exaggerated. Peter Coyote is totally wasted as Mandy Moore's overprotective father, and Darryl Hannah sleepwalks through her part. If this is best example of what teens of today should be watching, then they should start reading more."
2,Oh Please,"This movie was way too sappy and predictable. I think the idea of the movie was sweet, but it's already been done and re-done... Though Shane West is undeniably good looking and appealing as the bad boy w/a good heart, the idea of such a character is as fictional as the unicorn. Not to mention, how many movies have the ""nerdy"" girl that everybody picks on, then voila, she's beautiful, just add make up and a new hair do (I wish it was that easy for me in high school)! I felt the emphasis on Christianity and faith was laid on way too thick. It bordered on preachy. Not to mention they throw in the inevitable tear jerker: ""I'm dying..."". The movie tried way too hard to tug at heartstrings.I give it an extra star for Landon's classic Camaro."
2,"Shady, sad","At first the darkness, cursing and foolish stunt leaving one boy nearly dead was just BAD, better to have left it out. The rest of the movie is an honest effort to actually have a healthy love story, but is stopped by illness. Dark, shady and sad."
3,Read the book.,"The DVD is fine and dandy, but the book is ever so more compelling, and it will get your attention better than the movie. I didn't like some parts of the movie, it just seemed too immature and obnoixious, but I find myself in the state of re watching A Walk to Remember on HBO and such, so in that case, I know I do truly love the movie. I love Mandy Moore, and she is just too adorable, along with the hunkalicious Shane West."
4,powerful movie,This is not my favorite type of movie but I must say...very real performances by Mandy Moore and Shane West. Even if you dont like this kind of movie you will be saying the same. Poor mandy :(
5,UNFORGETTABLE,"I read the book ""A Walk to Remember."" Shane West and Mandi Moore did exceptional jobs at making these characters come to life. For an acting debut, Mandi Moore was excellent in the role of Jamie and captured Jamie's innocence beautifully. Shane West shows enormous range as an actor in this role as he comes of age in this beautiful story. I am hoping to see him in many future roles. It is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again and in some way, will become a part of you. It will lift your spirits, and take your breath away."
2,Read the Book,The story veers SO far from the book. I can't believe that Nicholas Sparks approved the screenplay. Mandy Moore and Shane West don't seem to have much chemistry on-screen. Acting was only so-so. Did not enjoy this movie.
3,Very Sweet,"I am a sensitve guy, so this movie touched me very deeply. It is passionate and very well written.I wish I could hfind a love like this..."
4,A great addition to the book,"The movie was really great except for the fact that they left out the main reason that the book was called a walk to remember. I decided to read the book before it came out and it was wonderful. Jamie and Landon are total opposites but somehow they find love. I read it in one day and cried my eyes out in the end. In the book though, when Jamie and Landon get married,Jamie, who was too weak to stand was in awheelchair. But with a little bit of help, she walked down the church without her chiar, Landon describes this as ""A Walk To Remember"", I found that part to be the most touching part of the whole story and was outraged when I saw that they did not include it in the movie. Otherwise, the move was a great addition to the book."
5,Sets a great example.,"I'm so glad that1)Nicholas Sparks wrote this book2)This book has been made into a movieMedia has a big problem with stereotyping virgins, Christian people, and girls for that matter. This movie shows that someone with unquestionable faith has virtues of their own. I admired Jamie Sullivan and thought that she was a loving tribute to Nicholas Spark's sister Danielle Sparks, whom Mr. Sparks wrote the character in memory of .Jamie was smart, sassy, independant, and strong. Many qualities that society ignores and has replaced with being physically desirable, fornicating, and partying.Oh how the meek have not fallen. They humble themselves, but it does not make them weak, but stronger. They're memory lives forever in this movie and with positive reviews."
5,It's an Awesome Movie.,"Well this movie was sort of a surprise. I was expecting the same old, same old, but this movie actually moved me.The acting is excellent with Shane West (Once and Again) playing Landon who is a little wild. When one of his pranks hurts another student he is made to join the drama club and tutor younger children. This is where he meets Jamie played by Mandy Moore.This movie is great and will effect the viewer in many different ways.Your a fool if you don't watch this movie at least once."
1,Lame,Hollywood will continue to produce this trite garbage as long as people will continue to buy it.
2,Total Sap,"This movie is total sap from beginning to end. This is by far the sappiest movie I've seen in years. It has all of the classic elements of sap: boy and girl from mutually exclusive social realms fall in love and one of them dies at the end (hmmm just like Rome and Juliet, West Side Story, Titanic, and a myriad of other stories with the same plot). This movie piles on the sap extra thick at every turn. For those reviewers who thought that this was a good teen movie, all I can say about that is, ""You've got to be kidding me."" This movie is as non-intellectual and unrealistic as many of those mindless movies that the film industry targets at teenagers. If you like total sap, then this movie might be for you. For those of you like a movie with substance, don't waste your time."
2,Incredibly Sappy,"This is just a complete mass of incredibly sappy people acting in a completely sappy movie...my friend cried, but i thought it was pretty stupid. My friend is now watching it for the 4th time this evening (at 3:00 in the morning) and its starting to get REALLY OLD! What was the purpose? I mean, yeah she dies. just say so and get it over with...don't drag it out for 45 years. I mean, you can pretty much guess what's gonna happen. We predicted a lot of things that happened. I guess if you like this sort of movie, it'd be ok...certainly not for guys! My friend says that it would be a good girlfriend/boyfriend movie, if the boyfriend was REALLY patient. I have one thing to say about Mandy Moore's wardrobe: all of her dresses looked like TENTS!"
5,Great movie,I think that this movie is a very inspirational movie. If you have not had the privilege of watching you definitely should!
2,This is a walk I'd like to forget,"Okay, picture it. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy turns his life around and has life-changing experiences because of girl. Sound familiar? It's only been done about a million times. This is as cliche as it gets.The story is incredibly weak. The characters love each other, hate each other, and love each other again from one scene to the next. The plot is very, very flimsy to say the least. Oh, and the acting is horrendous. Even the high school play didn't look acted well enough to have been real.Like I said, the plot is weak, but at least there is a good moral to the story, and at least it's clean. It has a touching ending, with everyone loving each other and living in perfect harmony, but that just isn't enough for me. If you're like me--if you want an actual plot in the movies you watch--you might want to avoid this one."
2,Boring!,"This was obviously a movie for the ""Dawson's Creek"" crowd of teenagers. Mature viewers would have a hard time getting through the entire film without falling soundly asleep.Felt like I was watching a music video, with the constant soundtrack. Mandy Moore is a great actress, but this movie was not the best vehicle for her talents."
1,Terrible,No substance to movie. Poor choice on my part. Rather watch paint dry. Acting was juvenile and story line very predictable.
1,Another horrible movie based on a great book.,"They completely butchered the storyline of this great book with this version of the movie. Additionally, the acting is atrocious. It is so disappointing when this happens to fantastic books."
2,Cheeeeeeeesy!,"Cheesiest movie ever!..Huge misconception about love, too idealistic!.. one of the cheesiest movies I ever saw! do not waste your time i could not even look."
2,I'm so sorry to say that I didn't like it!,"I love Mandy Moore's voice, I love the fact that she hasn't compromised her principles now that she's such a big star. But this movie does not do her justice. I think the problem was the whole story line. Way too unbelievable and yet predictable at the same time. I admit some things were really cute and romantic but there were so many loose ends at the end of the film that I am still left wondering - ""What's with the stupid sweater!!!?"" I kept thinking throughout the movie that perhaps they would explain that it was her mom's and that's why she wore it all the time but NO! There WAS no explanation whatsoever! Truly frustrating. Also, the scene in the school play where she sings - oh yes she's got a beautiful voice but songs in plays don't usually go on and on for THAT long. Weird! There's much more I could say if I watched it again but I couldn't - I just couldn't subject myself to another viewing."
3,okay,what can I say.It was nothing special in my opinion.Its not the best but its not the worst.so yah it was okay other then the fact that there is a very low chance of a popular insecure guy who falls for a sick low geeky girl.(very fake)but other then that it was AWESOME!
2,Like watching pieces of every YA show on WB,"Watching ""A Walk to Remember"" is like having to endure not only ""Dawson's Creek"" but every one of its WB clones - complete with picturesque setting and scenery-chomping teens (both good and bad) who seem to have been born speaking the arch language known as teen-movie-ese. The story is simple enough - a bad-boy (West) comes together with the good-girl (Moore) daughter of the town's Minister (Peter Coyote). They have nothing in common, so everybody who knows each of them must do their utmost to keep them apart. The comedic possibilities obviously eluded the script which plays up the story's romantic aspects and keeps it straight (never going for the quirks that make ""Gilmore Girls"" such a treat) by relentlessly tugging at your heartstrings. I know that we've been deluged by crude-teen flicks, but even ""American Pie"" was smarter and had more heart than this confection which shamelessly sends you in search of a box of Kleenex and offers nothing in return."
5,Favorite love story besides The Notebook!,I could watch this movie over and over!!! a definite must see!! Mandy and Shane are perfect for the roles!
5,AMAZING MOVIE!!!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE BEST TEEN FLICKS THIS YEAR IF NOT THE BEST.I WAS A LITTLE SCEPTICALE BECAUSE ANOTHER POP STAR TRYING TO ACT I WAS ALITTLE WEARY BUT MANDY MOORE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS LITERALLY SMASHED THIS MOVIE I THOUGH THE BOOK WAS A LITTLE BETTER BUT I LOVE THE MOVIE JUST AS MUCH.IF YOU BUY ONE MOVIE THIS YEAR THIS SHOULD BE IT AND PICK UP THE SOUNTE=RACK TOO.THIS MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD.AND SHANE WEST WAS GREAT AS USUAL I HOPE THEY DO ANOTHER MOVIE TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE. ""TWO BIG THUMBS UP!"" ----D"
4,Mandy Moore Steals the Show,"I will be the first to admit that the book A Walk to Remember wasn't my favorite Nicholas Sparks novel, and I was a little annoyed they were turning it into a teen sugar pop movie. I was prepared to hate it.But sitting in the movie theater with all my friends, I was pleasantly suprised.Mandy Moore shows us that she is not just an airhead pop singer, but an actress, and a good one at that. I walked away from the theater with a new respect for the eighteen year old celebrity.I also walked away with a handful of used tissues and tear stained cheeks. So be prepared to cry!"
3,Walk to Remember,"I purchased this video as a present for my wife, who is in a nursing home. She really enjoyed viewing it."
5,Just Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If u already experienced it then this movie will forever be your #1 favourite. I cried the whole time during the movie. U just have to watch it.
4,Fast forward review,"David Hamilton will be instantly recognizable to sleaze fans, and these movies are just his books put into motion. Considering the sheer volume of underage nudity (or at least that illusion, which is carried off well), they have to be classed as a genuine bargain.We got several scenes with a bunch of nubile teenies in various stages of undress lying around taking naps on a bunch of silky beds (all together in a big common room with gauze curtains for some reason, I didn't follow the ""plot""), and girls undressing and swimming and girls undressing and dressing and undressing . . . or maybe that was ""Bilitis"" or ""Tender Cousins""? Well, it really doesn't matter, for lolita fans you need them all anyway, so get cracking . . . so to speak."
5,Falling Cycle was one of the best,"First of all regarding the comment below, Falling cycle was headlining hardcore venues when As I lay Dying were still nobodies in Carlsbad, if anything As I lay Dying sounds like Falling Cycle.And what made Falling Cycle so great was their live shows, they sounded perfect, AILD, Unearth, all those other bands could not convert the energy from the album to a live show."
3,Heard It Before,"I agree with Raised Fist on this one. FC does have talent, but all I hear is As I Lay Dying with another name. There are so many more great bands out there than these guys. It literally almost sounds like I'm listening to the same song over and over again. Talent 4 stars, creativity 2 stars."
5,why do all the great bands break up?,"seriously i went into a state of depression when i heard FC broke up. this cd was so different from everything else when it came out in 2002. very heavy, but very melodic at the same time. the breakdowns would make your head spin. if you can find this cd anywhere, pick it up instead of what you were going to buy in the first place"
2,Weird movie!,"I thought the movie was alright, but I am sorry that I bought it. I would rather have just rented it. It seems like half of the movie is out of focus, I am sure it is on purpose but I just don't get it. There are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price."
2,"ok, I guess but not much here...","This movie is ok, but there really isn't much here. If your'le looking for a non-consensual sex, then look else where. This movie is more about physical abuse, and satinism that it is anything else. Not my cup of tea. Also, is you sensetive to the sounds, like I am, then the dubbing in this movie will drive you crazy."
3,Great tunes...too bad the groups were past their prime.,"A few of the great vocal groups from the 50's singing some great tunes, but recorded sometime in the late 60's perhaps, so the vocals show their age. The music on most of the songs is done in the synthesized remake style that disappoints the true afficionado. One stand out is ""When was the Last Time"" by the five keys."
5,Mother Kali,"Goddess Kali has been part of the Indian religious tradition for thousands of years. She is mentioned in the ancient books. In the last 2000 years, the famous worshippers of Goddess Kali are the great poet Kalidasa, and the saints of Ramakrishna Ashram. Goddess Kali is benevolent as well as fierce. The State of West Bengal and her big city Kalicut (Calcutta) are well-known for Kali worship, even though all of Asia worships Her. This book is written so well it is accessible to Westerners. The symbolism of the many aspects of the Goddess is explained very well. Great author."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,Sure it's cute but it doesn't do anything. The feet you're supposed to pour with are too small to hold more than a drop and are full of holes anyway. The pushbutton in the center to make the fish go never did work. It's all kinds of tubing and kinks and glue inside so we couldn't even figure out what wasn't sealed right. Our girl was bored in 5 minutes so we gave it away.
3,"Fun bath toy, minor flaws","This is a cute toy. I liked that the hands detached into a scoop and sieve. My only problems with it were after a while, the suction cups didn't hold on as well and it was always crashing into the tub late and night, and secondly, since the toy is filled with water, hard water stains built up in the inside. But overall, it was a fun tub toy."
4,I thought it was great...,"I haven't had a chance to listen to the CD, but watched a live performance of all of the songs on Direct TV. It was great! I totally diasagree with the negative reviews."
1,Bad Idea,"This CD should come with a warning label. I doubt that Hip-Hop fans will like it, and I know that anyone who remembers Brazil 66 will hate it. What's next for Will.I.Am, an ""updated"" version of all the Dixie Chicks ""hits""? Maybe they could colaberate on a moderdernized version of the National Anthem for track one. I had to clean my player and take a shower after this one. I tried to give this CD away free on Amazon, but that fell below the minimum price for used CD's, so I put it where it belongs, in the garbage. Come on reviewers, ""keeping it real"" should mean telling the truth, not being politically correct."
5,a manual for those preparing for ordained ministry,"William Willimon introduces his book as his ""loving, grateful, but not uncritical meditation upon the ministry of the ordained"" after 30 years of pastoral ministry and nearly as many in academia preparing others for ministry. He lays out four theses: 1) Ministry is an act of God, 2) Ministry is and act of the church, 3) To be a pastor is to be tied in a unique way to the church, the believing community of Christ, and 4) Ministry is difficult. He writes the book as a manual, a kind of textbook for those preparing for ordained ministry, and as a remembrance and a recalling for experienced pastors hoping that for both groups it will be a ministry of encouragement."
1,Disappointing,I don't know who would like this. A reunion concert with repetative commentary by Timothy Leary.
4,The South's Devastation,"Things get complicated for the Brannon Family. Titus who the family thought was dead arrives home from the prison camp. His welcome home is to find his wife Polly married to Henry and expecting a child. Almost half of the books is devoted to Grant's Wilderness Battle and Sheridan's march through the Shenandoah. All of this is devastating for the South. He keeps you turning the pages. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,Enter a magical world for adults and children! Wondrously delightful!,"I have loved paper dolls my whole life. When I was preschool age, I would draw a doll with the cardboard from the shirt packages my dad got and then I would draw my own outfits with newsprint and color them with crayons. What fun.These are the most beautiful paper dolls I have seen yet. If you notice the other reviews, only one was negative saying the outfits were not pretty. I am utterly flabbergasted. These outfits are for FLOWER FAIRIES, so of course they are made of petals and other woodland materials! Don't miss out on the fun and beauty of these dolls, get one for all the sweet girls you know and keep one for yourself. I did."
5,Flower fairies rock!,"These are the best paper dolls I've found anywhere -- my two granddaughters love them, any little girl will."
2,well made but not very pretty,"the dolls are made from very good paper, very sturdy. And I have to say I like the design of the clothes whereas they have a front and back that fold over the dolls. The dolls themselves are very pretty.The details are very nice but the dresses are just not very pretty. My girls and I expected fairy tales dress but got a little too woodsy ones. the colors are really quite dull- a lot of browns and greens. Pretty pastels or bright colors like flowers would have been better. The best thing we can do is mabey make our own dresses.Sorry, can not recommend this to anyone. I would not have wasted my money it if I had seen it in a store first."
4,Review,I am happy with the book but unhappy with the packaging and how the books were sent. They were put in a plastic cover but one side was open and the books had no other packaging to support them so the edges of the smaller books were damaged as they slid around in the box.
2,Flower Fairies Paper Dolls,"Great Vendor and reasonable shipping. This item was considerably durable for a paper doll. The fairies were made from a heavy card stock that I think would hold up well. My grand daughters did not play with this item, instead they took it home to play with."
3,Not as durable as I'd hoped,"I got these for my 5 year old for her birthday. I thought they were beautiful and who doesn't love fairies, right? The reviews indicated they were durable. Eh, they're not that durable, folks. This in part because the outfits have to go on over the fairies' heads, so any time you're changing an outfit you're putting stress on the doll (unless you're veeerrrry careful). The tabs don't stay shut past the first use, therefore the outfits don't stay on flat against the doll. My daughter was also not thrilled that there weren't that many outfits for them. For the price of the product and how long it's lasted, I don't think it's worth it. I've gotten cheaper paper dolls that work the same or better."
5,Recommend!,These are better quality than other paper dolls we've bought. They don't seem like they have as much potential to rip and break and they are a good design. Really pretty and nice that there are four dolls to share and play with! Great set! If you purchase the book collection and coloring pages too it makes a beautiful gift!
2,MSG is MIA,"if you think this is going to be a good rocking show,skip it. if you like MS,then maybe buy it.but to me it sux."
4,Master Schenker,Best MSG concert that I have ever bought!The video/audio recording is great!I have never been to an MSG concert before. But I guess this is the closest ever I will get to a REAL MSG concert!Recommended to all MSG fans!Long Live Master Schenker!!!
5,Car Diffuser Aromatherapy,Just put a few of you favorate drops on the pad and it last a long time. I use clove oil and my whole car smell great.
4,decent.,for the price this product worked very well...if you want to always use it you may want to spend a little more money on one....but for the price this product works very well...
3,car diffuser,These things are great! This one is a bit chinsy (cheap) and I think they should come with more essential oil pads but it does work and I guess that is all that really matters.
1,Didn't meet expectation,"The car must be running and the diffuser has to 'warm up' before the aromatherapy kicks in. If you are driving short distances, you will never smell it. Big bummer :("
1,flop,"i purchased two. one for my car and one for my truck and when i plugged them in nothing happend, i was really excited about scenting my car with natural oils but the pine tree from the car wash works better. i left them in the outlet for at least 30 min. the time it takes me to get to town but nothing. i'll stick to smelling myself and leave the gadgets alone."
3,"Works o.k., but I had to use a better oil than what came with it.","After I changed out the oil that came with product, and used one from my own collection...I was able to 'smell' the oil in my car. Major problem...the scent doesnt last long. I will not buy another one for my other car....I guess I got burned on this one ;o)"
2,works but...,This works but does not produce a long lasting scent. You have to reapply essential oil often to get the smell in your car. Would not recommend.
2,aromatherapy car diffuser,The scent pads tend to dry out quickly and I need to refill too often. It works just as well to put a drop anywhere in your car.
2,Weak output,"Even in a small car, this diffuser puts out a marginally noticeable fragrance...unless you use a powerful oil like spearmint."
4,features,"When you start your car, the diffuser lights up with a green light. When you turn the engine off, the light goes out and the diffuser is off. Also, there are 5 pads that are included with this device, but they are hidden well within the package. I almost threw the package away, until I decided to tear the package open completely."
2,Wildlife Waterfowl & Wading Birds,"Very disappointed in the content and packaging of this book relative to its price. While nicely done it definitely is not worth $88. For that price the book should have been hard back and contain a great deal more of content, examples, and information. This should be priced more in the range of the third book I ordered, ""Keys to Painting Fur & Feathers.""This was quite a shock when I received considering the cost outlay."
1,Why does Stephen Moore still Pontificate on NPR in 2009 ?,"The book is pure fantasy and partisan propaganda. Stephen Moore is on Diane Rehm today, June 17 2009, telling listeners how global warming is a bunch of baloney. If the guy, who claims to be an economist, was so 'bullish on Bush' in 2004, and was so wrong on the consequences of Bush policies, why is he put on the airwaves to blow hot air on climate change? These Republican supporters go from causing one train wreck to creating another."
1,Overrated bore of a book,"I bought this book having enjoyed Moore on TV many times. However, Moore should stick to TV as this rambling, one-sided, economics disaster-of-a-book put me to sleep on three different occasions. The foreword by Larry Kudlow (who I'm not impressed with on TV) definitely got things off on the wrong foot as Moore ran with this book the rest of the way. Too bad he was running into the wrong end zone. Very disappointing, considering how short the book was. Too much GOP cheerleading, too little objective analysis."
2,Not worth it,"As simple as that, it is just another boring world-music/lounge CD. If you own some claude challe / costes stuff don't bother purchasing this. This compilation just tries to ride the lounge wave and cash in. Not worth it."
2,OH! Boy! Another Von Stade!,"What else can I say! I've been an admirer for thirty years, and to my taste Von Stade, like Von Otter and a few others, can do no wrong. This has some new stuff, always welcome, and an interesting variety. If you like Von Stade, not to be missed."
1,LOW VOLUME BOOTLEG!!,I bought this CD NEW! The first song was so low I had to turn the volume on my stereo to the max to hear it! The next 3-4 song were fine but then the rest of them skipped!!! I am so disappointed! Its like I ordered a used bootleg!!
1,unable to install battery,"If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. I thought I would try to replace he battery myself after watching the video. The alternative is buy a new PDA. There was no instructions on how to remove the leather cover, but it finally fell off when the case was pried apart. A little plastic piece fell out - I guess it was the attachment for the cover. I have no idea how to replace it. I tried all the little tools to unscrew the two screws on the motherboard, but none would do it. Now I'll have to take the whole mess to the computer repairman that works on my table top. I am really disappointed that the video and instructions were missing the details to do the job."
3,Too good to be true?,"I am always looking to buy the best product for my money. In this case i was excited to find a triple pack of these great films being about under $15 each. My hesitation was that it was a mixed region collection and i was worried that they would not play on my Bluray player. So when i was finally got them i was eager to test them. Everything turned out good except the disc region notes telling me that the disc's may take longer during chapter sequences to load depending on the Bluray player models. Kill Bill vol.One had a ""skip"" like problem during the beginning of the movie but other than that all three disc's where good. It did worry me so i felt like that was the chance i had taken being this a mixed U.S/Canadian region combo pack."
3,Not That Bad At All (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars),"This is one of those movies that was pushing 2 1/2 stars. I gave it a higher rating for two reasons: because most of the females in the movie looked hot, and I some how managed to laugh throughout most of the movie. This isn't a bad movie overall, but it does have some bad parts. It wasn't the best acting ever, but it was okay in this movie. Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg do an excellent job playing their parts and the plot execution is okay as well. Then you have a lot of popular west coast rappers in this movie as well aside from Dre and Snoop that many will easily recognize (I'm suprised Ice Cube didn't get mixed up in this). If you want to see a a few rappers and some nice females in a laughable movie, then check this out. It's not the best movie out there, but it isn't the worst. This is one of those movies that will be on TBS in about 2 years. Peace!"
5,good movie!!!!,"yo this was a pretty good movie. the acting isnt to bad. dre is a cool actor, and snoop really has gottin in to this acting thing. i mean he had two movies out in the theater at the same time. not all parts of this movie were funny. some times they try to hard. other than that its a good flik. yo check out eminem playin the role he was born to play."
5,"good film also, features apperances from alot of poeple.","I recently just rented this movie and really enjoyed it. This film was actually funny,especially when Chris(Eminem)was making death threats to Mr. Washington.(George Wallace) Now let me get to the appearances. They Include:Ludacris, Shaq, Kurupt, Bruice Bruice,Truth Hurts."
2,Not As Good As Friday,I recently watched The Wash on DVD the other night and I was kinda disappointed by it. I have been a fan of the movie Friday since it came out and for people to say that The Wash is like Friday they're wrong Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg are dynamite rappers but they need to work on their acting skills
1,poor,"I thought this movie was going to be hilarious, being dr. dre & snoop dogg were in it. but it's poorly done, not even funny really. snoop & dre should just stick to the music business! this flick does'nt even come close to ice cube's fridays flicks. just beware"
3,Snoop an Dre a saving grace,"This movie is basically about Snoop somking and hooking up w/ some hood rats, while Dre works hard to make his half the rent and not get any ... The acting on the parts of the others is weak and the plot is thin. But if you like Snoop, Dre, Xzibit, Eminem, and other rappers you'll enjoy the movie just beacuse of the Cameo's, just don't expect a good plot or well developed characters"
2,What is the plot,"I watched this expecting some type of storyline, but got nothing. This movie was a waste of time and somebody's money. The acting was horrible. DJ Pooh, who everyone knows co-wrote, needed some help on this one. He tried with failed on 3 Strikes as well, but that was funnier. Even George Wallace couldn't save this sorry piece of ""art."" The soundtrack is better than the movie. They should've just given the movie with the soundtrack instead of the other way around. The only reason why I gave this 2 stars is 1 star each for Snoop & Dre for what they are really good doing: making music."
1,Copy protected???,"Three thumbs down for some kind of copy protection...that won't play in my Toshiba sd2700! Played on my Apex player, but...couldn't watch it on the big TV. Movie was boring and wasn't funny..."
1,a rental,"gotta wonder what the heck pooh was thinking. the wash is a bad movie - and i don't mean bad in good way, i'm talking bad in an extremely terrible way. trying to remember a funny part, and can only come up with one - which involves snoop and tommy chong (cheech and chong). would have given less than 1 star - but the scale doesn't allow a lower rating than 1. if you must view it, break out your video rental card, pick up some no doze and coffee, maybe put on a pair of sneakers two sizes too small, and you might be able to stay awake through it."
5,DJ Pooh is the master,"DJ Pooh is the master of urban comedies. Snoop and Dre are great in their roles as workers as a local car wash. The plot is nothing amazing, but the movie moves at a great pace and never slows down. If you dont buy it at least rent it."
1,Fairly Wack,Snoop had some funny lines but overall this film is at best a direct to Video type of film.this film in no way should be compared to Car Wash at all it ain't even close.this film is surrounded with a 2ns tier cast of Comedians overall to me.I dig George Wallace He had some moments.Eminem did nothing for this clunker.Dr.Dre has no Screen Pressence He tries to hard.Music is His Strength not Making Film.
3,ummmm,this is a film with snoop n dre. the story and dialogue is mostly poor but the funnier moments r worth watching again. my advice is get richard pryors car wash which is better and is the basis of this flick
2,Not that funny,"Before I watched this movie I expected lackluster acting but a funny script as it was written by DJ Pooh (Friday). I was right about the acting, which was bad. Dre bored me the whole time he was on screen, and Snoop was OK I guess (but wasn't this supposed to be a comedy?) - DJ Pooh did make me laugh a few times at his character, the dumb kidnapper. The plot was basically wack, and the movie just ends suddenly, and you think...what JUST happened? is that it?!! Don't bother spending money on this, but wait for it to come on TV."
2,The Whack!!!,Ok the title was lame like this movie but give me a break!!! I really didn't like this movie and the special features on this one don't even make it worth buying........not even worth renting unless you haven't seen it.Have you seen the movie Putty Tang???.......If you have and didn't like it....like the majority of the world didn't...then I recommend that you don't pick this Putty Tang kinda like movie up....Like Siskel and Rouper....I give this DVD two thumbs down!!! Peace out folks!!!
4,Way better than Moby Dick for adventure and drama,"Moby Dick is so dry for young readers with all the details of life on a whaler, this book is much more the adventure, the what happens when the whale decides that he's had enough. How men endure when they run out of food, then water, then people start to die. It's a fairly fast read and Owen gives a fairly good account of the problems and the horror of the men as they watch the whale ram their ship."
5,Kim Wilde is wilder then ever,"I own Born to be Wild, i heard that song before but Kim Wilde did an excellent cover of smash hit Born to be Wild she took it to another lever, very dance and hip style. I love there is some guitar in it too. And another surprise B side song All About Me another hot dance-electro pop song from Kim and her voice sounds so pure and hot, all about Me has very interesting lyrics too that i really enjoy, ""Its not about you, Its all about Me, Its nothing u said, i have to be free"" sounds little bit like Madonna die another day. Overall i really enjoyed the Cd single with few surprise remixes too."
5,"Kim Wilde sounds soo HOT, wilder then ever","I just receieved my copy of Born to be Wild and i have to say i love it, i always thought that Kim Wilde has a great voice, but with this song she really proves it one more time that she is not just another sex bomb pop star. I love the 1st track Born to be wild, its so up tempo with some guitar and rock tunes but with all that its very techno-dance. I can't get this out of my head :) ohhhh and 4th track All about Me Kim surprises you with her new track ALL about ME, its an electro futurastic track but very pure, Kim's voice sounds almoust unreachable but song ends with surprise Electro ending which im not gona give away,, Buy it and then you will thank me, Can't wait for Kim to release her new album"
5,Hold your breath and listen!,"EVERYTHING in this recording is superb! Dernesch makes for an absolutely convincing Cassandra, but Ludwig carries the day (as always) as the most convincing Dido I have ever heard. She uses not only her fabulous voice, but also her mind to portray this difficult role.You end up in tears literally FEELING her pain at losing her lover."
4,Good watch for the $,"Bought this watch a couple of weeks ago. It looks and works great. The band is a little big, but after taking a link out, is wonderful. Needed a watch that had a little weight to it, with a quality band, and this watch has that. Came in a pretty hideously coloured box, but the watch inside is beautiful. No problem recommending this watch for the price."
3,This watch sets itself,I like the watch with the excpetion of the knobs. The main knob somehow becomes loose and the time and date will set itself.
1,Disappointed,"I received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch. Unfortunately the crown wouldn't pull out (to set the date/time) so I returned it immediately. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping (either way) for broken items. I'll probably try again with another Invicta from Amazon."
4,A musical genius slowly awakes from his mental prison.,"I, too (like the first reviewer), was fascinated by the movie ""Shine"" and was eager to know more because it raised a lot of questions for my mental health-trained curiosity. What was his diagnosis? Could his father truly have brought this on or was it physiological? And how did a woman who was not mentally ill come to love a man who exhibited such bizarre behaviors?The author answers a few of these questions and is quite frank about her husband's unusual behaviors.I began to see that the entire story was about an awakening--a man who was in a sort of mental and emotional prison and who began to slowly emerge out of his ""fog.""His musical gift dominated his emergence and surely has been coaxed back into life by the love shared between David and Gillian Helfgott.This is a story that does much to promote tolerance and acceptance of mentally ill persons, and to show us that people don't have to ""have it all together"" to be loved and loving."
1,"Exercrable, patronizing drivel","A friend recommended this book. Since I routinely read 10-15 books per week, I gulped it down . . . only to experience the mental equivalent of heartburn.After I finished the book, I felt sorry for Mr. Helfgott, not because of his emotional problems but because he's apparently married to an overcontrolling, patronizing, astrology lover. I wondered what unexplained dynamics in the relationship gave Mrs. Helfgott the power to decide what her husband should eat, chew, smoke, and do.I also came away from my reading quite perplexed, wondering what Mr. Helfgott's diagnosis was and what occurred during the many years of treatment that are glossed over in the text.I've never seen the movie."
3,"Won't accomodate a 15.4"" laptop","Before I ordered this laptop tote, I researched the size on the manufacturer's website, which says it will accomodate a 15.4"" laptop - NOT! I am soooo disappointed. It's a gorgeous, classy-looking tote, but not big enough for my Lenovo laptop with a 15.4"" screen."
2,Too bad size isn't as advertised,"The padded laptop pocket was at least 1"" smaller than advertised, so my laptop wouldn't fit. Measure your laptop carefully. I was also disappointed that the padded pocket was only padded on one side. I sent it back (for a full refund)and found a similar bag at Wal-mart with a padded, removable case for about $3.00 more AND it had a fuscia interior. Sorry Microsoft! Learn how to read a measuring tape!"
3,18A 1421 Delco Rotor,"In Selecting rotors for this vehicle, I sumized that with the price they would be US made. Amazed at my findings when rec'd that they are made in China. Would of been informative if the description would have stated that information. Surface finish is good, no pulsation on pedal. Will come to a better determination when more mileage is on the vehicle."
3,Not as good as Winning Words.......,"This book was not nearly as good as ""Winning Words"" by the same Author. Many of the quotes were the same as in ""Winning Words"", but they weren't as ""right on"". I've read ""Winning Words"" over and over again because the contents really hit home in the way I live my life."
5,"Learn new language features, deploy smart client networks, and use new forms controls in a workbook packed with examples","Time-saving tips for software developers and Visual Basic users also reside in Matthew MacDonald's Visual Basic 2005: A Developer's Notebook productivity is the emphasis here, with tips on restoring the missing features such as compile-and-run which were active in the previous version of Visual Basic. Learn new language features, deploy smart client networks, and use new forms controls in a workbook packed with examples."
4,Good Beta 2 Overview,"This book contains some great examples covering a wide variety of topics. Major pluses include complete walkthroughs, concise code blocks focusing only on the pertinent lines, and a clear narrative. My opinion on the weaknesses are below, but recommend to all as a great start!Minuses include mentioning some features as new when they are already in 1.1 (""AndAlso"" mentioned as a new feature) and that the book may try to cover too much ground in one place."
1,Way too top heavy,"This whole series of books was written like a comic book. I feel like the author tried to target 13 year old boys with this style of writing. One of the great appeals of the World of Darkness is that you never know what's going on around you. The methuselahs are supposed to be shady characters whom you never see and may not actually exist. In these books, almost a dozen of them are running around. The younger vampires are more common than normal people in the story. The characters were often one dimensional and stereotypical. If you want to buy a comic book with no pictures, get this series. Otherwise, take a pass."
4,Delightful Read,"Similar to works by Charles De Lint, this book explores the entanglements of myth and reality. A girl inherits her great-aunt's house and discovers a door into the summerland. There she learns of an unpublished manuscript by her aunt which threatens the integrity of both worlds. While the writing never reaches the deep insights or the lyrical prose of De Lint's work, it has a simple freshness and likeable characters which make it a perfect weekend read."
4,I know the author....,"....but I'll try to be objective anyway. The story line was cute, although some of the ideas seem a little too familiar (the concept of writing in the human world affecting the fairy world- anyone here see ""The Neverending Story""?). I thought the story flowed well to a perhaps predictable conclusion. Character development was not as strong as it could have been, but still better than I've seen from a lot of more ""experienced"" writers. Bottom line is: if Rebecca's first effort produces this well, I can't wait to see her third, fourth and beyond!"
3,An OK Example of Urban Fantasy,"I adore urban fantasy and read tons of it. This book is not a very good example of the genre. It recycles many tropes from other books and doesn't deal with them in interesting or unusual ways. Our heroine inherits a library from her grandmother, discovers a gateway into faery, it turns out her grandmother was murdered and our heroine must solve the mystery in order to prevent untold chaos and crappiness. This has been done way better by other authors such as Charles De Lint (The Little Country) or Tanya Huff (Gate of Darkness, Circle of Light). This book was not offensive, but it certainly wasn't great."
3,"Nice, light reading","A simple story with simple language. The idea of the world of fairy and the real world merging is not new, but the story is entertaining. The characters are not deeply developed, but likable. I had no trouble putting this book down when it was time to go to work, but it was enjoyable. No deep thinking involved, just a relaxing read."
1,Shockingly Lame,"I am a great fan of character fantasy where the novel features one main hero or heroine and generally sticks to his or her point of view. It gives a unique bias that you can only find inside another persons' head. Unfortunatley, the main character of Eccentic Circles, Piper, has no definete opinion on anything throughout the whole plot except to say, ""Oh my, I'm confused and upset."" Piper lacks the conviction of a real personalitiy and therefore the entire story comes off as lame, weak, and underdeveloped. With no real goals or emotion, Piper ambles through a mystical world and has virtually no reaction except to giggle and the horribly cliche comic releif. If you were reccommended this book after reading such dynamic novels such as ""Daughter of the Forest"", ""War of the Oaks"", or ""Kushiel's Dart"", do not waste your time with this book. While faintly amusing, it does not measure up to the greater works."
2,Reader General's Warning: This book may contain...,"...Flat characters. Punctuation and grammar mistakes that would make my old English teachers cringe. And worst of all, a mystery whose solution is obvious from almost the very beginning, though the main character remains oblivious until it's almost too late.Charles de Lint raves in the cover blurb, but _Eccentric Circles_ never achieves the power and luminosity of which de Lint is capable. I'll give Lickiss the automatic star, plus one more because it's her first novel. I'll read her next one, most likely, and I will hope it is better."
3,Iron Maiden's original vocalist and one of his bands live.,"On South American Assault-Live, Paul Dianno demonstrates that he has a truly great heavy metal voice (strong and rough). An excellent choice of great old Iron Maiden songs appears on this cd, but I'm dissapointed that there isn't more Battlezone material included. Dianno has moved on from Iron Maiden and has a decent body of work since; he should have shown more of it off on this live effort. Sound quality isn't bad, but the crowd noise seems a bit weak, like the shows weren't too crowded. Dianno can deliver the goods live though, and this cd isn't a bad addition to your cd collection if you're into ""classic"" heavy metal."
3,Too Dark,"I ordered this to paint my old existing brass lights. I used a primer and sprayed this on and you can barely tell any gold is in the paint. It is very dark and just looks black, not oil rubbed bronze."
3,A little dark,"I would not say it's look like Oil rubbed bronze color, more like darker color. This is the closet one I can find at this time. Not favorite spray painting color."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This spray paint is basically flat black for a metal product. It was more costly than Home Depot and it is readily available at quite a few stores, so an online purchase was not necessary."
3,The price is way out of line!,"The price was way out of line. And I wish someone could explain why if I wanted two, I would have to pay shipping twice. What a rip-off! Local stores sold it much cheaper."
5,Beautiful color,The previous reviews were right! This is a beautiful color. I used it to spray some ceiling medallions to match the oiled bronze lighting we're installing. Just enough metalic glints to give it the bronze tone. Dark & beautiful.
5,perfect color,Looked every where and no one had on the shelf. Worth waiting for it to arrive. Its the perfect oil rubbed bronze color I wanted to match other decor. Thanks Amazon for having it in stock!
4,Nice color but not bronze,"This is supposed to be bronze, not at all. More like blk with gold glitter. Even still its pretty and does the job but dnt tnk I'll buy again."
2,Satin Nickle?,"I normally love Rust-Oleum products. However, tried out this satin nickle paint - and is typical great Rust-Oleum quality - except it doesn't look anything like satin nickle. After some research it appears there is only one product out there that will give a real satin nickle finish - and that company will not sell it to you unless you take a $2500 class. I would call this color - grey/gold metal flake. Yuck."
2,gold spraypaint,"I spraypainted some boat cleats that I purchased in order to decorate my son's room with a nautical theme. I wasn't thrilled with the color. To me it just looks like gold spraypaint, I did not notice any metallic quality in the sheen."
4,Excellent history,"I just finished re-reading this - again. It's really too bad it's out of print, as there are few works that can match its knowledge and analysis. The only drawback for me is the frequent use of rather silly characterizations: emotional singing reflects the singer's ""Italian heritage,"" or reference to the ""coldness of Northern European singing,"" or the many references to ""manly"" singing/voices. Though written from the perspective of an earlier generation, there really is no excuse for this kind of writing. Get past that, though, and the rest is just great; I find it particularly valuable in helping to assess the current crop of singers."
5,Picked it up at the store and just watched it with my kids!,"The new Larryboy is terrific! The message that greed and never-ending materialism can lead to unhappiness is such a helpful and necessary lesson. Thanks Big Idea for continuing to help parents do their job while entertaining the whole family at the same time. My kids and I were laughing uproariously at the zany humor and super silly dialogue. Hooray for Noodle Blabberbop and his Toy Sheep!PS: The bonus short ""A Polar Pickle"" has a classic cartoon look and feel. Love it!"
5,Young new Talent,"I have had the privledge of listening to this group play live and the sounds are just as good as the CD. Many groups are unble to provide live music with the same sound and quality as a recorded CD - Well, this young and very very talented group of men are able to do so. I would highly recommend Peligro to play for weddings, anniversaries, birthday parties, and for your own listening pleasure. Listening to the first CD release by Peligro was great. The music makes you want to get up and dance as each song plays. If you get a chance listen to the music - I'm sure you won't be disappointed & it'll be well worth you time. Peligro - Which means Dangerous - just what the group is."
5,Is it live or is it Peligro!,"Hello, from West Texas. I have finally listened to Peligro's CD and found it as amazing as a live performance. I was very impressed by their sound both live and on CD. Their music has quite a different sound than everyone else on the charts. They don't carry the traditional ""conjunto"" sound, but they make a music all their own that makes them unique. I recommend that everyone see a live performance to be able to appreciate their music even more than just listening to it on CD. They really put their heart into their music, as I could also tell on their CD. My two favorite songs are COMO AMIGOS and ANTES QUE TU. Their two releases, ZUMBALE MARIA and BAILA CONMIGO have become very popular here in West Texas, which goes to show their variety reaches all walks of life. These talented young men are well on their way to a great career in Tejano music."
5,Awesome Dance music,I love this CD. Peligro really knows how to make you dance. I love the variety of music and the cumbias are awesome. I can't wait for their next release.
4,Solid Album,"Overall Great cd!Not alot of filler here.Lil Rob brings the Old School flavor.I feel the Strongest tracks are Barely getting by,Linda Mujer,Drinking in my driveway,I remember.If youre a fan of chicano rap you cant miss with this one!not heavy on cussing or violent lyrics.I m from California and this cd takes me back to those times."
5,Lil Rob still makin hits a decade later.,"Lil Rob has been the game for over a decade and he is still droppin firme rolas. With his latest record, Lil Rob The Album, he brings oldies as well as old school. My favorite songs on the album are Brought Up In A Small Neighborhood,Barely Gettin By, Ms.Brown, and Street Dayz.Lil Rob is the number one Chicano rap artist!"
4,alot better than capone,i listen to a few latin rap albums and lil rob is clearly the best of latin rap the beats are tight and the lyrics are ok.but alot better than capone.
5,Fun fun fun!,Our new wet and wild tube has been lots of fun for six boys from Texas this summer. They all fit on it just fine and flew off it just fine also. Excellent purchase price and it came very quickly.
3,What I received was not what is shown,"I was hoping to get what was pictured. the original Flyer, 250 cm. the one I received is the new on, slighly smaller. I liked the old one due to the handles on the mid to rear section. these were used to assist with getting it up in a wheelie position. Oh well. I know the old one is discontinued, but thought someone might have a few left over."
4,Great tube,"Have had this for a couple of years now and it is a lot of fun. Best either with 2-3 riders whipping side to side or with one rider that gets airborne (actually the tube goes on edge, sometimes with a foot or two of air). Big deck is good for younger riders, but don't go too fast or the tube will rear up. This is a big favorite of the teens in the family. Only knocks are that it's really big and heavy to transport and that it's hard to keep the valve aligned with the cover."
2,"Wrong Model, picture was incorrect","I was looking for the wet'n'wild pictured. I even called and they assured me it was it. When it came it was a different, smaller tube. Part of this is sportsstuff's fault, they use the same model number with different sized tubes. The seller wasn't super-easy to work with, since it was so large I'd be paying a huge shipping fee, so I just kept it. It's a great tube, shipped fast, too bad it wasn't what I asked for."
5,love it!!!,"Works great, and looks real real good, I am using it on a 27' Daytona and it fits like a glove and best part no holes to drill!!!"
4,Sunny Days,"works great on my 20ft bow rider, makes hanging out in the sun a joy, should work as well on the beach"
4,A Valuable Resource,"Jana Riley has compiled commentary and interpretations on each card from 14 Tarot writers (plus herself) so you can quickly look up a card and get 15 different perspectives on it when you're not sure what it might be saying in a particular context. The authorities included are: Angeles Arrien, Norma Cowie, Aliester Crowley, Pamela Eakins, Gail Fairfield, Mary Greer, Vicki Noble, Rachel Pollack, Jana Riley, Juliet Shurman-Burke, RJ Stewart, AE Waite, Barbara Walker, Dr James Wanless, and Oswald Wirth. I have found that Fairfield tends to be way out in left field, and Wanless & Riley are sometimes questionable, but overall this book is an invaluable reference and should be part of any Tarot student's library. ...Because it _IS_ an entire Tarot library, digested in one volume."
2,Fotune -telling by tarot cards,"I was hoping for modern methods for reading tarot. If I live 100 years ago, this would be great. Its set up , as an opinion of different readers, with suggestions of what they mean. I been reading for 40 years . I always want to keep up to date. This is so old school."
4,This plane is neat,"This electric RC float plane is similar to a Wilga 2000 float plane with some variations, most notably in the cowl shape and in the elevator design. This plane is nicely made, easily assembled and can be ready to fly within a couple of hours if you're mechanically inclined. It is not ready to fly out of the box so do not be fooled by the title of this product. Assembly and adjustment are required. Also note that the aileron servo needs to be moved to the horizontal position before being hooked to the push rods. This can be done by unscrewing the control arm and re-attaching it in the correct position, but be careful removing it. Have fun following the directions. :) My box was missing the wing screws, and the plastic ends for the push rods are flimsy, connect with caution. Other than that, have fun!"
1,piece of crap,the plane felt very cheap during asemble and the programing of the remote was tricky since the plane spazs out randomly and goes full throttle out of controll. you can buy a better float plane for a better price some where else for sure.
1,Terrible experience,"The propeller it comes with and the spare one, got broken on the first and second try (never got off the ground).The worst experience I've had with an RC plane. I don't recommend this plane at all!!"
4,Wish I'd had this the last time I visited Hogtown...,"... you can bet I'll have it with me when I go back. The usual Streetwise quality is evident in this map; the only quibble I have with it is the rather odd orientation. Thanks to the fact that all Streetwise have to fit into their standard rectangle shape, and the somewhat unusual shape of Toronto means that in order to fit it in, it has to be oriented with north nowhere near ""up"". Once you get used to that, though, you have a dandy, sturdy map of Toronto, including the TTC subway lines."
2,not that useful for downtown,"Didn't even take this map on my trip. Not as useful as the map included with purchase inside Frommer's Toronto 2011. Since laminated, might be useful if caught in the rain without an umbrella."
4,Great as textbook,"This was a recommended textbook for my environmental health class as a public health student. For someone who took this course not because I was extremely interested, but because it was required, this book did a great job of summarizing the consequences of environmental exposure on health while keeping it pretty interesting and without getting bogged down in inconsequential details. I kept it at the end of class and refer to it from time to time."
1,Horrible Service,Book never arrived and seller never responded to any emails regarding the purchase. Eventually I had to contact Amazon directly and get my money back. Amazon was wonderful but this seller was terrible. Be prepared to be unsatisfied!
1,This takes the passion right out of U2...It is a BAD tribute,"As a veteran die-hard U2 fan of over almost 20 years; all I had to do was listen to the previews provided here by Amazon.com. This is a tribute that puts the real passion behind Bono's voice and the U2 lyrics to shame. They REALLY KILLED the songs. Most of all they made my skin crawl to even here the ways they sang the songs. My all time fave U2 song ""With or Without You"" when Bono sings it brings tears to my eyes his voice is so beautiful. This guy on this tribute did the same; it was tears of pain and my ears hurt too. This is a BAD tribute. No pun intended using the word ""BAD"" which of course die hard U2 fans know is a U2 song. Please do not for the love of U2 buy this recording. It is not at all worth it."
1,"Oh my god, what have I done?","Being a really devoted U2 fan, I was ordering some tribute cd's off of amazon.com. I saw this and thought it was worth spending money on...never have I ever been so wrong. The cd is so horribly done, the songs are extremely bland and hollow. Makes sense, they were mixed and produced in a garage. Nothing in this cd is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as U2. Listening to the real thing is so much better than listening to a couple of other guys (songs are all sang by either some guy named kyle or david or army of halfwits, no kidding) who butcher u2's beautiful sound. I am so incredibly dissapointed."
2,Orginally titled Mesmerized,"This movie was orginally titled Mesmerized and was a 1984 movie. While I don't recall it being released in theatres, it is out on video and now DVD under the name Shocked. It is a strange twisting plot, but the acting of Foster and Lithgow is, as usually, very good.All in all, though, I'd have to say it is not one of their best works, but if you are a fan of either, it is worth viewing."
3,Not totally horrible...,"I got this DVD at the Dollar Tree for $1 and so went in not expecting much from it. I was pleasantly suprised by it being better than I expected it to be... I like Jodie Foster, which is the reason I bought it and watched it. I think she did a good job for what she had to work with, which was a pretty dull script. The costuming and sets were all pretty top notch, as was most of the acting. John Lithgow, who played her husband, did a good job, in that he gave me the creeps. There was pretty good chemistry between she and her brother in law, making you believe they could be 'in love'. However, I only give it three stars because the editing was not so good, it jumped around too much and didn't explain very well... I am happy I've watched it, but I wouldn't pay more for it than I did."
1,"LAME, LAME, LAME","Thankfully I only paid $1 for this DVD at the Dollar Tree Store. I thought it was a stupid script and stupid movie. First of all, this movie is based in the 1800s and Jodie Foster is introduced to some ol' [...] fellow through the orphanage women where she has been raised in. They marry and this fellow gets off staring at her through a peep hole while she undresses. But the viewer never sees anything whatsoever except for her taking off like 2 underskirts and she still has the clothes piled on her. Then we see him getting off as she trims his nose hairs and his eyes are rolling to the back of his head in arousement. Took everything I had to sit through it since I did not want to let my $1 go to waste but I should have. 94 minutes of my life wasted. UUGGHH!!!!"
1,worst headset,"it's worst headset among I have used ever. It has amazing noice. it's comfortable. but it's first time to hear this kind of noise. When I volume up, it sounds like that when I turned wrong TV chennel. I had to buy Sony. I really regret buying it."
1,I haven't tryed it yet,"I was so exited to buy a wireless headphones. This product had every thing except the important part, and its the Bluetooth Transmitter.The problem is, the box have an empty space for the Bluetooth Transmitter but they want you to buy it. What worse than that they didn't write it down so the buyer know that this product doesn't have a Bluetooth Transmitter.I called them, and they say you can buy the Bluetooth Transmitter from us now! and its just 34$.Sorry, I was disappointed buying this product. Some friends say iLuv is not the best for headphones."
5,shield rules!,"this record is awesome.every song is really a masterpiece i must say.if you are into outspoken, lifetime, and so on, this is the album for you!a real positive bonus is the ballad-song called 24 hours of sunshine!!! :)go buy it!"
2,Everything but lessons,"If you are looking for double bass lessons, definitely this is not the dvd you need. It's more like a preview of several hudson music dvd's, but you can only see a couple minutes of performances. Nothing awesome in this item."
2,ok,"this dvd is something that i wasnt trill about , this is a dvd perfect for people that are advance in drums and that are also play with double bass."
4,Double Bass Drumming - Great Video,"Performances were incredible but as a single bass player learning to integrate the double bass into my playing I learned a lot from the following performances and clinicians.Simon Phillips - Fusion drummer; great dynamics and Left Hand DrummingRuss Miller - Session drummer; sixteenth note tripletsJason Bittner - technique to build speed (beats per minute bpm), power and precision along with exercises to strenghen left and right foot equally.Thomas Lang - stick control hand exercises and drills transfered to the feet with accents. Amazing single and double stroke rolls (32nd notes)on a single bass drum."
2,not exactly what I expected,If you've read any other baby book then the info in this book will not be any different. It reminds me of a college essay - waste of time for me.
4,Hands free cell phone use,"I didn't need an expensive or wireless hands free product for my cell phone while driving. Just wanted something simple to make sure my eyes stayed on the road for safety. While the ear buds are a little large for my ears, I can hear my calls fairly well, and the microphone works great. The microphone also has a button which allows call to be made with spoken instructions. Recommended for an inexpensive way to keep your eyes on the road while talking on your cell phone."
2,Handsfree headset,I did not receive the item number I ordered so it does not work on my phone. It cost me $5 something and it's not worth the hassle to call and figure out how to send it back.
1,Headsets were crap,"I ordered three of the Motorola headsets and they were completely useless. The first worked for a few days, but not well, then it stopped working altogether. The second only had sound in one ear and I haven't bothered to use the third, what's the point? The purchase was a complete waste of money; basically I was ripped off!"
4,Unbelievable!,"I ordered this microwave yesterday 4/25/06 in the afternoon. It was delivered to me before Noon today 4/26/06. Now THAT is unbelievable!It is a beautiful microwave. There was a small indentation in the metal top back corner, but this poses no problem to me. However, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.The clock was a breeze to set and the sensor made popcorn that my husband judged,""...the best I ever had!""I've had 4 microwaves in my lifetime and this is by far the best looking! I bet it will be the best ""cooking"" too!Thanks!"
2,Sharp Carousel Microwave Black w/stainless,"I bought this microwave not even a year ago from target for $88. Considering what it's going for now, I suppose I got a good deal, except for the fact that it broke already.Turntable was always horrible, it worked when it felt like it.As for defrosting, it would always wind up ""cooking"" the edges of meat and chicken.When you try to follow a recipe for microwave: forget about it! It would always overcook and everything would wind up ""popping"" and being all over the inside!Was pretty noisy as microwaves go as well.I guess I got what I paid for.But it sure looks pretty."
2,Disappointing,"I was taking the Princeton Review and thought that I should get in extra practice with the Kaplan tests. I bought this CD thinking I would get a good representation of the test itself, along with some practice. It was horrible compared to princeton! The lessons didn't let you move at your own pace, the tests themselves were ridiculously hard, and the program had trouble loading on my computer the first few times. The tests are NOT indicative of the actualy GMAT. It's much harder -in a bad way. It kind of kills your confidence. I scored a good 120 on the actual test over what I got on the Kaplan one. Save your money and buy the official guide review! The book has tons of questions that you would actually see on the test."
4,Virgil Bliss,"What an incredible film! I loved Virgil from the opening right up to the violent moment of his undoing. What a powerful film. This is one of those movies you want to share with all the intelligent, thoughtful people you know. Virgil is a real person and we want him to have the life he so desperately searches for once he's been released from prison. Yet fate, or circumstance, or just dumb luck haunt him in the forms of Manny, the first ""friend"" Virgil makes on the outside, the halfway house ""counselor"" who is mostly concerned with showing his macho stuff, a society demanding that Virgil make it on his own but then won't allow him the most basic snese of self-determination, and an overall system programmed not to care. Virgil could have made it, and that is the tragedy of his story. Incredible performances all around but especially Clint Jordan as Virgil. If you crave excellent films that demand your full attention but then require you to come up with the answers, Virgil Bliss is for you."
1,Unreliable Software,My company has had the unfortunate experience of running ICVerify for credit card processing for almost a year now. We have used both stand-alone and multi-user configurations. During that time the software has been extremely unreliable. Workstations seem to lose their configurations for no known reason and have to be reconfigured at random. Tech support tries to be helpful but they typically just go through all the steps that I have done over and over again. Often the software has to be completely removed and reinstalled again (and again and again...).I would never purchase this software again. It has been nothing but trouble.
5,My baby,"After a lot of research I settled on this film camera and it has not let me down. Great product, easy to use, a fantastic buy, I've had this camera for about 9 months and I love it more every time I use it."
5,Best out of 3,I purchased 3 dvds and this one is by far the best. Ladies in the dvd aren't too chipper or too boring. Its perfect. Love it!
4,I really like it!!!,"I really like this!!! I love that you can do a ""quick"" workout, or the full length! I love Summer, she is so cute, and NORMAL. The only thing I wish is that there was a little more to the workout, but I really like it other than that, and would totally recommend it!!!"
4,Works you!,I would agree that this would be a great video for someone who is already pretty fit. It actually feels like you are working out!
5,Love it!,"This video was exactly what I was looking for. I was a marathon runner pre pregnancy but was having a hard time keeping up with my running. This DVD gets me moving, is challenging but not too much so. Summer's attitude is upbeat and positive."
5,"Easy workout, Sanders is fun!","Easy to follow, such that you will feel that you can do it and will do it. Love her energy. I do it about 2 a week in my last trimester, and about 1 a week during the 2nd trimester, and didn't do it at all during my 1st trimester(cuz I was too tired with morning sickness). They are broken down in 3 trimester so it's not as boring. A super good ivnestment! Just wish she has a postnatal exercise dvd that I can buy too!"
4,Pretty good workout,"Was looking for a workout to do while pregnant, without going overboard. This did help, but I felt like it didn't push me hard enough. I barely felt like I had worked out after I did the video. Basically used it as a warm-up and then found some exercises in another pregnancy book and did those after ""warming-up"" with the DVD. Would probably be best for someone who has found out they are pregnant and wants to do just enough to kind of get by. I've worked out for several years before becoming pregnant and just felt this didn't challenge me like I would have liked for it to."
3,Not for a beginner,I enjoyed the exercises but they were more intense then I was looking for. I couldn't do all the squats and push ups. For the more advanced.
3,"good workout, ANNOYING lady","The workouts are great; could use a little more variety if this is something i am going to do a few times a week. I really liked the stuff with the resistance band. Unfortunately, Summer Sanders is SO annoying as a smug pregnant lady trying too hard to be self - deprecating. It was especially offensive when she started complaining about her ""chicken wing"" arms (alluding to saggy upper arms) and pointing to her toned triceps. I myself have been in the fitness industry for 13 years and a BIG no - no is displaying a negative body image to clients. Fitness should be empowering. People don't come to you to hear you complain about your imagined flaws, they want to be inspired and empowered. I think i'll just start to do the workout with the sound off, so she doesn't annoy the crap out of me each time."
5,Great for all trimesters!,"I got this workout video during my second trimester, which was awesome because I hadn't been able to find anything that actually still made me feel like I was working out with out going overboard. I love the fact that all I need is a resistance band and some pillows for the video and the work out is easy to remember so even if I don't have it with me, I can still get in a good 30 minutes of exercise during the day!"
3,"Not a Bad Workout, but a Little Dull","This workout isn't bad, and the instructors' commentary keeps things light and humorous. However, I found there to be a lack of variety and too much repetition of many of the exercises. I recommend sampling it first before purchasing to see if it's right for you. It is pretty low-impact and probably good for someone who wants some simple, light exercise."
5,Love this DVD,"This is a fantastic DVD. I love that it has different workouts for each trimester and a long and short version of each. The workouts are challenging, but doable even now that I am in my 8th month. Summer and Kerri are upbeat and easy to follow. I supplement the DVD with walking and pre-natal yoga and I am still feeling great!"
4,Great Video,This DVD is really good for home use or if you travel!! I really like that there are different workouts for each trimester because your capabilities change during different stages of pregnancy. Summer and her sister in law (the trainer) are fun to watch and the excercises are fun and work a lot of different muscle groups. It also has a longer video 60 min and an express video 30 min.
3,Just OK,"There are some worthwhile exercizes, but overall this DVD is not my favorite. Summer Sanders is not a fitness instructer. She made the DVD with her sister in law who is a fitness instructer, but you can tell that prenatal fitness is not their main business. They have you move from back and forth from standing to chair to floor excercizes constantly during the video which I find unecessary. Also, the long workout is the same as the express workout, they just repeat the express workout. Keep in mind they use excercize bands for some of the excercises, so you will need to have or buy those as well. I also bought 10 minute prenatal pilates, which I like because you can customize your workout to be anywhere from 10 to 50 minutes, which is great when you are on a busy schedule."
5,Best Pregnancy Workout DVD!,"I am 11 weeks pregnant and have done this workout 2 times after receiving it last week. I am used to doing Beach Body's Insanity, I was doing that for the last 5 months before I got pregnant, great workout! So after getting pregnant I decided I should do less intense exercises. This DVD is the best, I love it. It works out your entire body without making you feel like your dying. It has a workout for each trimester which is also really great. Summer and her sister-in-law make a very entertaining pair as they workout. I would highly recommend this to anyone, I will be telling all of my many friends who are pregnant! I also got the ""best pregnancy"" dvd and I do not like that one as much, the girl never talks and it's just weird. But, I was sore after it both. I think this one is just more fun."
4,Enjoyable,"This is my first pregnancy, and first prenatal DVD. I really appreciate that she has this video broken into a workout for each trimester, and that there is an express & full length workout version (though I've not used the express workout yet). I find Summer to be down to earth, and energetic without being annoying. My only complaint at all, is that I wish there was an additional workout option for days when you really have alot of energy. I am in my second trimester now, and find myself doing step-ups as I follow the arm excersizes on the video, just to add a little extra work for myself. I do like the length of the workouts though- I think they run 45 minutes or so for the full length version."
4,Great DVD for Workouts during Pregnancy,"I found that others reviews of this product was favorable, so I thought I'd buy it and check it out. I like that it has a different routine for each exercise. The exercises are hard enough that you feel like you're getting a workout, but no so hard that you can't catch your breath. Summer is very pregnant during the video, so it makes you feel like if she can do it and be upbeat about it, I can too. There is also a longer version and ""express"" version for each trimester. I found that the longer version is just a repeat of the same exercises you did in the express workout."
4,good toning workout,"i enjoyed the dvd, but i wish it had some cardio. i ordered two dvds this one and the denise austin one. neither was what i was expecting, but i definitely thought this was the better of the two."
3,"Annoying, but it works you out.","I like the workouts in the video, but Summer and Keri's conversation is annoying. I really don't like the music either. I only watched the video as much as I needed in order to get the routine down, then copied it on paper and exercise without it now. I can go at my own pace that way, too.My last pregnancy did not end to well because I strained my rib muscles on the right side doing a workout. That put me into labor at 34 weeks. So, to anyone who exercises during pregnancy, please use caution! If you feel something weird (especially in or around the abdominal cavity), REST it, DON'T OVER DO IT, DON'T WORK THROUGH IT!Overall, the work outs are good ones. They are challenging and make me feel stronger and fitter. They would even be good for women who are not pregnant. If the conversation was more professional and the music less irritating, I would happily give this video 5 stars."
4,Nice Workout,"I really like that this video offers a different excercise option for each trimester of pregnancy. However I hadn't read all the reviews and I wish I had because the video description doesn't tell you that you'll need a resistance band for alot of the excercises. So other then needing the band I'm enjoying this video, also the 2 ladies in it aren't as irritating as I've found others to be:)"
4,Challenging Prenatal Workout,"I was pretty in shape prepregnancy. I ran a few times a week and lifted weights, although mostly focusing on my upper body. This DVD was quite a challenge for me, though! I began by only doing the shortened version (30 minutes with warm up and cool down). I was sore for 2 days afterward. I really felt like a I was getting a workout. After a few sessions of the 30 minute workout I stepped it up to the full length (60 minute) workout. It is still a challenge for me, but it feels great. There is a great combination of legs, back, arms, and abs that makes for a complete workout. My only complaint is that the 60 minute workout is basically a repeat of the 30 minute workout. You do two cycles of the same workout."
5,Will kick your butt!,"This is the best out there, especially since it has different workouts for each trimester. It is a little boring, I wish it was more fun and exciting but you can't really beat this work out. I am in my first trimester and I am going on day 3, and you WILL feel it! I am so sore and I know this will help me during this pregnancy to stay in shape. Highly recommend."
4,Good basic video...,"I like that there are three different workouts (one for each trimester)...the exercises are pretty basic (a lot of squats and some band work). So, not extremely challenging, but it will keep you moving. I thought Summer's personality was pleasant (I tend to get annoyed at overly-enthusiastic instructors on some of these videos!!)"
4,Good video,"This is a good video, and I like that it breaks it down by trimesters. The workouts are hard, but do-able."
3,ok video.,"I suppose this video is what it's supposed to be--a fairly relaxed video for pregnant women! it does give you a decent strength workout for your arms and legs, but i was disappointed that there really is no cardio involved. Summer can be slightly annoying, but overall it's on ok pregnancy workout. i use this to supplement other workouts, since this one has no cardio."
4,Decent workout,"I started using this video in my 2nd trimester so I never did the 1st trimester. However, I'm now done the 2nd and 3rd trimester workouts. It's a decent workout...not too overly stimulating but certainly better than not doing anything. I'd say my biggest complaint is that while it's great that Summer has a trainer with her to assist her..I do not. So I find that while her trainer is setting up her pillows for her next exercise, or getting her water all while Summer's working out, I keep having to pause the dvd in order to do those things myself. Not a huge deal, but certainly something that has annoyed me enough to mention."
4,Great pregnancy workout,"This workout video is great for pregnant mothers who are used to working and find themselves unable to keep up with the same level of activity prior to finding out they were pregnant. Summer challenges you to work all areas of your body, to the level of intensity that you feel comfortable, but doesn't ""over due it"" so that you're sore the next day. The workouts in this video also allow you to switch up what you want to get out of them. They are divided up by trimester and it would be nice if there was several workouts to choose from for each trimester!"
5,I Love these Tapes!,These workout tapes are currently a great tool for me as I go through my pregnancy. I wanted to keep working out the way I did pre-pregnancy and learned very quickly that it is harder than I thought. These tapes are a great supplement to a current exercise regime or by themselves. I love being able to workout in my living room on those days I don't feel so great about going to the gym.
5,Fabulous gift!!!,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who is pregnant with twins. She sent me a note thanking me for the gift of healthy babies. Because she stayed fit, her delivery was relatively easy and she looks great! This DVD is a MUST for anyone special to you who is pregnant."
3,"Not bad, but a bit boring","I was a little bit disappointed with this workout after reading all the other positive reviews. The workout starts with a good warm up, but then the main part of the workout consists of alternating squats/lunges with various types of reps using the resistance band. Ok workout, but pretty boring. THEN, in the extended workout they just repeat the exact same workout (squats & reps) AGAIN! It was boring enough the first time! I wonder what was the point of making an extended workout (about 50 min in total) when they couldn't think of enough different material to fill the time. I also skip the ab work section which is basically crunches on an incline because I am worried about making my abdominal seperation worse.If you are just looking to buy one prenatal workout dvd, I would recommend Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix - it is a really fun and energizing aerobic workout and the time just flies by when you are doing it."
2,So annoying!,"Given the many positive reviews for this dvd, I was expecting a bit more. Although the dvd gives you variability in workouts depending on your trimester, I found Summer Sanders to be extremely annoying. She constantly prattles on about ""your booty"" and other such nonsense which is a huge detractor. I wish she came with a mute button! I found myself becoming more and more irritated through my workout and often turned off the dvd player before being done. If you can, rent this dvd through your local library before purchasing to see if you can tolerate Summer enough to stomach her on a regular basis."
5,Totally worth the money,"I actually bought this DVD without reading any of the reviews on it. I got it on sale for $6.00 used and I must say it was totally worth the money! After going through 3 other prenatal exercise tapes I found that especially in the third trimester (when I started this) the workouts were challenging enough but also allowed me to rest. The other DVD's I had bought tended to either have very annoying trainers (how can a trainer who is not pregnant at the time relate to me? And why can't they just shut up?)In this DVD I really enjoyed all the workouts and the squats really helped me. Furthermore, before I got this DVD I was getting back pains and I swear it was this DVD which kept me from all the last trimester pains. I'm right now in my last month and still working out to this DVD."
5,GREAT VIDEO!,This is the perfect video for all 4 trimesters. It's fun and adaptable and really gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it!
5,Not EASY,"This is my third pregnancy workout video and by far my favorite. I'm in my second trimester and finally had to give up running last week as it was just too uncomfortable. I continue to walk as much as possible but wanted something more - this video is it. Coming from someone who exercises regularly, this workout is not easy. My other videos are only about 20 minutes long and left me feeling like I hadn't done anything - not this one. The second trimester workout is a full 50 minutes long and challenging, left me sore the next day!"
1,I HATE this video,"You cannot skip right to the workouts, that and the fact that the music sounds like Indian techno, makes this video VERY annoying. The workout itself is pretty good, but the fact that you have to go through 2 minutes of ads before getting to it really pi$$es me off. Don't buy it."
2,Prenatal workout,I was looking for a pilates prenatal workout for my daughter and was not impressed by this workout as it is only a general workout not what I was looking for. I would recommend readers look for a Pilates prenatal workout which is much better as it prepares you for easy delivery.
3,Too much,"This video was mostly squats and lunges. I only did the second trimester workout, but I couldn't even do half of the squats and lunges they want you to do and I still couldn't walk for three days. I would say don't get this if you're not already super fit."
3,Good,"I do like this workout. It's the best pregnancy one I have so far for toning. I have two small problems with it. First, I wish there was more cardio. There is a little cardio and a lot of toning. So I mix a pregnancy dvd that has cardio with it on opposite days because I felt like I was just bulking up in my legs. Second, I do agree with what some others have said about Summer talking a bit too much. She talks quite a bit, mainly just ramble, and you have to hear the same thing every time you workout with it. But if you can tune her out and find another way to get cardio then you will be just fine with this DVD."
2,"Slow, Summers annoying","I do not understand how this dvd gets such good reviews. I have been working out regularly for over a year and am only six weeks along and this video was pretty much a waste of money for me. There is no cardio and in the beginning you don't even get a decent warmup before they start having you stretch. Summer Sanders is super annoying and is basically like ""look at me trainer"" when the trainer is trying to show modifications of the exercise. I will keep this in my rotation for a variation on toning exercises, but I need a video that is cardio and toning in one. I don't have time to work out for hours a day. I recommend Erin O' Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix for more advanced exercisers."
5,A PREGNANCY MUST HAVE!!!!,"If you are pregnant, you CAN NOT go without this video. Keri and Summer have a wonderful way of capturing what is important throughout each trimester. (each semester comes with a different workout) super helpful. Being a second time mother, their express workout fits in wonderfully with our hectic schedule. The full workout is wonderful, when daddy is around. Knowing that both of these women are mothers themselves, and seeing the shape that they are in.....is definately a huge motivator!(wow...Keri!) If you are pregnant, or know of anyone that may be pregnant in the future..... THIS IS THE GIFT TO HAVE! Thanks for putting out such a great video!"
2,Irritating,"I bought this DVD due to all the rave reviews. Sadly, I found it to be annoying. The workout was good but the music bothered me and Summer Sanders is much too chatty. The setting of a large cold living room made me feel uncomfortable. I prefer a more relaxing workout with calming music and professional instructors. I love this one:Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga"
4,Pretty good workout.,I like this workout video. For the first half of my pregnancy though it was not very challenging. I have almost all of Jillian Michaels workout videos and use these religiously and still used them for my first trimester but as my stomach grew and was not able to keep up with Jillian's pace this DVD worked great.
3,Good enough,"Good enough, but less than expected. One of very few similar dvds that have different workouts for each trimester, but the workout itsself was not good enough, because we were interested more in aerobic exercises."
4,Really like it,"This video is really good, it works out the muscles that need to be prepared for being a mom. I really like Summer's attitude and personality. The only thing is I am getting bored of the same thing everyday. She has one full length work out and one shortened version of the same work out for each trimester. I wish she did a couple different work outs for each trimester. Other than that it's great. Oh you also need to buy a resistance band. I didn't realize this until I had already started the video."
5,You need to buy resistance bands!!,"I love this video and am in my 20th week of pregnancy...opened the DVD last night and did the second trimester ""long"" workout and watched the ""short"" workout. My kids joined me (age 4 and 6) it was fun! The steps are basic and easy to do, but also effective and get your heart rate up...the voices/music were not annoying so I would definetly recommend this for others to buy. The only thing that bummed me out was that 75% of the exercises used a resistance band...I didn't know I needed one for the video and would have bought it earlier if I had known."
2,"So, so ANNOYING!","This has got to be the most annoying workout video I have ever done! I thought Denise Autsin was bad. Summer is so annoying! She talks to her sister-in-law/trainer and thinks she is hilarious. She tries to crack jokes and thinks she is so funny. Her and her SIL's banter is just intolerable.If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I dont have to hear Summer.I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets 2 starts because it is a decent workout. It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts. Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.I cant believe there arent more reviews of annoyed viewers!"
2,Not impressed... not very fluid workout,"I purchased several videos and was the leaast impressed with this video. The instructer was not very fluid with her movements and they did not flow together at all. The movements were sharp and instruction was very poor and uninteresting. It felt like one of those skits from Saturday Night Live, where the women are talking on the radio with very bland voices and tones, but not funny at all. I would definately not recommend this for prenatal workout. Perfect Pregnancy Workouts were my absolute favorite!"
5,Great workouts,"This is actually a really great set of workouts tailored to each trimester, but not so much yoga as it is a workout video, in my opinion! There is an option for a quick workout or a full workout and it is nice to be able to pick which one depending on the time you have. I always feel like I am actually working out instead of just moving or stretching. Just a heads up though, the workouts sometimes require an exercise band (I didn't realize this the first time) so you will need one to get the full benefit. I did find Summer to be a bit distracting, dare I say obnoxious, as she talks over the instructor quite a bit in attempts to be funny but nothing intoralable. I would recommend this exercise DVD if you want to feel like you aren't wasting your time and want to work fairly hard."
3,Ok but room for impovement,The video was ok. It was a nice combination of cardio and toning work. I wish they did more stretching excersizes and described movements/ target areas better during the workout to keep you thinking about the excersizes and not running through the motions. The constant banter is also a little annoying. I only do the workout when my husband is out b/c it drives him nuts. It's a much better workout than 'pregnancy fitness' but not as good as steben's 'the perfect pregnancy workout'
3,Not as challenging....,"I thought this video would be a little more challenging. I'm not looking to lose weight, but did want to feel as if I worked my muscles a bit. I didn't feel a thing the next day. I think this video is good for people that either didn't work-out much pre-pregnancy, or are just looking for a ""light"" work-out during pregnancy."
1,very bad. not professional,They talk too much. Pretty much just a repetition of a few exercises. Not good for moms who used to workvout before. Will not even sweat a bit.
3,Mainly toning during pregnancy,"This workout did not raise my heart rate at all. It was all about toning work. I really disliked the first trimester work, but the second trimester left me aching the next day (in a good way). It is a little annoying when Summer and her trainer talk over each other."
2,boring for me..,"I used to excercise hardly.. so, during pregnancy i got couple of cd workout all are ok but this one isn't interesting so much especially the full lenghth workout.."
3,decent workout,"decent workout; a little redundant. probably good for beginners, but not very challenging for those who exercised before getting pregnant."
3,I'm not a guy!,"Workout is pretty good. I like the 2nd trimester work better than 1st. The workout is not only modified as you progress in your pregnancy but has different activities all together for each trimester. Like other reviewers, I found the music somewhat annoying. Most annoying was the fact that Summer and Keri both repeatedly say ""you guys"" to their audience over the course of the workout. I don't have any men at home doing this workout with me and feel that they could have tailored their speaking to their appropriate audience of pregnant women."
1,horrible workout,"i only bought this dvd because it came up to the top when i entered "" prenatal yoga"". i needed a yoga workout for my trip to france that i could do on my hotel room. i didn't realize that 1. it's not a yoga workout, 2. the dvd starts with a long obnoxious commercial, 3. you need props (bands) to do the exercise and 4. the workout itself it's pretty lame and 5. the instructor is annoying. what a waste! really disappointed that Gaiam would sponsor such a poor quality dvd."
1,Obnoxious Commercials Precede Workout Video - No Chapters,"I just came back from a run with the intent on heading directly into this workout program. I am using the enormous amounts of time that I have while waiting for all of the GAIAM commercials that precede the actual workout to write this review. There are no chapters on this DVD that allow you to skip right to the workout. I wonder how many times I'll have the patience to sit through their ads while waiting to begin my workout. Insanely annoying. Interesting, apparently the chapters aren't available until after you sit through all of their BS commercials. It's so obnoxious. I already bought your product, why must you inundate me with further ads?!???!?!??!"
4,Good workout.,"I purchased the Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout DVD around the end of my second trimester as an alternate workout between the Susanne Bowers Prenatal Workout DVD. I was worried because this DVD received mixed reviews. I liked it. I thought it was a good workout. There were a lot of complaints about the silly comments of Summer Sanders and the reminder to take water breaks, but I didn't mind any of it. In fact I liked the built in water breaks. I like that the DVD is broken down into three different workouts for the three trimesters. Even though I've moved into the beginning of my third trimester I'm still doing the second trimester workout on days when I have a lot of energy. The DVD suggests you have bands for some of the moves, but I didn't have those. I used light 3 lb weights instead and though it was a great substitution. All in all, I think this is a worth while DVD to purchase. Don't let the conversation and water breaks stop you from enjoying the workout."
4,Great DVD!,"This is a great workout for cardio and strength building! The only problem for me is that I get bored of it fairly quickly, so supplementing with another video (Element Yoga is a great one) has been really helpful for me. You can choose to do the full workout, or half of it which is great for those mama's who are still working or who don't have a lot of time. I have not tried other prenatal cardio DVD's , but never felt the need to look for another!"
2,Optimistic but boring,"I wanted to like this DVD, but was annoyed by the Summer and her sister-in-law, they chat the entire time. It is distracting for me. In addition, I thought the moves were repetitive and boring. They do have three different programs for the trimesters, but it's too prosaic for me to sit through them all."
4,Great Workout throughout Pregnancy,"I bought this DVD in my first trimester and have been using it a couple times a week. I think it has made a big difference in my energy levels and strength. Hopefully when I reach my third trimester, I won't have as many aches and pains!"
5,Great Workout Video,"I am currently in my 2nd trimester with my first pregnancy and have bought about 4 prenatal workout videos. I love this one! I feel that the pace is just right for me and I really like using a resistance band. I also like how the video is separated into the different trimesters. Before I got pregnant I would work out about 3 days a week doing weights and mostly walking/jogging. I wasn't an avid workout buff so this may or may not be challenging enough for some people. For me it's perfect and I'm even sore the next day. The only downside is that the ""full workout"" is nothing more than repeating what you did in the express workout. I was hoping it was a little different. Overall, great workout though."
1,Miss leading,This product clams to remove hair but 2 tubes latter i'm still growing a beard complete misleading false clam don't waste your money
1,no no no,I bought a pack of 2 lotions and 2 sprays for my girlfriend. The price was $200 but it wouldn't matter if they were really working. She will never use this product again.
5,A Prime CD,"There are many critics and fans who consider this Phyllis' best, and I certainly put it in the top three. ""Don't Wanna Change the World"" is a catchy dance tune that features Phyllis in a sexy little rap. ""I Found Love"" is a gorgeous ballad, ""When You Get Right Down To It"" is an affirmation of moving on from a bad love affair that is a toe-tapping infectious anthem. ""When I Give My Love"" is a breath-takingly soft song that she builds to a emotional climax, ""Prime Of My Life"" is Phyllis strong and transformed, ""Walk Away"" showcases the sheer power of her voice, but the gem on this CD is ""Meet Me On The Moon"", a personal favorite of Phyllis. This song allows her to use that VOICE to the fullest, weaving a musical journey that lifts you and carries you to a place that is pure Phyllis. You won't want to leave. Buy two copies of this one, one for yourself and one for someone you love."
3,Prime of My Life,A few nice ballads but not as good as the Legacy of Phyllis Hyman Album which I consider her best work regarding songs that made her famous and a legend as a female Jass and Rhythm/Blues Singer .Nestor R. Mantilla
5,Read This Book,"I loved this book when it first came out years ago, and it still makes me laugh, as Jane Austin still makes me laugh. Fay Weldon is one of the few writers I know of who has the wit and the irony that we Austin-lovers look for. Letters to Alice is wise and insightful; read it!"
2,strange movie,"I watched it and thought, this is strange. It wasn't a bad movie, just not what I was expecting. First off, how can a girl that is supposed to be dead doing all this carnage. I don't want to give it away. If you like lots of blood and gore then go ahead a see it."
4,Great alarm clock!,"I purchased this alarm clock because I'm a fan of all Casio products, and it is an amazing clock, and it has cool features as mentioned in its page.But take notice that in its page it was mentioned ""Unisex WATCH""! but it is not a watch!!! it is a big alarm clock of Casio! when I wanted to buy it believing it was a watch, not a clock!"
4,The Odds need more recognition!,This album was introduced to me by a friend (thanx zoo!) and i compleately fell in love eith it. the songs are fun to listen to and really well-crafted. the odds need more US recognition and hopefully they will in the near future becuase of the canadian band craze because of BNL.
4,good transaction,Product came on time. The case was a little banged up and the disc worked after a little cleaning.
4,Old fashion western,"Nice old fashion western.Lots of familiar faces in the cast.(Gary Busey, Jeff Fahey, Adrienne Barbeau, James Hong)With a touch of avenging angel plot.Bandits terrorizing the old west Arizona.Good guys win, bad guys lose.If you like westerns, you'll like this one."
4,Day Trippin !,Excellent accurate book for all songs Beatles ! Intro chords never before found and all in one book.Single biggest complaint is the size of the book. It is difficult to keep it open to any particular page while trying to play and read.Otherwise a great find. I haven't stopped learning the songs from it since I purchased it.
5,Love it.,I was so excited when this came in the mail. It was just what I wanted and needed to learn guitar. Thank you so much!!
5,this is the strum along chord book you are looking for,5 stars not because it is perfect but because it is the best book of its kind. some chord alignment errors but overall great
3,"Complete, but not user friendly","This book IS complete, all the songs are here. The only problem is the binding of this book. It is almost impossible for anyone who is actually USING the book to play songs on the piano or guitar or any other musical instrument that requires two hands in the production of music. A spiral binding on this book would make it MUCH more user friendly. Then the book would stay open and not fall off of a music stand. I bought the book and a friend in the book binding business carefully removed the original binding and put it into a spiral binding. TA-DA, it is now actually a usable book of chords for musicians. If you are just gonna sit on your sofa and look at the chord/words and maybe sing the tunes, then I would give it 5 stars."
1,amature,"For anyone with more than 6 months playing, this book is a ripoff. Way to simplistic and NOT at all true to how the songs were actuallty played. Forget this one."
1,Hal Leonard deceived customers,"On its website, Hal Leonard shows that this book contains piano notes as well as those for guitar and vocal, with a picture showing what its content should be like. Yet in reality, there is no piano notes at all! They simply decievied customers into buying their books, and they are unwilling to apologize! Until now, that mistake still exists in their website. They argued that this book is a ""fake"" book that can be used for piano. What an incredible excuse! Shameless enough. I wonder why such a lousy company can exist till now."
3,Missing Pages,Okay so I'm missing pages 198-216. Are all the books like this? Or can I return it for a book that has all the pages?
2,Was Not Impressed,"Did not like this at all, and would not recommend this to anyone. The layout of the book wasn't that great and I just thought it could have been done better by the best band ever."
2,Disappointing...,"True to its title, it is just a chord book. Chords and lyrics, nothing else. I would have liked something that had some picking and strumming techniques as well, but I can't honestly say there is anything about the book or the way it was packaged that indicated it would be more. My only question is, why? Why bother putting out a book that is so sparse on content, when there are plenty of books out there with much much more. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one."
4,Buena edición.,"Este compilado de las canciones de los Beatles es realmente bueno, es fácil de ejecutar, y los acordes son casi exactos, sin embargo, no están todas las canciones y no presentan las partituras ni tablaturas para usuarios más avanzados. Pero lo recomiendo para uso personal o un regalo muy bienvenido.SaludosAlain"
3,So-so format,"Do not buy this book unless you just want to read the lyrics. This has all the songs, mostly in order, and mostly more or less what you hear on the records, so that's good. However, the book itself is too small, does not open flat or want to stay on a music stand. No problem if you don't mind breaking the binding. It needs a spiral binder to really make it useful. Not a bad book, just not as good as it could have been. Are the publishers paying attention to this?"
3,The book will not stay open due to heavy binding.,"This book contains complete lyrics and chords to all of the Beatles original compositions, it is very accurate.Unfortunately due to the number of pages and style of binding the book will not stay open. This great book is rendered USELESS by the bulky binding.I suggest, instead buying the ""Beatles Fake Book"" by Hal-Leonard publishing ISBN: 0881887579. The Fake Book also contains the songs by other artists that the Beatles covered and it uses a comb binding that allows the book to stay open."
5,The Beatles Complete Chord Songbook,"I cannot believe I waited so long to buy this book. I knew several Beatles songs before I got this book but, I have been able to learn and play nearly every Beatles song. Most of my friends are musicians also and when we get together to jam the first thing we do is play through a few Beatles songs. This book has been so much help to me. I love it. BEATLEMANIA FOREVER!"
5,The best book at any skill level (especialy level 7),"I love sharing this book with anyone having interest in both the Beatles and learning guitar. If someone is over playing music and takes an interest in this book, I always tell them to take it home and just buy myself a new one. And that's why I'm here today actually!! :)This is a great book for strumming and singing guitar, as well as learning the Beatles catalog at any skill level.""There are 7 levels""...-Paul McCartney"
5,best songbook you can get,"i think that this is for sure the best beatles songbook out there.it has all 194 songs the band wrote.just remember this is ONLY for acoustic guitar.if you want to dig deeper into their music and play the solos or the intros of the songs this one is not for you.it is suitable for strumming as it has only the chords and not the whole tab.anyway,i really think you can't get anything better than this,especially in this price."
4,Great book made better,"Enjoyable and great for sing-a-longs and easy guitar play, but not easy to keep open due to stiff binding. Took it to an office store and had them cut off the binding and add plastic binding combs and clear plastic covers. Now it opens flat, ready for singing and playing. Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
5,Best Beatle Chord Book,"I've owned a bunch of Beatle chord books through the years. Most don't account for the capos and tunings the Beatles actually used, but this book does. It also includes a ton of the more obscure Beatle songs that most chord books leave out like Blue Jay Way and Long, Long, Long. Only complaint is that it doesn't include any covers the Beatles made, a small drawback in an otherwise excellent product."
5,Love it,This book makes all the Beatle's songs playable. Awesome... I am having so much fun playing the music of my favorite all time band....
4,good book,good book good songs i would like to get more song book just like this one and get a good sell on it
3,Rick Brand,"There are two major problems. First, it should have a spiral cover so that it can actually be used by someone playing their guitar with both hands. It doesn't stay open, making it somewhere between useless and a royal pain.Second, they don't give the chords in the original key, so you cannot play along with the album if you wish. Example: And Your Bird Can Sing is written in D instead of E, as on the CD.On the other hand, it contains all the lyrics and chords to all their music, so, all things considered, I'm happy I got it."
2,Kindle Edition a real disappointment,"The formatting isn't properly done, so there are pages with only the chord diagrams. Also, the text size jumps around, and the line breaks don't match the hard cover edition. They missed a huge opportunity to do this right, in keeping with the tradition of Hal Leonard chord books doing only the minimum necessary. A real disappointment."
4,A ton of fun,"First the crits: not every song is in the original key, as advertised, and not every chord progression is strictly accurate. A good ear will solve that problem. Sometimes the author delineates measures, sometimes he doesn't, which is a little confusing; I'd suggest using measures throughout just to make it easier to read. Having said that, this book really is a ton of fun. I've picked it up virtually every day since I got it to learn something new....I mean, old. I enjoy learning the correct progressions that I've been playing wrong for decades LOL! There are books that have tab and notation for note by note transcriptions of each song, but they cost considerably more. But this is a terrific volume to just pick up and learn more great songs. I'm having a blast with it!"
5,Great Book,This is a wonderful collection for any person who loves the Beatles. The book is esy to use for anyone wanting to enjoy the best music of the last 40 years up to the present.
4,Correct keys but book is clumsy,"The songs from what I can tell are in the correct keys and all the chords are there. Note this is a book of guitar chords (with lyrics). There are no tabs, etc. So if you want to get the basic song structure down this is a great song book. The drawback is the book itself. It does not lie flat and it quickly become annoying as you try to keep the pages open. BnB Beatles Depot"
4,Beatles Complete chord book,great content...thought it was spiral bound but it's comb bound...not as sturdy...shouldn't say spiral when it's not. I would recommend changing the binding to a true spiral.
4,Happy Customer,"The book is easy to read, and shows the chords on all the songs. I am very happy with the contents.The only thing I would have wanted were bigger pages since the book needs a clip or somthing sitting on it to keep the pages open. if you try to bend it too much, you will break the bindings, so just be careful."
5,Pretty darn close...,This is absolutely the closest I've ever seen any music book come as far as its accuracy. Chords I've never been able to figure out on my own are easily provided in this song book and appear to be totally accurate. My only complaint is the binding...too hard to keep the book open. I had mine cut and made into a spiral which works beautifully. Definitely worth the money!
5,Perfect Book for Any Guitar Playing Beatles Fan,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this songbook. But let me just say it was/is beyond my expectation. It has every song you can imagine. It shows exactly how each chord is supposed to be played ([...] wise)....Lennon and McCartney did not believe in typical chords, they obviously liked to add something almost each time. It's been a blast to play songs that I never could've picked up otherwise because of some of the special chording. I highly recommend this!"
5,Incredible Book - Buy It!,"Ive played guitar for many years. Ive seen alot of incorrect Beatles tab. I even have the Beatles Complete Scores book which also is incredible. But this book is the best if you want to sit down and simply play and sing any Beatles song. Its a nice size and uses the correct keys and chords. Nothing is lowered or raised like U see in most tab books. This is the real deal and a must for anyone looking to play guitar to the worlds greatest songwriters and bands of all time. Keep the music alive people! I wish they had a book like this for solo Lennon and McCartney material. If anybody knows of one, please email me and let me know about it."
5,beatles complete chord songbook,"Excellent resource for any gigging professional musician. I found it hard to find songbooks of the beatles works, and this book has been a great find. Thanks!"
5,I love this book!!!,This book is a treasure. I've learned so much about the Beatles as composers and players. The chords and organization make this book a players delight.
5,I heard myself playing real Beatles!!!,"I'm not a professional, and I can't read music. I'm not a great guitarist, either-although I'm a big Beatles fan. But this was the first time I could finally find the right chords for ""Help!"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Come Together"" and many other so-loved hits. I could never imagine that I'd hear my own hands playing ""Because"" or even ""Helter Skelter"".. It's simple and accurate at the same time. And - the most important of all - it's an easy music book for amateurs, but it's exactly what the title says: the complete Beatles songbook...Thanks a lot!P.S. Sorry for my poor English, but I'm just a Greek lady..."
4,Beatles Song Book,"I bought this for my son and he loves it. He had wanted a book of Beatles songs he could play on his own with his guitar. This book is great for him, give him, cords, notes and words."
2,Are These The Real Chords?,"I've been working with this book. The chords don't always sound right.Also, the chord tabs often seem to choose a difficult fingering for a chord that has a much easier fingering.I find that when I can get chords on the Internet, they often sound better and are easier to play. Are these chords coming direct from the Fab Four, or did someone make these up from listening?"
3,A closed big Star,Alex Chilton is great! So the record of today is BIG STAR-COLUMBIA Live at Missouri University and on it there is a cover of SLUT by Todd Rundgren.
2,"Well, This Is What It Would Sound Like","I love Big Star, but can't stomach this album. Why someone would want to listen to this and not the originals escapes me. I guess the sound is edgier, more driving, but ultimately you listen to Big Star for the awesome songs. Yet, the voices here are so distracting (the Posies are too mellodramatic, and Chilton can't save the set) it pretty much wrecks it. Too bad, but I guess they had to prove it could be done."
2,Band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags...,"I was pretty disappointed with this CD. The band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags. However, that could be blamed on lack of preparation because this was a reunion concert. They seem to be striving for a Badfinger/Wings sound but fall far short of their lofty goals. The two most memorable songs here are both covers...Marc Bolan's ""Baby Strange"" and Todd Rundgren's ""Slut"". That's a pretty good indicator of how weak their own material is.I have yet to get the whole Big Star mystique. I saw them last year at Little Steven's Garage Fest and they were one of the very few low points. My son felt exactly the same way."
4,Best live show available,"While far from perfect this particular disc is the best live show available of the reconstituted Big Star. The live set on Big Star Story box set from the 70's is a better show, but for the modern Big Star the Columbia show is a good choice."
5,Great looking HD DVD,Great looking HD DVD. Combo format is perfect if you have kids who also want to watch on a SD DVD player. More Combos please!
4,cute,"My 5 year old daughter is an ant bulley too, this had a few laughs in it, entertaining for all ages."
4,Close to a 5 stars....fun,"Took me a while before viewing this one....and that was to my disavantagebecause this one.....is a very good movie.Yep...good for kids and adults, the animation, the characters and everthingelse works together and what comes out is a great fun movie.Just wait till you see the frog part.....excellent...I enjoyed it soo much, that i watched it again on the next day...Give it a try"
4,"believable characters, potty humour, and a message","Some might complain that the lead wasn't likeable because he started out as a bitter kid who picked on ants, but I thought the pecking order shown in the beginning where Lucas did unto ants (and less obviously, his mum) as the bully did unto him was true to human, especially kid, nature. Maybe I'm a bad person but I recall that when the most popular kids teased me when I was younger, I'd take it out on kids who had even fewer friends than me. Teaming up with those kids and standing up to my original bullies might've been more productive, but my excuse is that this movie didn't exist to teach me that. Speaking of the message, I thought the lowbrow humour offset some of the preach factor that the message could've brought about. With jokes like that I didn't feel like it was written by a teacher, or at least not by a stuffy teacher but by the fun teacher who made gross jokes to win me over, then once he earned my attention, taught me something."
5,Good pick,Good family movie for all ages. Bullying is such a great topic these days and it doesn't hurt to start early teaching this principle.
4,Cute kid's flick,"If you've seen 'A Bug's Life' or 'Antz', then this movie might be a bit predictable, but I liked this movie nonetheless. A boy is bullied at school, so he finds an outlet for his anger by picking on ants (flooding the ant-hill, using magnifying glass, etc) but the ants have had enough of it so they use magic to shrink him. He then learns a few things along the way, including the fact that just because one is bullied does not mean that it is right for them to bully others even smaller than them. Good lesson for kids."
1,This is the second bug movie I've found myself hating,"I'm sorry but the few funy scenes aren't woth he grossness and the stupidity of thsi film. I don't know what about it hit me the wrong way But jst like the movie 'Antz' I feel sick at the thought of it. Maybe it's the scene where the bug pulls up the ant's head or the need to make every thing as ew as possible or maybe the ant religion. Please if you want a good, CLEAN bug movie rent or buy 'Bugs Life' and skip this gross film."
2,would've been good except for nasty jokes!,"ok what's up with this ok i forgot most of it because i couldn't think of anything past the NINJA TURTLES MOVIE!!! oh yeah the way leonardo was swinging his swords,showing off his ninja skills oh right!!! but anyway this was ok until he was trying to find clothes to wear Y-U-C-K the queen was talking to him then she peeked over the blind and said some nasty things about him and when they were putting him on trial.yuck."
4,Entertaining,"Good family cartoon. Video showed nice detail, audio was decent, and story was humorous.The extras were good but cartoon shorts would have put over top if they were in HD."
4,Animation on a special level,It is a good enjoyable film with some deeper meaning. Not only for kids and the animation is excellent and timeless
4,Good Buy,"I bought this dvd for my grandson as a gift. He was so excited to watch it. When we opened it to watch, it skipped terribly!OK, after viewing the scratched introductions of the dvd purchased, the actual movie part of the dvd played good without the skips.Soooooo, I am changing my feedback for this product. Thank you."
2,No subtitles,"As an amazon prime member, I am disappointed this videoAND all amazon instant videos do not offer subtitles for those who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. I was disappointed again I could not watch this video with my children. They seemed to enjoy the movie, however."
1,Wrong Mouse,I ordered the copperhead and received the diamondback. A good mouse but not the one i wanted. I didnt return it cause i needed a good mouse in a hurry and i figured it could take another two weeks to get the copperhead.
3,fine mouse but...,"This is a fine, sensitive, good looking gaming mouse. The only cons are the side buttons. There are four side buttons but you can only reach two of them with any comfort while using the mouse. The non-slip coating on the mouse buttons rubs off after extended use making it look ugly. Save up and get a Naga instead!"
1,Copperhead Sucks!,"I completely agree. This mouse sucks! I got the Copperhead from my brother and was excited to try it out after hearing the reviews as a Top Gaming Mouse in comparison to the Logitech G5 - plus it's backed with the Razer reputation. I was surprised to find it flimsily constructed (the edges of the plastic isn't completely in-line at its base. I can feel the uneven edge of the plastic at the butt - think scraping) and it's super lightweight! The contour of the curve isn't comfortable and it's slim so even the smallest hands can't ""rest"" on it. The wheel is awkward and it doesn't glide smoothly (for smaller hands, you have to reach for the wheel). I honestly can't imagine how they could sell this as a premium product. Aside from the software, it feels more like a stock mouse you get with your computer but with lights.[...]"
3,"Awesome abilities, terrible ergonomics","Sensitivity, control, and programability are top of the line bar none but the placement of the buttons as well as the weird pieces of rubber along the sides are totally at odds with my hand as well as the hands of everyone I've talked to."
3,"average mouse, get the logitech g5 instead!","So I just built my new gaming rig adn got it with this mouse, it's definetly a nice mouse, good feel, good speed, but my brother came home from college with his logitech g5, so i tried it out. I am now the official owner of a logitech g5 and it was a better mouse. The G5 has interchangable weights so you can have the weight you wish for gaming or what not, The g5 is also a bigger mouse so you get a better feel and a better grip on the mouse. So if you can grab yourself the G5 rather than any razer."
4,Razaer Copperhead,"The Razer design and construction is quite nice, and the options for controlling DPI, sensitivity, etc via the bundled softare are excellent. Overall its a great product. I gave it four stars because its not quite as comfortable as the mouse it replaced (MS w'less Laser 6000). However, this a gaming mouse that is still pretty comfortable, looks great and works a treat. I am more than happy with the purchase."
1,$90 Wasted on both Mouse and Deluxe Mouse Pad,"I was so excited when the mouse arrived in the mail. The packaging looks great and it was very easy to install.The problem is if I move the mouse at a very slow speed, the mouse doesnt move because it's too slow for the sensor to know the mouse is moving. It's very annoying when you need to move at a slow and careful speed and it's not moving. I've tried putting the mouse on different material thinking maybe the Razer Mouse pad was the problem but the same thing happens.This mouse would be great if you're always moving the mouse fast but if need careful precision speed, it's very annoying. My plan is to ebay the mouse and try another one.The 4 buttons to the sides are a little stiff but since i dont use them that often, it doesnt bother me. The front 2 buttons are about right in stiffness but I wish it was slightly more soft on the clicking."
5,Flimsy? what are these people talking about!,"Must be the competition worried about this mouse taking all their buisness!Whoever said this is flimsy, must have been mistaken. This mouse is very solid, it is incredibly sensitive, and comfortable! I am upgrading this from a diamond back, which is a much smaller thinner mouse, this is much more comfortable, with an arch for my hand to rest on. I am totally in love with this mouse, it makes me sooooooo happy.Its beautiful, very sensitive, has lots of configurable buttons, and its got the backing of Razer, which is just a fantastic company to begin with.If you have the cash to drop on it I highly recomend it."
4,It grows on you...,"At first when I bought this mouse I didn't like it. It just didn't fit my hand the way I was used to holding a mouse.... but after a week or so I really started getting used to it, and now I do find it comfortable. All I can say is give it a chance and get used to it... it grows on you!Response is great and the on the fly synapse adjustment is nice... handy when you want to change sensativities without going into a setup mode.Some said you can't use the side buttons... I find that only 50% true. You can use the side buttons on your side, but the far side are not really useful in my opinion.What you do get is a quality mouse which should last some time...I find the side rails on this mouse slightly annoying. Thinking I might cut them off with a matte knife and then apply a hot knife to the cuts to soften the edges off.... but not right now, can't justify that in case I mess it up... so sometime in future I will do it."
2,NOT for small handed gamers,"This mouse has all the bells and whistles - it can do virtually anything. But it has one major problem. It is too big for anyone with a smaller hand.From my wrist to the tip of my middle finger, my hand is 6.5 inches long. This mouse is 5 inches long. To comfortably hold it, i cannot reach the mouse wheel. The two buttons on the right side are completely inaccessable to me, rendering them useless. To reach them, i have to hold my hand in a painful claw position because my pinky does not rest that far out naturally.This mouse is probably fantastic for a normal man's hand, but i have a smaller woman's hand, and purchasing this was a waste of my money.If you are a woman or a man with a smaller hand, you must take this into consideration when ordering this mouse."
1,Review of light filter,It is a too dark blue filter and as such it cannot be used in a regular photography. It is necessary to have a choice of filters with different rate of density.
3,"As a Max Brand fan, this is only fair for the author.",This book is OK but lacks the originality and creativity that usually stamps Max Brand books as truly unique.
2,Dim bulb,Got this bulb. It didnt line up properly at all. It was dim. And now i have to replace it again!
4,it helps if you've seen them live,"OK, the sound quality on this isn't the best, but it ain't half bad either. Not quite as good as Smell of Female. The psychotic CRAMPS energy is definitely there, manifested by massive chunks of guitar spew and big drum beats and Lux's maniacally musical vocals. Having seen them live I can picture what was happening on stage when this was recorded, and it must have been a blast of a show. Definitely recommended for Cramps fans."
4,"The Cramps-'Rockin'&Reelin' In Auckland,NZ'(Vengeance)","SMOKING!!I've been wanting to get a copy of 'Rockin'...' for a few months now.Was recorded at the Galaxy in Aukland,New Zealand on Aug.30,1986.Notice the recording has some fuzz and slight distortion intact,but maybe the producer of the disc meant for it to be that way.Really doesn't deter from the quality of the CD,at least I didn't think so.A lot of this live set draws from the band's 'Date With Elvis' album.Lux,Ivy&crew rip through a set of classic rambunctious psychobilly as ONLY they can.So many upbeat tracks to mention here,like ""Hot Pearl Snatch"",""Sunglasses After Dark"",an Elvis cover of ""Heartbreak Hotel"",""Do The Clam"" and ""Can Your Pussy Do The Dog"".The three bonus cuts tagged on are okay.Better than their 'Smell Of Female' CD(see my review of that disc).A must-have for any true Cramps fan."
2,Not that lively a live album :(,"When I started buying the remastered recordings made by the Cramps, my collection had included this live album. I thought it was good at first because it introduced me to some of the songs from ""A Date with Elvis"" and ""Songs the Lord Taught Us,"" but after a while I realized as a live album it lacked something. Maybe it was low on excitement or it was just plain cheesy.If you are a Cramps fan currently looking for a live album, buy ""Smell of Female,"" because that recording is so much better than this one. ""Smell of Female"" not only has a lot of original songs, but it is fueled by the adrenaline ""Rockin"" lacks."
4,From a different perspective...,"I found this book to be interesting even though I disagree with every worldview expressed in the book. I checked it out because I was curious to see more about how some famous celebrities see themselves, their purpose, and their place in this world. Its very reflective of our post-modernist culture, and the quotes from the book are a very diverse cross-section of atheistic, humanistic, and universalist views."
4,A WORTHY EDITION TO ANY FREETHOUGHT LIBRARY,"This paperback book is sort of a condensed version of Warren Smith's huge tome, Who's Who in Hell. with a focus on celebrities such as Woody Allen, Katherine Hepburn, Andy Rooney, George Clooney and many, many others. The style is quite witty and there is lots of dish on the ""damned"" famous people. You can open to any page and have a good time, especially if you are a freethinker! Religious fundamentalists will probably want to avoid this book, unless they want to learn about famous people who they believe are destined for the infernal regions.Like they say, heaven for the climate, hell for the company!"
5,wine country gal,"This is such a great story. I have always loved it, and when I saw it on the book list on line, bought it for my grandchildren and my great grandchildren. I know they will come to love this story too."
5,A Classic,I love this book and so does my son. It's beautifully illustrated and great for the times when your kids ask you if there's really a Santa Claus. I get tears in my eyes and choked up every time I read it.
5,new Bible,"This book is a mind opening and enriching truth, better then a Bible.Anybody can achive a miracle after reding that book.Thank you."
4,An interesting way to look at your life,The power of awareness gives one a totally different and new way of looking at your life and equips you with the tools to make your dreams become a reality. You have to read it slowly to really understand but it is worth every minute spent.
4,Power Without The Fluff,"This is a very straight-forward book. Some of the concepts he explains I had to read through a few times, even though I was familiar with the spiriutal concept.I have read quite a few other books that expressed the Law of Attraction in a more readable, useful format. But the Case History section where people used his methods to manifest was the most impressive."
4,"simple, subtle, powerful",This classic was written in the 1950s and still powerful and timely. Should be on everyone's bedstand.
4,Libro sabio,"Verdades profundas, nos recuerdan que el origen de cualquier cambio en nuestras vidas debe iniciar desde dentro de nosotros, de un cambio en la manera que nos percibimos"
5,The Power of Awareness,"I discovered Neville in 1996. He changed my life beyond anything I had ever imagined; beyond Unity, beyond Science of Mind... Since then I continue to read and re-read his 10 books and always find something new... No other books have influenced my life so profoundly. I am eternally grateful to this most remarkable teacher. Maria Krautner"
4,Journey of Life,"An excellent study on the way spiritward. A provocative title tht encourages one to ponder the mental composition of ourselves and how to control that mental self. The title equates the mental self with the divine, though the reviewer considers that part of our human self, rather than the spiritual trueness of ourselves. The Power of Awareness helps one to be aware of their reality and how to be in line with that reality so it can be manifested in daily life."
5,Conscious creation from an Earthly source,"Neville seems to know only what the great channelers and the most very enlightened tell us that imagination createsour world. In his audio lectures found on the web Neville speaks of his awakening. This material is similar tothe Abraham books in that the secret is to concentrate on the feeling you wish from having attained yourwish and not the wish itself or the lack of what you wish for. Neville, like many others, encourages us to usethis power to become who we want to be and not to get lost in the wishing for material objects forego gratification. The writing is clear and deliberate as is his speaking. A good companion to this bookwould be Neville's ""Awakened Imagination"" which gives a little more on this technique."
3,The Power of Awareness,Nothing much new for me. I have been a student of Eastern philosophy for many years and hoped this would be informative.
5,Powerful!,"Truly wanting to understand the role of imagination in my goal setting, I finally got it reading this book. Neville Goddard clearly explains the roles of feelings, attention, concentration, and seeing life from the place of 'your wish fulfilled'. If you ever wanted to validate your reasons for pretending (pre-intending), then you will love the child-like nature within reach of every dream and desire that the author shows is the true place of power."
5,Great teachings for those looking through the vale...,"I have been a fan of Neville's work since hearing of him from Dr. Wayne Dyer. The book provides yet more teachings for looking through the vale we develop in our earthly life and pushes for further understand of the true, never ending self. However this book is deep and thought-provoking, and takes study and application to really get what he is saying. It is tailored for the serious earthy soul looking to the understanding of the true self. So don't purchase this unless you are seriously committed to developing your true self. Any less committed to the task, you are likely to get bored. However if you are truly committed to the adventure of self-discovery and stick with the teachings, you will get a lot out of this book. Cheers!"
1,Repackaged Vedanta Philosophy - Nothing new.,There are no new ideas in the book. These thoughts have been declared by great Indian philosophers of India thousands of years ago. This book is just a re-package of some of the proclamations of the great Upanishads. For deeper understanding I recommend readers to read good translation of the Upanishads - a certain way for enlightenment.
4,Powerful Information for Positive Thinkers!,"This book is a must read for anyone who believes in the power of positive thinking and creating positive awareness. I found the book easy to digest and easy to incorporate into my daily life. This is a must have for those wanting to positively influence their own lives and lives of others and want to improve their outlook for today, tomorrow, and forever. A worthy read!"
2,Broke quickly,"This was a gift for my mom. She liked the look of it a lot and put it in her flower garden. We're not sure how, but the rain gauge part broke quickly. There wasn't any info on how to replace it."
5,"Very good viewfinder, but fairly distorted","It's well made and the view is clear and big and eminently usable. It is a lot more distorted than I'd want my actual lens, but that doesn't keep you from using it effectively. And it's a lot cheaper than the Leica viewfinders."
3,Phone functionality is just a side effect,"I have had the 8525 for about 2 months. I also suffer from having to frequently reboot. Dialing numbers is difficult as the on-screen number keys are not very responsive. Voice recognition repeats the name over the speakerphone before dialing which is irritating. Dialing contacts (one handed, without a stylus) is much easier if you download software to map the ptt button to your contact list, then add your most frequent contacts to the top of the list. Data connection with bluetooth is so-so. Data connection with USB is great...had no problems. I like the device itself, but I give 3 stars due to Window$ Mobile software."
2,It freezes alot. That's it!,"I'm realy satisfy of the overall features. but, It freezes 5,6 time a day after turning on the device. I cooudn't even turn it off! I have to take the battery out and then try it over. I don't know, maybe I have to update the firmware. I'm trying to figure it out."
2,beware when purchasing this phone.,"Talked to at&t; about this phone. Was told that b/c i am a customer from the old at&t; network, i cannot purchase UNless i give up my number. So there is no number portability with old at&t; customers.Additionally, the notion of incurring a 250$ fee for practically anything makes it an unwise purchase imho. Cannot upgrade or downgrade, or pay a day late......Spend the money on the phone now, or, spend it later when incurring the fee penalty fee."
2,I left ATT because of this phone DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"This is the worst PDA phone I have ever owned. I had a Treo 650 and the Blackjack before purchasing this phone.I have replaced this phone twice through warranty and now as my replacement phone has the same issues as my original, I am selling it on craigslist and moving on to another carrier.What doesn't work on my phone:1. The talk button brings me to the phone screen then the phone goes immediately back to the start screen.2. Going to the text message screen then clicking on the center button to read a message brings up the options menu and will not allow me to read messages.3. Doing a hard reset of the phone gets me stuck on the screen alignment step.4. really the list goes on an on.I spoke with a customer rep at a store location and was told that this phone has been brought in and returned by multiple customers over the past week.DON'T BUY THIS PHONE! I cant say it any more clear. If you do purchase the 8525 it will eventually break."
4,Confirmed - cancelling data plan invalidates $250 rebate,"Thought I'd post this info here, since this subject still confuses people. I just talked to a cust care representative, who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180-day period will invalidate $250 Amazon phone rebate.Well, I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer, since I don't really need a data plan, and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time. Any comments?I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product. I'll take one star off however, due for its weak battery life, and lack of standard audio connection (2.5"" or 3.5"" minijack)."
1,Clunky and didn't work after a few days,"I thought I would love this phone and wanted to download my nursing software on it. First the pluses. The calendar mode was fabulous. I loved the stylus and those features. The Negs...I never got around to adding any software. The screen is way to small to realistically view any webpages although it loaded pretty easily with the 3G network. I quickly found that the green phone function button would not work after the phone had been locked and then unlocked...so to get to your phone book or to be able to dial a number you had to go through the menu and a long drawn out process. The phone was short so uncomfortable to talk on and clunky. Somehow the phone also would get stuck on my call history page and wouldn't go back to the contacts. I don't know if I got a lemon, but I sent it back and just got a reg. sync...and will use my old dell pda."
1,don't buy it,"Can't hear anything on incoming calls without headphones or an ear piece. By the time I turn on speakerphone, they hang up. Camera does not take good photos of anything that is not close up. I bought it for the high speed network but don't notice any difference from dial up when using it as a modem for my p.c.. Should have bought a regular cell phone and a lap top."
2,Reboot City............,"This is without doubt, the worst PDA/phone I have ever used. The problem that the other reviewers stated that the phone reboots, is 100% true. It locks up, does not allow transfer of data to the memory card and does not work with the software included.Amazon is supposed to replace this poor excuse for technology with a Palm Treo, but dealing with Amazon is turning into an obtuse situation. Now I understand why the prices on Amazon are so low. The products are defective and/or second rate.DO NOT GET THE 8525, UNLESS YOU WANT A HEADACHE IN MORE WAYS THEN ONE!"
2,Do research for a better product,Bought this watch and the illumination featured never worked; when you push on the button it goes blank. The compass has to be reset frequently and the altimeter always gives erroneous readings.
1,Piece of junk,This watch has gone blank on me several times. Removing the battery and putting it back makes it reset to 1/1/2006 and loses altitude.For 3 months the altimeter was inaccurate but marginally useful. Now it randomly changes the altitude. I bought a new battery and went for hike. I set the altitude to 2200 feet and 2 minutes later it said 2800 feet. The compass never worked at all.
3,"It's Not The Greatest Album Of All-Time, People!","See, this is why Amazon reviews are absolutely worthless. 20 reviews, and 18 of them give this album 5 stars, while 2 reviews give it 4 stars. Seriously people? This is an absolutely flawless masterpiece? This is one of the very greatest albums you've EVER heard? Here's the actual truth: it's a decent album. It has a few standout tracks, namely In Shakespeare's Garden, Crash, She Said and It's Over Now, but much of the rest is filler or forgettable. Overall, it has its moments, but to give THIS album 5 stars, you must either work for the band or just not own a whole lot of music! Comparably, what would Black Celebration or Music For The Masses get? 5's, I would assume? So, this is equal to Depeche Mode's greatest albums, even as this is clearly indebted to DM? So, basically every album you like gets a '5'? That's not how ratings are supposed to work, guys. This is a '3' all the way."
5,great price for replacemnent heads,This was a replacement for our original that delaminated at the head - better price than other stores as well.
5,Powerful,"It's rare when a film can be as powerful as a great book but this one did it. At the same time it dazzeled one with its vagery, abstractness, mystical humanism and outright terror at the condition mankind has arrived at in the end of a century and a millenium. The ending in the fog was numbing, Keitel's final dialogue chilling. This was strictly a European film, its existentialism beyond the grasp of American audiences."
2,And no stars for the DVD...dissapointing,"I had high hopes for this film, but it ultimately comes off as a pale imitation of a Tarkovsky film, an attempt to copy in form while paying little attention to content. It just seems that Angelopoulos had a few very thin ideas and he spread them over three hours so that they would appear to have some weight. While there are a few excellent images in this film, they are few and far between, and there is little to hold your interest otherwise. The acting is also, at times, very stilted and clunky. If you would like to a see a film that is similar in pacing and theme then see Tarkovsky's ""Nostalghia"", ""The Sacrifice"" (both of which also feature Erland Josephson), or ""Stalker"".About the DVD: Even if you enjoyed this, or think you might, this is possibly the single worst transfer to DVD that I have seen. The image is grainy, colors are bland, and digital blocks and color lines pop up periodically. Very, very sloppy. Steer clear of this DVD!"
3,No Idea but,"Had such difficulty hanging on to the journey. Could not but grasp the numbing sadness and hopelessness of a people. So many ""nowhere"" with no hope."
2,Beautiful but ultimately confusing and disappointing,"This movie is about a personal journey by one man looking partly for lost reels of film, and partly for his own past. The music and much of the cinematography in this film is quite beautiful; some of the images, such as the statue of Lenin floating down the river are absolutely unforgettable. The problem is that the director's artistic vision seems to be getting in the way of storytelling, and the result is a film with a lot of atmosphere and little substance.Anyone who claims to really understand this film is probably afflicted by the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" syndrome: too embarrassed to admit that this artful film just doesn't make any sense. Harvey Keitel and Maia Morgenstern seem to float in and out of various characters without any explanation. Had the editing been a lot better, perhaps the filmmaker's message would've come through. As is, it's mostly just confusing and ultimately disappointing."
2,Roger Ebert is mostly right,"The philosophy and intelligence that went into making this film is very admirable, but hey it doesn't make it a good film. Remember, it's the execution of the film that matters. And I think this film is executed in a very awkward fashion. Angelopoulos is clearly going for something transcendental here, with his sometimes-magical imagery (like the Lenin statue and the blue ship). But there are so many awkwardly staged scenes and Keitel's performance is so out-of-place that the film just doesn't work for me. If you want to see a really tremendous Eastern European film, go rent ""Before the Rain"", not this."
2,Highly pretentious,"There are points in this film where I was totally convinced that Angelopoulos was astonished at his own profundity. The scene with the Lenin statue turning slowly in the boat goes on and on and on. And nothing happens. It is a shot of Lenin's head and hand. It occured to me that is was supposed to be profound, but it wasn't. This film is so slow, so heavy-handed, and so unforgivably arty that it's almost humorous. There was clearly a big problem with the translation of dialogue, and the characters speak in poetics. They are not real people. No one here is. This is like the longest, most arty home film ever made. Angelopoulos puts the viewer in his living room and runs his most personal movie for the viewer for THREE hours, and gives us nothing in return. Nothing to think about, barely anything to feel. And to think he was upset at not winning the Golden Palm. This is almost as appalling as his next film, Eternity and a Day."
2,pretentious blaha,"One of the most pretentious attempts to overdo things, this one is utterly boring. It is too long. One hour of it is totally useless. And a display of artistic ego and navel gazing. Nothing else. Unfortunately, it also became one of those movies that rightly did not pass thru the meticulous Cannes Festival, and the prize went fairly to Kusturica's ""Underground"".It is supposed to be about Bosnia and the conflict in Balkans, but what we see an aimlessly wandering Keitel - who apparently does not know why he is in that movie - and lots of meaningless shots and empty monologues.That said, let us get the record straight. Theo Anghelopoulos is one of the greatest film makers and humanists ever, and this is frankly his worst movie. Because he is uneven. He created a masterpiece: ""Eternity and a Day"", which is a must for movie lovers.His ""Theatre Company"" (1975) and ""Landscape in a Mist"" (1985) are other jewels. Demand and wait for them instead."
1,Aweful! Does not smell like Vertiver at all!,"I definitely do not recommend this product. Furthermore, it is a very tiny bottle and for the price it is definitely not worth it at all. I have used vetiver perfume extensively and this scent does not even come close to the real vetiver. Instead, it smells aweful...the scent even made me sick to my stomach!"
5,Awesome Aussie S Club Single,"This single has four songs on it (all of them great!) The track listing includes:1) Natural (Single Version): 5/5 This is ans awesome song and Rachel does a stellar job on it2) If It's Love : 4.8/5 Really cool and mellow song with Jon on the leads, Pretty catchy at certain parts.3) You're My Number One (Almighty Mix) : 5/5 I can never complain about an Almighty mix, they always do a great job.4) Stand By You: 6/5 This is my Second favorite S Club song ever. Hannah and Tina are perfect for the duet.The picture gallery has one picture from each member of the group, so it's pretty small.Worth the money and I got it faster than the US cd's I ordered with it."
5,Emma's Best,"""Crickets Sing For Anamaria"" is the 4th Single released of the ""Free Me"" album, the second piece of pop perfection delivered by the brilliant Emma Bunton.This Song is very different than the other tracks released from ""Free Me"". In this track, Emma explores Latin Rhythms (Brazilian Rhythms), using the Latin samba with hand-claps and fast paced lyrics that will make you wanna dance for sure.Emma puts in this song a refreshing & exquisite sound that you will enjoy too.If this is not enough for you, Emma includes in this Single (The 2 CD Set) the radio edit of the track, cover versions of Paul Anka's ""Eso Beso"" and Astrud Gilberto's ""So Nice (Summer Samba)"", the ""Crickets Sing For Anamaria"" ""Elements' Crickets Dance On Tequila Booty Mix"" & and a stunning slowed down ""Maybe"" Latin Version. Plus, you will get an Amazing sexy pic of Emma in the cover of both singles.Buy It Now, It's One of the best singles of 2004, you won't regret it.Thanks for reading this review. =)"
4,Chirp Spice,"Emma Bunton has released one of the best pop albums of 2004. ""Free Me"" is a collection of 60's esque bossanova-swing tracks that have a cool martini lounge feel to them.The songs suit her voice perfectly and thank GOD there aren't any r&b-lite; atrocities on this solo-spice album.Crickets is a fun track that is pure summer time buzz. You may forget it by Labour Day but you'll have a great time listening to it until then. Odd that she would release this as her third single and not the more radio-normal ""Breath"" or ""Who the Hell are You?"".The remixes are good so the CD would be a great purchase.Now if only Victoria ""Posh"" Beckham would take a lead from her form Spice mate and stick to what these girls do best...POP!!!"
3,When Anyone's In Love...,"This single was Emma's worst seller. It did go higher than ""We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight"" by 5 chart positions (Crickets = #15, Sleep = #20). As great as the song was, this specific CD was a dud. CD #2 was better.SONG: AWESOME! Emma rocks out the latin vibe better than fellow Spicer, Geri! And Geri's latina! I love the bouncy, dancy mood this puts a person in. I'm in love with this.B-REMIX: As much as I love ""Maybe"" and the latin theme, I do not like putting other singles' remixes on a new single. The latino mix makes a more love-esque sound to the song and turns it into a slow ballad. Not bad, but why on the crickets CD?Overall: Okay for a two track single. Buy CD#2. It's better."
5,Beautiful!,I first heard Ms. Spencer live in concert when touring with TOFOG. I was hooked immediately. Since I bought this CD I've hardly listened to anything else. The music is quite haunting and very surprising. The lyrics are personal and very touching. I hope that becomes better known in the US as she is in Australia. I can't wait for her next CD.
1,Where's the heat?,"I just bought this and had it on all night and my room is still freezing. You have to put your hand right next to it to feel any heat. If you stand a foot away you can't feel anything. Plus, it's kind of noisy. The only good thing is that it seems to be pretty sturdy and it looks nice. I also like the tower because it disperses the heat about a foot and a half off the ground, unlike some of the other models."
1,Just horrible,"This is horrible. The whole video features 6 large breasted women who dance around and strip nude - this should be good, but they mess it up by having 2 images of said woman dancing in 2 outfits stripping at different speeds and they keep fading the one image out while they fade the other one in - so you never can get a good look at these hot babes. Do not buy this one."
4,"If you like busty women, you'll be DD-lighted",Nothing but beautiful busty women. This is a shamless video exhibition of gorgeous large-chested women. You'll love it!
4,Charming and funny. And sooo 80's...,"Michelle Pfeiffer is good as the wife of a mobster who sees her chance to start a new life when her husband gets killed, but his boss (and murderer), Tony ""The Tiger"" Russo has the hots for her. At the same time, FBI thinks she was involved in the murder of her husband. Mercedes Ruehl is hilarious as Tony's wife. Joan Cusack has a small part as a mobster's wife, and Roma Maffia appears in one of the last scenes, as Angela's customer.The movie, and Michelle Pfeiffer, is quite charming but the clothes, hair styles and earrings are hilarious. I can't recall having seen any movie that feels more 80's than this one. It's not great, but charming and funny. It's hard to choose between three and four stars."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Jonathan Demme film that I had never seen before, even though it was released back in 1988. Might have been funnier at the time, but the cliches don't really hold up well through today, especially after having shows such as the Sopranos give us an idea of what a mob wife's life might really be like."
5,Peek-A- What???,"We recieved this book as a gift, and I was really skeptical that it would be any good. I'm pretty selective about what I read to my son but this is the first book that ever really held my son's attention. In fact the first time I read it to him at 9 months he was roll over hysterical with the kind of laughter we got from physically tickling him.No it doesn't have a fancy plot or any real life lessons but the simple rhymes and busy colors make my son laugh. If he finds the book on the floor he will try to flip through the pages himself, he always takes a moment to study the mirrored page at the end. This simple book is definately a favorite."
4,Author's Book Review,"A wonderful little book to add to your child or grandchild collection. Adorable illustration and what little one can resist Peek-a Who? Personally I like books that titles include a question.Sommer Hamilton author of the spooktacular children's book ""Did I Scare You?"". A must have for the adventurous children in your life. Visit Sommer at [...]"
5,All my kids first favorite book,"Because who who is an easy sound, this book was both my daughters favorite first book. The sounds are easy to make to read along. Who who, choo choo, zoo, boo...Highly recommend this book."
1,It's ok,"The book is ok. I read it to my 7 month old son, he does not enjoy it as much as other books. I would not recommend."
4,Cute book,"(written by Michael's wife, Jessica) We bought this book as a baby shower present for our niece but decided to keep it for our daughter who was already 7 months old because at the end there is a mirror. Our baby adores mirrors. She loves kissing the baby in the mirror. If your child finds this amusing, this book is a definite must."
3,Book is size of my hand,"This book is literally the size of my hand and it probably explains why its so cheap. However, my son likes looking at the bright colors and pictures."
2,Don't waste your money,"My 18 month old loves to play ""Peek-a-boo"", and if anything saying ""Peekachoo, peekamoo, peekazoo, etc."" was confusing. Will stick with the pop up books for now-they always bring a smile to his face!"
2,Too simple,"The images are nice, but the book itself is simply too simple. A picture of a ghost and the word ""Boo""? Not for us at any rate."
4,Nice,Peek-A Who is a favorite of my three your old granddaughter (we made a Dutch translation). It is the joy of understanding what is on the next page. The owl and the mirror she likes best.
4,Cute book!,This is one of my daughter's favorite books! It's nice and short and easy for them to memorize. My daughter can anticipate what the next page has because of the 'windows' on the pages. This is a great book for toddlers!
5,Absolute Favorite!,"This is my 11 month old baby girl's absolute favorite book. She loves it so much she not only spends time just paging through it on her own but she's nearly bitten the spine in half. Hands down, this more than any other book holds her attention and she actually gets upset when it ends. Sometimes I have to read it over and over until I can distract her. This is a must have book for babies."
4,very cute and re-read book!,"Our 18 month old daughter loves to bring this book to us, to read to her. She still gets excited on the last couple of pages, with the mirror. Easy, fast read, especially with a toddler anxiously turning the pages so fast! lol. The only minor down side is the cover also has a cut-out hole so, the cover is bent and very worn from her using that to open/turn the page."
5,Baby's Favorite,"I can't explain why but my baby instantly connected with this book at around 10 months. As we read it, he says ""ahh ahh oooooohh"" and turns the pages to see the images that are concealed."
4,Peek - a - Zoo,My daughter received this for her 1st birthday and now when we play peek a boo her joke is Peek a Zoo. Cracks me up every time. Within a couple of weeks she could read the entire thing to me since it's so short an easy.Very cute book.
5,perfect peek a boo book,My daughter is now 3 and a half and is excited to show her new baby sister this book because it was one of her favorites! When she was young we read it over and over and it never got old for her.
5,Read it over and over again!,My son (13 months) has loved this book for about 6 or 7 months now. We read it five times last night and each time he laughed when we got to the last page. Talk about bang for your buck!
5,Cute and fun book for a baby.,"Our son was 4 months at Christmas and loves this book in his ""rotation"".It's quick and clever with a great ending (I won't spoil it)."
3,short and not inspired,"It's okay for what it is but it is not inspired. There is a mirror at end of book which baby liked to look at. I think when he gets older, he can play at guessing what is on next page. But it is really short, only five or so peek-a-who's. And the other reviewer was right. There is no narrative thread that ties the whole book together. The book itself seems to be of good quality, thick boards, good printing."
5,Great board book for infants and their parents,"My son has loved this book since we gave it to him at about 5 months old. He's now 7 months and in the ""grab and eat everything"" phase, but still settles down and studies the pictures in Peek-a-Who when we read it to him. I've already ordered several more for baby shower gifts. And just like some other reviews state, it's nice and short."
2,just okay...,"I expected this book to be much better, especially after reading the reviews. But I'm really not impressed at all. Just not a very creative attempt at rhyming. Doesn't really make sense - the rhyming is all ""oo"" sounds but really the context seems off. And even the owl on the first flap falls flat. The ghost doesn't make sense either. It's a strange combination of being too simple (with basic rhymes) and too complex (really young kids are going to have a hard time grasping ""zoo"" ""boo"" ghosts, etc.). If you want a good rhyming and flap book, I'd go with some of the ones from DK Publishing or Baby Enstein's Mirror Me book."
1,Infantile Book,"This book is for really young babies who respond to bold graphics and colors. It's very short and very basic, containing 3-word, repetitive phrasology (Peek-a-Moo, Peek-a-Boo, Peek-a-Zoo, Peek-a choo choo, Peek-a-You - there, now you've read it.)IMO it will bore most older babies, because it lacks even basic concept development or rudimentary story progression. To my 13 month old it may as well be a drink coaster. (In fact the book is about the same size as a large coaster, maybe that's what I will use it for.)"
1,The book contains a grand total of 15 (mostly repeated) words,"This book is so brief as to not be engaging/ entertaining whatsoever...it literally contains 15 total words, 10 of which are ""peek a"" and can be read in 30 seconds. Provides insufficient enjoyment for a little rascal as not much to discuss/ describe on each page. I didnt know it was so easy to get a 4.5 star amazon review for a crappy children's book...maybe I picked the wrong line of work.p.s. I don't find it ""cute"" or ""fun"". Yes I am annoyed that someone is rich as a result of this drivel. Buy some Dr. Seuss, brown bear, or the hungry caterpillar books which are thoroughly engrossing by comparison and will occupy your child for 5+ min"
1,bad smell,"This book has a strong odor. Despite the fact that I put it on the porch for a month hoping the wind may blow away some of the smell, it still has that odor. I think it's because the pages are laminated by plastic. Anyway, I didn't give it to my baby."
1,Inappropriate Content for Age,"I ordered this book from Amazon because I trusted the reviews. However, I won't give this book to my 1-year-old granddaughter because the author included a ghost in the content. No child this age needs to be hearing about ghosts. It only opens a door for discussion of this subject at an age when the child can't possibly understand even the best explanation... not to mention all the weird explanations that might be given."
5,4 and 2 year old favorite,"My daughters (2 and 4) love this book! They even fight over it sometimes. It is cleverly designed with ""peeking windows"" and the illustrations are wonderful. Great book!"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in the length of this book, and with the lack of text. My son prefers books with some sort of a rhythm to them, and this one had so few words that sharing it with my son doesn't really even count as ""reading"" to him. To me, this is more of a picture book or an exercise in visual stimulation for the under 12-month set, than a book I expect to keep my son entertained now that he's a toddler. If you are looking for a book to that will be relevant for more than the first year of your child's life, I think there are much better choices out there."
1,Stay away from this product!,"I purchased it, but had to return it. Horrible soundtrack with frequent loud popping sounds that both startle and annoy. I own a much cheaper version and the soundtrack is vastly superior. Why they have this spread out on four discs I have no idea. Selling gimmick I presume. The Clutching Hand can easily fit on to one or two discs. Mine fits on one, and the picture and sound quality are as good or better than this seemingly pointless release (except to make money of course). The DVD case is designed to only hold two of the four DVDs securely in place, so the other two are always coming loose with the greatest of ease and moving around inside the case getting scratched up and whatnot. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Not the same book,"There are two books from the same authors, with similar titles. Thin Within, and Thin Again are not the same book, though they espouse the same principles. Thin Again has a more overtly spiritual approach. No problem for me, but I preferred the more complete Thin Within, which I had gotten from the library. It was so good, I wanted my own copy. But when ordering from Amazon, I could not tell if these two books were the same with different titles, or not. The reviews were almost identical. I ordered Thin Again, which was not the one I really wanted. Just a ""heads up"" for buyers."
1,Disappointing,"Judy Wardell wrote one of the very best, and first, non-diet books for achieving desired weight loss - ""Thin Within"". Then she got married. I can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative, insightful writer into a Bible-beating fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph."
5,Love it!,I bought this for a long car trip and I love it. Best car investment I've made in years- no more searching for CD's or finding them all over the car. Easy to use and a great sound.
1,Did not work out of the box - customer service non-existent,"I bought this item for my daughter - after fighting with it for an hour we tried calling their customer service for help (we could never get in touch with a live body to help us - just transferred from number to number in a circle). In frustration, we packed it up and sent it back and bought something from Radio Shack instead that works just fine (and was a lot cheaper)."
2,Not so good,There is so much static that we can hardly hear our music. I was disappointed with this product.
5,this is not mtv's flacid hiphop,"WARNING: this album may cause MC's hot flashes and feelings of inadequacy. the truest hiphop I've heard in far too long. Hiphop isn't about guns and gold anymore and this album shows the heart of the musicians and artists that push hiphop to new levels of expression. Anticon is what music should be, forward thinking and defiant. Especially amazing to me is the composition of dj Signify's Meditations, proving that dj's can create a new music rather than skratching 'ahhhh' endlessly over played out breaks. Just buy it and see what I'm yammering about."
1,Garbage,"Get these Clowns outta here.This is not Underground Hip Hop. Its A bUnch of Rich White kids from Maine who had No friends And now think they are superior Hip hop Cause The Can talk rediculous Big Words, and rhyme About the Sun And the Moon And Stuff. And no im Not A Commercial fan, I hate commercial, but i love underground....and this is just Nerd garbage.Take Big L for Example, completeley underground, HAd incredible complex rhyming, Witty word play and punchlines, and never once was rhymin about the sun and the moon and all this other garbage where hear from groups like anticon.Real Underground is what you want: Try Big L, DITC, Wu Tang, Immortal technique, Diabolic, O.C. etc etc."
1,Lost Anticon verse found in Bible Code,"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"
2,Elitist Snobbery,"This has no joy, no fun, no energy. ""Rainmen"" is a great track, but from there on in this CD gave me a headache and made me tired and angry. By the end I felt like the Incredible Hulk...""MIKE SMASH!"" Sure, they're creative and weird, but are they fun or interesting? NO! This is overrated B.S. If you want weird, cool hip hop, try MF Doom, Edan, or Kool Keith. This is hip hop for people who don't like hip hop. Stick to Radiohead and let the rap kids have fun, snobs."
1,Pseud's Revenge,"I look forward to more input from you masterminds. I can feel my brain expanding with every comment.P.S. If you think Joe Beats productions are cutting edge, listen to ""Do You Know Squarepusher"". It blows the Anticon collective out of the water. Most of his albums have one good song (usually the first one), followed by a lot of painful garbage. Hard Normal Daddy is the exception."
4,A workout for the real girl next door!,"I got this DVD because I love the girls, but once I went through the routines, I loved the girls even more for coming up with a great, enjoyable workout DVD! I can definitely feel the burn in Bridget's boot camp, and use Holly's at night before I go to bed. Kendra's routine isn't really my style, but it was still effective."
3,I was expecting more...,"I bought this Workout DVD thinking it would contain more excersizes & tips on how to be fit & look good because,well,playboy girls are supposed to be the most beautiful women ever,right?Well,these girls obviously have trainers or state of the art gym equipment when they lived at the Playboy Mansion.Holly's Express workout is the best one(she does a good job explaining each step and maintains a professional approach),Bridget's workout is a little scary(her smile NEVER goes away & some of her movements look like she's causing injury to herself or look just plain uncomfortable),Kendra's workout is a total joke,she doesn't take it seriously at all,she laughs the entire time & also seems to be under the influence of some sort of mind-altering substance :-/ There is also a short interview ""special feature"",it's not really ""special"",just Holly trying to sell you Playboy gym clothes."
5,Incredible!,"I love this workout video & it's worth every penny. They have a light workout (Holly), middle of the road workout (Brigette), and cardio workout (Kendra). I used to have an extra row of fat under my butt cheeks & doing Brigette's bun routine got rid of it after a few months! In order for the routines to be effective you must do them at least 4-5 times/week but they don't get old and they're not super tiring. I've had this DVD for several months now & it's still my fav. exercise video."
4,rating on work out dvd.,"It's a cute work out dvd for any girls next door fan. Easy work outs with holly, Briggettes mild & kendra hard. Fun work out. Production value a little cheesy. & you'll need a work out ball weights yoga mat & jump rope. It's a good work out :)"
1,For beginners....,"Honestly I was so excited about this workout but it was not worth it. I'm a big fan of the Firm workouts which make me sweat my butt off. These workouts were more for beginners. And honestly I think Kendra's was probably the best one. It definitely was the hardest. Overall, I probably would like the video if I was new at working out but it's not a very good workout at all. And the segments are way too short."
5,Great Workout!,"I love watching The Girls Next Door and I caught the episode of them making the workout dvd, as soon as it was over I went online and pre-ordered it. I got it today and tried it out. I'm a fit person who works out everyday so I didn't expect too much from it, but hey it's The Girls Next Door so I had to do it. The fifteen minutes with Holly was a nice toning workout to hit some of those difficult places. Then it came to Bridget and man I was sweating like you wouldn't believe by the end of that one. With Kendra, it was an awesome power workout at the end of the dvd. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good time hitting some key places that everyone wants to look great. Great job Holly, Bridget and Kendra!"
5,Pure fun...and pain!,"I love this workout DVD! It kicked my butt, my quads still hurt. I was laughing and sweating for the whole thing. It feels real, like your one of their friends and you're just working out together. I was never bored or felt like I wanted to stop the video...which I usually do! I highly recommend this for anyone that needs a good motivater and a good laugh."
5,best workout video i have (thus far),"i love this workout video! it's great at toning, you need minimal equipment, and the instructors talk to you the whole time. Sure, they're a little plastic looking, and having slightly annoying voices, but that doesn't really matter. I feel the results the next day, even when stretching. probably not the best video for the advanced exerciser, but great if you're an immediate to beginner."
2,Bridget Needs to do the Workout,"I think it's great to be able to endorse a product, but you should also be a user of the thing as well. Bridget Marquardt is obviously not doing her workout or any of the workouts on this tape on a regular basis.Stand behind your product! Use it!"
2,never received it,I never received the Girls Next Door Workout Video. I am not pleased with amazon.com. Please email me back with a response.
2,Makeup Toy,"I knew this product would not be of the highest quality. But, half of the parts that go with it do not even work. The idea of being able to attach plastic finger nails to a round platform and paint them doesn't happen; you can not even get the finger nails to stay attached. There is a blowing fan that is suppose to swirl glitter around; good idea, but does not move anything around. The case is hard to open and close. The idea of it is fun and my 6-yr old thinks it is pretty cool to play with, so I do not mind that it is junk. But I would not recommend it if you are counting on everything working."
1,I completely disagreed with this book,I found this book to be outragously wrong in most area. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Quite good....,"The leader in the field does it again! A great product, but I sometimes feel the hype is too much.I would suggest it if it was the only alternative."
5,One of my Favorite Albums,I've owned the CD since 1996. This CD never grows old. I still enjoy pulling it out and giving it listen. I think it captures the feel and diversity of Louisiana/New Orleans music. The CD always manages to make me feel good after a listen. What more can you say about a CD. I hope Sonny puts something new out soon.
1,Damaged goods....,"The CD case was shattered when I received it. Poor packing.........could have done a much, much better job of packing it."
4,Early Sonny,"Okay, let's start with the premise that there is no bad Sonny Landreth music. This guy has been honing his art since he was about 12, and he only gets better with time, so you will not be wasting your money if you buy this CD by any means. That said, however, this one isn't going down as my all-time favorite of Sonny's records. The songsmithing is interesting, but not as well-honed as it becomes by ""The Road We're On."" The guitar is clean and beautiful, but perhaps not as richly plentiful as it is on later efforts. It's really fun to hear the early studio version of ""Congo Square,"" and there are some cool tunes on here you won't find anywhere else, including the title track, but if you are just getting into Sonny Landreth, and want to be purely blown away by his genius, start with ""Grant Street,"" then work your way back to this one."
2,I liked about half of it,"I don't know why everyone (but me), is giving this album 5 stars. There's a lot of junk on the CD. Tracks 4,6,8,11 and the hidden track 12 have no energy and very little guitar.Try The Road We're On instead."
1,Published in 1916...so dated!,I was looking to inspire my son to read more...this definitely didn't do it...bad choice of stories and so dated!
1,Did not include the story I bought it for!,"I bought this because my kiddo needed to read, ""The Bass, The River, and Sheila Mant"" for school. He was out sick and didn't have his text book, so I thought I would download it to my kindle for him to stay caught up. When I searched the story title, this book is the only one that came up for the kindle, and that would lead one to believe that story is included in the book. It would be most helpful if the description contained the stories that are included, or don't have it pop up in the search for stories that are NOT in the book. I am very annoyed that I spent money on something that does not have what I need!"
1,The Art of Mexico,This is a slider show and extremely tedious. Students can now do something similar on-line. Not worth the purchase price.
3,VW Bus,"I bought this as a gift for someone, thinking that it was a die-cast model. However, when I opened the shipping box, I found that it wasn't what I was expecting. There was no mention at the time when I was shopping for it that it was a model where you had to glue the pieces as well as paint them. Needless to say I was disappointed in that.Otherwise, shipping went very nicely, and they were easy to do business with."
1,Would not re-order; do no recommend this product/vendor,We've been ordering 10 boxes at a time of this specific item from another vendor. These were almost half the price of what we normally pay. Now I know why: the gloves were useless. They tore in the process of putting them on. The gloves must have been really old.
2,Same old information ..,"Although the book arrived in good condition and packaged well, I started to read it. The information (I should have suspected it) was the same information in most diet books. Some of it was funny? or silly, so I quit after about 30 pages and gave it away. I am NOT saying the book was not good for some people who like light reading, just not for me.."
5,Losing weight and loving it.,"I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weight Loss. I believe that your book makes so much sense! I have already lost 10 pounds in a month's time by adopting many of the principles found in the book--eating 0-5, avoiding artifical sweetners and fake fat, and incorporatingmore protien and less carbs into meals. I enjoy a small amount of dark chocolate every day or so...and I do not feel deprived at all! I am also exercising more, mostly cardio and yoga. Like many others, this has been a longtime struggle for me. I have tried Weight Watchers several times and found that I was more obsessed with food than when not on the program. In any case, I could go on and on like so many of your readers probably do. I just wanted to thank you and let you know that I loved your book, completely agree with your sensible approach, and will recommend it highly to others. Thanks!"
3,It does the job well,"I bought the Tiffen 52mm Neutral Density 0.6 Filter just before I went to our trips to Canada--- we visited Banff, Jasper, and other beautiful areas. I have to say that the images with ND filter on look much better than without, especially blue water and skies. I shoot Av (Canon 7d) aperture priority all the time, and I did not want to spend time on setting the right exposure. With ND filter on, the sky looks good and overall I am satisfied. It was not good enough to allow me to capture streams in daylight at 1.0 sec or longer shutter speed, as the picture looked blown out still... Anyway, it's good for the price."
5,Great filter for waterfalls,"This product works great for taking pictures of waterfalls (with a tripod) or for any time you need to use a slower shutter speed. I haven't had any problems with it, used it twice."
5,Nice Filter,"Not a whole lot to review, product is pretty simple. It arrived on time, is well built and works as advertised. Better results can be achieved in hard light situations. Allows for slower shutter speeds in bright conditions. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Fun To Use,"I bought this ND lens to try to capture the flowing techniques of water and wind. I had to play a little with the shutter speed to get the photos just right, but I had a lot of fun photographing a windy Iowa day. (See my photo under Customer photos here). While I think a .9 would be better for the wind shots, I am very pleased with the results of my first experiment. I can't wait to try it on water. A tripod is a must for these kinds of photos. I am also looking forward to experimenting with panning shots for background blur. The photos I took turned out sharp where needed (Tree trunks). I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of lens. It worked great with my Canon Rebel XT digital SLR."
5,Great product,"I was trying to film a time lapsed subject. Without the filter the image was blown out, but with the filter it was PERFECT. ND filter was easy to use."
4,Not Enough Difference For Non-Professionals,"I was really amazed by the price at first and I had high expectations when I bought it. But, when I actually tested it on my camcorder it did not actually make a whole lot of difference compared to a shot without the filter. And it was a bright sunny day. I thought it would bring the colors to a better contrast or better-looking but all it did on the camcorder was to allow it to have a higher exposure - which can result in a deeper depth-of-field - which makes your movie more focus-centered and look more like a film. My point is what I got was not what I expected.In conclusion, I would say only buy it if you know what to use it for. To me this is professional level stuff so don't even bother if you are just looking for better looking videos for your $300 camcorder. There are other Tiffen filters that will do that."
3,Dirty and Scratched from Amazon,I got this filter from Amazon arrived dirty and scratched. I'm assuming Amazon got it right and if is a manufacturing/packaging issue.
5,Great filter,"Here is an updated review....I have used the filter A BUNCH of times, and it has worked great. It does a good job cutting down (blocking, reducing, filtering...whatever you please) on the harsh light (if you happen to have any...such as sunset photos or photos in snowy situations). It is also does a good job aiding the photographer in those action shots where you want background blurring while the subject remains in focus.Not an expensive filter and worth the money."
3,Filter,Did not get to use it so I do not have any really accurate input. No input. No input. No input.
1,Pointless as a filter - good for protection,"This is just a pointless filter to have. It does very little for my Sigma lens. I keep it on just to keep dirt and other garbage from actually touching the lens. The difference in photographs is so minimal to where it is not really worth the price. If you are worried about protecting your lens, get a filter like this. As for it being a Density filter, I have not seen any results. I have owned other filters but find myself using them less and less since I have really figured my way around LightRoom."
2,Questionable,"Shipping delays aside i returned this because of its condition.It looked almost obviously used, had a scratch on the threads. Needed a severe cleaning at best. Outer edge of filter had indication of usage & prior (attempted) cleaning. Generally in poor shape & possibly the poorest looking filter i've had shipped to me.I tend to doubt the one i recieved was new/unopened retail. I'm not sure what happened. It appears it was originally out of stock & they may have shipped it from overseas. Some one probly just tossed it together.Difficult to say this is a 'review' of the product as i doubt the condition mine showed up in is normal.Can't recommend ordering it from here though."
4,Does the job,"Mother-in-law fell and the rescue team had to break the locks to get in. Since the metal door was pealed from being hit with a hammer this seemed like a cheaper way than replacing the whole door. I carefully measured the distances between the two openings (5.5"") and this fit as advertised. I used a couple of clamps to compress the door together to its (1.75"") and slid the Reinforcer into place. Note insert the replacement locks FIRST.Works and looks great.I got a Kwick-Set replacement lock set with a single key to make it easier for key replacement.You can get this in Stainless and Bronze finishes."
4,Door Reinforcer,"The item we ordered was just a little too small/wrong size for our door. We contacted the company to make arrangements for a return shipment of said item and the company was fantastic. They understood our request and provided us with a return item number and said just send it back via UPS or FedEx. The item itself was wonderful, just what we wanted, unfortunately just a little too small in size. We would not hesitate to order from Belwith Products again in the very near future. Better luck next time!"
1,unbelievable,picture is very misleading. can't believe I paid for two day shipping and got a piece of metal in the mail. I doubt it would even work as a stand for a camera.
5,Great Filter,I have wanted one of these filters and could not find one in any of my local stores. Find this one on Amazon and ordered immediately. I love it. Works like a charm. I have taken some great photos with it.
4,GOOD VALUE - HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME WITH IT YET,"Just received and want to work with it. So far, seems exactly what I wanted. Will try this with flowers to achieve blurred background - bokeh."
5,Captivating,"I am more at home with Maggie Shayne's vampire and witch books, but found myself drawn in by these cowboys of Texas.Very well thought out story lines and amazing character development. I have read all the Brand books now!"
2,"not impressed, better mops on the market","I purchased a ReadyMop about a year ago and haven't been impressed. First of all, I threw the mopping pads out the door after the first use and used regular rags from that time on. They were much more effective at cleaning, not to mention a lot more cost effective.Eventually the weak plastic part on the handle cracked, making the whole handle bend every time I pushed the mop forward. I used electrical tape to barely hold it together until it was replaced.Last, the spray mechanism didn't last long either. I refilled the bottle with a 1:4 vinegar water solution several times, then the venting mechanism stopped working. About every 4 or so sprays I had to open the lid to vent the bottle otherwise it would just drip water out when I tried to spray.I'm replacing this with a Rubbermaid Reveal mop that I saw my sister use. It seems like the handle is a lot sturdier and won't break/bend with use."
3,solution dispenser drips liquid,"I'm not sure if I like it but I already opened it and installed the solution bottle, so I don't think I can return it to Amazon. Also with the pad installed, it doesn't really pick up all the dirt. On top of that, the box says it's safe on wood but does not recommend its use on ""unfinished, unsealed, waxed or oiled hardwood floors,"" which kinda worries me as I'm not really sure whether my hardwood floor falls into any of those categories. Another annoying thing I noticed is that the solution dispenser cannot help but drips some liquid out. very slowly, but dripping nonetheless. Given a choice I would have returned it and tried something else."
3,No pads in my starter kit,"I LOVE this Clorox mop, but I was unable to find it in anly local stores. I was pleased to find it here at Amazon for a good price. I was VERY disappointed to find my package to be incomplete. The 8 pads in this starter kit are missing. I am also diappointed that i can't find a way to email the seller to give them a chance to fix it. Lose/lose."
4,clorox ready mop,"Features I like- ability to dispense as much cleaner as I'd like, ability to use my own washable cleaning pads, ability to refill cleaning dispenser when empty with whatever cleaner I choose. What I wish it had? I wish it had the pivot head that the swisher wet jet had. I miss being able to use the edge as a scrubber. So this cleans well but I still have to get down and scrub occasionally. Overall I'm happy!"
5,Favorite!,"This is my favorite mop by far. I have owned mine for about 5 years, and have used it so much it has broken in a couple of places - nothing that duct tape hasn't been able to handle, and I will not throw it out until I have another, so I'm still using it. I have not been able to find a replacement in stores, so I am so excited to see it on Amazon - I may finally be able to order another! I love how I can refill with cleaners of my choice, and I can use any cloth on the bottom and wash/re-use. It makes the job so much quicker and easier. When I've done some cleaning at family members' homes, I always take my readymop with me, and I will probably be ordering one for them as well!"
1,Defective Product,"I bought my first ready mop system recently and used it once. Not only did the liquid barely clean my floor, I didn't realize for days that the whole bottle of liquid leaked through the nozzle and spilled all over (we're required to install the bottle upside down for dispensing). So I contacted Clorox customer service via email explaining the situation and asking for a new bottle and nozzle. They responded a few days later with surprise that their product was defective. So they only mailed a new nozzle even though I requested a new bottle as well (the bottle probably costs more than the nozzle). Needless to say I tried writing again and now I haven't heard from them at all! I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
3,Buddy Up,"This book was well written, simple to read, full of gay themed experiences but lacked the excitement of many modern day novels. I recommend this a Sunday read not as a nightly cuddle."
3,"Poor volume control, can't tell beat one from beat two in 2/4 time.","The volume control goes directly from inaudible to painfully loud when using an earphone, yet not loud enough when using without an earphone. Can't distinguish the lead beat in 2/4 time. The digital display is not precise, rather seems all over the place with way too large digital dots on each beat. Unuseable. I am looking for a better one right now.Would not recommend."
5,Korg Digital Metronome,"Small, with the appearance of excellent construction, convenient, excellent sound and a very helpful instrument."
3,Better than nothing,"I've used this product for a year or two, since my old Franz LM-FB-4 died.Good: Cheap; light; drop it if you like as it won't break; true pocket-size; headphone jack; batteries last a long time; has tap tempo entry; remembers last tempo when you turn it back on; has basic time signature stuff.Bad: poor ""beepy"" tone; very weak volume (easily drowned out by piano, or even well-struck acoustic guitar); no tempo knob, so to save diddling you'll find yourself using 40, 60, 80, 100, etc. rather than repeatedly hitting the tiny buttons alarm clock-style to get the in-between tempos.Certainly better than nothing. Very handy. Serious musicians will want something better for normal practice, though."
2,"Works as expected, but horrible to listen to","I bought this product online for both the tuning and the metronome functions. These features work well and the device is easy to use, but it sounds TERRIBLE! For one, the metronome tones are at a high frequency which is too close to the range of my violin, no matter how high I turn it up I can't hear the thing above my playing (though my ears start ringing). And the tones that it produces for tuning are too...droning and dull- I normally have a really good ear but for the life of me I can't tune my violin with this thing- if you want to tune your violin stick with a good old fashioned tuning fork."
2,Worked well...but not for long.,"We ordered this item based on other customer reviews. It worked well for about 3 months, but then just quit. We've tried everything, but have had no luck with getting it to start up again. The return window has, unfortunately, slammed shut, making this a waste. Live and learn, I suppose. The product was a good fit for our advanced, intermediate, and beginner level students. Now, the search is on for one that will last a bit longer."
4,"Easy to use, compact","Though I prefer the older ""dial"" metronomes for quick changes in tempo, this Korg is easy to use and shifts quickly between tempi. It also remains on the selected tempo after it is powered off so that you don't have to reset it every time you turn it on. (I found that on a different metronome and hated it!)This is good for students. I am a music teacher and have purchased several of these for beginning music students."
4,Perfect and easy to use,I bought two of these. Both for kids starting music lessons. It's very easy to use. Both kids learned how to use in no time. Volume control is very usefull. Great product.
2,Guitar players: This is not loud enough to hear when you play through an amp,I'm a guitar player and I bought this to be able to hear when I play through my amp. I play my amp at a reasonably low volume - between 2 and 3 on my 100w Twin - and I want a metronome I can hear without headphones. Long story short: this ain't it. I tried using my headphones - good quality ones - and that was ultimately the reason I'm sending it back: the sound of the beat in the headphones is just mono and such a poor sound that it wasn't worth keeping.
2,Annoying sound.,This is a good metronome except for the beat tone. It is a beep when I was expecting a click or a tick. If you don't mind the beeping it will work fine. I am sending mine back.
4,Korg MA30 ultra compact digital metronome,This was purchased for my grandson who is a drummer. He was very pleased with the metronome.
5,Still works like a charm but the price is too high.,Still beeping and alive after 5 years (bought it in 2007). It would be better if it include extra batteries since they charge us so high for a menial product.
1,Useless,"Cons:It is useless because you cannot hear it when you play instruments.Pros:Compact, easily-read display, and low price."
2,"I wanted to give this a better rating, but...","It barely works. I have it a week, and put my headphones into it, and they started shorting out. I tried them with other devices, and they work fine. If I don't press the headphones all the way into the jack, they work great, but if I put them all the way in, the sound goes out completely. If I leave them half out, when I start playing they fall out. This works fine if you don't want to use headphones with it. Otherwise, stay away and find another metronome. I am a long time drummer with experience with lots of metronomes. Spend a little more, and get a little better metronome."
1,"Too quiet, can't change tempo quickly, no light","I play an electric bass and I need to turn down considerably to hear this metronome when practicing. Further, it's takes longer to change tempos on this unit than on a dial unit -- this metronome jumps by 20 bpm when the adjuster buttons are held down, but that takes a second and if you're in between the 20's, you have to back track. Finally, if I need to signal a tempo to my drummer before starting a song, there's no bright light showing the tempo -- and in a bar, he can't hear the clicks on this unit.Avoid this unit if these items are necessary for what you're doing."
2,mediocre,Not the best and not the worst. The biggest disappointment with the MA-30 is not being able to remove the accent from the 1 beat. Also disappointed with how tedious it is to change from a 4 to 3 or 6 count. But it will get the job done.
5,Korg MA-30 Metronome,"This is a great compact metronome. Easy to use...There are several rhythmic options for subdividing the beat, an octave chromatic scale for tuning that may be adjusted to 'Baroque' pitch if you need it or higher [Some instruments, flutes in particular are being tuned to A-442.] There is a volume control and what I like is its ability to move up or down 1 digit at a time. The 'old' metronome moves in increments of '2', '4' & '6'. I have recommended this metronome to my students and they are also happy with it."
5,nice and simple,"This Metronome is easy to use and very user friendly. I was able to figure most of the functions without reading the given instructions. It produce a loud enough beat sound. For the price and quality, it is definitely a good product for general use of a Metronome."
2,Don't go cheap!!!,"Volume is too low, head phone jack is right side mono only, not EZ to change batteries. I will spend a few more dollars next time."
2,Functional,"The Korg MA-30 metronome came recommended by other music teachers, but it is hard to get it loud enough to be heard above the piano. I am disappointed."
4,Great little metronome,"The color of mine is darker and more metalic, which I like. It is a great metronome that I use now everyday for my piano students. However, even with the volume turned up all the way, it is not loud enough for late intermediate students playing ""f"" with the damper pedal. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. However, over all it is a great value."
3,Wanted a click metronome,"I bought this based on at least two other reviews that described the sound it makes as a ""click"". It is not a click it is a high pitched electronic ""beep"". That beep gets lost with notes played by guitar, etc. It also could be louder so I took two stars off for these two drawbacks. Otherwise it keeps time like it is supposed to. Look elsewhere if you wanted a click sound metronome."
2,Not for a banjo player,My problem with this metronome is that it isn't loud enough to cut through the the volume of my banjo. The other issue I have is the tone. The reguarl click is fine but the ping for the downbeat gets lost. It should be a thump not a ping.I can't recommend this.
2,I can't stand the sound.,"If you don't mind a metronome click that is an actual tone (sounds like a high ""D"") you will give this 4 or 5 stars like most people. My old metronome emitted a percussive click which I think is better. If one is playing notes/tones on your instrument and the metronome click is a tone as well I think that isn't good. It is also very annoying. If this is your first metronome it might not bother you."
3,KORG Digital Metronome MA-30 - OK,"Unit is a pretty good bang for the buck metronome. It is easy to use and has several useful patterns in addition to the usual tick tock beat. It is good and loud and has a headphone jack. The only thing I wish it had was an actual LED light to blink with the sound. While the display is pretty cool, it is not backlit and can be hard to see sometimes if the lighting is not right. For this reason I kept my old faithful metronome around for the blinking LED light part."
3,perfict little pacer,My music teacher told me to get a metronome . This one works fine . It was highly rated . And it is eazy to use .
4,Korg MA-30 Metronome,"This is an amazing little metronome that has all the features I could ask for. Headphone outlet, on-off switch, various adjustments etc, etc. There are more features on this little gem that I will ever need. In fact I have not even used most of them.One thing I noticed right away after opening the package is this item is cheaply made. Don't get me wrong, everything works and works properly, it is just that the plastic case is flimsy and appears to be of crude workmanship. Something that I would not expect from the Korg brand name. I suppose they have to cut corners somewhere, considering the retail price of this item.Overall, it does what I wanted it to do and for the money I paid it seems a good value."
4,Metronome,"I am very happy with my Metronome, I purchased it for my daughter's piano practicing. It is perfect and was not too expensive."
2,korg ma-30 metronome,device did what it was supposed to do except would not work in both ears when ear plug was pushed all the way in. seemed very fragile. comapany did not respond to my request to exchange for a new one.
3,Korg MA-30 Metronome,"The Korg metronome MA-30 works well. Really like that you can make it silent and just be able to watch it digitally as you practice. My daughter is using it for piano, clarinet and violin. What I don't like is that its made very cheap for the price! Light weight plastic designed in Japan, made in Vietnam. Is anything made in our country?"
1,Korg Metronome,"Wow, piece of crap. It only plays in one side of the headphones and the volume control is either loud or nothing. Im no businessman but it doesnt seem like anyone should pay 20 bucks for something that beeps with no other good features."
2,Cheap,"I thought Korg would be a great brand to buy, but this metronome is so cheaply made. It looks like it maybe cost them a dollar to make, including the labor. At the highest volume it is just not loud enough to be heard over the piano. It was impossible for me to open just to put the batteries in. My husband, with his stronger fingers had to do it. You have to push in two side tabs and pull apart the two halves of the box to insert the batteries next to the little circuit board. I was worried I would accidentally move something around in there and mess up the whole unit. If I would do it all over again, I wouldn't pay more than about $8 for it."
2,"Even Alkan was a human, and a computer does no justice.","Though a significant improvement over the previous Op.39 album, Nanasakov (or a midi-sequencer and Mr.Nanasawa) is still soulless. The use of a real piano this time significantly makes the performance less unrealistic, but the total absense of emotion makes the recording nothing more than an outlet for some curiosity. It would have been interesting if Mr.Nanasawa himself performed some of the less demanding pieces."
5,Buy this book!,"This book is excellent. Truly gives you a guide and system for working through difficult situations of various kinds. It was entertaining, informative, and definitely worth every penny."
2,Not bright,This product is nowhere near as bright as it is in the picture - it could barely (and I tried) light up a hot tub....
3,Very Small,"This item looks much bigger in the photo than it is in real life. It is approximately 6""-8"" in diameter. We haven't used it in the pool yet (is winter...was family xmas gift) but a leary that it will work in a standard size above ground pool. We did, however, use it as a disco-type light (palced it upside down) so it would make a light show on the walls and ceiling for the kids on New Year's Eve and it was a blast...just a fun idea I thought we would pass along :)"
2,Poor quality and very dim illumination,"Ordered two, one came torn wire where battery connects. Lights are so dim that nothing reflects at pool. Do not waste money buying this product."
1,pretty lights,"not very strong lighting, never got much show in the pool but my granddaughter (8 yo) uses it as a show light for background to put on singing shows"
3,Buy at least 10 of these!,"The range for one of these lights is very minimal, so you need a significant number to have your pool look anything like the picture. I bought two and those do not even light-up half of my pool - and it's not a very big pool!"
2,not what you think,It would be ok for a small pool or hot tub but a 30 x 14 is just can't do the job you see in the pictures. You get what you pay for
3,you would have to buy several to get a good effect,I bought 2 of these for a party. I really needed 4 to get it to look like it looks in the picture. I think each one is good to cover and light about 6 square feet of surface area.
3,One is not enough,"Couple years back I was looking for a Christmas gift for my father who has considerably more money than me and therefor hard to buy for. I came across this inexpensive item and it seemed like a good idea. My father and his wife were very excited about the gift. However, once they placed it in the pool both of us realized that a single light didn't really do much though it still looked nice. This worked out to my advantage in a way. You really need four or five of these units to properly light a normal sized pool. So now I'm on my fourth Christmas and these little lights have turned in to an easy and nice present. My father and his wife take care of these units very well and all three original purchases are still in good working condition.Bottom line: nice cute gift, but you need several to really light a normal sized pool."
1,Very Disappointing,"did not have any effect in my pool which is not that big... very disappointing product, the light was dim and it did not cover the pool, pictures are very misleading"
1,Dont work,Cant see the lights unless its in a baby pool. Like a pool that is two feet deep.Dont buy it unless that is what you plan on using it for
1,Not a chance!,"I have two of these that I bought at a Pinch A Penny. They ARE neat. That is all. They do not light up a pool. They do not light up a porch. They might light up a bathtub, but the colors aren't as cool as the ones in the photo. Total waste of money."
1,Broke within a month,"bought this at a local pool supply shop. Couldn't see the lights during the day so I was waiting for a night swim. By the time I was able to go in at night, it wasn't working. switched out the batteries and it still wasn't working. I've tried letting it dry out for a couple weeks but it is made to break. Please don't waste your money."
1,Not at all like picture shows,"I was very excited to purchase this item for my daugthers birthday pool party... But was very very dissapointed with the result. First it is only visible the absolute darkness, and my pool is 18x36 so it said to get more than 1 so I ordered 2, the lights only shine directly below the floating light... not all over the sides and bottom like the picture shows... I would need 20+ for it to appear like the picture... Don't waste your money"
4,VERY PLEASED!,"I BOUGHT THIS AND I STILL HAVE YET TO HAVE TO TIME TO DO SOME NIGHT SWIMMING ( JUST GOT NEW POOL THIS SUMMER). I HAVE THOUGH AT NIGHT TIME THROWN IT IN AFTER I GOT IT TO SEE IF IT WORKED.IT DOES BUT, IT DOESN'T EXACTLY LOOK LIKE IT DOES IN MY WATER LIKE IT DOES ON THE BOX AND IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, BUT IT'S STILL A COOL CONCEPT I SUPPOSE. PLUS I HAVE A 24 FOOT ROUND AND 4 FOOT DEEP POOL AND THIS LIGHT DOES ONLY 1/4 PART OF MY POOL. IF I REALLY WANTED TO DO IT RIGHT I WOULD PURCHASE AT LEAST 2 MORE TO COMPLETE IT! BUT SEEING AS I HAVE YET TO DO SOME NIGHT SWIMMING, IM NOT REALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT IT!"
4,Not too shabby...,"It was a lot smaller than I realized... but all in all, it works great. We have an above ground pool that is 24 feet across... it light most of it up. It would look a lot better with a second to really light it up at night."
3,NOT TO BAD,"My husband and I have a 22'x52"" pool. I purchased three of these AquaGlow lights for a party we were having. When I first opened them I thought they were awesome, because each top was a different color. One was green, yellow, and orange. The lights are very cool when you have them in a dark room, but not as neat once in water. They only cover about a 5ft circle and do not look like the picture what so ever. They have like 8 different settings for the lights which I thought was cool because it changes the mood. I dont think they are worth $20, but I sure do enjoy having them. You would need 20 colorful floating circles and then it might look like the picture. These can be used for more than just floating in water, but to make a SWEET dance floor in your house for parties."
3,Need more than 1 to make it look like the picture,We purchased 1 of these for our 15 foot above ground pool and I agree with other comments that you need more than 1 to make it look like the picture. I would say you need 4-5 of these. It is pretty cool though when its dark. My son likes to take it into his room and put it on the wall. So i guess there could many uses.
2,Display image very deceptive...,In the display image it appears that the item displays colors all across a rather large pool when in reality it only displays colors in about a 4-5 ft ring around the product.
3,AD A LITTLE DECEPTIVE,have a 16 X 3 1/2 ft pop up pool. it is nothing like the ad shows. i only ordered one andmaybe if i ha 4 or 5 it would look like the ad. i will maybe purchase more of them at a laterdate but no matter what size you pool you need quite a few of these lights. other than that itdoes ok for a light show.
2,small area,"I have an inground pool and even though we do have a pool light I thought the kids would like multi colors. I wasn't thinking it would cover the whole pool but I did think it would cover the size of an above ground pool. NOT the case. It covers a VERY small area and yes it is pretty to look at & has more then one pattern of lights its barely visible,hope this helps anyone looking to purchase."
4,AquaGlow 3555 Pool Light,"This light is for ""pretty"" not for pool illumination! It will provide a little light for a night swim, and does let the swimmer see the pool bottom where the light floats above it. My granddaughter enjoyed it very much in her night swims, but we had 2 of them which helped a little. I would recommend, like others have, that you get 4 or more if you have an 18 ft or larger pool. Just remember, while they are somewhat water proof, they cannot be dunked, or they will leak and ruin everything, especially as the seals age. Also, remember to remove the batteries at the end of swimming season."
3,It will have to wait til summer,It does work but I really can't give a full review until we put it in the pool in June
2,Not what I expected,"I bought it for my in ground pool which is about 10 X 20 feet, and unfortunately it did not work very well... I believe that for my pool I would need 3 or 4 of those to have a nice effect. Also, after approximately 1 week, the green lights just stopped working."
3,Doesn't do the job..,"It may just be the size of our pool, but we found that one just won't do the job, you can barely see it reflected on the bottom of the pool (although it does much better in the spa!). It also stopped working after a couple of uses - it might need good batteries to replace the ones that came with it."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this in hopes that it would show in my little pool but really it is not even a quarter as bright as the pictures. In the pitch black, I can barely see it shining at all."
2,Not so great,"It barely covers a couple feet. You can't even see the lights unless you have every other light in the area off. The pool doesn't show the spots either, just blurred color. Barely. I would not recommend this product."
2,Aqua Glow Underwater Light Show,"I bought this Aqua Glow for my 16 yr old daughhter for X'mas. It was bit of fun for the spa.We have a charcoal pool so the lights don't reflect in our pool. I recommend it if you have a light tiled pool and you would need 2 or 3 units for a disco effect in a large (10 person)Spa.Otherwise it is made of good quality, solid plastic, well sealed from water getting in to the battery unit.A bit of fun!!"
2,Awesome until it doesnt work anymore!,I bought two of these for my hot tub. LOVED them they were a great accent to the nigh time. They last a few weeks then died. I figured it was just the batteries but i tried switching them with brand new ones and NOTHING!! i am sooooooo disappointed because we all really enjoyed them.
4,exactly what everyone else says,It doesn't look nearly like the picture but to me it works perfect for the hot tub. My kids love the colors. Its fairly water resistant. Just don't hold it underwater for a long time. You can splash it and not hurt it though.
5,So much fun,We have a huge in ground pool. About 8-9 feet deep at one end. Bought 2 and they are really fun. Would like to purchase more for next summer. Think about 4 would probably really light it up the whole pool. These are pretty bright and have a few different settings for the light show. Also my cats like them when they are on in the house when they change patterns. haha
3,Under water light show,Don't really know as I gave it as a gift. The persons I gave gift have not commented on how well it works. I know it went in their hot tub.
4,Decent product. Works great under very dark conditions.,"The lights aren't as visible under dim lighted conditions. It's great when it's really dark. Would recommend using at least two or three for a medium to large size pool. When not in the pool, my kids play with this in their room with the lights off. It makes colorful images on the wall. Almost like being in a dance club wilth all the lights. This is alternate fun use of this product."
3,it's ok....,These are wonderful....if you buy a bunch of them. I bought one and it didn't cover the whole pool like it says it does. So I went back and bought 3 more. It looks really neat now but there are 4 of these things floating around in a 10foot round pool.
3,Fun item but could be improved,"I bought this for my parents to use in their hot tub. The light show wasn't anything close to how it is depicted in the ad. It was still fun. Some of the various settings cycle quickly through the different colors like a strobe light. It gave all of us headaches within seconds. The part of the device that is floating out of the water is transparent. This distracts you from the underwater light show. It is this feature that makes the strobe light setting unbearable. The light coming from the top is blinding.Now for the positive: If this is being used in a hot tub, the light provided from the AquaGlow is more muted than the light installed in the hot tub. It makes for a more relaxing environment. Again, don't expect the underwater show to look anything like the picture but with that in mind, I'd say it is worth it. My family puts it on every time we go in."
1,Nowhere Near to what it promised to be!,"I read all the other reviews, and all I can say is that this product is just plain and simple JUNK! I have a pool of 18x36 feet, and when you place this floater in it, nothing happens at all! The depth of a normal pool prevents this device from projecting the colors to the ground. Don't get fooled by this picture in the advertisement. It is completely misleading! In the shallow end, where the depth is about 2 feet, you could make out some dingy, tiny circles, and over a surface of maybe ONE square foot!!! What a disappointment!20 bucks to waste is maybe not the end of the world, but to me, it is, because I hate being ""taken"". So beware! Keep your money for something useful!"
1,OK for a kiddie pool,"I saw the pictures, read the reviews and couldn't wait to see the light in action. Disappointment with a capital ""D""! The range of the projected lights was 1.5' in diameter - maybe 2', which is fine for your average kiddie pool but for a large, adult-sized pool - plan on buying 15-20 of these to get the effect shown in the pictures. In my opinion this product was grossly misrepresented!!"
1,Disappointed,Picture does not look anything like shown. We only have a 16 foot pool andwould probably need at least four more to look even close to picture. Very disappointed.
2,ummm... no......,"Don't believe the photo showing the light effects. It in NO way fills the entire pool with such full circles of light. Just a small area, very little dots and you need complete darkness to see anything. Big let down this product is. Maybe use in a bathtub for the kids... seriously poor product."
4,terrific nightlight - pretty good pool light,"My kids love thing in their room - a very cool science fiction style effect at night. I put it in the pool one night. My pool is 15' wide an 4' deep. As others have mentioned, it is not bright enough, nor does it cast a wide enough image to remotely fill the full area of the pool. I think 3-4 four of these would create something like the effect in the photo. However, by itself, it wasn't bad - actually it was kinda fun spinning it and pushing it around the pool in darkness.So I give it four stars, because I more than got my money's worth for it, as a nightlight for the kids. The minus-one is for the false impression given by the product photo."
2,"Light, what light?","I live in a pitch black country town. I still could not see the light in the pool. It was more like a blur of lights. Not worth the money. However, it does work in the bathtub for the kids. Nice way to get them in the tub."
1,Thanks to photoshop,"Don't expect to see the beautiful colors shown in the pictures of the product on internet....That's 100% photoshop....In the real world the light is weak ...I tried to use it in my SPA (2m x 1,8m) but the AquaGlow batteries loose connection if there's any vibration...if it moves, the light will turn off...No, I don't recommend it to a friend....."
3,AquaGlow3555,"I bought 2 AguaGlow units for a pool party and I was a little disappointed. It doesn't give off much of a light show like the picture. In fact, you can only really see the lights in the shallow end of the pool when it's completely pitch dark."
4,fun!,"Doesn't cover the entire pool, but I put mine in the hot tub and it's perfect! Also, it's really fun to go into a dark room in the house and watch the light show. I would recommend it to anyone with a small pool or hot tub."
2,Not as cool as it looks,i order two light a big and a small one and they barely make a difference in my pool. i put them in for my house warming party and it didnt catch anyones eye! not what i expected...and i am going to get my money back.
4,Great product....,"Look, for the price it is a wonderful product. As the picture shows you will need a few of them in your pool if you are looking for the full lighting effect. My pool is 15x30 and I have about five of them and it look great. They seem durable and made well. I used them often. I like the fact that after an hour they turn off (one less thing I need to worry about)."
3,Just OK,"I have a very large pool and I think I would need at least 4 more to make it look cool. The red color does not show up at all, good concept, but LOTS of room for improvement."
5,Top US Progressive DJ takes listener on memorable journey,10 top progressive tracks mixed to perfecton by one of Americas top djs. Not a bad track in the bunch.
1,Performance slowly faded in 1 year,"Purchased in 2010 from Amazon. After a few months noticed it wasn't picking up any longer. Found that the tube from the rug beater portion to the bag was clogged (its small compared to other vacs). Cleaned it out, but it still doesn't work as it did in the first few months. Disappointed, should last longer than 12 months."
2,Too many headaches...,"I purchased two of these vacuums about 4 months ago. One is still working fine, the other one had a switch go bad within 30 days - so I was able to return it to Amazon. I purchased the exact same one with the refund money thinking I must have just gotten a dud... now it has quit working all together, and we're outside the 30 days for Amazon. We have to take it to a local service center. For only being a little over 3 months old - it has not met my expectations."
3,Good with some flaws,"My mom has an oreck, which she loves. I have used it several times and liked to too. This one I am on the fence about. It easy to move and cleans great. However, I have found several flaws in it. It arrived in a damaged box, and the handle was sticky and the outer bag was wet. Bags are hard to install. They have put a thick and heavy cord on the back that causes it to fall over easily. The cord is way too long! I trip over it every time. The cord also makes it much heavier then I expected. There is no hose, so vacuuming the steps is a hassle. Not sure I can recommend this to anyone."
5,Love It!!,"This vacuum is awesome! It is lightweight, picks up dirt on carpets of any height with no adjustment and also goes to bare floors with the same ease! This is my 4th Oreck, I own and operate my own cleaning business, and the 3rd Commercial, but this one is definitely the way to go. 2 speeds makes it easier to get that dirt on delicate floors. You can't go wrong with this item for the price!"
1,Almost caught on fire,"Today my wife was vacuming when suddenly smoke and noise erupted from the vacuum and a hole was burned in the side of the hood. Scary to say the least. She was only glad she was at the helm and not one of the visiting granchildren. This is her fourth Oreck and she always loved them, but is now afraid to use this machine even if it gets repaired. Dealer volunteered to recycle. Thanks a lot."
1,Oreck needs to step up and build a better vacuum,"The vacuum bag will not stay on , poor pick up, makes excessive noise . We are now using a Riccar vacuum and itworks great."
2,This item weighs 10 lbs with the cord,This item is very close to other Oreck Vac that appear this as this product. It just happens to be red. It is called commercial because it comes with a thick long cord that looks like a commercial extension cord and weighs like one. It is NOT 8 lbs if you include the cord. You cannot operate the vacuum without the cord. Cord was cumbersome to use.
3,Oreck Vacuum,We have 2 Orecks which we have had for years and really really like their performance and their light-weightedness.We bought this one for our mother... surprisingly we had some problems with it and got 'danced around' a bit between the manufacturer and the 3rd market seller. The 3rd Market Seller finally replaced it after a lengthy 'rig-a-mo-rol'. If Amazon had NOT been involved we would not have faired as well.Amazon's monitoring of 3rd party service to Amazon clients truly makes a HUGE difference.KUDOs to AMAZON!
1,Catches on fire,"I own the Oreck xl and it almost burnt my house down, while vacuuming the handle caught on fire, that is were the wiring is attached to the motor, don't anticipate any help from Oreck customer service-thieves"
4,Great but loud vacuum,"This vacuum has all of the good qualities everybody is lauding. the long cord is handy. It's light weight. It cleans great. However, it is easily the loudest piece of equipment in our house... or garage. It sounds like a jet engine with a loose bearing."
2,Oreck upright Vacuums - Odor from bag,"If you have pets, this is not the vacuum for you. Regardless of which bags you use, and even if you replace the disposable bag after each use, there will be a smell, (maybe as a result of pet hair even though our dog is a non-shedding breed) which permeates from the bag each time you vacuum. Oreck tells us you can wash the bag but due to the plastic that is attached, you cannot put the bag in the washing machine. We have washed it by hand several times but no matter what we try, the odor remains. The vacuum does a good job of gathering dirt, pet hair, etc., but the odor causes it to be a real detriment. I do not recommend any of the Orecks with cloth bags as all have the same problem.. and it does not make any difference if you use hypo allergenic bags or cheap bags, the result is the same."
5,A MUST HAVE CD.,"I bought this cd, POLYMATH, when I saw the band live in concert. If you like American Hi-Fi, Blink 182, Train, etc.You will love this band. Great songs, that stick in you head!If they come to your town, you must see them. A GREAT SHOW!Also, request them on your local radio. They are making it big and buy this first cd, so you can have the limited edition now!Merri Orr"
3,lacking,"I can't believe Amazon is selling this for almost $70 when I bought one from Wal-Mart a little more than a year ago for less than $30 and others just like it on Amazon (although different colors) are also going for less than $30. What makes blue so special?Comparing it to another mp3 player my other daughter received for Christmas, this model is inferior. For starters, it doesn't have an external display. The other drawback is its 2.5mm headphone jack. Apparently standard size is 3.5mm. If ours came with an adapter, I didn't know...or we lost it. If you find yourself needing new headphones and have lost your adapter (or didn't get one to begin with), you'll be hard pressed to find 2.5mm headphones or you'll have to go to Radio Shack and buy a new adapter like we did.If I knew then (when I bought it) what I know now, I'd buy an mp3 player with an external display and a standard 3.5mm headphone input."
4,clip runner,Real good product. works as advertised. Read instructions before use and you should be fine with it. I use for running and the clip feature is great. I also have the 2gb clip unit which works even better.
2,"great if first one, not for current I-POD owners","I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for my daughter when her IPOD shuffle was stolen. Bad mistake. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little mp3 player. The problem is that all of my daughter's music is under I-Tunes, which formats music that you legitimately own in such a way that you can only copy the music over to an IPOD. Anything that's not an IPOD will read the music as copywrited and will not play the music.If you're not using I-Tunes, buy this, you'll like it.If you already use I-Tunes, don't buy this."
3,The Camping Trip Went Wrong,"""A Taste of Smoke"" by Marion Dane Bauer is a pretty good book. It's about an adventurous thirteen year old girl named Caitlin. She is looking forward to a camping trip with her sister. First, a guy named Alex, shows up at their campsite, and she knows Pam planned it. Caitlin decides to take a bike ride on the path, and on the way back, she meets this boy, who appeared out of no where. His name is Frank, and he helps Caitlin back to her campsite. The weird part is that no one but Caitlin can see or hear Frank. If you like adventure, I reccomend this book to you!"
3,"Basic bloops and beeps, but a lot of fun","It is full of simple looped techno beats but I always find one really interesting track that stands out in my purchases. In this case, my favorite is ""Mystery Cafe"", which samples dialog from a noir movie with basic techno drumbeats and some keyboards, kinda as if the soundtrack to Casablanca was remixed by Moby. This track reminds me of work being done by The Grid at the same time. I always wanted to try and build it as a test of how good I was with samples...I figured I could put something similar together in a few hours. I never did, but I still enjoy this collection. So, yeah, if you like old Moby, you'll like this."
2,Tiffen 52mm Neutral Density 0.3 Filter,"I love the Tiffen brand. Unfortunately I bought the wrong size, but even so, the 0,3 is very weak. My camera has even some difficulty in sense this filter. I think you'll have better results with the 0,6 and 0,9."
3,I think I need one of these...,"Has anyone tried this?I have a problem with a video projector that is too bright for rear projection; despite running it under Theater mode and lowering the brightness as far as the Epson S1 allows. I'm hoping that one of these filters...probably the .3 version...will cut the brightness down yet retain the colors while reducing the annoying light spot bleeding through the screen. I just have to figure out a way to hold the lens at the proper distance from the front of the projector so it doesn't interfere with the projected image. The larger filter size would be more flexible, but the trade-off is expense. I thought a 58 might work well, but I have to check what my old 35mm lens will accept. Might as well get something I could use with my film camera, and I think I remember having a 58mm wide angle lens.Update: still waiting for this item to ship, but I did end up buying a 55mm size that will also fit my wide angle SLR lens."
1,Fraudulent Advertisement - Don't buy from this seller!!!,"Read the fine print carefully on this advertisement. It lists 24 packs of 24 strips, 144 strips total. 24 x 24 is NOT 144 strips. You will get only 6 packs of 24 strips, which is the 144 strips, but this seller is charging WAY too much for 6 packs. You will find it for much cheaper in your local store."
4,Reliable and versatile,"When our old vibrator broke years ago, we bought this one because the price was right. (Money was tight then.) The vibrator is small, 5"" as it says above, which is OK. The problem is that the maximum speed is somewhat low: pleasing but not great. On the positive side, one AA battery does last for many uses, and it is so well made, that it gave us years of carefree use. Also, its small size allows it to be strategically placed during that special one-on-one time.So, if you want a small, reliable vibrator, perhaps for your first one, then this is the one to get. We give it 4 stars for its reliability and versatility.(Review of Sinclair Institute Better Sex Sheer Lady Finger Vibrator Massager)"
5,A needed restoration and re-discovery,"It's really a shame that such an excellent movie has been so poorly handled over the decades. Now, fortunately, Criterion has put really fine work into bringing this film back to life. It was a surprise when they (Criterion) announced that they would release this movie produced by Paramount Pictures (and owned for years by Universal) -- I thought that the best we might get would be a low-end-burn-on-demand version from Universal Pictures. The announcement (of a high definition Blu-ray) from Criterion made me and many fans very happy."
4,Music To My Ears!,"""Island of Lost Souls"" was something of a last hurrah for legendary new wavers Blondie, rating their last Top 40 hit before the group reformed in the late Nineties and scored a massive hit with the plaintive ""Maria."" Taken from the underrated HUNTER lp, ""Island"" continues the Caribbean flavour of the earlier ""Tide is High,"" albeit with diminished success. Still, the single is great fun and is a must for any Blondie fan's collection."
1,Criterion has done nothing to justify the cost of this movie.,I have several bootleg copies of this classic including my own conversion of vhs to dvd. I can see no difference between these and the Criterion blu-ray release that costs almost $25.00. Surely Criterion could have at least gotten a decent Universal print to work with. At least that much effort. At the very least don't spend a bunch of money on the blu-ray since it could not possibly be any better than the dvd.
4,A Superb Horror Film,"What distinguishes this film are the remarkably atmospheric cinematography, the ceaselessly inventive camera angles, and the high production values for the set. Fine acting too. Still vital and stylish 60 years later."
4,One of the greats!,"Even after almost seventy years, Island of Lost Souls is still able to shock and mystify. Extremely atmospheric sets and lighting, good pacing, and grand performances by Laughton and Lugosi make this one to put on the shelf besides such classics as Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man. A classic."
4,ARE WE NOT MEN?,"Atmospheric thiller from Mr. Kenton. Laughton, one of the finest screen actors ever is fun to watch wether he is or is not over the top. The intensity of this actor is off the charts.His film legacy is stunning, you cant take your eyes off of him..even though he no notable features.Lugosi plays it for real in a somewhat campy arena.. From "" The Big Clock"" to "" Les Miserables"" to The Hunchback"" Laughton reigns supreme"
3,Not Bad,"This film is probably the best out of the three adaptations. I am a big fan of the book, though, and the film missed a lot of what the story was really about, as films tend to do.The performances were top notch and the film delivered what it set out to, a chilling horror of its time."
3,interesting early horror,"i wanted this classic horror film for a long time and it was finally released on DVD. upon my first viewing of this movie, i must admit was both impressed by some aspects but disappointed by others. the premise was very intriguing but the actual screenplay was a bit too lumbering. it seemed to rely too heavily on suggestive innuendo rather than stark depiction. i realize this was probably due to the era in which it was filmed. i suppose i just overexpected due to the fact it was released prior to the censorship code. it did have some strong morbid overtones, especially the subject of the panther woman. very wierd and almost sickening.the dvd itself, although showing signs of age in the picture, was quite good considering the film is over 80yrs old. the audio is also very good."
3,Great movie - grainy transfer,"Kudos to Criterion for tackling this title. Shame on them for botching it. There are better source materials and they didnt get them.I always brag on Criterion. When i saw they were releasing ""Island of Lost Souls"" I ecstatically did something i never do - i pre-ordered. When it arrived i arranged a showing with friends. My heart sank.The quality is not only sub-par Criterion - it's sub-par by any standards. I ordered the standard release by mistake, so maybe the Blu-Ray is better, but since the soure materials are the same, i'm not optimisitc.I found some solace in the wonderful commentary from Gregory Mank plus the feature with comments from David J. Skal - - but what in the world are John Landis, Rick Baker and Bob Burns doing besides chatting like three mildly bored pals about a movie they know very little about. Landis has nerve busting on director Earl Kenton. Dont throw stones, ex-movie director."
3,We Don't Need No Stinking Logo!,"Thank You ""Composer"" for your review. I saw this movie in the 70's and enjoyed it very much. However, I do not remember any Godzilla Logo in the original movie. I will not buy it until I know the logo has been removed. If Godzillaflix will state on their web site (I will check periodically) or on this Amazon site that the logo has been removed, I will buy the movie. If companies that manufacture DVD's are allowed to get away with this it will only get worse. I will check for 90 days. If Godzillaflix does not confirm that the logo has been removed, I will buy the VHS version and wait for a different company to issue the movie on DVD."
1,NOT the Roman Catholic Version,"I bought the Kindle edition for my daughter who is preparing for her first communion. I wish I hadn't. This isn't the version we say at Mass... It mentions the ""remission"" of sins and uses antiquated forms like ""spake throughout the prophets"" and ""proceedeth"" instead of "" proceeds."". I think this may be the Anglican version. And as others have mentioned the word ""holy"" does not appear in the line about the Church.Even more annoying, the Kindle version has been converted to black and white! I was quite surprised to see the dull gray illustrations on my iPad. Recommend for those who are both Protestant AND color blind. All others are likely to be disappointed."
2,"NOT Titanium, NOT colors as in photos","I was excited when received my new ""Invicta Men's Elite Titanium Watch #9537"" from Amazon, but then I was extremely dissapointed, the watch must be either Titanium PLATED or Titanium COLOR, but it was NOT Titanium, you can instantly obviously tell by the weight (I have a couple Titanuim watches).Also the nice rich color depicted in the ad photo was NOT what the watch actually looked like in real life, it was VERY dissapointing!BUT... I have to tell anyone reading this....AMAZON WAS WONDERFUL!They returned the watch ASAP with only a very minor s/h fee.I was very happy with the way Amazon treated me, I will DEFINETELY buy from then again and again!"
1,Buy the extended warranty,After owning this watch for just two months the date indicator stoped turning and will not turn manualy. Amazon would not take care of an exchange because it is over 30 days so I am now having to ship the watch back to the manufacturer. I am not pleased with Amazon's short 30 return/exchange policy or with the fact the watch has failed already. It is a good looking watch. Hopefully the manufacturer will be easy to work with. But now I have to pay to ship it back and who know what else.
3,not enough history,"The book is divided into history, select documents, and essays. However, the history starts with 1976. Surely, this is a mistake, when it is obvious that there have been many homosexuals who contributed to the growth of Christianity over the centuries. These accounts of gays and lesbians working within their denominations to be able to fully participate in their faith completely disprove the allegations that gays are trying to destroy the church. This book is much more about individuals than organizations. Interesting discussion of what is required to make a marriage work. Good bibliography, index, 216 pages."
3,"Nice Book, But Not Always Accurate!","This is a great book for the most part. However, there are some horrible inaccuracies and mis-information. The sections regarding New York City Brewing History are the worst. For instance, the author indicates that the Ruppert and Rheingold Breweries were always the same (Rheingold actually took over Ruppert in the early 1960's). The section titled ""New York's Big Three"" should actually be ""New York's Big Four"" (Ballantine, Schaefer, Rheingold/Liebmann, and Ruppert (Knickerbocker).This book is a good overview of many beers and brewers, but is not a complete history by any stretch. Still, it does wet your appetite for a more complete North American Brewing History.The pictures are great, particularly the beer labels. But even here some of the labels are grouped with the wrong brewer.All in all a good book and a plesant reading experience. But brewing history purists will have to take it with a grain of salt."
5,Buy This Video and hope for An Update Too.,"I bought this documentary in 1994, and I absolutely LOVED IT!!!! I STILL like it a lot, as I'm never about to give up my IG videos, it includes a year book you can click on, and you'll get a bunch of snippets of interviews, and shows that was probably used as a promo you know ?The one thing I'm terribly missing, and am waiting for......an update! They could call it Watershed 2: 25/or whatever years Together or something. How does that sound ? I really wish theywould update the info in this.Otherwise I really like this, it's fun to watch the Galileo video!! Although I understand Amy, I do think she's alittle hard on Catholic priests.In the Galileo Video she writes,""I was a priest.....I thought about God and sex all the time.""If you want to see Amy breaking strings during ""Land of Canaan"" of all times, and having to change guitars mid song while ""singing"" throughout, just BUY this video, because THAT IS CLASSIC,AND FUNNY AS HELL!!!."
3,A weak case for Hamilton as a general,"As a semi official biography (the authors' wife wrote the biography of Sir Ian's wife!), the book tries a tad too hard to polish the tarnished reputation of Sir Ian Hamilton, arguably one of the more infamous Great War generals, and an abject failure at that. This attempt to burnish Hamilton's grotesque incompetence as a general, and his all too typical and familiar British way of generalship in chateaus (in his case, luxury liner) miles behind/away from the front, hands off attitude regarding operations and intrigues aginst colleagues, just come across as pathetic."
4,"Good, but I'd much rather listen to Undertow","It's a good album, but please, stop calling it the greatest album to ever grace the Earth. It's not the greatest thing, but it's still good.I really miss Paul's bass, but overall, the whole package is very good. The vocals are probably what sold me on Tool back when Undertow was first released, and Maynard's voice isn't given enough ""room"" so to speak. His voice is drowned out a lot, which is really a shame. If you want real Tool, go listen to Undertow. Don't listen to this expecting hardcore metal, or you will be sorely disappointed."
5,Tools Best,A classic.Tool are some of best song writers ever. When you think of Tool you think of this Album. A lot better then Undertow. From Stinkfest to Third eye Theres not one song I dont like. Its lyircally a masterpiece. The music is so origanal. Something no rip off bands like Ear Shot will ever come close to. Tool have made place in music history.
5,Incredible to say the least,"Tool is not your average band. Anyone who listens to tool quickly goes to lateralus saying it is their best album. Lateralus is an increible album but aenima has so much more meaning to it and aenima is also the album where they started to explore their sonic template. This album also has many themes to it as well that make it an incredibly well thought out album. Songs such as eulogy and pushit are songs that show tool's more aggresive side but then you have songs like stinkfist that ate about compasion and third eye, a song about drug abuse. This album really made tool shine, to say the least it is an absolutly amazing album that i would recomend to anyone"
4,Case cracked,"The cd was still wrapped and new, but there was a small crack on the bottom of the cd case."
5,"No other album before or after has came close,","Masterpiece start to finish, For my money this cannot be beat. listen carefully to the lyrics. think about them, ""read between the lines"" LOL"
5,Wonderfully progressive,"It just cant go wrong with Tool.It does take a while to get into the songs though, many listens. But its so worth it in the end! Once you really get to know the sounds, the lyrics, the meaning.. Its really something special that I have never in my 20 years as a prog metal fan, experienced before.Favorite songs are H. , Aenema, Stinkfist."
5,A CD from a great band without boundaries!!,"This CD represents what every artist strives for. Well, at least those who are true to themselves as well as the music. It is a journey into the mind and soul, a discovery and realization of who we are. Powerful and hypnotic, it has been a huge influence to my own songwriting. I can only hope HYALINE makes music that is as inspiring and real in character. This album represents what has been lost in many of today's bands. A no-holds-barred courageous approach to art and self expression. It is only when we let go of fear and stand naked in front of the crowd that we truly expose the soul."
5,Greatest Tool Album Ever!!,"Aenima is DEFINITLY the greatest Tool album iv ever heard! EVERY singe track is great, i dont not like one track. I reccomend this cd to ANY Tool fan. I dont think Tool could have made a better album then this one. so if your looking for a great cd to buy, This is it!"
1,I think that the CD is way overrated,"All of the songs are at least ten minutes long. I really think that the guys from Tool should write shorter songs. There is one song that rules, that is Eulegy."
1,Self-fulfilling prophecy,"This is music? This torrid piece of filth could well be the 90s answer to Emerson, Lake and Palmer. There is not a trace of intelligence in any lyric, the music is merciless sludge, and the album consists mainly of filler.I know, because I've listened to it many times. This is one of my friend's favorites, for whatever reason, and she saw fit to make me listen to it. In fact, she saw fit to make me STUDY it. So I listened to each song multiple times and analyzed her printed lyrics. I came to the conclusion that it was almost entirely without worth. THEN I got to listen to the entire 76 minute torturous sprawl. Several times. (All for you, I! Never say I'm not a true friend. I even tried my best to like your favorite parts!)""Eulogy"" (which is decent for what it is) says it best for Mr. Keenan and his merry band: ""He had a lot of nothing to say."""
1,"Boring, uninspiring, way overrated noise!","To call 'Aenima' or any of Tool's work hard rock or metal (as many have) is an insult to talented and real hard rock or metal bands. 'Aenima' is too experimental and dissonant to even be placed in this genre. Just because a band muffles and adds effects and blurbs and grunts to their lead vocals and does stupid things that most bands don't, and throws in a few unexpected riffs and time changes in the process does not good music make. This is not 'pioneering' or 'groundbreaking' in the least folks! It is directionless, uncohesive art. For those of you who actually paid money for 'Aenima'..."
5,"Aenima is a true masterpiece, an extremely original cd","Aenima contains some of the greatest songs out there. Tool uses different sound distorting objects to change Maynard Keenan's powerful words. the guitarist is not bland and boring, in most of the songs, he will change the whole song around, and even tricked me into thinking that it was a completely different song. Excellent cd, it's way up there on my list."
5,the greatest c.d. on earth,"the maynard is using really great volcals pounding drums, adam is an amazing guitarist. this album has great lyrics has great music it's great all around."
5,unbelievable,"Never has there been a band that was able to play with such intensity and subtlety at the same time, without ever sounding boring, repetitive, or trite. Absolutely amazing. And to that guy who gave it 1 star and said that Tool needs to write shorter songs; do us all a favor, kill yourself. Put a gun in your mouth or smoke a tail-pipe or something, you're what's wrong with America. Shorter songs. Jesus Christ, u even spelled ""Eulogy"" wrong and that was the song u said u liked. Not to mention the fact that ""Eulogy"" is 8 minutes 28 seconds, that makes it a pretty long song in my book. That's not important though, the important thing is that u kill yourself as soon as possible. E-mail me your address, I'll send u a gun. I trust you'll do the right thing."
2,"So close, but....","With my love for Undertow aside, I'd say buyer-beware on Aenima. First, there's a different bass player on this CD, hence that deep-digging, heavy bass is nearly absent entirely!! Did they think we wouldn't notice? (That was the back-bone of Undertow!) And if you listen closely you can hear the lead guitar wandering to fill in the vacant bass licks (this, in turn, steals from the guitar parts). Trust me. Also, the production is spongy and flat. And the songs wander way too much. Just when you think they're finally going to nail one, they digress, again and again and again. Very frustrating. I guarantee you will not sit through this CD from top to bottom. Strangely enough, their brightest point is also their biggest departure, ""Hooker"" is extremely powerful, albeit different. If you're not a diehard fan, skip this CD, you WILL hate it. As for Tool, can you get that bass player back?"
3,"great, but a little dissapointing also","I love Tool. Undertow is by far the best Tool album ever. This having been said, Aenima is also a very good album, however it doesn't quite live up to the standards that were set by Undertow. The problem here is that the album is simply too...long. Some of the tracks just go on for too long, and while Maynard's voice helps to keep it somewhat interesting, it ends up just being physically draining to listen to this album all the way through. There are however, some fantastic moments on this album, and no Tool fan should be without it. However, casual fans should stay away, because they will be dissapointed."
2,"Jesus, people, it isn't THAT great . . .","What the hell . . .there's GOT to be someone out there that doesn't like this band. Aenima has two good songs - Die Eire Von Satan and Stinkfist. The rest of it is average heavy radio grunge, nothing more. These guys are out to shock rather than musically impress. To me, if you've heard one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. It amazes me that people consider these guys ""deep and emotionally moving"". I find them fairly one dimensional; a band like Mr. Bungle outclasses these guys in originality AND depth by light years. It also amazes me that people call this band ""metal"". Every song from Undertow and Aenima is the same riff played in a different time signature. Then again, this is the nineties, the only decade that's musically WORSE than the eighties. With so much garbage out there, no one from this unadventurous generation is motivated to explore groups that crush this sorry band and no one wants to."
1,"""The Sound of a Thousand Dirt Bikes"", ""Monster Truck Tunes""","""What A Bloody Bore"" I thought to myself and sent about fifteen pieces of hate drenched rubbish hurtling into the trash. Some obscure form of Redneck Entertainment also crossed my mind. On a lighter note, it's just so tasteless.And this is coming from someone who can even handle the ""Dead Kennedys."" At least there is some humor and political sentiment. Gothic Metal Bands are a much more mindful alternative to this ceaseless tirade of grating noise.If the music only matched the artwork that created the covers."
1,This CD sucks.,"There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely."
1,Lame poser metal,"I was listening to a metal radio station and the DJ was talking about how awesome Tool were so I downloaded this album to check them out. WOW. They're awful. ""Pretentious"" and ""tedious"" would sum up this album. The only cool thing is the computerized vocals. All of the musicians, especially the drummer, sound like they just came out of their first instrument lesson. Horrid musicianship. Skip this lame poser metal and listen to 30 Seconds To Mars, new Metallica, Staind, System Of A Down, etc."
1,I Don't Get It....,"Why do soo many people like this album? Okay, its better than Eminem (thats not saying much at all) but its just not that great. I've tried and I've tried to like it, but I just can't. I geuss the best thing to do is to listen to REAL metal instead (indeed this is NOT real metal)."
2,Don't wast your money and time,"I think 2 stars is generous..There are only about 1 mabye 2 good ""songs"" / Noise tracks on this album the rest suck and I'm really sorry I wasted my time and money on it."
5,Music for musicians...,"This album is one of the best releases ever, in any genre of music. I don't say this with a completely untrained ear. I listen mainly to jazz and classical -- my favorite recording of all time is ""Kind of Blue"" by Miles Davis. Innovative guitar and bass work supports Danny Carey, who may very well be the best drummer in rock & roll. Many of the songs are in odd time... bars of 5/4, 6/8, and 7/4 are not at all uncommon. Maynard's lyrics are just great. ""Hooker w/ a Penis"" makes one of the best statements about shameless commercialism and marketing that I have ever heard. This cd may be difficult to swallow without some basic knowledge of music theory, but it is worth every penny.-And after you get Tool, Go buy Miles Davis!"
5,FINALLY AN ORIGINAL BAND,I first heard tool on the radio and i have to admit i was a bit skeptical because they sounded a little bit Nine Inch Nails and i wanted something new and original not another clone.So i went out and bought it anyway . It turned out to be one of the greatest cds ive ever heard second to only dark side of the moon by Pink Floyd. This cd is full of genuine talent from Maynards vocals to the continuous heart pounding drums. Unlike most cds i own i listen to this one over and over because every song is great . The only problem with this cd is that there are to many interludes and skits. But other than that this cd is perfect!
1,Vinyl FAKES and BOOTLEGS sold on Amazon,A helpful hint for anyone looking for an ORIGINAL vinyl copy of Aenima: ALL the colored vinyl copies are fakes. The original was only pressed on black vinyl. Hope that keeps a few of you from getting ripped off...
1,Only For Hard Core Listeners Who Want Test Their Musical Limits.,"This is a wicked, torturing and awful experience! I would rather go to dentist without anaesthesia which is by the way the great Metallica's song comparing to every song here in Aenima. Even the animals can't listen this without suffering.Tool is the most overrated band of the 90s and 00s!Sorry, all 5 stars givers but everyone has the right to tell here his/her own opinions. Someone likes Backstreet Boys and others Red Hot Chili Peppers. There are also many people who likes TOOL. I can't undestand that but let it be so..."
1,The worst album of all time!,This is terrible! This album should be forbidden! THIS IS AWFUL! I wan't able to listen to it through!
1,omg,"omg this is so crappy i mean it s not even music its just wierd noises, and who makes a 11 minute song? really cmon. anyway my true opinion on this is that who ever likes it doesnt know music because it sucks, if you want real music try good charlotte or simple plan at least they can play their instruments. i am sick of people saying this is music ""oh tool are cool"" no their not!!AIM screen name is: yoohooscoobydoo"
4,"Net net, it rocks.","EULOGY's layered climb from a patient wood block riff up to the all-out ""I'm pissed at the world"" melody is among the most engaging songs I've heard. Qunitessential Tool... DIE EIER VON SATAN, on the other hand, makes me want to vomit. It's like someone came into my home, ripped the headphones off my head, and thrust me into a Nazi youth rally (though in fairness, I do not understand the lyrics). It makes Rammstein sound like the Vienna Boys Choir."
1,Primitive and simple sounds ruin this promising album,"I could hear better music on a National Geographic special of Africa. This shows no progression from their last release, Undertow. Not worth the money."
2,"Underneath it all, dull and unoriginal","Forget all the packaging, ranting, raving, swearing and sonic gizmos. This is actually an unadventurous, largely uninteresting, predictable rock album. I'd retitle it: ""More of What We Think You're Expecting."""
1,Ditto Ellis,This broke my CD player when I first tried to play it! And THEN I had to listen to the thing!
1,"Talentless, way overrated DRIVEL.","I cannot believe some find musical redemption in TOOL's music, if that's what you want to call it. Under the guise of 'groundbreaking' (which 'Aenima' is not) or 'unique' (which 'Aenima' is, but this does not mean it's good), many 'Toolies' have blindly followed suit, and elevated the band to godlike status. 'Aenima' is dissonant, unpleasant, and directionless to say the least, and their music is simply terrible! The degree to which the latest generation has embraced 'Tool' is more a testament to their awful taste in rock music, as well as proof that the record industry has succeeded in lowering their standards bigtime! This release is a total DUD!"
1,tol is bad,its bad dont buy it they cuss and shouet bad words. the gutar player hurts my ears. i dont like the cover they are scary. they arenet like Britny or Chrstian Agulera. the only song i like is the one with the piano and the seegulls but the man curses i turn in off when he starts swering just dont by it its bad for you
2,Tool? Heavy metal?,"Stinkfist:excellent song....rest of the album...what the f***? How can this band be compared with Korn and System of a Down? Ok, it's rock music, but it ain't as heavy as some people make out"
3,Good but has lost some polish over the years,"I was introduced to Tool with Lateralus, which I liked a lot. Then came 10,000 Days which I absolutely loved. At this point, I felt it was time to go back and get nima, which I had heard many fans claim as their favorite.In my opinion, this is a solid album but doesn't live up to the two works of art that would come afterwards. The guitars in particular are far too muddy to appreciate. When you compare them to the clear, crisp sounds on 10K Days, there just isn't any comparison. Also, the filler between each song gets old after one listen. Seriously, tracks 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 are all wastes of time. I have heard some fans complaining about the filler on 10K Days, but it is nothing compared to nima.I'm sure this album was revolutionary when it came out 10 years ago, but to be introduced to it today after hearing Lateralus and 10K Days is a disappointing experience."
3,nearly perfect surf INSTRUMENTALS,"SOUND GOOD here , like THIS WAy..the music we were born to play like INFANTILE exuberhent,insane AT angst INSECT LIFE SWARM ALTHOUGH THEY COULD EASILY HAD SACKED the sad SACK vocals and done this as instrumentals,CAUSE THE LYRICS ARE PLAIN pointless and awfull and distract from their near brilliant stomp ,MEANDERING NOODLES INTO THE NEAR PERFECT VACuUM of PONDER SPIRAL down ventures INTO your guess as good as mind.TRAP"
2,Tool - heavy metal,"Aenima by Tool is a heavy metal cd. The lyrics are about lots of things in life. Things that are not necessarily mainstream - however the sale of this cd has reached mainstream numbers. So in that sense it is a very mainstream cd even though I find the lyrics to have a very underground quality about them. Song number 7 on this cd is called ""Hooker with a penis"" for example. The graphics on the cd cover symbols both light and dark. I guess the only way to label this cd would be call it an experience."
4,An incredible hardcore rock CD,"Tool has made some incredible music on this cd with intricate riffs, fantastic drumming, and an errie but loud lyrics and singing."
5,"hardcore ,aenima grips you by the balls.","TOOL is one of the few bands that havent gone commercial unlike korn,limp bizkit.etc,etc.this is an album thats hardcore gripping you by the balls.they define heavy heavymetal...there are many vocalists that try to scream...maynard screams with pure emotion which can be felt throughout this album.....pure emotion and anger thats heard in this album.i bought aenima in 96 and i still listen to it almost everyday without boredom ....its like listening to it for the very first time....he blends his vocals from whispers to screaming with pure emotion....im sure all tool fans can identify the intensity that i feel when i hear tool."
