4,Great movie as always. Though sad transition period.,"I love both the movie and the 10th anniversary special. I think the animation is very well done, the story is terrific, and the characters are just so memorable. For any fan of the show whether from the past to the present I'm sure that they'll enjoy both the movie, and the 10th anniversary episode. I give this review a 4 star rating only to state that for the special anniversary episode I wish that the original voices were present on the re-recorded version just to say farewell as this would've been their last special episode before leaving the show."
5,My son loves it.,"My son loved this movie. It's a little bit better than the typical Pokemon movie. Lucario is a dark, pensive, character that helps Ash and the gang. He has the power of ""aura."" Mew is a gentle friendly little Pokemon who everyone wants to possess. If you child is a Pokemon fan, I would recommend this movie. In my opinion, it's better than the Pokemon episodes in that it's not all about ""battles"" - but has a deeper theme."
5,Kids loved it!,"I bought this DVD 2disc package and it came in GREAT condition (like it said). It almost looked brand new! Anywho, I bought this for my friends kids because they are non stop talk about this movie. They rent this movie literally ever saturday and I said instead of renting it I'll buy it. They loved the extra disc along side the Pokemon movie.Thanks!"
5,Another amazing album,"This I would also highly recommend for massage/reiki. I plan to meditate earlier listening to this, as I feel it will enhance my overall self-healing session. I would easily put this among my top 5 CD's for a healing reiki session."
5,"Wonderful, Other Worldly, Etheric Music","Hello!!! :)I really enjoy listening to this while I do Reiki healings, reading New Age, and other spiritual books. I absolutly enjoy its wonderful, other worldly, etheric music! I also would recomend it for helping one to go to sleep!Peace and Blessings!!!"
5,Great Tool,"I received this as a Mother's Day gift and I love it. I walk an outdoor and indoor eleven circuit labyrinth and I also have a wooden lap labyrinth. I love them all, but I found this to be a new experience. The texture of the sand and the sound it makes as you trace the path add a new dimension to the labyrinth experience. I found I kept tracing and tracing and tracing."
5,Multi-sensory Approach to Small Space Labyrinths,"I purchased this for my office. The labyrinth itself is inviting and has a decorative quality when not in use.I find that this has a visual and tactile quality that makes it a lovely alternative to the larger (impractical in most settings)labyrinths. While one can bring it to a retreat setting for individuals to use, the sand makes it not as portable as some that seem to be designed to pop into a purse or briefcase.This is a lovely addition to an office, home, or any area that you would like to make a sacred space. Whether you are new to the spirituality of labyrinth meditation or have experienced the potential for intense moments with God through labyrinth ""walking"", the book and the labyrinth can enhance your spiritual journey."
2,Way too short,"I love TMNT, I really do. I loved `em ever since I was a kid, and when the DVDs came out, I was very disappointed to see that there was no bonus material included. So when I found out about this VHS, I bought it right away.But, don't be fooled. The tape only lasts for 25 minutes, where 15 of those are just a guy talking about TMNT 1 and 2, while you see clips from the first two movies. Pretty much like a regular movie trailer. So that leaves 10 little minutes for behind the scenes footage and interviews. If you are a big fan like me, you'll enjoy those 10 minutes, but even a die-hard fan, has to admit that 10 minutes is way to short. You get to see how the actors and puppeteers work together, which is really exciting, but that's about it.It's worth the time, but not the money. So just wait for the new TMNT movie to come out, because they'll probably re-release the old movies then, hopefully with the Behind the Shells documentary included."
4,It was everything I expected,"I was very supprised when the watch came, the packaging was very fancy, very nice. The watch is amazing its everything I expected. Its a little heavy but not to heavy. The movement is fun to watch and it is an all around great watch, I highley recomend it to anyone looking for a automatic nice watch."
4,Nice watch,"This has an accurate automatic movement though not much of a power reserve. That is my only complaint. Otherwise, it's beautiful and not too heavy. Highly recommended."
3,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed when this product arrived. There was very little identifying it as the Florida Gator stadium. There's a sticker (and not a very good one) that is supposed to be the field and a gold colored name plate on the front (it's not even on straight), other than that there's nothing marking it. There were 3 little flags on one end that weren't attached very good. One fell off when we took it out of the box to put in the display case."
2,"Ok, but not great...","I was interested in a basic outdoor survival book and someone recommend the Ranger Handbook. The book itself is small which would make it easy to carry in a pack, but sometimes makes it difficult to read and see the diagrams. The book does include some good material, but actually includes a lot of military related information that is really not applicable to most folks. Now, having said that it is a US Army Ranger Handbook, so one would expect to find Army related information, so this makes me wonder if this is the best choice for a basic outdoor survival guide. I also felt the quality of the book was a little questionable and wonder if it would hold up very well to repeated outdoor use. At the end of the day I found the book interesting, but not really what I was looking for."
2,Very Small for $20.,"I bought this because it is supposed to be the newest version. I paid 19.99 for it, and thought my husband would get a kick out of it, since he's always going on about how ""cool"" the rangers are. Frankly, it was a little disapointing. Not what I expect out of a 20 dollar book. It has some charts in it, and I would say its about 5inches by 3inches. IF this book was under $10 I would have given it a higher rating, because thats what it looks like it's worth."
1,not happy,Picture is not what you're getting. KMS has a new formula which has a different packaging and an unbearable smell. I had to send it back. I thought I was getting the old formula because that is what is pictured.
5,Slim in 6 Cardio Core!,"I have done other Slim in 6 workouts, and they truly work. It may not look like you are doing much of anything, but those muscles begin working and you do indeed burn lots of calories. The commercial is right, you will burn nearly 1000 calories per workout! I was shocked when I saw my heart rate monitor, I had burned 945 calories in one workout! So I know for a fact that these Slim in 6 videos work. Anyways, if you are looking to slim down, tone your muscles, lift your booty, and get a great cardio workout with a mild down to earth instructor then Slim in 6 is for you. The Cardio Core made me sore the next day, and I definitely felt the burn with this dvd. Highly recommended."
5,Cardio Core,If you stick with this video it does make a difference in how you feel about yourself. More positive feelings the more you workout to this video.
5,Rock,"If you need good rock n' roll, buy this CD! It's so good, it makes me wanna punch the person standing right next to me!"
4,Good Start,"If you like ""Fever to Tell"" then this is a good album. It has that same raw sound as well as a softer, gentler song. ""Bang"" is great and ""Year to be Hated"" is good as well."
2,Over Over Overhyped!,"This EP (which doesn't even include their best live song--Tick)sounds like the soundtrak to an early '60s biker B-movie, which is not a bad thing really. However the YYYs are NOT the saviours of rock, they are NOT new, innovative, or especially talented either. They do have a hot female singer that likes to scream, and for some people that is enough. But if you want raw sounding guitars & drums and lyrics with actual depth and meaning check out DRY or Rid of Me by PJ Harvey. She was doing this stuff 10 yrears ago, and did a much better job of it, too."
2,ahhhhhh.......,"this isnt the worst band in the world, but if your looking for the core of nyc rock n roll for today, i'd check out bands like The Plums, Bona Roba, and Moebius Loop."
4,Good indie / garage EP,"I think this EP has a lot of character. Normally I would only give something like this 3 stars because the musicianship isn't very mature or individualistic, but I give this an extra star for personality and interesting production value. Sounds a lot like the White Stripes, but less provincial and more worldly. I suppose that's the New Yorker element."
4,New and refreshing,"One of the most original bands I've heard in a long time. This is one of those albums I just cannot stop playing. The Yeah Yeah Yeah's have that touch of 80's punk to them that brings out some nostalgia, but they are NOT an imitation band. The bring originality by the boat load. Be the first kid on your block to be able to say ""yeah, I've been listening to them for a while."" Because I have a feeling these guys are only going to get bigger."
3,um...yeah,"I avoided the 60's garage revival like the plague but Karen and her boys I couldn't resist. This is so vibrant I don't care. It rocks, it pounds, it chirps, it winks at you--it'll make you f'n' dance."
2,Not as talented as the Strokes,"I love The White Stripes, and The Strokes. My friend told me to check this out. I did and I wasn't impressed. The funny part is I keep hearing good things about them ????????? Apparently they put on a high energy show. Maybe their upcoming full album will be better."
4,"I would have given it 5 stars, but....",...It was too short!! I really enjoyed this despite of it's miniscule playlist. While listening I got lingering images of The Pretenders rolling around in my head. Hopefully the YYY's will consider recording a c.d. of decent lenth next time. Then I'll give them that extra star.
2,Don't believe the hype,"Karen O has a great vocal style, but the songs are HORRIBLE. Go listen to Siouxsie And The Banshees instead."
3,Don't Get Carried Away Yet Guys!,"Another NY garage/punk/rock band hitting the hype-super highway, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs debut offering is a very good start to as yet an unknown future. I only say that because of the fact that similar bands these days seem to 1)come from nowhere 2)get RAVE reviews 3)participate in your life's sountrack for a few weeks and then 4)fade away for a bit. I feel I must remind some reviewers out there that a 5star rating is PERFECTION! There are not too many bands in the HISTORY of rock and roll that have begun their careers with the perfect record are there!? This is close but lets not get too carried away just yet. My fav. song on the album is Miles Away, incidently as songs go its a 5star one! For Karen O's attention: I would like you to come over to Ireland so I can at LEAST buy you a pint:)"
4,"Less of a toy, more of a prop - great for costumes!","Definitely a costume accessory, but still fun for kids to tote around in make believe. It is a soft plastic (think the ""fake"" barbies of the 80s), so a toddler running around this could do damage to knick-nacks, but won't do too much damage to their family members! Works great as a prop."
3,Pretty good watch for the price,"I would advise not taking any links out of the band - gives it a strange shape that only sits well on the very bottom of your wrist - and with all links in, it may be a little big. Otherwise nice watch, have always been happy with Seiko quality."
3,Good warnings but . . .,"OK the descriptions of the various ways that your doctor, HMO, or hospital can harm you are very well presented. However, potential readers should know that he rants and raves throughout the book continually implying that the health-care industry is only a group of greedy, uncaring people. The book takes a purely political swing in the last chapter where jumps into a promotion of very liberal universal health care coverage (a very different subject) as if this will solve all of our problems - "". . . all people in this country would share one level of medical care. No one would get an inferior level of care because he had no money . . ."" Give me a break! None of the universal care countries have achieved this utopia. Karl Marx was wrong - equality does not create happiness. Productivity creates happiness."
1,Don't buy it.,"In the many years that my wife and I have been using this wonderful shopping site, we have never felt compelled to write a negative review - until we purchased this gorilla. When I buy a stuffed animal for my daughter, my only expectations are that it is soft and that the fur stay in tact. It is not soft, and the fur continues to fall out. I admit, it is my own fault for buying a stuffed animal online without checking it out in person, but I have had so many pleasant shopping experiences through Amazon that I thought it would be OK. Maybe mine is defective, I don't know. The raggedy gorilla sitting next to me is very poorly made."
5,Beautiful Gorilla,"Hello, I am a lover of gorillas, and do collect them. After this gorilla arrived, I fell instantly in love. His coloring and fur are excellent, especially the silver-back.He is big enough to hug and squeeze, yet small enough for easy display. (I'd never hide him or put him away. I gave a perfect score, because I'm perfectly happy with this little gorilla."
3,Don't be fooled,"Nice toy, But not the size you would think. Our dogs love their giant monkeys and bears. When looking locally the 20"" sized toys are measured by body size not by arms stretched out. That is the only way to get to 20 inches with this gorilla. Again, Nice toy just small. More like 15"" head to toe."
3,Can't Do The Book Justice In A Movie Format,"The quality of the movie itself was great, but this story just doesn't fit into a movie time frame. (The Royal Shakespeare Company stage version produced by A&E is 9 hours long - and they skip some parts to move the story along.) Listening to the audio book version while walking or driving is the way to go to experience the whole story if you don't have the time to read the book. The movie did a great job of representing the characters, but they are just snapshots compared to the book."
1,Read the description carefully,"I bought a ""new"" one from MovieMars for under $10. Turns out it is a region 2 & 3 DVD. Not region 1 for us/canada. They should put (Region 2&3) in the title, not in the smaller print half a page down. My mistake tho. So it's on the way back at my expense."
5,Excellent MOvie,"This movie is well written, well directed and well acted...I can't wait for this movie to be on DVD...and for the Jane Austen fun, see it. I know you will just LOVE it. Just like I did....Trust me this is an excellent movie. Don't let this one pass you by."
3,Good but not great,"Great effort by the handsome first timer, Charlie Hunnam, in the title role. Jamie Bell is outstanding in his role as he is in all his portrayals. Very entertaining"
5,my review,All I can say is that I LOVED IT!!!! It was one of the best Dickens movies ever. The charachters were just write. The coloring was vivid. The stroy is really heart warming and dear. This is an excellent movie to buy!
3,Disapointing...........................................,"I found this new version of Charles Dicken's wonderful book Nicholas Nickleby to be disapointing. Charlie Hunnam's Nicholas seemed shallow, insipid and abrupt. Jamie Bell's performance as poor Smike was one of the only high points. Also we never see some of the most interesting characters, Madame Mantalini and her husband for instance, and are barely intorduced to little Miss La Creevy. If you are simply in the mood some light and abriviated Dickens then this is the movie for you. However, if you really want to see this classic brought to life, then I highly reccomend Acorn Media's beautiful 2000 version, featuring James D'Arcy who made a far more kind, deep and human Nicholas, and Lee Ingleby, who is brilliant as Smike. Also staring Charles Dance as Ralph Niclkeby. The Royal Shakespeare Company's ""The Life And Adventures Of Nicholas Nickleby"", is wonderful as well."
2,DO NOT BUY U.S.A.,This movie made only for DVD players in Europe ONLY. IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE SOLD IN THE U.S.A. I do not recommend buying this product if you live in America
4,So sorry!!,The story was well done but for the many parts that were left out - also having a man play Mrs. Crummles took much away from the reality attempted.
5,Kid Movie Critic,"A heart warming film that is fun for the whole family. From the moment you start watching it, it makes you want to know more. Some tears may shed for Smike and there will be lots of laughing. Though Anne Hathaway could have played Nicholas's love intrest better, the movie overall deserves 5 stars."
4,Outstanding Movie,"Another great preformance my Jamie Bell, good movie for ALL AGES. Have watched it several times now. This is the very first used movie I have bought, nothing wrong with it. Arrived as stated, shipped same day as ordered, GOOD SERVICE. Would buy from this seller again."
4,"Tea: Loved, loved, loved it!","Overall, having never read the book, or heard anything about the story, I had NO idea what to expect. But was presently surprised by a great story, that had me laughing, talking back to the screen, and cheering in my seat while I watched it.The story starts out quite dark, it was almost too depressing to keep watching. It follows a young man at the death of his father, where he becomes the head of the house and responsible for his mother and younger sister. They make their way to London to enlist the help of his uncle, and father's brother.Lots of drama in this movie, wide variety of interesting characters, great dialogue pacing, and it ended with a really feel good ending. And some excellent twists in this movie that really keep you guessing what's going to happen. Excellent casting as well.It should have been up for ""Oscars"".I would not only buy this, but would watch it regularly!"
4,Splendid movie,"Besides all the eye candy involving attractive actors and breathtaking landscape, this movie is well acted with highly lovable and easily despised characters. Every actor really outdid themselves. In the final scene during the wedding toast, there is a quote I would like to see widely distributed. I love movies that take you through a wide range of emotions and that draw you into the character's experiences. This movie exceeded all my expectations."
5,Premature Pleasures is right on time.,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Although written for a teen audience, there's something in it for everyone. The mother/daughter relationship made me re-visit the past and some of the decisions I made while raising two small children alone. This book really makes you think about the tough, hard issues that most adults find it difficult to face. Hats off to the author!! Keep up the good work!"
3,Fact filled chronology of eagles history together and solo.,"Told largely from the perspective of former bassist Randy Meisner, and supported by interviews by the band and their families and friends over their career, the Long Run takes the fan on a journey through Eagles history. It begins with individual bios, follows them from the formation of the band, through the revolving door of band members and culminates in a short segment on the reunion. Also included is information on each members work as a solo artist.The book is full of excellent insight into the inner workings of the band. The ego battles and squabbles within the group, targeting Frey and particularly Henley, who are pictured as unsympathetic egocentric control freaks are detailed, as well as the drug abuse that ran rampant during this time.All in all a quick and easy read, with 20 pages of photo's."
3,Messy People Aply Within,"I used to be really messy...still am, with my room that it. I am going into high school this year and I`m ready for 7 teachers instead of 2 because I organised my work with the Student Organiser. I rate this product with three stars."
1,This unit is garbage - don't waste your money away!,"I bought this DVD player to use in my classroom (I'm a teacher). It worked great the first 2 times. I thought I got a great deal.....until I tried to use it a third time. I get sound, but absolutely no picture. I've tried various cables, etc. The problem is the DVD player. Let me tell you, I was NOT pleased when I had 45 2nd graders staring at me with anticipation when it was time to watch Finding Nemo and this piece of garbage stopped working. One of the kids actually said to me, ""Man, you got ripped off!"" Did I ever! The worst part is that I have contacted CyberHome FOUR times to get this unit serviced and have gotten no response. I think they're waiting for the warranty to expire. I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. If you've had this problem with the company, I urge you to do the same. If you make a shoddy product, you should be prepared to pay the consequences (make repairs and give refunds)."
1,zone free NOT,"I bought this mechine to watch DVD's from other zones than #1. as it appeared to be presented in their advertisement. It will not. When I tried calling the company from the # in the manuel, I was directed to 10 15 15 8000 a 'new' directory assistance' company charging $5.49 for information. There now is no listing for 'CyberHome' in Fremont, CA. The player is OK but it won't play other zone DVDs. Don't believe the add."
1,REBATE FRAUD,"NO REBATE FROM THESE CROOKS. They owe me $20.They send postcard declining rebate. They have my UPC cut from carton and my unit serial number. Rebate sent on time, arrived on time and purchased item during rebate time period.Unit performs badly. Last Cyberhome product I buy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP,"Out of the box, this player could not read 3 different DVDs from the rental store. My Toshiba DVD player played the same 3 DVDs with no problem. This player was out of the box for about 30 minutes; I boxed it back up, and returned it promptly.There should really be a ""0 stars"" rating available. Junk like this deserves no stars."
1,Would not recommend!,"I don't normally review products, but, as I was scanning for a replacement for this POS, I found it for sale here at Amazon and thought that I may save someone else the headache. After being used for a total of about 12 hours, this player stopped working completely. It decided to hold my DVD hostage, refusing to either play it or open the disc tray. After trying every resource I could think of, I finally extracted my DVD with a screwdriver. Luckily, I got the disc out clean, since it's worth more than this junk player. Spend the extra money for a brand with actual customer service."
1,Don't waste your money,OK so it's only $40 but you'd at least expect it to work. This machine is so noisy. It sounds like it's scraping the disk as it spins. Even when in a TV cabinet you can still hear it grinding away. If you're lucky it may even play the odd DVD. We bought it to play our Pal DVDs but only a few of them work. It skips & jumps but mostly stops playing a few minutes in. Please do not buy this product!
2,An okay unit while it worked... Died within a year.,"Just another cheap DVD player. Built with poor quality components, which have a very limited lifespan. Mine died a slow, agonizing death. It looks like one of the capacitors has failed.It does PAL/NTSC, and it's easy to make region free. It does not play anamorphic PAL correctly. The picture quality is average at best. The PAL->NTSC conversion is poor by todays standards with visible frame drops, and 'juttering' in fast camera movements. It does provide a DTS output, which is nice.I wouldn't buy another one. Really, one is paying $40 for about a years worth of usability. Then, like me, you will probably throw it into a landfill, and wonder if we're doing anything other than damaging the environment and helping China's economy to grow."
2,"Thought it was good, until I learned better.","I bought this DVD player about 2 years ago when I bought a british dvd and wanted to play it on more than just my computer.I thought it was an amazing investment for the longest time. It played anything I put in it, including home made VCDs.Then I realized that it actually skips scenes, but almost seamlessly. I wonder how many movies I didn't get to enjoy all of because this junky DVD player skipped scenese of the movie. I only figured it out this year when I was watching a movie I owned on someone else's player and saw a scene I had never seen before. I'd watched the DVD over and over but NEVER caught this part.I don't know why it does it or on which DVDs, but I don't want to risk missing parts of any more movies."
1,everything about it is great except...,"it doesn't work! it's a great small design and has all the features and well thought out menus. i popped a pal dvd-r in and it auto converted to ntsc beautifully for about 5 mins. then it froze. didn't play anything after that. i suspect the problem is heat related. it was very warm to the touch. all the ntsc disks that the cyberhome rejected played flawlessly on my sony dvd. back in the box it went and with amazon's fantastic return policy, i paid nada for the trial. if the cyberhome guys read this, my suggestion is to put some better heat syncs on it and do some qc at the factory. raise the price $20. but, don't sell a product that doesn't work!"
1,"Good price, terrible at playing DVDs.","As a lot of the other reviews indicate, the price is right. Unfortunately, the product fails to play DVDs. Ours played everything we put in it for the first three months, and now it has up and died on us. Sometimes it won't recognize discs, sometimes it will, sometimes it skips, sometimes it freezes. Sometimes it'll play a DVD that it refused to play five minutes earlier. It's a terrible machine -- it's worth it to invest a little more money in something that won't give you so much frustration."
1,"Good company, Bad model","I have used a cyberhome player for more than 18 months until my old player got damaged while I was moving to another location. As mentioned in the other reviews, Cyberhome is a very good player and it gives good value for your money.However, this particular series (300S) has a problem. I got a player from Best buy and had to take it back as it used to ""stall"" on even very slightly scratched DVDs.I then got the same brand from Circuit City - Same problem. The common thing about both the players was the Series - 300S.Thankfully I did not have to pay anything as I had got the player from a store and returns were easy.Think twice before getting this particular model (300S) of Cyberhome."
2,Mine lasted 9 months,"I also thought I had gotten lucky and got a good unitUntil the laser failed at 9 months. Of course, with 90 days labor only under warranty, they want at least $40 for repair.Avoid this unit"
1,3 out of 3 what a luck!,I bought three units on sale for myself and family. Beleive it or not all three stopped working all in the first year. To be honest one of them is still working but with the sound come and go and only through the SVedeo because the other vedeo outs have no signals. The good news is I got 3 remotes for a semi working unit. No one should ever buy these units and no store should sell them either. I am glad AMAZON is making these reviews easly available for buyers.
1,don't buy CyberHome products that only last for few months,Bought one Last November. It failed to read any DVD by March. Only run 2~3 DVD per week.
2,Sounds keeps turning off,"Low price and very compact foot print are the positives. The negative I found is that the sound will intermittantly stop playing. This can be corrected by ungplugging and replugging the unit. However, I have it in a kitchen cabinent connected to a wall mounted TV and ungplugging it is a pain. Remote is IR not RF so not so sensitive. I am planning on looking for another small footprint DVD player."
1,Not worh it,"It plays cd's fine. Its the dvd's it has major problems with. It played for maybe a week. Then it started pausing, freezing then it altogether stopped. I emailed cyberhome for assistance and they never got back to me. Figures. Don't purchase it. Its not worth the money."
1,Don't Throw Your Money Away,"My Cyberhome DVD player locked up and will not play any more. I had used it maybe 10 times!I went online and found others expressing that they had the same experience.I wish I had gone with another brand.I emailed Cyberhome with my complaint hoping they could give me some kind of advice on how to get it working again but, they never returned my email with any comment.I would not recommend any product sold by Cyberhome. It doesn't seem to me as though they care about repeat business with their customers. Just sell it cheap and rip them off one at a time.Thanks, Mark"
1,Quality control,"Obviously, judging by the other reviews, the quality control on this product leaves a lot to be desired. It seems to either work very well or very poorly. Mine is one of the latter. Have only used it a few hours but it will not track a DVD beyond about an hour. In other words, the outer portion of the disc. Tried using a Memorex laser cleaning disc, but this did not help. Mine is a piece of junk, as far as I am concerned. Don't waste your money on this lottery."
1,Waste of Money,"I agree with the other negative reviewers. We bought this in Dec 2002 and it broke down in Dec 2003 with very limited usage. Just would not read any DVDs. Just stopped!!. We just used it for regular DVDs and not for anything else. Sure waste of money.It maybe worth if purchased with a 3 or 4 year replacement plan (best buy or circuitcity), in that case it looses its money value, but at least you can replace the faulty one. Anyone who bought this in the last 10-15 days, can buy this plan to avoid headaches."
2,Below Adverage,"I got this DVD Player for Christmas and like the small size and light weight. It is extra easy to move betweeen TV's. However, it freezes up and won't work very often and skips on DVD's that otherwise work perfect on my other players. Don't buy unless it is the cheapest one you can get and you do not mind a 40% Reliability rate."
2,Good for 3 to 6 months,"Bought this 6 months ago. Not very reliable performer. If you want to play VCDs and other region DVDs, then this player will work for you. If you are looking for high quality picture look somewhere else.The DVD/CD tray stopped working for me after 3 months. It opens and closes so fast you will not have time to remove the DVD or load a new DVD. It also gives ""Tray Error"". I have used it for 3 months and thrown it in junk. Will have to buy a quality DVD player for long term use."
1,beware of rebate scam!,"On the rebate form they provide a place to cut out the UPC code and a place to write the serial number. Then they reject the rebate claiming that you're supposed to cut the serial number from the box too. Probably, the clearest/most obvious rebate scam I've ever fallen victim to. DVD player still works mostly, but I would never trust this company to buy anything else."
3,great but....,"although the unit is region-free and can play whatever format the company advertised..., it only lasted for a year. so... don't let the price tempted you."
2,You get what you pay for.,i have own this dvd player for less then 6 months. i rarely use it since i have no time to watch dvds anymore. i went to go and watch a movie for my english paper and the darn thing wouldnt work at all. snowflakes all over my screen. at first i thought it was a connection problem but no. it simply doesnt work. this is not the perfect college dvd player because in college you want to save money. i feel like i waisted my $40.00 on this piece. i am very disappointed. i bought it for its size since i do not have much space in my room. i should never have bought anything with cyber and home in the same name! what a cheesy rip-off. do not waist your money!learn from my mistake!
4,Good for the money!!,Hi..I have been using this player for almost a year now... works good and serves the purpose. I bought another one for my cousin and he is happy too.
4,Its more than worth its prize,"It really serves it purpose decently. Sleek, very portable.Cyberhome rebate process is awesome. I got the rebate after 4 weeks :-)"
4,Awesome product for people interested in watching international movies,"I watch a lot of international movies and the main problem I used to face with my old DVD player is the compatibility issue. Since this DVD player can play both NTSC/PAL, it is great product for people like me. So far no complaints but I heard that the product life is about 1.5 to 2 years. I can't complain for that as I paid only $20 for it."
4,Great item.,"I bought this to watch some British car racing dvds that are not available in the US format. It was so very inexpensive that I was skeptical. I've been using it for 2 weeks now, and it works perfectly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't have any type of lcd display on the unit."
5,Exceptional value for money,"For the money, unbeatable: delivers a decent picture, reads multiple regions, occupies almost no space. A very tidy product.Usage is moderate, and so far it has been reliable."
4,A pretty good bargain,"I got my CyberHome DVD player two to three years ago because of the very inexpensive price and the compact size, to use as a second player for the bedroom. I think it is in the process of dying now, but until this has worked very well for what I need, which has been simply a little player which fits neatly on top of the TV so that I can watch DVD's in bed. For the money, I would call this a good buy, and I will consider buying another one."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The player worked great for the first 14 month, after which it just stopped playing DVDs, dispaying the ""Bad disk"" error. [...]"
2,Size does matter,"Like most of you, I purchased this DVD player for 2 reasons. It was cheap, and it was one of the few DVD players that were small enough to fit next to my TV on my chest of drawers. Great deal, right?Well, I've had this thing for about 5 months and I can tell you, it won't last. Often times the DVD that's playing will just freeze, forcing you to restart the DVD player. Other times it won't even read the DVD when you put it in, and just gets stuck on the ""Loading"" screen, which forces you to restart the player. I've also noticed that if I stack more than 4 DVDs with cases on top of the DVD player, it also effects the playing. It just seems to be a very fragile cheaply made item.If it's worth it to you to fork out $35-$50 on a DVD player that will last you about 6 months, then this product is for you."
1,"Works Great, until it dies when the warrenty's up","We got this for christmas in 2003, and it worked great. The picture was fine and there was no noise. We didn't use it too much, a max of one or two movies a week, if even that. It never gave us any problems until June of 2004 when it stopped working. It wouldn't read any discs and it would go from being color to black and white on the loading screen anytime we opened or closed the CD compartment. We opened it up with a screw driver and found a section of it appeared to have been burnt. Our guess is that it over heated and got fried. Other customers appear to have the same problem so it doesn't seem to be just ours. Save your money and buy a better dvd player that will last longer."
4,"Not Region-Free, exactly...","I bought this DVD player (my very first indeed) for a number of reasons.First, it is small, and can fit nicely in my small apartment.Second, since the box claims it can read both PAL and NTSC formats, I wanted to substitute two other laptops I have (one with a Region 1 player and the second with a Region 2 player) so that I could see whatever DVD in one single machine.But just as another reviewer pointed out, this is not a multiregion DVD! It just doesn't play Region 2 DVDs, which I find frustrating.However, since I buy nearly all my DVDs from Amazon.com (which offers Region 1 products) the vast majority of my collection plays in this little machine.Besides, (...) offered, so I got to save some money after all.."
1,A Total Junk,"I got it last Nov from Radioshack. After six months, it stopped working and can not play any disc. Since the warranty(3 months) expired, I had to throw it away. their warranty policy and product quanlity is a perfect match."
2,"nice dvd player, but WITH FLAWS!","I picked up this dvd player from sears in march 2004 for about 39.00. upon using it, discovered that remote is cramped and hard to use, and the player is NOISY! also, small watch battery is used for remote battery. no display screen to show you anything just a yellow led that flashes.however it does play everything i want it too, dvd's dvd's that ive burned, mp3's music, pics, etc.just a poorly constructed dvd player.you get what you pay for!!"
1,Do not buy this dvd player,I bought this dvd player thinking it was a good price. It stopped working within 2 months.
1,A piece of junk!,"I got this unit for Christmas and did not use it until a few weeks ago. The first dvd played was fine. Then had problems with a second dvd (skipped frames throughout), so I thought it was corrupted and Amazon graciously sent a replacement. Recently I tried to play another dvd (which I have played several times on another unit) and the same thing happened. The light bulb went on! Don't waste your time. This unit may be cheap but not worth the aggravation."
3,Value for money and versatile.,"We just bought a CH-DVD320 from Target which is identical to CH-DVD300. Its a nice little player which can play DVD, VCD, Home VCDs burnt with Nero etc. I also modified the 'Region Setting' on the player which will allow me to play all region DVDs. The modifications can be found in the review written by John Bryce. Thanks John. The player can also be played in countries where the voltage is 220V instead of 110V. Thats perfect because I can take it with me when I travel. Go ahead and buy this player."
1,Ginormous Waste of Money,"I have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 1/2 years, every one of them has had the same problems. Trouble reading dvds, dvds skipping, discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units. The price is right on the unit, but not for the time it worked. I would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem. If I could give it less than 1 star I would because thats really what it is worth, nothing."
3,I Really Don't Know What to Tell You,"I bought this DVD player and sometimes it wanted to recognize the disk, and sometimes it didn't. My friend has the exact same unit, and never had a problem with hers. I returned my tempermental machine for another one (same model and all) and it works fine.The mixed reviews on this item seem to be reflective of my own little personal experience."
1,Cool...if it worked!,"After reading the reviews for this machine, I decided to risk getting a lemon given the cheap price and good feature set. However, after 1 day of use, it stopped working. The S video connection and component video connection both stopped working. All I can say is you get what you pay for. It's on its way to the return bin now.My advice: skip this unless you want to waste your time with returns."
2,Does not play mpeg,"Although it lists mpeg on the box and in some descriptions I have seen online(outpost), there is no mention of it in the manual or on the unit.It is a pretty good unit although the remote is very small with an annoying button layout. The remote also uses button batteries! When it came out it was a good deal, but now there are so many players on the market you can get a better brand for the same price."
1,This unit is piece of garbage,60 days it worked good and now when I turn on DVD I have on my screen white dots. DVD plays good but I still have a several lines of white dots. They are arrangment by diagonal several rows. Sometimes these lines dissapear for a short time. After cleaning lenses I have the same problem. [...]
5,The best DVD player I've ever owned!!,One day I was shopping at Walmart and noticed a rather inexpensive DVD player by a company I had never heard of..It was kind of small and the price was right and my RCA DVD player was on its last legs so I said what the heck and boy..was I pleasantly surprised! This little gem of a player does everything! For a little over $30 I rate this player as one of the best bargains out there! The picture quality is really good and I have never had a DVD freeze up on me like I used to with my RCA player. I think I am going to pick up another one for our second TV..for $30 you can't beat it!
4,Value for money,"Already had it for 1 yr, bought this one for my parents. It works decent, won't say its great. Sometimes get stuck, but overall pretty good Value for Money."
4,Cheapest hackable player on the market!,"The thing that was the selling point to me was that this player is very easy to hack into using the remote to make region free. Yes, the player is noisy and generates some heat, but not so much as a PS2. If you search hard enough on google, you'll find how to make yours region free also. This player also plays highly scratched disks quite well. In a most extreme case I took a disc that I rubbed against dry wall and wrote on with a black sharpie. It still played in my Cyberhome! This was not the case with my Samsung."
2,Couldn't read DVD-R,"My unit worked with commerically pressed DVDs, but could not read DVD-R's. Too bad, back it goes."
2,Remember it's cheap,"This player was small, something I was looking for, cheap, and got ""some"" good reviews. It worked OK, although would skip some things when in FF mode and occasionally lock up on something. That was until it just stopped working, now every disk, of any description, that I put in it is a ""bad disk"". They all play fine everywhere else. Remember it's cheap."
2,Cheaper at Wal-Mart,"I bought this thinking it would play movies from Britain, but I missed a code or something and ended up with a basic DVD player, so I eventually returned it. It was okay as a regular DVD player, but the same thing is at Wal-Mart for less money."
3,Great Picture - Mine Still Works Perfect after 3 Months So Far,"Very nice for the price. And it was the perfect size for what I needed. Excellent picture. However, although sound quality is excellent also, it does not get loud enough. My only other complaint is that the power light NEVER goes off. When the unit is turned off the green power light turns red but stays on. Because of the red light, and the sound volume I have to take away 2 stars, but I still highly recommend this for the price, and if you need a very small unit."
3,Old version better than the new one.,"I had one CyberHome CH-DVD 300S Progressive-Scan DVD Player that I bought around 5 years ago and it was great, the dvd player I ever had. It could play everything including Divx format. I gave it to my Mom in Brazil and decided to buy another one, the same model, but they are coming different now. They look the same, they have the same name 300S but they are not playing Divx format. This is usually the format you have for dvds created in your PC. So, all taht big advantage it had before is gone. The only good thing remaining is that it still is a multi-region dvd player."
4,This little gem has one feature no other DVD player apparently has.,"First, this player produces a crystal clear picture equal to the pricier model I own of another very well-known brand, and the response time of this player to any button pressed on its remote is also twice as fast as my pricier model.And now for the number one reason I bought this player: its remote has a ""1/All"" button that will continuously play and repeat all episodes on a standard DVD -- a small thing, but extremely useful, especially if the DVD itself has no ""Play All"" option on its root menu. Apparently, this is particular to this brand of DVD player; I've tried two other brands of DVD players and neither of them featured this ability. ""Associates"" at BestBuy and Circuit City also informed me they sell no DVD players at any price that have this feature. By the way, the first one I'd bought of these died within a year after purchase, but at this price, replacing it is not a mighty concern."
1,Shortlived DVD player,"I bought this DVD in November and used it for about 4 months. In March, it started giving problems. It freezes while trying to play any DVD or VCD while the same DVD/VCD works fine in another player. I plan to throw this player and DON'T RECOMMEND this to anyone who wants to buy it. You will only get about 3-4 months to get you out of the warranty period. Warranty is valid for 3 months labor and upto 1 year with a $[...]service fee (I bought this for $[...])!!"
1,Not a 'DVD player' at all,"This DVD player doesn't play half the DVDs you put in it. It freezes up, displays ugly digital pixellation of image, and then refuses to play DVD altogether. I bought it because of the multi-region capabilities. It does a horrible job of converting PAL to NTSC. My 5-year-old no-name DVD player does a better job. This should not even be listed as a 'DVD player.' I am in the process of trying to get a refund after 2 of these units failed to perform their duties.ZERO stars"
1,What? I can't hear?,"If you love to ""watch"" movies, this DVD player is for you. However, if you also like to ""hear"" them at the same time, I would spend my $$$ somewhere else. My Cyberhome DVD player's audio went out after 2 months!!! I guess I got what I paid for. I recommend placing your money on a decent name brand instead of this DVD player."
3,Resume Function,"Just be aware of the following:a) If you stop a DVD mid-way hoping to return hours or days later, you will not be able to. The player turns off automatically after some time without keeping ""your place"" for you.b) The remote control has many functions however the buttons are very small, almost tiny with very little space between them."
1,Don't waste your time and money in this item,"This item is the worst dvd player I had ever bough. Skips, and stops too much. Is a pain in the neck trying to watch a movie. Well you get what you pay for!"
3,Will continue to work if you remember to upnplug it.,"I think I know what the problem is with this DVD player. I purchased this model a few years ago and it eventually stopped working (wouldn't turn on even with a fresh battery in the remote). I think this happened because I left it plugged in all the time with the power off. I think the fact that it is ""plugged in"" burns out the components even thought the power is supposedly ""off"". I purchased the same model again about two years ago and I always unplug it when I'm not using it and it works perfectly. I think this is a good DVD player for the price--you just have to remember to unplug it when it's not in use."
3,Not for the home theater enthusiast.,"I wanted to be able to play home made DVD-R's on Television. It does play any DVD disc format on the planet. I found that it also plays MPEGS and AVI files on CD just fine.Just don't make this your primary home theater player. I couldn't get it to output 5.1 surround sound to save my life. It has a coaxial port (which is what my old DVD player was using), but it won't output surround sound audio to my receiver. Even though I set the settings on the player to what was designated in the manual. Since other reviewers mentioned theirs not working right out of the box, I guess I am fortunate.The remote control layout is also awkward, and it takes some getting used to. I use it now strictly for QA videos I make for work. It works just fine in that capacity. I am not unhappy for the price."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It lasted only 8 months! Of course, it didn't break while it was under the full warranty. Now I would have to pay for shipping and labor. Definitely not worth it if I'll only get another 8 months out of it. It would have been cheaper to have spent the extra money originally. Now it will cost me even more."
2,It was nice while it lasted,"I purchased this at a good price, after about a year of ownership it stopped working. Apparently there is a cable that shorts out after a while and the thing just freezes up after playing 10 minutes of your dvd."
3,Doesn't play all DVDs or CDs,I've had my player for about a year now and recently it's been skipping a lot. Also CDs that used to play well in don't play at all. I can hear it spinning the disc in a futile attempt at finding a track to play. I'm a bit disappointed but hey it was only $35.
2,total bummer.,"I don't care if it costs $39 or $105 or whatever, a dvd player shouldn't stop working after 13 months, which is how long I've had this thing. It worked just fine, and then one day it refused to load my dvds anymore. So now the company wants ME to pay to ship it back and have it serviced. I don't THINK so! I can just get a new one; are they kidding?However, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least we had 13 months together rather than it failing right away or after only a few uses. But so much for no-name brands. I'm getting a Philips or a Panasonic for my next player."
5,Exceptional value,"I have owned this DVD player for about 4 months now and have bought one for my parents in India. Since it works with 220V and plays in PAL, it works great in India too. Here in US, I have no problems what so ever with it. I am very very satisfied with it and will highly recommend it."
1,Will not get your rebates,I bought this item from Amazon and did send all the rebates the very next day with everything enclosed. But I did get a postcard from Cyberhome stating that they did not get the rebate on time. So don't count on the rebates from Cyberhome.
4,Great little player,"I have so far gotten 5 of these babies, and exchanged one of them only. The following are the pros and cons:Pros: It plays both pal and ntsc formats of dvds, it also has region free ability. Small size makes my tiny studio apartment not too messy.Cons: If you pause the dvd/vcd for a long time (I tried at least 2 hours on purpose), then played the dvd again, the picture would be distorted, but then I just turned off the player and turned it back on, it was fixed. So it's not a big issue. Also, it doesn't have display available. It doesn't really bother me, but again, it would be nice if it had the display LCD.Final thought: I bought 5 cyberhome CH-DVD 300s, and there was only one that didn't power on when I pushed the power button on the player itself. I brought it back to BestBuy, and they told me there was no problem with it, but I exchanged it anyway. Just so you guys know, I have own the 1st player over 2 years and it never stopped working."
1,Poor and Time Degrading Performance,"I've purchased two of the Cyberhome DVD-300 players in 24 months. The first one performed acceptably for approx. 18 months, then began to produce erratic/frozen video feed which lead to purchase of second unit. The second unit's out-of-the-box performance never equaled the first unit's. Within the first month of use it was producing the same erratic/frozen video feed - even from brand new dvd's! I will never again waste money on any cyberhome product. Please be aware that the bargain you believe you are buying isn't that great when you have to replace it every 12-18 months......"
1,Absolute Junk - Do NOT Waste Your Money!,I was given this for Christmas and now after 3 months and 6 movies it's completely toast... and it died in the middle of a movie!
1,Piece of junk,"My roommate and I have this DVD player. It's less than a month old, and it's a certified piece of junk. The player often stalls or gets stuck, it's noisy (you can often hear it humming even with moderate moderate volume on the TV). Sometimes, the only way to get it to function is by unplugging it and plugging it back in (even the power button won't respond), a pain if your outlet is behind a large cabinet.Spend the extra money to get a brand name DVD player. Half the el-cheapos you see on the market are useless. Before this one, we had a JVC player that worked beautifully, until it was stolen."
1,Works for awhile,I bought this last christmas for our family. Today it died after maybe being used 25 times. I am not impressed with the short life span of the DVD player. I wish we would have spent a little more money. Now I have to buy a new one.
2,it is NOT multisystem DVD player,"it's very slick, tiny, nice looking player (bought it for $43 in local WalMart).It plays all media I tried. And all formats. Though some SVCDs showed slight A/V-asynch (on other players these disks are fine).As to the DVD - very good player. But make sure you stick to the one system (NTSC or PAL), or buy yourself multi-system TV. Cause this player can NOT handle PAL<->NTSC conversion.I tried several PAL DVDs (multi-zone disks) to watch on my NTSC TV. The result was horrible :(Instead of interpolation, it just skips every 6th line (you can imagine how straight lines look like).And it can not handle anamorphic PAL DVDs, image is stretched vertically.One has to have PAL TV to watch PAL DVDs, I believe.Other than that it's a good player (for $43 :)"
4,"Not the hottest DVD player, but...","Don't listen to that guy who couldn't play DVD-R's; I successfully played one on this player (two of them, in fact) some people had in my dorm hall.It's neat that this player can be region-free...like that!This player can successfully play an extended ""Lord of the Rings"" DVD set.While there's no DTS output to be found, I can see some people getting this player!"
1,It's disposable!,"This DVD player is the Bic lighter of home video. Like many other reviewers my player, too, saw limited use then locked up. Now it just shows a rolling menu screen. (The remote and the manual do not agree on terminology either)The DVD player market is flooded with junk and this APEX player is top of the heap. The garbage heap..."
4,no frills but good enough,"this player has worked for almost 2 years for me, and it plays all kinds of dvds fine. there's no digital display so you don't know how much time has elapsed. and the remote is very small so it's hard to know what to press in a dark room. but the player itself is really compact, which makes it better than my last more expensive player, which broke after a few months."
1,Irritating,"Avoid this player at all cost. I know this player costs about 30 dollars, but I received this player as a gift. It is my first DVD player so I wasn't really expecting anything with great performance. But what good is any DVD player if it doesn't play DVDs. About one month after I got it, it started to skip in both picture and sound on every single movie I put in. I've looked on many sites and this seems to be a common problem with this player. I suggest paying a few extra bucks for a better quality player."
2,Lemon?,"I bought this DVD player about a month ago. It was defective out of the box. It wouldn't play any of my DVD's. The DVD would spin up, spin down, and do that for about 2 minutes and then would display ""Bad Disc"". I promptly returned it to Amazon. I did like the size of the player though, it was nice and compact. The remote looked kind of dated, but hey it was only $37.99 when I bought it, so I can't really complain. It just would've been nice if it could actually play DVD's. Oh and it couldn't play music CD's either. I still think this DVD player is good deal, if you get one that works."
2,"It all depends on your luck, when it's Cyberhome CH-DVD","I bought four of them, for gitfts and personal use, because of compact size and affordable price. But unfortunately, only one of them worked well. Here are the problems I found: The drive opens up and close automatically when I tried to play a movie. It keeps doing it, again and again. The remote control does not work, even though the battery is working. The picture sometime gets garbled. When I returned them to 'Best Buy', the customer care told me that these all are known issue. I just thought to let you guys know about it. I still recommend buying it, but make sure that, in case needed, you can return it."
1,Going back to the store!,"This player did play DVD-R/+R, -RW, and +RW, but not well. It kept dropping frames (that is, the video would pause and then skip forward), which is generally a symptom of an MPEG decoder that can't keep up with the bitrate of the DVD. But the DVD was authored at 7.5Mbps max (average 5.5Mbps), and the DVD Forum standards specify that a DVD player must handle 9.8Mbps."
3,Decent Inexpensive Player,"I happened to be in the market for a small, cheap DVD player and found this model at Best Buy for only $30. At that price, I figured I had little to lose. While I've only had it a few weeks and run only 8-10 hours of DVDs through it, so far so good. On the plus side, it's played everything OK. But when I compare its image quality with my Toshiba player (3 yrs old), the Cyberhome just isn't as sharp, nor does it give colors the rich, saturated look that I like. So, if you're looking for a cheap player and don't mind giving up some image quality compared to the Sonys and Toshibas and Panasonics, you're likely to be happy. As for the machine's longevity, who knows?"
2,Inexpensive but has problems playing many movies.,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my sister as her first DVD player. I figured it would be an ok player to last a short time until she could afford one on her own. Unfortunately it had problems playing about 1/2 of the movies we tried in it. It would frequently freeze up on a frame for a few moments before continuing, or lock up on that frame altogether without continuing. The latter happend on the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition. When it did lock up, very often it would take a long time for the remote control or the front panel buttons to respond again, such as to go back to the main menu or even eject the disk. The same disks had no problems playing in another DVD player, so it was definitely the players fault. I'm exchanging this one for a different brand."
1,Cheap Chinese Electronics,"Like many other purchasers, I was impressed by the low ($39) price, Region Free and PAL capability when I bought this DVD player 2 years ago. It just inexplicably stopped working yesterday. Looking up Cyberhome, it seems the trademark and domain name is up for sale(?). 2 years and throw it away seems to be the world we live in. Are there any DVD players not made in Asian slave factories?"
1,Not the Energizer bunny . . .,"This one just won't keep going, and going, and going. When it worked it was fine. However, I have owned two and both quit working on me in fairly short order, the second one in less than a year. Maybe I shouldn't expect too much for the price, but still was disappointing to me."
1,"mostly bad, a little good","I have owned two of these dvd players. Both of them worked for a while and then both of them just stopped working. It doesn't seem to read the disk. I would only recommend if you don't mind buying a new one every year. Both of them lasted between 9-12 months and the remote died, and shortly after that, the whole thing died. It also is missing an actual menu button on the dvd player itself. I could never go to the menu when my remotes stopped working. It was good while it worked though. I just wish it didn't obviously have some sort of a bug since both did the exact same thing."
3,Cyberhome DVD player review,"I was disapointed that the zoom feature mode of operation was changed. I had one before that stopped playing but I liked the zoom feature it had. It worked by presenting a frame within the picture when the zoom button was pressed and then by pressing Enter, the view within the frame was enlarged. This could be repeated has many times as you want. The current one only enlages by 2x, 3x and 4x. That's all. Otherwise I like the player and it is inexpensive and compact. I use it mostly to view JPEG pictures on disk."
1,[CyberHome CH-DVD 300S Progressive-Scan DVD Player (Silver)],"Would rate it 0 stars if that were an option!!!! Very spotty performance! Audio comes and goes on a whim. CyberHome doesn't respond to email or phone calls, and now it seems that their website is closed. When it works, it is fine, but it doesn't work consistently, and with no customer service it seems a risky thing to buy--even at a low price.[...]"
1,donot buy,"I agree that this player is noisy . Also it doesnot play some DVDs , with picture skipping . My last experience was when I rented (Master and commander DVD ) which was just recently released , and my DVD will not play beyond track 15 though I went back to the video store and changed the DVD and still I had the same problem . It seems that this DVD player doesnot have consistancy among custemers , which means that the quality may be different from one player to another . Anyway I donot think it is worth taking the risk."
1,Beware of the higher cost of the lower price.....,"This player is a very cute little package for a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the exterior design quality isn't reflected in the interior components. So.....I'm sending this back! I viewed my first movie last night. The picture was inconsistent and the drive was *very* noisy. I also found the sound quality to be poorer than my 1988 VCR. The second DVD I attempted to view froze up in the first 5 minutes. Not a positive experience."
1,Great... for Black & White... won't play color!,"My experience has been identical with other users mentioned here. The unit worked fine for a brief time, then quit playing in color - showing only black & white. I contacted CyberHome and they swapped out the unit for a new one, not super fast, but in a matter of weeks at least. Amazingly... new unit did the same after a coupleof weeks. Finally it made a popping noise and died all together. Can't see how they can stay in business like this!"
2,extremely noisy but plays almost anything,"i agree with the previous post that this player is very noisy. you can hear the whining and sqeeks as the disc loads and plays (compared to my cyberhome ch-dvd 500 which is silent). i had to pad the bottom ventilation slots with foam to keep the noise down. however, this dvd player plays pretty much anything you throw to it (dvd+-r/rw, vcd, cd, mpeg, avi, pal/ntsc, etc.). if you don't mind the noise (and subsequent heat) and can live without seeing the display panel then this is a good buy."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I would give this unit less than 1 star if I could. The DVD player looks like a great buy, and looks nice from the outside, unfortunately this does not translate to the electronics. The unit is extremely noisy and was unable to deliver a sharp picture right out of the box. It had trouble reading older discs rented from the video store. I bought a new disc to experiment and the player would read only up to track 15. This was a huge waste of my time and money. Don't waste yours."
2,remote control?,i liked this dvd player until i had problems with the remote and ended up having to buy a new one. the new remote plus shipping ended up costing around $18 dollars. which is sick considering that the player is only around $40.
2,Terrible playback quality on low-rate DVDs,I have attempted to play some low-bitrate DVDs (i.e. VCD-quality recordings on a DVD disc) and the video output is jittery and unwatchable! Beware!
1,not worth a dollar,"This DVD player is probably the shoddiest piece of electronic equipment i have ever bought. It feels very tinny and cheap when you pick it up and what's more, after three months - conveniently when I was unable to return it - it just stopped reading my DVDs. I suppose the price is nice, but you get what you pay for. And I certainly wasted the little money that I did spend on this player."
2,planned obsolecence or just crappy parts?,"the reason i give it 2 stars is that its a pretty cool little unit, until it goes awayits just a damn shame that in our use and abuse, rape and pillage, disposible material culture that cyberhome takes it to a new level by giving such a short lifespan to an otherwise useful piece of equipmenti dont care if its only 40 buckswhat is the point? oh i know, i know, pushing more productbut comeon, give us a year at leastmine worked great for 4 monthsif you already have this unit or are gonna buy one anyway, here is a work of advice...unplug the unit when you are not using itthe unit draws almost as much power when its off, as when its onmy friend does this with his and it has lasted over a year"
1,"If you like cheap bad DVD players, buy this","man, i was flipping with joy when i was passin by an isle in best buy and saw a 25$ DVD player. since i got a 20$ gift card there, 5$ was the measly price i paid for it. when i played a dvd in it, it skipped so much. i thought that it was only in the beggining, but i was wrong. this was such a bad dvd player. please, dont buy it."
1,CyberHome DVD player is junk,"Bought mine about two months ago and I am very disappointed with the unit's performance. As the disk spins it makes a very loud noise that forces you to turn up the TV volume to drown it out. Also, there are skipping/reading problems with nearly every DVD - I never have this problem with my JVC DVD player. I like the compact design, it's a shame it lacks quality. Your get exactly what you pay for - spend a little more an buy a DVD player that works!!TRUpdate: 12/04 The updated version of this player is excellent.There is slight model number change - same size/features and price. Took the plunge after reading a review (forget where) and I'm very happy. Now I have a compact player that works very well!! I give it 5 stars. I returned older player back to Target."
2,Throwing out today!!!,Throwing this dvd player out right now and it's probably only been used around 20 times.. Just purchased a replacement for it sony sr200. The problem with this dvd player is it plays well for about 35 minutes and then it makes noises and then it starts skipping and stopping until you can't take it anymore and turn it off.
1,!!WARNING!! !!PLANNED OBSOLENCE!!,"ZERO STARS GIVEN but i have to at least give one>:(don't waist your money on something thats going to die with out probable cause. ive owned 2 of these. the 1st one i bought at a store and the 2nd one i bought at a garage sale after the 1st one died. now the 2nd one died with out probable cause just like the 1st one. your better off spending a little more on a more respectful brand than something cheap!!Planned obsolescence or built-in obsolescence in industrial design is a policy of deliberately planning or designing a product with a limited useful life, so it will become obsolete or nonfunctional after a certain period of time. Planned obsolescence has potential benefits for a producer because to obtain continuing use of the product the consumer is under pressure to purchase again, whether from the same manufacturer (a replacement part or a newer model), or from a competitor which might also rely on planned obsolescence."
4,great bargain,"I bought this dvd player in July and I am suprised at how well it works. It skips much less than more expensive players I've used and I've never had a problem with it. It might not last as long as more expensive ones but you could buy two for the same or less amount of money than more expensive ones. So far I'm glad I bought it. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me is the fact that it has no lcd panel, but it isn't necessary and not worth spending more just for the display. I would highly recommend it."
2,Cheap for a reason,"I, like others, was lured by the price of this player. When it's actually *playing* a DVD, I've been pleased...good picture and such. However, with every DVD, the picture will freeze at least once and require being reset. Most recently all it does is power on (and I've only owned it a couple of months). Now my new DVD is trapped inside, and neither the remote nor the front buttons seem to be registering anything. I'm glad that some people have been pleased, but be warned: this is clearly an inconsistently made product at best...and at worst, not worth the styrofoam in which it was packed."
3,capacitor broke,"After using one year, Capacitor was broken.But it is cost effective, since I can see regional 1 DVDs inJapan, region: 2 area with lot cheaper. Next time it wouldbe broken, I maybe buy another one.Mits"
4,Zone-free but that's all!,"I already have a home-theater Panasonic but I bought this DVD player last week-end to be able to read zone 2 dvd's. The code given in the other reviews works fine and the quality of the picture is pretty good. BUT, no dolby surround decoder, no DTS decoder etc.... So, don't expect to get a surround effect or the sound that you could have with a home-theater. But, If you want to use it as a backup or, like me, to read other zones, go for it!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This player is not region free, as some have claimed. It had trouble playing certain foreign and indie DVDs (not DVD-Rs, mind you) from day one. Some disks just wouldn't play at all, even though they played fine in other players. After 5 months (not long after the warranty ended), the player completely crashed. Won't play anything now. If it does play, it stops after the 4th or 5th chaper - just freezes and has to be ejected and reloaded to even get the menu. Tried emailing the manufacturer and predictably they never answered. In short, this thing plays okay (and just okay) until the warranty is up."
1,Warning: Steer Clear of This Product!,"This machine appears to be a good deal, but it is not. When I got mine, the remote did not work. It was a hassle to contact the manufacturer for a new one--I had to send the defective one to the manufacturer, at my own expense, in order to get a replacement.After having a defective remote, the unit itself stopped working within eight months of very light use. I was halfway through a DVD when the player just flipped out. It would not read the disc, the picture rolled, the color switched back and forth between color and B&W, and the words ""Bad Disc"" appeared on the screen. The disc was brand spanking new, and after playing it in two other DVD players since this fiasco, I know it is not defective whatsoever. I am lucky this junkie Cyber Home DVD player did not ruin it!It may have nice features and may be compact and cheap, but this unit is a lemon. Do yourself a favor and buy a better product--one that will actually last!"
1,Major flaw,"This is a very noisy machine when a disc is playing. The racket ruins the experience of using this otherwise remarkable unit. My six year old persuaded me to keep it for him because ""I like the noise it makes, Daddy."""
1,JUNK,"We bought this for an extra DVD player in our master bedroom. We really liked the price & compact size & it worked good when we got it home. But it lasted a whopping 2 months before the sound croaked. We probably played a total of 3 DVD's on it. Fortunately, we were able to return the item for the full cost & buy a different brand for a bit more money.I would definately recommend looking for a better brand DVD player rather than this one. You will have to spend a bit more but it would probably be worth it, knowing the trouble we have had with this one."
1,"good price, good features BUT freezes frequently","works fine for a while, then towards middle or end of movie frame freezes; tested dvd in another player = no problem;this is my second unit with same problem. Cyberhome says it is a problem with my specific unit and that they will replace ..."
1,I just use only 1 month. It's not work.,"I just bought on Dec 12,2005. Now it is not work. It show ""Loading"" when I load a CD. and can not do anything except eject."
2,Poor MP3; pedestrian DVD quality,"On first use, the DVD played with lurches and gaps, but after 15 minutes, it played nearly perfectly. It did manage to play a Chinese import DVD that my other player would not.I bought this player for playing MP3 discs away from the main entertainment area, but it's no good for that, so I'm returning it. The good news is that it will play a MP3 DVD, so you can get a LOT of music (60+ hours) on one DVD. The bad news is that MP3 playback has lots of hiccups, extraneous noises (sometimes very loud, be very careful when playing it loud, you could toast your speakers). It also plays MP3s only in alphabetical order by 8-char filename (no shuffle play).I love it that you can reprogram the thing to be multi-region. That with pedestrian ability to play DVDs for only $30 (Circuit City) wins 2 stars. But I won't own it long enough to see if it dies an early death, like everyone else says."
2,This player doesn't play DVD+R disc,I bought this player at BestBuy and it worked fine for me for a few weeks until I put in a DVD+R disc and it didn't play as advertised.I recommend don't buy this player. You should pay some extra bucks to buy the Philips DVP642 ($62.94 at Amazon) which is a really good player.
1,The bigggest load of rubbish I have come across!!!!!!!!!!!!,"One star is to good for this product. I only bought this yesterday, 11/05/04, I am now returning it to Best Buy a day later.I have managed to get this awful DVD player to switch on twice, both times it has not played a thing for me. It has swallowed my DVDs, I had to force it open to get them out.I have never come across such a hopeluss piece of technology in my life. If anyone wants to buy this then they need to get their head examined.To summarise. The Cyberhome CH DVD 300 is a guaranteed P.O.S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beware!,"2 of my friends bought this thing:--One of them could not play any discs - they just stopped after 20-30 minutes and returned to the main BLUE screen!(and they were brand new store bought or rented DVDs!)Luckily he was able to return it in time!--On the other one the COMPONENT VIDEO (the 3 red,blue,green outputs)was useless - the picture was just RED, although the regular AV output is working. She is stuck with it now!So 2 out of 2 are bad!!"
2,not actually a multy system DVD player,"it's very slick, tiny, nice looking player (bought it for $43 in local WalMart).It plays all media I tried. And all formats. Though some SVCDs showed slight A/V-asynch (on other players these disks are fine).As to the DVD - very good player. But make sure you stick to the one system (NTSC or PAL), or buy yourself multi-system TV. Cause this player can NOT handle PAL<->NTSC conversion.I tried several PAL DVDs (multi-zone disks) to watch on my NTSC TV. The result was horrible :(Instead of interpolation, it just skips every 6th line (you can imagine how straight lines look like).And it can not handle anamorphic PAL DVDs, image is stretched vertically.One has to have PAL TV to watch PAL DVDs, I believe.Other than that it's a good player (for $43 :)"
1,What happened to the region code free setting??? HELP!,"Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to ""0"" to watch all DVD's.After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to ""1"" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings ""1"" and ""-"". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank you"
1,Cheap but unreliable,The price was great but after 2 months my first unit started making loud noises during playback. I returned it under warranty. The next unit I got stopped playing DVD's altogether after 1 week.Cyberhome products do not seem very reliable.
1,Keep away!!!!!!!!,"I bought three of these last year as xmas present for friends and family when they were on sale at brandsmart for 30 dollars. Within 3 months one stop working and no longer turns on. The other one over heats and then no longer play after an hour. The last one, the buttons on the unit itself no longer work, you will have to use the remote. Then it keeps turning itself on for no reason. I can understand if one was defective but all three broke within a year. Even if there is a warranty, I'm not even going to bother. KEEP AWAY!!!"
1,gonossatan,"The only reason I bought this DVD player is to play my foreign region DVD's which it is supposed to do. But is DOES NOT! It is a scam, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
1,CYBER JUNK,"Tiltle of this review tells the whole story. Although the unit is very low priced, it still is not worth the $$$. Unit remote does not function from more than 8 feet from the player. If you have to set this unit up thru your home theater system, good luck (have your receiver manual handy) since the user manual was created it seems like in 20 minutes. On a positive note, I purchased the Norcent DP300 and the unit is awesome. Check it out and read the reviews."
1,You get what you pay for,"I've had this DVD player for about a year now, which is saying a lot. What it isn't saying is that every two weeks, I have to take it apart and put it back together again because it decides to randomly seize up and not respond to either remote commands or commands on the console itself. I've had to unscrew the top of the device to get my DVD out on several occasions. So if you are okay with spending $40 on something that won't always work, that you'll have to service every other week, then by all means. I'm retiring my player and getting a Sony or Panasonic one instead."
1,"Did not work, RETURNED","Avoid this one. I read the poor reviews about the unit's short lifespan, overheating, etc. But, I decided to take a chance on it based on its low price and many features. Well, it would not play ANY of the many commercial DVDs I tried, not to mention burned ones. It always displayed BAD DISC. I decided that the lifespan of zero days was indeed short, too short, so I returned it. Kudos to Amazon for paying shipping both ways. Hopefully I will be refunded without incident.Lastly, Amazon has increased the price on this since my purchase, so buyer beware."
1,Short term purchase only,"I have owned two of these. The first one lasted 1 week, the second six months. If you plan to get a lot of use out of your DVD player, this is not the one to buy."
1,Works great for 3 months then dies!,"Except for the very small buttons on the remote I really liked this small, feature-laden unit until the picture started ""jittering"" after about 15 disks and a few days prior to the skimpy 90 day warranty expiring. I thought the replacement one good until it started ""jittering"" after maybe the 25th disk and about 2 months after the warranty expired. Piece of junk- don't waste your money."
2,Only great while it's working,"This player worked well for me for about eight months, then crapped out, to the point where I couldn't even power it on. It's not a bargain if it only lasts that long."
2,Nice while it lasted,"This DVD player was great but the laser died out after a couple of months.As far as features go this was great. It plays mpegs & jpegs right off of burned discs. I was even able to play mp3s off a burnt dvd, many players will on play off of regular cds. It was also region free and played PAL discs with no trouble at all.The picture quality defenitly was subpar. But for $40, you can't complain."
1,Disposable DVD Player,"After 6 months of use,this unit would freeze while playing a DVD and I would have to turn power off and then back on to play a DVD. This would work for a while and then it would freeze again. After a year the unit quit working completely. I could not find any information to contact the company about the problem.I would not suggest buying a Cyberhome unless you want a disposable DVD player you are going to replace every year."
1,Bought One... Brought It Back The Next Day...,"I too was enticed by the relatively low price ($40 Can). I brought it home, set it up and put in a DVD. Right away, I noticed something wasn't right when the player would ""jump ahead"" to Chapter 2 instead of starting at the beginning of the disc. It did this with several DVD's. My next complaint was the freeze-ups and pixellation on the screen. Sometimes the unit seemed to ""get stupid"" and wouldn't respond to the remote. That, along with reading these other reviews, was enough to convince me to pack everything back up and return it to Wal*Mart. Not surprisingly, the customer service rep said that a TON of these things came back for the same reasons. Live and learn I guess. Stay away. Typical mass-market junk. I'm going to try a Toshiba or Sony or something else. Caveat Emptor. Don't be enticed by the low price and small size. You get what you pay for and I gurantee you'll be sorry."
1,good until...,my player stopped reading dvds just after the 3-month warranty expired. buyers beware.
1,Worst DVD player ever,"I have typically regretted few electronic purchases I've made, but this is one. This was one of the few I didn't research before I bought it, and I've learned my lesson. Within the first week the remote stopped working (not that it worked well to begin with). A battery change did nothing. It occasionally will not recognize a DVD I load. If I try to play burned DVDs, it always skips for a while and then freezes towards the end. Spend a little more money and buy a real DVD player."
1,POS,"This player is AWEFUL. Mine stopped playind DVDs today...everything. I got it on the cheap cheap cheap...and that's what it is. Aside from the noise while playind discs, the remote interface is FAR FROM intuitive and the remote runs on a watch battery.Do yourself a favor and buy a Toshiba."
2,Died after 4 months,"Waste of money.Worked OK for about 4 months and then it died (average use was less than 1 hour/day). Electrical burn smell in the room and the picture became messed up. That's it. Dead, just after the 90-day warranty period. Disappointing, since the unit feels solid, nice buttons, mechanism, Made in Taiwan (not China). Still did not last.PAL-NTSC conversion is only so-so. Not the proper aspect ratio, so widescreen PAL movies are squeezed and thus people become very skinny. A better option are the Philips or JVC players that provide a proper letter-box picture and preserve the original picture."
1,I would give this -1 star but it doesnt let me,"This dvd player is absolutely horrible!! I bought it because it says it plays all dvd formats - + r and rw, and most of the dvds I own are burned..well it played them but only the first few scenes and then they skip and get stuck... They play absolutely fine on my new panasonic dvd s25s I just bought..all formats even when the product only advertises that it plays dvd-r's... I guess you get what you pay for"
5,Awesome DVD players for incredible price,"This is just loaded with features, great quality, plays anything under the sun and is so small, it's just unbelievable.We just LOVE ours!!!!!"
1,Junk,I purchased my original unit years ago at Sam`s club.Unit was compact and did the job for years then the tray would stick and unit wouldn`t close .Thinking that I had good service for years I would by a same brand replacement .Purchased a replacement and it would whirl and freeze .Unplug and it would reset but do the same action 1/2 to 3/4 thru a movie .Requested a replacement or credit and was plesently surprised when the seller {sadlshoe} responded that credit for unit would be issued No Hassle no Drama .STAY AWAY from this brand and avoid the problems
1,CyberHome - Garbage,CyberHome = Worst quality products.Email CyberHome three times. No response.They don't support their products.
1,Always check the warranty!,"Mp3s took a while to load, and there was no way to use the remote without staring at it for five minutes, but otherwise, everything was fine... until it broke JUST after 3 months of use -- no power would come into the unit all of a sudden. I called customer service and found out that it would cost more than the price of the unit just for labor.HERE'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT:After reading tons of customer reviews of all different DVD players, the conclusion I've come to is that if you spend under $200, you pretty much either get lucky and get a working unit, or you don't. Therefore, now that I'm shopping for my new one, I am ONLY looking at units with a one-year parts AND labor warranty. That way, I'm guaranteed to get at least a year out of the unit, which is better that it dying after 3 months. Then if it lasts longer, it's gravy."
4,Discover Bellydance DVD,I thought the DVD was very good. I wish it were an hour instead of just 45 minutes. It was very easy to follow. I liked that you saw the performance first then they showed you how to do it.
4,Little stiff but great for practice,"I am impressed with this video. It is the best one I've found yet for basic moves. Unfortunatly it doesn't give step by step or guidlines on what to be carefull of in learning hte moves, nothing on safety, and little details of what is happening but as someone who's had some training it was a great video for practice when classes or instruction is unavailable.I'd recomend it for fitness or basic introduction to moves as long as you have someone else you can refer to for one on one advice. It's better than some of the other videos in their fitness set."
3,Great if you have no idea how to belly dance.,"Before purchasing this tape, I knew that it was called, ""Basic Dance"". But, I didn't comprehend how ""basic"" it was going to be. If you already have an idea how to bellydance, then this is definetly NOT the tape for you. I already knew how to bellydance but I wanted to learn some new moves and perfect what I was already doing. This tape doesn't do that for me. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money for me. I did it once and quickly learned everything in it. I still have the tape and would love to sell it-- it is practically brand new. Let me know if you'd be interested."
3,A fascinating hero,"After seeing the movie I wanted to learn more about the characters and looked specifically for the first Alex Cross mystery by James Patterson-this IS the first book in the series. The main character, Detective (and Phd. in Psychology) Alex Cross is a fascinating character. Two of the other major characters weren't as well developed as I would have liked and after finishing the book I felt I was left with a lack of enough information to fully understand (and in the case of one of them-barely understood) the ""why"" of crime committed. I don't want to give out too much information about the book and risk spoiling it for anyone but I definitely wouldn't have seen the end coming if I hadn't already seen the movie.Make sure to read Kiss the Girls next! Cross' character is much further developed and it's a more fascinating read.Somewhat intriguing but in comparison I felt Kiss the Girls was a better written book."
3,"A Good Mystery ""K.W. Per. 7""","The book was good and I enjoyed reading it. Putting it down was hard to do, especially toward the end. Although there were a few parts that were a little boring, most of the book was action packed. In the middle, things happened that really made me wonder what was going to happen in the end. Gary Soneji, the murderer and kidnappper, is always a step ahead and always has a plan that he has gone over in his head many times. That is what makes the book so interesting. Being a step ahead and not trusting everyone are two of the most important factors in the book. Everytime I thought Soneji was going to get caught, something different would happen, the book was very unpredictable. Along Came a Spider was a good book and I recommend that everyone takes the time to read it."
4,"clever, suave and unpredictable (for most part)","If there's ever a book which will keep you turning the pages, Along Came a Spider is it. I read this book after watching Kiss the Girls, and I wasn't disappointed. The characters are unpredictable and the twists keep coming almost too much so, but Alex Cross is a down to Earth character in which unlike other characters of similar books, is easy to relate to. Jeese Flannagan the main female in the book, is definitely a girl i would go out with, independent, a little manipulative, no weak charcters here. Definitely a worthwhile read!"
2,"Ok, but not all that","This is the first review I've written, and it is also the first James Patterson book I have read. This book to me is a lot like a TV movie, kinda entertaining but not real engaging. The plot twists, while unexpected, aren't suprising. The ""romance"" with Jezzie is pretty lame, but I guess it was integral to the plot even though where it led was even worse. The only characters that I thought were good were the kids and Gary was ok. Nobody really talks like the characters in this book. I have a two relatives that are police detectives and I never hear them refer to themselves as a couple of ""tough cops"" like they do in this book. ...."
1,Yawn,"If the only book you have ever read was the Waikicamucau (pop. 13) telephone directory, then this would be the second-best book you ever opened.If you are 9 years old or younger, you may find this as exciting as eating spinach. Without salt.If you are sophisticated enough to realise that a story should be credible, make sense, and entertain you - then leave this book on the shelf.There's a four-letter word: it starts with CR, and rhymes with PAP. You should know it. It's extravagant praise for this book.Avoid this book like the plague. Avoid anything written by James patterson like the plague. In fact - if you are given a choice, take the plague. You'll feel better."
4,Solid but not spectacular,"I thought I'd give this a go due to the immense popularity James Patterson has garnered. I enjoyed this run of the mill detective novel but not as much as I enjoy Harlan Coben & Michael Connelly's detective novels. The hero ""Alex Cross"" is a detective who has psychology qualifications.Moderately recommended."
4,The Alex Cross legacy begins.,"This is James Patterson's first novel starring his well rounded hero Alex Cross. A brilliant African American detective with a higher moral agenda than your average suspense novel protagonist. In Along Came a Spider we are introduced to Patterson's seamless blending of first and third person narrative that works so well with a many faceted character such as Alex Cross. This book succeeds on many levels: as the villian Gary Soneji is trully vile but not unbelievably so, the supporting characters such as Alex's family are made interesting and revelant to the story, and it progresses quickly with twists and turns that lead to a surprisingly emotional ending. Along Came a Spider has a little of everything: criminal psychology, courtroom drama, love, murder, kidnapping, insightful family interaction, and the kitchen sink! This is a smartly written, superior book!"
4,"Good,but he's done better!!","His characters are interesting as always. The killer in the story is captured way to early in the story,but as always Patterson makes his unexpected twist in characters and turns of events in the story get interesting once again.I liked Hide and Seek, and diffentlly Jack and Jill better than Along came a Spider."
4,AL0ong Came a Spider MN,"I thought Along Came a Spider was a great story with a terrific plot and well drawn characters;however, I didn't feel that much attachment to the story after it was over. Again, the characters however were great"
2,Disappointing,"Little Miss Muffit sat on her tuffit eating her curds and whey. Along Came a Spider and sat down beside her and bored her to tears! This book was o.k., but nowhere near as good as the other Alex Cross novels. The only reason why I do reccomend it is beacuse of the continuation in Cat and Mouse. Otherwise, I would have said avoid it all together."
4,Not like the movie,"Great book and a very good movie. However, that being said, don't try to compare the two. I kept waiting for more similarities to the movie. These similarities didn't happen. Well worth reading but I probably would have enjoyed it a LOT more if I hadn't seen the movie. I enjoyed the plot and the characters."
3,Along Came a Spider,Just started reading James Patterson's books. Really enjoyed it and will continue to read all of the series.Enjoyed the family aspect of Dr. Cross and his Nana.
4,Great Book-Fast Pace,"I would strongly recommend this book even if you never read any Alex Cross novels, as was the case with me. It is a fast pace book which means you will never put it down. It also keeps you alert while you read it, and before you know it the story will end."
4,The Spider sat down beside--HIM!!!,"This was a wonderful read. The book centers around a psychopath who gets his kicks by murdering people. Some are planned murders and some others are on the spare of the moment. His most recent victims were children of the rich and famous who reside in the Washington, D.C., Maryland areas.But have no fear, homicide detective, and psychologist, Alex Cross, Ph.D. is to the rescue. He stays on the psychopath's trail until he is beaten to a pulp. Additionally, I loved the way Dr. Cross does not let the young and beautiful Jezzie Flanagan trick him into believing that she had fallen in love with him. Now that does not mean that he didn't enjoy slipping between the sheets with her little creamy white body for carnal satisfaction. But that was all it was. In the end, Dr. Cross took care of business in a way that would make you proud. Read it for yourself and see if you agree."
4,A bit disappointing for Patterson fans.,"Although I found myself unable to put this book down, I was a bit disappointed with the overall story. I enjoyed the suspense, however, I found the details of the story unrealistic, predictable, and overdramatic. Patterson does deliver a thought-provoking and page-turning novel."
4,ACTION PACKED SUSPENSEFUL,"I AM USUALLY A KOONTZ, SAUL, KING FAN, THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I READ OF JAMES PATTERSONS, AND NOW I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!! HE IS TRULY A GREAT WRITER"
2,First Alex Cross book read,"Good story but a lot of very fowl, unnecessary language. Sometimes the fowl language got in the way of understanding what he meant to convey."
5,Enticing,The book is hard to put down. It keeps you indulged inside the book and very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
3,mystery with twist,I enjoy reading J>P> books and found this one to be less gripping as some of his others-not his best effort but interetaining.
4,Meet Gary Soneji for the 1st time,"To me, Gary Soneji is FAR and AWAY a better crafted character than Hannibal Lecter is. Almost jumping off the pages and into your nightmares is what James Patterson manages to succeed in doing to you. Here is fair warning: IF you have a penchant for dreaming about the books you read, you may want to avoid Patterson's books at all costs! His characters are SO BAD they almost defy the words in the English language to fully describe. Gary Soneji is also one thing many serial killers are not: He is VERY smart (maybe not smart enough NOT to kill, but pretty darned intelligent) but he is also hopelessly past all ability to rehabilitate, too. Patterson's pace is so fast that there is practically a new chapter on every-other-page. The pacing is like a semi coming down a steep grade with no brakes. Watch OUT! If you are into SMART storytelling (Gary Soneji isn't the ONLY smart one in this book) than Patterson's Alex Cross novels are the bar by which everyone else is judged."
4,Another thriller,"Once again, Patterson keeps turning the pages. You are completely immersed in the story and its characters and boom, a curve ball. You are sucked in alongside Alex Cross trying to analyze the psychopaths."
4,Great Book!!!!,"Page Turner!! First James Patterson Book of the series of Alex Cross. It was great. Based on another reviews, this book was the most recommended of the Alex Cross Series."
2,First Alex Cross Book,I just did not like the story. I doubt I will purchase another Alex Cross. I do like most of Patterson's books.
2,Product Quality Not Up To Standards,"In early April I found that you were offering a hardcover printing of Along came A Spider by James Patterson so I placed one on order as a gift for my wife. Subsequently it was back ordered and I received it almost 12 weeks after I originally placed the order. Upon opening the box I found that it was not a ""real"" hardcover book but a paperback book with a ""hard cover"". My expectations were that it would be a full size book printed on white paper not this imitation of a hardcover. To me, as to a lot of other consumers, the term ""hardcover"" implies a certain level of quality above that found in the average paperback. This was a Mother's Day gift and needless to say, I was rather disappointed in the quality of the item received."
2,Didn't enjoy.,"The biggest thing to me is when I read novels by black authors about black charaters, their voice is different, the things they see and report are different. This writer, who is white, didn't seem to capture an authintic voice."
4,Very interesting...,Well written...a true page-turner...I like this book very much...strongly recommended...
4,tom,"an excellent show of a physchological, and thrilling action. Will keep you reading until you know the truth."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I really like ""serial"" books about a central character that is carried from book to book. The problem here is that the central character is never fully developed. Neither are the supporting characters. Patterson's writing style is to write in the first person for the main character and third person for the other characters. This lets us look into the minds of his characters, but he never makes me feel I am really into the story. The main character is constantly touting his own good traits and just comes off as phony to me. I do like the way he has a good twist for the endings of his books. I have read two and just don't know if I can read any more."
4,"The ""badguy"" Soneji is a very entertaining psycho!","The book is very exciting when Gary Soneji comes on, because you know that something terrible is going to go wrong. Patterson is a excellant writer and should make a movie out of this one. A must read!"
3,Decent novel.,Rather shlocky in some parts. Lots of cliches but fast-paced and exciting. An easy and relaxing read.
2,disappointed,"After imagining Alex Cross in my mind and then seeing him on the screen, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Alex Cross novels will never hold the same enjoyment or interest.Not the handsome, polished, gentle, bigger than life character that Patterson wrote about."
2,Can't finish this book,"I'm not sure why so many people like this book. I am about half way through it, trying to finish as I paid $9.99 for it. But, it is really depressing. I've read other James Patterson books, but this one is a struggle."
4,Intense,"A powerful, mesmerizing tale of human nature - hope, love, greed, and the desire to see justice served. Alex Cross is a man we would all like to have in our lives."
5,Along Came a Spider,Held your interest. Well written. I would read another James Patterson book such as Along Came a Spider. Excellent book
2,Mad Libs,"Once again I have to say that once you've read all the books in the Alex Cross series you'll understand what I mean by ""Mad Libs"". You start to see patterns and the stories become easier to figure out. It's almost as though Patterson has a template he uses to write his books. The thing I hate most are the italics. I don't need italics to suddenly ""realize"" that I'm supposed to be shocked or feel some emotion. I'm not an emotionless drone that spends all of my life outside of work watching the idiot box. Patterson really ought to start writing for ""real"" people."
2,Along came a spider,"This is the writing of a novice. Very poor scenario description. A lightweight women driving her motorcycle with a large 6'-2"" man on the back going 130 mph on a BMW motorcycle through Washington DC at night in the dead of winter for over an hour and right from the office AND with no mention of wind chill or frostbite. Let alone finding any road in Washington DC you can go 130 mph without traffic. Most of the scenerios are just unrealistic. Author never made me feel as though I was there, it was just not convincing and not well thought out. Not a well thought out or investigated story, no real drama. Very novice writing with a limited vocabulary. Author better research what the suspect's rights are after he is arrested. Never heard from the suspect's attorney until almost the day of the trial, violated the suspects rights from the get go. Before I read another book by this author he has to do more research on criminal law."
5,A Delightful and Surprising Thriller,"Upon reading the novel, I encountered some very intricate and useful details about the book. I didn't have to worry about a slow or annoying plot in Along Came A Spider because it moved very quickly. Patterson did a great job of moving the characters right inot the feel of the novel. The characters were superb. There were many instances in which I felt like I was Detective Cross and my decisions would determine the outcome of sticky situations. Along Came a Spider was able to grab my attention and hold it. After the first couple of pages, I soon found myself unable to put the novel down at time that I knew I should have. Along Came A Spider truly impressed me to the fact that I can not wait to finish reading Patterson's next thriller, Kiss the Girls. If similar characters are involved, then I am sure the next one will be as delicious as Along Came A Spider."
2,A great way to start off the series,You will not be able to put this book down. Patterson has created the perfect antagonist with Gary Soneji. The writing is brisk and fast paced and the suprise ending will leave you guessing until the end. The book is damn near classic. The only regret is that towards the last 150 pages the books seems to be dragging on. I rate it more of a 3.5 than a four.
1,"not the worst, but close","Can someone tell me why James Patterson would have his black hero play and sing Public Enemy tunes on a piano? I thought it started decently enough (reminded me of John Sandford) but as I kept reading it became more and more ridiculous. By the time I got to that ""Public Enemy"" line, I had it. No more Patterson for me!"
4,Good Audio Book,"The audio book was very good. I was able to listen to it going to and from work each day. I have not seen the movie, so I do not know which version is better."
2,I want my money back!,"I am very disappointed with this book. The story may have made a beautiful movie (which I have never seen), but it does not pass master as reading. The characters are cardboard cutouts from the standard psychopatic egomaniacal killer to the Alex Cross'es family. There is one (yes, I mean ONE) plot twist that is more or less interesting, the rest is so rote it is funny. The writer has no skills whatsoever in building tension. He also cannot put together an interesting description. I will not even touch the dialog with a ten foot pole. And why on Earth do viewpoints have to shift all the time? We don't learn anything interesting when they do."
3,Alex the Superman,After reading all of the Alex Cross novels I must confess to being solidly ambivalent when it comes to recommending them to others. Patterson comes up with some unique and compelling villains that both pique the interest and turn the stomach. But he eventually makes them larger than life and omnipotent to the point of being like Jason in the Friday the 13th movies.Patterson also forgets his audience has most likely been exposed to a heavy dose of crime solving on TV and in the movies when he renders everyone except Cross so clueless when it comes to finding traces of the killers. Good thing for the rest of the country all serial killers find a way to involve Cross lest the rest of the nation's crime fighters spend all their time eating doughnuts while ignoring tools like DNA and fingerprints.Will I read the next installment? Yeah probably - but only to find out how Gary Sonje will come back to outlive Nanna-Momma.
2,Great book with a mediocre ending,"Great thriller throughout with some unbelievable turns. With all the imagination used to create the body of the book you would think the ending would have had more development and forethought. I could not put this book down and would not have guessed that after I turned the final page I would be so dissppointed. I want to be suprised at the end, not fed the predictable"
2,The grass is too green,"When I read a book and I keep reading and I get nothing of the main story I say that the writer is green dyeing the grass, since I already know that the grass is green with out dyeing it, I think that I don't have to read words that doesn't say anything, for example:The Jezzie-Alex's affair could be written in five lines at the beginning of the book and five more at the end so you can understand why she was a bad agent. The book has chapters and chapters of this affair.What happened with Alex's family is part of the book, but whatever they are going to have for breakfast every morning, who cares?The trial is boring and it repeats everything you already know.... And as the rabbit I can keep on and on..."
2,An OK read,"Maybe it's because I was just coming off reading ""Red Dragon,"" but I found this story to remind me too much of all the serial killer hype that I see so much of all over the place.It's not that this book was bad, it just didn't really do it for me. I mainly read it because I enjoyed the movie ""Kiss The Girls"" based on the Patterson novel of the same name. I thought that story was intriguing. This one, just didn't move me much."
3,Weak denouement,"Almost everything I wrote about ""Primal Fear,"" I could ditto for ""Along Came a Spider"" (so see that review for more). What is it with suspense writers these days that they're afraid to write a decisively satisfying denouement, meaning the bad guy gets his just rewards in the end. PF was dismal in this regard, but was better written (thus three stars). ACAS was not as well-written but came closer to a satisfying denouement (thus three stars). Closer . . . , but closer is not the same as closure. Most readers, I believe, would enjoy a well-written thriller where the author isn't writing with a sequel in mind, thus he can expose and terminate the villain instead of leaving him langouring in jail or in (or not in) a fugue state. Too simple, I suppose."
3,disappointed,"This was my first James Patterson book, let alone my first in the Alex Cross series. I admit I was a little disappointed.- I think that Cross himself is a terrible parent. He takes off and leaves his kids with his grandmother (their great-grandmother) constantly so that he can have a tryst with his girlfriend, seemingly without communication to the grandmother.- the main antagonist is supposed to be so smart and prepared, and we are to believe he got lazy and slipped up?- in a high-profile case that involves local P.D., the FBI, and the Secret Service, and every single one of them ignore a) vital clues / leads / evidence and b) an investigator close to the caseTruthfully, I also was pretty sure half-way through that I had figured out the entire mystery. I didn't have it 100%, but it was close. This wasn't a terrible book, but given the build-up for Patterson's Cross series, and the over-priced nature of this book, I certainly had higher expectations."
1,Not Worth The Money,"This book sounded good based on the synopsis and the plot line made for nice escapism. Unfortunately, I found most of the characters to be completely unbelievable. The dialogue from the main character, Alex Cross, was particularly bad and sounded like a white person pretending to be black. I am a fan of good thrillers and I can be fairly forgiving of flaws in novels but, in this case, I found the characters and dialogue so off-putting that it detracted from the otherwise inventive plot."
4,Great book !!!,"This book was fantastic!! Definitely not a waste of time. I am moving on to his next book, can""t wait."
2,Not very well written,Couldn't keep my attention. Bad dialogue. Boring. First Patterson book I ever attempted to read. I figured I would start at the beginning with his first but I was highly disappointed.
4,Nice start,"As my first James Patterson read, I was surprised by the simplicity of the book. It was interesting, quick, and had enough suspense to hold my attention."
5,Great! Great! Great! - I bought all his books!,"Dr. Cross is a great protagonist. Patterson is a great writer with a brilliant imagination. I was so pleased with Kiss The Girls, Hide & Seek, Jack & Jill, and Along Came A spider that I have bought all of the rest of his books! Black Market - so far so GOOD!"
3,Plot not as airtight as Scott Turow.,"This is a competent thriller: I stayed up to learn more even when I should have turned my lamp off and gone to sleep. I particularly commend Patterson for his ability to write believably from the point of view of someone from a different race. It sounded realistic to me; however I'm not African-American & I'd like to know how it sounds to someone who is.Patterson succeeds in creating ""life on the page."" The writing quality is not consistent. Cliches, redundancies and irrelevant descriptions disappointed me at times.I'll try to avoid writing a Spoiler Review, but a *very* illogical event was that someone who didn't murder receives the death penalty."
5,Gosh I'm not even done and I can't help but comment!,"This is an excellent book, I'm not yet finished, this is my first break, and I have to get back!!! It holds your true undivided attention, which it fully deserves!!! Best book I've read since The Silence of the Lambs!!!"
2,Two Stars...no better.,Sigh...lately it seems international #1 bestsellers are getting worse and worse. Shallow plot and characters pretty much describe Along Came A Spider. Waste of good money.This could make a good movie though. Isn't it strange that books nowadays read like your usual Hollywood movies cript?
5,super read,"Couldn't put it down, it's the first JP I've read and I'm headed out for another one. I found myself saying outloud ""I can't believe this!"" I stayed up so late reading this, that my boyfriend finally went out and bought me a little book light! I'm a Patricia Cornwell fan and have read almost all of hers, now I'm anxious to do the same with JP."
4,Difficult to put down.,"I really enjoyed this James Patterson novel. It is easy to read, grabs your attention, and keeps going. Mr. Patterson pulls you into the novel with his characters -- places you ""at the scene."" I was disappointed to read some of the other reader reviews of this book which were not very favorable. I recommend this book along with Jack and Jill. I found myself saying several times through each book, ""and the plot thickens. . . ."""
3,so... yeah,"The movie was much better, suprisingly.... It was much more concise and explained everything better. I could be biased because i like Morgan Freeman, but hey... the book was just too divergent from the main plot when it should have been spending more time explaining the how's and the why""s."
3,Boring,"I am a very big James Patterson fan but this book disappoints. I've read some of the later books in the series and I thought they were fantastic so I encourage you to keep reading. The the book had a unique and interesting plot, but the twists fell flat and the book was anti-climactic. A disappointing start to potentially awesome series."
4,Enjoyed it a lot,"Along Came a Spider, like all of James Patterson 's books, is a real winner as far as murder mysteries are concerned. As usual, once I started it, I had a lot of trouble putting it down!I look forward to the next Patterson book I read."
5,ALONG CAME A GREAT BOOK!,"Had a fine time solving the crimes with Alex Cross again. I could not put this book down, was up till the early morning hours finishing the mystery. The suspence is fantastic including a sensational twist."
4,"Good B+ thriller, but not an A","Intensely readable (among other things, the dialogue is consistently satisfying), and Cross is a fun character to read about, but the book is a bit too two-dimensional. The killer is too giddy, the surprise betrayer is implausible, and the climactic fight is disappointing. Still, it's better than most such and worth a read."
1,james patterson: Along came a spider,"This is the first book that I've read by this author, and most definitely the last. It is completely devoid of any craftsmanship;the plot is unbelievably sloppily laid out;the characters are one-dimensional."
1,"Ridiculous, implausible plot. This guy's a professional?","The characters are completely unbelievable and the story makes little sense. Like another lousy Patterson effort (""Hide and Seek""), this book reads like a bad prime-time soap opera. I'm so tired of authors who have an initial success and then cheat their readers by putting out junk (Baldacci is another example). The publisher figures...it doesn't have to be good, it just has to have the once-successful author's name on the cover. ""Cheated in Los Angeles"""
5,DEFINITELY A FIVE-STAR PLUS!,"Of all the James Patterson novels, this one is definitely at the top of the list. In this and subsequent novels, kidnapper, Gary Soneji is to Alex Cross as Hannibal is to FBI Agent Clarice Starling.Without going into the specifics of the book, all of which have been provided for you in the editorial reviews, this book is one of my all time favourites of James Patterson. It is packed with suspense, drama, a super A-1 plot and great characters. Be prepared for a long night ahead because it is a book you will not want to put down from start to finish. Also, at the top of the list is ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Cat and Mouse.""If you have read Patterson's later novels,""When the Wind Blows"" and ""Cradle and All,"" and are disappointed with what you have read, do not be discouraged. This book has all the punch and power of a real super thriller! You will not want to miss this book or the movie of the same name."
2,disappointed,"Disappointed to say that I dont see how this book gets great reviews. A friend suggested I read it, because I enjoy reading murder mysteries especially ones with reoccuring characters, but this book is dry. I read ""Kiss The Girls"" immediately after ACAS hoping it was better written, but it was worse. In both books the suspects exhibit better intelligence than the detective yet the detective somehow solves the mystery without explanation.It has an unabsorbing storyline with shallow unrealistic main characters. An easy read with predictable outcomes.Disappointing.Still looking for well written mysteries with reoccuring characters along the lines of the EARLY Cornwell stories and early Jonathan Kellerman."
2,actually awful but yeah suspenseful,i liked the sample and didnt know what people were saying when they were complaining about the writing but after actually buying the book and reading just a few pages further i completely get it. gooooodness i cant believe i bought this book. the two stars are for the pretty cliched but still suspenseful plot.
4,So good....,I really enjoyed this book. Suspense is great. cross is so like able. Look forward to more AC books. :)
3,Meh. It was fine.,"I prefer Dennis Lehane, but this book was alright. A nice, quick read if that's what yo are looking for."
5,Patterson is a master,I am a fan of all the Alex Cross books and this one starts the series with a bang. It is full of twists and turns and leaved the reader wanting more. I read this book and then couldnt wait to get ahold of the next one. This book and series is top notch
5,Sonji is mad,One of the best books I read in years. Can't wait together the next one. Son of Lindbergh is creepy
4,Liked this book very much!,James Patterson is one of my favorite writers. This one of his better books.
3,decent first novel in series,I have a brother who is really interestedin crime fiction and he has spoken highly of this series so I read the books not in order however. this is where you should start.the murderer is an intersting villain but it is the characterization of Cross his hrandmother and his best friend John Sampson that maid this book compelling and led me to read the rest of the series even though it shows the signs of a beginner in being overwritten at times despite the short chapters
5,ALONG CAME A SPIDER,"LOVE IT! COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! THE MOVIE IS GOOD TOO, BUT NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE BOOK."
3,Not Bad,"I thought this book was pretty good. Overall it was entertaining, but i felt like it was missing something. Patterson is very easy to read which makes this an easy page turner. Enjoy it, but dont expect too much."
3,Mistaken Identity,"For a long time, I've wanted this book for my James Patterson collection. I was very disappointed when I received it because it is a book club edition. All 36 of my other books by the author are the same size. It should have been clearly stated that this was not the regular hardback size. I would not have purchased it. I love Patterson's books because the clues in the mysteries are always hidden in plain sight. I should have read the books measurements and I would not have mistaken this book for the one I wanted. It was a case of mistaken identity."
4,NON-Stop Good Read!!!,after so many rave reviews this book got i finally got around this book.is very easy to read.....and also very suspenseful......you will finish the book in no time.........
5,Just what I want in a book!,"This book is wonderful! Suspenseful, twisting, and delicious, James Patterson has crafted quite the protagonist in Detective Alex Cross. Fans of Jeffery Deaver and others like him with devour this one!When Detective Alex Cross is removed from the murder of a poor black family to head the investigation of the kidnapping of two prominent white children, he is less than thrilled. He can see injustice all around, but is powerless to change the course of events to his liking. Making the best of a bad situation, he throws himself into the investigation and quickly learns that things are not as they seem at all.Most of the book deals with the examination of the kidnapper/murderer and that is easily the best part of the book. The villain is as twisted as they come, and the uncertainty of whether he really is crazy or just acting is possibly the most chilling part of all. Even the romantic elements of the story are shadowy and twisted in this page turner. Don't miss it!"
4,A murder mystery but defiantly not in the thriller genre,The actions and inter-actions of the authorities were not realistic as the Secret Service is responsible for protecting not for investigations. I can't imagine that a Secret Service agent just goes riding along with other authorities from time to time with no reporting back to or receiving directions from her office.I skip-read the uninteresting romantic parts of the book except at the end. The great ending is what saved this book from being a three star or less.Many of the reviews have said that this is his best book. I hope not as I have eleven more of his books on my desk waiting to be read.
2,A bit of a stretch,"I am a true Patterson fan, but did not enjoy this book. It does keep you interested enough to keep reading, but that is all that it has to offer. I felt that there were too many ""side plots"" going on which weren't necessary; as many people have also written, 500 words could have covered the amount of plot that happened in 500 pages. I felt that the ending was a stretch... it served well to patch things up nicely for a neat conclusion and left readers open for a continuation in the series, but did a patchy job at that. I don't always want a ""tidy"" ending, I want one that is interesting and intriguing yet believable.I do enjoy the ""Alex Cross"" series, and loved the next novel in the series ""Kiss the Girls"", so if you have read this one and weren't a fan, don't discriminate against some of his other offerings."
3,Along Came a Spider,"I'm probably going to be in the minority here (no pun intended) but I had had so many friends tell me about Alex Cross novels and this was my first one. I thought it was okay but not great. However, I will read more of Patterson's books and maybe they'll grow on me."
2,pretty bad,"This book is completely uninspired. Huge swaths of pages are almost unreadable. This is fiction at its worst, pressing every button to garner the highest thrill quota. Patterson does do a little better with his following novels `Kiss the Girls,' and 'Jack and Jill,' and this is his first novel I presume from over ten years ago, but it pales in comparison to some other better works. Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or `Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here).This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex. Its only saving grace is an interesting twisting plot line that really packs a well thought out wallop.Read the two in the series that I recommended and stay away from the rest of Patterson's toxic waste land."
2,Methinks that Mr. Patterson needs some direction...,"This, my third Patterson novel, (Kiss the Girls, Cat and Mouse), sadly was the best. After thinking about it some, (but not too much), I've come up with a few things that I think Mr. Patterson ought to consider:Thou shalt not create motiveless protagonists and antagonists.Thou shalt not create absolute protagonists and antagonists.Thou shalt not make your Caucasian readers, (especially those who are male) feel terrible for how they were born.Thou shalt not promote racism by masking it beneath grandmotherly charm.Thou shalt not forget that your readers have a gag reflex, when writing about Alex Cross's family life.Thou shalt not use excessive italics and (shudder) exclamation marks to emphasize that which even the most dimwitted reader knows to be important.And perhaps most importantly, Thou shalt not forget that sometimes less is more."
3,The Spider crawls,Along came a spider crawls along. I started reading Patterson with Cross and Double Cross both of which were heart pounding. Am continuing on my Patterson Quest based on the last two. Need to find out about X's beginnings.
4,Much better than the movie,"If you've seen the movie, do not let that stop you from reading the book. It is a great suspense novel and quite different from the movie...much more character development and more to the story."
5,James Patterson,NEVER NEVER a disapointment This book is no exceptionI always think he can't outdo the last one but he always doesCan't go wrong with this thriller
5,along came a spider,"It is a very good book. once I started reading it, I could not put it down. If all alex cross novels are this way, It will be a great summer of reading for me!!!"
4,Along Came a Spider,A good read. Interesting and carried the theme along at a good rate. No Surprises at the ending but believable.
1,"Atrocious, primary-school pulp.","I'd heard that Patterson was a bad writer, but I wasn't prepared for the true impact of his shoddy, grade-school prose. The story is plodding, kept alive only by single-word paragraphs and two-page chapters. The line-by-line writing is juvenile and the story developments - such as a split-personality killer being hypnotised in court - feels more like a parody of a psychological thriller than a NYT best seller. Avoid."
3,J,"It was a fun read, but got long winded in parts. I will be reading another Alex Cross book soon though."
4,Awesome start to the series,"I blazed through the last 180 pages of this novel. It was awesome. The action kept up even when the chapters changed. I thought that with the short chapters which depicted a scene change would make the book ""herky-jerky"" but that was far from the truth. What did end up happening is the action was swift and gigantic in its brashness. I am currently on ""Kiss The Girls"" which I won't speak of here but when I'm done I will give my take on it."
4,"Along Came a Spider, by James Patterson","This book was a chilling suspense thriller. I think that it is unique that the author tied in so much history to the kidnapping and the murders. Everything was related to something else. Some of the interesting events that happened in the book was that the kidnapper was also the one committing all the other murders while he was hiding from the police. Another interesting point is the depth the author went into with the psychoanalysis of Detective Alex Cross and the author used Cross to psycho-analyize the kidnapper. I recommed this book to everyone. It is 504 pages, but a fast read. It ties in all genres to one book, but if you aren't a fan of a little gore, this one is not for you."
3,Another swell Patterson,"Once again a nice story starring Alex Cross. His marvelous style and heroics make this a good read. The villan or villans change as the story moves on. His remarkable relationship with his family and partner shine through as usual. Not many lulls in this story, made for an overall good book. I look forward to the others I haven't read yet."
1,Patterson--the master of dumbing down prose,"I truly believe that Patterson believes three-fourths of the world (if not more) is illiterate. This book irritated the hell out of me. For goodness sakes, I am a sentient, intelligent person who can structure a sentence and appreciate a good phrase.What is this regurgitated madness? Yada, yada, yada.Stop pandering for the sake of a buck. One word to the reader: NEXT!!!Smooches!"
1,Useless Junk,My wife got this at work for her 5 year anniversary as well. I regret asking her to get it. I've used dozens of telescopes and could never get this one to work at all and I do mean at all. I put it in the closet for a few years. My child is asking for one so I pulled it out. One knob was broken off. Still couldn't get anything to work and in less than 5 minutes another knob fell off. I'm never buying any Bushnell product again.
1,"Kids, don't look!!!","Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen."
1,Platform style kills yet again,"I was so hyped about this game so I decided to rent it and see if it would be worth the $60 they are asking for it. What I got was an overrated game whose most challenging aspect is jumping from platform to platform and doing mini quests that take forever to master yet are not worth the time. The outlandish cursing and behavior of conker is entertaining at first but gets old really fast when you have to go around in circles because the camera angles will not let you see good enough to jump from point A to point B. Even the cute rude squirrel isn't enough to get a person past that! The camera angles are terrible and there are no ways to move them around for a better position. Some platform games are known to have that and make it a little better. Until they can make a platform game that has better manuverability and better camera angles I suggest avoiding them like the plague. Bad fur day? Bad everything in general! Sorry conker, best stay at the bar and remain drunk."
1,I HATE THIS GAME,"I saw this game one day and I said, ""what did they do to conker!?...?"". I was so mad I didn't know what to do. I was really upset. Conker was such a cute squirrel and so nice looking and friendly until they made Conkers bad fur day.This game is a very bad game, and I don't think any kid no matter what age should paly this game, even if you are a hundred years old. This game is nothing but bad violence! This game also has other bad things I will not mention. I Think this game should be banned from the public. And I hope if you are smart you will listen to me."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This game is so, so NASTY! Everything is sick and gory! A do not buy! I hate it! I hate it!"
1,"Worst Game for Nintendo 64, besides Donkey Kong","Do not purchase this game. I have a good gaming sense of humor, but this is just [bad]. Why this game even came out i don't know...Don't even consider this game. Its gameplay is horrible, the camera skips, and its just stupid"
5,Greatest Game Ever!!!,"This is above all the king of video games in my opinion, even better than Wolfenstein, Silent Hill 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. This game is one of the funniest games of all time as well since it has some of the best phrases I've ever heard. The only downside is the bleeps and the fact that that hot cavewomen never exposed herself (sorry if that offends anybody). The fact that a talking squirrel is in this is f***ing retarded, but this game is so good that it actually makes that a plus (hate those damn squirrles). I love this game, every level offers something, new...in fact the only remaining factor for each level (even Spooky) is the comedy and above all the violence! The multiplayer is amazing as well, the only downside is that theres no brass knuckles or a revolver, but there are many plusses like a katana, magnum, shotgun and especially the chainsaw (AWESOME!!!). Buy this game, even if you dont prefer profanity or violence."
5,This is a great game,"THe humor in this game is great. The multiplayer is the best multiplayer in any game i have ever played,I love killing evil teddie bears"
5,Where can I get one in the year of 2005,"I have rented this game out before and I loved it but a few years later I wanted to buy it but have no idea where I can get one by the way I need a store in canada ontario if you know of a store which still sells Nintendo64 games and one of them is Conker's Bad Fur Day please send me a e-mail telling me the name of a store in which has the characteristics above.

4,Conkers.....The Perfect Teens Game,"Conkers Bad Fur Day has an amazing way of getting yourself stuck to the tv screen. This game allows you to search, fight, get grossed out, and have a fun time. Conkers Bad Fur Day is packed with a big adventures and multiplayers games. You can fire at tanks in war mode, or fight freedom in player mode. This is game is the best you can buy this year."
5,Best game for N64!,"If anybody says that this game [is bad] they should be shot.Having said that, this is the greatest game ever, if not for n64.The story mode is funnyer than ...(they do that in the game).As the game progresses, it gets funnyer.The war part is soooo cool.I wont tell you any more, dont want to give it away.The multiplayer mode is really ...cool!Besides the blody warfare, trying to kill the computer can be challenging.The AI is better than ALL the games i have played for the N64.After beating the game a year ago, I still play it all the time.All in all, this is an easy buy.Diffinetly get this game."
3,THE MOST HILARIOUS AND BEST GAME EVER MADE!!!,"I played this game when it first came out and i immediately loved it!! i love CBFD!!!!! i just love it more than anything in the world!! more than my family!!!!! i will be a big idiot if they never made CBFD, so listen everybody....Nobody!!! and i mean Nobody!!! will EVER love CBFD as much as i do!!!!!!!! NEVER!!!! so if u think u love it more than me, u dont know how obsessed i am with it!!!! i have nearly 3 CBFD!!!! and 2 nintendo 64 systems!!!! all for my CBFD to last 4 life!!!!!! the only game that means the most 2 me!!! so i highly recommend it!! its great!!!!!! I conker's bad fur day this much (this line NEVER ends)))*******"
2,"fun idea, but....","I liked the idea of a adult themed game for the Nintendo platform. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired (especially from a well-respected house like Rare). The cut scenes are fine, and most of the controls are intuitive. But I found that the lack of a decent camera ruins the game. Usually you can't see what is happening around you, and the camera moves during crucial game maneuvers. Just a poorly coded camera routine."
5,Conker's Bad Fur Day,"Campaign is alright, its a lot of videos. Multiplayer is by far the best asset of this game. Probably my favorite multiplayer game for n64 other than smash bros."
4,"Conker is good, but there are some flaws...","Let's start out by saying this game should be rated ""I"" for immature, not ""M"" for mature. It's rude, it's crude, and it's pretty much all toilet humor. Outside of all that, it's a great game though. The graphics are amazing; there were points were it looked like a Dreamcast game! And the sound is equally good. The voice-overs are spot on and the characters actually move their mouths in sync with the words!(A first for N64 games I believe)The only problem lies in the control and camera angle. You will swear more that Conker does, I guarantee, due to the fact that he moves more at the speed of a water buffalo than a squirrel. This makes the game INSANELY DIFFICULT at times. But all inall, you'll forget about it after awhile and just enjoy the game. (Especially the Gregg Grim Reaper parts! They're the funniest thing I've ever seen in a game!) Buy it now, if you don't mind a few flaws in your gems."
4,THE BEST,"This is the best from Nintendo 64,it has some South Park-like humor that delves in bad taste,crudeness,and offensive jokes.it stars Conker a small squirrel that has different levels to kill and do mission for the bad characters.The best level is Color's War where Conker has to kill Teddy Bears.One of the best with some crude stuff like when Conker pees on demons,throws corn nuggets at a opera ...,and when a fat bat turns Conker into a bat and Conker eats to much chocolate and poops on zombies.This is Mature stuff but kids over 13 will like it."
3,TAKE A DIVE!! THIS GAME SINKS LIKE A STONE!,"All the humor is this game might be amusing if not for the gawd-awful controls. Even after Conker sobers up, he still acts like he's drunk -- just like the developers. Thanks a lot, Rare!! You ruined my life!!Seriously though, I don't remember the controls being this bad, so maybe my controller's busted.The game opens with a tribute to Wendy Carlos' Clockwork Orange theme song and Conker sitting in a throne, about to explain how he became king of the land. ""It was a bad fur day."" Next thing you know, Conker's in a bar leaving a message on Berri's answering machine. Berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink two-piece. The control-response starts out really bad because Conker is drunk stupid. Then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant. From there on, things just seem to get weirder. Rare wanted to make a fairy tale parody with sick humor, and that's exactly what they did."
5,Fantastic,"Classic game! Very fun to play, hilarious dialogue, a true classic. Game is in good shape, plays perfectly. Very satisfied."
5,The Hangover [Squirrel Edition],"This game is context sensitive (sensitive to context). If you like shooting rodents in the head with sniper guns, blowing teddies to smithereens, and getting drunk to pee on people, this is the perfect game for you. They also have a pretty cool techno song in the Rock Solid club. Ting!"
5,da best,Naturally i dont like creature games but this one got my attention and kept it. Who knew a squrrel vs. teddiz war would be so addicting. With a wide variety of guns and game types this has great multiplayer and single player game modes. Well to finish up it kept the title da best.
3,Halex Ping Pong Set,The net looks and works great. But the material started peeling off the paddles after being used only once or twice! We had to glue them back and now they are working fine.
2,Quality questionable,"I have to say that the product is functional, but the material used for the brackets is so weak that it bends as you try to fasten it to the table. The net is fine."
5,Excellent value,Perfect for those families who need a basic table-tennis set to augment the dining-room table. Exactly as advertised.
3,Net ripped a little,"The net was ripped a little at the seam, but for this price, I don't mind. The net post was a little hard to put on the table since there were no instructions, but after about 20 minutes, it's up and somewhat stable. Again, for this price, I can't really complain too much."
4,Terrific,"Fantastic for anyone who's loved one is in prison for them to understand things better. I realize that this takes place many years ago, but some things could be the same way today depending on where your loved one is. I do hear that the coffee is still awful."
3,What About the Victims?,Mr.Osborne shows a great deal of compassion for the inmates of this prison. It is also very interesting how he puts himself in their place for a week. I couldn't help thinking though about the original reasons why they were in the prison. These men committed serious crimes that involved victims. This was not addressed. I felt this was too lopsided and didn't finish the book.
5,Reconcilable Differences,Exellent Book! This author offers alternative solutions to a very difficult situation. I appreciated his always pointing couples back to the biblical standards of marriage. This book actually offered much hope and a great resource for those interested in the reconciliation process.
4,Skaters talk from the heart,A interesting book that allows the skaters to comment without interruption. The book is a series of comments from almost any skater you have heard of on almost any skating subject you can think of. An interesting and enjoyable read.
3,tediously written,"This book is assigned in one of my classes and it is simply excruciating to read. Bondeson manages to kill subjects for me that I had been excited to read about (Mary Toft & spontaneous human combustion, for example). If you enjoy superfluous detail, tedium, and a moralizing tone (or can withstand them because you're very, very interested in physical human anomaly),then consider this book. I, however, have two more chapters read for my final, and well--just kill me now."
3,Well researched but a difficult read at times,"The book is very well researched, however , it is not something you can sit in your armchair and enjoy reading. There is a lot of minute detail , particularly with names and dates.I was expecting more discussion about the medical side of things, but most was a historical account of events. Eventually I had to skip a few of the chapters that did not seem interesting."
3,A Cabinet Of Medical Curiosities,"""A Cabinet Of Medical Curiosities"" is an interesting book. I expected better photos, not hand drawings."
5,Everyone trying to do Small Group ministry should read this.,"It's refreshing, insightful, and helpful. I especially appreciated Ted's advice about not just overlaying some other church's small group ministry onto your church, but rather praying, wrestling, and struggling with what God wants at your church.What he's saying make a lot of sense, especially in our American free enterprise culture."
3,"The author's caught on to half of it, that's for sure!","Haggard actually got half of it right... people enjoy affinity groups, and they're a great place to connect with unchurched people and build relationships.However, his definition of a ""cell group"" is weak and he lumps all the various kinds of affinity groups in that definition.Healthy cell groups are holistic, meaning they contain the lifestyle commanded in both the Great Commandment and Great Commission. They are also Christ-centered, and do not find their purpose in snowboarding or scrapbooking.However, I firmly believe that what Haggard has written about in this book should be employed by holistic small group-based churches as a relationally evangelistic arm of each group in addition to a true, Christ-in-the-midst gathering of believers.Man cannot live on interest groups (bread) alone."
1,Bait and Switch,"Despite this book's title, the author provides no useful information regarding the art of angling with flies, and readers seeking advice on fishing the waters of Colorado, where the author lives, should look elsewhere."
5,NOT JUST FOR TEENAGERS,"A pastor has a teenaged girl - the author - in this office for discussion of problems in her life, with the understanding (pretext!) that she will arrange and rearrange his library - by color, by size, and so on. Each episode is short - perhaps four or five pages long - and the resolutions are pretty straightforward. The end of the book tells ""the rest of the story"" on the real-life pastor.The biggest mistake anyone thinking of buying this book can make is to assume it is only for those in the snares of adolescence. I am a 62 year-old physician and have read the book for insight at least twice."
2,What The..??,I like John L and think he's a great actor but this movie wasn't up to his level.It started out real good almost like a documentary where he's talkng about life on the streets and what its all about. MONEY! The end was stupid...The trailer fooled me into believing it ws a bigger story than it was. Dry and weak.
4,It's dat gangsta gangsta gangsta s***,Perfect gangsta movie. Typical gangsta get out of crime movie but I like that kind of stuff. Great underground movie. Realistic characters.
3,watch the first 45 minutes or so,"and then turn the dern thing off! there are the obvious paralells to carlito's way, but without the skill in the monologue. the dialogue in the movie is terrible. the characters are not even remotely interesting, and i think it was actually kind of funny that la columbiana's assassin/brother kept showing up to kill people. he just needed to start whistling of something and then the movie would have been worth a laugh at least. it seems like someone had a good idea for the beginning of a movie, then sold the script off to someone else to finish it.i gave it three stars because the beginning of the movie was pretty good, everyone likes a coming of age story. the ending was alright, but the majority of the movie that it had to reflect back on was pretty horrible."
4,one of John Leguizamo's best movies,"John Leguizamo gives one of his best preformences next to Romeo and juilet. i found the movie overall to have a decent plot with decent actors. the overall movie was good with some action every once in a while.this is a movie to buy but if you dont like a slow movie, then dont get this one."
3,Nothing Special,"Again, I'll have to agree with the critics on this one. EMPIRE has the right idea and it starts off well, but it never follows through.The movie is slow-moving in some places, but rushed in most others. The characters are pretty well developed, but they aren't allowed to live up to their full potential. This movie could have been so much more. A SCARFACE for the new millenium. But the producers either ran out of money or someone decided to change from a crime drama to crime thriller mid-stream.In general, it has a moderate amount of blood and violence, that's more or less well-placed and not excessive. Some of the deleted scenes should have been left in. It would have made for a more interesting movie.OVERALL, it's not a bad movie, but it's nothing special either. If channel surfing on a rainy Sunday afternoon and I see it on cable, I wouldn't turn away. But I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again either."
4,i liked this movie,i liked this movie. its sort of like scarface. but its definately worth renting. i'm glad i saw it.
3,[Similar to] Carlito's Way,"Empire is an o.k. movie but not one I'd want to see again. It is [like]Carlito's Way which is far and away a better movie starring Al Pacino. The similarites between the two are many, including the ethinicity of the character, trying to get out of the game, and the ending of the movie. If you want to see a really good movie on this subject see Carlito's Way, if you want to see Fat Joe ... see this."
1,You judge a man by what he respects,"You judge a man by what he respects or disrespects. John Leguizamo, who would be otherwise marked as a brilliant talent has chosen to denigrate the best and brightest."
3,Did you see it coming? I certainly did...,"....terrifically underrated latin actor Johnny Legs shows his acting chops in this Drug Dealer drama. Rappers Fat Joe and Treach add to the street flavor. Classic beauties Isabella Rossellini and Sonia Braga add to the exotica. The plot however really thins out when you realize Legs' character has given this hot shot investor over 3 million in cash in a suitcase...now, what would you do with alla that dough? That's right. The boy and his girl (the ueber babe/semi-actress Denise Sheen...uh...Richards) skips off to South Beach. Not too far from the Versace Mansion. From there it gets messier. What else is wrong with the film? 'Empire', the title. It leads one to believe the protagonist is gonna be so high up the ladder that he's a mover and shaker.....not a street thug. In fact, the only regal person worth of the title was the Rossellini character. Other than that, it's an alright show."
2,Leguizamo keeps the empty Empire from crumbling,"John Leguizamo (George A. Romero's Land Of The Dead, The Honeymooners) plays a hotshot street thug from the South of Bronx who winds up making a business deal with wallstreet hotshot, played by Peter Sarsgaard (the upcoming The Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Soon, Leguizamo's life turns upside down as he finds out that his business partner is trying to scam him. This is a very intriguing story but it leaves nothing to fill in the gaps except for a good performance by John Leguizamo which keeps this from going down in the dumps. Also starring Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enought, Valentine) as another ditzy woman with sexual ways, Rappers Fat Joe and Treach (Jason's Lyric), Nestor Serrano (The Negotiator) and a weird role for Isabella Rosselini (Death Becomes Her, Immortal Beloved) as a druglord...very weird and the hair."
4,Great film,"""Mujeres Infieles"" is a really good movie. The movie is full of tender, surprising and insightful moments. It strives to be truthful and honest and it accomplishes what it is trying to be. The movie is about couples who are dealing with the infidelity of the woman, a subject rarely explored in films (or anywhere else for that matter). The beginning of the film explores the infidelity as a sort of liberation from the daily routine, an unsatisfying marriage, feeling unloved and undervalued, and a seemingly perfect life. The movie is not only believable, but also understanding and knowledgeable about the issue of infidelity. I really liked the movie."
2,Interesting,"The combination of a German and an Irish family following the war is interesting, but the way the author tells it makes it so obtuse that at times you wonder if it is fantasy. He missed a great chance to relate more of what was going on around them so you could see the family in relation to ""normal.""A strange childhood is not uncommon, so if the author had been more direct about the unusual behavior of his father and his mother's complicity, it would have been more easily digested. The characters were never really developed; they just muddled through scenes, so you never got to know them or cared about them.In some ways it is comparable to The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society in its relating of the atmosphere. You get the idea, but you don't feel like you can relate to anyone who was there."
5,I couldn't put it down,"Memoirs are almost always interesting but this one is like nothing else I had ever read. Truly touching and endlessly interesting, this book has something for everyone. If you have ever felt like an ""outsider"" you will appreciate Hugo's plight. I couldn't stop reading it. It was a joy until the very last page."
5,wow!,"okay... this book is absolutely gorgeous - It is sweet,deep,and dark...an original story. it reads like a beautiful poem -i am so happy to read a new book by an author who writes so well... thank you, Hugo!"
3,Interesting Reading...But...,This book was interesting and informative... however I was disappointed because I was hoping for suggestions on sample menus and recipes.I wanted it to help me get the nutitional changes by body needs during pregnancy.The book tells you technically - nutrient by nutrient what you need... but I didn't find it to be translatable easily into my daily meal planning.
3,might be helpful to some,"I personally didn't find anything new in this book that I didn't know, however the book goes into some very detail info about food content itself, which I didn't find much helpful and actually boring at time, I kept skipping page by page. I was a healthy eater before pregnancy and when I got pregnant, it was not a big deal to find the information online and change few items in my diet here and there. However, I can see where it could be helpful to those who have different eating habits or want a real details."
1,NEVER GOT IT,"I paid for the book, but never received the book. I will never buy from this person again and I do not recommend you buying from them either. Unless of course you like giving your money away. It has been over a month since the purchase. I should have given seller no stars- I can't take the one back."
1,"Fluffy, cloying, and irritating","Two spirits are put into earthly forms on the Planet of Tears and become a high priestess and nobleman who must find their way to each other. Lots of new age clap-trap, flying pyramids, etc. No drama or plot to speak of. Emphatically skip this one."
4,Basic jiu jitsu for submission grappling,"This book is a good introduction to basic brazilian jiu jitsu as used in no-gi grappling. As usual, Kid Peligro does a fantastic job with the pictures and explanations of the various techniques."
2,"Does the advertised, but poorly","I had the same issues as the above reviewer. This performs bad in almost every aspect:1) Video: Reduces the quality of the image, also adding flickering;2) Keyboard: Doesn't recognize my G15 Gaming Keyboard... it works as a generic keyboard instead, no macros nor LCD;3) Mouse: Performs adequately here;4) Audio: It adds significant noise even at low volumes;My suggestion? Wait for the DVI KVMs to get cheaper."
1,This switch would not work and Dlink has no support for it...,"tried with 3 different keyboards but it would not work. I wasted all day just trying to get it to work. And I am not illiterate, I am an engineer. Called DLINK 6 times and wasted another 3 hours they could not and would not help me. Low priority item? Probably. No solutions? Likely. Try to buy Belkin or something else, save lots of hassle."
2,KVM,This USB KVM did not let my keyboard hotkeys (shortcuts) work through it.D-link support said it will not.
4,A challenge getting a single keyboard for 2 computers,"This is my third KVM switch for using a single keyboard and monitor for two or more computers. So far I am using two keyboards, but I may still get it down to a single keyboard, The monitor, as usual, works flawlessly. My first & 3rd were D_Link. I am staying with that brand. My second was to combine four computers by an off-brand manufacturer, which worked fairly well for only two months; then it expired. Stay with name brands and this does not seem to happen."
1,subtitles don't work,"As stated on the DVD jewel case, this movie is in Spanish only with English subtitles.I purchased it because I thought it would be a good way to learn Spanish.Try as I might, I was not able to access the subtitles. The setup menu shows the subtitle option, but the screen that comes up is inactive. Like a dead link. No matter how you click, you can't access subtitles.Without subtitles as reference, it is near impossible to understand any word as the native speakers reel off dialogue."
3,Good but not the Greatest,"I have always been a huge Janet fan. I have quite a few of her CD's, however, this is the 1st CD Single I have bought by Janet. I like tracks 1 & 4 the best. (Original Version & Masters @ Work Alternative Mix) The Teddy Riley Mix isn't all that bad either, BUT this would have been better, IF, the Timbaland/Missy Elliot remix would have been featured."
5,five stars 111111111111111111111111111111,i heard this version of janets remix and i really liked it. im going out tomorrow and buy it first thing !!!!!!! WAY TO GO JANET
3,Good but not best Janet,"Teddy Riley remixes are good, look forward to the domestic release in 1999. The Timbaland/Missy Elliot mix is the bomb!"
3,Hmmm..,"I bought the Go Deep single about 9 months ago, it is one of my favorite singles that was released from Janet's 97 Velvet Rope album. Although this single lacks a little, the only remix I really enjoyed was the Roni Size Remix, he rules! I am glad that he will be a part of Janet's next album. The other remixes are alright, but I guess buy this if you like collecting Janets singles."
1,Cheap quality software,"Please,do not waste your money on this software!! I bought it for 12.95, is not even worth 5 dollars. The quality and the functionality of this software is poor. I personally rate it a zero. If you want quality software do not buy this product."
1,Proventure a waste of money and time,"PLEASE DON'T ANYONE BUY THIS SOFTWARE, IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT. JUNK IS WHAT I CALL IT. NOT ANYTHING LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, NOW I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO BUY."
2,An idea that needs to be redesigned for various wart sizes,"After trying this out I realized that the size of the round medicated disc is much larger than the actual size of the wart on my finger, at least 50% larger in my case. This means that too much good skin that should be left alone is getting treated too. These strips are not made for the user to be able to adjust the size of the area being treated, so in my case it is not my best option. This would work better if the user could cut the round medicated disk to size first, or else be able to choose from a few different sizes of the medicated discs in each strip. Why not offer an assortment of sizes in one package? Now I have switched to using the fast acting gel instead."
3,Informatively Fair,Family memeber with diabetes currently came to reside within our household and not being sure of the disease we found this book a fair informative guideline to helping the family member with the control of their sugar and keep the other memebers lifes unchanged but helped us all eat healthier.
3,"Okay, but there are probably better titles","The information in the book was okay, but the exchange lists and diet information we formatted poorly and were a little simplistic. That was the main reason I bought the book so I was a little disappointed. On the other hand, it did contain some good basic info."
4,Paper Mario is Paper Fun,I would say that paper mario was the best rpg game ever. It combinds 2-d with 3-d. You can travle from Castles to islands and from deserts to winter wounderlands with 7 friends that will help you to beat Bowser. Also this is the first Mario game you can play as peach. These facts + so much more are what make Paper Mario the best RPG.
5,fun game,This is a very fun game. If you got mario 64 this will be a very good addition to your game library. Neat and unique graphics too. Unlike anything youve ever played
5,paper mario,"Paper mario was the best mario game i ever played it was very and i mean it,very fun i recommend it for you."
2,The original,"Lacks the polish of its predecessors but a great game in its own right. I originally bought this because people told me it was the same as Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars for SNES. It is NOT ANYTHING like that, but it is another enjoyable series in which I look forward to the next incarnation."
2,A good game but its just not worth it,"I rented this game and was glad I did. The gameplay, graphics, and characters are ok. The game script is not original, believe me. The graphics are reduced to a point to where you will think Mario 64 is better(And it is). I reccomend you just rent it, you can beat the game before you take it back."
5,My 6 yr old and 9yr old girl and boy love this game!,"They can't get enough, I had to buy a second one because they use it too much to share!"
5,Mario Charm,"I loved this game. I do not have an N64 anymore, but this was one of my favorite games when I had it. It has a world of everything mario that fans will enjoy. It has a unique battle system that made timing a key to winning. You must use strategy in your fights and make sure that you have sufficient help to get through the battles. You must also master the moves of the friends that Mario gains along his journey. This game is not just for kids, the paper look takes away the ""fuzzy"" look that most 3D N64 games have. It does have bright levels, but i liked it and it made me kind of happy. This is a must for Mario fans, or for anyone with an N64!"
5,Very fun game,"Paper Mario is a fun game because it's got great battles, a good storyline, and a lot of replay value. The graphics and sound fit the game well. Mario gets a variety of Partners that help him on his adventure. There are a lot of secrets to find inthis game too. I rate this game 93/100."
5,Be prepared for a commitment,"I picked up Paper Mario at the beginning of the summer because I was bored, and looking for a good video game to play. I got exactly what I was looking for - an engaging game that took about 25 hours to complete and that I literally couldn't put down sometimes. If you have school obligations or other huge responsibilities in your life, I seriously wouldn't recommend this because you will spend a few days constantly engrossed in the Paper Mario world.If you played Super Mario RPG, you will know exactly what to expect - the structure and gameplay are both very similar to the Super Nintendo game, albeit improved greatly. The battle system is unique and the pacing is perfectly timed. For any fan of RPGs (or of Mario games) this is a great one."
3,"Adequate, but less than impressive.","This edition in a long line of Mario adventures is fairly entertaining. The sounds and scenes are fun if nothing else, and there are several fairly interesting characters. While the gameplay is simple, it is not fast paced. Moreover, the battles tend to get tedious, and overall the game seemed to be lacking in challenge. This may be the perfect game with which to fight away a few hours of boredom on a rainy Saturday, but don't expect anything innovative."
3,"Fun to play, but too easy.","The game was fun and entertaining, but I thought it was too easy......much easier than SuperMario64. I finished it in only a few days. It was a bit of a let-down after all the hype I've been reading about it and the money I spent on it. I would recommend Conker's Bad Fur Day if you want a good game (it is crude, though, so parents beware)."
1,It Stinks like dead skunks!,"Ok, first of all, graphics? they're horrible, sound? nope, music? well i guess if you like listening to a music box for hours on end. The whole 2-d in a 3D world is just plain garbage. It's an excuse for horrible horrible graphics. Nintendo is a piece of cr@p company now. How dare they call this Mario RPG 2? Mario Rpg was made by SQUARESOFT, and if nintendo hadn't made so many stupid decisions(the n64 not using CD's ) squaresoft would still be working for them, and the n64 wouldn't be so childish and terrible. Mario had his day, and he should've been retired after mario kart 64, so he could keep some dignity."
1,This GAme Stinks,"Ok I bought this game for my lil brother, and u know what it stinks bad. There are too much talking and not enough action and adventure. Besides he doesn't know how to read, he's only 5. I thought this game is similar to Kirby and Yoshi. But I guess I was wrong. Not only is it boring, it is absolutely & ridiculously hard to play. My lil bro was bored with this game like after 15 minutes he played it. What a waste of money. Don't buy this game. Here's a quote from my 5 years old brother Aaron ""This game is NO FUN"". So don't buy it."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!,One of the best games I have ever played! You have to battle all different kinds of villians and collect star spirits that teach you new moves.
4,Paper Mario...,"Paper Mario is a very fun game. Although it is easy to beat and addictive, I would recommend it. With 7 companions,( You will need the help of each one,VERY much,) Mario sets out on a new adventure to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil clutches. (notice a pattern?)Overall, this game is one of the best I've ever played."
5,Not Another Boring Video Game--This One Is Fun!,"We have rented this game at least a hundred times for my 5 yr old son, & he's definitely not tired of it or bored w/it! I'm buying it for him for Christmas so I can save the rental fees! This game has a good bit of reading (but it's fun to sit & play the game & read the ""story-line"" w/him). However, once he got used to it he knew which character had important things to say & which did not so he's playing on his own a lot, too. It inspires ""forward-thinking"" because Mario has to accomplish certain goals before he can obtain the rewards. Our entire family gets into it when he's playing! Highly reccommend to N-64 buffs...old & young alike!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Worst sequel ever. If you dare to call it sequel at all, that is. It lacks challenge and is horrible; besides, the controls are restricting. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS; IT'S NOT WORTH IT."
5,Best Game EVER!,This is a good game to get for N64. If you like Mario games and like RPG games then this game is the best. The way you fight enemies is really cool especially with timed attacks and the action command. The only downside is that you only get 30 BP so you can't have a lot of badges and all those other cool attacks. Overall I would rate this game:10/10 Graphics 100000000000000000000000000/10 for paper graphics8/10 Difficulty9.5/10 Gameplay9.9/10 OverallBased on this I would think this game as a good game to get. But still if you have Gamecube get Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door!! :D
5,Awesome!,"This is the second in the series of Mario games and without doubt the better of the two. Quite simply, the entire gaming experience can be summed up with one single word - AWESOME!"
4,Game works,This is collectors game. Fun for all ages. Game works fine but case was dirty like soda residue or someting.
5,this is totally.....,AWESOME!!!! it brings back good memories. and im proud to say it was equally as fun as when i first played it. thank you so much! rock on gamers!!!
5,It's good,"The game looks like it's for little kids, but don't let it's Yoshi's Story aesthetic lead you into thinking that PM is just for short stuffs. Sure the game is very easy, but it manages to provide sastifying fun almost every step of the way. If you've ever been a fan of Mario, PM will deliver the kind of fun you expect from him. Marioesque touches fill the game from it's worlds of Koopas and Toads to invisible blocks and panels that you must punch or hammer to cover the secert power-ups. Even the RPG system of battling maintains the Mario feel by letting you interact in the turn-based battles(a well timed controller tap will determine the strength of your attack/defense.) Surprisingly, PM is only the 2nd true sequel of Mario on theN64. It may be flat, but it never falls flat. Classic Mario all the way."
3,A Failed RPG...,"Sequels can be very corruptive. Paper Mario was partially supposed to be a sequel to the SNES Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. I was deeply disappointed with Paper Mario. It certainly would be a bad choice for the RPG-fans or even Super Mario RPG fans... Yes, the graphics are very well-done(no angular graphics this time!) but the game play is quite too short. It took me less than a month to beat it. And... Those people got to come up with better ideas than just ""Save the Princess from Bowser for the 99th time"". That story is getting VERY old. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to any RPG-lovers. It's such a shallow role-playing game. However, Paper Mario may be appealing to younger players. Otherwise, I suggest you rent Paper Mario and beat it in 3 days. It's quite possible."
5,Well worth it!,"Nintendo saw the direction that games were going...3-D characters in a relatively 2-D world...and spun it on its head. It worked.The game is full of funny moments, strategy, and guaranteed Mario Brothers success. Do those crazy Italians ever really fail to deliver?"
3,!The cool game is here!,I will give it a 5 because it is too awesome. I can't stop playing it. I am almost done with the game. It's so cool when you go in the Koopa Bros. Fortress. That's all I'm Telling ya. Now I am going to play it right now.
3,S'up WAY TOO EASY,"S'upThis game was one of the most boring games ever. Okay so it kept me aware enough so that I would try to beat it but you never had to take your time, all of the bosses were almost impossible to lose to, most of the characters were never used and I beat the game within a week. If you want a good RPG don't get this unless you like to beat games instead of enjoying there graphics (this game had almost none). The story line was just like every other Mario game every rescue the princess. Just get another game unless you love Mario or you don't have enough money. Or you can just rent the game for a couple of days and beat it."
1,Complaints to the seller,"This is not a review of a game. After going through the multiple steps required to order a product, we find that the seller(Swank @home) will not ship to Canada. Could this information not be made clear before a person goes to all the trouble of placing an order, getting a password etc., only to meet with disappointment at the end of the process?"
1,What happened?,"The original Super Mario RPG was a wonderful game! It was a WONDERFUL game. Why couldn't Nintendo have just done the same thing they did in that game, only with better graphics and a different story line? This game can hardly be called a sequel - it is rather a laughable farce."
1,Not Surprising,"For some strange reason I am not surprised to see that Nintendo has produced another game that isn't worth the money it took to make. Paper Mario is one horrible excuse for a game on any level. The Mario story is already dying(or already dead), the game's graphics are horrible, and the controls are restricting. These are just a few of the MANY problems with the game. I don't know what to make of this(not the game). It seems that Nintendo has come out with quite an extensive trend of incredibly stupid games. So please if given the choice of Paper Mario or any other recent games for Nintendo64 it isn't worth the money, the trouble of playing it, or the trouble of trying to get rid of it."
2,"History, Not Basketball","I found this DVD dull. I had expected to see actual games, not just snippets of a great shot or great dribbling here and there. This DVD spends way too much time showing people remembering the GlobeTrotters and not enough time showing actual play (and beloved Globetrotter antics).Very disappointing (unless you are a history buff)."
2,Thumbs down.......Where's the showmanship they are known for???,"I was disappointed this DVD shows hardly any of the tricks that they are known for. I had to go to you-tube to show my son what I was talking about. When I was a child I remember seeing them on TV performing.They were so funny and impossibly talented !!I actually didn't know the history of them so I guess that was nice, but without showing them perform it's pretty useless. I wouldn't recommend buying it, I would just go to You-Tube and watch."
2,harlem globetrotters- the team that changed the world,thought it would have more of their playing skills.....it was more of a racist movie ! wasn't what i thought !
3,Does not play on all DVD machines,"Does not play on all DVD player machines, Samsung Combo DVD/VCR.Does not play on all DVD player machines, Samsung Combo DVD/VCR."
2,Does not last.,It does not last long on your lips. I expected better quality for a more expensive product. I will not buy it again.
1,Don't Bother,"This movie is really bad. Fans of Marie should avoid this one. No great shots of her and the dialog is really stupid. She is a sexy woman, but you won't find it here Too much action and not enough story line or drama. Avoid it. No wonder it never made it to DVD"
5,It's a cat's life,"Enticed by the wonderful Dave McKean illustrations, I bought this even though it's a children's book. I love it! ""Varjak Paw"" is one of those crossover works which is sure to be a hit with young and old. I sense a cult classic in-the-making here. My only criticism is, I felt the ending was ever so slightly anti-climactic. Nevertheless, it's thought-provoking and highly imaginative, boasting a rich array of characters; some endearing, some scary - all memorable. It's also original, even if the 'hero having to learn and grow to find himself' theme is not. This book will stand up to repeat readings, which is important for young readers. You don't have to like cats to enjoy it, though you may look at them in a different way after reading ""Varjak Paw"".What I would love now? For Pixar Productions, the makers of 'Finding Nemo', to make ""Varjak"" into a fabulous film."
5,A Great Read Aloud for the Whole Family,"I enjoyed reading this book to my then 5 and 9 year-olds. Both my daughter and son loved the characters and their experiences. We can all benefit by heeding the lessons that Varjak learns as he faces his various challenges. Don't miss the sequel, the Outlaw Varjak Paw. The kids are writing to the author to ask him to write a third book. I hope he does."
4,Varjak Paw review,"Do you like cats? I do! Cats can be comical and smart and are VERY cool. I have a great book for cat lovers. It is a book called Varjak Paw written by SF Said. It is about a cat named Varjak who has lived in a nice house all his life. When there old owner dies a strange man with two creepy cats comes to live in the house. Though Varjek trys to convence his family the man and his cats are up to no good, they ignore the poor cat. When things get bad, Varjek leaves the house and goes into the city to try and unravle the mystery.It is a very good...but short book. It is 255 pages hardback but most pages have pictures on them. It is a great book and has a sequal coming out in 2006.If you liked VARJAK PAW you might like...-The Warriors books -BY ERIN HUNTER-The Warriors: the New Prophecy books -BY ERIN HUNTER-Cry of the Icemark -BY STUART HILLA book reviw by BOOKWORMEN"
4,About Varjak Paw,"The only thing that would have made the book better for me was if the ending of the book had more details, because to me it was kind of dull. The rest of the book was fantastic. It was like a cord leading you from the beginning to the end. While reading the book I felt like Varjak(protagonist)was sitting right there next to me. Sometimes when Varjak got into fights with other cats I could almost feel his pain. The antagonist's personality was awesome, evil but sort of friendly all at the same time. I liked how not only the protagonist and antagonist, but all the characters seemed so realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes cats and loves a book that makes you wonder what's going to happen in every chapter. Also, if you have read other books by S F Said, then this is the book for you."
4,A solid start for the series,"My 10-year-old daugther enjoyed this book, reading it after reading The Outlaw Varjak Paw. But she did not enjoy this one as much as the sequel. While this was exciting it was also more creepy and sad, saying she felt sorry for the cats who were killed by the evil character, and she wasn't interested in rereading it anytime soon. Probably would have been a better read for her if she had not been as empathic.After reading both books however, she said she's hoping more will be written in this series."
4,"Very informative, easy to understand",I read this book for my first organic chemistry course.I found it very helpful and i still refere to it at times.I specially find the chapeter about SN1 and SN2 reactions very useful because i tried couple of the other books before reading this one.
3,"""Fictionalized"" documentary","The 3 hour movie was okay. The screenplay centers around a single family. I suppose to provide a cohesive storyline rather than short segments of the lives of many people. Many occurences referenced in the book of the same name are portrayed; although, I don't believe the movie quite conveys the impact that the explosion had upon Halifax and its citizens. In an effort to provide a more ""feel good"" ending, one character is depicted as being within 200 yards of the ship and out in the open when it exploded and yet only sustained minor facial cuts."
5,Great movie about the best city in the world.,"Fantastic Movie. Very well done Salter Street.I actually ran into the actors while they were filming (I was a block away from the set at a convenience store), but didn't know it was for this movie until I saw it."
3,SHATTERED CITY,THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS VIDEO WAS ALL THE PREVIEWS AT THE BEGINNING....AND I COULDN'T SKIP RIGHT TO THE MOVIE.IT WAS WELL DONE AND THE FACTS WERE ACURATE BUT THERE WAS QUITE ALOT OF FANTASY. HOWEVER IT PROBABLY MADE FOR A BETTER STORY.
5,Back To The Future,"Sir Albert Howard certainly did not mince words nor did he dance around the subject of the destruction of soil fertility by modern farming techniques. The very first sentence of chapter one sets the tenor for the entire book, ""The maintenance of the fertility of the soil is the first condition of any permanent system of agriculture."" He accurately depicts the soil as being the Earth's `capital' and upon reflection one would come to agree that all of mankind's wealth have originated from the soil. In the same regard I will have to state the Earth's future population and prosperity (or lack thereof) will be determined by whether or not we can regain the courage to recognize and act on the eternal truth of Nature."
5,organic soil,"I have not yet finished this little ""big"" book of info however it is a ""must read' if you are serious about growing organic and taking care of your soil."
2,not much of a guide,"If you are looking for a GUIDE for the Heidelberg Catechism, this is NOT the book to buy. You should go with the commentary by Ursinus who is one of the authors of the catechsim. The Ursinus book, however, comes with a bit of warning: it is very very comprehensive and difficult to read. The chapter on sin alone exceeds 10 pages (font 7ish).In the student guild by G.I. Williamson, the author often rambles on and on to make a rather insignificant point. Just borrow the book from a pastor if you wish to skim through the catechism."
1,0 Stars,"I bought the Alexander sweatshirt. The quality is substandard. The shoulders are off and the product is basically irregular! Although the company's statement shows that they accept returns and exchanges, after I received the item, I discovered that they do not either exchange or return because the item is considered a personal item (despite the fact that they have these items in stock)."
4,very good,"Los he estado usando regularmente y hasta ahora han funcionado bien, no conocía esta marca, me ha sorprendido. La recomiendo ampliamente para un uso regular."
2,great when it works. it'll break fast though.,"The Robo Kleen works great *when* it works. Every time I use it or every other time I use it, I find myself having to pull it away from the wall part way through a cleaning session because it runs into the wall and stays there or climbs it's front end up the wall so that only the back wheels remain on the floor. Also several times found it had mysteriously floated up to the surface of the pool. I used the Robo-Kleen for 1 month during last year's season and 4 months during this season before the motor stopped functioning. And now it is out of the warranty period."
2,Was happy until...,"It worked great for the first season and I was extremely happy that I bought it. I hate cleaning the pool so the fact that I could drop this in and let it do its magic was to me, well..., magic. Per the instructions I put the unit in storage this past winter and just re-opened my pool a couple weeks ago to find that my robotic pool-sucking friend lost all of its powers. It seems not only to have lost its suction power but it also doesn't move around the pool as gracefully as it did last season. I made sure there wasn't anything clogging the propeller (there wasn't) - beyond that I can only hypothesis that there was some internal malfunction. The warranty expired so now I am grappling with the prospect of purchasing another robot or going back to the manual method. Because of its lack of durability I can only give this product 2 stars."
1,Robo-Kleen Robotic Cleaner,"I purchased this upon the recommendation of the Leslie's pool employee. It worked well for ~ 2 weeks, whereupon it just stopped. I returned it to the manufacturer and they sent a replacement. The replacement lasted all of three months before it too died. The motor just quit and the power box burned and melted the plug. The manufacturer would not replace it again.I replaced this last one with the cheaper ""bug""-type and it is working perfectly a year later.Save yourself time & money and forego this piece of junk."
1,Sux!,Read the reviews before you buy it - they almost all say that it works great for weeks then craps out! Don't waste your money!
2,"Cleans great, but no spareparts available","We loved how the Robo Kleen kept our pool clean. But after two years the internal gear broke. It is quite flimsy, so no surprise. I tried to locate spare parts on the internet. No luck. Called the manufacturer. They don't sell parts. They told me we could send the unit in and they would fix it. Estimated cost $140-$180. For a $3 part! A refurbished Robo Kleen is $220, so why bother!We tossed the Robo Kleen and will by a Polaris 65 or a Barracuda Zippy. At least we can get parts for these!"
1,Only lasted 2 years,I thought this product would last much longer. It worked great in the beginning but midway through the second season the drive wheels stopped working. Warrantee is only 1 year and you must save the receipt.
2,Robo-Kleen,"I purchased this cleaner 2 years ago and it worked great for the first year. The second year I had to have it repaired 2 times. I had a cleaner that worked off the pump but gave it away when I bought the Robo-Kleen because I was so impressed with it. It's now totally broken and I am now going back to those cleaners that work off the filter. They cost a lot less and don't break. Even if I had to replace it every 2 years (which I didn't), it would still be cheaper and less of a headache than the robo-kleen. I'm giving it 2 stars only because when it worked, it did do a good job. Other than that, it's certainly not worth the money."
1,book binding ripped open,"Hello Amazon. I am very upset at this order because the lower book binding area is torn quite a distance up the binding. I really would like a new book, and I need this book now for a report.Can you send me another book?Thank you."
3,Building blocks of a little-known faith,"I have been attending a Unitarian Universalist church for about a year. I was drawn to the church because of its openness. Unfortunately, the Unitarians are so fearful of evangelism that they almost refrain from giving newcomers any information about their faith in great detail. This book scratched the surface and then some. ""A Chosen Faith"" explains that two religious movements joined to created what is now the Unitarian Universalist movement. Now that I've read the book, I understand why Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Taoists, Pagans, Atheists and Agnostics all come together in UU fellowships. But more than that, the book attempts to explain what kind of theology can support such diversity under one tent. UUs have, I believe, a lot to say about how religious pluralism can be healthy and positive for our culture."
5,Halex 57300 3.0 4 Player Lightning Table Tennis Set,Good learner set.. took a few sec. to set up the net on my dining table (until i buy a professional pingpong table..)Surely a big bang for the buck..
3,haven't read it yet...,"The Today Show interview with the author, 1/19/00, revealed that all her proceeds from the book are being donated to charity."
4,"Hi, I'm Tom Servo. AHHHHHHHHHHH!","These people who are giveing this video bad reviews don't knowa work in progress when they see one! ........ says (quote) ""Season 1 is a work in progress"". Besides,it couldn't have been that bad for the show to get a second season. Unlike most other people, I found this early episode interesting to watch. I didn't find Josh Weinstein annoying in any way. The host segments are good (except for the second one) and the riffing is low but entertaining. At least the riffing isn't as bad as Shorts volume 1 (Shorts volume 1 being he worst MST3K tape available at the time).Favorite riff-Tom Servo: That isn't freezer wrap, that's a hand bag!"
1,Skip 'The Crawling Hand' unless you're a completist,"I picked this one up based on how much I've enjoyed every other MST3K videos I've seen, and thought that since this one was from the first season it could be kinda funny to see how the show looked in the begining.Well unfortunately, it wasn't.You can see the jokes (the few that there are) coming from a mile away, and they just don't have the same wit or hillarity (is that a word?) as the later movies do. And what was up with Servo...with that slow monotone voice, he reminded me of an old teacher I had in high school, and that isn't a good thing.So Unless you're a completist, I wouldn't bother picking up 'The Crawling Hand'. It has the distinction of being the only MST3K movie I've ever passed out while watching.I'd definately rather spend my money on Manos: The Hands of Fate, Eegah, or the Pod People (just to name a few)."
1,the first MST3K I ever saw...,"came from an era when I was barely out of training pants, and I thought ""The Crawling Hand"" was hilarious; the show, also, had a freshly original, B-show vibe unseen on television. Well, over a decade has passed since I saw this episode, and watching it recently I couldn't believe how primitive it seemed. As mentioned in other reviews, there are long pauses in between riffs, Tom Servo's voice could induce sleep, and the deliveries are toneless and lack enthusiasm. Save for a few moments (far and between), this is a truly painful experience, and that's coming from a FAN of the show."
2,Too many 'Hand' Puns...,"Overly thematic on the jokes, not enough pop-culture references as in later MST3K years...Just not as enjoyable as the other's I've seen. But you may want to get it just to see what MST3K was like in it's first season."
2,Sorry,"This is a very early episode of MST3K... And even though I knew that the first few seasons weren't very good, I bought it anyway. I did laugh alot... but I barely made it though the movie... It was interesting seeing the old set though. The host segments weren't too funny... The invention exchange wasn't very funny or interesting. The riffs were pretty funny, but they made too many jokes about hands and Gilligan's Island(since the actor that played the skipper is in The Crawling Hand). And as for Josh Weinstein... well, his voice just isn't very funny. And I like Frank!(who doesn't appear in this episode)... Ok, I think that I am done now. Overall, this episode IS good... it's just that I wish that I spent my $20 on an episode from a different season!"
2,What a waste of my money!,"I am a huge fan of this series and was shocked at how appallingly bad this episode was. Despite some good knocks during the movie, this was a waste of $ which I could have spent on something else (perhaps ""Catalina Caper"" or ""Wild World of Batwoman""). Being a veteran fan of the show, I read in the Episode Guide that the makers of the show wouldn't release any of the early episodes because they weren't up to the standards of their later work. How right they were. I should have listened to them, but unfortunately due to my curiosity, I wasted my hard-earned money, valuable time, and the makers of the show have irreversibly embarassed themselves. Let's hope that they redeem themselves with some excellent future video releases (a few more ""Shorts"" videos, please, hosted by Tom or Crow or Gypsy?)."
2,It hurts me to do this...,"... but I can only give this video two stars. I love MST3K to the deepest depths of my soul but even I found it hard to get through this episode from the Comedy Central years (Season One)... Dr. Larry Erhardt (TV Frank's predecessor) is annoying in the extreme and I wanted to fast-forward through most of the host segments with him in it. Even Joel seems a little lackluster in this one. Buy this ONLY if you are a die-hard fan of the show and want to complete your collection or you are just very interested in the early years of MST3K and have money to burn. Some of the riffs made me laugh out loud... but there are startlingly few of them (even compared to Comedy Central years: Season Two--when I started to watch the show). If you are a first time viewer of MST3K or became a fan during the Sci-Fi years, I would recommend Eegah, Skydivers or either Shorts 1 and 2 to start you off."
5,Great outdoor feeder,This is a great feeder to use outdoors. It keeps the food from getting wet unlike other available feeders. We had the same feeder before until it wore holes in the bottom. Reinforced feet on the bottom would make this feeder last much longer.
4,Doggie diner,"Good product, I have used them for years, the lid could be built better but I use a brick on top. will feed my shepherd for a week or so!"
2,Mount It!,This item if you can't mount it doesn't really work well! If the dogs knock it over mine the door stays open for the bugs and rain to get in and ruin my food! I can't mount mine where my dog is so it was a big waste of money!
3,auto dine 25,"This unit works fine unfortunately my dogs keep knocking it over, I watched both of them feeding and noted that the access door is low and would work well for small dogs, so to make it work for my dogs I have had to put on bricks.Also the capacity is less then 25lbs"
5,Automatic Dog Feeder,"It is the best, once you teach your dogs to eat out of one you never have to worry about bugs or birds in there food again."
5,Great for Chickens too!!,This is a great automatic feeder for chickens too. The only thing you have to do is prop the door (left) open for the chickens to get to the feed. The lip on the feeder keeps them from scratching the feed out & wasting it.
3,The Art of the Lathe,"I bought this book to increase my imagination and creativity. It is a little more than a ""coffee table"" book, with 69 pages of turning instuctions,and 89 pages of incredible works by different artists (Bud Latven, William Schmidt, Hugh McKay, and many more). To me, this inspiring book has sparked my interest in the lathe again."
3,haven't I seen that title before?,"""Go Tell the Spartans"" is the title of a very good Vietnam war flick starring Burt Lancaster. You can find it on Amazon in VHS video format.As a book, it was published by Jove under the same title about the time the movie was released. You can find it on Amazon under the title of ""Incident at Muc Wa"" by Daniel Ford.-- Matt"
5,Love it!,I love this set. It is well worth the money. Very good quality. It is larger than I thought it would be. It makes cooking much more enjoyable.
3,"Impressive, But You Better Be Making a Lot of Pasta","This is a very nice pasta pot, with a pull-out basket. The only knock is that the basket doesn't extend all that far down into the (very large) pot; thus, if you're making a relatively smaller amount of pasta, you still need to boil a very large amount of water in order to have a high enough level to cover the basket."
4,A childhood favorite I'm passing on to my daughter,"I loved this book as a child. I was really happy to find a used version to add to my daughter's collection. It's essential for any horse lover - such a sweet, classic story! Although it was written in the 50's or 60's I think, it's relevant again due to current environmental issues of habitat loss and land preservation. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the illustrations, although lovely, are in a very soft pencil. Some color would probably make it more interesting to read to younger children."
2,MercMan,"This book would be ideal for anyone who is new to trading or to developing mechanical systems. However, while it describes the basic steps, it falls short of giving you the detailed information required to develop, back test, and assess the results of a technical trading system. Basic common-sence stuff about testing and money manegement but insufficient depth to actually use this correctly. No discussion about referential statistics (statistical significance, std deviation, std error, etc.. all the maths you NEED if you really want to build and test a robust system) Also, Pring correctly point out that no system will work all the time but doesn't clearly explain (aside from waiting for mounting losses) how you should look for warning signs that the system is performing below expectations. All-in-all, a good starting point but let's you down if you are looking for a complete, start to finish, 'how to' book (which, incidently, is how the book is advertised!)"
2,470x magnification,"Advertising that this telescope can operate at 470x magnification is misleading, to put it kindly. Common rules of thumb in astronomy would recommend this telescope good for up to about 120x (50x per inch of lens diameter) maximum on a night of stable sky conditions."
3,Great Value for good old campy horror flicks,"Very good value for the movies. I really like House on Haunted Hill and Thirteen Ghosts. The other movies for me were good, but not my favorites. Fun group of movies for when in the mood for some horror. Plus Paris Hilton gets killed in House of Wax. That was a plus right there."
1,Why Bother?,"I purchased my corkscrew for $10.00 at ""Linens N Things."" Why on earth would I spend twice that to replace only the screw?"
1,this game is not worth the money,My son is 7 and he got it for Christmas. He played with it for one day and Pikachu would not do anything. Pikachu does not recognize very many words and my son got frustrated with it. I do not recommend this one to anyone.
3,"An OK game, but expensive","I rented this game and it is quite cute. I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it's not really worth the money unless you're one of those people who would to anything to have a real Pikachu. What I would do even if you are a Pokémon Fanatic is just rent this game a couple times till it gets old which I think would be fairly quick."
1,Do not waste your money on this crud PEOPLE!,"This game is horrible, sure it is a cool idea to have finally a game with voice recognition but it has like 2 percent recognition . And the gameplay is horrible. All you do is go and look for food or play pinata or play catch with a beachball. Oh yeah the story is bad too."
1,Hey You ...,This game is so stupid. You have to say Pikachu about a million times just so you can get the little yellow butthead to turn around. The comercial is bad too. The kid cares for the stupid Pikachu more than his dog. Then the dog says wheres the love. I will tell you where the love is. Well its definitly not in the game so it must be up someones ... I do not reccomend this gameThe game I reccomend Diddy Kong Racing. Do not get this game because it really sucks.
3,This Game Was Sorta Okay,"I bought Hey You, Pikachu when it first came out - costing me eighty dollars. It was not worth the money, and its already gone down in a few months by 50%. If you really like to say stuff to pikachu, and want toplay little games with it, then go buy this, by all means. I'm 12, and I didn't really think much of this game, but I enjoyed it for about 3 weeks. It has become boring, so I play it only a little bit. It *was* fun at first. This would be great for littler kids who think its ""neato"" to play & talk with Pikachu, but those with a more mature mindset would think its quite...well...silly/stupid. If you play, then don't for a while, then play it again, it becomes fun, but not for a long period of time. I love Pokemon, but I think they coulda done a better job on this one. The graphics are pretty poor too, so if you are a perfectionist, this is a no-no. It depends on who you are, and how much you think you would enjoy it - spend your money wisely!"
1,"big expectations, bigger disappointment","The idea for the game was fun & exciting, but Nintendo should have waited until they perfected it before they actually released it. Pikachu is a cute & funny Pokemon & the idea of spending a day with one of your own is an exciting idea for any Pokemon fan. But the game doesn't work. Pikachu rarely recognizes any of the commands given, and getting him to do what you want him to do is virtually impossible, (pun intended.) My three gamers/Pokemon trainers spent hours working with this game with only marginal success. It is a total frustration for the 1st grader who bought it. Sad, it could have been such a great game."
4,Perfect virtual pet game!,"I tried the Japanese version of this game, it's sort of like a virtual pet thing. The voice recognization is really good. I would have rated it 5 stars, but i can't read Japanese, so i don't know the whole story."
1,Hard to figure out and not very interesting when you do!,"When my son got the game for Christmas he was very excited. We hooked it up right away. But after about 5 minutes the excitement faded and he went to play with his other toys. Even with my husband and myself feeding him the lines to use, he couldn't get Pikachu to do what he wanted. When he finished playing, I gave it a shot thinking maybe he wasn't saying the words clearly enough, but it still did it's own thing. Pikachu would walk past the item we told him to get and do something completely different. As soon as we finally got one thing done on a stage(if we were lucky), it would say it's time to leave and so we got no where in the game. Please borrow it from a friend, rent it if possible, or better yet buy a pet fish(more entertaining and cheaper) for your children before you spend your hard-earned money on this game."
3,No money? No game!,"If you really want to play with Pikachu without wasting too much money, I recommend that you go over to Blockbuster Video and rent it instead of buy it. Why? Because it costs way too much money! Otherwise, it's a fair game to play. You just have to be less than 12 years of age to play, or the game won't let you play it at all."
5,A Great Poke'mon Game,"It was a really good game even though it was a little childish .I think that it gets a little boring after awile,becuse it was really aming tward the little kids,Though it was good I think the best game for N64 will be Zelda."
1,no accessories,I order this game for grandson x-mas when he opened it there where no asscessory with like they showed on the sellers guide wanta know how to get them or why they wheren't there.
2,this is kinda lame,when I first played it it was fun but when my friend showed(I think that's how you spell it)me the nintendo in the room I thought it was worse than my mairo kart 64. you could buy it BUT don't blame anybody if it turnes out lame.but the fishing's good. (I think the fishing is the only thing that is gooooooooooooooooooooooood
3,hey you read a review,the game is fun but after you play it it gets kinda boring and the mic is cheap
2,Extremly Babyish,"This game is for babies! It is such a little kid game. I mean, I like the idea of telling Pikachu what to do, but it's more of a little kids game,really think about it before buying this game."
1,It STINKS!,"This is one of the worst games ever. I thought the voice recognition would be cool, but it doesn't work at all. Also, it is extremely boring. If you want my advice don't waste your money."
1,Must have voice rcognition unit and microphone.,I ordered this game from videonational.com and it arrived with missing parts. This game is useless withouth the voice recognition module and microphone. I could not play it.
1,ThIs GaMe is bad,"This game is bad! I mean one minute your playing the ""game"" and another minute your watching T.V! This game is not at all fun! The microphone is bad! Pikachu does not listen! The graphics are worse than the snes! This game should have been released for the nes! If you want this game rent it because it is not worth the $!"
3,Pikachu is here again,"Just another pokemon game..... The game play is good, but the voice thing does not work good. Half and half. A other bad thing it gets boring. My finaly word is, pokemon fan buy, if not don't buy."
2,A waste of time...,"Alright, I may not be the biggest Pokemon fan there is, but I know a flop when I see one. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of seeing those little Japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of, and if you leave it for a second it dies. I suggest pulling out one of those old Tamagotchi's, it will save you some cash.Overall, I give Hey You! Pikachu 2 stars. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because even though this game is pointless, that Pikachu sure is cute! I would only recommend it to people who's kids are die-hard Pokemon fans."
1,This game is [bad],"This game is [bad].I hate any game that has to do with pokemon.My little brother bought this game thinking it would be fun.The first time i played it i almost threw the controller at the ground and then set it on fire.He never understands what you say,he gets angry for no reason, and he throws [stuff] at you and laughs.I tried to sell it on ebay buy it now for 1 pennie and still no one bought it. When will nintendo learn that the pokemon craze is over and no one likes it any more."
2,Too ahead of its time,"This game is trying a very cutting-edge kind of technology and putting it into a video game, which has never been done before at this scale. That means that means that the character interaction with the player hasn't fully developed. Pikachu doesn't respond to you half the time when you talk to him. If this game were on Gamecube (not N64), the graphics would be a lot better and the technology might fit in better. But over all, it's gonna be a while before this technology is fully mastered."
1,Do not buy,"I like Poke'mon, but do not buy this game! The peoffesor runs the whole thing, Pikachu never listens, there is a time limit (...). Be smart, don't buy it!"
2,Pikachu is focused on the banana.....,"(An actual line from the game) You know those interactive-PC toys? This is the best one made yet; it is not a game. Sure the mini games are fun, but they are unrelated to Pikachu in any way, shape, or form. The lack of instructions and a VERY limited vocabulary leed to sheer frustration much of the time, and Pikachu recognizes only high-pitched voices, as the main audience is pre-pubescent. The game is a little addictive, but you end up asking yourself, ""That's It?"" And it is...it's not a big game, and it is at times not very fun either. It is life with Pikachu, which should be fun, but it's more like spending your life with your dog. He's fussy, noisy, and sometimes dumb. no real difference here. Rent this game if you're under 10, then go spend time with a real pet or a Tamagotchi or something."
5,Gluten-Free Spice Cake Mix,This is one of the best gluten-free mixes around. It is especially good when mixed with pumpkin to make pumpkin bread. You wouldn't know that it's gluten free.
2,No BAM!,"This is just okay! Not the zing and wow I want in spice cake. I know that next time I make this I will definitely spice it up and see how that works. If not so well, they'll end up going on my local freecycle."
5,Gluten-Free Pantry Spice Cake Mix,"This spice cake mix is a winner! My teenaged son was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and we are looking for adaptations of his favorite foods. This tastes like ""regular"" spice cake--add some cream cheese frosting and you are good to go! We will continue to purchase this product."
4,"Enjoyable, but I still like season 1 better","I love catching re-runs of The Fresh Prince (Nick airs at least 4 hours of the show every evening on each of its channels, which equals 12 hours of His Funky Freshness each day). But I gotta admit: I definitely prefer the first season to all the others. There's always a few episodes from season 2-6 that I didn't care for that much. Hints of Will's arrogance and Carlton's whiny neuroticism begin to surface in many of these episodes, which got worse as the seasons went on. This is a huge contrast from Will's mischievousness and silly demeanor from the first season. Plus, I liked the original set better! My least favorite episode from this second season was ""The Aunt Who Came to Dinner"", in which Will and Carlton try to score with two French girls they're double-dating.But, there definitely are some classics on this disc, like ""She Ain't Heavy"", ""Hilary Gets a Job"", ""Cased Up"", and my personal fave, ""Did the Earth Move""."
2,"The best of soul train, vol 4","I was very disappointed. Ordered it for husband. I was misinformed, thought it was video. Music only.The best of soul train,vol 4"
2,More Noir than Surf,"This was billed as surf noir which sounded catchy, but the surf part plays a distant second fiddle to the darker aspects of a crime novel. An ok read, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. Also, the idea of a young man that actually built a custom Harley and then left home on the bus rather than on his bike was too much for me."
2,tapping the cliches,"this is a pretty good surfing story but that's not saying much. anyone who knows surfing knows the movies and books about it are a joke. kem nunn needs to join a good fiction workshop. get rid of the excessive passive voice--ike was looking at the ocean becomes ike looked at the ocean-- and cut down on the description. the first time ike sees the ocean nunn pours on the description. what hemingway said about the iceberg is true. just give the reader a whiff of the pacific, and move the story forward. the reader will sense the ocean and it will be much more effective. instead nunn writers four pages of description. most of the characters are very close to being complete cliches. if i hear one more elder surfer trying to teach a younger surfer of the soul of the ocean, i'm liable to start singing kumbyya. i barely got through this book. his other book, the dogs of winter, is better, though still annoying and cliched"
3,Outstanding but fatally flawed,"Three and half stars. Outstanding for the most part, fatally flawed near the end. A grim tale of wasted talent and paradise lost. As second generation SoCal, I witnessed the transtion of the OC from a great place to live into an overcrowded, often violent/amoral sprawl. Nunn's characters and atmosphere spot-on. Some nice slices of irony, particularly with the title. Occasionally marred by verbosity, but mostly lucid -- met the challenge of describing surfing. Narrative was well-paced, suspenseful, driving to anticipated revelation, then clunk -- a preposterous climax dissolving several characters. Too bad, because as I read along, I had high hopes for a real work of art. Ultimately, TAPPING THE SOURCE speaks to the thousands of talented (and not so talented) young people who wasted it all in the pursuit of getting high. Another stain on the progressive philosophy of life..."
2,not well plotted,"People are claiming this is a well plotted novel, but I don't see how. The story goes forward only because Preston is so tight lipped that Ike must stay in Huntington Beach to figure things out. This struck me as a bald-faced plotting device -- rather than something believable evolving out of Preston's character. The ending is fantastically ghoulish, and totally random. Nothing in the story lays the trail for it. Again, it didn't evolve naturally out of what came before. A good story should be a surprise without being a surprise, if that makes any sense.On the positive side character development is very good, for Ike and Hound especially."
3,Tapping the Source,"It held my attention until the forced ending.. it made me want to go surfing though, so can't be all bad."
4,A Source of Good Entertainment,"The growling Harley Davidsons and pier pounding surf make this a read easy to sink your teeth into. Intrigue is kept high with tweak after tweak of plot and scene. Kem Nunn brings to flesh characters that easily carry you away into a far out bad trip. At that age of young adulthood with so many confused love emotions, Ike (protagonist), shows us that relationships are about choices of commitment rather than blood."
5,A Race to the Finish,"If I ever go on a tour, I hope that I have Madeline Marlborough for my tour guide (along with a stress test before I leave). It is clear that Carol Parrilli knows the travel business and can add that knowledge to her imagination to spin a most exciting tale. Once the tour group started their ""adventure,"" I found myself racing to the end to see how everything worked out.I look forward to Madeline's next adventure!"
5,I Love It,"My CD was delivered right on time and it arrived in perfect conditions. I love Juan Gabriel songs, so I recommend it to anyone that likes a little of romanticism. I just love it."
5,FINALLY! The awaited return!,"I was delighted several years ago when I discovered that J.G had recorded a new cd. I was a fan of his earlier work, ""Insensible"", ""Querida"", ""El Noa Noa I and II"", ""Tus Ojos Mexicanos Lindos"" etc... but this new sound captured me even further.As another reviewers said, his voice has matured and his notes more soulful. I would highly recommend this cd for anyone who ever liked even ONE of JG's songs. As my fellow reviewer said, ""This was worth waiting for!"""
5,Stands up nicely to a 2 year old,This light is great. It was bigger than I expected but cute. It charged up in no time and we've been using it ever since....i even travel with it to keep the nightlight consistent for my kid. I had to buy a nightllight that didn't need a plug because my baby thought it would be fun to pull it out of the wall. And I needed one that would last all night and this one fit all my requirements. My only complaint is that this light is BRIGHT. I mean you could probably read by it it's so bright......we solved this problem with an old pair of toddler stretch mittens....some small socks or such would do the same thing.... and it has actually worked out nice cause it's like having a dimmer on it and I can change it if I need more light. Plus it has stood up to being dropped and banged and played with.All in all I would buy this light again.......and again!
4,"Bought it for the Nursery, but using it in the Bedroom!","I bought this item because I thought it would be cute in the nursery. I didn't realize that when it was on its base, it is NOT on, so it didn't work out like I planned. I have kept it in the nursery to charge, but our newborn is still sleeping in a bassinet in our bedroom. Each evening, I grab the nightlight out of the nursery and put it on a shelf above the bassinet in our room. It is bright enough that I can watch him sleeping, as well as see to feed him and change him in the middle of the night. It is a bright nightlight, but I am glad for that. Overall I am very happy with this nightlight."
3,Not the Tykelight Buddy,"The light is cute! But the item we received was the Tykelight, NOT the Tykelight Buddy shown in this picture. The Buddy comes with the easy charging base with no contacts shown. The item I received requires you to plug an adapter card directly into the light to charge it. I am hoping they will send me the Buddy instead of refunding my money because this light will be perfect for my toddler!"
4,Just what you bargain for,This product is just what the doctor ordered. It takes a little while to clean the whole screen throughly but in the end have a shiny glossy screen that looks just like new is worth it. I travel a lot with business and having my MBpro sit in the office accumulating dust is not good for the computer...so I would suggest purchasing the travel packets as well--they work great on the screen and excellent on the keyboard...and they will make it through security in your briefcase.
4,Works great for screen & new smudges,"This product works great for my ibook G4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case, although it seems like I'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen. Don't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time, though. Mr. Clean Magic Eraser works well for that ... but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer. Otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard."
4,great product,"Cleans the surfaces of my electronics and the screens, just like it said it would. What else is there to say? A free chocolate cookie and I would have given it 5 stars."
5,works for macBook Pro,"Agree with the other reviewers; this product works very well, but use as directed or you'll be left with streaks. Do its as directed and the screen (and case) will look clear and clean; also works nicely on iPod, cell phone and HDTV."
2,Purchase Monster iClean Instead,"I purchased iKlear with a new Apple Macbook. I was not pleased with the product. It comes with three cloths and it is unclear which cloth is for what. Additionally, I found it difficult to get a streak-free clean of the LCD screen.I just purchased and recieved Monster's iClean from Amazon. It is a fantastic product. Easy to use (only one cloth), no streaks, and costs less."
3,Not very sturdy,"I have had two Buddy Systems, on the first one the clasp by the collar snapped and broke. I really enjoyed running with my hands free, so I ordered a second one with the reflector ""tape"", within a week all the ""tape"" had peeled off and most recently, probably a year after purchase the clasp has once again broken. I won't purchase another one unless the company changes the clasp."
5,Best doggie investment for pregnant or new mom,"This is the best doggie leash money can buy. I first got it to run with my two German Shepherds. It works fantastically and dogs never pulled again. It's very easy to assemble and it's very safe. Then I got pregnant, I walked my two dogs till I was 8.5 months using this contraption. I felt very safe while I was wearing this. Now my baby is 8 months old and this device is priceless. We go out on walks with the stroller, and the dogs using the buddy system. I don't have enough words to say how much I love the buddy sys. leash. I lost it one time and immediately had to purchase another one. The product quality is excellent and the delivery was very prompt. I definitely recommend this product."
3,"Heats well, but not for long","This heated car mug worked well for a couple of weeks, but then the connection between the mug and a wire stopped working. Something wrong with the connecting parts. It just does not stay connected. The connection between the wire and a car (sigarett outlet) works well. But it does not help much, because the wire does not connect to the mug, so it does not do the intended job. My coffe is cold."
1,too hot,"mug gets way too hot.I think it would boil if it was pluged in and unattended.also bottom of mug gets too hot,poorly insulated.gets too hot"
1,Don't waste your money...,These things don't last. I bought this to replace a similar one that we had given my mom. This thing didn't even last a month. Her original one (don't know if it was the same make-- probably not) lasted quite awhile so I was hoping this one would as well even though I read a bunch of negative reviews. No such luck.
1,total disappointment,"I ordered this mug on Dec. 10, 2010. It was to be a Christmas present for my husband, who spends his days mostly in his pick up truck. He was thrilled with it as hew drinks coffee and tea all day. Unfortunately by Jan.6, 2011 the heated mug stopped working. The power cord seemed to be the problem. It didn't receive or send juice to the mug. It isn't the outlet in the car as all other electronics work. needless to say the gift of the heated car mug, that started out as a fabulous gift, turned into a total disappointment. I therefore give this product a big thumbs down."
4,Hot at last~,"This little cup keeps my coffee HOT and I do mean hot! I despise cold or lukewarm coffee and this does the trick for me. I think it would even heat up room temperature coffee. I wish it was stainless steel inside as well as outside but it works and that's the thing. My first cup failed after 2 or 3 days but the company sent me another right away. Good customer service! No more cold beverages in the car. You can jump out, do your errands and come back and still drink your coffee.Wonderful."
1,Quality is marginal,"Definite ""plastic"" smell and taste, even after 3 washings. And the cord doesn't want to stay plugged into the mug. :("
1,burnt out,"This heated mug worked fine for a month, using it a couple times a week, but it has now burnt out and no longer works. It appears to be very poorly made. Therefore, I would say it has been a disappointment - a gip to put it bluntly."
1,Piece of junk!,"This is a piece of junk made in China. Don't buy.Like other reviewers, the coffee tastes awful - potentially poisonous with the hot coffee + plastic mix. It smells aweful.The connection wasn't working after a few weeks and the metal outside started rusting.I stopped using it for coffee - instead I removed the plastic container and started using it to scoop hardened snow melting salt from a bag (since the metal cup has sharp edge)!!!"
1,High hopes...dashed,It is such a great idea to not have to pour from a thermos to have warm coffee on trips but I have yet to find one that will last more than once or twice! Bummer
1,Caution!!! Tastes & Smells Like Chemicals. ? Leaches Chemicals.,"This is an awful Chinese mug. After multiple washing, and even leaving it overnight filled with water and dish-washing detergent, it smell and tastes like chemicals. The smell is a little similar to kerosene odor. I suspect it leaches chemicals from the plastic. Besides the bad taste, it can't be good to your health!"
4,Region 1 vs. Region 2,"Hi,I really liked the dvd!For all the European people : I'm from Belgium and normally, the site says I probably can only play region 2 DVD's, but I was able to play this DVD, which is regio 1. So don't worry and just buy the DVD, because it's lots cheaper than in Europe ...Bye"
5,Great Series!,"I love the Veronica Mars series, so sad that it ended after only 3 seasons.Veronica is whitty, sarcastic, smart, and fun. Every episode has its own mystery along with the season long mystery. I enjoyed them all! Great acting, great writing, not sure what went wrong to end it!"
5,The Best Show on Television,"Believe me I don't say this lightly. This show is that good. If you enjoy brilliantly written scripts and perfectly cast characters, this show is for you!"
5,Out of the blue,"I never really watched any shows on UPN. I only started watching this show in the off season because I heard some good reviews about it. One episode and I was addicted. Bell is just has ""it"". That thing that makes you pay attention when she's on screen. I highly recommend buying this show on DVD."
4,Good series,"This is a good show. Unfortunately it does not garner much in the ratings department since it is on UPN and up against Lost on Wednesday nights. It's a little bit Buffy (a butt-kicking heroine), a little O.C. (it's set in a fictional wealthy town in southern California), and a little Twin Peaks (the show centers on the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lily Kane). Kristin Bell shines as Veronica. Some of the stand alone episodes could have been stronger, but Veronica's determination to find Lily's murderer keeps the series going. As one reviewer said, the last four to five episodes are really good. Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy, has lavished quite a lot of praise on the show. The first season was a great start. Coincidentally, Alyson Hannigan guest starred on the show in the first season, and Charisma Carpenter has become a series regular in the second."
5,Awesome Show!,"This show is the best show I have seen in a long time - possibly ever. It's a show for teens but smart enough for adults too. I love this show so much. If people would just watch it they too would love it! The show is perfect in every aspect, the writers are geniuses, and the cast is phenomenal. If you want some more substance in your tv programming, buy this set of dvds and watch season 2 on UPN Wednesday nights at 9."
4,one of my top guilty pleasures,"This is not the sort of show I am usually interested in. But after reading numerous words of praise, I took the leap. Now I'm embarassed to say I'm a fifty-something male enamored of the whole Neptune crowd. What sets this show apart is the great dialogue: witty without relying on endless stale James Bond-type puns like most ""witty"" detective shows. (For example, I'm almost at the point where I have to skip the opening of CSI because of Grissom's ""cute"" observation about the crime.) The relationships between the characters are also well developed. This is no Sopranos, but every meal doesn't have to be filet mignon. I'm always happy with a high quality cheeseburger. The first two seasons of Veronica Mars fit the bill."
3,"Great show, but no 5.1 sound?",No 5.1 sound makes Homer something something...Go crazy? Don't mind if I do.
3,High School Girl doing too much,"although this is a well done p.i. type story line, it gets a little impossible to believe that this (16 - 17) girl can do a (mans) detective work and still show up at high school after staying up all night (by mans i mean grown up) but other than that it is entertaining and fun to try and figure how she will pull it all together (she does at the end of every eposide)"
1,One of the worst shows i've ever seen,"This show is slow, ignorant, and doesn't deserve to stay on the air. I urge people to stay away from this show and watch good quality shows such as The O.C., One Tree Hill, Law and Order, or some other show that is worth watching. The only words that describe this show is TOTAL CRAP."
5,MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SHOW EVER,"I'm 26 yr old female, just watched all seasons through Netflix, and I absoloutely LOVE this show and the characters. This is hands down my favorite tv series yet!!"
5,"Sleeper Hit; the best show you're not watching, but should.","If you don't buy this, you are missing out. It is a diamond in the rough. Everything about this show is wonderful. The characters have meat on their character bones. The plot twists and turns and you never know what is around every bend. Two thumbs way up."
5,Great show,"Too short lived a show, Kristen Bell is a fabulous actress and the entire premise of the show (awhile a bit predictable sometimes) was a great twist on the sleuthing genre."
5,For a friend,I didn't actually buy this for myself - it was bought as a present for my friend in another state - but I like the show.
3,A penas aceptable,"Veronica Mars en su primera temporada, es una serie apenas aceptable. Muy lenta y con pocos personajes interesantes, en momentos aburre.El personaje principal esta bastante bien logrado y salva con buena nota la mayoria de los capitulos.Va de menos a mas, mejorando bastante conforme llega al final, lo que deja una esperanza para la segunda temporada."
5,Surprizing,"I knew next to nothing about Veronica Mars when I finally chose to buy it. I am a fan of the long cancelled Firefly and among the many topics of discussion were great shows that do not get enough attention or have been cancelled. Wonderfalls is among those cancelled, but Veronica Mars goes on. That said, I couldn't see a ""teen"" show being of interest to me until I read my hundredth or so promotion raving about the great writing and characters.I must say that the show surpassed my expectations in all ways. I am an avid book reader and what I love about this series is how every episode brings about both answers and new questions, which, by the end, make the whole series that much better.I recommend this very highly and so long as they maintain the respect and faithfullness to the quality being displayed, I hope to see Veronica Mars for many years to come."
5,Great show,"I really had doubts about this show, but a trusted friend talked me into watching it for the first time. I was hooked. The writing is superb. The twists, plots, subplots and characterizations are all far beyond the standards for television today. The characters are fun to love, fun to hate and fun to wonder if they are good or bad. I think Rob Thomas is a genius. In a televisionland that is inundated with the stupidity of reality tv, this is a breath of fresh air. Well worth the money to buy the DVD set and well worth your time to watch."
5,Veronica Mars Season 1 excellent!,"I recently bought Veronica Mars season 1 and 2 for my sister because I knew she liked the program, and she told me how much she liked it, and I was hooked on the first episode. It is really clever the way that the plot works out and a really good watch, I don't know what will happen next! I haven't lost interest and I can't wait to finish the season and start season 2."
3,Scratched,The last two discs of the season were scratched where it would stop playin at a certain point and i would have to try to restart it and try to clean the discs so that it would play through the scratched up parts.
4,Great Show,"Veronica Mars is not only a great show, it's a smart show. Not many shows these days except maybe Heros or 24 can carry a story arc over an entire season. Mars does this very well while adding shorter storylines to each episode. As far as versus season 2, #1 is much better."
5,LUV VERONICA,I just can't get over how much I love this show. I just got done watching the season finale and i am so bummed cause I can't wait till the second season. I've watched from the first episode on and every show just amazes me! Who would have thought that upn would make such a great show! I can't wait till the first season comes out which should be in September according to the creators website.
5,"Amazing, Interesting, and exciting.","Veronica Mars, is the first television show in a long time to constantly keep me guessing. I love the creative plot and the connection of themes made throughout each episode. I recommend this show highly. You'll love every minute of this spunky one of a kind teenage girl's life."
3,Peeling chrome,"Let me first say I o like the look of this, we bought it to match a Victorian collection Delta faucet and it matches great. Within 2 weeks, the chrome started to peel of of the large towel ring. Amazon had me a new one within a few days. Hopefully, this one won't peel and we just were unlucky with the first one. I will update in a few months. Great price as always."
2,Good name poor quality control,I really like Moen products but the two towel rings I purchased are defective. After anchoring the mounting brackets to the wall and then fastening the rings to the bracket I immediately noticed that the rings were not properly aligned with the mount. The rings are crooked by about 10 degrees. You can wiggle the ring to straighten it but it just returns to the previous position. I have uploaded a picture to the product to illustrate the problem. I have not seen any other reviews with this complaint so perhaps the problem is restricted to only a few of the inventory with the oil rubbed bronze finish. I cannot stand having hardware that is not square and plumb so I chose to return the towel rings to Amazon.
1,Peeling Chrome! Peeling Chrome!,"I didn't have to wait for two weeks for the chrome to peel off the ring. These parts have been in the box waiting for installation in a new bathroom. When my contractor opened the box, most of the ring chrome just fell off! These rings were not chromed correctly. They are junk. Do Not Buy. Of course, Murphy's Law, we noticed the failing chrome plating a week after the Amazon return period."
4,Towel Ring,This product seems to be well built and was easy to install. I have had it for a few months now and have had no problems.
1,Smells very badly of rubber!!!!,"Product details stated specifically formulated so it will not have strong smell of rubber. Not true!!!! Smelled bad when I pulled it from box and the smell transferred to my hands. Soaking in hot soapy water right now, if that does not help will be shipping back. Would make your whole car smell like rubber on a hot summer day."
1,Contains natural rubber,"It is a well constructed, quality product. Unfortunately, it is made with natural latex rubber, which can be a serious problem for those of us with latex allergies. If you have ever experienced hand itching and / or pain after wearing rubber gloves, or have food allergies, or any other sensitivities, DO NOT USE this, or a similar, product. The more you do, the worse the problem will get, until it eventually becomes life threatening."
4,Won't Spin Itself Off,"I was looking for a fun and modestly price steering wheel cover to replace my worn one and decided on this. The Taz graphics really look nice, though the wheel feels a bit thinner than I had hoped. With that said, the cover went on very easily compared to my previous one and the rubber grips are well crafted and feel durable. It won't protect your hands quite as much from temperature extremes, but I prefer it over cloth materials that more quickly wear down or get dirty.I am really happy with my purchase and it just makes me smile when I see it."
2,A hair too big,"I have a grant gt steering wheel that's 14"" and this cover starts at 14.5"". I'll have to wait until I get another car to see how it feels."
2,We'll see......,"Hello Everyone,I ordered this product for my 2007 Tacoma Truck and it fits great HOWEVER, I wonder just how long the inlaid pattern of Tazz is going to last. My biggest fear is that a couple of really hot days is going to find Tazz peeling off the wheel cover, and that will have me on the hunt for yet another cover.If you live in a cooler climate your results might be better than mine but for now, I'm not holding my breath. (I should have known nothing could contain the Tazz within) (LOL)Ciao!"
4,Handy Collection of Alphabets,"This is a convenient booklet (only 64 pages) of the English alphabet in a few sets of designs available on the companion CD-ROM. I find searching for a appropriate design for use as a drop cap in a document is easier with the booklet than without. Hence I think it is very practical and useful.However, there might be some of those images that you might want to ""re-touch"" as they have dots (probably due to the scanning) on them. If the publisher had rectified this, I would have rated this as five-star."
4,The First Noel Inspires Adults As Well As Children!,"This book was written with Children in mind. It is beautifully illustrated and it has a great selection of songs:O Come All Ye Faithful, We Three Kings of Orient Are, Hark The Herald Angels Sing, Good King Wenceslas, Away In A Manger, The Holly And The Ivy, O Little Town Of Bethlehem, The First Noel, Song Of The Crib, Silent Night, It Came Upon A Midnight Clear, I Saw Three Ships, We Wish You A Merry ChristmasThe songs have notes displayed for piano and guitar accompaniement. While the book is written for children, I found that it was inspiring for all ages and is sure to be a family heirloom as the years progress."
5,Very pretty!,These starfish knobs will go in the bathroom and kitchen on the drawers as a part of the major remodel. They are very pretty and stylish and should make a nice statement in my condo on the beach.
5,just what I needed for a lost adapter,"I lost an adapter like this and couldn't charge my ZEN. Regular stores didn't have it but if they had, it would have cost me around $30.Good price and exactly what I needed."
5,It works!,"I lost my adapter to my beloved Zen and thought I was out of luck. I found this on Amazon , the seller sent it quickly and it works great. My device and I couldn't be happier."
4,Zen Adapter,"The supplier worked fine, and on a very reasonable time, specially because were close to Christmas Holiday."
3,Not really anything to rate,"It's a charge/sync/output connector. It works as advertised, and the seller delivered it quickly (faster than I expected, in fact). I had to order a replacement, since I lost mine. The one serious design flaw in an otherwise outstanding portable media player (the Zen Vision M), is that it requires this small, easily misplaced, doo-dad in order to actually do anything with it."
5,It works,"Not much to say. Sucks that it is so spendy to relace a piece of plastic, but required to charge your MP3 player. Five stars because it worked."
3,"Helpful, yes.",When i bought my Vision:M i realized that this little guy is important for transferring media from the computer to the player. But because of its size it can be easily lost (I haven't lost mine but i see how it could happen). For that sole reason alone it is helpful but it takes FOREVER to charge the battery and for a while it was a bit of a nuisance to let it charge completely.So here's what i boil it down to: If you're putting stuff on VERY good! Charging VERY bad... you'd be better off with the wall charger which is sold separately but... it does the job and does it well. Good luck!
3,Do some research,"The refurb unit received looks as new. Before and after purchase I strongly suggest you look at discussion threads on the misticriver web site. You need to understand things like ""the ums trick"", the differences between the firmware in the US version and the asian version of the player, and the kinds of things that other users have had trouble with. If you buy one, before you load it up with all your music files, load two or three albums or playlists and get a feeling for how it works. Then, after reading he misticriver threads, go to the iRiver web site, download the updater for the latest firmware, and do a reformat/restore of the player. You will end up doing it some time in the future, anyway, so learn how to do it before you fill the player up with all your music. It works, but it has a personality. The music quality is great into a pair of circa $30 Sennheiser headphones. The FM tuner is a great plus if you like listening to FM radio."
2,It may become a ghost.....,I loved this product for 4 months (it does have lots of gadgets that I love) and then.....for no reason at all my computer no longer recognizes it! Rhapsody doesn't recognize it....It's turned into a ghost although I can see it!I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....
1,badly remanufactured,"This seemed like a great bargain. It worked adequately for two days, then began various problems. Downloads didn't work, it skipped, etc.The refund was very prompt."
2,disappointing,"This mp3 player was great when I first got it. However, I've not had it even a week yet, and it has begun freezing up and having other various problems. I would not suggest this item."
3,old technology and flaky to use,"There are more modern devices music and this was ok for awhile. It does not serve as an external disk like a flash disk except sometimes XP gives it a drive letter. Then you can delete files otherwise they pile up. The only ""official"" interface is via MediaPlayer playlists. The battery turns off sometimes but usually after it says it has powered down, I find it dead the next day. Have learned to disconnect the battery in desk drawer. Unless your music is organized with actual playlists, this system shows most files as singles, even by the same artist, so plays them one by one. I usually engage the browser mode and it acts like a random file player and that is ok too. Radio is ok but in buildings some stations are weak. Reading text is like text messaging, ok. All in all you get an actual spinning hard drive without much interface. Buy it, sure if you like to tinker and like old lawnmowers."
3,Wonderful While It Lasts,"This mp3 player has wonderful sound quality, is easy to manage, and is lightweight and comes w/ a convenient clip. Unfortunately, it broke down 5 months after I bought it. If your willing to spend the money, go for it. Just don't expect it to last too long."
3,"A good deal , but not without limitations","This is a good camera for $50 but it does have some limitations that more expensive cameras do not suffer from. The picture is decent, nothing special, and the night vision is OK for about 10-15'...but the lack of a wide angle lens makes this camera not very usable for monitoring areas like your front door. You need to mount it at a far distance to get a wide field of view and since its nightvision is only fair that kills its performance.All in all, decent unit for $50, but the nightvision performance and narrow field of view really hurt when compared to CCD cams like Topica's. Good for a CMOS camera but no match for a slightly (OK..over twice the price) more expensive CCD camera."
2,SVAT CV65 Review,"This is an ok camera good construction,easy adjustment,easy installation.Down side,the glowing red led's are a dead give-a-way at night, not a very good camera for home use, because it does not have a wide angle lens, the included lens is a bit out of focus. For the price it should have a wide angle lens."
3,You get what you pay for,"Setup and mounting was easy, it comes with plenty of extra wire. Daytime picture isn't so great and there is no focus so what you have it what you will always have. Night vision is ok at about 10-15'.I have a cheaper Q-see camera that takes a much better picture and has focus."
2,good enough for short term,"I've had this for about 15 months. It is useless now. The field is completely washed out and software adjustments don't correct. It worked for a while, but being on 24/7 seems to have affected its ability to automatically adjust for varying light conditions. I must now buy a new one. . .darn."
2,Ok for the money.,My camera is in an exposed area and looses sound after it rains. The image is not that great but it gets the job done for a security camera.
3,"O.K. for the money, Low Range","This camera would be adequate for 10-15 foot range max. I use 3 Swann Bulldogs and one of these. The bulldogs cost twice as much at time of purchase, but are worth it. They have longer range, better resolution and detail at range. The night vision on the SVAT is only about 10ft max and the image quickly falls off.For outdoor use, when night vision and range is important spend the extra and go for at the minimum a swann bulldog."
3,"Great day camera, terrible night vision unless it is really close","Daytime, this thing works great as a multi-use camera. At night, the night vision part is not good at all unless you are practically right up to the camera."
3,Not as good as the original,"It is pretty clear that Ms. Cave holds many of the same views of society as the original ""My Struggle"". Her views are not as clearly defined as the ""My Struggle"" author though she appears to respect his pioneering work. She may, as she matures, detemine a final solution to the woes she discusses, but they remain peculairly absent."
5,INSPIRED,Ms. Cave's inspirational story really touches me. I feel that everyone who has a question about what it is like to be on welfare should take a look at her book.
4,Good for my purposes,"I purchased this book as a refence source for a novel, and the degree to which Mr. Hudson describes the expedition was perfect for my needs. Particularly useful were the maps and his description of the day-to-day activity of the ""army"" on the march. Unlike many of the reference sources, this one is an easy, as well as informative, read."
4,"Warrior's of the Sun, a great read","I enjoyed this book immensely. As a guy who can take something as dry as ""Darwin's Origin of Species"" to the beach for the weekend, this is a real page turner. The author does a wonderful job of assembling journal entries along with well documented historical data, into an enjoyable read for the interested lay person. It reminds me somewhat of ""Undaunted Courage"" by Stephen Ambrose in both its well documented historical accuracy, and attention to readability by the consuming public. I bought this book mainly out of a life long interest in Southeastern Indian culture, and an interest in the terrain of the region before European settlement. The book delivered in spades on both accounts. I am surprised Hollywood has left this story alone. There is enough violence, death, greed, deceit and sex for 5 movies in Desoto's story.K Cook"
4,De Soto Revealed,I found this book to be an excellent read. I could almost hear the clanking of armor and smell the smoke of the Indian village cooking fires. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in early Southeastern Indian culture as-well-as sixtenth century Spanish conquest.
1,Not one of my favorite law books,"Of all the case books that I have used thus far in my law school career, this book by far is the worst. While some of the cases are interesting, Dressler fails many times to give adequate explantions of many of the topics covered. Dressler does a much more impressive job of conveying the topic in his book ""Understanding Criminal Law""."
3,This criminal law casebook is straight-forward but lacking.,"Dressler's casebook covers each topic of criminal law methodically. His organization of the material is satisfactory, but many of the topics do not include enough specific cases that include modern statutes. I found some of the cases cited to be the exception rather than the rule. Overall, it is easy to read, and many of the cases are interesting. However, I do suggest referring to a hornbook."
3,typical 70's shock book,"while it is interesting to read, it is not well written and is typical of the sexual revalution writings of the 70's. I would like to know who the author is. So far I've read 3 of the taboo works and they have all ended badly, such painful endings to such lusty adventures. they certainly don't add up to the erotica published today. kinda watching the original Star Trek series compared to Avatar. but I satisfied my curiousity of many years."
4,Blow up basket diferent and beautiful,This blow up basket is actually quite unusual. Very nice to put fruits and vegetables to decorate your home. I'd seen in a shop of design products in NY but now bought and worth.
3,interesting but incomplete,"i'm a western herbalist and student of chinese medicine. because of my background, i can surmise some of mein's basis for her conclusions, such as meridian pathways and their associated organs, endocrine hormonal influence, etc. i also think that she came up with the diets for each type via muscle-testing.my primary interest in this book is as background material. as far as individualized diets, i recommend that people find what works for them, regardless of what they read in a book. mein's other pitfalls include not taking into account degenerative diseases, environmental stress, digestive disorders, etc. the biggest value in mein's suggestions is rotation of foods, as it is in most other diets-by-type.we are all biochemically unique individuals and while typing ourselves may be fun, it's just one tool among many and not every tool is clinically useful in every situation."
3,Complicated,"As with others I found this book difficult to follow and much prefer Dr. Abravanel's ""Body Type Diet"" in which one only deals with 4 distinct body types and a lot more guidance in the diet/exercise sections. However, having decided my body type through Abravanel, I found Mein's book to be great supplemental reading. And I am a firm believer that most of us are combinations of types - dominant and subdominant...............so that one needs to really get to know oneself to categorize and sort out what will work best."
1,Don't buy it!,"This book is a big disappointment. The author explains the 25 different types but never gives any physiological reasons for the differences. Once you determine your type she refers you to a vague 4 - page section that lists the dietary requirements and restrictions for your type but once again, she never explains the reasons for the restrictions. There is also a very disturbing, detailed section for each type called ""at your worst"" which describes hideous personality traits that I found very offensive, inaccurate, and totally unrelated to the books subject. If your looking for a book that can help you achieve a healthy, proportionate body then read Body for Life by Bill Phillips. It's uplifting and the program works!"
1,Dont bother,"Very confusing book. Found it difficult to find my ""type"". None of the types matched me and the personality traits were not me at all if the body type remotely fit me. I couldnt decide what type i was at all. The menus were somewhat constrictive unless you can live on nuts and beans for some. Basically if you follow a healthy eating plan with excersize you will lose weight no matter what ""type"" you may be. WELL, duh."
3,An Antique Land,This book didn't seem to have the story line I was used to. I didn't care for it as much as some of his other books.
2,Did I read the same book?,"I found this book extremely dry and slow moving. All the other reviews focus on the master-slave relationship. I kept waiting for this part of the plot to get moving, and it was 200 pages before it even happened. ""The Hungry Tide"" is a far better work by this author."
1,Pedantic drivel,"I'm a history nut -- a couple of months on India then a few on China...then on to Russia, etc. I'm nearly always reading a history book. I had this book in my wish list when my brother bought it for my birthday. A complete waste of his money and my time. Pedantic drivel of an author who deems himself reflective and his thoughts important...and who must love the sound of his own voice...going on and on... I, unfortunately, suffer from the concept that once a book is started it must be finished. So, 3/4 through the thoroughly forced read and still not a glimpse of the ""Indian slave, name unknown, who some seven hundred years before had traveled to the Middle East."" So I don't even know if he ever does make an appearance...and certainly don't care."
4,fascinating read .. makes you want to live in Egypt,i picked this book after hearing a friend talk about his trip to egypt.. i expected a more descrptive kind of book about egypt and was pleasantly surprised with the novella flavour that it actually has.. the author introduces very ordinary characters from present times living through their life.. he juxtaposes this with accounts of the life of a jewish merchant and his indian slave from the 10th century.. and then draws parallels between the social issues during the two time periods which seem surprisingly similar..but the part that i thourougly enjoyed in this book was the village life and characters from the egyptian village and the real life struggles that they were going through.. made me want to hop on the next plane to egypt and see these ppl for myself..
5,Excellence in Amitav Ghosh's Work is the Rule,"Widely-travelled and widely-read friends with a great deal of time spent in India first recommended Amitav Ghosh's writing to me, and one of these women is a writer of considerable excellence herself. Beginning with ""Sea of Poppies"" I was astounded at the breadth and depth of his research and at his extraordinary ability to maintain historical accuracy while weaving numerous individual's stories into a larger work of historical fiction. Each of the important characters is well-defined and realized."
4,Good at first...,"Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is quite a good challenge for even an experienced gamer, like myself. Just like the first, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Shigeru Miyamoto has come out with nothing less than a sheer work of brilliance. With the added power of the Expansion Pak, Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask can pay much more attention to detail. As well as that it also makes defeating the game that much more difficult and all the more rewarding. Like the first Zelda on the Nintendo64 console there are many things to look for other than defeating the major boss. So you must play the game over to find the final tokens of the game. Unfortunately after every treasure of the game is recovered the game loses its brilliance and becomes rather boring. If you are looking for a challenging game and don't want to keep it this is the right game, or if your mentality is rather low."
4,WAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOO,This is a great game. the downside: it is much shorter than ocarina of Time. But hell it still rocks
3,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,"I thought this game was very good but not as good as Zelda:Ocarina of Time. The graphics were much better and it had much more subquests than the original but it didn't have as good of a plot and wasn't challenging enough. For example, in Ocarina of Time, it had 10 levels, three spiritual stones and 7 medallions, 12 songs, and tons of items. Majora's Mask only had 4 levels, 4 remains of the bosses of those levels, 10 songs, and a less amount of items. The good thing about Majora's Mask though is the grpahics, the ability to change to a human, a Deku scrub, a Goron, or a Zora and there were cool new options like the Bomber's Notebook and how there is only three days to beat the game but it is annoying that you have to keep going back in time to save. I would totally recommend this game though because it is still good but it is more for beginners and is more kiddy. If you want a more mature challenging game though, I'd recommend you buying Ocarina of Time."
5,As great as Ocarina of Time!,"This is one of my favorite Zelda games! Yes, it's complex sometimes, but it's still excellent! My brother beat it after 6 years, and it was very much worth watching him! I've had fun playing it myself, even if I haven't gone far. The music is VERY catchy, and one of my favorite things in the game was the masks. They all gave you super cool abilities (at least MOST of them). You've just gotta play it!"
4,Good but could be better,"A Great Game! The graphics are slightly better than the previous Zelda for N64 and the gameplay is awesome. The game does have some flaws though. First of all, it's too short. The game only has four ""temples"" unlike Ocarina of Time, with eight ""temples"". Also the game is to easy. It is almost impossible to die unless you are horrible at video games. Last of all,the game graphics can get cheesy. For example, when you slow down time, the people go slower but the movement of their legs is the same. Overall the game is good but it's not worth the 60 bucks I payed for it"
4,Not as good as Ocarina of Time.,"This is a great Zelda game and a must buy for any RPG fan. But where is Zelda in this game? Its kinda weird with all of the masks, but the graphics are the best possible on n64. I gave Ocarina of Time 5 stars, so i had to give this less because it isnt as good. The time thing is interesting, you can go back in time and collect the same 100 rupee then put it in the bank. There arent as many temples to explore like in OoT. I beat this game a few months ago and i cant really remember any of the temples. But in Oot i will never forget the infamous Water Temple. Definatly buy this to get one last bang out of the dying n64. I am upset that i will not have a gamecube to play the new zelda game, now that i have crossed over to playstation 2, guess ill have to go with the final fantasy series(heard they were pretty good)"
4,Great game- gets old though,"I think this is a good game with very good graphics, and very little corruption (if any). The bosses are amazing, and unique. I also like the storyline and the fact that you can change your identity, and it can make all the difference. I own the old zelda, and i think you should buy that firstOverall-controls-5/5 world size-4/5 things to do-3/5 graphics-5/5 characters-5/5"
4,The Second Legend of Link...,"I think that Majora's Mask was exciting and had a really good plot, but Majora's Mask's looks are very decieving. Just by looking at it changing the moon and causing trouble, in the end it really isn't that hard. I must admit though, the temples were a challenge and some mysteries weren't solved right in front of you. By exploring the four temples and seeing which rooms you haven't been in yet will help you through the dungeons. Tatl will help you too! Honestly, I liked the game a lot but there were only 4 dungeons so I completed the game shortly after I got it."
2,This Game is a Great Disappointment,"I'm sure all of you have played Ocarina of Time. That was a great game, and is still one of my all-time favorites. When I heard about Majora's Mask, I promptly reserved it and got it the day it came out. Upon playing it, I wish I saved my money. Majora's Mask feels as though Nintendo wanted to make a quick buck by recycling Ocarina of Time, and the result is less than stellar. The time limit is extremely tedious, and there are no orginal characters, and the landscape of the game seems limited compared to previous Zelda games. Even A Link to the Past for Super Nintendo and Link's Awakening for Game Boy are better games. Granted, Majora's mask has superior graphics, but it's superiority ends there. My advice: buy Ocarina of time instead, or filing that, rent Majora's Mask before making your decision."
1,Ocarina of time was much better,the reason i don't like majora's mask is because it has a ridiculous story line. first of all you have to do all this junk to get certain things. plus you have to stop the moon from smashing into the earth that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.this game is not loyal to all the previous zelda games nor does it have any returning characters such as princess zelda. ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majora's mask.
1,"Putting A ""Mask"" On A Good Game!",It is sad to say the least that what made this game horrible was the fact that there was time added!! How does it ever make sense that you have temples lodead with many things to get not to mention going into ten different rooms just to get to an enemy yet you only have 72 hours game time to complete the task?! Not to mention side quests and loads of things to do. The sotry line was cool and the graphics were great but this comes nothing close to Ocarina Of Time which I enjoyed sooo much! In fact I think Ocarina Of Time was waaaaaay better then this. If you are going to make a game make the ememies hard and the task difficult but don't add time. Picture if you were half way through a temple and were almost done then time runs out!! That would make you want to pull your hair!! Thankfully from the looks of future games I have seen they did not make that fatal mistake again! I recomend to buy Orcarina Of Time better!
2,"Zelda Mojora's Mask, to buy or not to buy ?","This game is very complicated and can reach a point of annoyance. There's a clock that runs for three days and you always need to watch it. This game is also to much involed with the masks making you crazy about trying to get this and that before you can do this. I severly do not recommed this game to anyone, especially kids with short tempers or can be easily annoyed!"
3,Doesn't live up to the predesessor...,"I just purchased this game, and after a few hours of play, there are many things that I can say are very flawed in the primary construction of this game. First of all, the graphics and sounds (which are both repeatative and annoying) are of no better quality than the first, though there is a two or three year release date difference. Second, the object is to stop the suicidal moon from crashing into the planet. This must be accomplished in three days time. The hours tick away in something like 2 or 3 minutes a piece and days go by far to quickly. Most annoying is the reset function that is built into this time scheme. Everytime you travel in time back to the first day of the cycle, everything you have done, sans the VERY important events, are all reset. So if you time is about to expire and you are in the middle of a quest, too bad, it all gets reset! All in all, not a bad game, but nothing near the original."
3,Confusing,"I bought this game and I thought it was going to be easy. So, I played it for a while. Somehow, I found out about everything, but the only thing that is confusing is which temple to go to or which dungeon do I go. That's why I rather buy the Player's Guide to cheat on this game as soon as I can. That way I will understand the game. I did the same for Ocarina of Time because it was kind of confusing too. So, whenever Zelda comes out with a new game. Buy the Player's Guide, so that you can cheat on the game. I hate to break the code, but it's worth winning the game."
5,Zelda Strikes Again!!!,"there are very few games that have as many awesome sequels as Zelda, and Zelda 6:Majora's Mask is no exception. Incredible graphics,sound,control,and incredible storyline make this an incredible game. What are you waiting for>>BUY IT!!!!"
2,Ocarina of time is 10 times better,Im a huge Zelda fan but this game was a complete dissapointment. first lets talk about the game play. you are sent on a 3 day trip to find a mask taken by a skull kid and you only get a limit of time which is like 1 hour whats up with that I mean just let use play with out worrieing about a time limit. Also by saving you have to find an owl and its a complicated saves process and why cant it be like Orcarina of time when you can save when you want. You cant even be adult Link. When you beat the game you get to use the Majoras mask but theres no point your done with the game. So there has to be one good thing about this game and it fits in a toaster. So go get Orcorina of time and not this
5,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Majora's Mask will be the next hit. You collect masks and when you have different masks you can do different things. If you have a Zora mask you are part of an awesome rock band with a fish guitar. The game style is just like the previous Zelda game.
1,Get your mask on!,This is a fun and exciting game. You collect alot of mask and they let you do something special or change you to a diffrent form. You go to 4 temples to kill the monsters in them. You have three days to beat all of the temples and stop the moon from destroying clock town. You can play a song that alows you to go back in time and keep playing.
1,Reviews by FreaK,"This game is an insult to Zelda fans everywhere. Zelda isn't even in the game, for cryin out loud! Neither is Ganon, who has been in every other Zelda game. Jeez I hope Nintendo's next Zelda game will be better. I don't think it'll be all that wonderful though, the way it is drawn is gonna drive me nutso. If you think otherwise about Majora's Mask, hehe, email me to get my email address! LoL!"
1,you are going to be very disapointed.,if you are expecting a really cool Zelda game you are going to be very disapointed. You just do the same thing over and over and over again. (. . .)
2,This was an awful experience. It feels like one of disney's midquels,"I was fooled by the reviews on Amazon. Majora's Mask has hardly a real sequel at all to Ocarina of Time. It feels like one of disney's new midquels.It's story starts with young Link (um... Nintendo? Link grew up in OOT...) riding through the woods on baby Epona. Which is a problem in itself; how did Link get Epona out of Lon Lon Ranch? Anyway, an imp wearing a mask (Majora's mask) knocks Link out cold, and so the horrible, restraining 3 day cycle begins. Which was not long indeed, soon after collecting my hard-earned items, I would have to go back in time because the clock ran out; this was VERY frustrating for me.I was dissapointed in the fact that this wasn't a real sequel, that Link was not grown up like he was in Ocarina of Time, and that I was fooled by the reviews here. Get Twilight Princess instead; that is the REAL sequel to Ocarina of Time."
3,What can I really say that hasn't been said.,"Why did I give Majora's Mask 3 stars? Well i'll tell you why. Despite the fact it wasn't as good as OOT, and it was lacking a lot, I think I'm just bored. When people say Majora's Mask has very little gameplay compared to OOT'S 2498569428627846 hours or however long it took them to beat it, I present you with this. The first time I played OOT I beat it in 8 hours. Then I did it again. And again. I think you get the point, OOT just got boring. It is still an excellent game however. I think I like Majora's Mask because it is new blood. I don't like having to go back in time or use the owl statues to save, but oh well. The other thing is Koji Kondo didn't do all the music so a lot of the soundtrack came out [bad], but all in all, it is still a fun game for the most part. It is extremely easy, but whatever. It only takes 14 hours to beat because of the HORRIBLY LONG LIFE SUCKING CINEMAS....sorry."
2,"Pretty bad, not nearly as good as the original.","Although Majora's Mask was said to be even better than the original, all the hype of it being ""Zelda Two"" covered up the actual poorness of the game. The three day time element makes the game confusing and difficult. The areas are small and easy to get lost in. There are only four dungons!,! as opposed to the eight in the first Zelda. This game was a disappointment."
4,Majora's Mask Review,"Definitely better than Ocarina of Time. It's an excellent game, but it just doesn't hold the same feel the first three Zelda games had. However, it's highly recommended--it's a lot of fun. ..."
4,Waste of Time,"When I bought this game, I was hoping it would be better than Ocarina of Time.At first, it was more fun, but then you get stuck in the confusion of trying to find all of the masks! After you beat the game, you have nothing to do but find all of the secrets .If your as thorough ,at finding them, as I am, you will miss very few (secrets) the first time.I had ideas on how to find the remaining items and tried them.However, they did not work! I have now learned from a guide that one small item was keeping me from obtaining the rest.There were no clues as to how to find this item given to you by the game.So if you were to find the remaining items, you would have to stumble across them by luck.For people who like adventure games with RPG touches, THIS IS YOUR GAME! If you are an experienced gamer, though, the challange lasts for less than a month; However, I am still recommending this game for everyone .If you want REPLAY VALUE look elsewhere."
2,What a terrible disappointment!,"Wow, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Zelda is my favorite all time series, but this is probably the single worst game I have ever bought. The only reason it gets two stars is because it belongs to the same series as the other games and has the same great interface/engine as OoT. Don't waste your money on this game, just wait until the gamecube one comes out. The gameplay isn't nearly as fun as old games, the time thing gets really annoying--just watch groundhog day instead of playing this game. The plot is incredibly thin and has nothing to do with old games (why even call it Zelda if she's nowhere to be seen, let alone Gannon, the greatest villain of all time). It really goes out with a whimper--the ending is really bad, without a cool final boss or good ending plot cut scene. You aren't missing anything of this great series by skipping this entry--its better left forgotten."
4,A Great Game,"Okay, all I have to say is that this game is way different from any other game. (Or from all the games I played.) I may not be done with the game, but it keeps you on the edge of going further and further. Sure it may be frustrating at times, but when you get the problem solved evrything is cake. It kind of keeps you inn suspense with only three days. Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself... I would highly reccommend this to anyone who just loves to play games. Great Game, great characters, and crazy puzzles!"
5,My Thought,I like this game because it has a lot of excitement in it. I think this game should be highly rated.
5,Majora's Mask,"Although it starts out a little confusing, Majora's Mask is a great game. It has challenging puzzles, cool enemies, and many possibilities, instead of a set path. If you're not a fan of challenging puzzles and maybe running around a little, this game is not for you. But if you are a fan, get it, you won't regret it!"
4,Good game. Too short.,I'd give it 4 and a half but thats not an option. It was a great game and i loved playing it but it was too short. And it isn't really replayable. The graphics and stuff like that were amazing and it was definately worth the 50$ i payed for it. Though I liked it it wasnt as good as Ocarina of time. But if you dont know whether or not to buy it . Do it is a great game.
1,Yet to get my order!,I ordered a game for my son's birthday on Oct 01-over thirty days- and have yet to receive my game. I have been charged and have nothing to show for what I payed. I am now having to spend hours filling out forms and call to try to get my money back. Will never order from this seller again. Would have put 0 stars but that isn't an option.
1,deceptive,"My son was in heaven waiting for this to arrive. When it arrived, he was broken hearted because the game requires an expansion pak to be played. He now has a game that is a paper weight."
4,Ocarina Revisited,"This is a great game. No question about it. Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks to it--namely, that you may feel after you've finished it that you have just played OOT all over again. I understand that Nintendo had to reuse some scenarios to come up with a new game so quickly, but they copied a lot, folks. Pretty much the same cast of characters--Link, the Mask Salesman, Epona, Gorons, Zoras--even little Malon is there, living an alternate life under a different name. Forget all that, though. You'll love it. I promise."
2,[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask],"This is the biggest waste of time and money ever created. The graphics are the same, maybe a little worse, but the gameplay is awful. The story is not as good as it seems, and overhyped. If you have Ocarina of Time, keep playing it, and if you don't, get it. Majora's Mask is not worthy of the Zelda name. If you still are thinking about getting Majora's Mask, rent it and feel proud at the money you saved. I wish I had rented it first."
4,is good but are better games of the estile,is good but so easy the zelda ocarina of time is a lot more hard than the latest version of n64 but have a lot of new things the use of the masks is very original and the detail of the intruments change because of the diferent masks is so good. a Zelda fan the america returner
5,"Legend Of Zelda 2,My review",I have played tons of ZELDA games their all fun but unique in a way like in Ocarnia of Time Link was a ball and all the charactors were the bat so it seems as if he wased pushed around.I would have to say it seems fun.Heres the storyLink is riding through the forest on Epona about 3 months after Ganons defeat.Two fairys come out of no where and startle the horse.Link is thrown off and his lights are knocked out.Then Link wakes up Stalkid is there with Majoras Mask on his face.He finds the Ocarnia and steals it and rides away on Epona.Stalkid is knocked off and runs into another dimension Link follows him on Epona and soon finds out he is in Termina and the moon is falling so Link sets out to save that world.
5,A Word of Caution!,"This is just a warning to everyone out there planning to buy this game, it REQUIRES the N64 Expansion Pack to play. If you don't have it, you can't run this game!!! So you have to buy that too. The product information doesn't mention that anywhere. But hey, if the pics I've seen are any indication, it will be worth the extra money."
5,How... Incredibly... GOOD!,"This game is without a doubt, the greatest Zelda game that ever hit the face of this earth! Ocarina of time was very good as well, but majora's mask was harder, more challenging, and funner than ever. The storyline is excellent. Besides not using swords on Epona (which will be cleared up in the upcoming Zelda Game, Twilight princess), this game gets an A!"
3,An okay game. Great if you like games like it.,"I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I got it. I was hoping it would be somewhat like its Ocarina of Time for N64 but it wasn't that close. There was a lot of intricate details and tasks you need to accomplish in this game and in my opinion it would be nearly impossible without a Video Game Guide that you get at the electronic store. Don't get me wrong here. The graphics and sound were pretty good. Especially considering that it is still on Nintendo 64. But this game isn't like the first and is kind of a disappointment. If you like lengthy games where there is a ton of stuff to do and you have a load of time on your hands, then this game is definitely worth the price. If not, then I would suggest sticking to old Zelda or buying a different game out there."
2,too much effort,i loved zelda:ocarina of time so i was ecstatic when this came out. the problem for me is i found this game to be more effort than fun. you battle time on top of the many tasks that lay before you. the game was ok at first but eventually i got frustrated because there was simply too much going on and it was too much effort and really not much fun. being a deku was cool and all but the novelty wore off and i eventually sold this game without completion. i never left deku stage. too much effort and no fun at all.
2,"Thrown together, quick to beat very tedious!","I would have to say that this game was really just thrown together, probably to get more funds for future projects. It is unlike any other game you have played, which is not always a good thing, because the unique part about this game is you have 72 hours! There is no catch, you have 72 hours, however you do have the song of time to take you back to the starting time. Then, if you do that, you must do everything all over again! It is a very tedious game! You must do the same tasks over and over again! Also, the game was so easy that I was able of beating it in two days upon first playing it! If you are looking for a long challenge, get the other Zelda! This game also requires the N64 Expansion pack, so make sure you have it!"
2,Terrible Follow Up,"Majora's Mask is a terrible follow up to Ocarina Of Time. There are only four levels and they arent very hard. The final battle is stupid because if you get the mask that turns you into an adult Majora is very easy to beat. Also you can only that mask in boss battles which is stupid. This game doesnt take very long to beat. It is a waste of money, do not buy it!"
3,Good but Short,This was a great zelda game but it was too short and it didn't have him growing up like zelda ocarina of time. They should of made it longer but if your looking for a short game this is the one for you.
5,this game is a must,"FOR ALL ZELDA FANS THE TIME HAS CAME AGIAN. THIS GAME YOU CAN TURN INTO A ZORA, A GORON AND A DEKU SCRAB. THIS GAME IS A MUST. SO GRAB YOUR COPY TODAY."
4,Slightly repetative,"I absolutely LOVE this game, but there is one thing I don't like quite as much. Since you only get THREE days, you can't beat the game all in one go. Instead, every single time you want to save you have to play the Song of Time. Sure, that's no problem, but that takes you back to day 1. YOU GO THROUGH THE SAME THING AGAIN AND AGAIN! It's rather anoying, but the game is otherwise AWESOME!"
5,THE BEST RPG EVER,"The legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is one of the best vids ever. Getting the masks are awesome, I love changing into Deku Scrub for flower power and bubble shot. Anyway Majoras's Mask is awesome it is pretty hard a frustrarating but it's an awesome game. I may have used the song of time a million times to beat tha Woodfall temple, but even if you use it that many times i doesn't get boring. I mean lighting those stupid torches with the deku stick can get annoying (and then having to light the cobweb on fire) but everything else is soooooo ccccoooooooollllllll. Although you only get 3 days (n64 time about 72 minutes real time) to do the game, you learn songs such as the song of time that if played backward will slow the pace of time. And others such as the song of soaring are useful to. So if you want a good game get Zelda."
4,Amazing game,In my opinion majoras mask is better than oot(ocarina of time) it is so much harder i love the ability to transform into a Zola and Gordon and deity and deku!
4,Need a strategy guide!!!!,"This game would be really fun if it wasn't so difficult. Luckily, I found a really cheap strategy guide to get me going and now its pretty fun. This game isn't for you if your not patient since if you dont complete something in the 3 days you have on the game you have to start over if your at a temple or something. Unless you really have a lot of free time to wander around on the game, I really suggest you buy a strategy guide. The graphics are probably a 7 1/2 out of 10. Personally, I thought Ocarina of time was way better but how can you beat a game like that?"
3,Monotonous at times.,"I own most all Zelda games and am a true fan since the first. However, this game disappointed me most. It will probably be the one Zelda game I never play a 2nd time. It is very repitious with the whole time change within the 3 day period of which the game is set within."
3,Not as good as the last one,"First, I really like the idea of the time thing. It's a clever concept and it works. The fact that at the end of three days you have to go back and start again is pretty cool. Talking to people at different times in different masks is certainly innovative -- especially for those of us who started with Telstar.That said this game became very monotonous. I used a guide help me complete the game (if you don't have one get one) pretty much the same way I did with the Ocarnia of Time. The difference is while using a guide with the Ocarina only took you to the task and gave you hints on how you could win it frequently took some time to beat a boss. This time there was no real challenge, besides the required patience. And while it took me an entire weekend to beat the final boss in the Ocarnia of Time, I finished this is about a half hour.Visually this is a beautiful and clever game, but if it weren't for those qualities I wouldn't have even given this three stars."
5,BEST VIDEO GAME EVA,This new game rocks. I am a big fan of Zelda when OOT came out that wuz huge but now look at this. WOW. I've already beat the game. It wuz so fun. I recommned everybody to buy this and also but OOT.
5,What are you waiting for ?!,"You have the Nintendo 64 console? You have the Expansion Pack? Obviously you should have a controller, so there isn't any reason why you should wait more time to buy Zelda: Majora's Mask.Zelda is a Classic, so every word I type here wouldn't reach the quality of this Game Series. Especially Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which received 10 out of 10 from many respectable Game reviewers. All of these facts, guarantee that Zelda: Majora's Mask is and will always be a Best Seller for N64.About the technical stuff... The graphics are perfect. Using the Expansion Pack for High-Res 3D scenarios, characters, you certainly won't be disapointed. Sound...well, can't remember any reason why this game would lack of an excellent Soundtrack. Control and Fun Factor certainly will be maitained from Ocarina of Time, so, expect quality.That's it, just buy it and have fun! :)"
5,Link is back with some new and cool twists.,"Link is back in an action packed rpg. Same controls, brand new levels and worlds. When the first zelda came out for n64 i heard it was ok and bought it. when i beat that game i really liked zelda . Now when this game came out i knew i had to have it. my favorite part is turning into different creatures. i think it is an amazing game and would reccomend anyone. it is neat how u start out as a deku shrub. some peoples say its bad but listen its worth it."
4,Majora's Mask,"Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask picks up where Ocarina of Time left off. The game is immense, and challenges the player to really use their mind throughout. There are plenty of puzzles, games, and events that will keep you guessing and very busy. The 72 hour clock feature adds some urgency to the game. Overall, it is very fun, challenging, and will offer hours upon hours of entertainment. There are two downsides to the game that I noticed. First, there were only 4 true dungeons/bosses. I always loved Zelda games for the amount of battle involved. Second, the game relies heavily on mini-games and puzzles to obtain necessary heart pieces. I, myself, gave up on about 7 of the mini-games and finished without those pieces. The more I tried at certain games, the further I didn't get. I personally would rather more dungeon bosses than frustrating games. Overall, I loved the game. Definately play Ocarina of Time first though."
4,It's a good game but the time traveling thing is annoying.,"This is a good game. I enjoyed every bit of it, but the time traveling thing made me mad. I want to know what the people that made this game were thinking when they decited to make the game where you have to time travel. It's annoying Each day lasts about 20 minutes and you have 3 of them. It gets really annoying when you're trying to find something and it's on the third day at night. Then you have to come back after time traveling and get it. The game is nothing compared to Ocarina of Time but it is still a good game. I would reccommend buying it but if you don't like exploring what you've already explored a few times, this game is going to make you mad."
5,Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,"Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is simmilar to Ocarina but instead of youth adult adventures seperated you get a hybrid however with diffenerences the ablity to ride a horse does not apply only to link as an adult also your means of transportation do not render the use of a horse, you may tarvel by foot (fast) or possibly by spiked ball (fun). i don't wish to give away to much so i'll say it is a must have, i rented it and was hooked that's why i'm here lokking for the best deal, it is a MUST have for any nintendo player"
5,Majora's Mask is TIGHT!!!,"This game is really cool! It has all the great aspects of any Zelda RPG game, awesome controls, tons of mini-games to get masks and heart peices and upgrades weapons! There's only five bosses, but you have to defeat them over and over again to really experience what the game has to offer."
3,I'm surprised nobody has mentioned about how scary the moon looks when it's about the crush the Earth.,"I read a lot about the time constraint which is probably the main factor of frustration, but I'm surprised nobody has mentioned about how scary the moon looks when it's about the crush the Earth. It has seriously made me become afraid of abnormally large moons. Maybe for adults but not for kids."
2,2nd worst in the series,"If you want to get this game be warned. It is the shortest game in the series. Only 4 dungeons. I am a big fan of the zelda series but was disapointed with this. The gameplay is there, game length isn't. Once you get familiar with the game it is not hard at all to beat it in under 4 hours. I recomend Ocarina of Time or Link to the Past instead of this. They have long game time to go along with the good gameplay."
3,"Falls Short of the ""Legend""","Briefly, I am a huge fan of all of the Zelda/Link games on N64, SuperNintendo and Gameboy, and have played them all numerous times. So, it was with great excitment that I awaited this new title. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this new adventure. First and foremost, I hate the 3-day time limit for each of the tasks. One of the wonderful things about the previous games was the ability to wander and explore at you own pace, discovering little ""treasures"" all of the place. Unfortunately, you have to run around so much that you don't have time to enjoy the game. I sure hope that the new Gameboy title that is scheduled to be relased soon is better than the N64 title."
4,Zelda,A great game but it doesn't have the zelda magic if you want a good N64 Zelda I would get Ocarina of Time.
3,not as good as the first,"This game was great game, I have to admit it. but not as good as the first. the story line was boring. the days went by to fast. and you lose all the stuff u begin with. then u have to get them all over again. It has great graphics and everything, but what a waste. You didn't even get to find out what the true meaning of the game was, which is! Navi. what happened to her. It would be great if the story went like this. you found Navi, but she was trapped. She was taken by skull kid and you went after her. you were transported to another world to save Navi. Well I gave it 3 stars for graphics and simply the name ZELDA. but the rest was a waste of good potential. don't take my word for it. go ahead buy it. But always remember, the 2nd game in the series is never the best."
4,Easy and hard,It has great graphic's but there is a time limit but the walkthrough is too easy and getting mask is easy but getting fairy is to hard. but the boss is easy if you play the zelda ocania of time. the first game boss was much easier.
2,It's not up to the Hype,"While at first glance, the game seems very similar to Ocarina of Time, once you get into the game, it becomes something more. I would recomend this to anyone."
1,Disappointing,"Right when I heard about this game I knew I would buy it, I wish I hadn't though. Once I got it I really wanted to enjoy it, but It was so boring. The enemy wasn't threatening. The plot (as always) was about as thrilling as an episode of Sesame Street. I used to be a huge fan of the Zelda series, but it is just dull now. There is no actual excitement. I wanted to enjoy this game so badly, but when I got it, it just wasn't any fun, but now that I look at it, none of the Zelda games are able to be intriguing. If you want something good, go for final fantasy. They have interesting storylines, interesting characters (they actually talk!) and what I believe it takes to make a game worth playing. This game made me look at all the other Zelda games differently, I began to realize how dull they all are!"
1,HORIBLE!!,"THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! The best game ever was the legend of zelda ocarana of time. What they did was put everything they loked from ocarana, made it bad, and stuck it in a game with horrible graphics and a sucky plot!!"
4,This is pretty great!,"I think this telescope is pretty great because it has equatorial mount and manufactured by a company that is expert on telescopes (so you can trust it). But it is not so good because of its weight (246 pounds). Equatorial mount is a type of mounting the compensate the Earth's rotation, making the telescope easier to follow the objects in the sky. It's also a reflector, my favorite type of telescope between the two main types of optical telescopes (reflector and relractor). It's excellent for observing very faint objects, such as nubulas. Most refractors cannot observe these faint objects because it's lens absorb precious light. However, reflecters use mirrors and mirrors reflect light instead aborbing it. I recommend this telescope for begininers, intermediate, and between intermediate and experts."
5,"Lovely, fresh, and graceful.","I first heard Malcolm Dalglish and Grey Larsen in a little club in Ohio in the late 1970s, and was a dedicated fan of theirs from then on, up through the time they joined with Pete Sutherland to form Metamora. Then the group split apart, Larsen and Sutherland disappeared, and Dalglish is keeping a very low profile, doing mostly stage shows for children. To this day I don't understand what happened; dueling egos, perhaps? In any case, Dalglish's hammer dulcimer playing is exquisite, and Larsen is an expert on virtually every other instrument known to man. Thunderhead is my favorite of all their albums; their trademark combination of airy grace, sinuous melody and poignant harmonies is, to my mind, heard to better effect here than on any other album they ever made (and their other albums are great!)."
5,Monster cable,I purchased this product to see if it is better then any other cables I have used for my in ear amp. So far it is working much better then any other I have ever used.
5,Great tough cable for bass guitar,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely, but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me, the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality, but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
5,These Cables Are Great!,"These cables give you a pure sound unhindered and uncut. I have several other ""good"" cables but when compared to this they cut highs and even the level. I have grown as a musician to the point that I Know it's worth it to pay a little more for these quality cables. Yes you can get many cables way cheaper (and I'm all for getting things at a good price - publishers clearing house has Not visited me yet!) but this is a case of you get what you pay for!"
5,Overall a pretty dang good cable.,"Really, a good cable is a good cable. I dont really have any complaints when it comes to this cable, it does what its supposed to and the cable has pretty good memory so its fairly quick and easy to coil back up when packing things up. The only thing i was a little bothered with was how stiff the cable seemed to be. It wasn't awfully stiff but i did expect it to be a little more flexible. but really, for the discounted price, you cant beat it."
3,Just ok,"The quality is there, that's for sure. For the most part though Monster is overrated. Very stiff cord and has ""memory"" so it will stay coiled. Not ideal when moving around with a $3k Les Paul."
5,Monter cables are the best,"I use monster cables for allmy guitars, audio and recording. They are the best. If you are going have a $3000.00 gutiar or have top of the line audio. WHy nothave the topof the line cables. What else can I say."
3,Do not use with Telecaster,Bought this as an upgrade over my old rapco cords. It works great with my Les Paul but will not snap into my Telecaster because of the angled end. Wish I hadn't bought the angled.
2,Defective,"I was really excited when I found this for less than $30. I'm a guitar player and I've been in need of a new cable, and I knew that if I wanted something good for gigs that would last me a long time, Monster would be the way to go. It shipped on time and seemed to be in good physical condition, but I wasn't giving me a signal. I tried it out on a few different instruments and machines just to make sure that I wasn't the problem, but the cable was a dud. It's a shame because I really wanted this cable. In it's defense, I bought this used because I'm cheap, but even then, I would still expect it to function like new. I returned it for a full refund. I'm still going to buy this cable, but when I do it will be in person at a local guitar shop."
3,wrong length,"The wrong length was sent to me. Upon calling sender they realized they made a mistake. They were quick to resolve problem. They sent me information via e-mail, on how to send cable back. It took an additional week to recieve correct cable length. Cable works great!!!"
1,Lifetime Warrantee problem,"Monster Cable's lifetime warrantee seems non-existent. If you try their 1-877 phone lines to report a warrantee claim, you will be asked to hold for long periods until you give up. I waited 30 minutes before I gave up. If you try to talk to an operator, you will be asked to re-dial and connect to the warrantee department and then you're back in the long wait. And if you manage to get through they will say their computers are down and you need to call again.This lifetime guarantee is just a cheap marketing trick to get the public think you are getting a product with a lifetime guarantee. I will not fall for this trick making me spend $49 for a 21' guitar cable when I can get a generic one for $15-$20."
1,Monster Cable Breakage,"I have had TWO right angle Monster cables break in less then 1 year since I purchased. I'm extremely careful with my cables (considering the price, wouldn't you be too?) and I'm simply stunned at the breakage. Something comes apart inside the soldered connection and the cable become intermittent, VERY FRUSTRATING! For that kind of money I feel pretty let down."
4,great product,"i go through a lot of guitar cords in a year, these are the best that i have ever used in my studio"
4,Good cable,"This is a pretty good cable, nice sound quality and looks like it will hold up pretty well. It's a pretty good value with other botique cables being $50+"
1,I do not *heart* huckabees,I heart huckabees was by far one of the slowest dullest movie I have seen in a long time. It was hard to follow and very slow moving and just not intresting. Too bad though because it had a wonderful cast. It is about a guy who works for Open Spaces trying to save the enviorment and he goes to the exterstental dective and trys to find out about a coincedence he had. To be honest I did not watch the whole movie. I fell asleep about 45 mins into it because it was not keeping my attention. I tried to watch it again and I again got the very sleepy feeling. But this movie was just not worth my time.
1,Made it through 30 minutes...,"And turned it off. Complete waste of time. The cover says it is laugh out loud funny. Didn't evoke one chuckle from. A wasted cast in a weak movie. Very dissapointing from the person that did Flirting With Disaster and Three Kings. I (heart) Huckabees does not belong in the same category. And I agree with the other reviewer on Jude Laws accent, he was able to hide it as well as Costner in Robin Hood."
2,Entertaining but devoid of content,"I tried really hard to like this movie. I really did. I love the cast, the director's got a good record, and Jon Brion has a habit of making great soundtracks. There were a few chucke-worthy moments, but most of the ""philosophy"" sounds like the writers got stoned and read random selections from ""The Tao of Physics."" Now, I'm definately not knocking the philosophy that they alluded to and hinted at throughout the film, but unless you know what they're talking about already, I would imagine that none of it would make sense. Go pick up some Capra and Jung instead of wasting 107 minutes of suck. Buy the soundtrack instead."
1,Very disappointing,"I had high hopes for this movie, both because of the stars and because I enjoy the off-the-beaten path movies. Another reviewer mentioned BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, IGBY GOES DOWN, THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS and ADAPTATION, and I love all those movies, but I couldn't stand this one and couldn't wait for it to be over. The only reason I kept watching was the vain hope that a twist at the end would tie it all together/make it all work but it didn't.I didn't like most of the characters (couldn't empathize, just didn't care about), and the plot felt like ""Let's make it weird for weird's sake"". As much as I love a movie where I don't see the ending coming, I also like it to at least make some vague sense, and this just totally didn't do it for me."
5,It is what you want choose to make it,"I enjoyed this movie because it didn't give you an absolute answer as on how to view what life is all about. The characters were shown options and, based on their life experiences, they filter through everything and then decide on some hint of reason or belief for their existence. To me, the disjointedness other reviewers reference is not a negative but a metaphor for the confusion/chaos we experience living where all is maybe nothing and nothing is maybe something but who's to know for certain when we don't even know for certain who we are.This is a movie for people who like to ponder. I didn't understand everything but I intend to watch it again and again because I am certain to learn something new about myself each time I do."
4,Funny but maybe difficult,"This comedy is about existential life; this should scare away a lot of viewers already. It is funny, but not haha funny. Another part of the audience gone.If you are still with the movie after about 15 minutes you will like it. You are probably already a fan of all the Wes Anderson films. It does remind you a litle of 'Rushmore' which also starred Jason Schwartmann. In that way it's an intellectual comedy.The acting is good. Schwartmann seems to reprise his Max Fisher role from Rushmore, but now older but still quirky. Jude Law is good as a slick yuppi. Best of the film is Dustin Hoffman though as the 'therapist' in a great duo with his wife played by Lily Tomlin.I loved it."
1,I don't heart this movie,"Its like that jason schwartzman tv show that was on a few years ago but the movie form, its like having your teeth pulled while being waterboarded."
4,Funny...funny,I don't get some of the jokes because I was an English major but I got some of them. This movie could be better but it's good enough to rent or even buy. Marky Mark is really good in it. I didn't realize a deep man could reside underneath such eye candy.
5,Loved this movie!,"It was hilarious, fascinating, and insane. Gotta be the right kind of person to enjoy it I would expect though!"
1,zero stars,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I normally enjoy different movies, but no one I was with on two times I tried to watch this could make it through even 1/2 of the movie without giving up. It's that terrible."
1,I want my 107 minutes back,This movie is now on my list of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Another reviewer mentioned plot. There is no plot. Just alot of talking psycho babble. I kept watching only in hopes that a clever twist would appear. It never did. Not one nanosecond made any sense.
1,I HATE Huckabee's!,"What a waste of talent. This stinker is the most boring, nonfunny ""comedy"" I have seen in many years. I warn you, do not subject yourself to this rubbish. Even worse than THE LIFE AQUATIC! Although, when a movie gets to that level of worthlessness, it is kind of hard to pick between them."
1,Um.......,"Bizzare, bizzare, bizzare. I think the movie review book 'Baked Potatoes' stated it best with, ""get stoned and write your movie, DO NOT get stoned and MAKE your movie."" I HEART HUCKABEES goes nowhere."
2,Not a successful satire,"I understand that was intended to be satirical and most definitely *not* a rehash of the philosophy classes most of us have taken in high school or college, but it just didn't work for me. I kept checking to see when it would end, and the minutes ticked far too slowly.It just wasn't funny enough to be a successful satire. I laughed perhaps three times, and they were only chuckles. I'm not an ignorant person. I've studied philosophy (thought of taking it up as a minor in undergrad), so I understood what they were trying to do. But...well...I guess I'm just repeating myself here, so there's not much more I can say other than it wasn't funny enough, and that it didn't work for me.I can see how it worked for other people, and I don't begrudge their appreciation. Everyone has different tastes."
1,people that like this movie want to be unique,"this movie was terrible because the charactors were boring, no one relates to them, and the story line is insane. after the movie was over i turned to my friend and asked her what the big hype was over the movie and she didnt know either. another user compared the movie to THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS, but i dont see it. the royal tennebaums has a great story line and is tasteful when it comes to being wierd, whereas this movie does not. i couldnt stand this movie and i will never watch it again. i finished in hopes of the mess of events to come together and make sense somehow but it didnt."
1,maybe you don't agree with my opinion....,"....but I wasn't a fan of this movie.Perhaps if you're neck deep into philosophy and psychology on a day-to-day basis you'll relate to this movies and have a few laughs. However, as someone who took Philosophy 101 and Psych 101, I still thought the jokes were too off the wall to count as humour. It IS funny to make fun of existentialist theories and general concepts, but it was overdone and tedious. I'd heard this movie was amazing, but in my opinion, this movie is NOT amazing, but it's truly amazing that I watched the entire film and even more amazing that so many big stars agreed to do this one."
2,Meandering psycho-babble,"Yet another underwhelming offering from David O Russel on another uninteresting subject, this time existentialism. While all of the cast are excellent the movie itself is full of fortune cookie philosophy and metaphysics. It comes off as Russells personal sandbox where two competing philosphies duke it out only to cancel each other out at the end, changing essentially nothing. It tries to dazzle you with drive-by philosophy and kooky characters but ultimately is just a meandering mix of slightly connected scenes that drag you along to the end."
1,big disspointment,"I guess at some point I should get used to these kinds of movies where the story that the movie should be about disspears and is replaced by some lame distraction in which someone can spew thier pseudo-intillectual crap for an hour and a half. This time it's existential detectives.Oh, and at the end they discover that the problem with Jude Law and Naomi Watt's is they're not having good sex. OH how amazingly original!"
2,"Philosophy, Hollywood style...","Pompous, grotesque ""comedy"" that gives away just how condescending and facile the denizens of The Land Of Make Believe truly are. A sloppy treatise on existentialism where none of the characters deserve anyone's sympathy or attention. If the writers gave half a fig about what they were writing about, this might have been an entertaining film. But the film is content instead to wallow in its own ill-considered cleverness in the hopes of blowing away a dimwitted, half-educated film audience who thinks that anything that smacks of intellectuality is to be praised simply because it is ""heavy"". This film will quickly bring to mind another obnoxious, self congratulating slab of intellectual posturing called ""Being John Malkovich"", and depending on who you are, that might be a bad or good thing."
1,This stinks,"I watched the first 45 minutes as things grow increasingly absurd, but the more the plot struggles, the more unfunny it all seems. I didn't laugh in the slightest at anything going on here. A waste of talents, and Jason Schwartzman plays the identical character in 'The Darjeeling Limited.' Lilly Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman add zilch. A real dog."
3,Decent dvd quality,This dvd was in fairly good condition for being used but I did not keep it. I would probably buy from this seller again if they had a movie that I wanted.
1,Really annoying,"In this movie, Jason Schwartzman's character seeks the aid of exerstentialist detectives to discover why he keeps meeting an African man in a variety of different places. If you are like me, then you are probably already lost by now. The movie just gets more confusing from there. I guess that the makers of these movie were going for a comedy but it is more like a really annoying melodrama. None of the characters in the movie are particular interesting and the plot is just so stupid.I guess that the movie is kind of absurdist humor in the line of plays like Waiting for Godot or Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead, and books like Catch-22. I really can't say that I am a fan of absurdist humor because I just find it rather plotless and too annoying. If you like absurdist humor then maybe this movie is for you. If you find that kind of stuff annoying, then I would suggest that you skip this one."
4,Thoughtful and funny,"I really enjoyed this film, butI have to agree with the person who says this might not be for everyone. It may seem confusing at times. In any case, the performances are strong and funny, especially by Hoffman, Tomlin, and Wahlberg. At the least, it may give you some questions about the universe to think about in a new way."
2,It's different....and that's all that has going for it,"Since I liked Adaptation and Being John Malkovich, I was interested in seeing this movie. But whereas those movies had real wit and depth, I 'heart' Huckabees just seemed like it was playing games with the viewer and was simply quirky without anyting really interesting to say. Since some viewers rate this an all-timer, there must be something to ""get""......I just didn't."
2,Dumbest Movie Ever,"This movie was absolutely horrible. A complete wasted of time!!! THe only reason I gave it two stars is b/c the actors did a good job, but it was completely ruined by the story line. It didnt even make any sense..............absolutely terrible.......what a dissapointment"
5,Hilarious!,"This is a hilarious movie. I see that alot of people say that this movie is not for everyone, and that some people have expressed very negative opinions about it. I found that the negative reviews betrayed a complete lack of understanding and insight and it seemed to me apposite that such witless turds could not appreciate this movie."
1,Emperor's new clothes,"This is one of the few films I have ever stopped playing without viewing til the end credits. It is self indulgent twaddle that appeals to those who think they must see something in it because other pseudo intellectuals and professional ""critics"" think its cool and edgy. Well, like the kid in the story of the Emperor's new clothes, I deem this film utter garbage and one not worthy of even being in the bargain bin!"
1,shallowness feigning depth,"i would give it a zero, but i can't.this movie was utterly stupid, not funny at all and not even a hundredth as deep as it pretends to be. the premise is stupid, the characters are stupid, the squares that break off of dustin hoffman's face and float around when he's talking existential b.s. are stupid and annoying.i wanted to leave the theater within ten minutes of the start, but stuck it out, to my own dismay. it only got worse.don't fool yourself. there is nothing profound about anything in i heart huckabees...it's shallowness feigning depth. and yes, i ""got it."" it just totally sucked.the only slightly redeeming thing about this movie was watching marky mark hit himself in the head with a ball...it pretty much mirrored how i felt at that point."
1,NOR THEN OR WHEN,"how am i not you, mother has persperation but is dead inside a room already. don't expect a fortune teller to come louise from the other one of the rooms. dianne or betty is another move. come on now. take the apostraphe to new the end then."
2,not so great,"I really wanted to like this. It has a good reputation and, at least going by descriptions of it, was my kind of movie: a philosophical film.Unfortunately, despite his reported assurance on the set, I don't believe the director knew what he wanted to do with the material. The idea of a couple of philosophical detectives working to get to the bottom of a client's life was definitely promising material, but the whole thing was swamped by pretentiousness.Heck, the idea of a firefighter completely giving up on his life until he got some answers to philosphical questions was enough to carry this movie: they should have dialed down all the philosophy and ramped up the comedy. It would have made what philosphy there was much more powerful and memorable. As it is, it just seemed like too much, too fast."
2,"Wonderful Idea, Badly Executed","The plot sounded so interesting, and I thought I would love this movie by the previews. But lack of depth from some of the main characters and a script missing definite purpose was just frustrating. I kept waiting for more from Jason Schwartzman, but I think it was the script that left me feeling coldest. Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin were absolutely great, and definitely the highlight of this film (for me). Anyone interested in this film should rent it before buying, because it was not nearly as good as I thought it would be."
3,I did NOT Heart Huckabees!,"This movie disappointed me. I loved ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Being John Malkovich,"" and I was told that ""I Heart Huckabees"" was another offbeat film that I would absolutely love. Well, I didn't love it, and I didn't even LIKE it all that much. ""Huckabees"" boasts an impressive cast and some interesting existential philospophies, but those ideas just don't translate well to the big screen. I know a lot of people who have seen this movie and absolutely love it, but it just wasn't for me. It's a very ""messy"" movie, and I just couldn't get past that. If you're looking for an artistic comedy that's out of the mainstream, rent ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" instead,"
1,What was the point!?,This movie was just horrible! I had very high hopes for it and watched the first 6 or 7 minutes with great gusto...then it started dragging on and on...this was just awful. All the characters were just boring to watch and the story was pretty cheesy. I suggest spending money elsewhere....
1,Yawn..... Is this supposed to be funny?????,"I tend to like qwirky comedies such as Rushmore and Tennenbaums. This movie tries really hard to be the same caliber of movie but it fails miserably. I couldn't believe how boring this movie was. I watched most of it, and then I was going to shut it off until I realized that there was only about 15 minutes left. Let me tell you, my friend, that was the LONGEST 15 minutes of my life. (well maybe not) This movie is not funny and it is not even entertaining enough to keep you from falling asleep. I would recommend Garden State which is a much better movie all around."
3,Good...if you think about that kind of stuff,"This film is good if you ""think"" about everything too much. If you are constantly trying to find the ""meaning"" and ""connection"" to something/everything in life.If you just go about your day NOT putting too much thought into life......well...you just won't relate or connect to this movie at all. You will probably get annoyed by it.I'll give it 3 stars."
4,An attractive and useful little book,"It's well written and appealing, and it certainly makes you want to visit Turin. It has excellent information about museums and other cultural destinations, though less tourist detail than other guides."
1,Looks like an illegal copy,"I know Amazon cant help it that sometimes very bad quality slips through, and even Ms Donna Summer let this bad copied DVD go to the stores. What a bummer this one is, it's just the very good originalVH1 Presents: Live & More Encore!badly copied, don't buy this DVD, and please Amazon throw all the left ones in the bin"
1,Terrible!!! I was robbed!!!,"This is just a very, very bad copy of the Donna Concert Live and More Encore... BAD RESOLUTION... BAD COPY... Where is the FBI? I'm too far to do anything, but this is a warning for all the Donna Summer fans who can be attracted to this fake... I don't know how can Amazon permit this...Disco Queen"
5,Balanced and sympathetic,"Compton focuses on the devotion and inner lives of women involved directly with the development of polygamous marriage within Mormon theology.I found the stories of these women absolutely amazing. Regardless of where you stand in relation to the theology, their individual biographies reveal interesting, sincere women.Given the potential controversy of this book, the author is always careful to explain the available data. In areas of conflicting reports, he presents all available data, and leaves judgment to the reader.If you are interested in early Mormon polygamy, and the philosophy/theology behind it, this book is the mother lode."
1,This book can be damaging!,"My brother who had a shakey testimony to begin with -- who lost his son when he was only 2 years old and since has questioned the divinity of the church, has been introduced to a few ""anti mormon"" books in the last few years. This one is one of them and after he read this, he is now more lost than ever. If you don't know and understand your religion as a Mormon and have a deep understanding and an established testimony, this book can decieve and plant seeds of doubt and can really cause you problems. I don't recommend reading this. I feel great sorry for my brother. I hope that someday something can happen to him so that he can get the big picture and not be so mislead by those who wish to do just that!"
2,"A few Interesting Facts, but a Bad Premise.","The author of this book started out with a premise: Men having more than one wife (polygamy, plural marriage) is a bad thing. He then created a dark and depressing book to support the premise. A couple of scholarly reviews have been written which place the book in proper perspective.The book could have been a really good one without this fatal flaw. But it is a huge one and it is fatal. Editor, All About Mormons web site."
3,Way too long,"Unlike books like The Making of the Atomic bomb (in which the length is worth the read) this book was just plain TMI---too much information.I believe the same objective could have been achieved in a lot fewer pages. Quite frankly, after only a few chapters, I felt as though i had read it all before.I think it is an interesting read if you have a lot of time and don't mind reading one tale after another about this man's prediliction for young women.The book begins with an introduction of all the wives, and then details each one's relationship to Joseph Smith one at a time. The book is fascinating in that one can hardly believe that such a perverted man could actually convince people he was a prophet. It is certainly a must read for those who have had some experience with the Mormon cult."
3,Reality shock,How can so many people be so blind about the ridiculous rantings of a fool such as Joseph Smith? WAKE UP PEOPLE!
4,Needed to be read,What an eye-opener about real LDS history and the struggles of these women. I almost feel like I am there while reading these words. Enjoy!
5,Valuable and Great Perspective,"Compton has done amazing and unique work by telling the story of polygamy through the eyes of each one of the 33 women who were married to Joseph while he was alive. He follows their lives from birth to death, including their conversion to the church, their marriage with Joseph, and their lives after Joseph's death. Compton's tone is unapologetic and it is clear he laments the pain these women went through, but he is also a believing Mormon; he deals with the contradiction in an honest and frank manner. ""Thirty-three extraordinary lives began with promise and devotion and ended almost uniformly in loneliness. The great consolation these women held was that their sacrifices had been for God. Whatever reward they received, it was not of this world."" This is a book anyone who wants to understand polygamy should read. Mormons will be challenged by it, but will find a more realistic grounding for their faith in early church leaders."
2,No station tuning,"I know nobody buys this product for its radio. But I listen to radio, and I got stuck with it when I bought a used car. The fact that you can't actually tune to radio stations is soooooo irritating. You can use the seek feature, but it only stops at local stations. A 50,000-watt flamethrowing FM 50 miles away... forget it. So in order to set the station, I'll have to drive maybe 25 miles to get signal this weak receiver actually reads, then program it in the presets. And then if I have to change batteries, etc., I'll have to do it again. Way to go JVC!"
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY! save your $$,"I was excited to get these flats and I had outfits already planned for their arrival. When I opened the box I found them to be of the cheapest quality material, and the metallic paint was SPRAYPAINTED on!! It flaked off the second that I took them out of the box and made a mess on my table. The toes and bow were already scratched up from the shipping, and that was inside of a box so just imagine what one day of wearing them would do! I am returning them today and getting a full refund.These shoes are cute in the picture, but don't be fooled, they are of the worst quality! Dont waste your money."
3,"some good detail, but poor writing.","This was a short overview look at the Solomons campaign. The writitng style was amatuerish and could have used an editor. It reads like a undergraduate term paper. Two of the maps were transposed as well. Still, it provides a good introduction to the campaign. Wilmott's 'The War with Japan' was a better history, but did not offer as much specific detail on this campaign."
2,not the game i like,"At fisrt, I thought this game was quite good. Not bad graphics & storylines.I didn't know how sad it really was! After literally a day, i got so bored with it, i dared not look at it. It was slow, hard, and in my opinion, gave Tomb Raider's good reputation a bad name. For the 1st 3 levels óf th game, you're forever stuck in greek side streets, then when u actually get out, it gets much harder & just as boring. Considering it's the last Tomb Raider, i think they could of made big improvements. Nothing compared to Tomb Raider: Last Revelation"
4,TR Chronicles,"This game is very good. One of my favs. There are some good levels on it. The Black Isle levels are different, though, because you don't have any weapons. The graphics are alright. The few problems with it are that some of the puzzles are kind of diffucult, like the swinging thing at the end of the Black Isle levels. I havn't been able to get past there yet,(I used cheats to get to the last levels of the game if your wondering). Also, the part in the first level of the last story where you have to get down the rope/wire/bar thing before the fire stuff explodes and kills you...just tell me one thing...how is anyone suppose to know that that room is back there and that ya gotta back flip into it, Common! Also you don't have the level editor in the PS version, only in the PC version. Still it's a good game. I recommend it."
1,they all stink,i hate tomb raider the plot is sooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid you dont even get to do enything but i think this is so stupid ireally hate tr cronicles and all the other ones
5,It got here fast...,So I ordered this box set yesterday the 2nd and I got it today the 3rd of October. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Now I can introduce the Anime to my friends. I won't give a plot outline because its been done already. It was received in good shape with nothing bent or missing.
2,Good but i havnt gotten it yet,"I know that this is the first season, which starts off the whole Bleach series which is why i bought it; however, i have not gotten it and it has been over a month since i ordered it. I have looked and i am apparently not the only customer to have this problem. Hopefully Amazon can hurry up with my order because i also ordered 2-7 the same day and got those within reasonable time. Good Series.. Just should not have to wait."
5,good show,my uncle just got into bleach and I started watching it with him so for Christmas I got him this box set he must like it because now he wants season two
5,A Must Have for any serious Anime Lover,I'm quite new to the anime world so to speak and I stayed at the movies recently to view a Bleach movie and was quite surprised at the turn out [SOLD OUT].The advances in computer softeware has brought anime to a whole NEW level. I recently purchased Appleseed and was blown away by the quality. I just read up on this series and it's now in it's 8 season on the air in Japan.This series is a MUST HAVE in anyone's collection.
3,Bleach season 1,There are 4 free disc holders that are held by tape and attached to the 5th disc holder and was completely tore causing me to get the same type of tape to fix it.
1,I want me order,I ordered this item almost a month ago and I still haven't gotten it. I'm very unhappy with the service of this order! Why is it taking so long? And why dose the shipment speed keep changing. I love amazon but this might change my mind about how often I order anything from this company. :(:(
2,Just average,"This anime is just a bunch of conventions of the genre put together.The hero who shows a ""don't care attitude"", but in reality want to protect everyone. He got this hidden power that makes him kinda of invincible, meaning that you will never fear for his life since you know he will always win, no matter how strong is the enemy.Besides the pacing of the series is constantly interrupted but little side stories that adds nothing to the overall plot and are really boring.The action so far have nothing special to it, since the animation is just average, and all the main caracter can do is swing his sword with no technic (which is understandable since he just got his powers, but still..).But i have to admit that this anime have style. All the caracters have great designs, with a lot personality in it. Before looking out for Bleach I recomend you to see YU YU Hakusho, which have a similar concept but is infinitely superior."
3,Bleach Uncut Season 1 Box Set (standard Edition),"I'm a big fan of Naruto. I thought Bleach was also worth watching. First, I didn't really understand what's going on in the show. Second I don't like Ichigo. Since the price became reasonable to get it, so I did. But I'm not sure I'm getting Season 2."
3,"Great anime, but don't go for English dubbed versions","A lot has been written about the anime and the manga. So I'll be brief: Bleach is great! It is one of my favorites.Then why just the three stars?I do believe that payed downloads are a great space and time saving alternative to DVDs, but I wouldn't go for these because they are dubbed.A lot of depth goes lost in the english translation. For example, in Japanese language the choice of specific words reveal status and relationships. Just watching the english dubbed trailer, gave me the feeling that I am missing things. I would recommend watching the DVD's with the subtitles."
5,Great Show!,"Bleach is a fantastic show, no doubt about it, and this set features many great episodes. By the time you finish this season, you're hooked into the storyline and anxious to watch season 2. The packaging and presentation of the DVD is pretty well put together and looks nice. As far as extra's are concerned, there's a pretty good 20 minute video with interviews from the English Voice actors, some promos, art gallery, the option of having the original Japanese audio with subs, etc. The DVD is fairly priced and should make a fine addition to any collection."
4,Don't get ripped off...,Every seller has this item at $100 to $250. don't get ripped off. You can buy this product at walmart RIGHT NOW for around $35.. I just saw it there lastnight.
4,A good learning game,"I wasn't sure how this would be accepted but my five-year-old not only enjoyed it but showed a far better understanding of the game -- and the math involved, than I expected. We did get the Junior Tiles to go with it."
3,Thinking Game,I noticed the game seemed a little more complicating and advanced for the younger age range listed on the game. The game really makes you think so it took awhile to finish games. I guess that is how much thinking games are until you start thinking quickly like the game is made for. Great learning game though but younger kids lost interest because frustrating.
2,It's just not very fun,"It took about 4 turns and 20 minutes before we gave up on this game. It's just not that fun, and we're all people who are comfortable with math. Perhaps it is useful as an educational tool, but it is not a fun game. It felt very contrived and at the end was unsatisfying."
2,Petoskey Grandma,"I purchased this game for our grandchildren, ages 9 and 10. When I opened the box, I was disappointed at the quality of the tiles (pressed board) and the tile holders (a flimsy plastic). I had expected something like Scrabble, with nice tiles and wood tile holders. Nonetheless, we read the starting directions and started a game. We both found it to be difficult, especially if you happen to pick several tiles with fractions of different denominators. I am sorry I purchased this item, and would advise others to think twice before ordering it.Equate: The Equation Thinking Game"
2,Maybe if you're a math teacher or home schooler...,"But we are neither. We tried playing this with our 10 and 9 year old and they couldn't even get through one game. So although I'm sure it's great for some families, ours didn't get much use, and hence, not much educational value, out of it."
2,"Great idea, but","We played the game with gifted kids and adults age 9-40-plus and were surprised to find the kids were able to hold their own. But, like scrabble, the turns take forever! And, the scrabble concept doesn't really work well with the operators (=.+,-); too soon you run out of space on the sides as equations are much longer than words. You can't put two equations as close as two words and so there is much less opportunity for creativity in placing your pieces (e.g. you cannot make two equations in two directions; sometimes there are only one or two locations where it is possible to add an equation). We were getting scores of 10-30 points per turn, then one person added the following to an existing equation ""0 X 34567 5/6 +."" By hitting a triple equation score and got more than 270 points on one hand thereby effectively ending the game that had been relatively even. It seemed unfair even to him! Great idea flawed by long waits and poor design; unlikely to play it twice. C"
4,Math Fun,"I hate math, but this game is fun.I remember improving my spelling and vocabulary with Scrabble. I was hoping this would do the same with math for my daughter. So far, so good. It's given my daughter great self-confidence in Math. She was doing division with fractions in the game, which she hasn't learned yet in school.Only complaint:The tiles are cardboard and thin. Easy to lose, but they come in a ziploc type bag."
4,Best math game for 2nd-4th graders,"About as educational as you can get for 2nd-4th grade. One of the few ways to brush up on math skills with my 7 yrs old outside the evening homework. Once scoring is done, will work together trying to use up all of the tiles filling the board out. With the expansion packs you increase the challenges as skills develop.Having purchased many boardgames I would say quality is above average and exceeded my expectations."
3,Just ok...,"Product came as ordered, but is not of particularly good quality. It meets our needs, but the step portion wiggles a bit and I don't think it's sturdy enough to use as a step stool for the child when they are older, as some nursing stools are. Also, the adjust ability is mediocre. I find the lowest setting is too slanted, but the other two settings are too flat. I think there is a possibility of a child pinching a finger in the adjustment holes since there is no way of locking it in place, and all it takes to adjust it is to lift the platform with your toe (convenient, but I will be putting it away if our son starts showing an interest in it as a toy). It would be better if it even just clicked into place, or had slightly smaller notches for the adjustable parts. It works for now, and I guess I got what I paid for, but I would not recommend this item to a friend."
4,Bought One for HOME and WORK!,"Very helpful product! I bought two, one for our home and one for my wife's office. She used to prop her feet and ankles up during second and third trimester of pregnancy. Very easy to assemble!"
3,slips all over the place,"This stool would be just fine if the stick-on pads that came with it stayed on the feet. They didn't really do a good job in the first place, but now the stool slips away from me with the slightest pressure from my feet, whether on carpet or wood floor. It needs better non-skid pads on the bottom."
3,Espresso Looks Like Cherry to Me,"This is a good quality stool but the color is all wrong. I purchased the espresso finish to go with my espresso rocking chair and the finish (even though marked espresso on the box) is most definitely cherry. It has a very distinct red tint to it. Debating whether to send it back, but I really need it and it took a long time to arrive."
4,Handy Helper,"The Kidkraft adjustable nursing stool is a handy helper for nursing and for when you need a little boost to reach things. The stool is very sturdy and easy to put together. The honey color is attractive. The stool has three adjustable levels however, the adjustment options angle the stool rather than raising or lowering the stool height in an even way. I bought this stool for nursing and would prefer that that stool be adjustable in a level way rather than at an angle. Overall, this is a nice, helpful product."
4,Good Buy,"bought this for my girl while she was pregnant to put under her desk at work. She continues to use it while feeding. Quality is pretty good, just don't use it as a stepping stool."
2,"paint chips, not worth it.","i bought this and though it is a good stool for nursing, it is made out of soft wood and not stained, it is painted the cherry color, which at the slightest bump scratches off to reveal ugly splotches of white underneath.I thought that for the $35 i paid i would at least get a decent quality wood and stain, a piece of furniture that i could keep for years. but it's junk.next time i will stick to the cheaper nursing stools"
5,"great product, nicely made","I must confess I haven't put this to the test yet (still waiting for baby to arrive) but it was easy to assemble and well made, seems like it will stand up to lots of use. I love that it's adjustable and anticipate it being very helpful for avoiding back/hip pain when I'm nursing :)"
5,Happy with this product,"This stool was easy to put together (did it myself 8 mths preg), sturdy, very good quality, visually very nice and I use it everyday. What more is there to say? Very nice and I recommend it."
4,Very good quality.,The quality and finish on the stool is great. We really like the way it looks in our baby's room. We use it with a glider because a friend recommend a stool like this over the expensive gliding ottoman. I think it was a good choice and saved us some money. My wife's only complaint about the stool is that it is a little slippery when she is wearing socks.
2,"Good positioning, but bad on hardwood","The non-skid pads on the bottom came off within a week on hardwood floors, so you'll need to get some that stick better, use stronger glue, or screw in."
3,Broke in first year,"All but one of the pegs attaching the foot platform to the sides (the pegs you would situate in a slot to change the angle) fell out within the first 6 months, got lost under couches or somewhere, and now the stool is effectively not a stool but a piece of wood and two arches. Useless. Disappointed since the price implied quality. Never seemed that durable - wouldn't always stay in position if jostled."
4,"Solid, functional, recommended.","Not perfect, but a very good option at a nice price. The pegs on this footstool are what keep it from 5 stars - not only has one continually popped out (requiring some glue) but they also rattle around a bit. What this means is that when you're using it in the middle of the night, rocking in your chair, it creaks and makes enough noise to wake your baby. Which isn't great. But ... an easy solution is to wrap each peg with soft material (I used some velcro strips) so it fits more snugly in the grooves. More snug + soft material = no creaks = sleeping baby.I'd buy it again, just be sure to wrap those pegs before you wake the baby."
3,"Clickety Clack, Clickety Clack","That's the sound this stool makes when you push off the angled position.I chose it for its simple, clean design - and in that regard it doesn't disappoint. But the sound is just downright annoying. I try to keep my feet on the frame of the stool to avoid it. I should stick some of those foam adhesive pads between the top piece and frame to eliminate the noise (Siri, add that to my to-do list).PS> Not sure why this is classified in the toy category? Odd."
5,KidKraft Adjustable Stool Espresso,"Arrived quickly, was easy to put together and the quality looks very nice and matches my other espresso furniture very nicely. I have Berber carpeting, so the stand does not slip at all. I would definitely recommend to others."
5,My wife is happy,"My wife is very happy. I had a pile of boards for her to put her feet on at one point, but now we have this fancy little foot stool."
4,Comfortable.,"The angle does make sitting and nursing or bottle feeding much more comfortable. My daughter really likes this. Watch out for the pegs, they WILL come out. Once you put it together, save yourself a whole lot of headaches and just Crazy Glue the pegs into place to they don't. Yes, it does slide out from under your feet due to the angle of your feet pushing it. I have it on carpet, but it still slides somewhat. I guess just put rubber feet on the bottom, but I haven't been bothered enough by it yet to go that root."
3,"OK, but a little overpriced","I have been using this stool at work for about a month now to try and keep my legs from swelling so much while pregnant. One of the wooden dowels that is used to adjust the angle of the stool has come loose and falls out every so often. I plan on using wood glue eventually to fix that issue. Since I use it at work, I am wearing rubber sole tennies and the finish has already worn off the front edge. The anti slip pads on the bottom have fallen off already too, as other reviewers have noted. If it were half the price, I would have rated it higher, but at this price and the issues I've had, it seems overpriced and not really worth it."
2,honey is not honey,bought this as i needed a nursing stool...bought the honey to match our nursery collection which ishoney colored...well when i got it in the mail...i was very disappointed to find it a pee color not honey.
2,Mediocre Film,"This film consists of news clips, random war footage, reenactments, and news anchors giving their opinions about Zarqawi. Nothing hard hitting, like footage of special forces hunting him, or footage of a news anchor embedded with the special forces. It just seems sloppily put together to fill up space on the Discovery channel (it's 40 minutes long, has commercial breaks, etc.)"
4,It seemed too short,"This DVD accurately portrays Zarqawi as a thug who ""got religion"" and became a Jihadist, moving his operation to Iraq and attacking fellow Muslims as well as the occasional Coalition Soldier. It portrays the attacks on the Shi'ites as both a religiously-motivated ""holy war"" and as part of a long-term strategy to trigger a civil war in Iraq, a war which the Coalition would quit in disgust and which would leave al-Qaeda in control, much the same lines as Afghanistan. This is dead on.While doing this it does not perpetuate the myth that Zarqawi was Palestinian (he was a Jordanian who grew up in a Palestinian neighborhood). If anything is lacking it is a a discussion of Zarqawi's influences in prison and some of the attacks he almost certainly perpetrated in Jordan in an attempt to ""widen the war."""
2,Way below Nora's usual standard,"I ordered this book after reading all of the high praise here, but I just can't agree with them. The one thing that I've loved about all of Nora's books is that there is always one part of the characters that you can identify with. They're human, they're believable, and you care what happens to them. And that's what I found lacking in these stories. I found the characters dull and boring, sometimes even laughable (Night Shadow with its Batman-like figure). The stories were tedious and predictible (the last one being the best of the lot). Since they are by Nora Roberts, Night Tales is of better quality than most romance novels out there, but I've been spoiled by her better efforts. Skip this collection and go straight to Night Shield.A few reviewers mentioned that these resembled the J.D. Robb books. I've never cared for those (too dark) which is probably why I didn't like these."
2,The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web,"Garrett clearly states that his aim is to articulate his vision that was captured in his sketch of the elements of user centered design for the web ([...]). He certainly accomplished this, but he did not go any further than that. For this reason I would only recommend this book to someone who is looking for a cursory reference on how to break down the layers of web development incorporating user centered design principles.This book might complimentCall to Actionsince Call to Action is less structured, but driven more by tangible examples.I hesitate to recommendUsability for the Webonly because I haven't finished reading it. But so far it is extremely well written, detailed, and well structured. I suspect for someone looking for a thorough 432 page book rather than a cursory 174 page book, Usability for the Web will be the preferred alternative."
5,A must have for anyone that plans to make stuff people will use,"While the focus is on web design much of the value of this book is presenting a framework for thinking about design. It's really applicable to designing any product. This isn't a set of specific techniques or hand holding you through designing your web site. Rather, it's a survey of how visual artists, interaction designers, engineers, managers, marketing, and other experts come together to create. While this book does give brief summaries of different areas of knowledge useful to designing web sites and software, that isn't the main point. It assumes you are either an expert in one of these fields or have access to one on your team."
3,Truly and INTRODUCTION to User Experience,"As a professional in the UX industry, I found this book to be incredibly elementary and I did not really ""learn"" that much from the book. HOWEVER, I am not discounting the book's content. If you are a Business Analyst or someone new in the field, there can be a lot gained from this book.It is a short, quick read with plenty of illustrations and a decent typeface size. From my perspective, it gets 3 stars. But if you are truly new to this, I could see it getting 4.5."
4,user experience,This is a really good book. Sometimes with texts of this type you can get really bogged down with the terminology and the theory of it and really lose sight of exactally what you are discussing. This book keeps it short and to the point. Its easy for a beginner to understand but not to simple that a more experienced designer gets bored. I would definately recommend it for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of design interfaces with the user experience in mind.
3,Good book to develop a user-centered website,"I bought this book to write one chapter of my thesis about Experience Design. I didn't find it very useful (but my objective was academic). Basically this is a book about one process of making webdesign using an user-centered approach (a very good process in my point of view). Another interesting aspect is how the author situates the discipline ""Experience Design"" in relation to other disciplines like Interaction Design, Information Arquitecture, Usability, etc...I give it three stars because there are better books available about Experience Design. Someones are not about Experience Design itself but they're about this notion of creating ""user experience"".Start by seeing Nathan Shedroff's website (The father of Experience Design - www.nathan.com) and then explore the creation of meaning with books like ""Semiotics: the basics"", Daniel Chandler. Semiotic is the base to create a significant user experience...(sorry about my ""not so good"" english ;)"
1,Wasn't helpful with a large web matrixed project,"I found this approach confusing, especially the separation of structural and skeleton planes. I relied heavily onInformation Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web SitesandDon't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition."
2,Elementary elements,"This book might be good for a beginner, but for anyone who does web design professionally, this book is much too basic. It's also extremely thin...not much text on the pages, and has been laid out in a way to make the page count much higher than it should be."
1,Superficial babble,"Not worth the paper it is printed on. A superficial treatment of analysis, design and implementation of web sites. After reading 73 pages of content-free material I finally gave up trying to find anything amid the fluff and chucked this one in the trash."
4,Great starter for novice,"Not to diminish the value of this great book, but, it is very basic. Establishes a good basic overall process to efficiently manage user interface development. Takes you through step by step. Essential to have this approach before looking at other aspects in more depth. Not technical, so you don't need to be a developer to understand concepts. Good value and a quick read."
3,An Introduction to User Interface Design,"The book is an introduction text to the field of user interface design.What I found useful in the book is thinking about the user interface as a number of layers and this reminds me of the layer approach used when explaining communication technologies. I've been using a simpler 3 layer model to communicate what is a user interface to non-professionals and that works.However, even knowing that a user interface contains several layers does not help you build a user interface. From my experience, building user interfaces requires synthesis. This is where I found this book lacking, it tells you about the required parts but unfortunately doesn't really help tell you how to put them together. Using a cooking analogy, you have the ingredients for the meal but you are missing the quantities and cooking times.Therefore this book is great to understand what a user interface but it is of limited help to build a user interface."
3,Rebuttal of Errors In Book Concerning General S.B. Buckner,"80% of this book is an excellent account of the Battle of Fort Donelson and objectively done. I have been studying this battle in detail for 9 years. The author deviates from objective writing in the 20% which reflects flagrant fact errors and a bias against the conduct of General S.B. Buckner. Without enumerating the scores of flawed reporting about General Buckner let it suffice to say if his performance was as poor as Mr. Gott portrays, Buckner would have been permanently relieved of command not only as a general, but as any officer. Intead President Jefferson Davis, his Secretary of War, and Adjutant General Sam Cooper promoted him to higher command immediately from release from prison. In addition General Longstreet wanted him for a division commander in his corps and Robert E. Lee requested President Davis to have him serve in his army. This in itself is a testament to Buckner's superior performance at Fort Donelson"
5,It Is Where The South Lost The War,"If you want a comprehensive, informative and easy to read account of Fort Donelson, Fort Henry and the tactical genius and errors of both sides, this is the book to read. The author does a fantastic job of providing accurate details of how the south did, in fact, lose the war by losing Kentucky and Tennessee. The war probably could have been over in 1862 had Lieutenant Phelps destroyed the bridge at Florence. Not doing so provided a retreat for A. S. Johnston to move his men to Corinth and then to Shiloh and allowed the railroad in the western confederacy to remain in tact. This is a GREAT book."
4,pretty good,This book offers a good analysis of an often overlooked campaign. My only criticisms are the somewhat poor maps and some (in places) poor editing.
4,The Constitutions,Another Heubsch winner. He explains what the Constitutions of the Roman Catholic Second Vatican Council means for people today.
4,i can make so much,"I am happy to have ""flour"" to make my bread and rolls and such. taste its not the most amazing but add a little salt or ur own spice in the ingredient of which you are making and it will be really good."
5,Trying to avoid wheat and gluten...,"I have used the Gluten Free Bisquick and loved it but thought I would try the flour and some of my own recipes...It is good for fried chicken--I dip the chicken in buttermilk and then the seasoned flour and it tastes like my grandmother's fried chicken...Still trying it out in different cake, cookie recipes but so far, it works great!!"
4,Great alternative to making it all from scratch.,Recently found this product after finding out I was gluten-intolerant. This is a great way to start if you do like to bake but do not want to take on buying all the ingredients needed to bake gluten-free. The box does not last long but so far this has worked well in all the usual recipes I cooked with when I was using regular flour.
4,dinner rolls,"I haven't tried this as a bread yet, just as dinner rolls. The first time I made them they turned out great.... The second time I made them they cracked on top and I don't understand why. Has anyone had this happen??????// Will purchase again and keep trying to get it right."
2,"This blend is all starch, not all-purpose","Recipes that work with other flour blends failed miserably with this flour blend. Sugar cookies melted and flattened in the oven and turned into hard-as-rock toffee well before the baking time was up. Zucchini bread didn't rise and ended up as a misshapen lump. Biscuits, like the sugar cookies, spread and flattened well before the baking time was up.I've tried and loved other flour blends. This one is only useful as a starch. I would not use it as an all-purpose flour."
5,best over all product,"Having recently been diagnosed with Celiac and a hobby baker, this item has been godsend! Though the rice flour in the product provides for a more grainy textured cooked product, I have found I can easily adapt to the change and my friends and family rarely notice that I have made the subtitution until they see me eating the same bake good that they are !"
3,First loaf of bread didn't come out so well,"My first try using this flour was to bake a loaf of bread. It didn't raise much, and came out very very dense. For now, I'll assume that the problem was in the baker, not in the flour. We'll see ..."
2,not quite the same,"It is flour and it is supposed to be 'the same' as normal but we could not get not even one recipe to work properly, so we gave up.. no cake in our house :("
3,"good taste, but poor texture for pie crust or crepes","This flour tastes great, but doesn't seem to have the best result when used by itself. I had high hopes after reading the reviews and my first attempt - pie crust - was a flop...the dough wouldn't stay together to even think about rolling it out...so I patted it into the pan and it tasted good - just crumbled. I then tried it in crepes and added xanthum gum and it seemed better, but still not great. My best success with it has been using 1/2 this and 1/2 Bob's red mill GF baking flour, along with some xanthum gum. The results are terrific - great taste and texture!!"
5,They do the job,"They work just like all other high quality Safariland merchandise. You can't get too ""tech"" with belt keepers. I purchased the high gloss which matched my utility belt perfectly."
4,Well done!,"Mr. Quinn has written an excellent insight into the psychology of predators and bullies. I highly recommend both this book and his previous work, ""Real Fighting"". His discussion of the ""interview"" used by potential adversaries is worth the price of either book alone. Psychology is 90% of the battle, and Quinn does a good job here."
5,great guide for overcoming fear from street to boardroom,"Peyton Quinn applies his lifetime of studying bullies up close and personal to offer this incisive and entertaining guide to how the good guys can deal with them. Street thugs and office bullies both use the ""woof"" - maybe an insult, maybe just a seemingly innocent comment or question, to ""interview"" a potential victim. This book teaches how to recognize the tactics, and offers practical counter tactics. Highly recommended! I have 25 years expereince as trial lawyer, and I wish I'd had this book when I started!"
3,"Would like to rate this one higher, but can't","This book was okay, but not outstanding or even what I'd call very good. Just okay. The 2 main characters, especially the hero, were both pretty naive and he especially made me want to throttle him time & time again.This book, though, sets the stage for the other ""Kiss Me"" sequels, that sadly, will probably never be written (one for Drury, one for Buggy, & one for Charles). I would especially like to read Drury'sstory, if ever it does get wrote, because of the 5 friends, he was my favorite. Buggy is cute, and Charles we don't know much about, but I wouldn't mind reading their books, either."
5,Kiss Me Again,"Great Story!I enjoyed it, read twice. Two people in love with each other from childhood: Fanny has always loved Brixton. Brixton has fought the feeling, running away from it. A waged was made in the previous book 'Kiss Me Quick' with his friends about him not marrying until he was fifty and certainly not Fanny. Fanny hears him and his friends discussing the wager and is upset, walks in, gives him a piece of her mind, issues another wager, and kisses him. After some back and forth bantering between them both, kissing, and a duel between her brother and Brixton where her brother cheats and accidentlly gets grazed. Brixton still running from his feelings for Fanny goes home but at the end he decides to tell her how he feels and she decides to go to him and tell him she still loves. They meet in an inn and finally declare they love each other and get married at the end. Quite romantic."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BOOK","This is one of the worst romance novels I have ever read. There was no romance. OMG! The characters were corny, the plot was stupid. Just a whole lot of back and forth mess about a wager. To top it off it was completely boring. The only sex scene in the entire book was at the end on the last 3 pages. I can't believe I read this crap!!!!!!!!"
3,"A sweet, light hearted european romance","Overall a light romance story with a silly plot, quirkly characters and a too-good-to-believe ending. There is some cheesy moments where the dialog gets so flowery I had a hard time staying with the book, but overall it kept me entertained. It isn't the type of book I normally like, and for that reason I probably wont read this author again. (I like my romance books hot and steamy, but this story was barely warm.)"
5,monster cable for bass purchased at amazon,The bass Monster cable does away with hum that regular cables have. A very good buy much better than other cables that I have. When I buy another cable it will be this one.
5,Found the Sound!,Wow...these speakers revealed the sound that had been missing for years! Replacing the factory speakers with these Infinitys was a no brainer...and at a great price!
4,Byron: Life and Legend,"This is a wonderfully detailed book on Lord Byron's life, written in a style that keeps one's interest. My onlyobjection is that the author takes greatliberty in discussingByron's sexuality in his later years. MacCarthy even offersup, without evidence, the suggestion that Bryon could have been a child molester. The characterizations as ""fact"" based on what the author believes was going on in Byron's head, are unfair, cruel and pretty outrageous."
1,Lurid tale of a wild imagination (the author's not B's),"This book is dogmatic and tiresome and silly, which things Byron was not. It fully justifies Byron's bad opinion of scholars and trusts all the calumnies the poet has ever abhored. Skip this biography that does the Murray publishing house as much good as their ""Death of God""Read the poetry and the letters. Read Malcolm Elwin and Drinkwater."
1,DISAPOINTEMENT IN A BOX,VERY DISAPPOINTING.Apparently Bill G. has billions to prevent linux from working with XP.Just another cruel experience to steel your time and cause frustration.
3,good info to prolong your happiness if you take action,"solid all around book with helping one make their life more healthy, rich and enjoyable.kind of an all in one answer, so much so that i stopped reading the magazine cuz it was all there.recommended"
4,Drowning in murky E-Buisiness waters.....,"After reading E-business To Go, I feel saved! Saved from the pool of consultant ya-hoos who are pulling me down with their heavy tech language and internet hype. Unlike others before him, Thompson, with a down-home approach to making e-business principles easy understand, gives clear ideas and concise examples that can be easily implemented in every day business. The message that anyone can be successful in the connected world is reiterated with enthusiasm and a genuine love of the subject. It doesn't have to cost a bundle to implement either, and I plan to get started right away!"
3,genev,"This particular Kindle e-book is a devotional, but a word of Caution: This work approaches sanctification from a Keswick Theology perspective. Worth reading, but keep in mind that Scripture alone is our only rule for faith and practice."
4,A MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO BE BETTER,I purchased the book based on reviews and I must agree that this is one of the most important books I have read. It is right up there with The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy. Both of these are so important if you are at a place where you want to be better and know how to get there. We all know basic common sense but this gives you incentive and guidance on how to move in that direction. I have bought several copies of the Absolute Surrender both on CD as well as paperback to give to family members. I highly reccomend this book!J.L.
5,Looking deep within,It seemed that every page brought me to look deep within myself to see what is really there. Am I totally surrendered in this area. Prayer will reveal how I can be totally surrendered. I can re-read this book over and over again. I have already recommended it to several people and that was after the 1st chapter.
5,Absolute Surrender,Word cannot begin to say how insightful this author is. And still speaking to us many years after his death.
5,Absolute Surrender,Absolute Surrender is an excellent book by Andrew Murray.Very good learning too I am told. I have not been able to read it yet. I make a lot of notes and underlines in my books. I never just read them. I do things to further my growth in the Lord Jesus. . Barb. B.
5,Thought provoking,"nobody speaks to the heart, like Andrew Murray, I've been reading his works over and over for 35 years, if you want to gain insight and understanding, buy his work"
4,Pretty good book,I am still reading this but so far it is great to learn and get understanding from it comes with the information needed to learn and understand I would tell everyone this is a good book to buy.
5,Life-changing!,"This book is fantastic! I have shared its message with many friends and have recommended it far and wide. This book goes deep, to the issues of the heart. While never cheapening salvation, it shows how God's grace is truly His power, and that it is needed not only at the beginning of the Christian life, but every step of the walk. Expect to be blessed!"
5,Lo mejor,"Probablemente este sea el mejor trabajo de Joaquín Sabina. Es un recorrido por ritmos y temas muy variados. Por el bulevar de los sueños rotos y siete crisantemos son dos de las canciones más emblemáticas de su carrera. Del resto, la mayoría son también clásicos: esta noche contigo, ruido, como un explorador. Ninguna canción sobra ni está fuera de lugar. Este disco debe estar en toda colección de música en español. Magnífico."
2,I hoped they they were better.,"I bought the gloves for a 1000 mile trip anticipating rain. I normally use my leather gloves with wax coating on them (old School), works great looks bad. I wanted to try something better but was disappointed. Ten minutes into the rain, 60 mph, medium rain and they started to leak at the pinky fingers. Forty five minutes into the rain and everything is dry but my hands. When I removed the gloves, the liner stuck to my hands pulling the liner inside out from the glove shell. That made it impossible to to use the gloves until they were dry and I could stuff the liner back in. I did get a good price for the gloves but they are not good in the wet, I will have them as a backup for my old school gloves."
5,1st to die (women's murder club) james patterson,This is the first book of the women's murder club mysteries by James Patterson. It was excellent. It keeps you in suspense right to the end. I couldn't put in down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries.
2,Not for Human Viewing,"This is quite possibly the worst wood working video on the planet earth. If you want to make a particular hand mirror, than find a friend who accidentaly bought it and watch the last half for free. If you want to see glimpses of overally complicated jigs for simple tasks shown to you by a guy with the personality of a tree stump, watch the first half of this video.You may be able to pick up some ideas about jigs, and see some very old techniques in raw form but this is one of the worst fine woodworking video I have ever seen."
3,Dish Soap Holder for the bathroom,I gave this an okay for the reason the top does not stay on solid. Something you cannot discern when you see this on-line. It doesn;t pop off but still it's not sturdy sometimes and if I had known that may have had second thoughts when buying it. The product does have a ring that it sits in and is just like the review. okay.
3,A Quick Overview,"""The Life and The Times of Al Capone"" was a very interesting autobiography. Though I am not a big fan of reading, I really enjoyed this book. It doesn't go into great detail about his life because of the fact of it only being 45 pages, but the facts that it does contain are interesting and are about main points throughout his life. Stockdale tells how things were back then and how hard and scary life had to be. The book would have been a lot better if it would have been longer and went into greater detail. If you are the type of person interested in the Prohibition years in American history, this is one book that tells the story about the times. I would recommend this book and I would give it a three star rating out of five, only because I wanted more information."
5,You will remember this book,"What happened in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge is beyond words, but this book manages to convey the emotions and horror of it all. It is a penetrating and riveting story of survival against the odds, in a context and a culture which are well outlined. How the Cambodian society evolved the way it did, what was life like in the country side, what the regime did to people are impressively laid out.Whether you are interested in Southeast Asia's history or how people deal with extreme suffering, or want to pay tribute to the victims, this is a must read."
3,Lousy copy,"The story of Haing Ngor is terrrific, but this copy of the book looks like it was pirated from another edition. There were sections that differed from copies friends had and part of the text was unreadable. Not a great copy."
4,Gripping,A well written and gripping account of a man's life. Informative and heartbreaking. A must read book about Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge.
5,incredible,"After having seen the movie ""The Killing Fields"" I wanted to learn more about Haing Ngor's story. It is incredible to believe that anyone could survive the horrors Cambodia endured during the late 1970's. This is a stirring story of one man's incredible will to survive under unbelievable hardship."
1,bon't buy this product,"I have had one for 18 months, and then the power module and panel went out, they wanted $2700 to fix! more than original cost of unit and $1000 more than what you can purchase a new one for."
3,Toshiba's good try,"We have now owned this TV for a year and two months. During that time it has been OK with a couple of quirky things, like low buzzing sounds when it is switched off. The cabinet is very contemporary, the sound is very good considering the speaker grill is an inch wide and three inches deep. It has ample inputs and outputs. In all a nice set...until exactly two months out of warranty the picture went haywire. UPDATE - After nearly three months, Toshiba issued a full manufacturers' credit towards another TV. The repair shop said we were extremely luck, if it were most any other brand, it would be too bad for us. Our present TV is a Sharp Aquos LCD, and the sound and picture are not quit as good, even though the Toshiba was a much lower resolution. (The newest Toshiba LCD's were not avaialable at the time). Kudos to Toshiba for doing the right thing. You have truly earned our loyalty to your brand!"
1,Weary of Incredible Promises,"I purchased this product because of its odor-free-promise. True, Blue-Emu does not emit the characteristic menthol scent of the other pain relief creams, but it also does not produce the much needed pain relief. If you are considering buying a pain relief cream and are able to stand the smell of menthol, then I would suggest going with a traditional cream. The results produced by Blue-Emu are, considering the other reviews for this product, too hit-and-miss to warrant spending that much money."
2,Doubtful,I really don't think this does anything to help pain. It does not smell though so that's truthful. Don't waste your money.
5,Blu Emu big surprise,I was so surprised at how well this product works. I have bone spurs so numerous my doctor can't count them in my feet. I have pain on and off but it is severe at times. Within minutes Blu Emu will relieve med-slight pain totally. Severe pain is reduced to tolerably.Which I am highly grateful for. I have arthritis in my hips. I now use this product nightly with great results. I see some people don't get good results. I would recommend giving it a try considering it's over the counter and non-narcotic.
1,Worthless stuff,"I bought this to treat arthritis, back pain, and general aches and pain. I found it expensive and totally ineffective. I noticed no pain relief whatsoever. Save your money or try something else."
4,Blue Emu for You,"This is not exactly a miracle, but it comes close. I was sceptical at first but was I ever surprised. After applying this on my lower back (arthritis)within 5 minutes the pain had almost stopped. I try to keep this on hand for that purpose. Try it and you will agree that Blue Emu is for You."
5,childrens yaga,I was watching my grandson of five years doing the routine with the children on the disc when his two year old sister joined in on the action. Nothing in this is too hard and the children can do it alone with the children on the disc. Great deal
5,Good introductory dvd,"I have never had any experience with kids yoga before, so this was a great introductory dvd. Hearing the language of how she interacted with kids was very helpful."
1,Blaaaaaaaaaargh!,"As a Brazilian woman, I totally fail to understand the appeal Paulo Coelho has throughtout the world. I am so sad that he is the best selling author that Brazil has exported. Keep in your mind: he is not the best author Brazil has! To evaluate Brazilian literature, please read Jorge Amado and then you'll be able to evaluate the riches of our literature!"
1,One Star is Too Much,"I really wish Amazon had a zero-star rating so I could truly rate this book. Paulo Coelho once said of his critics that they were jealous he sold millions of copies. Well, most authors should be jealous of anyone who sells so many books. It is too bad that the best-selling books are usually garbage. Real literature never sells this easy."
1,New age psuedo-wisdom - not for me,"I fail to understand the appeal of Paulo Coelho if By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept is typical of his work. The book purports to be a love story between a seminarian and an old friend - a college student - in the context of doubt, search for truth, following one's true calling etc. etc. etc.The issues raised and their resolutions are trite and presented in a manner that gives one no confidence in the author. Is he writing for money or fame? out of a misconception of his own wisdom?I suspect that when I first was out of college and reading psuedo-Tibetan drivel, I would have enjoyed this book; so I do understand that there is a place for this book. That place is not on my bookshelf."
1,Retitle this book: In Praise of Ignorance,"A reader living in the first century B.C.E. might be excused for five-starring this novel, which ignores seminal knowledge humans have gained in the past two thousand years. It's selling the most absurd Ol' Time religious brew, laced with concepts like destiny and magical cures that are an insult to anyone at all familiar with 20th century physics, to anyone with a clue to a contemporary vision of this creation of billions of galaxies and multiverses in which we are embedded. I can weep -- either sitting or standing -- contemplating all the willfully ignorant people who consider this inspirational. It's the worst novel I've read in half a century, but then, it's the only Coelho novel I've ever read."
3,It's no Alchemist...,"If you are new to Paulo Coelho, buy the Alchemist. This book has it's own charm, but does not have the greatness of the Alchemist. The love story and religious plot line are interesting, although more often than not, it is confusing."
2,Not his best work,"I really enjoyed ""The Alchemist"" and ""Veronica Decides to Die."" This book, however, struck me as overtly preachy, slow, overly philosophical and melodramatic.I didn't particularly like the characters.Changes happened too abruptly, and kept reversing, like a soap opera.Try his other books first."
3,Maybe I'm Just Shallow...,"If Bridges of Madison County had been written by Richard Bach... This novel is a test for any true cynic (or skeptic - which am I? can't tell...). With unabashed straightforwardness, Coelho examines religion and love and comes up on the side of . . . both, I think. Look, if had read this in my 20's, I might've been swept up, but I wasn't completely repelled either. It does, however, require setting aside all cynical thoughts, and I'm just not completely able to do that. So maybe it's more my fault than his... Maybe."
1,Not Good at All!!!!,"Paulo Coelho books beside being cheap reading and not a great literary work they sound the same and feel the same. If you are beach reader, lazy reader and don't care about the quatlity this is a book for you. I disliked it!!!!!!"
4,"Pure, simple writing causes shivering impact and insight","This is the first book I've read that I immediately went back to the beginning and read again. I strongly advise this for everyone. The message is pure, writing is simple, almost childlike, but the impact on me was breathtaking.It will take on different meaning and significance each time I read it, and I expect it to be part of the map of my life"
4,Pondering Paulo,"I was onboard a flight to Verona when I read this journey. Why do I use the word 'Journey'? Paulo Coelho's works each has a journey and a message to share. I do not agree or want to agree with every message, yet the subtleties and the intricate story telling kept my interest and forced me to read on. 'By the River Piedra', is a tale of the power of love and Paulo's explanation of true love. Is love solely discovered with the person you are with, or the person you are?The novel is both spiritual and thought provoking."
2,After reading Piedra I lay down and slept,"After hearing so many good things about The Alchemist and other Coelho works, I was eager to pick up a copy of Piedra at a local used book store.... then I started reading it, and I got over the whole 'eager' thing. I found this book profoundly underwhelming, profoundly un-profound. Maybe something got lost in the translation; far from seeming 'resonant', the spare, sparse, bare-bones narration and dialogue just felt dull and ineffectual. So the writing style wasn't all that innovative or noteworthy; the characters were sketchy, and as a result, the plot's dramatic climax had no emotional impact. Again, the flat writing style made the book's outcome appear arbitrary - he leaves, he stays, who cares? The two characters probably should have skipped the religious lecture circuit and signed up at A.A. in the first place."
5,(Silvia Guzman)Montebello Adult School,"Dear readers, I read the book ""By The River Piedra I sat down and wept. I think it is a wounderful story of love the two protagonist, Pilar and her love show their feeling and fight to recover their great love that started from their childhood. I recommend this book because is a special story of love."
4,A Spiritual Love Story,"This is a book written for all romantics at heart. Paulo Coelho has written another superb novel based on the power of love, faith and hope. This book is inspirational, and pushes us to believe and learn to recognise the little miracles that appear to us each day. Dreams do take hard work, patience and a lot of tears, but the author teaches us never to loose hope. Paulo manages to move and inspire through this story. Excellent! It made me trust in love again!"
4,If you like the alchemist - you'll love this,"Paulo Coelho continues his philosophy of following your dreams, BUT this time he confronts the controversial issues of religion, mysticism & love.This time he uses two young people (male & female), childhood lovers. One has traveled the world & the other has chosen to stay in the small town they grew up in. Not till years later did they cross paths once again and together they explore the issues of duty, social norms and real love.Like all of Paulo Coelho's novels he transmits strong life messages into magical stories that fill you with light.I found more meaning in the story due to my personal knowlege of the Catholic religion. This was a definate advantage.I felt that this didn't dig as deep as the Alchemist did BUT, at the same time, he confronted the issues mentioned above with great success. As well as this, it's a very beautiful love story."
3,"Not bad, but disappointing","I admired so much ""the Alchemist"" of the author, so I didn't hesitate a second to read this one. I won't say terrible things like some viewers from below did, but truly it wasn't impressive as the first one. It's just a pretty love story and makes us think about the religion for a while. Good if you're seeking a book which can calm you down. After all, not bad but surely not the best."
2,Read The Valkyries instead,"I felt like something was missing, that this was discription of some experience important to the author, that he had a memory in his mind but forgot that we as readers don't have the background. We never know how these two lovers met, why they fell in love, how they grew apart, or what was so difficult about reuniting. Often the most profound feelings of love and spirituality the characters experience is under the influence of a lot of wine. We don't even really find out how it all ends or why a spiritual life and a simple life in the place of ones birth are mutually exclusive.After reading the Valkyries, I felt like the holes were filled in."
3,"Not for me, but read on . . .","I found the book very much on the ""preachy"" side. I like the idea of using story to share one's spiritual beliefs with the world; but for it to work well, the concepts need to be subtle.On the other hand, Christians, particularly Catholics, who like to see concepts of their faith put to story, this could be very rewarding.Despite my misgivings, I do see a beauty in the author's story-telling style. I would like to someday read other works of his."
5,awesome,one of my favorite coelho books. not like you can go wrong with coelho. highly recommend. love him and his books.
2,*NOT* the Alchemist,"I read The Alchemist by Pablo Coehlo a few years ago and remember it as memorable and a good read. With this in mind I picked up his more current book, By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. The story moved along swiftly at the beginning but then the philosophical issues presented kept repeating themselves and the language continued to be so ""flowery"", that I lost interest in the characters. Maybe because I am not religious and am not overtly spiritual but even for those of you who are, I think the characters become tedious. I feel like the book repeated itself and nothing new was introduced in the second half, nothing dynamic happened and the climax of the story came and went without much notice. I could see potential but I felt like I was just let down. If you are spiritual, you might enjoy this but when I read the last page I felt like Coehlo had gotten lazy on this novel."
3,Spiritual Love Dilemma,The conflict the seminarian battles through was a legitimate one in the sense that sometimes a difference in or lack of religious ideas prevents others from loving us. That's ironic because that's what religion is all about: love not only for God and for each other. When the seminarian realizes this he also realizes he doesn't have to choose between his love for Pilar and his devotion to God.
1,Disgusting,"Compared to other books by Coelho it is a piece of trash. It lacks the spirituality that stems from ""The Alchemist"" or ""Veronika decides to die"". It is instead a cheap religious book with some twists on Christianity that may be extremely offensive to both atheists and religious fanatics. The story line is weak and the characters are hardly developed. The love story of the two characters -if it can be defined as such- is pure background to Coelho's true intention os spreading the gospel. Best advice yet: don't buy it, save yourself money and hours of boredom."
4,Good Food for Thought,"I read this book after reading Coelho's, The Alchemist. It is not as rich a story as The Alchemist but still worth reading. Coelho excels at writing his novels from a philosophical perspective. The two main characters have major life decisions to make and he does a fabulous job of taking the reader through the character's philosophical reasoning as to why they make the decisions they make. I truly enjoyed this book and plan to read more of Coelho's work."
5,great read,"I read this book a while ago after reading another of Paulo Coelho's book, The Alchemist. I recently bought this book for a friend because I remember just how great this book was and how easily we could relate to the character's struggle. From what I can recall, this book continues on with the character trying to find his destiny and along the way, having to decide what can truly make him happy and yet knowing that there will be sacrifice involved."
1,A sister book to Bridges of Madison County?,"If you loved The Bridges of Madison County, By the River Piedra is for you. It is a smarmy, self-congratulatory love story couched in new age mysticism meant to make the tale sound serious. By the River stupifies the reader with the same thoughts, the same phrases, slightly reworded and then repeated endlessly. The characters are stick figures. The ""childhood friend"" character, now a man belonging to a religious order, mouths the spiritual platitudes of the author. Pilar, the female protagonist, was surely written to draw in the romance novel crowd. If you want to read some excellent Central or South American writing, pick up Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende. Coelho is best left on the shelf"
2,Deep as that dirt-filled well over there,"This book was most unfortunate. The author just wanted to shove spirituality and religion down my throat. I liked the last 25 pages or so very much, but the entire first portion of the book was painful to read. The protagonist/narrator was boring and I mostly just wanted to smack her rather than identify with her problems and the like. The book tried to be really deep, yet it was very forced and unsuccessful, I think. Maybe I'm just too jaded and/or cynical for this genre of book."
2,Small Font Is Unreadable in the Harper Perennial 2006 Ed,The font in the Harper Perennial 2006 P.S. Edition is sized at about 1. It is nearly unreadable without a magnifying glass. Find another edition of this book if you have anything less than 20/20 vision. The story is lovely and redeeming but you won't be able to find out from this edition.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"Interesting at times but overall not as good as I had hoped. Could have developed the themes and the female's character return to religion with much more depth and explained better what she ""lost"" her faith to begin with. A so-so read but overall under developed characters and reasons for what they do and why."
4,wow,"if you have read anything by dan brown and you enjoyed his descriptive accounts of the femine face of God this story is without a doubt for you. i am a 20 year old male, pretty moderate, and this book sparked my faith and ideas from all over. read with care and take not of all the pensive ideas it is full of. enjoy."
5,Solid Book,I love that this book allows me to learn more about a different culture of which I previously had no experience with.
5,A personal favorite,"One of the many versions in my first readings of the Bhagavad Gita after learning of this mesmerizing teaching for the first time in 1971 from my older brother, and it continues to be valued and fondly appreciated through the years since."
3,Some terms should not be translated,"I own a dozen translations of the Bhagavad-gita besides this one. It reads rather easily. It is distinctive in that it is a verse translation rather than prose. On that score it is far more readable than Edwin Arnold's.My main complaint has to do with Miller's decision to render a number of key Indian concepts into less than satisfactory English terms. For example, she translates 'Sankhya' as 'philosophy'. This is misleading because Sankhya is a specific philosophical system; its not philosophy a simpliciter. But still worse is her decision to render 'yoga' as 'discipline'. 'Discipline' carries many connotations, but none of them is naturally suggestive of yoga. The translation came out originally in 1986. By that time, yoga was reasonably familiar to English speakers. The message of the song/poem would have come across better if certain terms like 'yoga' had been left untranslated."
2,Nonsensical,"I would rate this valuable only to those who really enjoy reading nonsense. I was directed to this writing by someone who compared this to Holy Scripture (i.e. The Word of God, or the Bible) so I wanted to see if there was any comparison. I am glad I read it but honestly it just cannot be mentioned in the same sentence as really any of the really good translations of the Word of God (KJV, NIV, ESV, NASB)."
1,A bland translation,"Having read many editions of the Gita,this would be the poorest, and even though this one was designed to be an easy read it has been made rather shallow by too many meaningless word replacements not true to the original.In an effort to look original(there are now almost 200 different English translations of the B Gita), the author has chosen a style and pale words that drain the life out of this beautiful spiritual document.I do not recommend this edition, you will not get the real feeling of what this work is about."
3,Bhagavad-Gita,"I picked this up because it is one of the essential texts of Hindu culture and I enjoy learning the history of culture and religions. This particular text is a series of conversations between the Arjuna (a warrior/prince) and the god Krishna. There are some interesting sections on what is the basis of action is and how we should approach it mentally and overcome our physical desires.I don't like to rate books that can be viewed as religious texts, so I give them all 3 stars as a rule.3/5"
1,Pointless translation,"I got my hands on this 'pocket-'book by chance about 14 years ago and what a disappointment it was then! There is no Sanskrit, yoga is translated as !discipline!.. Did Ms. Miller have a clue about what she was doing other than make some money? Now that I have read translations by Sri Yogananda and Prabhupada, I have the ability to comment on it further.The Bhagavad Gita is not a simple set of words to be translated, this is a philosophy of life in sutra form-absolutely condensed so it could be passed down by guru to disciple by word of mouth. The guru transfers the knowledge not only by recitation but by showing actual practise.So, Ms. Miller has no qualification to translate other than knowledge of a language which can be picked up by a 10 year old. Even a 10 year old would do a better job at translating 'yoga'."
1,Bagavath Gita in English -- are you kidding,"People, fist of all Bagavad Gita is 5136 years old and not some first century AD poem. Also, if one is really interested you have to go through either in Sanskrit or Kannada. Next, its not something you can pick of the shelf and learn. Each word has deep meaning and require in depth philosophical knowledge. I'm not trying to deter. But an Western writer on Gita is a disgrace and joke. To put in simple terms, no historical and philosophical work from Bharatha (India) can be translated into English. You have to learn the language (either Sanskrit or Kannada) and requires studying under good guidance from a well known Vaishnava teacher."
3,It is all in the name!,"This book only focuses on organizing and promoting seminars. It does not give much information about how to actually conduct a seminar. If you or someone you know is skilled in conducting seminars, then this book will help turn that skill into profit. But if you want to know how to conduct a seminar, buy a different book."
4,"Good product, but backing is hard to remove","This tape appears to be the best available, but the blue backing is hard to remove and takes too much time. The manufacturer needs to address this with a diagram or redesign."
4,An undiscovered Jem,"Stephen Walker has developed a unique and very odd stlye of writing that forces you to accept what is on the page, like it or not and most of the time you do like it, a lot. His surreal approach to humour leaves you totally unawares as to what may happen in the next sentence let alone page. The most amazing thing about it is that all the many non-sequential and seemingly random remarks in it aren't random at all but come together in that trap fatal to any reader. However this book dosen't quite reach the heights of his first book to which I give 5 stars."
2,"Good, but not worth the price","I bought this as a gift for my mother. She almost never uses it, as it is more complex than her crock pot, and doesn't do much more than crock pot functions for her. We used it to make a spaghetti sauce one day and set it on low. By the time we returned from a trip to a nearby town (3 houres) the sauce was overcooked and scorched in spots. That was a dissapointment. The pot was set as low as we could set it. If you cna watch this while cooking, it gets hotter than a regular crock pot, but if you only intend it for crock pot cooking, save your money."
4,Great Clay Rice Cooker,"This is a very good clay rice cooker. I cooked rice with regular non-stick rice cookers, steel pot, high pressure cooker, the clay rice cooker does made the best rice. Of course it needs to be handled with extreme care because it is very easy to break. The only small minus point is when the lid is open, the water from the steam will drop back to the pot because there is no small cup like other rice cookers have to catch the water."
5,Vita Clay 8- Cup Rice and Slow Cooker,"I recently purchased this product after doing research about slow cookers. I was attracted to this vita-clay product because I liked the fact that the pot is made of clay and not metal(aluminum-steel). I have only used it once to cook rice. The rice came out great and the clay pot was easy to clean after usage. I look forward to having delicious soups, beans and rice this winter."
2,"Great Cooker, Horrible Keeper","We purchased this product to avoid the teflon and aluminum rice cookers. It makes great rice the first night. But by morning the rice is cooked onto the bottom of the pot and the rest that is not stuck is watery. Clean up is a nightmare. The clay pot cannot handle temperature change, so first it must be cooled, then the rice that is stuck must be soaked off. It will not pry off the pot with my plastic rice paddle. Cleaning and rice preparation thus takes about 30 minutes.At least when the teflon and aluminum pots hardened the rice they were easy to clean up."
1,"nice for a while, didn't last long.","This rice cooker worked well at first. I did have to soak it to clean out the rice, but that was fine. After a few months, though, it started giving me an error message when i tried to use it. Since it was still within the warranty period I packaged it all up and sent it back (expensive postage!) to the address I'd been given. That was at least a year ago, and I've never heard a word back. I would not buy this brand again."
2,Did not fit well in my old Sylvania panel,"After buying a few of these and reading some reviews about the aluminum buses in the panel used with these breakers, I decided to replace my electrical panel with a new Square D panel with copper bus and new breakers. I just donated the bunch to Habitat.They did not fit very well in my original panel. Loose fitting."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great","This is the first book of the series that I've read, so take what I write for what it is worth. Since it builds on the first a little bit, you're left wondering how a couple of the characters came together.It is a fast read, but sometimes the settings are not fleshed out enough."
2,Good. . .but WAIT for the paperback version,"This was a good book, and is necessary to complete the storyline so artfully begun in Book One of the series; HOWEVER, it felt like it was originally three chapters that were stretched out into a complete book (like it probably was). The book IS worth reading, but NOT at hardcover prices.If you haven't read the first one yet, then wait and buy them both as either individual paperbacks OR in their eventual ""single-bound"" version. THEN you can enjoy it.If you HAVE read the first one, then put it aside and have Amazon ""email alert"" you to the paperback's release. Or, try your local library. Once you get the second one, skim through the first book (you'll need to, even if you only walked away for a couple of weeks) to remind you of the storyline and where all the characters were last left standing."
4,A good follow-up book,This book picks up seconds after book one. By the end of the book I was left thinking that this was a perfect ending to the story. Here again we see Geordi dealing with his love interest Leah Brahams. She has been busy moving up the chain of command and now has a crew of her own. The crew of the Enterprise start succuming to the aliens that set off the Genesis Wave in order to save their dying civilization. Billions are dead and the Klingons are in the unconventional roll of acting as transport ships of the injured and refugees left in the wake of a massive evacuation that has decimated much of the alpha quadrant.Makes a nice tie-in to the Star Trek S.C.E. series.
5,102 Dalmations is adorable AND cool!,"I was searching for a new game for my 5 year old daughter who thinks there is nothing out there but Spyro. She fell in love with 102 Dalmations. It is very similar to Spyro because the puppy (Domino or Oddball - you get to choose)gets to explore each world.The object is to resue the captured puppies. Your doggy can jump, spin attack its enemies, sniff the ground, dig for treasures and bark (just because sometimes a puppy needs to bark!).We have really just begun the game, but are already having a blast saving the helpless little dalmations, collecting bones and fighting the bad guys.My daughter (and me too) would definately recommend this game to other kids in her age group (5 - 8)."
4,102 dalmations,"my three year old granddaughter loves this game. it's about the only one of the true 'juvenile' games that she comes back to play on a regular basis. although her uncle has helped her to finish it, it is nothing for her to start a new game, as she just loves certain scenarios. i'm not a fan of disney games, but this one is a winner. she loves it, it doesn't shelf sit and that's what counts!"
3,pretty good,"The graphics are pretty darn good, but the fun factor is....well isnt great. there are a few funny parts, but i cant tell u."
4,Decent product,"Good product, reasonable price and works with anything with a regular headphone jack. Works like it is suppose to. Only negative thing is that the plastic feels brittle and seems easy to damage if your not gentle and when you use it on internal batteries it dosen't last more than a day or so. Best if used in the car. Set it the way you need it and plug it in to a 2 or 3 way 12V power outlet adapter and leave it alone if you can, it has a power button so you don't have to leave it on.It has good range. There was very little bleed thru of radio stations. I plug it into the headphone jack of the portable DVD player and played the sound thru the car stereo. Great for sitting in a parking lot waiting or parked next to the brook hoping for the fishing line to move!"
4,MP3 in your car Cables To Go Port Authority 2,Bought to listen to MP3 library in my car. Easy to hook up and sounds fine. The only issue I had was that many of the 12 FM frequencies available were to close to station and bled over. Fortunate one isn't and works fine.
1,waste of money,"Product not good, there is a lot of static when playing ipod. It is sitting on shelve, as I said in title, waste of money ...do not purchase this product."
1,This thing sucks,This thing is crap doesn't even work in the car. All you get is a bunch of static interference. Works okay with the home stereo. Don't recommend buying it.
3,Needs improvement,"In my experience with the excellent Sandisk Clip MP3 player, the output level must be turned up very, very high in order to overcome the background noise and hiss. This means much higher battery drain of the MP3 player than for ordinary playback with earphones. The Authority 2 adapter ought to have a volume control or at least a 2-3 step gain adjustment so that a reasonable (e.g. normal earphone level) output signal)would work well.I wish devices like this were made by people who understand how to design products to be easy and convenient to use and who then put the devices through extensive user testing before releasing a product for sale."
5,mp3 accessories,This product works well with my Sony Walkman. Sometimes the sound can be fuzzy if turned up too loud and it is a little bulky when I put my seat all the way up because of the way it sticks out of the electrical socket. But I do love it!
5,my ipod just got better,The only negative I have to say about this product is that the directions are a little on the skimpy side but since I had another one previously I pretty much knew how to hook it up. But a first time user might not. But otherwise the sound quality is pretty good.
2,Variable static over most frequencies,I bought this product a few weeks ago. The main problem with the product is that there is static that interferes with the sound quality. I have tried most frequencies - and the thing is that on an empty frequency the signal is great as long as the engine is turned off. Once you start the car this leads to static. Given that some users have reported that they are satisfied with the product it might just be a function of the car you drive!
4,Avoid Static and It's Great,"It's simple. just as described, but I got a loud hiss when powered through the cig adapter. No so much with AAA batts, but they don't last very long. I listen to audio books which I download to my laptop. For kicks I bought a USB Male to Male cable to power the xmitter from the laptop. Works great, no hiss. Just discard the cig adapter portion, power it through the USB cable, connect the audio cable and you are in business!"
4,Very satisfied,Quality of sound is good. easy to connect to my phone or mp3 player. Got a call while listening to music on my phone and was able to hear the caller over car speakers.
1,Item Stopped Working,"I bought this item more than a year ago and now it turns itself off about every minute or so while I am listening to my MP3. I called the manufacturer, Cables To Go, and they said they discontinued making this product because of a ""faulty switch problem."" Even though they have known of this problem for ""1-2 years"" they would not refund my money because my unit didn't have the problem with the faulty switch until it was outside the 1-year warranty. Amazon also would not help and they continue to sell the rest of the potentially faulty units. Buyers beware!!"
3,decent,"This item was decent for its price. However, if you do not unplug it when not in sue it devours batteries and it is a bit limiting in the station selections it allows."
3,Meh,"As a product, it's not bad.Does what it says on the box. Sound quality is not great.The sound quality of mp3 player thru this device ranges from ""acceptable"" to ""atrocious"" depending on whether you can find a static free station.3/5-D"
1,Very bad,My first telescope was just like this one. A telescope that has a 60mm apature can not be pushed to 660x and still be useful. For a 60mm apature you'll want to stay under 125x. Power for a telescope is not important. I got a very clear view of Saturn with only 80x. I have a scope that has 8 inches of apature. Do yourself a faver and spend more money and buy a better scope.
2,For Pete's Sake,"Every family has a skeleton or two, but they generally don't move around. While planning the Fourth of July gala and her grandmother's funeral, Pete finds an extra body hidden in the decorations. Thus begins her game of let's hide grandfather's mistress' corpse so her murder won't sully granny's memory, complicated by the body vanishing. She wanted this, but she wanted to know where it was placed as well, and by whom. Her endeavors are assisted by divorce attorney Danny Benedict who is in town for secret reasons of his own. What is meant to be a madcap, possibly warmly humorous Southern comedy of errors is more error than comedy, relying on stereotypical eccentricity and confusion to create a result that is quite flat."
3,"Romance book, not a mystery","I gave this book 3 stars as I did like the characters very much, they were real and worth liking. I got this book off the mystery shelf, NOT the romance shelf, there was no mystery here, just far too much lust and little else. The lust in this book dominated the whole book, this is not what I was after, I wanted a MYSTERY! The writer/publisher needs to make sure these books end up on the ROMANCE shelf next time, they have no place in the mystery department."
4,Fun but you could get boared from it.,"I like this it's cute but if you use it too much you could get boared of it.I used it for 2 months in a row but I got boared of it. I still use it sometimes when I feel like it. It counts how many steps you take. You play this game where you try to guess if the card is higer or lower. The lowest it goes is to a 2. And if you guessed right you earn watts. You have too give watts too your Pikachu once a week. If you don't it will call you a Meanie. It's the 1st and only virtual pet that's color. And it doesn't beep like the Tamagotchi's did. That's all it does. And you cheek up on it to see what it's doing. And if you have Pokemon Silver or Gold you could trade watts from the Color Pikachu to your game pack to get mystery items. Like I said, it's fun but if you use it to much you could get boared of it."
3,Why won't he be my friend ???,This Pokemon Pikachu 2 GS is fun and I've had it for years now but I can never get Pikachu to be my friend. No matter how much watts I give him he still remains at calling me a MEANIE. I walk with it and was very active carrying it with me everywhere but I never accumlated enough watts. I tried to play the Higher or Lower game but I lose more than I win. Is there anyone who can zap me a huge amount of watts or at least give me a clue to win Pikachu over easily ? =/
5,great reading,What a wonderful book. Bo is very candid about her life and times. I loved every word and picture. Great mind not just another pretty face. What a great love story.
1,Don't even waste your time,"1 star only because it will burn well in my fireplace this winter.Yeah, like some others I sure wish I hadn't pre-ordered this waste of time and space. Forget learning anything. And the 2 CDs are full of stuff you probably already have or don't want anyway. Harlan and Shamms must be twins."
2,Only if you are a beginer,"Nothing in this book felt new. But I happen to know AE very well. If you are a begginer then you may really profit. It doesn't go to very advanced levels, and it lacks deep explanations that would allow the user to move fowards rather than imitate. Is more of a cookbook than a learning book."
2,Mostly for beginners...,"My star rating may be misleading - I am sure that beginners would find this book very useful, since it is very step by step. More experienced users of After Effects will probably be frustrated by the fairly basic tutorials. The cd includes some nice goodies such as royalty-free movies and audio."
2,Where are the FREE video clips??? (Dishonest Offer),"I was very upset to find that the FREE royalty free clips that came with the book were nowhere to be found. Oddly, there is a readme which suggests the clips SHOULD be on the CD.The tutorials are for beginners only. Overall a waste of money and a long time searching for something not included as promised on the book cover."
1,I feel a bit ripped of - sorry,"Man, I can't believe I bought this book. It is only for total beginners but it doesn't say that on the editorial. Not only does it lack anything but simple everyday techniques but it also uses tacky project examples (not that I insulted my self by trying any).Just goes to show, you should always read the Amazon reviews."
2,Not a good choice,"If you have no idea what After Effects is, maybe this is a good choice. If you are impressed with terrible, fake-looking graphics (eg - you are in the third grade), then this book is a good choice. I made the wrong choice.Things that are nice about the book: it holds your hand and walks you screen to screen, mouse-click to mouse-click, through the tutorials. If you have NO IDEA what you are doing, this is great.However, the project examples are so terrible, you have no desire to go through the step-by-step process to get to the lame end-results. Who wants fake red drops of ""blood"" falling from Halloween text? It takes 15 pages to get to something I could blue screen together in 6 seconds in Premiere to impress my dog, my friend's infant, and maybe some ants.If you are looking to produce something marketable with After Effects, keep right on looking past this book. But, if you know nothing, nothing at all about After Effects and maybe even computers, this book is for you!"
3,"Works great, but....","Bought this when it first came out after seeing on HGTV. It worked great for about a week, then a piece broke off due to the water pressure. Called customer service. They were more than willing to replace the whole unit. Second one broke in same spot after one or two usages. I gave up and threw it out."
5,I was skeptical but WOW,"I was initially skeptical of this because I've used some ""roller washers"" in the past that just didn't do much and/or made a huge mess, took forever, etc...Despite its simplicity, this product actually works and works well! It takes awhile to fully clean each roller but the mess is nicely self contained within the cylinder and nothing else needs to be done to clean the roller afterward.The rollers do end up a little bit wet and so a roller spinner is recommended to help get more water out. But for cleaning the rollers it sure beats standing at the sink with the water running for a half hour.My one minor complaint is that you do need a nice flat surface to put the cylinder on otherwise it can tip over."
4,Just like the old days!,"It took a little getting used to the cord coming out of the bottom, but after you get used to it, it brings back memories! Very easy to use and control your game."
4,Wii Classic,This is great. Feels better when playing the Virtual Console games than when using the Wii remote. Go get one!
4,Just a few small annoyances...,"This controller was great for playing my Wii virtual console games, since I don't have a regular GameCube controller. There were a couple things I didn't like about it though. The first is that the cable comes out of the bottom of the controller. This is uncomfortable and weird. The second is that the controller is so light. I like my controllers to have a bit of weight to them, but other people might like it light.Something that boggled me for some time were the mysterious slots in the back of the controller. I did some research and I believe the only thing that makes use of the slots is theNyko Wii Classic Controller Grip."
3,Not really needed,So far you don't need this controller unless you purchase Sega Genesis or N64 games for the virtual console. I have only NES games and there is no need for this controller.
3,Rather Awkward,"In my opinion, the Wii classic controller is awkward to hold. I own an N64 and to go from that controller to the classic was weird. I dont reccomend it unless the wii gets games that require the controller, as others have said before me. The gamecube controller will work just as well and be more at home in your hands. Wait until its required for something to purchase it."
1,Fake - NOT made by Nintendo,"These controllers are third-party controllers with a Wii ""faceplate"" attached to them. On the backside of authentic Nintendo controllers there is a Nintendo stamp on the plastic, on these there is none. I was a bit skeptical when I received them as they have a bit of separation between the plastic halves and are off-colored. The buttons are also not as reliable as authentic controllers. This is pretty shameful to try and pass these off as made by Nintendo, which they are not! Beware, if you want to save money you get what you pay for, but I would recommend to buy authentic and save yourself the hassle of these ""Made by Nintendo"" Classic Controllers."
5,Works great!,This is pretty close to the original I remember playing with - about 15 years ago! There are extra buttons that kind of get in the way at times but it is a good functioning unit that can play all the classic games!
4,Using classic wii controller for downloadable games,"It's great that you can download older games from Nintendo onto your wii and use a classic controller to play them. I can enjoy 'Mario Kart 64' now, which in my opinion is the best one in the franchise."
3,Get the pro instead,It's great that Wii lets you play the classic games. But get theWii Classic Controller Pro - Blackinstead - it has more options and is the same price.
3,Get the Nyko instead.,"It works, but it is not very comfortable. You still have to plug it to the Wii controller, so you'll have that hanging and/or around you. Get the Nyko Wii Wing Wireless Controller instead, it is $10 more, but worth the money."
4,Excelent,"I actually bought a snes->wii adapter, but didn't remember the snes controller being so lame. After I got sick of that, I bought the classic controller in hopes of making VC games play a little better. It did, and infact I absolutely love it, I've a few minor complains like the 2 thumb sticks when pushed toward the center practically hit, and the cord coming out the bottom, though cool on the dreamcast, not so cool on this."
4,Better than Gamecube,I bought these controllers in hopes they would be better than the Gamecube controllers. They were a million times better and easier to use than the Gamecube controllers.
3,"Limited, but extensive use","I actually bought this for use with one game, and I use it a lot. I have loved Mario Cart since it's inception for Super Nintendo. When I got a Wii for a gift, I have played a variety of games adn I'm not a gamer. The interaction is great, but with Mario Carts it''s just plan fun. I now have the Nintendo 64 version which I use this controller and of course Wii Mario Cart. I'll let you know when it become disfunctional, which might be soon considering how much use it gets!"
4,Excellent accessory,It is a very complete accessory and comfortable in use. Unfortunately it depends of a main control through wire connection.
1,Don't buy for gamecube games,"I bought this controller specifically to enjoy my gamecube games. It was designed to be compatible with gamecube (two analog sticks) and yet doesn't work with the gamecube emulator. Why two joysticks and only support up to n64? Most wii games don't even support it. This makes no sense to me, if nintendo added gamecube support with a firmware update or with some sort of adapter I'd give it 5 stars, but I find the design misleading and wasted my money on it. be careful."
3,Nothing new here.,"Don't waste your money on this if you already have any GameCube controllers. More importantly, Nintendo will no doubt release a wireless version of these same controllers in under a year. So think twice before Nindendo has you spending more money than you counted on."
2,It's pretty and reasonably well made but horrible ergonomics.....,"Well, I bought a game (Geometry Wars) that wasn't compatible with the Gamecube controller, and I went out and bought this. It might be okay for kids, but it is too small for me and the shape is bad for holding on to it. Gamecube controllers might have been a little small, but they have a good grip. After using this I decided to go back to using the regular Wii controller and nunchuck. Should have come with a removable modern grip."
4,Nicely made. Underutilized.,"I quite like this controller, maybe not as much as the gamecube controller (which is one of my favorite controllers ever made) but it's still pretty damn good. My only real complaint is the lack of compatibility with my Wii games. I understand the Wii is supposed to be focused on motion sensing but if I don't want the waggling gimmicks I shouldn't be forced to play that way, I thought that was the point of the classic controller. Even in Twilight Princess, a game that was also on the gamecube, you can't use a gamecube or a classic controller to play it on the Wii. It doesn't make sense that a game that was also programmed for play with a gamecube controller can't be played with one on the Wii, but I digress..."
3,Wii Classic Controller,"Good idea, badly executed. The Wii Classic Controller feels very light in your hands. It is needed to play some of the games from Nintendo's Virtual Console so if anyone is interested in downloading games you will need this controller. The problem I have with it is that it plugs into the Wii remote instead of the Nintendo Wii. Using it means you have the Wii remote dangling on the other end of the Wii Classic Controller. The unit seems large enough to hold it's own battery so it should have been ""wire free"". I have dropped or come close to dropping my Wii remote using the Classic controller many times. You can't use the wrist strap because the Wii remote is only used for menu options. Needs redesign badly."
3,Ok if you don't have a GC controller,"I got this because my GC controller is not wireless and I have downloaded a few of the virtual console games. While the wireless was nice, the feel of the controller was nothing like a NES/SNES controller and I found more comfort with my stock GC one. The respose of the controller is great but since you are tethered to the Wiimote, it has that wired feel. If I could redo my purchase, I would spend a little more and buy a wireless GC controller."
3,Buy a Gamecube controller instead,"Two things prevent this from being a good controller as far as I'm concerned. Firstly, you plug it into the Wii remote, instead of directly into the console (the GC controller is plugged directly into the console). This means you depend on batteries to use the controller. Secondly, the Wii is capable of playing Gamecube games, but this controller however is not. The Gamecube controller can be used with all Wii/Gamecube/Virtual Console-games where you need a gamepad. Bottom line: I don't see any reason not to buy a Gamecube controller instead."
4,A good peripheral controller for the Classic Games,"Controller is very comfortable to hold; puts off a real 'Super Nintendo' era vibe when using; very durable; plugs into wireless Wii-mote, thus keeping the wireless setup; Perfect response in interaction...a good buy."
4,Classic Look n Feel,It's Classic snes-like design makes it real comfortable to hold (a tad on the 'small' size compared to current standards).The promise of using it for any of the classic VC games and some of the new games coming along the wii makes it a worth-while accessory to have.
2,Love my Wii - hate this controller.,"This has to be one of the most uncomfortable controllers made. Sadly it's required to play lots of old classic games. Make sure to get the grip addon thing I think Nyko makes it, it makes this controller at least bearable."
2,"sucks, not same buttons","not same buttons as n64, so pretty lame.I was really hoping to play some ocarina of time on it."
3,Midgit Controller,"i orderd two of these, so far only one came, and i held it in my hand its small as hell, its gonna be fallin out my hand and hurting my hands, its made for little kids or midgits i think.the second one thats coming im just gonna have to send back or see if i can take it back somewhere else to get full price back.my brother is gonna bring me some gamecube controllers soon those will be alot better for me"
2,Do not buy this controller - Buy a Wavebird!,"You don't need this controller! Buy a Gamecube Wavebird and you will be much happier. The Gamecube controllers work for all Virtual Console games, but this controller DOES NOT work for Gamecube games! You can also use your Wii remote for many Virtual Console games.Don't waste your money!"
4,A must-have for Virtual Console,"If you're going to play a lot of Virtual Console stuff, specifically old SNES and NES stuff, you've got to get this -- it's so much more comfortable than playing with the Wiimote. One note of caution, though -- it takes some getting used to on SMB, because they programmed the buttons oddly, so that the two buttons you'd intuitively put your fingers on aren't the two you're supposed to use. I find that I have to play that game with my right hand twisted a bit sideways to find the right buttons. Other games, such as SMW, seem to have it right, though."
3,Great for the price but the cord get's in the way.,"I agree with the last review that buying a wireless gamecube controller is a better idea. If you are looking for that classic nes feel, you may prefer this over the gamecube controller but I see no other reason to get one of these. Also, the cord is very annoying coming out the bottom of the controller. They should have made it a foot longer and made it come out the top."
4,Nice product,"I like the controller, although a game cube controller which would of been cheaper, though this is just like using a wireless controller since it plugs into the wii remote, it does feel a little cheaper than id like, hardly used it yet :PBut overall its nice to have for some games"
3,"""Classic"" meaning ""Rare"".","Wii ""Classic"" Controller is right, classic meaning ""OLD"". Unless the game you buy has an option to add this control than you can use it. Maybe as time goes by there will be more games that will let you add this controller to it."
3,controller,"not alot of things you can do with this controller, most games need the remote and nunchuck"
2,Uhhhh....,"This controler was not exactly good to me. I didnt wait long for it to get here. I was looking forward to using it for Resident Evil 4.... But now as I use it, I just can't help but get annoyed even using it....If you started playing RE4 with the normal remote... Then stick to it, far better than this"
1,Doesn't work,I bought this to use with the Super Mario Bros WII game. It is NOT COMPATIBLE. What good is it if you can't use it with the WII games.
1,Clasic controller is a flop,The Wii Clasic Controler is terrible. They did not develop the joy stick to work with packman. It is not worth the money they charged
2,Too little substance...,"I suppose that my expectations of this book set me up...I was hoping for a substantive exposure to stoicism. This is not that book. Instead the author breezes through each significant figure in the history of this school of philosophy and gives us highlights but little of substance. I would recommend that the reader who is seeking to understand stoicism and apply the insights of this dynamic school of philosophy would be better served by reading and applying the exercises found within a course taught by Keith Seddon ""Stoic Serenity: A Practical Course on Finding Inner Peace."" The text for this course can be found on Amazon.com."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book because I am studying Stoicism and wanted to read some modern works. Unfortunately, all I learned from it was the author's philosophical views. It was apparent from the beginning that his understanding of Stoicism is superficial at best. If you really want to learn the Stoic art of living read something written by a Stoic, either ancient or modern."
2,I'm not impressed.,"If you really want to know about Stoicism, skip this book. Go to the original stuff by Epictetus (Loeb Classical Library) or Marcus Aurelius (The Emperor's Handbook) instead."
5,A very excellent book on contemplative practice...,I have read and re-read this book many times and it always amazes me the gems of wisdom that it contains. Gregory Mayers presents a simple path to contemplative practice that has enriched my religious and daily life significantly. The wisdom of the desert fathers is profound in its applications to modern life and especially to modern religions.
1,Turns spirituality to psychobabble,Mayers takes the essentially simple sayings of the desert fathers and mothers and goes off on psychological tangents that often seem to have little to do with the sayings themselves. I took little away from the psychological essays that I felt could help to deepen my spirituality. A better way to approach these sayings is to read them as presented by Thomas Merton in The Wisdom of the Desert and let the sayings alone speak as meditations to your heart.
5,My favorite,"I've been a fan of this soap for about 5 years now. It smells so delicious that every morning shower is a welcome procedure, whether I am awake or not. It cleanses so well that my skin literally squeaks. And it's so huge, it barely fits in the palm of my hand. Great product."
1,Whatever you think a one deserves...,"is far greater than this product should get...Just as the other reviews stated, it's worthless...don't buy it."
1,Don't buy. Waste of time.,HDD Read error when opened the box.I searched the internet and found it hapened to many others (I made a mistake not searching about the prodcut before purchase).No resolution was suggested.I packed it back and shipped it for refund.
1,Quality Control No Good,"I have to mirror the previous posters; after ordering one of these and having it give a HDD Read Error after charging, I returned it to get a new one and had the same thing happen with the newer unit. Stay away from this one; units are no good."
3,I agree more with Zack's review,"This film, while definitely not action packed, is still definitely worth watching if you research the film a little first to understand some of the symbolism. I agree that at times this movie is drawn out and slow, but the twist with Fumiya at the end made the movie worthwhile for me.I think Sayori's hate inspiring jealousy could of been more developed in the story line, but i thought the ending wrapped everything up nicely.This is not a movie I personally would recommend to someone who wasn't a die-hard Japanese cinema fan, although I did enjoy it."
3,pretty good movie,"I though shikoku was pretty decent, it's not that scary, but there are some creepy scenes and it does invoke fright. If your a big Japanese horror film fan then this movie is worth buying, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you."
5,What a Suspenseful Ride,"I'm beginning to become more and more interested in the Japanese style horror/mystery movies. However I wouldn't go as far to say this was a full blow horror movie. Nonetheless it had some very scary scenes at times. which was very thrilling/ end of seat moment's, I was always trying to anticipate the next scene, how the detectives weer doing."
4,Entertaining and fun!,"This book really hits home for anyone who has ever suffered through the early years of post-collegiate, young adulthood. From New York to Philly and back again, through apartment mishaps and dating disasters, between Catholic school and a first job, this book is hilarious and easy to read. I think that most twentysomethings will be able to relate to most of the anecdotes in this book, and will enjoy Ms Lopez's engaging and witty writing style."
4,Time Travel Lite,"I generally like stories about time travel, or variations such as alternate history. In John Varley's Millennium, I particularly liked the snatch team leader Louise Baltimore. I liked her because of her super competent, no excuses accepted, unsentimental attitude.However, I do have a bone to pick. Varley depicts a linear, single-stream time flow, which by definition would be prone to undergoing paradoxes. I can understand this in the time of H. G. Wells, but with modern theoretical physics proposing such concepts as multiple time lines with each having different probabilites, it seems to me to be rather simplistic. For more information, please check out Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics.Nevertheless, I still like the book and would recommend it highly."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A book that has two viewpoings, the future, and the past. People fromthe future have need for more people, so they look to the past, inaccident situations etc.Some present day investigators get involved when the future types make an error, and have to come back to fix it."
3,The view of a High School Student,"I was there reading my SUMMER READING list when i picked saw the title, Millenium. (I aslo read 2001 Space Odyssey which was very good) and i am very interested in the year 2000 itself. I decided to read this book. First, with the immoratal line, don't judge a book by its cover, this book has nothing to do with the millenium. Second, its a very hard to understand, difficult book, i do not recommend it."
3,Varley's weakest novel,"It's a clever enough conceit -- bodies in a plane crash are ""lost"" to their time, and are thus available, one way or another, to time travellers in need -- but there's little to this novel beyond that, other than yet another chance for Varley to contemplate the relationship between man and God.Normally, a clever idea and a big theme are all Varley needs to get rolling, with fascinating bits of invention, realer-than-real characters and a compelling plot almost falling over each other in a rush to get onto the page. Not here.Compared to the Gaea Trilogy or ""Steel Beach,"" ""Millennium"" feels anemic, as though this were a Varley short story stretched to short novel length by another writer.Still, it's better than the movie."
3,So so,I agree with the one reviewer that this is like a short story that was dragged out into a novel. There just isn't enough muscle to move the story along.
4,post millenial,"I disagree with the other writers. I have read a lot of Varley and think this is just about his best. The Titan series was very enjoyable but also very adolescent (nothing against teen agers, mind you, I find the T & A in Titan tiresome). Anyway, Millenium is an interesting, well thought out, time travel book, with some very original premises. It seems sort of goofy at first, but ties together very well by the end. The characters are real people (even sherman, the robot!), and they act in beleivable ways. The plot is well thought out, moves along at a good clip, doesn't get too bogged down in the complexities of time travel, and has a reasonably fulfilling ending. What more could you want? Ophiuchi Hotline was my 2nd favorite of Varley's. Steel Beach was a real disappointment."
5,Interesting Characters and Plot + Surprise Ending,"I became a hard-core sci-fi fan in the 1950s. Since then, my reading has become more discriminating. This book meets my much higher standards for a good read for several reasons. First, I liked the character of Louise Baltimore. Second, I liked Varley's telling of this tale through alternating points-of-view in alternating chapters. I liked the plot, and finally I liked the last chapter, where a final character emerges to tie it all together by revealing the things not seen in the characters povs."
5,Fantastic & real in this time of Mafia decline,"Mr Turkus pre-emptively has one-upped Peter Maas and Joseph Valachi in this book. Written in 1950, it tells the unbelieveable story of how the Mob solidified and the murderers that made it work. And it tells of the aftermath, the early days of the Mob eating itself alive...no one gets out. Incredibly informative and lightened by Mr Turkus's narrative and emotion. Exciting and brutal..."
4,Riveting,The most riveting book I've read on the creation & operations of the early stages of the Mafia.
4,HONEST ABE--fell---------library book,"auth--TURKUS & FEDER--512 pgs (LONG)-7/31/2003.MURDER INC.--the name the press gave to OrganizedCrime hired killers. 1929 to 1934.400 to 1,000 CONTRACT KILLs.

4,One of the first,Very interesting in that the style of writing reminds one of gangster movies of the period. Definitely a classic of the genre that has stood the test of time.
4,Outdoor Camera Housing,The camera housings were delivered in a good amount of time. We especially like that the lids open from the side since it allows us to mount the boxes closer up under the eaves. There is still plenty of space to access the camera for maintenance without having to take down the box. Very nice design feature.
4,Beautiful and Inspiring,"The Art of the Loom is really inspirational for a beginning weaver like myself. There are beautiful color and black and white photographs of stunning pieces from around the world and throughout time, and people weaving on many different types of traditional looms. There are also illustrations explaining how much of the weaving is done, although many of them were difficult for me to digest as I am brand new at weaving. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in traditional and multi-cultural weaving."
2,interim report,"The Tasco Specialty 200x Tel-Toy is somewhere between a toy and a telescope. ""Surprisingly lightweight,"" my enthusiastic 5-year-old granddaughter said, carrying it to her room. In fact, the tripod is too light; it's unstable. Lack of written instructions for assembly was a major disappointment, given the many parts, interchangeable lenses, etc. I'm still hopeful that trial and error will prove that this toy can function enough like a telescope to satisfy an avidly curious child. Further comments to follow."
4,"Great book, average CD.","Well organized and easy to follow. Play along tracks sound average at best. I would have like better effort there. All in all, a great study tool!"
3,Kindle Blues Bass -- part way there,"Ed Friedland is a great teacher. I have several print books that he wrote. They came with CDs of the audio tracks referenced in the book. These tracks are a very important part of the book.I was very disappointed to find that the CD tracks were not a part of the Kindle version. To buy this book like this is like buying a NYT-top selling hardback and discovering that you were given the abridged version as you walked out of the store. i have looked around the Kindle site and have not found any link to download this integral part of the book.I also bought ""R&B; Bass Masters"", and it is the same--no audio tracks, and these tracks are clearly referenced in both Kindle books with numbered CD icons. If these books were complete, I would probably give them 5 stars, but I feel that without these tracks, they maybe are not even worth the 3 stars that I gave."
5,From Brazil,The book is great. The material is great. I do like Ed Friedland materials. I always buy books from him.
5,A must have for beginners,"If you want to learn the foundations of rock, pop, blues and jazz, you gotta learn blues bass. This instruction book is excellent in getting you started. I'm only half way through it and I'm having a blast. For the price, it's a steal of a deal. Keep thumpin'."
2,Nothing revealed.,"This is a TV movie covering the career, life and afterlife of the illusionist Harry Houdini/Ehrich Weiss. It is a romanticized skeletal treatment, covering the basics of the man (raised in poverty, self taught magician, life long mother issues, medium debunker) without any real depth or showing anything new. It is a well done enough production, recreating some of Houdini's daring feats, and the acting is decent (and Johnathon Schaech certainly looks fit enough to pull off Houdini's escapes and high tolerance for pain) but ultimately it is a frame without a portrait, non revealing of the Ehrich behind the Harry.Favorite Line: ""I fell in love with Ehrich Weiss; I put up with Harry Houdini."""
2,impressive-looking clunker,"Got mine for free. Worth every penny. Wrong manual was enclosed. The ""right"" manual was available on the ""support"" section of Tasco.com, but not very helpful. The mounting for the spotter scope is in the wrong position on the lens barrel, so that the mount can't slide back and forth. The radial adjustment tightening knob is tiny, hard to use. Good for looking at the moon, or the sun (just kidding!) or maybe nearby mountaintops (not that I live near any). If you want to look at distant galaxies or the rings of Saturn, you're better off looking at the pretty pictures of those celestial bodies on the box."
2,Shrunk to 1/2 the size! And faded alot,Washed and dried this delicately and it shrunk to 1/2 the origional size. And faded terribly. It's adorable - but it must be hand washed in cold water and hang dry!
1,Get out the bugspray!,"I mistakenly purchased Rand McNally 2000 thinking it was the updated version of the software I have been using for years. I had so many problems in the first 2 days, I called customer service who walked through all my problems and came up with the same bugs on her end - she agreed with the problems, but had no idea how to fix them! One example is the measuring tool between 2 points - it doesn't work on the icon, only around it, which leaves up to a 1.5 mile variance in any given direction! After telling her how frustrated and dissapointed I was with this software, she gave me the address to return the product for full refund (90 day guarantee).Later, I realized it was Microsofts trip planner 98 and Streets 98 that I had been using. I am ordering the Microsoft 2000 version today (and returning the other product). According to other bad reviews for Rand McNally 2000 and the great reviews for Microsoft, I am not alone!"
3,Didn't work,"Not the sellers fault. This program will not load on my Vista Home Pemium. Seller was fast, package well wrapped"
2,Forget it,"Save your pittance and put it into something like Mark Berent's ""Rolling Thunder"", which also has the advantage of 4 sequels.Give it 100 pages to get started, and 99%-on you will be looking for the first sequel Steel Tiger for sale on Amazon.There is no comparison, Dancer is a cardboard war comic in novel-form"
2,anoying,when I try to put this together it is completely anoyingit will not go together !!!!!! if it was up to me I thinkyou shouldn't buy it.completly frustrating.
3,product effectiveness,I bought this for my flare up psoriasis to remove the severe itch and and relief from the lesions on my scalp. I didn't like the product - seem to itch more after application.
5,Best Season EVER,"Hello everyone and welcome to what is probably the funniest season of the king of queens to date. Doug finally conquers his fears of being a bartender and makes an alcoholic feel bad for ordering a non alcoholic drink on his first order, it's hilarious. So many great episodes so little time but once you start watching this show you will never stop becasue it hooks you very quickly. Carrie gains a few pounds and Doug and Lou Ferigno take advantage of the exercise time, what more could you want , Order a copy now and if you haven't ordered the other seasons bring em on home!!"
5,"Quick, reliable, and in good shape","As I said in the title, the order was promptly processed, arrived at my door in a timely manner, and was in excellent condition."
5,best sitcom ever...period,Love this sitcom....nver really watched it will it was on the air but now I can't get enough.
2,Dont Waste your Money,"This Season I think started the downhill fall for the Comedy Series King of Queens. This season had some of the dumbest and most boring episodes ever. Doug and Carrie argue WAYYYYY to much now and its hurtful arguing and not funny, stuppid arguing. Deacon rarely shows up and I miss that! :(. So what I basically trying to say is that this Season is not very good. Thats just my opinion"
3,KofQ S07 - Jumped the Shark,"I have all seasons of King of Queens and have watched them many times.Kevin James' comedy skews way too young and silly for me when left to his own devices but in this series, with the writing and the other fun characters, it works.It seemed noticeable with Season 7 that the writing had changed and the other characters,aside from Leah were not used as much. Just last night watching episodes 1 to 7 of Season 7, it seemed like a different show. I know that Seasons 7 to 9 had their moments and treasured episodes but the best were the first 6 Seasons. And why was Season 9 cut short? Likely there was plenty going on in the background with the production. I've noticed with other comedy shows, they over-reach after 6 years.That said, I will always keep the King of Queens dvd sets handy for a laugh."
4,Para los amantes del Guaka Rock!!!,"Me imagino que ellos no han de vender mucho en esta página gringa, pero la verdad este es uno de los mejores discos de la botella, se los recomiendo!!!"
2,Not a VC++ book,If you buy this book hoping to learn VC++; you are heading for disappointment! This book deals more with C/C++ then VC++. The title is totally misleading.
5,Wrong book,"Well, this is the wrong book if you are an expert C++ programmer. However, as a beginner looking for a complete reference and a good treatment of C++ I found this book to be excellant.Very well styled, easy to read, lots of examples, lots of topics!!!!!, and a great index."
1,Nowhere near complete,"This is a 27 chapter book. For the first 20 chapters the authors cover C and C++, with no coverage of MS VC++. For the last 7 chapters, they try to touch on every concept in VC++ without actually explaining anything. Numerous times the authors will give an example and then tell the student to use that program as a template, instead of bothering to explain the calls that the program makes. The coverage of VC++ material does not give enough information to assist anyone in creating a useful program. As for coverage of complex topics, DLLs and threads each get their own sentence.I am a professional C developer who has been programming for a long time. Hands down, this is the worst programming book that I have ever read."
2,"Title questionable, has 107 C programs and 98 C++ programs","Amazing that the writers could not break lose from C programming. Unfortunately they did present most of their examples in the C-language. I counted all C and C++ programs. Easy to see what is C, having C filename extension and stdio header files while C++ programs having CPP filename extension and mostly iostream, or other stream related header files."
1,"Lots of info, but where???","As this book is called ""The Complete Reference"" for C++, I bought it, hoping to use it as a reference when I needed to remember how a certain function or keyword worked. And where do you usually go if you want reference?The index. The dreaded index.This book has *THE* worst index I have ever seen in a book. Reading the 16 page table of contents is a better way to find a particular subject. Want to know about ""copy constructor""? Not in the index. ""const""? Not there. ""Conversions""? ""Doc/View""? One page each. There IS a lot of information in this book, but you really have to want it."
1,"This book is not a reference book, nor is it useful","If you are looking for a Visual C++ reference book do not buy this one. It does not cover a wide range of topics (dll's are mentioned as being too advanced so much for complete) and is written as a text book rather than a reference book. This book may be suitable for someone who has no experience with C++ and is trying to learn the basics, but even then there must be better, more accurate books out there. The only complete thing about it is a complete waste of money."
1,Certainly not for Visual C++ beginners,"I started my C++ adventures with ""Ivor Horton's Beginning C++ : The Complete Language ANSI/ISO Compliant (Wrox Beginning Series)"" and found that book to be very helpful, easy to follow and informative. Unfortunately that book didn't have any Visual C++ 6 specifics, which then lead me to purchase this book.With C and C++ background, I initially started reviewing the Visual C++ specifics in this book. Unfortunately, I could not follow the authors' thought process, so I started the C++ specifics, and again, had to stop, regressing to the beginning of the book.Eventually, I gave up on the book. My conclusion is that the authors are unable to convey simple concepts, and have a knack for complicating even the most basic concepts. I would strongly dissuade beginner-level programmers from purchasing this book!"
1,Bad,"I have been a C programmer for years, know a little C++ so thought this would be a good intro to Visual C. It is not. It's pathetic. Things are introduced out of nowhere, delving into the guts of windows include files without even simple explanations. To make any sence of this book you would have to already have years of experience in C++, yet it is supposedly for people of any ability. I wanted to know how to draw some simple dialog boxes, and how to get the user supplied info into a C/C++ program to use...I think I have even less idea of how to do that now than I did before I wasted my $ on this 'reference' (lol)."
3,Mixed Bag,"As a whole, Dimension of Miracles is not a great novel. If you picked it up because Douglas Adams cited it as one of his inspirations, you would surely be disappointed. Adams tied up his plot into a neat package. Dimension of Miracles ends lamely as if Sheckley had unexpectedly reached the 65,000 word limit that was common in genre publishing during the 1960s. There is a tremedously dull patch about 50 pages in where the characters talk about philosophical/cosmological premises like stoned college sophmores. If I had not grown to love Sheckley through his short stories, I probably would have given up the book there. However, the book has some very funny episodes that make it worth trudging through the tedium. I especially like the city-scale AI who smothered her inhabitants with kindness. And the final episode, where the protagonist rejects his home once it reaches it, has a strange reasonance in an America that is mired today in 2006 in a new Vietnam."
1,Worst book I've read in a long time,"Once I start reading a book I usually finish it. In this case I made an exception, as after 50 pages this book was too painful to continue. Featuring cardboard characters, paper thin plot and flat prose, this book reads like something that a thirteen-year-old would write for his friends. Please please please avoid reading!"
3,Work good and look good,"Work good and look good but was disappointed with the chome started showing rust in less than 3 weeks. So i really have to keep clean and waxed, would pay a little more for beter chrome"
5,Can't get any better than Alice Faye,"While I'm not thrilled with the cover, I so enjoyed hearing some tunes that I hadn't heard Alice Faye sing before and several that I do have on other CD's, I can't go lower than 5 stars for lovely Alice. What a voice! Since there are a few songs from 42nd Street, you get a glimpse of what she could have accomplished at Warners Bros, if things had been different. Since you're told from the title, the selections are from screen and radio, the sound isn't studio sharp, but Alice Faye is always quality listening."
4,Grace and Beauty,"The quality of the images, and the information provided with them makes this a very good book overall. As a painter, I bought this book to study the details of the images, and I am pleased with it. The first 80 pages are largely a series of academic and somewhat wordy essays exploring aspects of Raphael's life, paintings, evidence and conjecture about his models. The remaining 100 pages is devoted to a selection of exceptional images, with a full page explanation provided on the facing page. The printing detail and color rendition are superb, with no grain visible to my eye, and with enlarged details for many pictures on subsequent pages. Full histories are provided on the facing page for most of the images in this book. All that is missing from my point of view is an index, a list of illustrations, and a brief introduction to the artist."
5,great,"gave this as a gift, it was well received! shipped fast and the quality of it for the price was great! i plan to purchase one for myself!"
4,Perfect size,This rolling pin works great. Keep it floured well when using but keep in mind not every dough is the same. Good quality and look forward to many years of service.
5,Beats a regular pin,"I bought this on a whim, as it was cheap enough, and constantly on my recommended list. I didn't realize how much easier it would make it to roll dough out into a round shape. Of course, thinking about it, it makes sense, as it squeezes less as you get away from the center, naturally shaping the dough into a more elliptical/circular shape, than a regular flat rolling pin. Furthermore, versus my older rolling pin, the siding/rolling motion under my hands is far more comfortable than holding the handles of the more traditional pin.I don't think I'll be using my traditional pin anymore.As for this one, the quality of the wooden pin is fine. Straight, smooth, with no splinters. Even color as well."
4,Nice,"It does its job, is very smooth so I'm not worried about splinters, but I kind of wish I had opted for a bigger one. It seems larger in the picture, but when you're trying to roll out the dough . . . I don't know, just think about a bigger one first."
5,Perfect Rolling Pin!,"I was looking for a simple and sturdy rolling pin for my holiday pies. I have never had my crusts come out so smooth and even as with this pin! It's incredibly easy to get the hang of this pin, and I found that my crusts cooked more evenly, as well. Other reviews cited splinters, but I didn't find any on mine. I suggest using a lot of flour during your first test run and using minimal water during cleaning."
5,Love it!,Rolling pizza dough with this rolling pin was perfect! The dough came out even thickness and round. And it's so easy with this rolling pin! Well worth the money!
4,Terrific rolling pin!,"I love the design of the french rolling pin. It requires a bit more dexterity to use than the traditional rolling pin with handles that you hold steady & the center that rolls independently of them, but it gets the job done. Made well and not terribly heavy like a marble rolling pin can be."
1,Not a Gryffindor scarf,We ordered this thinking it would be maroon and gold. When we got them they are a kind of purple color and gold not at all Gryffindor colors. We were unable to use them for what we had planned. Very disappointing!!!!
2,not a gryffindor scarf,"If you expect the red and yellow colors from the movie, you'll be dissappointed. My daughter's scarf arrived as purple and orange. Normally, I wouldn't complain, but the robe we ordered with it are clearly red and yellow."
1,Terrible.,"I brought this for my mom, and she's about in her mid thirties.She's a huge fan of Harry Potter, and was expecting a great deal out of it when she saw the pictures.The colors of the tie wasn't burgundy and gold, the colors were Orange and purple, extremely depressing."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I had high hopes for this scarf, I was getting it for a friend for a Christmas present, she saw it on a youtube video and fell in love with it.I thought it was going to be a nice burgundy and bright gold with thick, soft material.Boy, was I wrong.It turned out a weird purple with yellow stripes.Harry Potter? I think not.It didn't even have the insignia on it or anything.It came in a flimsy USPS plastic baggy and was absolutely tiny and thin when I took it out of the bag.I should have spent my money elsewhere, there was no quality or aesthetics to this item."
5,A great trio of MST3K,"The Wild Wild World of Batwoman highlights this impressive three pack of MST3K. Each movie reprented here is a campy 1960's stinker well deserving of the MST3K treatment. A cinematic repository of astronauts, overdone generalizations, and lots and lots of go-go dancing. Don't miss this."
3,"Not her best, but still a couple of good songs","I must admit that I was a bit disappointed when I bought this CD. The only song that reaches the standard of her previous album 'Libre' isthe nicely arranged 'Despertar'. Other songs that deserve to be mentioned are 'Cuando Dos Van A Muerte', 'Pasa La Vida' and 'Amigo'. But the teamwork with producer Miguel Blasco and songwriters Valle/Sánchez is definitely past its peak: The album generally lacks the punch of its predecessor, and the sound is a bit limp on some songs. Positive things on 'Enorme' is the bagpipe on 'Corazones Rotos', which gives the song a different feel, and the occasional use of a horn section. Though not Alejandra's best effort, I still recommend it for faithful fans. END"
2,Telling but Lacking,"While the book does explore the personal experiences of those suffering in pain adeptly, the author and contributors fail to include many sides of this complex issue of the way pain in our society is viewed and why it is so. I would say there is a limited scope at best. The book assumes for instance that addiction is a separate disease when in fact many patients in pain have co existing addiction problems past or present which clouds the issues inherent in prescribing opiates obviously. Further, there is growing acceptance currently for the theory that ""disease"" is a term applied to addiction too freely, apparently a trend not limited to outside of this book. Also I note a glaring lack of references. I recall seeing similar discourse and material discussed in several separate magazine articles and web blogs unrelated to this author, pre dating the publishing of this book. Not all original premises but certainly a valiant attempt to have an all inclusive resource."
5,delectable,"grab your hot cocoa and snuggle up with this book and your favorite blankie. i'm not a faerie fanatic but could not resist this book. the level of creativity shown here is overwhelming and you will find yourself 'ooooing' and 'aaaahing' and giggling at the turn of every page. lovely, lovely book.oh, and if you're a faerie, these two ladies are the ones you want if you're doing any redecorating."
2,tiffen 77mm ultra clear water white protection filter,This filter arrived in used condition. It had adhesive on both sides of the glass surface as well as accumulated dirt around the edges of the glass perimeter. It took over an hour to clean with lens tissue. I take much pride in my optics and am disappointed in Amazon for this situation.
1,Ghosts!,"Bought this filter in combination with a deal here at Amazon. I chose not to buy the cheapest UV filter for protection, but I chose this somewhat more expensive filter. Shouldn't have done that either. After putting it on my great little 50mm 1.8d lens it had some serious ghosting, even at the smallest amount of light from reflections or even bright objects other than the sun. When I removed it the image was perfect again. I do not recommend this filter. Buy the Nikon 52mm NC filters. Much better!!"
5,MAX PROTECTION FOR OTHER FILTERS,"WANTED A FILTER THAT WOULD NOT EFFECT THE QUALITY OF SHOT I WAS TAKING. ALSO I WANTED MAXIMUM PROTECTION FOR MY SINGH-RAY AND B+W CIR. POL. FILTERS IN CASE PROTECTION IS NEEDED!! I HAVE IT WITH THIS FILTER!! GOOD QUALITY, AND GREAT PRICE!! DELIVERED ON TIME!! JIM D SMITH"
2,"I love it, but it causes problems...","I love the sleeve because it's thin, feels great, is very easy to slide on and off, protects the whole iPod yet you can easily see the screen and use the touch-wheel.BUT... I've had a lot of problems w/ my iPod ever since I bought this sleeve, and when I remove the sleeve the problem goes away. Sound weird? Maybe, maybe not. The reason you can slide your finger along the outside of the sleeve and still have the touch-wheel pick up your movements is STATIC. I think that this static is causing the iPod to malfunction.I've gotten ""sad ipod"" icons, I've had it freeze up, I've had it go as far as selecting ""Play"" on a file but not play, all kinsa of malfunctions. However, remove this sleeve and the iPod returns to normal function.It's ashame, because the sleeve itself is awesome.I have not done a scientific test on the sleeve, this is just my observation/my experience."
5,A handy guide to spanish!!,"This book is just perfect for your visit to Mexico! With all of the introductory vocabulary and conjugations, this reference guide is just what you need to feel comfortable and confident with your spanish. Not too wordy, and clear with explanations, you'll want to take this book everywhere on your spanish adventures!"
5,"See, Lacan can be salvaged from misogyny","I was hesitant to read this book when I saw the rating the reviewer below me gave to it. However, I've now learned that you can't always trust those who review books on amazon (common sense, I guess). I actually used this book ""Jacques Lacan: A feminist intro"" for my honors thesis this year at college. It has to be one of the books I relied on the most for my research. Lacan's concepts are always hard to get a handle on, but Grosz's book, along with anything written by Slavoj Zizek, serves as a great introduction to this French thinker's psychoanalytic theories. Also, this book shows (with good evidence too) that even though Lacan has some phallocentric ideas (okay, a lot of them), his work is still valuable to feminists and modern theory in general. I would definitely recommend."
5,"A vibrant, enthusiastic, and candid guide","Tamara Dorris' Girl Gets World: Becoming A Better You is a practical self-help book for women who are ready to achieve more success in their lives. Individual chapters address the importance of prioritizing health over beauty, finding balance in one's personal and professional lives, understanding exactly what success means to you in order to better focus on attaining your goals, and more. A vibrant, enthusiastic, and candid guide, Girl Gets World is strongly recommended reading for any woman of any age or background life experiences wanting to advance themselves in their chosen areas of opportunity or responsibility, as well as generally improving the qualities and satisfactions of their personal and professional lives."
3,Good. A bit bulky. Doesn't hold enough.,"I'm used to the standard messenger bag which you can pack full of stuff. I like the single sling backpack style, but it seems to be a bit bigger than it needs to be and it doesn't hold as much as its many pockets suggest. Gets crammed quickly."
1,Zipper is porrly made.,"The zipper sticks like crazy. If you plan on using the bag, plan on the zipper breaking.Save yourself the time and get an incase sling bag instead."
4,Nice bag,"I purchased this backpack for work as I needed something sleek and compact, but big enough to carry a decent amount of stuff. This back fits the bill. It is well made and comfortable to carry. I use this to carry a tablet instead of a laptop. It looks nice and has good form and function, so I have no complaints."
2,Cute but poorly made laptop backpack,"I purchased this bag to carry my 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro to and from school. Initially, I was very happy with the bag, but within a week there were several problems. First, the zipper to the laptop storage section of the bag separated from the material in two places less than a week after I received the bag. With each successive use the tears have gotten bigger, and now (three months later) I can no longer use the bag with confidence.I also find the clasp on the over-shoulder strap to be cumbersome and difficult to operate, especially when the bag needs to be removed and put back on often, such as when riding the subway and switching trains.This may be an acceptable bag for someone who a) will not use the backpack often, and (b carries only a laptop and very few other items, but I don't recommend for those that are commuting often and need to carry a laptop and books together."
4,Good Laptop Bag,"The bag looks great and for the most part is very well made. I was a little disappointed by the interior lining of the bag which is a very thin plastic (reminded me of a rain poncho). A higher quality lining and I probably would have given it 5 stars.I took it on a recent business trip as a carry on. The bag has considerable storage for its size. The interior easily accommodated a 14"" Thinkpad, a cooling pad, a legal notepad, and the included zipper pouch held the power cable for the laptop as well as a USB 10 key. The external pocket held my iPhone, iTouch, a 3G JUICE rechargeable battery pack and charging cable, my blue tooth headset and charger, an HP 12C calculator, my ear buds and car keys. Fully packed, it still fit easily under the seat in front of me.The bag has an easily adjustable strap and is very comfortable.Overall, it's a nice bag, just wish they would have included a higher quality lining..."
4,"Durable, but smaller than hoped for","I've had this bag for about 16 months. The zipper finally broke this past weekend because i tried to stuff too much into it. This bag held my laptop, digital camera, mouse, and some more small items just fine. I could NOT, however, keep a charger or spare battery in the bag, because it is too small and bulges outward. I usually keep spare batteries, chargers, and other items i need in a separate bag. In fact, i broke this bag when i tried to fit my laptop, mouse, camera, charger, spare battery, and a pair of sweatpants into the bag (i kid you not!).I'm now buying a new bag, but i won't be buying this bag again, because i need a bigger bag. If you don't have too many accesories for your laptop, this is a good, durable bag."
2,It's not like the pictures!!!,I loved the functions of the bag BUT it's not the same as the pictures here..actually it's ugly. i had to return it back and order to black color!
3,trendy but painful,"If you are looking for a bag that you could carry and walk for long distances, then this is not your right choice. The bag is trendy not too big but the fact that is has only one sholder handle makes carrying a laptop in it as painful as carrying a laptop in a handbag as i used to do. I would recomment the same bag with two sholder handles, that would probably hurt less!"
5,Belkin Laptop SLING BAG,This bag does its job protecting my laptop! great product and great and fast shipping!
4,Great Bag! but...,"I really love this bag. I've taken great care of it but for some reason the sewing near the zipper is coming undone and now I can see inside my bag... I'm no expert at sewing, but I'm going to attempt to fix it. The reason I love this bag is the fact that it feels so light even with my 15"" macbook inside and other items. You can easily fit a notebook in it along with pencils, your laptop charger, and mouse. It has a little hole to slip your headphones from in case you want to listen to music on the go. Very nice design :) I'm just a bit depressed mine is breaking :( I still use it though, lol."
2,Not for short torso people,"This bag is very nice. The compartments are every thing you need. However I'm 5' 3"" and the bag goes from my shoulders down to my hips. So, when I walk with the pack on my back it bounces off my booty! For this reason, I don't wear as a back pack. It kinds defeats the purpose. Not recommended for short torso people."
