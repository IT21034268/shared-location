1,"""Best By"" date soon","I received these bars on October 4th and the ""best by"" date is October 16th. That's a lot of bars to eat in 12 days. Amazon shipped me another order and the date on these 12 boxes is also October 16. It doesn't save any money to buy in bulk if the food is 12 days from expiration."
1,An old book with a new cover,"Although this is represented as a new book (copyright 2001) it is actually a reprinting of the old navy manual that was last revised in 1970! The material may be of interest to some; it was a good manual in its time, but naval engineering has changed a lot since 1970."
1,The Best Of Wado Ryu Karate,"More like negative stars. This DVD is non-Functional. It only plays 10min at a time. The quality of footage is very low. If I could watch the footage of Otsuka Sensei, it would be worth it, but I cannot. The audio commentary is silly. For any who has trained with Suzuki Sensei, or in Japanese karate would know that the terms that the commentators use are incorrect. The most frustrating thing is that even when the DVD was sent back for a better copy it came back with the same errors in playability. I am surprised that Amazon would sell such an untested product. My suggestion is to not buy anything from yamazato-video. It seems that most of their products are unsatisfactory."
1,A complete waste of money!,"If you want to see really high quality footage of the Founder of Wado Ryu Karate performins kata that was filmed by Berkley University (California) in 1965 see Wado Ryu The Way of Peace and Harmony Volumes 1 & 2. Unlike the above, they are professionally produced films from a Southern Californian studio, that you will be proud to own."
1,Pure Junk!!!,"Unfortunately this DVD is just a rip off.The video was recorded from VHS tape & poorly formatted.There are no chapters or any other features that you would expect from a DVD.I was hoping to supplement my Wado Ryu training with the aid of the examples on this DVD, but there is absolutely nothing to gain from this piece of junk!For a great series on Wado Ryu that shows the katas in detail, I highly recommend David Deaton's ""Wado Ryu Karate"" series produced by Panther Productions."
2,unsatisfactory,"The DVD will not play well, it freezes which makes it diffcult to watch some tracks on it"
5,Excelente producto,"Hace mas de 2 años que poseo unaCanon PowerShot A640 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom, esta es mi primera camara digital y lo que aprendi con el uso diario me llevo a la necesidad de comprarme un trípode practico y portátil. Eso me llevo a comprarme elJoby GP3-01EN Gorillapod SLR-Zoom Flexible Tripod for Digital SLR Cameras, el cual al contrario de los modelos 1 y 2 no trae la cabeza flexible para poder ajustar los ejes de vision de la camara.Buscando en la red y leyendo muchos foros, blogs y grupos de flickr, me decidi por comprarme esta cabeza de trípode sin muchas expectativas.La verdad es que funciona a la perfeccion con el Gorillapod3 lo cual lo convierte en casi una compra obligada si posees unos de estos tripodes.La camara se ajusta firme y el sistema de bola permite girar casi a cualquier lugar la misma.En cuanto a la construcción, es muy resistente no es del tipo plástico frágil, se siente muy solido y se nota que resiste el uso intenso."
5,All original artists! Some hard to find tracks in the US!!!,"Yep, all originals here. I took a chance and ordered it, and here's what I got:1. Funkytown-Pseudo Echo2. 9 to 5-Sheena Easton3. Respectable-Mel and Kim4. A Good Heart-Feargal Sharkey (YES! his tracks are completely unavailable in the US!!!)5. Mickey-toni basil6. reckless-australian crawl7. tired of toein the line-rocky burnette8. do you really want to hurt me-culture club9. i wanna wake up with you-boris gardiner10. classic-adrian gurvitz11. please don't go-kc and sunshine band12. turning japanese-vapors13. moscow-genghis khan14. shaddup you face-joe dolce (only time I've ever seen this on CD!!!)"
4,The real deal!,"I was very happy to find and buy this CD. I have been occasionally let down using iTunes to buy some older songs. They were not the original songs I wanted and remembered from their days on the radio. In a few cases it was either a different artist covering the song, or the original artist re-recording the old song. Either way, it was a disappointment. This CD has ALL of the original releases by the original artists. So glad I found it!"
2,Decent cd,"I have many 80s cds, but this one is not one of my favorites. I essentially purchased it for the one song by Rocky Burnette, ""Tired of Toein' the line."" The other songs on the cd I skip right over."
3,"Good Performances, But Not Enough","This is a very frustrating DVD. Just when there's a bit of momentum with the concert footage it cuts away to Zappa pontificating about something or another. Also the close ups are way too close. At one point the camera nearly shows us Ike Willis' tonsils, plus whenever FZ is playing the video is up close and out of focus on his hands. It's good but not great. Hopefully the concert footage will be re-cut and reissued in its entirety."
1,Zappa in Shorts?,"Yes, Zappa in shorts. I am no prude, but to see him on stage wearing a pair of shorts doesn't seem to personify professional musicianship. It is almost as if he has a defiant attitude that he could care less about it. Overall the artistry of the DVD appears that the musicians aren't on stage to perform music, but to simply act outrageous and odd for the camera. Rather immature, not entertaining. I would rather see a concert toned down a little. I saw Zappa at the Palladium 1988 and I was amazed at how low key the show was, I felt very comfortable."
5,Does Humor Belong in Music? Frank Zappa.,"I ordered this for my daughter because she thinks the world of Frank Zappa. Beyond her initial delight, I do not know her reaction. (Sorry)"
4,Decent Zappa DVD,"I'm a little disappointed that there weren't more full songs, but as with most Zappa products I am happy with what I bought."
4,Not my personal favortie but...,"You should probably buy this DVD because you kinda want it and you've been watching that fifth generation dub for years now, it's time to buy a legitimate copy. If you owned a legit copy already, hey you could have it on DVD now.The high points are definately the concret footage, I wasn't so fond of the FBI warnings and all of the corporate logo stuff, but I'm sure some people dig that kind of thing."
3,"when they gonna released ""Roxy and elsewhere"" on dvd????","i put 3 stars because this concert should be entire and had better sound and extras, like the baby snakes dvd.Come on people write a review to request the ""Roxy and elsewhere"" in dvd, is one of the best performances of Frank Zappa, and in the extras of the ""baby snakes"" dvd shows a sampler of this concert"
2,Is it Humor if Nobody Laughs?,"Does Humor Belong in Music? Well, that depends. A more relevant question to help you decide whether this DVD is for you is, Do you think Frank Zappa is funny? I myself don't really think he is, and I am hardly alone in thinking that. If you are one of those people who disagree with me, you may like this, as most of what you get in this DVD is FZ 'humor'. There is very little Zappa guitar soloing here.To me, this document underlines the reasons Zappa more or less lost his credibility with so many people. His arrogance and attempts at humor really undermined his real abilities as a guitarist and frequently interesting compositions, and for the most part the problem only got worse over time. Here we see him in 1984-85, so the problem is fairly advanced.Summary, using only FZ titles:Q: Does Humor Belong in Music?A: Shut Up & Play Your Guitar."
1,I received FUJIFILM recharger. and no batteries.,shipping was really quick butI received FUJIFILM recharger.and no batteries.feel like I got cheated.
4,a good old werewolf film,"This is a good film and the first werewolf film. Yes the plot does wander a bit and the odd humor sticks out in a few scenes, but if you are reading this that probably does not matter to you.The werewolf makeup is minimalistic, yet very effective, and realistic. While this film has its flaws it paved the way for many more horror films to come, so I would give it a 4 out of a 5"
3,Werewolf of London,I saw this on Netflix it's pretty decent but not as exciting to watch as other horror classics of the era still worth a watch. it's not that bad.I like the scene with the cat especially.
2,Disappointing Universal Horror,"Universal's 1935 precursor to ""The Wolf Man"" has some historic interest, but remains among the studio's dullest horror films. Originally intended as a Karloff-Lugosi vehicle, ""Werewolf of London"" is worth a look for Jack Pierce's influential makeup. Character actor Henry Hull delivers a strangely unsympathetic performance in the title role - little helped by Stuart Walker's flat direction. The lack of atmospheric set-pieces make the 75-minute running time seem like an eternity. ""Werewolf of London"" truly needed Boris and Bela's potent star power."
3,Good not great,This [(~WAS~)] a good game when i got it but it got boring pretty fast. IT's a good game but there's not enough variety its to easy at the beginning and its to hard at the end it wasn't that good of a game.
5,GOOD LORD!!!!,"this game is incredible. i love it so much, and belive it or not im playing it right now! the graphics are amazing for such a small thing, and the gameplay is very very good. i recommend it for anyone."
5,Sweet,"It takes some pretty sweet graphics for me to be ""amazed"" by a game and this game did just that. I watched the video at ign.com and i couldn't believe it. I could honestly tell you that if someone showed me the video and didn't tell me what console it was for i would guess Dreamcast or PS2. I don't know how they did it but they did. .... ...."
4,GREAT GAME BUT BUY THREE,this game is great is has lots of great features like lots of new levels that a lot bigger and better then the ones in number one but still in number two the charecter is sort of hard to see but in three its easier to see the charecter and its in 3D
4,Awsome Game!!!!,This game is soooo cool! I got this game for my birthday and it is awsome! It doesn't have as good as graphics as THPS1 for PSX but their pretty good.
2,Worst Tony Hawk version,"I am sickened that the average score for this game based on everyone's reviews is 5 stars. Are you KIDDING ME? First off, this stupid isometric psuedo-3d view is INFURIATING. Good luck lining up those big rails and jumps, or any half-pipe for that matter. You'll have a great time flying off the edge of the ramp because you can't line up your skater straight to the jump. All those objectives that took a week to complete on the console versions will take you a month on this terrible platform. Get used to doing the Start-Retry thing cause you'll be doing it a lot. There's not nearly as many tricks in this abbreviated version, the boards are sometimes truncated as well. Skaters pretty much all look the same (since they're all 1 centimeter tall on the screen anyway). Part of the allure of Tony Hawk was GREAT control and the ability to see the board. All that is gone for Game Boy Advance. Avoid this game."
3,Good game- Good graphics- View of skater (stink),"When I first played this game, I thought it was going to be the best. I had no idea on how the graphics were, but I heard that they were great. I thought the view of the game was going to be lik DreamCast or like the PS2, but when I played the view totally (stunk). I wished that the makers of the game would've made a better view. If the view for THPS 3 are'nt better then THPS 2 than I won't buy it. Thats why I gave it a three stars"
5,Tony Hawk 2 Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Oh my goodness this game rocks!! If you have the playstation vesion. It's got the most of the same levels and some for Tony Hawk one.This is the best game on GBA
4,Good,It is a really good game but it should have skater and park creator. That is the only flaw in this great game.
5,gaming to the next generation,Gameboy has never been better. Tony Hawk is challenging and it is 3D. The graphics are as good as nintendo 64. It is cool to play multiplayer and you can play it for hours.
4,Best Graphics on Game Boy Advance,"This game is worth buying. It's a little bit hard, but the game's graphics of this game is really good. It's the best handfeld 3D game ever. Trust me, it's worth buying."
2,Why does everyone think its so great?????,Sure the graphics are good you can give it that but they dont matter a ton to me. The game got me bored in less than a minute and the controls are hard to get used to. There aren't enough levels either. I like pro skater games but not this one.
3,this game is ok,"I've had my gameboy advance since it came out and this game is ok but it gets kind of boring over a while. If you dont really understand skateboarding, i suggest not to get this game. I enjoyed it alot, but I have already beaten it about five times. I hope this review has been helpful to you."
4,Very complete feeling,"I've read reviews of this game of ign.com, etc, that said that the overhead perspective was an issue and that the controls are hard to get used to, even for experienced Hawk players. My experience is that this is a very easy playing game that feels just like the console versions. I had no problem getting used to the controls and I was tearing up levels that I already knew from the console. Plus they include a ""kids"" mode you can go into where it's nearly impossible to fall. I give it four stars instead of five becasue I already have the console version so it's not a life-changing, never-ending barrel of fun (& I bet alot of people who get this game have already played it on other systems). But it does kick alot of booty! I do reccomend it!"
3,Tony2,"This game is good, but not awesome. It has replay value, but its no rpg. I personally like it better for nintendo because you get more into the game, as the rider. I skate so i know the whole physics deal, and its really very close to actual life skating, cept for the places of course. Pros - Making money to buy thing like stats and better decks. Great charcters, with different characteristics. much much replay value, i havent gotten bored yet!!(as of many months) God mode is awesome, and works very well with this game.(God mode is where you are looking over the person or persons) Cons - Easy enough to beat, and once you get it down its easy to do huge tricks. SPECIALS DONT DO MUCH!!! yes the specials dont do much if anythings, because you get tons of points for normal moves. Areas could be more complex, but its not exactly a bad thing to memorize them!Great game, Great buy!!"
4,This is a cool game!,"This games cool,but not as cool as the others(nintendo64,playstasion,ex..)Why I think that is becuse you cant create a skater,nor park.I got it for my 10th birthday and when I found that out,I didn't like it as mutch."
4,solid game on the Advance,"Hand held games are always a little scary to buy...you are never quite sure what you are going to get in such a small package. Despite what Activision threw at us with the GBC version of the Hawk series (ouch) they managed to pull it off for the Advance.Graphics--well done; the skaters look like people instead of..well, whatever...Controls--solid; they take awhile to figure out, but once you get it, its all goodPlayability--once again, well done...my only problem is with the the depth-perception in certain areas on the game. sometimes you think you are on target to land on a rail in order to grind it, when in reality you fly right by it and hit a wall.sound--this is a weak area; the sound is pretty bad and makes you adjust your hardware if you smell where i'm comin from"
5,Easily One of the Best,"This is a must have! If you need a reason to get a game boy advance, this is it. Amazing graphics, awesome gameplay and sweet sounds. Defininately get this game. It even features levels from the first Tony Hawk game. All the tricks from the Dreamcast and Playstation versions. Truly awesome!!"
2,XXXXXXX,"Tony hawk2 is a great game, but if you are good at thps, espescially thps2, this is not a game for you. Not. While its fun for a while, it gets really easy to beat. after a while (3 days) i was able to beat the game with any character in 20 minutes. however, if you dont intend to play this game all the time, maybe only on roadtrips or during a plane flight, then its great. good graphics, good sound, nice cheats, but the controls are somewhat lacking. gameplay is downright bad. dont think im some jerk, though, i loved this game at first. its just too dang easy and repetetive. get advance wars."
3,thelawlessfrontier,I have seen several vhs and dvd's of this movie there has always been ten or so minutes missing near the end of the movie if there is a complete movieI would like to see it... from the time zanti is at the poisoned well to the arrival of the heroine at the mining shack the movie is poorly patched together...
4,Good Empowerment Affirmations,"I received this gifted e-book online immediately after ordering it. I sent it to my middle daughter, who really doesn't have an interest in Empowerment Affirmations.However, I got to peruse it when my daughter came to visit in December, and I found the book very interesting and I really like the extended Empowerment Affirmations. There are affirmations for many situations.I recommend this book to anyone interested in Empowerment Affirmations. They work."
4,Hurry Up & Meditate,"Celestial Memories - my go-to cd & best buddy as I know it bestI highly recommend you try one of her cd's and see what they might offer you. Better yet, attend a concert & see what most draws you so you can select your perfect cd. Best to listen to when you have a few minutes to hurry up and meditate...ha ha...don't recommend using while power walking or driving...prefer sitting in candle lit silence and being blissed by Elivia's music...like being inside a secret sacred cathedral...Namaste"
2,Poor tone of voice,"I bought this to help me through my first ever pregnancy. However, I couldn't even finish reading it. I have used other books in the ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" series, so I thought that this would work for me. However, I felt that the author was talking down to the reader. I would not recommend it unless you like being made to feel stupid for not knowing the things discussed in this book. However, I guess it does serve as a guide to pregnancy, so I guess if you feel like the author's tone of voice wouldn't bother you, then this isn't a terrible product."
5,Great travel pillow,I had a 'u-shaped' pillow before but it didn't give me the freedom to move it around. Sometimes I use this up-and-down; other times right behind my neck....it's more flexible than a regular travel pillow. It folds away quickly and easily and I like the soft cover!
2,Difficult to use,"I bought this item as a gift for my wife. We take long flights several times a year and she is a great napper. She tried to use it and gave it back to me and took my wrap around pillow. Because it does not wrap around your neck, it is very difficult to use on a plane. About the only way it works is if you have a window seat and can lean against the side of the plane. It is well made, but I don't recommend this item."
4,This Game is Cool,"At the first part of the game you have to break into a bank and fight the bad guys off. There is a lot of action. It is cool because you have to battle the bad guys, like Rhino. My brother and I have been having a lot of fun with this game."
4,Indexer's Point of View,"I indexed this book. It's an excellent collection of long essays by different authors on different aspects of Salem, including its architectural history, maritime tradition and, of course, the witchcraft trials. In addition to being easy to read and informative, it's also a handsome edition, with full color photographs on nearly every page. Well worth adding to your history collection. I receive no profit from sales of this book, and recommend it only because it is worth reading."
5,awesome,"Love this concert. For someone who has little exposure to her work, this DVD is perfect. It contains so many of her best songs and the production value is just phenomenal. I have watched this DVD many times and each time I am msmorized by the concert. Wish I was there."
3,Kylie Showgirl,"Its a shame that Kylie Minogue isn't as well known in the United States as she is in her native Australia or even in Europe. A few viewings of her Showgirl Greatest Hits tour could change all that. Filmed before an enthusiastic audience at London's Earls Court in May 20005, Minogue shows why she is such a fan favorite throughout the rest of the world.The Showgirl Tour presents 28 of Minogue's greatest hits and is more of a spectacle than a normal concert. Featuring lavish costumes and twelve dancers the show is always fun to watch even if its diminutive star sometimes gets lost in what's happening on the giant stage. Highlights include Better the Devil You Know, Spinning Around, Over the Rainbow and Your Disco Needs You.Pull up a chair, fix yourself your favorite beverage and indulge yourself in a night of campy pop fun. See it."
1,BORING! BORING! BORING NO TALENT!,I swear this woman cannot dance nor put on a decent show. Nothing but hand gestures and movements. Anyone wants my copy can have it for free. I cannot believe I wasted money on this no talent airhead.
4,Kylie is back!,"Great gift for a Kylie Minogue fan, shows the concert in great detail for those who couldn't make it over the pond to see her in Europe!"
4,Kylie in Sydney,Quite a good recording for a live concert. Minogue's band and tour staff have done an excellent job in recording the live concert. They have captured the excitement of a live performance and Kylie at her best. Showgirl Tour London DVD has a better selection of her hits.
3,Still waiting for her to outdo her Brit Awards performance...,"While I hold Madonna as the Queen of Pop, I hold Kylie as the Princess of Pop. I've loved her from Locomotion all through I Believe but I have yet to see a concert of hers that truly moves me. The most moving live performance I have seen from her is her Brit Awards show Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head. I'd like Kylie to really dance and not just walk around the stage for one, get rid of ""dancers"" who only pose and not dance on stage as they do on this DVD, and hire a production team that can produce a show with captivating visuals and moving sound mixing(stop using neon paint and peace symbols, so overdone). I have watched this DVD several times and it fails to make me get up in my living room and dance. Kylie is talented and I'd just like to see her take it to the next level. Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Kylie fan."
4,"The Eye of Kossinli, Goddess of Mirth","A pleasant tale of a faintly Arabian-Nights world with a charming and enterprising heroine. (To say the least. She's a thief.)Layla, in what we might call a fit of Dunsanity, steals the emerald that was the eye of the goddess. Though she returns it, the goddess retaliates... in her fashion.It's nice to get away for a bit into Layla's world, and the author has left doors open for a sequel."
5,This Gem must not go undiscovered!,I loved every minute of it and could not put it down. Ann Brandt does a great job of weaving in more than one basic plotline with strong characters that are complex and believeable. I also enjoyed the description of the North Carolina scenery. Ann Brandt uses such wonderful imagery that I felt as if I was right there. She also does an excellent job of pulling together the main plot as well as the sub-plots and bringing the book to a strong finish. This book is definately on my recommended reading list!
4,What a good read!,"I bought this book to read on a long flight. It started slow, so I put it down. I picked it back up after I got home and couldn't put it down again. There are so many twists and turns! The plot just kept getting thicker! The characters were easy to identify with and I could almost see their faces. I really enjoyed this book!"
1,"Yawn, snore; what a bore!","Simply one of the worst books I have ever read -- didn't evenbother to finish it! The writing was sophomoric and simplistic, andthe story line was just too pat for me to deal with. I was far from being transported back to Florida or North Carolina (and I'm quite familiar with both those places). On the contrary, I felt this story could have taken place anywhere -- which was a let-down for me. Thank goodness I got this one out of the library and didn't waste my money!!"
4,An Engaging Read!!,"In her first novel, I found Brandt's portrayal of characters to be very deep. The character's themselves are complex. . .the story is not. Living in NC, I figured out quickly that the names of the characters from North Carolina have Carolina names (they are all counties and towns) Avery=Avery Country; Mars=Mars Hill; Wayne=Waynesville; Shelby=Shelby. The ""outsiders"" from Flordia have ""normal"" names. After meeting Brandt, I can assure you that she is just as deep as her characters. She herself had a life-changing experience. I would encourage any of you who enjoyed CROWFOOT to go meet her if possible. The discussion of the novel was just as engaging."
5,A should be made-for-tv-movie -- a three-night cliff-hanger!,"Ann Brandt's CROWFOOT RIDGE is a GOOD READ -- a FAST READ -- a full-circle ""coming-of-age"" story of a thoughtful woman's ""search-for-soul!"" Puzzle pieces are skillfully put in place by the last page -- 278.I've sent a copy to a Hollywood friend -- an A-list producer of successful ""made-for-tv"" projects. I think it could be a cliff-hanger -- very interesting to ""watch"" CROWFOOT ""wind"" before its methodical unspin -- a two or three night saga!"
5,Gorgeous and feels great in my hand!,"I've been looking for years for coffee mugs, but so far never found the right set to replace my mismatched chipped ones collected over the years.This is it! The blue color is stunningly beautiful and the mug feels wonderful in my hand. The size is as big as the largest (and most used) mugs in my cabinet."
4,Does the job...,"...and does it well. I use this for gigs that I have to set up 2 stage mics and possibly an iPod. The sound is crisp and the controls are easy.The only reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars is because of the inputs. Would love to see 2 XLRs vs 2 1/4"" inputs.Definitely recommend."
5,Fascinating Story,"""Burned"" by Jana Cone is a true crime story that will rock you to the very tip of your toes. It is obvious this story took many, many hours of detailed research. The author has a knack for presenting dry facts in such a way as to make the reader sit on the edge of his seat, turning pages, eager to discover more.Each person in this fascinating story is introduced in such a way you feel like you know them; the good, the bad and the ugly; the weak and the strong.This is not a fun type, feel good story. It is a raw slice of real life. I would not give this book a five star rating; it merits at least ten stars! Jane Cone is a master of her craft. Hope to read more from this fine author."
5,Exceeds expectations!,"I read my first true-crime book as a teenager, and it was a hard act to follow--Helter Skelter. I can honestly say that Burned lived up to all my lofty expectations. Jana Cone gives her readers just the right blend of a finely detailed factual account of the crime, investigation, and trial, combined with an intimate look at the lives and histories of all the key players in the case. And since Ms. Cone is from Georgia herself, I didn't have to suffer through the stereotypical caricatures Southerners so often become in the hands of journalists not lucky enough to be born south of the Mason-Dixon line. My only complaint is that I didn't like the ending, but since this is a true story, that's not the author's fault. Jana Cone is definitely one of those authors whose next books I will eagerly await and buy as soon as they're available."
4,Can't figure out why he's the last detective,Can't help but love this guy. I've gotten several people hooked on this series. He's a lovable detective who always gets a bad rap.
5,Season Three Even Better,"If you enjoy seeing characters evolve in a series, this British mystery series is sure to delight. In the first season, Dangerous the detective only got the good cases by default. He came across as a bit of a ""loser""--department colleagues laughed at him, boss demoted him, wife divorced him, even his dog led him about on the leash.But through sheer persistence and solid detective work, Dangerous is now respected and the star of the department. The cases are more interesting, he is competent and confident, so even the ex-wife is coming around. Personally, I think he could do better than her, but you can't deny her pouty appeal. We'll see if he succumbs.This is now a seriously solid series. Even the plots are getting better. The boozy boss ""guv"" is growing on you, Mod his best friend and roommate is slightly less irritating and sparks some of Dangerous's best comic lines, and Dangerous is getting dangerously attractive."
1,Worst review manual ever!,"This has got to be the worst review manual ever. The solved problems are difficult to follow because there is little to no detail. If you need to review IE topics, you're better off just getting the practice tests from NCEES."
2,I didn't like it.,This game has pretty good graphics but the gameplay sucks. It is so hard to aim because you have to use the D-pad and the joystick at the same time in order to aim while moving. They should of made it like Golden Eye (james bond) where you move with the joystick and you hold down a trigger to aim. The missions are just going around shooting people then collecting a coin after you kill them. And the arenas are tiny. If you like little Deathmatch games with the most annoying aimer I would suggest it. But if you have a nintendo stick to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.
2,oh please...,Ok when i first saw this game i thought it would be pretty cool...but it's not (at least in my opinion). To start with the good stuff the graphics r pretty good and the weapons are animated nicely. thats just bout it. The single player missions arent even real missions its like a huge boot-camp. all you have to do is shoot peeps and collect stupid coins. so basically the whole game is intended for multiplayer. but since the multiplayer has only two diffrent scenarios (compare to Perfect dark which has like 15). So even if you play 2 player it gets boring pretty fast. the controls are the weirdest i have ever seen in a game but luckily you can change them to a semi-okay setting. Personally i think that if your not going to go online you shouldn't buy this game. It just doesnt have enough stuff that you can do in single player (i beat all single player missions on every difficulty in one afternoon).
5,Comprehensive and Unified volume,"This is THE first systematic volume on light scattering by nonspherical particles and their practical applications. The historical foreword by van de Hulst, a legend in this area, was appreciated.Its is up-to-date and very practical -- especially like the applications to geophysics, remote sensing, and planetary and space physics."
2,Behind the times,This system has spec way too low for today's software. Why buy something you will have to replace next year? Step up to something with more memory and a faster cpu (for example you need 128MB *just* to load office!). You will be sorry if you order this system.
4,A heart to ear dialogue,"The works:This CD includes Shostakovitch string quaterts 1, 2 and 4. Apart from the first quartet, which is whimzzical (still interesting), those quartets already show a great composer at work.The interpretation:The Mandelring quartet does a fabulous job. Their play is both restrained (in that they do not add inexistant tension when it is not required) and unbridled (when Shostakovitch wanted it so). The result is a very intimate contact with the composer's heart and mind through his interprets.The audio:This SACD is a jewel in terms of advanced resolution. Natural dynamics and proper tones allow the listener to hear the genuine intention of the composer and really feel connected. A show piece for the technology and a real gem for the audience."
2,Super Smash Bros Brawl,I was totally disappointed with this game. Characters are too small and you can't keep track of where you are in the game. I will never play the game again. Wasted money.
3,OK but not great,"I was excited to get this game. I had heard everyone talk about it for months. Picked it up and can I say disappointed!!! It's mostly hitting buttons and tilting the joystick as fast as you can. Whoever does it faster wins. Not much skill involved. It was fun for about 15 minutes and then boring! I can understand why people would like it, but if you really like games and want a challenge that requires some skill, skip this one. Pick up Mario Galaxy or Zelda instead! Trust me, it's not horrible, but just not that great either."
1,I Don't Like This Game AT ALL!,"About myself, I've never been a Nintendo owner until the Wii. So I've never played any previous versions of this. It seems to me that this game is only fun for people who grew up playing other versions of this. There was so much Buzz about this game when it was coming out, I wanted to get it, which I regret. For me, it got boring really fast. It just seems like more of the same over and over again. I'd rather play Wii Sports Boxing, or even Punch-Out. My young son doesn't seem to like it much, either. He'll turn this game off in 10 minutes, where normally we have to force him to stop playing video games. Rent this one before deciding to buy."
1,"Boring and multiplayer game is so small, you can't even see yourself!","I bought this game because of all the high ratings and reviews I saw. I was very very disappointed. If you are buying this game so that you can enjoy multiplayer games, FORGET IT! You can't even see your character on the screen and you pretty much just press any buttons you want and just jump around.There is no point to this game and it is boring."
4,AwEsOmE,"I would like to start off... THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A GAME FOR ADULTS!! O.eMy dad tried to play it, and so did my mom. They BOTH got frustrated because they didn't get the whole concept of beating other players up!They wanted my sister and I to wait while they tried to pick something up! SORRY! But this isn't that kind of game. I'll have my friend's over and they loooove to be able to pick diffrent characters and stages.I also like the WIFI, because if no one wants to play me, I can just go online and fight other people. :P"
5,Super Review for Super Smash Bros. Brawl,This game is a good game. Graphics are better than the previous Super Smash Bros. More characters and unique characters. Difficulty various because you can choose your difficulty level. You can use the Gamecube controller with it.
4,Fun for me and for my seven-year-old,"Yeah, I'm one of those moms who plugs her kid into a game console from time to time, but I feel ambivalent about it, so I try to monitor the content and, as often as possible, play with my son so that we're together and more than just the slackjawed, button-pushing part of his brain gets activated. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is easy enough to play and gets better as the player gets better. That makes it a game that my son enjoys a lot. He can play it without direction from an adult. And it's fun for me to play, too.The graphics are beautiful. The sound is great. But I don't think this is quite as much better than the Gamecube Melee as I had hoped it would be. Like others, I was hoping for better integration of the wii remote's capabilities. The reversion to thumb gymnastics at the finger olympics is a disappointment after Mario Party 8 got my aging rear end off the couch to bat at balls and shake soda cans."
4,Melee vs Brawl,"Compared to Melee, Brawl has...1. nearly the same game play with a few new characters, levels, and features2. some new fun things to do in single-player: longer adventure mode, more prizes to win (and it gives metered hints on how to get those prizes which is fantastic)3. 16:9 aspect ratio available4. online play, but too slow for serious competitionBTW, if you are a Melee fan, plan to use the GC controllers for any serious play."
3,"Fun but not ""wii""","The game is fun, the stage, the action, the characters are all fun. However, it is not a true ""wii"" game. The game doesn't use any motion catching tech, which means you are definitely playing a conventional game with the old-styly control mode. Even worse, you can not use your controller to move the arrow on the screen!It's a fabulous game, while it is not a true ""wii"" game."
3,"SSBB Review, Interesting but a little bit lack of order","This is a fun game but I simply don't give it a 5 stars review because during play I kind of lose the order in the fight I end up pushing buttons randomly and hitting everything but my enemies. I think I need more practice though but I prefer games like Tekken or Mortal Kombat. The other Thing is that it didn't keep my attention for a very long period of time, I play with it just occasionally"
5,Super Fun! Super Smash Bros. Brawl,We've been waiting so long for this game! My boys and husband love this. It's challenging and yet easy enough for beginners to play. Incredible effects and improvements from GameCube Smash Bros. Multiple players highly recommended.
5,Great Game!,This game is fun whether you're playing solo or with friends. Can't get the online to work yet but I think it might just be me. Definitely worth the $. A must have for your Wii collection!
5,This game was the turning point,"My 9 year-old has surpassed me in video game ability. I cannot beat her in this game. She toys with me and then opens up a can and destroys me, forcing me in turn to eviscerate my 7 year-old in the game. But she'll cry, so then I have to let her beat me by patiently standing there while she methodically pummels me while my wife nods in approval. So I finish 3rd and wish they would play me in Tecmo Bowl or NHL 94. Haven't tried playing on-line yet but I'm sure that's good too."
4,Dual Layer Disc Issues,"When I first got SSBB, I popped it into my Wii and got a disc read error. Disc was in great shape and after some searching online, apparently this is an issue with a ""small percentage of Wiis"" (quote from Nintendo's website). I had to set up a repair order with Nintendo to have them clean my Wiis DVD lens and they also request that you send your copy of the game with your Wii. The process was relatively painless and they were very quick about it, but I was without my Wii for a few days.With that said, great game. Smash Bros. for the Wii was my first exposure and the game has been a blast. I would definitely recommend it to any Wii owner. I would suggest it even more strongly to anyone who has had any disc read errors with their Wii in the past, as buying this game will get you a free ticket to have Nintendo clean your DVD drive lens."
4,Great Multi-Player Game,"This game is a great party / multi-player game. The controls are very intuitive and you can adjust the balance to level the playing field between skilled players and button mashers.If you have played a Smash Bros before, this one will feel very familiar.The single-player campaign is much improved over previous Smash Bros games, but its not worth buying just for single player."
4,"Nintendo, you've done it again.","This game was perfectly fine. I wish the online was better, but it was their first try. The stages were fine, but some were a little too big .Now let me tell you one recurring thing for reviews that are one star. They just have no skill, and can't get used to an actual good game.Be ready for the online, it might lag.PRACTICE. MOST BAD REVIEWS ARE DUE TO NO SKILL.DONT PLAY STORY MODE OFTEN. IT SUCKS. ONLY USE IT TO UNLOCK CHARACTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.PLAY MULTIPLAYER. IT IS THE ONLY WORTH IT THING ON THIS GAME. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACTUAL FRIENDS.I rest my case. Good game, worth the money."
3,Good for Rainy Days,"The new characters, awesome as they might be, are overpowered. Brawl is nothing but raw power and no medium. Where as Melee had a nice balance to it. In Melee each character had his or her own unique ability and strength level. Brawl's newer characters all overpower the veterans. Some balance and original music would have made this game a lot better. Instead of searching through CD's for your song, I liked how Melee had the option of just holding down the ""R"" button changed the score.Hey, if you like it fine. I'm just giving my opinion."
2,Price check,"I got this cheaper at Wal-Mart. The price was pretty cheap, and I know exactly why. Not even my friend was satisfied because the controls were to hard to understand, plus he got too mad whenever he lost to the CPU (not that surprising, actually). The gameplay and characters are probably the only good things about this game. If anyone disagrees with me, that's fine by me."
4,wii games,"Delivery time as promissed ( I had super saver option, so it was not very fast) game new in excellent condition. Bought it for my son, so I can not rate it except being OK for his age."
3,"good game, but it's starting to show its age.","Visually speaking it's not as polished as most Wii games being released now. And the game does not make use of any wii-mote motion-sensing capabilities. You might as well just use the classic controller. There's no reason this game is on the Wii instead of gameCube.That said, this game can be a lot of fun for big groups of people. Four can play at a time; but the game lends itself well to having other people watch as they wait for their turn."
3,Hours of fun,"This game is great, it reminded me of childhood when my brother and I would be playing games like this.The controls are a little funky with the wii remote, takes some getting used to. Online play is a blast, I just wish more people still played it, sometimes I can sit for hours and never find any opponents."
4,Very Pleased :),"Very Pleased with our purchase, my son loves it! Was in excellent condition and we received it in a timely manner."
3,Gets boring fast,"I got this game the day it came out and got addicted to it for about two days until I beat the story mode. It took me about two days to unlock every character and every stage. The other extras(trophies,stickers,music) aren't even worth playing ssbb so much.I give it a three because it's fun for a few matches, but then it gets really boring."
5,Great for Small Groups,"After I got Super Smash Brothers for the N64 (and beat it of course) I found myself waiting for this game to come out for years. I preordered it, of course, got it, invited a couple friends over, and we were up all night. This game keeps everyone involved and at the edge of their seats. There is infinite replayability so it is very hard to get bored. There are also many new characters and items than the first 2 (I was very surprised to see pokemon trainer as an option). The gameplay is much like the other two games with the beat-em-up style that gives these games their edge yet without the gore that other games implement. It is good, clean fun!"
5,super game!!!,Lots of fun.. you can be multiple characters and more keep opening up. Lots of game play and loads of fun with friends.
5,A Must-Buy Game,"Super Smash Bros Brawl is an exhilaratingly awesome game which includes Nintendo characters like Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Diddy Kong! The 3D graphics are insane. The thing I like most is the rumble effects so it makes the brawl or melee that you are in more lively. The Subspace Emissary is a great sector of the game with amazing clips that will leave you stunned. Nintendo and Sega Collided forces with the addition of Sonic the Hedgehog. My minor complaints are that Nintendo left out some great characters like Waluigi and Mega Man. Mega Man would make the game way more amazing. Favorite Characters: R.O.B. , Mr. Game and Watch, (and if added) Mega Man.It's Must buy game for all of the ""live free, die hard"" gamers!"
5,"Great Game, The kids love it!",The kids have been playing this game every day. It keeps their attention and doesn't get old. I highly recommend it.
5,Great game,Great fighter game. Just kinda wished they ruled out pokemon. I liked pokemon like hmmm 7-10 years ago. I thought it died lol. Guess some people out there still like it.
5,Awesome,This is the best fighting game. It has a big roster of big named characters. The stages are nice and the new finishing moves are great.
5,SSBB RULES!!!!!,"I got this game for my birthday and it rules. The graphics are amazing and I love the music. The adventure mode might take you a while to beat, but it's worth it. If you are thinking of buying this game, you should totally buy it."
4,Game,The product is great at a less expensive rate than in the stores. My son is enjoying his Wii and that is what matters.
5,Great,My son says this is a fun game. I like this game because it keeps him out of my hair when I'm trying to do other things
5,best game,this is one of the best games ive ever played. i would give this as an example of one of the best nintendo games ever
3,Another Wii Game That Isn't Really Designed for the Wii,"When I bought Super Smash Bros., I was expecting the whole family to be able to spend hours having lots of wholesome fun punching each other out through the magic of Wii. It was very disappointing to realize that this game is nothing more than an updated version of a classic arcade-style video game that uses the Wii controllers as normal video game controllers instead of taking advantage of the Wii's unique motion sensing features.So, instead of burning calories by brawling with each other (digitally, of course), everyone just sits on the couch and lets their thumbs do the punching.If you want to chill out on the couch and play a fast-paced arcade-style game with loads of fun characters, Super Smash Bros. is just the thing. However, if you want to use your Wii to play a great game that will help you to burn off some aggression (and calories), try Punch Out!! for Wii instead of Super Smash Bros."
3,Plenty of fun...,"Fine game. Certainly more fun with multiple players. Doesn't have the intense string of button/direction combos to pull of a move like Street Fighter, etc. - which as I've gotten older I appreciate (my memory is now full with things like did I pay the mortgage this month instead of the combo needed to pull off a Tiger Punch)."
2,Don't understand what all the hype is about.,"Super Smash Bros. Brawl.......This game was fun at first. Quickly lost interest in it. I had this game for less than a week and traded it in.+Playing on-line was great. It didn't not take long to connect to a battle. There graphics were OK, nothing spectacular. Decent amount of characters to choose and unlock. These were the only 3 highlights of the game, for me anyways.+One player story mode gets old very quick. Like I said, I lost interest in this game after only 2 days.+The characters on the screen are way too small. It is easy to lose sight of your character. Specially during a 3 or 4 player match. Even when the match is only 2 players the characters are tiny. There is no zoom option.+The speed of this game is sluggish. Could have been much faster.Thought this game was going to be fun. I thought wrong."
1,Just a bunch of button mashing.,"I don't understand the popularity of this game. It must be nostalgia for previous versions or something. The whole game just consists of a bunch of button mashing. No skill, no strategy nothing. Just hit whatever button as much as you can, that's it."
1,super smash brawl,"Isn't going to win any awards any time soon. this concept of arcade has been done so many times it's gotten very old. It's graphics are poor, it's excitement level last for all of about 30 minutes. save your money. however, mario Galaxy was great get that one instead"
1,Worst fighting game,I love fighting games and this one is really bad. The only saving grace was that you could play so many cool characters. This game was so poorly done that I sold it back to EB before everyone else was trying to sell it too. Find it used on craig's list if you must have the game.
1,I just want to know,I just want to know when I will return my money and send the game 2 weeks agothe game is not served
2,Most overrated videogame in the history of videogames.,Dont get me wrong the game is silly fun with some friends over but all these perfect scores are a riot. After playing for a few hours I was wondering if I was playing the same game everyone else is but then again if I was judging this on whats available on the Wii I guess this is as good as it gets. I guess I just dont get it.
3,Did not live up to the hype,"My husband and I purchased this game after reading some reviews online and watching some videos of game play. We only played it a handful of times and then sold it. The controls are not too hard to get used to, and playing with the different characters was fun. While it was kind of fun, it was not the kind of game we could play over and over."
5,Bravo Brawl!,My 11 yr. old loves this game. Unlocking Sonic was a little frustrating but worth it in the end!
3,Fun but awkward gaming,"The concept and the characters are there, but the controls are awful. Highly suggest using a game cube controller for this game to make any sense at all. Even then, the moves are not very sophisticated, and you still risk getting your butt kicked by someone who's just mashing on buttons. B-"
4,Fun... But nothing really new.,"Don't get me wrong. This is an awesome game. My only gripe with it, though, is that IT'S THE SAME THING. Apart from some new characters and a few new items, it's the same game as Melee.Pros:Crisp graphicsFun gameplaySnake?!?Cons:Same gameplay"
4,A lot of multiplayer fun,"Super Smash Bros. BrawlThis game is a lot of fun~~ it get in perfect state and very fast :3 . But the game is great when you're having a videogame party and want to kick some arss~~ but sometimes, in solitarie, you get a little saturade. Anyway, it's a big step in the Smash evolution. I'm happy with it and I will buy the next one too <3"
3,OK if you've got time,"The Super Smash Bro Brawl seems like a great game when you know what you are doing. I have had this for a while but due to lack of time I haven't mastered it yet. There are so many things that you need to learn in order to play this game, especially since there are many characters involved. I recently had a Wii Party with friends and we played this game. I can tell you that I was ""killed"" all the time; one of my friends has played this before - maybe on Nintendo DS. But overall I noticed that everyone else was just punching buttons on the remote hoping for sonething to happen. So I say the game is great if you have time to figure out how it works.With that in mind, maybe it's not the game for kids because typically kids like a game that is ready to play out of the box without having to read manuals."
5,"The BEST, LONG LASTING fun Wii game for my child!","Marrrrrrio, Kirby, Shadow, Sonic...They're all there, and ready to share their magic!My 6 year old, Nintendo lover, is still mesmerized by this game after 5 months...It has become that ""special"" one, the one you never quite tire of!The big favorite of playdates at our house, SUPER SMASH BRAWL is playable by anyone.Even me, mom.The lightest move on your part, and you look like you know what your doing! :)Your child will love to team up with you against other warriors, or battle against you, one-on-one...Be ready for some fun!"
5,Simple Fun,"Super Smash Bros Brawl is a simple concept that is well developed. Unique characters and abilities, great menue interface and audio, lots of multiplayer options. Fun for all ages.A+"
5,Smash and bash,"What can i say about brawl, fun for all ages. I can play with my older brother even though he find most of the wii games we own boring. But i dont. I wojnt spoil any characters but there are some good ones. And many have jumped from melee to brawl. There is a story like mode again not spoiling it. There clasic mode. level creator and many more. And now there is a smash ball where you break it and get a powerful move most have different ones but some have the same one. This a game for all the ages. Parents no blood but lots of fighting. Hope this review helped."
5,Don't Be Fooled By Teen Rating,This is a really fun game.This game has in no instance a teen rating. If you are wondering about the violence there is no blood or anything like that. Just normal cartoon violence. It is very fun to play with friends and the story mode keeps you entertained for a while. This is a must have game and with it's Teen rating I would have personally given this E10+. Overall rating: 9/10.
5,awesome game!,"I love this game! all the modes are challenging but fun! i can see how this game was considered the ""best fighting game of the year"""
5,brawl review #160,"playing solo is fun but even fighting CPUs isn't as good as playing against another person. there are a verity of single player modes such as Boss Battle, Home run contest, classic, smash the targets, Subspace emissary (also multie player), and u can even fight CPUs in standard brawl or u can customize the experience like in Mele but its better now because for example u can turn on mettle low gravity Bunnie hood brawl instead of for instance low grav mele."
3,Decent Game,"I like this game, but I can't play it on a regular basis. It is better than the other smash brothers, but it's still a difficult game to get a hang of and really know what you're doing. I like the characters and scenes, but the controls are a bit confusing."
5,very addictive game!!!,"I got this game for Christmas--it is one of the most fun games I have played for the Wii. I definitely recommend this game. It is very versatile as you can do many things, not just fighting (2d-platform game, other smaller games). Very fun. If you have a Wii, get it."
2,Simply Overrated,"Don't get me wrong Smash Bros fans, this game is fun while playing against other people, and addictive. However, I do feel the game does get old after awhile like all Fighting games. The game can also be annoying at times while your characters become small to compensate for something going on in the background. And god help you during some of the stages when there is so much chaos going on you lose track of your character let alone what the heck is going on. Maybe that's the whole point or maybe I'm just getting old."
2,This game has issues,"Super Smash Bros has always been an amazing game for the Nintendo fan, but this version of the game ""Brawl"" has some serious issues. I believe that many Wii owners will experience Disc Read Error issues with the game, because it is one of the only Dual Layer disced game Nintendo has released. Nintendo says that it's a dvd lens cleaning issue, but it's beleived that's it's more then that. It's been suggested that if/when you send in your Nintendo Wii to be ""cleaned"", they're actually replacing the lens with a new one. If this was the case, I wish Nintendo would just be straight with the consumer, which I'm sure we would all very much appreciate."
1,Didn't work,We live overseas. I purchased this in August for Christmas for my son and it doesn't work. Bummer!! I won't order again.
2,el peor de los 3 smash,"este es sin duda el peor de los 3 smash bros que han salido,inclusive es igualito al super smash bros melee osea no mejoraron en nada,mejor me quedo con smash bros de nintendo 64 que si es un juego de primera."
3,Really good but i would have liked to have seen more,"I started this series of games in Melee. This game features the same principalsI really like the story mode. It is a neat way to link all the characters together. I really liked how all the characters team up in the end to beat the inal boss. I wish the game could have been a bit more challanging though. Story mode is almost entirly linear until the last levelI like the idea of a level creater feature, though this game was lacking. Only so many tiles could be plased, only three background were avaliable. The end product was a random background with mix matched blocks everywhere.I like the veriety of characters, the trophy game, and challange mods.I did not understand the random demos of other past nintendo games. You could only play for 5 mins, a waste of time!"
4,GREAT with friends! Alone....meh,"I cant even TELL you much fun I had in high school playing online or at my friends house with this game. The spikes! the sudden deaths! SO MUCH FUN AND LAUGHTER! This game I will ALWAYS remember my high school years (even though I JUST got into college last month lol) but all in all this is a great smash bros game. I only didn't like playing by myself. I didn't feel it alone. I have all 3 and even though Melee is my favorite, Brawl has a special place in my heart. ^_^ Hope the next one is even better Nintendo!"
4,Smash Bros Brawls Rocks,"We bought this game for your 6 year old for his birthday. He and his older brother love to play. The only downside is that they try to ""brawl"" when the Wii isn't on :)"
5,SUPER!!!!!!,"This is a great game!I think the best mode is multiplayer.advenure mode is good to.Lots of good characters to play as.graphics are much better then MELEE.My favorite character is Lucas. Heres a list of pros and cons. pros characters, graphics, trophies,smash balls.cons poke balls and assist trophies dont really change alot. over all a great game!"
4,A lot of button mashing,"Super Smash Bros is another in a long line of Nintendo crossover titles. It includes both heroes and villains from many of its other very popular titles. It continues the very long tradition of beautiful art, graphics and music in a fun and exciting combat game.This game has a built in story which is rare for a ""streetfighter"" type side by side combat game, which I view as a major plus. Sometimes the story sequences can be long and painfully drawn out, but they are easily skipped if necessary.I have three children and all love the game. My only complaint is that some of the button combinations for special moves can be long and almost impossible for the over 35 set."
3,Not my style... maybe for you?,"I'm not big into fighting/versus type games. This is right up that alley. I was expecting something with a bit more depth, but it's very basic. It was fun to play as all the different characters, but that was about the extent of the enjoyment for me. I plan to sell my copy."
1,Waste of time and money,"I got my son this game for his birthday. What a terrible decision! Parents beware, because in some Wii consoles this game WILL NOT run. ALL the other discs (Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart, gamecube games) run with no problem.According to Nintendo's web page ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl utilizes a double-layer disc which has a large memory capacity. A very small percentage of Wii consoles may have trouble consistently reading data off this large capacity disc if there is some contamination on the lens of the disc drive. Nintendo has specialized cleaning equipment that can resolve this problem. (Please do NOT attempt to clean the lens yourself, as you may damage the system.)"" What a lame excuse! Why didn't they say that in the first place? You buy a new game, and have to send back your console at no cost? Having myself an autistic child that is NOT an option. I want my money back, an Mario party 8 or something else.Do not believe it? Visit [..]"
1,Wii game??? Please...,"Well... actually I never played a version of this game before... I've never been a Nintendo guy... But then, I bought the wii to give it a chance. Since I'm not a gamer, I like the wii style, what disappointing was when I realized Super Smash Brawl don't even use the pointer option to select between games.So first of all, this is NOT a wii game... I think works better with a classic control, so... why is it Brawl Wii??? Then, game play is boring and you can't keep a good control of characters... Just push random bottoms and see what happens...Summarizing... the worst experience since I bough the console"
2,Overrated and overhyped.,"It's essentially more of the same we've come to expect from Melee. Brawl features more characters, more stages, and new modes, but the core gameplay hasn't evolved in the least bit.The new 1P highlight is an adventure mode called ""Subspace Emissary,"" which is essentially Melee's adventure mode extended by a factor of 20 with more of the same gameplay. Except Melee's Adventure Mode was never fun to begin with, and making it this long results in an even bigger chore. It's a sidescroller with monsters here and there, and there is a boss battle once every few stages. As a 2D platformer it's not great.The Wi-Fi can lag quite a bit and the Friend Code system is still as awful as ever."
1,Absurdly Ridiculous,"This game is so bad. It's basically a 2-D walkthrough you play by repeatedly pressing A. I bought it thinking it was going to be as good as Super Mario Galaxy, but it's ridiculous. It's for seven year old boys. The game play is monotonous and confusing. Many of the actions and moves are counter-intuitive. What a huge disappointment. Everything moves too quickly to feel as if you have any real control over the game. It feels like you are playing on autopilot. Especially peeving is the constant onslaught of video interludes, which are supposed to trick you into thinking you are playing something actually engaging or exciting, but really just substitute for a real story or real challenges. It feels like some ridiculous arcade game from 1987. Skip this one, don't believe the hype. This game is among the worst Wii has ever produced. I would never purchase this for a child. Boring. Lame."
1,Nothing Special,"I bought this game the day it came out. I heard plenty of buzz, looked at the box and it looked good. I get home and put it in to play. My first reaction was THAT'S IT?? It's a regular fighting game. I thought, oh maybe there are other types of gameplay, the box said there is a story-type mode. NOPE. It's the same except the story mode seems to just connect the fight scene over and over again.There is nothing special about this game. First of all, it does not use the motion sentative nature of the Wii controllers. Moreover, the controllers are useless. You randomly hit all your buttons and move your fighter in all directions hoping that somehow you win. And unless maybe you're playing against your friends, it is the same thing over and over again.They had all the hype, a great franchise, a innovative console but delivered a standard (at best) game.I sold my copy on Amazon the day after I bought it."
2,very desapointed,"I think I was fooled, is not really what I expected, and video advertising makes you understand that the game is played differently."
1,Bleh!!!,This is just a review about the game. IT SUCKS!!! The controls are horrible and the way the game plays sucks. I like the old one
2,Two words.....over-rated,"With all of the hype surrounding the Smash Bros. series I had high expectations when I purchased this game. Unfortunately it did not live up to those expectations. The game was enjoyable for the first couple of days, but I quickly grew tired of it. There just isn't enough depth in this game for me to keep playing it. If you don't have any nostalgic ties to this series you may want to stay away."
2,Best Controller + Best Title = Disaster?,How did this happen? If you don't have a a Gamecube controller - dont bother. This discovery ruined what should have been a fun Saturday night.
3,yuuup,"im not reviewing the game but the condition it had no booklet and it was really used but for the game its awesome if u have a wii have to have this game, great group/ party game by the way"
4,Grandson's birthday gift,This game was bought for my grandson's 13th birthday. He says he loves it and it is so much fun. Many of his friends have this game so he was happy to get his own copy.
2,Not that great,"I heard nothing but rave reviews about this game. Before you take my negative review seriously, you should consider that I played the game twice and never against anyone else. I think playing against someone may have been more fun. However, playing the storyline by myself was just boring. It wasn't really a fighting game, and wasn't really an action game, just a crazy mixture of the two. I found myself trying to use the special moves I learned from reading the book and strategy guide not to be that useful. I got better results by just mindlessly punching and kicking, which takes a lot of the fun out of the game. Luckily, I sold this one to a friend and his kids love it. Overall, I was disappointed, but I may just be too picky."
5,I LOVE THIS GAME,"I THINK THAT MARIO SUPER SMASH BROS. BRAWL WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE. WHEN I FIRST RENTED IT, I WAS HORRIBLE. I LEARNED, AND THEN IT CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. I LOVED THE CD FEATURE, AND THE CHALLENGE LIST. I LIKED THE ITEMS IN THE BRAWLS, AND I ADORED THE LEVELS. I ALSO LIKED THE CO-OP SETTING."
3,My son loves it!,My son was asking for this game long time. He absolutely loves it. Lots of characters to choose from. Endless battles in different locations. But don't expect nothing else from it. Smash each other and start the battle all over again.
2,A huge disappointment.,"For people looking for some fun to kill a month or two, this is the game. But if you have been a fan of the series since the late 1990s, you're bound to regret the purchase.Short and sweet, it is an overrated, overly-hyped title. It reworked many of the great elements of the previous two games, and deleted a lot more. To compensate, it dresses itself in hours of unlockable content (most of which is not worth the time and energy), a horrible 1-P adventure mode, and a highly uninspired fighting roster (not to mention some characters were made stronger than others, such the director's own creations!).A terrible, terrible disappointment. The only highlights are some of the fighters being interesting, and probably the best music and textures you'll see on the Wii.Outside of that, if you are more a fan of gameplay over pretty colors, this is NOT your title."
5,Great game...,This game really is very awesome. I have yet to play online against someone. The servers that host this game as bogged down big time. This is my only complaint. Hurry and fix this issue Nintendo!
4,Can't say but my hubbie likes it a lot,"So, I'm not a gamer in amy sense and my husband hasn't had a Nintendo system since the late 80's early 90's (poor guy) but I got him a Wii and this game for his b-day and he loves the nostalgia of this game. He's downright giddy when playing."
3,Average,"This game is fun, but all nintendo is doing is recreating it's older games and putting it on new systems and adding a few things. It's not working though. This game doesn't compare with any of its predecesors. One thing I hated is that A lot of times in this game, you can't see what is going on. Theres just a blaze of explosions and nonsense. Another thing I hate is is that they are putting extremely lame charaters in these games. They are starting to add a bunch of pokemon and putting people from zelda and stuff, that I really wasn't impressed with. Also the unlockable characters have a huge advantage in this game. Some of them have extremely good abilities that don't make sense. Once again nintendo is making a bunch of remakes, and they aren't improving anything in my opinion."
3,eh.. i didnt expect that.,Well there is NO wii motion controls on this game. you just use the buttons. which i thought was lame. but overall it was pretty fun i guess i get bored easy though.
3,Hyped,"I think we were expecting too much from this game from what everyone suggested and reviewed it as. It's one of those games where you don't need skills to play, just press buttons."
5,Overshoots the 1st 2 SSB's in every way possible,"It is like melee and SSB1, but this time has better graphics, about a dozen new characters, about 2 dozen new stages, a REALLY long and entertaining adventure mode, and, perhaps the best of all, the custom stage builder!!!Anyone who gives this game a 4 star or lower will never give ANY other game a 5; very few games can compete with a game of this level."
5,"Super Smash Brothers, Brawl","There was a special on this and I bought 3 for my friend, Great Nephew and of course for Me!!We all love playing this gave - we have compete with each other every time we get together."
5,Tama Talk,"When I first heard about these, In December, i knew i had to get one. I patiently waited until February 20,2006 to buy one. Once i got it, i couldn't put it down. I take it with me everywhere. Even to school, though im not allowed to. I am in 6th grade, and if everybody i know in 6th grade has one, it has to be cool!"
3,Creative but ugly,"I think that who ever created this toy was probably very creative. I like the idea very much, but I think that the doll needs a new makeover!"
5,The best toy ever,I had a v3 for a couple of days and it ran out of battery but it wasnt a huge problem because yesterday we got a new battery plus i was so ecited when i got my first v3 that my dad was upset an he ordered me this one so that I would have one today and it came yesterday also these are so awsome. I wanted one 4 so long and now I have 3. I HAVE SO MUCH FUN WITH THESE AND CANT PUT THEM DOWN. IF U DONT HAVE ONE BUY ONE
5,Awsome,Tamagotchi v3 is totally awsome. It teaches kids to take care of living things and to respect them. I love my little Star!
5,AWESOME TOY,"Tamogotchi v3 is a very fun toy and I think that kids of any age below 12 would love it. It has more stuff than any other Tamogotchi before it. Overall I will give this great toy a 4 and a half because it isn't a very educational toy, but it is very fun!"
5,why cant this amazing item be easier to get.,"my daughter wants one of these tamagotchis really bad. iv been trying for so long to get one for her. she said they are fun to play with, but the stores are really slacking with getting these out. im sure im not the only parent who is ripping out their own hair trying to get thier hands on one of these. if you get one, take good care of it and hold on to it tight!!"
5,Once again...,"I got this tamagotchi in the mail today after many days of waiting and looking online at the tracking locations from KY to New Jersey. Once I got home from school and I saw a brown UPS box I was the happiest 15 year old! I love this toy sooo much, the babies are sooo cute and adorable!!! I also love this cute color. Bandai I sure hope you're working on version 4!!!"
5,One of the best books I have ever listened too.,A terrific book. I could not stop listening. It is a great story and the fact that it is a true story makes it even better. It is a fascinating story of world war II espionage. This woman is a true hero and her story should be given more attention. I would reccomend this to anyone.
3,"Great Performance, but ...","What did they do when they digitized this great old recording?? My old LPs from about 1972 sound better than the MP3 version I just downloaded. Huh? The LPs are immediate sounding and brilliant, while the MP3 sounds kind of distant, with a peculiar low level noise that sounds for all the world like the low level noise on an LP. Very odd.But this is a great performance of Macbeth. How can you go wrong for $4? : - )"
5,A must for those interested in the first North American school of dodecaphony,"The title of this review says it all. Barbara Pentland, like Elisabeth Lutyens in England, has been unjustly neglected (a) as a woman composer and (b) as a composer who made use (at least part of the time) of her own version of serialism. In Pentland's case one might add (c) as a Canadian composer. This is a good sampling, and leaves one eager to hear more of her work."
3,Lots of action,"Well this is an older book but if you come across it get it and read it. The story is about a young women who is running from her foster home after she was attacked. She comes across Morgan and his partner riding down the Colorado and stowsaway on board one of thier boats. What follows is a fun, exciting trip down the river where they come across Indians, a Mormon settlement, and finally Trish's long lost father.I enjoyed this book and I hope you will too. Its an easy read and made for an enjoyable afternoon."
5,Great insight!,Really enjoyed reading this book. I love how Gregg presents prayer and the benefits. Gregg shows how the power of prayer is lost in today's society.
4,Enjoy this little book,"A lovely explaination of the ""lost mode of prayer"" covered extensively in ""The Isiah Effect"". I would suggest reading this book first as it is much more easily understandable."
5,Secrets of the Lost Mode of Prayer,"Great book and one of his easier to read. I will reread this several times and have put markers in for fast review. I think everyone should read this, makes perfect sense to me. We have complicated our world and maybe we should go back and study the 'ancient ones' to bring us back to reality and simplicity."
3,Just okay,"This book was a quick read, no great revelations, but a bluntly-worded reminder of some key truths as also told by others. It's always good to be reminded."
1,"Good book on the power of prayer, but...","This book give some good information on how to pray but it lacks in more than one way. he confuses the difference between intention and emotion which i had to re read at least three times to get the meaning. Second he turns to science and explains the results from various experiments, combines that with theories that are completely untested and in some cases completely out-there to try to explain the power of prayer. If it were just a scientific physical phenomena than miracles from the prayers should in most cases occur immediatly such as those that have to do with influencing another to improve.If you have read my other reviews than you know I know the power of prayer. I suggest people read about near death experiences, real life accounts of possessions, and give religion a honest go before deciding what you think the world is about."
4,Greater Health God's Way,"It's a good Christian resource book, is well written and very helpful in it's content and in its scripture references."
5,Has been a big hit with our Sunday School class,I am leading a Sunday School class on the topic of healthy living and this book has been a big hit as a study guide.
4,"Wow, a novel concept!","I was so pleased to finally find a book written by someone who also received the revelation that it's important for Christians to take care of themselves! And not just for weight loss (this is not another weight loss book), but for all-over, inside/outside glowing health. How are we supposed to completely fulfill God's call on our lives if we're sick or depressed all the time, if our appearance gives a bad testimony, or if we die prematurely? I did find Stormie's plan a bit rigid (thus the 8 instead of a 10 rating), but you can adapt it to suit yourself as I have--exposure to the principles she mentions is more than worthwhile. I work with people struggling with eating disorders, and I consider this book basically a MUST READ"
2,"Wonderful series, bad price!","Two stars for this wonderful series, that deserves at least five of them. But Amazon sells the last two season for a price that accumulates to the same price the Complete Series edition costs. And there is not price adjustment in sight ... oh well, I'm not buying the complete series edition since I already own the first three in single season editions ... but I'm also not buying the seperate editions at this price. It's a great thing to have the choice."
2,WHEN is this going to be available at an affordable price??,"Can anyone help out with the above? The fourth (and fifth!)seasons have been available for some time but still don't seem to have gone down in price, in spite of the fact that the first three seasons have! I think they're just TOO expensive. I loved Seasons 1-3 and I'm sure Seasons 4 and 5 are as good. Come on Amazon sellers, lower your costs, please!!By the way the rating reflects my views on the cost, not the show itself..."
3,what else can go on,this is not a bad season but realy how many more things can go on in there lives
2,disappointed,"I have received other DVDs in this series, and have been very happy with One, Two and Three, however, this particular one was flawed even though it came completely sealed. There were four DVDs in the set and the second one was unwatchable"
4,Format: Box or not ??,"I love QAF so much!!!! and I bought also the first 3 seasons, but just one question: why they changed the format?? why this 4th season is in Closed-captioned and not in box like the others??"
4,Really enjoyed,I missed the original airing of the series fourth season. Was glad to get all the episodes and watch as a marathon session.
2,Bad season,"This was a tragic season for QAF. Sad, depressing and uninspiring. I didn't care about any of the characters in this season, and I wanted it to end after the first few episodes. Nothing is resolved between anyone: Emmitt and Ted go down a dark path; Melanie and Lynsey split up (surprise, surprise); Brian gets cancer; and Michael and Ben have to deal with a prostitute's lifestyle change instead of coping with their own; and Justin is just plain boring. Same old thing. I was very dissapointed with this show at the end of the series. I hope season five sparks my flame and keeps me watching."
3,Great Show--What is with this case?????????,"I love Queer as Folk. I own all the previous collector sets. NOW, however, I have this 4th season with this cheezy box set? As a collector I look at the overall look of the set and have really loved the way they had packadged this series and, of course, a fan of a very exciting series. Then this box shows up and has crushed my collection. This does not go with the first 3 collectors editions. WHAT>>>>>>>>>>>>> KILL ME!!!! What were they thinking.. I haven't even opened it yet as I am still in shock of seeing it. I could of used TIVO........ CHANGE THIS BOX PLEASE!!!!!!!"
4,5 stars for content...1 star for packaging...,"I'm sure as most you have read in the previous comments, the packaging to this season is nowhere NEAR as good as the previous seasons. That's extremely true. The packaging is VERY fragile and basically four large DVD covers in a paper-thin box. The other seasons came with more bonus features, more thought behind the look of the boxes, and a lot more thought in general. Some have speculated that Showtime is setting aside the money that was saved from this season's box set so that the fifth (and final) DVD would be much more extravagant and worth the money.The content (excluding bonus features) is absolutely amazing. The shows are great, the plot is fantastic, and the characters are as real and unpredictable as everyday life. So if you love the show, buy the set, it'll be worth it. Don't get it for the packaging or the non-existent bonus features, get it for what the box set is all about this season, the show."
3,Awsome Show!! But....,"I love Queer As Folk! I find it extremely entertaining to watch. I also love the characters and the story-lines. But why am I paying almost 100$ for only 13 episodes? I think it's an outragous price for basically a half season order. I can appreciate the special features, but honestly I'd rather have more meat(no pun). The same idea I apply for the first, second and third seasons as well. Many DVDs series containing 22 episodes are usually under 80$ with tax included. Anyways I've got nothing against Queer As Folk or anything like that, I just think it's a rip-off. Well there is my rant. Cheers!!"
4,Great Set horrible packaging,"I hadn't had the money to complete my boxed set series of the show, so i finally got season 4 i excitedly opened the plastic and looked at the cheap packaging and said ""what the hell!!!"" the packaging isn't as nice as the other 3 seasons, and that kind of bothered me since now my seasons do not match. I have 3 seasons in beautiful boxed sets with fold out areas for the disks and I can SEE what i am paying so much for (i spent over 100 dollars for the first season's set).well the season 4 shows in my eyes were not as good as previous years but i still enjoy the show. so it is a MUST HAVE for any QAF fan.I was bummed by not having as many ""extras"" as other seasons which was really a let down, since I had gotten so used to be spoiled by extras.But like i said this set is a must have for those who are truly into QAF and need to own every single ep.I can't wait to see season 5's dvd set hopefully they are back to the beautiful packaging and have tons of extras."
1,Not worth the money,"First let me say that I love Queer as Folk and up until this season, I bought the DVDs and merchandise. However, when I heard that this season offered very little in the way of extras about QAF and more about the actor's other projects and Showtime's other projects, I decided not to buy them. I already have the episodes on DVD so I don't need them to watch S4.What I buy DVDs for are the blooper reels and any extra interviews that they do with the cast about QAF. The S4 DVD release is a huge disappoinment in that respect. If you've seen S4, save your money for something more worthwhile because you're not getting any extras from Showtime on this series."
2,Really Dull!!!,"I've watched all the previous seasons of this series and thought for the most part they were pretty good. But, Season 4 is where I lost interest - it felt very forced, annoyingly PC, and unbearably pedestrian. As I struggled to get through it, I constantly found myself thinking ""the writers have run out of ideas"" - the storylines were just too mediocre and outright boring. Every good thing must come to an end, and Season 4 marked the decline of an otherwise landmark series that redifined the depiction of gay/lesbian people on television."
5,And three is a menage a trois,"Further adventures of the QAF folk, although by now they are getting a little think, but don't they always."
2,Amateurish,"I'm sorry to be negative, but I feel that the two previous reviews are misleading. They implied I'd be hearing some fabulous unknown here--but no, this is a charming program sung by a roundly second-rate artist. Mager's voice has an unpleasant raspy quality which is completely unsuited to classical song and perhaps to high notes altogether. There's also the occasional breathiness and pitch instability. If you're used to hearing Susan Graham sing Hahn and Janet Baker sing Faure, be prepared for a disconcerting experience. There's a reason this CD is not on a major label. Mager is somewhat more credible on the popular songs, however, and perhaps she'll concentrate on those in the future. The one 100% enjoyable and polished song on the CD is ""Mister Georgina""--we want more like that!"
1,No no no no,"Wonderful selections, but if we are looking for a beautiful voice this is not it. Screechy, forced, at times unlistenable. Sometimes we just have to no when to say no!"
5,great album,"these guys are great. i went on their site a long time before their album came out, theyre some cool guys. this cd has some great songs and unique lyrics. shining sun and debris are some of my favorites. this cd has a good flow and is great to listen too in any mood. I loved this album and am sure u probably wil too."
4,I hope she reads it!,I bought this handy book for my step-daughter hoping she would read it and learn about her car. I read it over an hour and was impressed with the presentation and thoroughness. I'd recommend this book to any women that feels they need a basic knowledge of the workings of their car and how to deal with mechanics.
5,Track List,Track List1. Watch Me2. Stand3. Bleed on Both Sides4. Fata Morgana5. Letting Go6. Do You7. Fermented Olives8. Step Back9. Stomp
2,A Disappointed Long Time Fan...AYGWM? IS incomplete,"Like the Speaking of Now album, this DVD is a mediocre effort by a heretofore outstanding unit.With regards to the listing of track 12 as Are You Going With Me?:What masquerades as Are You Going With Me?, on the DVD, is only the three and a half minute intro of the 12 minute plus composition of AYGWM? played on the North American and European Tours. The DVD offering is a combination of Into the Dream with Metheny on Pikasso guitar and the melody of AYGWM? performed by Cuong Vu on trumpet. A full blown and majestic presentation of AYGWM? was the highlight of a bland tour of the States and Europe. It deserved a far better presentation than the one offered on this DVD."
4,Pat always bring magic,"I reckon this is the first live concert DVD by Pat Metheny in 5 years. Correct me if I'm wrong.But since the Imaginary Day Concert, Pat has proved himself to be a virtuoso that no one to be compared with.As for myself, the DVD here marks his journey of musicianship throughout the year. And not to mention with the new line-up, Cuong Vu on trumpets and vocals, Antonio Sanchez, bring new colour to Pat's music."
4,it's ok for the price... but,"one thing i did notice and never even thought of is that it only has 1 control for the whole movement.unlike the other model 488rc2""A separate lock on the panoramic axis allows for rotation adjustment or panning to be carried out without losing framing.""as another reviewer stated, it did not specify panning. so I added another star."
5,Just what I needed,"This ball head is exactly what I hoped it would be. Compact, durable and easy to use. I think there is a slight learning curve with these, but once you get the hang of it its so much easier just having the one knob to worry about.I was looking at the Manfrotto 486RC2, but from what I read the 484RC2 is just as good if not better.Im using this with the Manfrotto 190XPROB and the Canon 5d."
3,Installing is not easy,"I have two manfrotto tripods with 501 heads. I've yet to figure out how to remove the 501s and install the mini-ball head. Am considering getting a third tripod, specifically for photography."
4,how spirited,"i simply find unique joy and peace in this outstanding book. suprised no one has read it, i give it two thumbs up. :7"
2,Leslie Sansone walking DVD,This is not one of Leslie's better DVDs. It is obviously one of her earlier ones. Not as professional as her later DVDs.
4,Good DVD for a person my Age.,"It's a good program. The only thing it doesn't do is make me do the exercises!! It's a good way to walk, better than a treadmill!!"
3,Seems the same,I found this DVD about the same as her other workouts--didn't see much difference and regretted that I purchased it as I have the beginning one.
1,Absolute WORST Leslie DVD,"The absolute WORST Leslie Sansone DVD. Done live in her studio there are many things I didn't like. I got this thinking it would have thoughtful geriatric material - it doesn't. It was the same stuff she does on her other DVDs except less coordinated, badly scripted, and poorly taped. I am a big fan of Leslie and I have over a dozen of her DVDs. ANY of Leslie's DVDs would be a better choice than this one. It was quite a disappointment."
5,very good,"This is very good to show older or less mobile people how they can be physically active without fear. I thought it was delivered in a very encouraging manner, good to see real seniors going through the routines (instead of young slim things in stretchies!)"
5,Great Exwecise for Seniors,"I bought ths DVD for my mother (91) and me (72) to do together. It's fun and easy to follow for both of us. If we can do it, anyone who can walk to their front gate and back can do it. I suggest you start with less than the 30 minutes of the whole routine if you have not been exercising regularly. Also check with your doctor first. It's low impact, moderate intensity. We started with 10 minutes, using a timer. We've increased the time a minute each week and we're up to 17 minutes. We're going for the entire distance slowly but steadily, and we already see a big difference in how we feel, how we move, and our stamina. Highly recommend this DVD if you need to get in shape."
2,Leslie Sansone for seniors,"First of all it was hard to hear the music, which it important. I have had other of her videos and the music is better. I just did not like this one."
3,Journey of Life Necklace,Great gift for a graduate who is headed into the world. Won't break the bank.
3,Pretty. Poor fit for anyone over 12 years old.,"I bought these for High school/College graduates. Unfortunately, the cord length for the necklace is rather short. Both girls loved the necklace, the idea behind it, but had to put the pendant on another chain/cord."
2,Flew off,This wing flew off the car when it was being towed backwards at 70 MPH. You would think the glue should have held. Ha Ha
5,The Courage to Love,"After reading this book , I realized what tremendous courage ittook for her to write about her affair with Buck O'neil. The detailsare so good that I may read it again just to get it all. I hope thatthis affair paves the way for more women or couples who share the same discrimination in their lifes because of a age that she had to bare. This is what change is all about. The book is a definite page-turner and a good read."
1,18 month old hates it,"It's true, Jake is adorable and irresistible, but I have major issues. My 18 month grandson was skeptical at first, but willing to give it a try. Within 10 minutes poor Jake was discarded.The baseball cap won't stay on. The velcro shoe was a waste; he learned more when putting on his own shoes. The hoodie won't fit over Jake's head. The zipper is too difficult even for me! My grandson learned how to use a zipper with his backpack.The velcro watch could be anything-it sure doesn't look like a watch, and it's unlikely kids will relate to it. He might learn to button and snap with Jake's help, but it's easier to teach him with his own clothes.He's now over two years old and he still doesn't like the doll, so it's not an ""age-thing"" for him. Jake is hidden under my grandson's bed, that's how much he hates it.I wish I had success with this doll, the reviews really encouraged me."
3,Choking hazard?????,"I am seriously considering purchasing this for my 16 month old. It says that it's for 12 month olds, but then there's that choking warning. What is that all about???? If there is a choking hazard with this and other similar toys such as Dapper Dan and that learning to dress monkey, why can't I find any info on the CPSC website???? Can someone please tell me what the choking hazard is????"
2,Didn't even open the package...,Not sure where this box was kept in the warehouse but the plastic covering the package was dusty and yellow with a few small holes...and I guess I thought there were more types of buttons and mechanisms for the child to practice on. Didn't get to actually play with the toy as I returned it immediately...but up close I don't think it would have held my 3 year old's interest long. Cute idea...but I'm going to shop around for another style.
3,we'll see,Bought this for our 16mo old grandson. He really hasn't shown much interest in it. I may have bought it prematurely. I guess we'll see.
4,"Cute, but son not interested","I purchased the Learn-to-Dress Jake doll for my 16 month old son (Christmas gift). He seemed to enjoy ""playing"" with his older sisters dolls so I thought for sure he would like the Jake doll. Jake is very cute and I love that you can remove his shoes, hat, jacket and skateboard. I knew my son would not be able to work the zipper or tie the shoe, but I thought he would at least like undressing the doll. Unfortunately, Jake has gotten very little play time. My only hope is my son will eventually want to play more with Jake. Doll seems to be well made and overall I am happy with my purchase... just wish my son liked it more!"
4,Simplicity In Action,"Easy to use and long enough to be great around plants with thorns or thick growth. Best way to load it with powder is to use a flexible, plastic cutting board dedicated to garden use. A funnel made from a chlorine bleach bottle will also work. We dedicate one of the spritzers to dispensing cayenne pepper spice all over the roses, azaleas and garden ground to deter dogs, cats, deer and racoon in Zone 7b Alabama. Since rain washes the deterrent away, we just have one of these loaded all the time for a fast, easy way to retreat the area. Short, fast strokes give you the best burst for your effort. Easy to clean with a hose."
2,delayed shipment and the unit clogs on the garden dust,"This was ordered on April 30th and they didn't ship until May 11th. Way too long of a delay. The item didn't arrive until today, May 14th. My initial experience has been that it becomes frequently clogged with the garden dust. I have had to carry a small probe with me in order to clear the nozzzle. Bummer."
3,"Brief sumary, little detail","If you are like me and have read quite a bit regarding JFK, you will also likely be disappointed in this book. It is a brief summary of certain management techniques and little flourishes, (e.g. ""find your Bobby""), that may have some historical reference but serious litle duplicative managent skills.If you're a new reader to this fascinating period of presidential history and world politics, you might find this boook interesting reading."
1,Agreed that ZERO stars is the proper rating,"These discs do not play in any of my DVD players (I have several). Amazon should not be selling DVDrs that do not play in regular DVD players. Amazon, please fix your product and when you do so I will be happy to review the content."
2,mis leading and read carefully,The dvds are hardly uncensored and read details carefully as I had to use my computer to watch them. They will not play in my dvd player....I have never bought a dvd with purple bottoms.
2,Codeword Atrocious,"""A-List: New York"" is the gay all-male equivalent toThe Real Housewives of New Jersey: Season OneandThe Real Housewives of Orange County - Season One. The men in here are definitely drama queens, from Reichen who was inThe Amazing Race - The Seventh Seasonwith his then-partner Chip, to the flamboyant celebrity photographer Mike Ruiz, paunchy former model Austin (who once dated Marc Jacobs) and a cherubic hairdresser with his partner TJ. There's plenty of drama, drama, drama, between the narcissistic Austin and the hot Brazilian Rodiney. It's vacuous, image-centered, with plenty of shirtless guys... but it's to be expected. It's simply a homoerotic variation on reality TV. Like most reality TV, it shows people at their worst. Ironic... considering that Reichen was in the uplifting, inspirational ""Amazing Race."" He even WON in that show. But everybody is a loser in this one."
3,English Toughman Contests,"A bit over edited to add drama, but has some good fights. Reminds me of Toughman contests with the short rounds and occasional missmatches. I got this DVD because I was training for a Toughman match and they are very different from Amature or Pro boxing.If you like Toughman, you'll like these."
5,Exceptional talent!,"Exceptional talent from both artists, great listening with both traditional and orginal songs. A must have for every bluegrass fan and those who just appreciate great music!"
5,awesome,"if ever it happens, this series will help with outdoor survival. wish there were more. always good to know who knows one day we all may need it."
3,Missing the episodes?,"I am a hugh bear grylls fan. I own his book, watched all of his episodes, bought his knife.So I was expecting to see some urban survival techniques from the season 6,but I couldn't find them in this DVD. For some reason, they have decided not to include some episodes from season 6 which is a big disappointment for me."
2,Needs work,"I agree with much of what's posted here. This could have been a very good book with the help of an experienced co-author. Lots of action, and maybe it will be a best-seller. Best-seller and good have never travelled together much anyway.PARTIAL SPOILER FOLLOWS - SKIP IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.The ending reminded me about the old Liars' Club story in which the teller describes being caught in a box canyon with a rattlesnake on one side, a mountain lion on the other, and a ticking time bomb just out of reach. He ends the story in a way that forces the question, ""So what happened?"" and replies, ""Why, I died, of course!"" Pfui.It's very easy to go astray with stories about cloning. I've read several, and the general result is usually a plot that degenerates into ""No, you see, I made a copy of the copy and substituted ...."" until the reader gives up."
3,fast-paced but derivative,"Cox's fast pace and keep-`em-guessing twists keep the reader going well after the premise has begun to recall several Hollywood movies involving instant human transportation. Bored with his job, Cameron Fisher agrees to test a teleportation device for $5 million dollars severance pay. It seems to work fine, but then his body begins playing tricks on him, he can't tell friend from foe and he's running for his life. Cox's characters are one-dimensional, but his debut is a plot-driven one-sitting read with lots of hairpin turns."
4,Penny Gold,"This is a pretty typical 1973 movie... The music is very loud, and the voices of the actors are a bit hard to understand, especially the outdoor scenes. (So much background noise).I'm sure this has a lot to do with the fact that an old movie was made into a DVD, and I'm sure the editors tried to clean up the tones as well as they could.Francesca Annis is beautiful, as always, and the ending was well worth trying to listen through the slow parts.Overall, a pretty good movie."
3,"Subtitles, please!",English subtitles would have helped immensely. The dialogue was virtually impossible to understand: James Booth particularly. It was a real struggle to follow what was being said.
3,"Mom, of a soon to be 5 yr old girl!!","I just got this bike for my soon to be 5 yr old daughter (Emily).This bike is durable - considering Emily has fallen down on it quite a few times. This bike has gold specks all over it, like confetti - for decoration. I don't like the specks it makes the bike look dirty and scratched. Also the maker Dynacraft - needs to make the streamers more durable! About 1 hour after we got the bike home, Emily fell down with the bike, and the streamers broke on it! I did not like that.Also the Bar in the middle of the bike, where the pad goes, doesn't really fit! The pad gets all bunched up! If you're reading this Dynacraft you should make the middle bar a little more higher or straighter.Other than these flaws this is a good bike."
4,Detailed info how the car should be,"It is not a buyers guide, but it shows details of the cars i have not seen in other books. It really helps to improve your car. Although i am aware that every Ferrari of the sixties differs from each other."
3,Ferraris in Color,"Really nice color pictures with shots of the dash and interior on many of the models featured. Occasional under the hood photos are included. These are all ""road"" cars rather than the track cars. Useful for modellers. No drawings of chassis, suspensions or engines which is the only reason this book does not get a higher rating from me."
5,Best for Understanding the Internet and for learning it!,"This 'everybody's guide of the Internet' is a very useful to understand the Internet. I recommend it the fundamental guide for learn all programs such like WWW, FTP, email,Telnet,gopher and many others. Youngkil Park Ph.D ykppharm@mail.hitel.net MokpCity/Korea"
5,Beautiful and functional,"I got this bag as a gift for my teenage daughter, and she was delighted with it. Stylish fabrics and clever reversible design make this bag fun as well as functional!"
1,Does not work with US Phones,The BLD-3 model has two different batteries: One for the Asian market and one for the US market. The Asian market batteries are slightly bigger and are not recognized by the phone. The batteries I purchased were for the Asian market and did not work in my Nokia 6200 US phone.
4,This book is a helpful tool for releasing negative feelings.,"This is a great follow up to her book, Feelings Buried Alive Never Die. I know that these things can make a big difference in our quality of life."
1,These struts dont seem to be what the picture says they are,"Ok so I got the struts about a week and a half ago, got them installed a couple days ago. My first impression from the packaging was pretty bad, first of all, they were suppose to be ""monroe"" struts and on the the box it self it had no sign of them being Monroe besides this little sticker that had the Monroe logo on it, then once opened up the box, the struts had no monroe stickers like the picture shows and they didn't have that gold part on the upper part of the strut. I am very disssapoitned with the purchase, my car doesn't ride as good as I expected since in my opinion they dont seem to be the original Monroe part that I attempted to order, I would return them if I could but they are already installed in my car."
4,Priced right,"The struts I received where not the same in picture,but was the right ones for car,the struts i received where 801525 monroe part number,but i did buy them used-like new,they where still new just boxes where damaged"
4,great read!,"I loved this book. It was fourth in a series of 5 books, and was the hardest to find. Fortunately, it was worth the work, and worth the wait. Great read, I totally recommend it. I recommend the entire series, actually."
3,Easy to read ... but sadly lacking,"I recently discovered Susan Mallery and this was the first of a few of her books that I have purchased. I must say, I was quite disappointed with this book as from the reviews I read of her other books, I expected a whole lot more.I found the characters lacking depth and the story line was very loosely held together. Therefore, I rated this book a three. Just hoping that the other books I have bought are better than this one!"
4,"can't go wrong, especially for the price","if you're into the early 90's Brit-pop scene a la Stone Roses, Charlatan's, James, etc. surely you know the Candyskins. Space I'm In has several good singles on it ""Submarine Song"", ""Freedom Bus"" and ""She Blew Me Away."" Anyone who listed to ""alternative"" radio back in the day (when it was good and before the label ""alternative"") surely would have heard some of these songs. I picked it up back then and still listen to it today. Good CD for being able to buy it so cheaply today (~ $.75).""Fun?"" and ""Death of a Minor TV Celebrity"" are also worthy!"
4,"Ah, the bargain bin","Honestly, the Amazon bargain bin always houses gems.Oxford's The Candy Skins, another middle of the road English band (in popularity terms), scored a minor hit with Stateside with ""Submarine Song"". Its trademark bassline should bring back memories to college radio listeners.This is a nice little CD that avoids sounding dated. You can pretty much throw pop darts at ""Freedom Bus"", ""She Blew Me Away"" and ""Get Together"" (my favorite) and hit a bullseye with each.A great way to spend a buck or two. Recommended."
4,Good times!,"I bought this CD because I owned the cassette when I was in high school. It was great to musically reminisce about the old days. If you like the classic 80's alternative, rolling guitar style of music, you'll enjoy this disc."
1,Grape Leaves: A century of Arab-American Poetry,Gibran was not an Arab. He was an Lebanese Assyrian. This intellectual ethnic genocide needs to STOP.
5,Perfect for freezer organization,I had been looking for something that would fit nicely on the top shelf of my freezer to keep it more organized and these are doing the job perfectly. My only complaint is that I paid almost as much for shipping as for the item and it took nine days to get to me where other free shipping items arrived in 3-4 days.
4,Freezer baskets,"The freezer baskets were just what I wanted for my small chest type freezer. They do not stack, however, but they did fit neatly in the bottom of my freezer. I was thrilled to be able to find them as they are a difficult item to buy."
5,Great!,I really liked these movies! I haven't seen them in years so it was great to see them together on one DVD.
5,Eye popping Folio !!!!,"This is an excellent edition of Antique Maps reprinted in large format, most of them double page, within a folio(coffee table) size book to begin with. Reproduction quality is very good, all in color, the content informative and not long winded dribble because- most people buy a book such as this for the maps-images.I would grab a copy now while the price is low, books like this seem to live a quite life on the shelf, then disappear and then later only available in the used marketplace at a premium."
4,Is it worth about a dollar a minute?,"Yes, if you're already a fan. I assume you are if you're reading this. Otherwise, stick with the albums. The surf-rock touches I always wished Hot Snakes would extend and elaborate upon surface briefly here and there, which adds to its appeal. The extreme brevity may be due to the fact that if John Peel had lived longer, the band might have added a couple more four-tune sessions before releasing this. Why this band does not jam a bit and delve more deeply into their swirl puzzles me. Rumors are that the band may be at an end, so perhaps this is an epitaph not only for the late great Mr. Peel, but for the Snakes."
1,Need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker,"My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift. You need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker to use this kit. No where in the online description of this toy on Amazon does it tell you this. Toy is being returned b/c we don't have the bead maker."
3,Ahead of it's time,"After having read this soon after it came out, has anyone else noticed that this book was redone - minus the Shadowrun Setting - as The Da Vinci Code? Bloodline of Christ discovered by Globetrotting band of eccentrics by examining Renassiance Art. Whereas the Authors of ""..Holy Grail.."" have sued the Da Vinci Code authors, Carl Sargent has a much better case.It was also interesting to see the dificulties that this work put on future authors of Shadowrun Universe books - since the Leonardo Charachter is such a force in that world completely un-hinted at until this novel. Not particularly well written - DEFINITELY not the Gritty Cyberpunk Shadowrun of Nigel D. Findley, but an interesting read."
1,The book was a religously bigoted piece of claptrap.,"The Entire concept I found Offensive and highly implausable (hey...vatican nukes anyone?) MG &CS have always been below average writers who must have an in with SOMEONE at FASA to keep getting paid for their wastes of paper. If any other religion was portrayed as false by those two, FASA would have spiked the book there and then. But I guess Catholicism is an easy target."
4,Opinion,"Short and sweet:Read the book just because of the character Streak - I ain't kidding, he makes the book worth reading.Character descriptions are vague. Interactions between main chars and 'enemies' are poor and confusing. The concept of 'shadowrunners' (which these guys definitely are NOT) living in luxury is a refreshing change from the 'live-in-squallor' standard of most runner-types. I hate the Vatican so I took some pleasure in the idea that they would flex their muscle in the world of SR just to prevent the masses from learning something OTHER than what has been spoon-fed to them by Christianity. The writing style conveys the sense of the dark and gritty world of London. This book would have rated a Five had the descriptions and interactions been better."
4,From dark to light,"There are a few other books which explore the topic of newly found words of Jesus or ""Q"" specifically. The subject lends itself nicely to intrigue and suspense. Blake adds the edge of spiritual angst. She also has a few passages which are great for sermon fodder.Way back in seminary I found the idea of text criticism fascinating. If my ancient language skills were better it would have been even more interesting. Blake's book may be a good one to help explain to lay people about how the Bible came to be. It would certainly create some serious questions.The use of present tense, while incredibly annoying at times, gives a distinct impression of Lily's detachment from her present life. I expect the next book will have something to do with her relationship to her parents and deepening (I hope) relationship with Tom.All in all the book was good. I'm looking forward to the next one."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I am more than disappointed in the content of this book. It is very poorly written with glaring grammatical and editing errors and does not even begin to address the expectations of the reader. I was anticipating a book that would be informative about the marketing aspects of Home Care (which is on the cover, by the way!) Instead, I found a cheap, low budget beginner lesson about topics that anyone with any common sense would already know. Shame on me, I should have read the comments first."
1,Lacking Specific Content,"This publication is basically a general marketing digest/workbook derived from various sources. There are only a few paragraphs that relate to Home Care Agencies and/or Elder Care Agencies; this was very dissapointing to me. I expected more.A person could put the title, ""Marketing Strategies for _________""; fill in the blank to anything they want, change a few paragraphs to match the title, and whamo! -- a brand new book. That's what this ""book"" appeared to be."
2,Egads!!!,"This book is a shocker!!! I was seriously dismayed that a book would be published with the amount of grammatical errors and typos that this book contained. The info is basic and not very useful at the professional level.I spent $20.00 on this small paperback, its worth closer to $5."
3,Bit outdated collection of football writings,This collection is something for you if you followed English football between the years of 1970 - 1990's. Alternatively it may interest you if you are a fan of Nick Hornby and read all his books already. Otherwise there is not that much for the rest of us to read.
5,Very Helpful,"I bought McKenzie's back book about 15 years ago, and it helped me so much. Now that I'm having neck problems, and my DO nor my PT seem to help, I gave this a try. Within a few days I was much better. The exercises are similar, but much better explained in the book than my PT could describe. And I feel vindicated that my neck issues were causing my tension headaches, as described in the book. I wish that I had bought this book 2.5 years ago, when the neck probelms started. I have been able to centralize the pain and feel it diminishing. I highly recommend this neck book, and the back book, ""Treat Your Own Back""."
5,Excellent book,"My physician recommended this book because I was having ongoing neck and shoulder pain. I got it and started doing the exercises, and they really have worked. I have gotten much relief."
5,Great Product,Treat Your Own Neck was a great product for the price. There were some really good tips that helped with my neckpain. Definitely worth a try if you have neck pain that just won't seem to go away.
3,It's an infomercial on paper.,There are useful suggestions mixed among a lot of advertising for the author's commercialized methods of treatment. This detracts from its authenticity IMHO.
2,Won't help everyone.,Maybe my neck pain is past the point that this book can be of any help to. It seems the author suggests the same few exercises for everyone's neck pain. Hard to believe this would help me. Maybe others. Sorry.
3,Neck,As expected......gives good practical hints to treat neck problems at home... and prevention of them.To insist on more words is a nuisance.....and no need for it.
3,Not much help,"This book doesn't give any info that you can't easily find on the Internet. It's so similar to the other ""7 Steps to a Pain-Free Life: How to Rapidly Relieve Back and Neck Pain"" that it was a waste of money."
2,Neck Book,It was a OK read but i was hoping to learn more then i did.A short & easy to read & easy to understand.
5,Robin McKenzie Neck book,"Fantastic book, this book can get you back on your feet. For more than a year now I continue to see improvement in my range of motion."
3,Some improvement,"The exercises have definitely helped, but since my problem has been around for a number of years, I think it is too early to say I am ""cured"". The pain is certainly lessened and I am hopeful, that with continued exercises, the pain will continue to improve."
2,Not much to it,"I really wasn't expecting too much from this book, mainly some helpful tips and examples that would help me with my stiff, sore neck. Nothing new was in it that you couldn't pull up from the internet, plus much more...."
4,informative,"This is a useful book. I have rather sever cervical stenosis and the proposed exercises seem to help. Of course all treatment approach require discipline and this approach is no different, Y gotta keep with the program!"
5,Treat Your Own Neck,This book was recommended to me by my surgeon who operated on my neck 6 months ago and I had residual shoulder and neck pain. This is a great adjunct to physical therapy sessions.
1,Neck Exercises,Didn't find this book of much help. Was recommended by my dentist as he has neck and back problems also. Information in this book is not much different than I've been given by my physical therapist. All but one I have already been doing. Might help someone who has not had therapy and wants to know what to do for neck problems.
4,Treat your own pain in the neck,"I can not speak first hand on this as it was a gift for my Aunt, she said she has found the exercises very helpful in relieving her chronic pain.What I was impressed with, is that while searching for books for my Aunt, I emailed the author and asked if the book had illustrations. They responded the next day with some of the illustrations attached."
5,Treat your own neck,"A very helpful and educational book. Explains the reasons why strain reverts and people have to back to chiropractors over and over , and gives exercises so you can treat yourself at home."
5,Cured!!!!!!!!,"I have suffered from neck pain since elementary school, cracking of joints led to pain, led to mobility problems, led to sever pain, led to extreme pain in shoulder blades, lower back etc - it has interfered with training - even led to a rib dislocation. I have done physio, chiro, for over a year at a high cost in time and money - then I found this book. It is not about strengthening but about doing stretches in the right way to increase flexibility and automatically realign yourself when you feel the need. I am now grappling and training with none of the previous pain, UFC here I comeSimple yet effectiveBuy this book"
2,One Exercise Was Helpful - The Others Made My Neck Worse,"I have had a sore neck on one side for several months now and go to physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture for the last three months to try and heal it. I bought this book hoping it would help.This book has a few simple exercises to treat your own neck. I found one of the exercises (The Lying Down Neck Flexion) to be helpful for me to relieve the pain, but the others (Neck Extension, Sideways & Twist) caused more pain and really hurt my neck. My physiotherapist said that the information in this book is generic and doesn't necessarily heal all neck pain...which was the case for me as I still have the neck pain."
4,Works. A few pages and a few excercises but it helped.,I went to a chiropractor that manipulated my neck. That gave me problems like pins and needles in my right hand and spasms in eyelid. Doing McKenzies stuff for 3 days reduced this and a few days later it popped in my neck and I'm almost entirely free from the problem.
5,My best purchase ever,"I am a 55 year old computer programmer diagnosed for the past 10 years with cervical spondylosis, which produces frequent and prolonged headaches. In my case, the medical community has been focused only on diagnosis (MRIs) and treatment (NSAIDs and muscle relaxants), not prevention. Over the years I have checked medical web sites for information, but just recently stumbled upon this book at Amazon. By following the common sense advice and exercises described by Dr. McKenzie, I am now headache and medication free. (My only advice is to go easy on the exercises when starting.) This tiny book is a miracle of Biblical proportions."
5,Lifesaver,"This book is so basic, simple and effective that you wonder how it isn't given away by the insurance companies. After years of neck and shoulder pain I went to a Neurosurgeon to get surgery. I was fortunate enough to get referred to a doctor with enough integrity to recommend this book. The pain started minimizing after the first set of exercises. The pain was virtually gone after 3 days and has been gone for about 6 months solely from continuing to follow the exercises. Try this book, it will change your life."
5,Chronic Neck Pain,"Treat Your Own Neck(tm)I have been suffering shoulder, arm & neck pain for years. I've had various treatments, pain killers & physical therapy. This book contains simple exercises that provide relief."
3,Oh MY Aching Neck,I would recommend not following the exercises in the book without the supervision of a health care professional as you could cause a greater degree of damage. This is a very complicated problem and very difficult to treat or cure.
5,Not a ton of experience with the book,"So far the book seems to be ok, but I haven't used the techniques long enough to really know whether they are working or not."
1,Doesn't Work,I've been using these exercises for a month and feel no difference in my pain level. I have 4 mm bulging disc and tightened muscles. My true relief comes from going for a massage. I prayed for a miracle. This book was NOT it.
1,Don't bother with this one..,"This book came from a recommendation from my orthopedic.. he informed me there was pretty much nothing I could do about my low back except for ""Quit with the running and high impact exercises"". This book basically tells you to sit up straight, but a back support under your lower back, and lie several times a day on your stomach, and push yourself up on your arms and hold that position to reinstate the arch in your lower back.. well, duh.. If you are in decent shape this one is not for you. I could see where it may help if you are old, overweight, out of shape, and don't know what else to do.."
3,Disc for Singin in the Rain,Three separate discs with each of the musicals on a separate disc. The one we wanted and chose to view first was Singin in the Rain. It would not work. The other two showed beautifully. They were not HD but were viewable. We are really sorry about the Singin in the Rain disc. What are we to do????
1,does not play,"I received 3 different sets of the ""Essential Classics"" movies collection as gifts. NONE of them play without skipping sections. I loved the concept of the set which is why I registered for them on my wish list. Truly disappointed in the quality of the product."
3,2 out of 3 ain't bad??,"Movie arrived bundled with a few others. I was most excited about getting to watch ""Singin' in the Rain"". Unfortunately that movie did not work. My dvd player sat and spun trying to read the disk, but when I tried to play ""Gigi"" and ""My Fair Lady"" it read the disks and began playing them. I'm upset that it doesn't work but I don't want to return the whole set because one disk doesn't work."
3,Musical DVD review,"I must have been sentimental when I ordered this. Wanting to share some ""good old classics"" with my preteen children, I was excited to view the three musicals with them. Gigi should be banned for girls - and boys, as a matter of fact (what were they thinking??); My Fair Lady is entertaining and a classic but not a favorite with my 6-year-old. The only one I truly want to keep and see again is ""Singing in the Rain"", a story with some value - and the approval of all my kids."
4,Knowing Drew,Knowing Drew...I love this collection and am so excited to hear and read more. I love the humor even though it is at a time not meant for humor. Whew haven't we all been crushed to the point of such powerful emotions. Love this collection.Your friendMary L.
5,Tony never Disappoints,I purchased this as a gift after seeing it on PBS--I just had to share it with someone who loves the music of Tony Bennett as much as I. Hope they will have me over to hear it again!!
5,Wonderful,One DVD is the Tony Bennett's biography and the other one is his show on Monterey Jazz Festival in California. If you love Tony and his songs you must have to buy this DVD.
1,PRODUCTION FLOP!,"Just got my copy and I can sqay ""Me, too!"" Both discs (although labeled correctly) contain only the documentary. No concert!!!Someone is going to be in BIG trouble for this flub!"
4,Thumbs up!,"I saw the PBS Special, too, and it got me very interested in TB. Netflix has this same title in a one-disc set -- don't know what their DVD omits. Yes, TB probably shouldn't try to sustain very long notes anymore as his voice cracks, but he's a Master! One hilarious part is Alec Baldwin impersonating him on SNL. AB hosts the ""TB Show"", featuring guest Anthony Benedetto (TB). I'm going to place my order for this DVD set."
1,STOP - DO NOT PURCHASE !,"This 2 set DVD is 2 of the same CD's ! I returned it and purchased another, and AGAIN it was 2 of the same, I returned it again and purchsed 2 used concerts of Tony and spent less money. From other reviews I see that I am not alone in this problem, this DVD needs to be recalled!"
2,Im sure it would be great if both disks werent the same.The concert is missing.,Ive ordered 3 of these in hopes to get the Concert disk- to actually be a concert.Both disks are the same thing- disk 1.Sony didnt even recall them.And they Admitted it!!!They just let us waste our money and figured we would live with it.Typical of a rich corporation nowadays.Boooo on Sony for this.Very WRONG of them to pull such a selfish stunt.
2,Beware 2nd Monterey Concert is a Duplicate of 1st DVD !!!,The 1st DVD is wonderful.However there are apparently a whole bunch of the 2nd DVD labeled as the 2005 Monterey Jazz Concert but it is an exact duplicate of the main DVD.Who do we appeal this to get what we paid for??? No phone number listed for Warner Home Video or Red Envelope Entertainment. Who reimburses our return postage?
2,"Bought a production ""SNAFU""","I am another in the line of people who purchased this DVD and later finding out that both discs were the same. Fortunately I purchased this at a Best Buy store. Took it home, anxious to view the Bonus: Live at The 2005 Monterey Jazz Festival. Then I found out it was the same as the first disc. Returned it the same evening and exchanged it for another. Took it back the next day and told them they may have been sent a ""bad batch"" of DVD's. They didn't want to refund my money at first.They said I would have to exchange it for another. I replied that I would do so only on the condition they opened it and played both discs to make sure I received a good copy.To make a long story short, I had to DEMAND to speak to the manager. I insisted they either refund my money or order another batch. Needless to say, my money was refunded.I really want this DVD. Guess I'll have to wait for the manufacturer to re-release proper copies in the future."
1,Great purchase,"These really didn't do much for me although the package came quickly,even with upping my dosage I still didn't get the desired effect, probably want to go with the tea instead."
4,a good starting point,"Bense writes in a simple, clear style that is easy to understand. Unfortunately the figures referenced in the text are rarely on the same or facing page, so you must flip back and forth to follow the discussion.Because the book covers a vast timespan each cultural period and site only receives a few pages coverage. While this is great as a survey or reference, I found it difficult to get a good picture of the people who produced the sites. However I do have a much better understanding of the scope of native settlement in the Southeast on which to base further study."
1,Doesn't remove all epoxy,"If you are looking to remove the kind of epoxy that is used for floor tiles, look elsewhere. This didn't even make an impression on the epoxy stains on my rubber floor."
3,Cheaply Made,"""This product is not worth what they charge for it.. NOT THAT ONES HAS A CHOICE!!! Very thin wall metal, with Plastic corners, and no bag to put them in..."" You might be better off building your own out of PVC."
4,Very Well Balanced and Light Weight,Sharp. Although could be a little sharper so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Good knife for chopping vegetables. Good on meat-probably be even better if meat was partially frozen. Cut through pork ribs-no problem.I recommend this as a good overall chopping knife.
3,"It cuts, but it's cheap, and it shows","Sure, it cuts. But it's cheap, and it shows.The metal is poor quality: it will get rust stains pretty soon unless you're very careful about washing and drying after each use. The matte finish is ugly and sticks to the food. The handle looks like (is?) cheap plastic, and the sharp point is annoying if you like to push the blade down with your left hand.I really wanted to like this knife, but I think after 6 months it's already time for me to upgrade."
5,You'll never use another knife!,"This is the best knife I've ever used. Breeze through carrots, meats, you name it. Very precise cuts. I love it"
5,"Great Knife, Very sharp.","This is a great knife, very sharp, holds an edge very well. Very good for precision cuts. After a while my hand gets a little tired from holding the knife. Otherwise a great knife"
5,"Fabulous, just fabulous","In my business, I see scores of books with potential value to the business world. I can say without reservation that Lydia Ramsey's newest publication, MANNERS THAT SELL, outshines anything I have seen in a very long time. Easy to read, interesting, and most importantly, filled with critical information you don't get anyplace else, this book is an absolute must for anyone remotely thinking about success in today's business world. In other words, if you want to get in, or stay in a customer's door, don't leave home without MANNERS THAT SELL!"
3,Masada steps out,"Masada's debut is pretty heady. A lot of free jazz stylings, more, perhaps, than any other Masada release. This album is technically amazing of course and very groundbreaking in its time, but it lacks some of the soul and heart of subsequent releases (particularly Vol. 2 and Vol. 4). Since all of the aforementioned albums were recorded on the same day(!), it boggles my mind why Zorn would release this particular collection first. I'm sure there's some rhyme or reason to it; I just can't find any. If it hadn't been fort the next three albums, I would like this one a lot more and that would be reflected in its rating. A good album."
4,Reliable product for my old Clie,Purchased this to add data capacity for my Sony Clie. It has worked flawlessly for many years...not much else to add. I have confidence in Lexar products and would buy this again as a lower cost alternative to the Sony memory sticks.
3,SHOE SIZES,"THE SHOES WERE CUTE, HOWEVER THE SIZES WERE NOT ACCURATE. I USUALLY WEAR A 9 - 9.5, AND ORDERED THE SIZE 10 AND THERE WAS NO WAY THEY WOULD FIT, NOT EVEN CLOSE. SO I HAD TO RETURN THEM."
3,Good Content,"I thought that this story had a good storyline to it. But it was confusing to read, often times the author had put paragraphs in the wrong places. Also there were a lot of typing errors. It was frustrating to read because she never told you who was speaking. I often had to read parts of the story several times, and sometimes I still couldn't figure out who was speaking. I thought that the content of this book was good for young readers, because I often have the Same feelings as the characters in the book, and it kind of helps you understand that you're not the only one who feels this way."
4,One of the Best,this was one of the best shows i've ever watched. i'm definately ready for the movie next year
5,Great show -- greatly missed,This show had so much depth and intelligence to it. I guess the dumbing down of America started with the executive branch and moved to all executives. Such a pity. Get the DVD's and watch them all in a row-- what a plesure!
4,Even better than the first season,"So you like dark comedy and are considering delving into ""Dead Like Me"", right? Good choice. Especially if you don't mind laughing around the topic of death, which actually is a great way to deal with it. In a nutshell, whereas the first season was about how George was getting used to being a reaper, the second season explores the other characters as well as some interesting and unique deaths. Some of them are downright hysterical and some are incredibly touching. This season is wonderful.If I had one complaint it would be the excessive use of the ""f"" word. Don't get me wrong, I swear like a sailor myself, but the ""f"" word is so overused in this season as a noun, verb and adjective in every sentence it gets annoying after awhile and is a bit distracting. It's almost as if the writers were thrilled that they could actually swear on TV and just went a little overboard.Otherwise, a must-see"
3,Less than satisfactory,"I will say that the item came on time but the DVD cases were taped together and some of the discs did not work. The vendor contacted me and while did the great thing of refunding my money also talked to me in a demeaning tone via email blaming it on ""A disgruntled postal worker"" (I work for the postal service)and then basically pushing for me to change my rating and review only after walking me through how to do it as if I was a child who didn't know how too, so here I am. The DVD's that did work were in good condition, they were an old Hollywood video set as seen by the ex rental barcode sticker. The customer service was less than satisfactory but since he (I assume) attempted to make it right, I would buy from these people but I can't guarantee you will be 100% satisfactory. I would rate it a 2 for the actual product and a 3 1/2 for the customer service attempt to make things right."
5,Another Great Show Canceled,I am getting fed up with networks that keep killing great TV. I loved Dead Like Me from the first episode. I waited over a year to see season 2 and didn't even know it was out until the first run was over. I am now watching them rerun on Showtime and will buy the second set soon. I love the characters in this show. Some of the episodes in this season I will admit do seem to rehash previous concepts I still found them interesting and enjoyable to watch. I would love a third season of this show or perhaps a Showtime movie or miniseries at least to answer all the left over questions.
5,"If you like SciFi, dark comedies, you'll Love this",This season is sad just because it was the last. I love this series. It's funny and twisted just because they make light of death and taking souls. Emma Muth is awesome and this whole cast is excellent.
5,An acquired taste,"First of all, don't be misguided by the previous review. Dead Like Me only has 2 seasons. Unfortunately there are no more episodes... and thos of us who got really hooked with this series have no option but to watch again and again this superb series.I can't understand why Dead Like Me was cancelled. There are so few series with that acid humor which won't appeal to everybody, but is certainly so witty, ingenious and unbereably funny that Dead Like Me was instantly one of my favorite series.For other people, Dead Like Me might be an acuqired taste. The point is tat this series was, in my opinion, really original and it should have been given the credit it deserved by giving us more episodes..."
1,Excruciating,"Thinking it might be something like Six Feet Under, I rented the first season of Dead Like Me at my local video store. It was dreadful. I couldn't even get through the pilot episode. The main character is obnoxious, the dialog is strident, and nothing that happens is either funny, moving or interesting. If it got a lot better after the pilot I'll never know. I'm just grateful I only wasted four dollars renting it."
5,i LOVE this show<333,Y did they ever cancel this show? I cant seem to figure this out! I love it! and u have never seen it u better start watching because u will regret it(:
5,dead like me,already had first season was excited to get the seacond. it played well and had no problems with them. will probably buy the two seasons as a gift.
5,batcall,"Someone left HBO, and was responsible for 6 ft. under, went to Showtime, then killed this much funnier. better competition. Dead Like Me should still be on. No regard for the fan base who pay for cable."
4,Better!,It's true. The second season was better then the first! A couple of the episodes were movie quality. All were great.
3,her big brown eyes,"gotta love dolores herbig ""as in her big brown eyes"" very good show. but not near as good as wonderfalls but worth watching. i'm very glad i bought this"
1,Lost Potential,"Easy to see why the network dropped this show, it went from decent to tolerable to intolerable. Maybe a writer with vision can jump-start, but probably won't happen. This finale, was probably the worst episode of the series. If you watch, it will disappoint. Have to wonder who was driving this train, I would fire whoever it was, clearly asleep at the wheel, or stoned...."
4,Excellent Series,"One of the better shows I've seen recently. It's really a shame it is not still running. The DVD extras are pretty weak but, the price is right if you just want to watch the series in order, at your leisure."
5,Dead like me season 2,It is sad that a funny show like this lasted only two seasons. the humor is dry and tends to be dark and sarcastic. simply put it is halarious.
4,Good product as a whole,"Good product as a whole. Noise abatement only for low frequencies. When you listen to music, high frequencies (treble) are poor."
3,"so-so, mediocre, pro-forma, okay, not helpful enough","This book was not *bad* by any means, but that's the limit of my faint praise. Basically, ""dummies"" books are supposed to help us get started in whatever the topic is. It's supposed to get our feet wet, starting in the shallow end of the swimming pool. This book....didn't. It was, in fact, less ""introductory"" than the GURPS books themselves. I wanted a step-by-step, beginner's guide, something that would ease me into the subject. Instead, this book is a ""tricks of the trade"" book, only of any real use to people who are already strongly familiar with the subject. (Also, the authors' note where they said that they had never played any other role-playing-game was terribly ominous. Would you trust an article about cars from someone who only drove Chevys, or an article about nutrition from someone who only eats seafood?)"
1,Etta's Been Done Wrong,"Etta James can do no wrong --- but wrong can be done to her. The mastering of this live set is despicable. It fades the end of every song before each song has finished. When the first song ""ended"", I thought my CD player had died. What th---?!?!! It's a shame because, despite her opening announcement that she's ""feeling under the weather"", Etta really delivers here. Those jarring end fades, though, make you feel like you're listening to a brief sample of each track. Disgusting, and no way to treat a Great Lady --- or her fine band.So, one star for this CD. If the song endings had been included, I'd have given it four."
5,Great Music,"Another one of the older RCA releases, but still in print because of the great collection of tracks. Try it."
5,I collect Jussi Bjorling CDs whenever and wherever I find them.,The latest Jussi Bjorling CD was in perfect condition and played cleanly on both my CD player and in my car.I play my collection of arias when I exercise and during my evening walks.Packaging was well done and arrived on time.AAAAA+++++ seller and music CD.
2,I thought this book was about Feng Shui?,"This book is poorly organized and poorly written. I only made it 135 pages before I couldn't take it anymore. There was too much historical information and not enough practical information. One section about history is fine, but chapters! All I wanted to know was how to place my couch, not who wrote about feng shui 6,000 years ago. Even though it was broken into chapters and sections, it felt very diconnected; with the authors referring constantly to information they would tell you later and to those obscure chinese texts. If you want information on chinese philosophy, religion and the different dynasties then this is your book. But if you are like me and only want to know if your bed should be this way or that than buy another book."
1,Confusing,"I may be an idiot when it comes to Feng Shui but this is still too comlpicated for me! I have gotten other books that have been much more to-the-point than this one.I am an acupuncturist and have studied in China so I have a little bit of an idea about asian culture and how its all works. Unless you are willing to pull out your compass and do a survey on your house and do lots of math- you DON'T want it! It is definately wrongly named. If you are a begginer, don't waste your money. There is better, easier to understand books out there."
5,A wonderful book,The book is simple wonderful. It is the best I have come across in a long time. The explanations are so easy to understand and follow that I would recommend it to all readers who are interested in Feng Shui. It makes a lot of sense and everything is explained in such a fantastic manner that you feel the magic of the Feng Shui after you turn the last page and you realise how much more you have to learn if you want to practise Feng Shui in your life. Thank you Amazon.com for making this book available to the readers around the world.
5,Wonderful Resource!,"You really CAN start from scratch and get a very good understanding of feng shui from this book. It takes you step by step through even the more complicated aspects. It's well-organized, and information is easy to find. I'm very glad to have this book available to me!"
4,Very interesting,"Easily understandable,finding answers to just about any question related to Feng Shui. I found this book helpful in many ways. The book arrived on time and was packaged very well ."
2,Good Basic Info Overwhelmed by Complex Calculations,"While this book does a good job of explaining basic concepts (yin/yang, the cycle of the elements, etc.), its approach has the reader consulting table upon table and performing endless calculations. It's very much a product of the compass school of Feng Shui -- a valid approach, certainly, but hardly one for anyone interested in quick, practical applications. Those who are already familiar with feng shui basics may find this a good bridge to the more complex practices of the compass school ... but beginners will likely be bewildered and put off by the detailed astrological computations, ardent rules and regulations, and complex nature of this book's content."
4,Worthy book!,"This book is the first one that made me realise that the 'eight aspirations' school of feng shui is faux! It does that by providing some information of what is traditional feng shui, and therefore further convinced me that traditional feng shui is not as simple as the designated areas for wealth, health, children etc. Among all the books on feng shui that i've read, this is the only book that gives examples, like the couple searching for a house and the office case study. The only problem i have, is the lack of defining the facing and sitting side of a home, particularly the apartment. Other then that, I had a great time reading this book. Get it folks, it's worth it."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui 3rd Ed is great,The book is very easy to follow. It starts out with basic information and helps the reader follow along as more details are added. I thought it was a very good introduction to understanding Feng Shui.
1,A big disappointment,"Had I known the content of this book, I'd never have bought it. It's more like a badly organized textbook on everything you didn't want to know about Feng Shui than on simple, easy-to-apply principles that ""complete idiots"" can apply to their homes. Too much background information about which I don't care. Too little in the way of immediately useful ideas. What I had hoped for was a sort of Cliff's notes on the topic with a basic Feng Shui to-do list, but what I got was page after page (after page) of theory and tables. If you are looking for an education on Feng Shui and don't care about being able to ferret out any useful ideas, buy this book. Otherwise, keep looking for a Feng Shui book that will actually help you improve your home."
2,Not For Idiots,"To me, an ""Idiot's Guide"" means a basic overview which this book is not! It is very convoluted and disorganized and goes way too much into all areas of Oriental philosophy. While there are a very few interesting areas, this book is way over the top."
2,Beware of this edition!,"I can't believe in that book! I'm from Brazil and practice Ba Zhai and Xuen Kong and bought this book because it has the two schools and I though that was a reference. Surprise! The 8 houses was take off the third edition!!! A new edition is to ADD something else, not to take off. The Amazon don't have the new edition ""look inside"", but the older. I'm very disappointed with this book."
3,pretty good,"Very detailed instructions on how to create a chart and map out your space, but then it almost feels like they ran out of room for how to interpret the charts and remedy the problems...isn't that just as important?"
1,Hard to use,"I made a mistake in buying two complete idiots guide -- one on feng shui and the other on handwriting analysis. What I thought I would get was simple, quick-to-read-, easy-to-APPLY information. What I ended up with in both books is a mishmash of more background information than I ever wanted to know and very, very, very little in the way of helpful ideas to USE. The titles are misleading. More than that, the books seem badly organized. A mess. A waste of money."
4,Feng Shui for Idiots,"Arrived in decent condition, no tears, color markings or food scraps! Price was right and arrival time acceptable.It came from a library, so it was gently loved and well taken care of."
1,Very very disappointing,"Someone should have told me that this was a badly organized textbook on feng shui, NOT the how-to book that I was hoping for. I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here on amazon before I bought this useless book."
1,bullet wounds,"Bottom line seems to be if you're living in a house that isn't situated just right trying to fix it is like putting a ""bandaid on a bullet wound""! If I wasn't discouraged before I am now! Too cute!"
3,Better stuff out there,"Ive had this for several years. If i could sum it up, is an alright video to start off on. Your $35 is spent better elsewhere. I gave it stars as there are not too many DVDs out there on ABA. But i was able to let my therapists and even a school teacher to at least seeing it, applying it was another story. It does give key elements however, getting the attention, keeping attention... object focused play"
3,Heavy and sags,"I had this head for about 8 months. I really liked the oversized knobs and their placement. I had the RC0 Rapid Connect plate because I wanted the leveling bubble.The head is HEAVY and tall - it makes it hard to carry the tripod when it's so off balance. But the biggest problem is the sag. I'd spend a lot of time composing a shot, only to have the camera droop and have to start over. I tried and tried to come up with a way to compensate for the sag, but every time it sagged, it sagged a slightly different amount. I tried loosening the lock a lot, I tried keeping pressure on, and no matter what I did, the camera would sag after I ""locked"" it in place. Eventually, I sold the head and bought a Really Right Stuff BH-40. It is A LOT shorter and lighter, and there's NO SAG! I don't think I have a piece of photo equipment that I'm happier with than the RRS head."
2,Returned.,Return was easily accomplished. A little more wear and tear than I expected with lees than smooth ball movement noted.
5,This is one Excellent tripod head.,This tripod head is a real pleasure to use. It puts a smile on my face whenever I use it. I have an older tripod with a pan tilt head and the Manfrotto ball head is just so nice to use in comparison. If you purchase one of these you will not be disappointed with it at all. And if you ever want to sell it there will be lots of people wanting to buy it off of you. That's nice to know. But I am sure you will get years of service from this piece of equipment. Enjoy!!
5,Great Ball-Head but a little too big for use with a Super Clamp,This thing is a beast! It will easily support almost anything you put on it. I purchased it for use with a Super Clamp but together they weigh so much I have to be careful to attach it to something very sturdy. It is very well made and should last for years to come.
4,Very good head for the price,"I'd honestly have preferred the equivalent head from Really Right Stuff, but I simply can't afford theirs. In this price range, however, the 488RC2 is an excellent head. The only thing I'd have liked would be if they'd included a spirit level. Otherwise this is a great buy."
4,Good Value for the Money,"This ball-head lives up to the Manfrotto name. It holds my Nikon D60 with a 70-300mm Nikkor lens securely. The reason I give it four stars is that when using the 300mm lens, if I set the camera and tighten the ball, the lens droops just a bit. This might be me failing to tightening the ball sufficiently but it doesn't happen with lighter, shorter lenses. It's also a drag that this head doesn't have a spirit level, but I knew that when I bought it.I'd purchase it again."
4,Well made and solid.,Very pleased with my purchase. Needed to get by as inexpensively as possible so I purchased a no-name carbon tripod and this Bogen head and they seem like a good combination. I'm a very occasional user but this holds my Canon 10D with battery grip and a Sigma 50-500mm lens with out difficulty. I'm satisfied.
2,Too unwieldy,"I thought that choosing where to set the tripod head (horizontal, vertical and tilt) all at one time would be a good but it isn't for me. Just as I would set the horizontal, then lossen it to set the vertical, I'd lose the horizonal position. Totally exasperating. So I sent it back to get the 3-way head so I can set one direction at a time."
4,Great companion to book.,This dvd helps drummers round out their catalogue of grooves to help get you more and different kinds of gigs.
4,dissecting both sides,"Who could have imagined in the depths of the Cold War that one day it would be over, and Americans and Russians might debate how it began in a book like this one? As the 20th century slowly passes into history, the book is timely. Containing analysis of important surviving persons and actions in that war. Aided by the ending of the war and the freer exchange of ideas and historical documents.The book allows for a dispassionate dissection of the perceptions and actions of both sides. You can clearly see what we now know to be misperceptions, and how these were acted on."
3,Practical prototype,"3 1/2Although the group's synergy was still to pick up, Zorn's varying arrangement types were starting to bear fruit."
4,Pretty Sweet Deal,"There's obviously a lot of confusion about what's going on with the price here. While $5.00 for a 12 pack of Pepsi might seem a little high everyone here is discounting the fact that this 12 pack is delivered directly to your door. And that shipping is FREE if you have Amazon Prime. So once you factor in gas money, time spent away from the television and opportunity cost, it's a pretty sweet deal. That aside, I love Pepsi because it makes me want to dress up in women's clothes and shave off all my body hair. Plus Pepsi is a natural antioxidant (Coke and RC are not) so there are numerous health benefits from drinking it. FYI, I did the math here several times and the price comes down to between 2.5 and 9.0 cents per ounce. Kind of a steal if you ask me."
1,Don't Support Pepsi!,"The Pepsi company contributed $2,485,400 to defeat the California Prop 37 also known as ""The California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act."". Do you really want to buy from a company that does not want you to know that GMO is in your food?"
2,At least it's not RC,"Seriously, this stuff just doesn't taste as good as Coke. I rue the day that Quiznos switched from Coke to Pepsi."
5,A Great Recording of Aida,"This is one of my favorite recordings of Aida. FIrst of all if you're looking for a recording of this title you simply must have one with Leontyne Price in the title role, no one else can match her in this role. The names Aida and Leontyne Price are synomonous. Domingo is also a great Radames and he has truly been the verdian tenor of our times. Bumbry is also such a dynamic voice and sings Amneris like no one else. My favorite moment in the opera is durnig the duet ""pur ti riveggo"", when Price sings "" In van tu no potressti"" She is so great. Buy this recording I did and I am incredibly happy with it!!!"
1,So Disappointing .....................,"I fell in love with this toaster the minute I saw it. Even though my current toaster works beautifully I purchased this one to replace it. I loved the whole look of it. Luckily I decided to try this one out before I gave away my current toaster and before I got rid of the packaging. I set the toaster on 3 which is about your normal setting on any toaster. The toast came out white, the bread was partially toasted, but it didn't have any color.Not appealing. I than put in another slice and set the setting to four. I had a piece of charcoal when it popped up.I tried to do a setting in between three and four not possible with this model.I than boxed it up and returned it."
3,Looks good,"Although the retro look of this toaster looks good in my kitchen, it doesn't always function as expected. The lever doesn't always come all the way up when the toast is done. This morning it seemed to take a long time till I noticed it wasn't toasting. I hadn't pushed the lever down hard enough. I don't know why it has separate settings for toast, bagel and pastry. It also has a cancel, defrost and reheat button. Maybe if it didn't have so many functions, it would be a better toaster."
3,Stylish! works okay,"I love the look of this toaster. But, it works okay. I have to force my favorite Orowheat bread into the slot due to the length of the opening. The coils don't go very far up so, I can't just turn it the other way."
4,this little toaster does the job,i have been using this toaster for the last month and a half. though im not a daily toast maker it deffinitly comes through. the handles feel a little flimsy but the toaster performs and makes toast perfectly im very happy with it and its retro look
1,"Looks great, but broke quickly","I bought this after the many glowing reviews, but after a month, the toaster wouldn't heat for more than 30 seconds at a time, and that was at the darkest setting. I have to keep pressing it down to heat over and over. This is one toaster I wish I had never bought, nor would I want any of my friends to get it."
4,Overall excellent performance with customizable settings,"Of the years I've used this product, it has performed without problem. The highest setting for toast, bagel or pastry seems pointless to me, but if you like burnt crisp, there is that option. It's a good toaster. If you like the options to use the adjustment knobs for burning or for barely heating your bread, you have those options with this. The four star rating for this piece is because of the size. It is large. If you see the measurements and care to save space in your kitchen, you might want to check out how bulky this item is. I like the classic shine of the exterior a lot, and the shape as well--both qualities swaying me to buy this. That said, the bulk is unnecessary. A streamlined product in this same concept would be five stars."
2,Meh,"I thought I would like this toaster since I've had good luck in the past with Sunbeam products. But it's a big disappointment. From Day One, it doesn't eject toast, bagels, pop tarts or anything else I put into it---I have to manually eject everything. It doesn't come on reliably, either. The light will come on but after a few minutes when I start to get my toast or whatever out, it hasn't browned at all & I discover that the heating elements never came on. It's also very difficult to get it to stay down to toast anything. No matter what the lightness or darkness is set at, I usually have to push the bar thingy down several times before it will catch & stay. I don't use it that often & would not recommend it to someone who uses a toaster on a daily basis as they would probably end up throwing it out a window."
2,Cute but not worth it,"I bought this toaster because the style would look good in my kitchen. I liked the little light on the front of the toaster and the curved shape. I liked the old-fashioned fun look. Lesson learned: do not buy a toaster based solely on ""The Look"".Function - Pretty bad actually. It does not toast both sides of the bread - and I have tried it every which way to see if I could get it to work properly. I have to put the bread in, toast one side, then turn it to get the other side. Very time-consuming and annoying plus it's not the most rapid toasting product anyway. Would not buy again and cannot recommend - there are other toasters out there that would do a better job and still suit your kitchen's design."
2,Not worth the money,"If you want it to look shiny on the counter, great. If you want quality toasting, not so much. Controls are not as good as cheaper models. The outside gets hot. The products being toasted do not pop back out as expected"
3,Cute as a Button but Not as Precise,So far I'm still looking for just the right setting. I'm confident that I will find it. I wish the toast popped up all the way. This is not a really great toaster but it is adequate and I love it's look. Its fine for the price.
2,Had to Return,"This product looks cute but ours toasted unevenly. There were a lot of settings, but it seemed to only toast to burnt or underdone--no in between. Also, one side of the bread toasted darker than the other. We returned the toaster. After returning another toaster from Target, we finally found the Cuisinart CPT-160 at Lowe's and it meets our need - which is toasting a piece of bread or bagel without any problems. It also has a nice look."
1,"Buy this ONLY for decorative purposes, NOT toasting anything",Pass on this unless you want to decorate your kitchen.. I got 2 ( original and replacement) neither of which worked.....Major waste of time and money.... so very sad!
5,Sunbeam Heritage toaster,"I love this toaster. I bought a rather expensive Kitchenaid 2 slot toaster 1 year ago, and after several unhappy months of getting either burnt toast or not toasted at all, I started to look for another one. I liked the clean look of this retro toaster. I took a chance and have been so happy!! It taosted perfgectly according to setting and has a removeable crumb tray that slides out easily!Would highly reccomend it!!"
4,good toaster,"I like how my toaster looks, it really does look like the older models.Does it make perfect toast? Maybe not, but good enough. If you want a cutetoaster and you're not a toast snob, you will like it."
3,Sunbeam Art Deco Toaster,"I have two of the 1939 original Sunbeam T-9 Toasters along with this new one. While it looks the same, the basic toasting is not. The slots are too small for most breads, the toast does not come up when finished and getting the controls to be predictable is impossible. On the plus side, it does accommodate bagels. It takes at least twice as long to toast anything than it does in the original 1939 Sunbeam toaster. Okay toaster, but should be a lot better."
5,Bought as a gift,"I bought this for my Mom for a Birthday gift, she loved it and said it works great."
2,Retro Look... Non Retro Workmanship,"Loved the look of the Sunbeam 3916 Heritage, and the extra wide slots that were wide enough for half a bagel.However... whereas our original toaster that was made around year 1955 had lasted more than 50 years before finally breaking down (handed down over two generations, and with heavy family use)... this cheaply made modern version from Sunbeam lasted about three years. The sliding switches are extremely frail.What broke first: the mode (toast, bagel, etc.) slider; although we never discerned any real difference in any of these modes anyway.What broke next: the light/dark toast slider.What broke last, and finally rendered the toaster unusable: the spring loaded toast lever (that lowers the bread into the toaster).Cute toaster, but would never purchase another Sunbeam... ever. Cheaply made, poor mechanical design."
1,Looks cute but doesn't stand the test of time,"I bought this toaster in July 08. It isn't of the finest quality I would have expected for the cost, but kept it because it was cute and worked. Three weeks ago the lever to choose darkness of the toast stopped working. Last week the lever to hold the bread down stopped working. I am unable to use this toaster at all. I have contacted Sunbeam to see if they can fix or replace, but I am not hopefull."
2,Needs improvement,"I wanted to replace my 10 year old toaster which still worked with one that was more sleek and this retro stainless toaster caught my eye. It reminded me of one from my childhood.I have not found this toaster to toast consistently each time. I also miss a feature which eables me to raise the toasted item further up from the slot after toasting is complete. The top of the toaster also gets extremely hot, however the sides do not. A deeper crumb tray would be an improvement.I held on to my old toaster, just in case...."
1,"Flimsy construction, does not toast evenly","Two big complaints about this product and one about Amazon.One, this is really a flimsy piece of ""Made in China"" product. I think it's probably the worst example of such I've had the misfortune to come across. If I had seen this in person I never would have purchased it.Two, it does not work very well. I have yet to get it to toast a piece of bread evenly.But three, what really angered me was that less then 24 hours after I purchased it, I went online and Amazon had lowered the price on the toaster substantially. Although I see today that it is back at the price I paid for it.That really frosted the deal.One of my most disappointing buying experiences on Amazon."
3,not the best,"I got this toaster for my sister for Christmas,because that was all she talked about was how great the toast was from the Sunbeam toaster. Apparently that was the old style. Now we have a problem getting the toast just right for her. It's either too light or too dark. She told me the other day she tried it on 3 which was too light and on 4 which was too dark. Its hard to find enough room to get a 3 1/2. I'm sure I could have found another brand cheaper that toasts better. I'd never spend that much on a toaster again."
1,Why did I rent this,"Gwyneth PAltrow is a truly, truly awful thing. Insipid, can't act, awful. Aside from that this is borderline adequate. It definitely is a Hollywood version, with much of the cleverness and wit lost and some dialogue inserted that is jarringly out of touch with Austen's style of writing. This is a fast food, junk version for mass appeal and a shameful mass when considering what it was based on... It is a deformed. warped, dumbed down version of something good that will enjoy popularity because it stars a flavor of the month girl as the main actress. Sometimes I have no hope for us."
1,Poor Quality Cover,"When I bought this cover, I thought it would be as rough and tumble as what the G.I.'s get. I was 100% wrong. I took my canteen and cover on a camping trip this summer thinking it was a great idea for hiking. But I was wrong. I bought 3 of these for three canteens, and they all had the same problems. The cover rips when you try to pull a snap open. The Velcro pocket won't stay shut (I lost 2 bottles of Iodine Tablets that way). Also, the accompanied military style belt clips are so stiff that you need another person to help you put it on. Then it falls off! The stiff clips will easily pop off. I suggest you just get a caribener clip and a BPA free Nalgene Bottle. Don't waste your time with this."
5,Fabulous,The book arrived quickly & in perfect condition. I've shared it with 80+ year old veterans & 20 something artists - everyone loves this piece of history. Thx Peg
2,valuable insight,My father and his siblings were here during the depression. It's nice to see a synopsis.
3,Hodge Podge of a Book,"Theroux gives us a literary delicatessen of vignettes and experiences from his writings and from personal experiences. Some of the chapters are great, some exceedingly boring. Every journalist has pieces of stories and experiences which, in themselves, would not constitute books, so they look for ways to package them in a saleable fashion. This is what Theroux has done here. This book seems to be less about his travels than about his opinions on a wide range of subjects. On the other hand, we learn a lot about this able and prolific author and how he thinks. It was a worthwhile read, but I did a lot of chapter skipping."
2,It's true - not the usual Theroux,"Theroux reveals himself to be just as grouchy, crabby, mean spirited, etc. as the rest of us. Especially hard to get through the first few chapters. Gets a little better. Some flashes of the travel writer we love. Many other travel books around which are more entertaining."
1,Quite Depressing,"I love the ""Home Repair is Homicide"" series.. But I feel like they just keep getting more, and more depressing as the series continues.. It seems Jake loses touch with her son, and often becomes irrational and depressed. Not to mention what un-Godly business happens to Victor in this book.. I was in denial the entire time after I read the beginnings of his deal.. I was quite depressed and wanted badly to cry when I read the final words in this book.. I can't even begin to explain how terribly sad it was.. Especially if you're a big fan of this series and the characters.. After this installment it will never be the same.."
3,maybe it was my mood--for four days,"i've been reading the series since the first book, and have enjoyed them all, if to varying degrees. but this one...i had a lot of trouble getting into it.i found jake's behavior irrational and self-destructive, not to mention somewhat stupid; i thought that several of the issues were included because they're currently popular, not because they were integral to the story; other plot developments were cliched; the reactions of some of the characters were beyond belief; the story didn't flow as well as usual and a lot of the writing seemed forced; and i skimmed the last pages just to get done with the book.the cover art was nice."
4,"Best of the ""Home Repair Is Homicide"" series","As the ninth book in this series, it's also the strongest. Graves' story is not filled with too many characters or too many plotlines. It's a compelling, fast-paced story with personal tragedy for Jacobia ""Jake"" Tiptree.Jake and her best friend, Ellie, have rented a small house to a ""coven of witches."" Within the month, a man is found murdered in their shed, drugs are discovered, and a teenage girl goes missing. Jake's own past pushes her to search for the girl, despite personal danger. It also pushes her to ignore the personal issues with her ex-husband.As Jake hurtles towards danger and disaster, the reader rushes along in this suspenseful story."
3,Not quite up to par.,"Another novel where the cover blurb didn't line up with the story.The biggest one is in the opening line: ""Jacobia 'Jake' Tiptree took the dangerous plunge from Wall Street power broker–to homeowner! Now the do-it-yourself enthusiast is about to discover that her own dream house is built on a foundation of murder."" Nowhere in the book does this happen at all.The dead man Jake discovers is known throughout the town as a street preacher of the fire-and-brimstone school, yet none investigating his death thinks to look into this aspect of his life as a motive for his murder, especially since hew was murdered in a home occupied by a group of 'wannabe' witches.The ending, too, had a bit of Deus ex Machina ending in that the guilty party was suddenly revealed with no clue or hint earlier that this person might be the killer.All in all, a very lame entry into what so far has been a very enjoyable series."
2,More problems than a mystery,I have been trying to get into this series and have thur far failed miserably. The characters have so many problems that I find myself questioning whether I am listening (on CD) to a mystery at all.The ending came up fast and hard which would have been ok except that the rest of the book lacked the attention getter plot I have been used to in other cozies. I may continue trying this series but I don't have high hopes. Sad face.Also I've read/listened to a few others in this series and did not review them at all.
2,"""Twiddle Your Thumbs"" would have been a better title","Jacobia and Ellie hope to ""flip"" a derelict house and make some money in real estate but first they rent the property for two weeks to a group studying the ""dark arts."" A storm, a murdered body, a drug dealer, missing pills, a kidnapping, a mysterious box, would-be witches, a con man, a heart attack, a brain tumor, a couple of scenes of pointless mayhem, another storm and a Made-for-TV bang-bang finish. Sounds pretty exciting, huh? Well, maybe it is the laid-back demeanor of the down-east Maine persona but the truth is this is pretty boring. I have not read the other books in the series, and I do not intend to."
2,Too slow and not a thriller.,I just didn't like this book. It was too slow. not thrilling and not a mystery.
5,Just what the author's title implied...,"I really enjoyed this book! It was fast moving, well written and a ""nail biter"". I would recommend this to anyone for a very good read."
2,Too Slow,"I am 2/3 of the way through this book, and I'm considering not finishing it, which would be very out of character for me. The story is too slow, and the mystery isn't interesting. Jacobia is not only brave, she's fool-hardy and occasionally endangers her life needlessly. Soon after starting the book, I realized I had read another book of the series, but I can't remember much about it, which means I must not have liked that one much either. The characters in the book don't ring true; I'm particularly wondering why her husband Wade takes her life-endangering escapades so calmly. I'm not saying he should prohibit her behavior, (she's an independent woman, after all) but he seems a bit too laid back to be real. Note: I was surprised other reviewers mentioned something happening to Victor without a ""spoiler alert"" tag."
3,I've seen better fanfiction stories,"i was extremely disappointed by this book. The story jumped around too much and made so little sense that it was too hard to even try to follow. the ending was equally disappointing, seeing as it was unexpected, but not in a good way. however, the series rocks, so i had to give it 3 stars just for the name."
3,A TRIP BACK IN TIME TO THE LATE 80'S AND EARLY 90'S,"I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF QUEEN LATIFAH.BUT I WAS AT THE STORE FLIPPING THROUGH CD'S AND FOUND THIS ONE.AND IT WAS COOL TO HEAR HOW RAP WAS IN THE LATE 80'S AND EARLY 90'S.AND YOU CAN TELL THAT RAP HAS MADE A 360 TURN SINCE 1990.BUT IT IS STILL COOL TO GO BACK IN TIME AND HEAR THING'S.THAT WILL NEVER BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO OR THE VIDEO CHANNEL'S EVER AGAIN.(AND THAT IS A SHAME).I THINK EVERY ONE SHOULD PICK UP THIS CD.IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF RAP YOU WILL GIVE THE OLD SCHOOL A CHANCE.AND NOT JUST LISTEN TO THE RAP OF 2000 AND BEYOND.AND QUEEN LATIFAH IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ARTIST WHO STARTED THIS FEMALE RAP GAME.AND PAVED THE WAY FOR PEOPLE LIKE EVE AND DA BRAT.AND JUST MAYBE YOU WILL BECOME A FAN OF SOMEONE THAT NEVER CROSSED YOUR MIND LIKE I DID.QUEEN LATIFAH CAN RAP AND ACT.I JUST HOPE SHE KEEP'S DOING BOTH!{TONY~TONI~TON`E)-ROME,NEW YORK"
4,Wonderful book for the self-taught,"The illustrations and pictures showing the position of the hands and feet are VERY useful to those self-teaching. Far more so than most books and videos on this subject. However, over and over I found that reference to the words and meaning of the introduction was essential to the learning process and answered issues such as breathing and martial arts potential of the exercise"
2,Digimortal,"You know, Fear Factory used to be my favorite band... until this album. it's really sad how some bands sell out and become weak just to make money, isn't it? I had very high expectations when I bought it, but when I actually started playing it for the first time, I took it out of my CD player and replaced it with Demanufacture. let me say this: if you're into the rap-rock genre like Limp Bizkit or Korn or anything like that, by all means, buy this album. if you actually like GOOD music, on the other hand, such as earlier FF, Death Metal, and Black Metal, buy something else. If they keep going in this direction, they will lose all of the fans that put them where they are."
2,This is not death metal Amazon,"The strange thing is (...) places this ablum in the Death Metal. Do not allow this to fool those of you who haven't bought this album. It sounds more along the lines of (...) metal. Sorry for the language... there isn't any other way of saying it. The guitarist sounds like he got trashed the night before and the lyrics (stink). But, besides that it sounds great to an extent. Only 3, 4 songs sounds good to me. If you're wondering if you could spend 15 bucks... don't. Buy something like their older albums, Sepultura (not Nation), Gwar or anything. Just save your money for a better album, please."
4,Decent Follow Up To A Classic Album,"I think that most Fear Factory fans would consider ""Obsolete"" their best album. I definitely agree with that. ""Digimortal"" was their follow up to that classic album and its pretty good but cannot live up to its predecessor. If you have to choose between ""Obsolete"" and ""Digimortal"", then you should definitely buy ""Obsolete"". The music on this album contains four really good tracks while the rest kind of chug along but aren't too memorable. The extra tracks aren't really worth paying the extra price for the album. Its pretty obvious why they did not make the ""official"" album. My favorite tracks are:What Will Become?DamagedByte BlockHurt Conveyor"
3,Weak effort,"This isn't a bad cd but it's definitely not a good one. They put out a great album with Obsolete but they apparently ran out of good material because there isn't more than 5 good songs on this album. These guys have watched the Terminator movies a few too many times and the whole ""man is being replaced by machines"" theme is getting old. Does every new ""metal band"" have to use 7 string guitars to sound heavy? Black Sabbath and Judas Priest never did and they are still heavier than these new bands. Long live metal (but quit the trends)!"
3,a step back????,"While I do not hate this album i would say that it does not touch fear factory's hard edged, fist pumping, headbanging second album Obsolete. A decent follow up, but not what i was expecting."
1,A Sell Out Album?! The humanity!,"First, Amazon is wrong go back to the Death Metal list because this NOT death metal. If you want a great album from Fear Factory get ""Soul of a New Machine"" or ""Demanufacture"". I'm a Fear Factory fan. I have their albums up until now. I couldn't believe this album when I heard it! It's like Backstreet Boys going into Metal. Yeah, that's how horrible this album is! It has the sound of the old Fear Factory singing but, it has a sound of being slower and more whiny, which is how 90% of bands are sounding than they did back in the 80s (not 80s music, 80s metal). If anyone is a Metal fan knows that Metal is not whiny it's like ""I'll kill you"" then apologizes about it later. Anyway, the bottom line: skip over this album do not support sell outs in any form (Metallica). Buy later albums like ""Soul of a New Machine"" or ""Demanufacture"" but not his one."
4,Almost Living Up to Obsolete,AS much of a great album as Digimortal is and as much as they have kept their same sound which obiously has worked for them since 1992.... none of their albums has lived up to the awsome powerr of Obsolete... this is great album where everything said in all the other reviews is true but if your a new comer to Fear Factory first get Obsolete and then collect the rest starting with Digimortal....
3,Digimortal,"I'm not sure I totally agree with some reviews posted. Butnevertheless I can understand some of it. My problems withthis release are kinda maturity issue that bands likethis face as they pass the 10 year mark. Digimortal simplypicks up where Obsolete left off. Which for what is was wortha decent release with some power groove influences that work. Ilike the low tuned guitars, the drumming is what you've come toexpect from Raymond. Burton seems to be using more vocal harmonies as time grows. At times Burton sounds more like a more polished and radio friendly version of Justin Broadrick(Godflesh). I do think a good half of this cd is cool while otherhalf is pop cultured mediocre version of it's former self."
2,the album which nearly destroyed fear factory,"OK,Fear Factory are a phenomenal band. They showed this with such titles as 'soul of a new machine','demanufacture','obsolete' and their new release 'archetype'...but this one? What were they thinking? This album isn't anywhere near as heavy as any of their other releases. The riffs are too simple. Sure, the vocals still have an aggressive edge to them, but it just ain't trademark Fear Factory. 'Linchpin' is a good song however,but 'back the f*** up'...a rap song with the guy outta cypress hill...uhh? This shows that FF were going into a papa roach nu metal phase when this album came out. Fortunately, their new release blows this one away!"
3,Not as good as Obsolete,"Fear Factory's new c.d. Digimortal in ways to me was a disapointment. It seems to lack in comparison to Obsolete and now I'll tell you why. Most of the tracks sound like the same guitar and drums rehashed over and over to make an album I think should of had a little more time and effort put into it. Some of the tracks stick out as realy good,(like What Will Become?). And then there's the track that doesn't even belong on the c.d. ""Back the f**k up"" featuring Bee Reel from Cypres Hill,I mean Fear Factory with a guest rapper it doesn't work for me at all,and I think it was a sad attempt to fit in w/this rap rock crap that's plauging the air waves(except Linkin Park and Papa Roach). So Fear Factory makes a decent follow album that shows promise for the next one,so Fear Factory please evolve just a little."
2,Another great band falls victim to a trend,"I have been faithfully listening to Fear Factory for about six years now, but I can say this is the last Fear Factory cd I buy. It lacks the heaviness and all out assault of Soul of a New Machine, and the good songs of Demanufacture. I personally liked Obsolete. Plain and simple, Digimortal is absolutely trendy. They now sound like every other new band that it out there. Why buy this album when it sounds like every other nu metal band thats out there. Every sound on the album is predictable, from the bland syncopated riffs to the horrible, hip hop style squeals. The album sounds as if was written in a week. They have stooped low to add a rap song on thier album. I have loved FF and I like Cypress Hill, but why be like the 50,000 other bands that are mixing the two. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the tight production and Dino's guitar tone."
4,review of the songs,"1.What will becom?- A classic FF song, one of the best on this cd. 5/52.Damaged- Another timeless ff song. One of my favrorites. 5/53.Digimortal-kind of sound like linchpin. But the turn tables kind of take away. 4/54.No One- My 2nd favorite on this cd. has Christian screaming ""Take one, Take One more shot"" in the middle, and honestly he screams just as good as Burt. 5/55.Linchpin- The hit single on the cd. OK song. 4.5/56.Invisible Wounds(dark Bodies)- The most melodic song on the cd.My favorite on the cd. 5/57.Acres of Skin-A song thats dating back to demanufacture. And That was thier best cd. (At least to everyone else)-5/58.Back the F*ck up-has b-real from cypress hill on this song. not ff best. too much rap flavor. 2.5/59.Byte Block-Dating back to demanufacture. Good song. 4.5/510. Hurt Conveyor- A very good song also like Byte Block and acres of skin. 5/511.(Memory Imprints)Never End-A horrible song. 5 times more keyboards than guitar. EXTREMLY industrial. 1.5/5"
4,this is definitely fear factory's best,"this is some awesome sh!t. any big fans of fear factory will enjoy this album. it has the same style that has made fear factory unique over the years taking a touch of all their other sh!t ad combining the styles into one truly spectacular album. ""digimortal"", ""dark bodies"", and ""linchpin"" are amazing and everything else is very good too."
2,Ahh what happend!!!,Man was I dissapointed when i heard this. I was waiting for another Soul of a new machine but man they really killed it. Were are all thoughs Napalm Deah and Godflesh influnces. Some of the instrumental work on here is good but it sounds radio friendly. I really wish they would of made their last cd a good one. At least they released Concrete which is just full on death metal. I heard Dino was in a different band I wonder what they sound like? I hope like the old FF. Well anyways this was a very dissapoint album and I would not recomend it to the old FF fans.
2,not original,"The vocals are weak, and nothing else in this cd is exceptional. Get any of their previous stuff if you want something real good."
4,"A little more mellow, but stilll incredible","First off, let me just say that Fear Factory's ""Digimortal"" has not left my car's cd player the entire time I have owned it. It's just that good. Ok, got it out of the way.It's not as heavy as Soul Of A New Machine or Demanufacture, sure. But, I don't think Burton and the Boys have lost anything with the new record at ALL. Tracks 1, 3, and 5 really stand out as memorable, Raymond Hererra still plays with almost maniacal intensity, and B-Real does an admirable job on Back the **** Up. In fact, the only reason I give this album 4 stars is because I liked Demanufacture just that little bit more.In conclusion, this album ROCKS, and any fans of Demanufacture and\or Obsolete will have no reason to regret the purchase of Digimortal. Out."
2,What happened to fear factory,"As a long time fan of fear factory I was anticipating this release very much. Man, was I dissapointed.If your a fan of old fear factory dont bother with this album.Im not against bands changing their sound or progressing but I think fear factory tried to cash in on the insound right now and failed miserably. Iwant my old fear factory back."
5,CZ Bow Pendant with Pearl Drop,Such an elegant piece! I order a few of these for my bridesmaids and they adored them. Great product at a low price!
1,I agree,"I agree. I really wanted my wedding to be special, but this vendor needs to be more specific with her merchandise. The ""Vera Wang"" necklace, which I purchased was soooo disapointing! The pendant was way too small as well as the chain. It was terrible. I strongly recommend not to burchase from them."
2,Don't get this just to match the earrings,"I ended up returning this necklace. The pearl wasn't that pretty. It didn't match the earrings I had gotten to go with this necklace (they're from the same company). It was a weird shape, neither oval or round. The chain was really cheesy looking. The only reason I gave this necklace any stars was for the bow. Other than that, I didn't like anything else about this necklace."
2,i guess this book would really be great for the younger kids,"this book i would like to suggest to you7nger kids around 38 because it does not use too big of words, and it will capture a kids heart."
5,Great Shaker,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a pricy piece - you can get cheaper ones on Amazon for less than $10. But it is worth it! The construction is better than any metal shaker I have seen, and I have not had the problem with the lids sticking that others have had. I found it is not necessary to attach the lids tightly to prevent leaking, light pressure when closing it works well every time. It pours well and is easy to clean."
3,Lovely but Flawed,"The look of the shaker is quite nice, and it doesn't leak, but every time one or both of the lids gets stuck and I can't get them apart."
3,Website needs better description of product,"According to the product description, this Rosle shaker is a ""3 component design"". OK: you have the tumbler and you have the lid. That's one and two. What's the third? Also, China is notorious for its cheap and inferior steel. Guess where this $60+ brushed steel shaker is made? Yup...CHINA!"
5,Worth every penny!,"If you want EFFICEINT professional ballhead. Look no further. This ballhead is considered the entry level professional ballhead. If you have an slr or a dslr even with a big lens, this ballhead suffices. I sure am amazed at its quality and peformance. No need to spend more money unless you use MF equipment.The +90/-90 tilt is such a welcome feature -fast and easy.The tightning machanism feels sure and takes little effort to tighten and untighten.FidelSan Antonio"
3,"Nice ballhead, does the job, room for improvement.","I like this nice, not cheap but affordable, ballhead! It does the job, I like the quick-release plate (fits perfectly my BG-E4 battery grip) and the 2 level spirits! However, the design of the locking knob sucks big time: it's sort of wrapped into an independent rubber ring that turns on the axis when locking it. I do not trust it's gonna be reliable on the long term. Same story for the self-lubricating system. Other than this, it's a great product--I recommend it."
5,Simply Excellent!,"Quality product. I have been a fan of the ""Walmart"" variety tripods until now. This head is bigger than I expected and not in a bad way. You get what you pay for. Tight and solid where it needs to be yet easy to adjust. I could not be happier."
5,Love it,"This is a great piece. I am using it with a Cannon T1i and the 18-55/55-250 kit lenses. This thing is quite formidable - I can set it on the table (sans tripod) with camera attached and it does not move. It has great balance, feel, and features. Some say that the RC4 system is a little large for a smaller body like the T1i, but I think the double bubbles are superb. I have yet to figure out how to store the auxillary 3/8 screw in the plate as the euro-english translated owners manual states, but not a big deal."
4,Manfrotto 488RC4,I have found this to be a well constructed and user friendly item.It is the first ball head that I have purchased and my only gripe is that the QR locking plate and camera plate are too large for my likeing.I have recently replaced them with a midsized QR plate system from Really Right Stuff.Over all I am quite satisfied with the 488 ball head and would recommend to anyone shopping in this price range. It is smoothe and solid. I use it with D300 and D70S Nikons.
3,Used for almost under a year - dissappointed,I purchased and have been utilizing this weekly for almost under a year.Pro -Here's what I've found - it's been sturdy enough to support my 70-200 2.8BIG CON -After some long-term use - the SECONDARY safety catch + the lever to release the plates gets stuck or becomes quite a chore to get out at times.
5,Piano Sonata/Little Suite/American Ballads,"An amazing collection of Roy Harris compositions played brilliantly by Johana Harris, his wife. Ms Harris has a sensitivity, insight and musicality that is unequaled. She has done other CDs on Bach and Debussy and I urge you to also consider buying these. This kind of playing comes along only once in a lifetime."
3,printer paper,The paper was just as order'd.the shipping makes this item extremely high priced. I suggest you buy local if possible.
3,A Little Like a Slasher Flick,"Seriously, that's what this book reminded me of as Yossi blundered around like the dumb blonde in a Friday the 13th sequel that insists on wandering into the basement with nothing but a single match for light while the audience shrieks ""NO NO NO!!!!""The other aspect that stumped me was the inexplicable contrast between Yossi's wide-eyed ingenue personae and his callous treatment of his friend. The Israelis I met during my rambles were by and large a fairly guarded, cynical lot (with good reason). But, after all, Yossi's misadventure was pre-Intifada, and by his own description he's lived longer outside of Israel than in it.One thing is certain: this is an honest, unvarnished look into the most admirable and petty facets of the human psyche. NOBODY would make up a story about accidentally sodomizing himself with a tree branch while sliding down a hill."
3,"a diary, not a book","It is a lucky story of survival but that's it. Probably not unique - many people who are completely ignorant to the wild life are attracted to it and then find themselves helpless. ""into the wild"" book had a sad ending, this one has a better one. However, the author is obviously not a writer (nor does he claim to be). It is basically a published diary. There is very little description of the settings as he ""travels"" through the jungle. I had to actively remind myself to picture the jungle."
5,A compelling true story of survival,Yossi has the ability to inspire in a way that is rarely experienced through his brilliant story telling. It is a story of human courage about a man who finds himself totally lost and alone in a formidable jungle. Yossi's fate in staying alive in so many death defying instances in inhospitable surroundings is truly remarkable. The determination of his truehearted friend who never gave up made it possible for him to tell the story!This extraordinary book is a worthy gift for friends and family.
1,Don't Waste Your Time.,"If you want to read a true survival story: read Steven Callahan's ""Adrift"". I really disliked Yossi and his story. He's alive, not because of courage or any innate skills he possesses, but because of dumb luck. I didn't want to put his book down because I wanted to be done with it. As much as he tries to disguise it, Yossi is a jerk. He's pompous, reckless, and whiney. I don't think he learned anything from his experience, and he's not a good writer. There's no insight here. Save yourself some time, and skip this book."
4,A Good Read,"I found the book to be interesting.It is not a ""story"" nor a tale.It is an account of someone's near demise."
3,"Dumb, yes, but entertaining","This book gets a 3 on quality, but a 5 on easy read. It makes great airplane reading, or other times when you don't have quiet chunks of time for deeper reading.The main character of this story is a bit of a dope, and it is hard to feel sorry for him at times. He comes off as a bit hard-hearted, and he makes some crazy mistakes and decisions (I would probably make them too, though!).Compared to some of the better true-life adventure books out there, I was not impressed. Still, the story had some educational merit. It might keep me from wandering around in the Amazon."
3,Good story lacking insights and spirituality,"I bought and read this book because of the author's appearance on a television interview. His story on TV was interesting to me because of his self-discovery and personal growth. However, the book was an account of his ""adventure"" only. Interesting story, but not ""full"" enough.Christian DimasSan Luis Obispo CA"
3,"Good, but much better books out there","If you like adventure, there are better books out there ""As far as my feet will carry me"" and ""skeletons on the sahara"". The author was lost in the jungle for a few weeks. compared to other stories, his seems like a walk in the park."
2,If You''ve Already Read Everything Else,"This book isn't bad, but it isn't good either as you can probably tell from my giving it only two stars. The book was interesting and entertaining as far as survival stories go but what bothered me was that it wasn't particularly well written. I think the author would have benefitted from a professional writer penning the book instead of he.I was bored with about the first 100 pages of the book. I kept wondering when it was going to become interesting but it just ran on and on. I didn't really care about the history fo all the players, a few pages of setup would have been enough. I mean really, do we need to be told that they have no idea of what lies ahead and should have taken more precautions? I think the history was written only for filler as this book is quite short and is written in big type.I am not saying don't read this book but take it off your wish list and get it at the library instead."
5,An adventure thriller,"This is a story of young Israelis who sought adventure and got more than they bargained for. It is story telling at its finest - suspense, betrayal, courage and loyalty are woven into the dangers of the most inhospitable environment on earth. Don't let it pass you by!"
5,Still going strong,"I got this thing when I was like eleven or twelve years old. I wanted one because all of my friends had one. <3 It was the best then! I went everywhere with it. c: Well, after a few years I had lost it. Today, i found it, got a new battery, and BAM! It's still going. I was even able to download the data and Tamagotchis from before the batteries died. It's fantastic. <3"
3,Tamagotchi......just another craze,"My name is Gianna and I am 11 years old. I bought a tamagotchi and I enjoyed playing with it. After a while, the tamaotchi became boring. That's just wat happens with every toy, but I like tamagotchi V3 better than V2 and the original. The reat features in it are:-There is a new choice when connecting with other V3-you get to play stuff in tamatown and collect passwords-passwords are different for each username-the games are fun-the shop has a lot of stuff which includes a ticket to travel around the worldI enjoyed tamagotchi's but it's just another craze."
5,being the owner,"i am the owner of a tamagotchi pet and i thenk theyre so much fun because you can raise them then make it friends, feed it,shop,play games and pamper it when its sick you can help it when it goes to the bathroom clean it up fun,fun,fun plus it teaches you to be a good pet owner before you test youre skills on a real pet! but you better watch out that if you dont take good care of it they do die awwww.from,mckenzie b."
5,Tested.....,"...and found to have *exactly* the same write time as the Sony. My experience with these same write tests on CompacFlash & SmartMedia cards, which show rather marked differences from brand to brand but little variance among cards from the same manufacturer, indeed suggests that Lexar is the original manufacturer for Sony. Think of the Lexar then as an off-label or generic equivalent to the Sony, made on the same assembly line but offered at a lower price."
4,classic show dvds are not the best quality.,season 3 saw tony shaloub join the cast and that was great move. fan favorite lowell was still on board too. The show never had a bad episode and is still shown in hd on reelz tv channel. the dvd quality is not the best but if love this show you have to have this set.
4,Great show---poor quality,As others have posted we were thrilled to get Wings on DVD but the quality is not great. However it is not so bad that we won't continue to get the rest of the series. LOVE Wings!
5,Wings was the greatest!,"I always loved this show, it still makes me laugh. I plan on buying every season until I have them all!"
2,Excellent show... horrible quality DVD!!,"Favorite show.. but worst quality DVDs ever purchased! Product was even returned and exchanged but replacement DVDs were equally horrible! Amazon.. you have good prices, but the quality of product appears to have declined dramatically. I've made many purchases through this site, but have to say that the purchase of this item was disappointing because of the extremely poor copy quality of the DVDs.Count your lucky stars if you get something you don't have to keep returning!"
4,wings,They sure don't make comedies like they use to. this was one of the best with a gret cast and good story lines
3,"Best sitcom, but disks aren't","Wings has been a favorite sitcom of mine since it first aired. I kept hoping for a long time to see it make it to DVD. I have the first three seasons and enjoy watching them. However, the picture is not very sharp or clear. I've got DVDs of movies made in the 70s that are better than this. And most disappointing of all, Disk 4 of the third season won't even play. My DVD player doesn't even recognize a disk being in the tray. I've cleaned the disk and checked the player. Player works fine with all other disks. Unfortunately I discovered that after the return period was expired. I doubt that I will buy anymore even though I loved the show. Hey people, make sure when buying a boxed set to check out every disk so a return can be made if necessary."
5,WINGS-3 REVIEW.,"FUNNY,IF THERE IS ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE SEASON 3.THE HACKETT BROTHERS HAD ME IN STITCHES.THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THERE BEST SHOWS.CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 4."
2,"Bad quality transfer, great show.",These dvd look like they have been transfered from VHS tapes. What's up with that??
5,The Book is a Feast for the Eyes,"Having personally tasted Chris Ward's culinary delights I was anxious to dig into his wonderful recipes. The book itself is beautiful and the personalization of the recipes with stories, tidbits and hints make an entertaining read. The recipes are laid out well and easily followed. Ingredients are not far out or extravagant. Grandma's Spaghetti Gravy and Chocolate ""Falling Down"" Cake make you want to slap yourself! Buy the book, cook, eat, enjoy!"
4,Like It,"It took longer to get to me them I thought it would, but when it finally arrived I was excited. Unfortunately for me it didn't exactly look like I had thought it would. The bans are thicker then I thought they would be and the diamond is slightly smaller that I thought it would be also. To top it off, the diamond is loose and I can spin it in it's setting, so I'm a little worried about it falling out and losing it.Despite all that, it is an extremely gorgeous ring and I love wearing it. I'll just have to be carefully with the diamond."
1,this is horrible,this is horrible. i think dave pirner last wrote something good in 1981. time to move on folks. you dont listen to dennis de young any longer do you?
2,Great if the kid can't escape!,"I purchased this because Britax had the side impact protection and I love our ROundabout. The seat fit nicely in our SUV and was very secure... my husband couldn't budge it. I loved how the shoulder adjustment was at the twist of a knob. The True Side Impact Protection did not bother my son and he could see just fine.But, when driving with my son, 2, I noticed that he was sitting funny. When I looked back, he had one finger on one pull front harness adjuster and was letting out all the slack in the harness. How safe could the seat be if a 2 year old uses one finger to get out?Shame on Britax for not knowing better! I am going to try the Decathalon too."
2,Careful!! Very Big and non removeable headrest,"Strongly suggest you go in the retail store and see and test this in your car before buying.Also the head rest is not removeable.. the design is such that the baby will struggle to see side-ways and being the curious babies they are, that could be irritating.we returned this one, tried decathlon, that has no side-bars so very tough to stabilise and hence returned that and went with the Marathon.."
5,Using the tether Rear Facing,When you tether the seat rear facing--Do NOT under any circumstances tether it to the tether for that seating position. That tether anchor is for FORWARD facing ONLY. Doing this will not prevent rebound which is what the rear facing tether is designed to do.To tether rear facing you will need to find a non moving part--like the front seat track and use the D-ring attachment that came with the seat. This is an example of why it is important to READ the instruction manual that came with the seat.There are many car seat dedicated message boards on the internet such as www.car-seat.org to help. Also don't forget to get your seat checked by a tech.
4,Good Car Seat- hard to clean...,"We bought this car seat when our little one outgrew her portable one. It is a good, sturdy carseat and it is easy to use. (unlike the carseat in our other car) However with all of the padding it is impossible to clean when she gets any food or toys stuck in it. We ended up buying a carseat cover and now it works great!"
4,Very Comfortable,"I am a car seat technician and have checked and installed a lot of car seats over the years. Britax has the market with regard to comfort, features and safety hands down. Really there isn't a better choice. I like this car seat and my daughter seems to enjoy being in it. A few things I don't like are:The buckle seems very close to the child and it isn't adjustable. I have a four month old now and am using the pillow so maybe it will be better once the pillow is gone, but it seems pretty tight and I wonder if it feels ok once the straps are tightend.I agree with other reviewers that the strap add on's do seem a little excessive and bulky at least with the 4 month old.Not a big deal but the color wasn't as shown on Britax's website there is a lot of brown and beige, not my favorite but we will live with it since the safety benefits and features outweigh the Aesthetics."
3,Different perspective.......,I am from El Paso and have lived here for 20 years. This book was a different perspective to me.......something new! I think many would be surprised at things that have happened.
3,Whitetail FAQ,"I found the photographs more interesting than the text. This book is a compilation of questions received by Rue, consequently what information the book has is presented in a disjointed manner. None of the answers are in depth. The title is a misnomer.I gave the book 3 stars because, although it may be 5 star for the beginning deer hunter, it does not have much to offer one with a few year's experience. In truth, however, it did answer a few questions for me."
3,misleading,"Lots of useless, redundant, common sense information. This is a compilation of letters the author has recieved and responded to. Its more of a ""what is the difference between antlers and horns?"" May be a good read for kids getting into hunting. If you have spent time in the woods chasing whitetails, (not from a vehicle) you know all this book has to offer."
2,Good sauce ideas,"This book is worth the purchase price just for all the sauces. It's so hard for new LC'ers to cook without all the tricks they may be used to from their previous lifestyle, using sugar-filled sauces and condiments.Unlike the '500' or '1000' books, this is not just a few recipes repeated with minor changes and called a new recipe in order to boost the recipe count on the cover."
4,Needs pictures,"Great book, a lot of really good ideas and recipes. There is a TON of artificial sweetener in a lot of these recipes. My main gripe with this book is that there isn't any pictures. So that means, no flipping through and seeing what looks good... because its all text. Other than that, its great."
5,Totally unique.,"I've written two screenplays so far and had trouble with the structure, primarily when it came to the third act. I seemed to run out of steam creatively. I've read Aristotle's Poetics and Joseph Campbell and four other screenwriting manuals that pretty much all said the same thing. The Screenwriter Within says it differently. Gilles makes structuring a story and building a plot easy to understand and, I guess more importantly, easier to undertake. I looked at both of my previous scripts and applied some of the tips that Gilles suggests and realized that the reason my third acts crashed and burned was because my first acts took too long to get started. Instead of feeling happy or at least pleased when I finished my two scripts, I felt defeated. But this book inspired me and motivated me to try and fix one of the scripts. Gilles ends his book with a neat quote that also made me feel writing a good screenplay and even selling it is possible. Highly recommended."
3,"Should be two-and-a-half, but...","This manual is pretty typical of the more personal, chatty type of screenwriting books that have been released recently. As such it's a very easy read and extremely accessible. However, in a number of areas it truly falls short - especially concerning dialogue. On the other hand it is inspirational when it talks about finding story material in your own life and psyche. All in all a mixed bag, truly valuable in some ways, quite flawed in others. Certainly not the ONLY book a beginner should read, but as an addendum to a more solid basic text it may prove to be of help."
2,Watch out !,"Stay away of this book. I'm interested in writing in general, and I've read more then 40 books on the subject. This one doesn't have anything that you can not find in other books. It deals with screenwriting in pretty superficial way. Too many stories from D. B. Gilles' personal life and not much about structure, characterization and dialog. Although you can find chapters on these subjects, but when you read them, there is almost nothing inside. I was disappointed. Besides, it seems to me that among the first 10 reviewers at least 7 of them know D. B. Gilles personally (six of them are from N.Y. and so the writer - coincidence ?) and had written their reviews more or less on the same time. In my opinion, they look more like promotions and not like fair reviews."
3,Cheap price and enjoyable.,"This digest edition, which collects Emma Frost 1-6, is a very enjoyable little read about Emma's life in her early years.However, all 6 covers, by the great artist Greg Horn, are nowhere to be found inside. Even the cover is from issue #8. Huh?If the covers were included inside this would get 5 stars from me. But in the format it is now, it is still worth it for that low price."
5,Yeah were teasing alot!!,Barbarino who would have thought john travolta would be so successful after this series.this is tv shows at there best a must for any collector!
5,"Welcome Back, Welcome Back, Welcome Back","This show had it all, most importantly a great opening theme, and a wonderful cast. This show skyrocketed the career of one, John Travolta and had some great one-liners such as ""Up your nose with a rubber hose"", ""What, Where"" and ""Hi There"".It's great to finally have this great series on DVD after many years of waiting. So sit back and enjoy some classic television."
4,A good old classic,"If your a TV buff, then this is a must have for your collection. Even tho the show was before my time, the jokes and the catch phrases still make me laugh. The show is about a group of trouble makers and their goodhearted teacher. The material maybe out of date(1970s), but it's not out of style. Everybody can relate to a least of the students, whether its Vinnie Barbarino or Boom Boom Washington. I especially enjoyed the uncle/aunt jokes that Mr. Kotter play by Gabe Kaplan tells at the beginning and the end of each episode. This is a great gift for your folks, who will have fond memories of watching this show when they were young. You'll also get a laugh over the crazy hairdos and 70s slang.This is last of the best sitcoms from the 70s. Why the last, you ask? Cuz when they made it, they broke the mold. :)Enjoy!"
5,Why don't they do something like this?,"I'll keep it short and simple. I LOVE this show. It seems they always do something like this when releasing old shows. They release a season or two and then they just stop. Why don't they release the entire series as a box set. Wouldn't that be easier, and satisfy all of us who want the entire series. Quite annoying... and from the looks of it, it looks as though we will never see Season 2. Argh... argh indeed!"
1,STUPID STUPID SHOW,"UNFORTUNATELY, ZERO STARS IS NOT AVAILABLE. YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN BUY THIS AND WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING IT. STUPIDITY REACHES A NEW HEIGHT."
4,"Good, Clean 70's Fun","I had just started high school when this show came out and it was very popular. I had seen a compilation of various shows on DVD and it was very good. I looked forward to Kotter being released in its entirety. I have not been disappointed. I still like it and so do my kids. Everyone knows the main characters and all their catch phrases. So simple, but so funny. The first season will also show Debralee Scott who, in 1976, began playing Mary Hartman's sister.A blast from the past and good clean 70's fun."
2,You probably don't need this book,"I picked up this book after I had been accepted to a law school, but now I feel it was a waste of money. For one thing, I feel that the information is so generic, that any student who has talked someone who is in (or has recently been to) law school or their pre-law advisor would know this. This is espicaly true with the application process. One feeling I got from the book was that it was intended for a freshman in college who is thinking about going about law school. If you are a junior or senior, you probably know the stuff in the book. All and all, not bad but I suggest ""How to Succeed in Law School"" by Gary Munneke if you want to know what law school itself is about."
2,Very weak book in comparison to others of the same type.,"After he persuades you not to go to law school, he gives very short and common descriptions of what law school is like. I think you would definitely be much better off with another book. A student counselor at any major college or university could have just as easily written this book, and quite possibly done a much better job."
3,"Good, but different from the hotel version","I was first introduced to this moisturizer while staying at a Loews hotel -- really rich with an addictive scent (fresh but not overpowering). For Christmas I ordered two bottles as a gift and was disappointed to find that the product was different from the hotel version. It's still a good moisturizer, just not as rich and creamy, and the smell is nice but definitely not quite the same. Since what I received was different than what the hotel product I felt like it wasn't worth paying a premium for this moisturizer. Guess I'll have to stock up next time I'm at a Loews!"
3,"bottles pump, no good, do not work","I order two bottles Lather Bamboo Creme Moisturizer, 8-ounce bottles, the pumps on both bottles did not pump had to take pump caps off and shake bottle upside to get the creme out."
4,"An excellent,, passionate defense of Beethoven's character","In presenting a compelling case for the identity of the Immortal Beloved, which is far more convincing than that offered by the recent film (which was otherwise excellent), the author also provides a passionate defense of the composer's character and values, particularly in his romantic relationships. The Maestro would be pleased. An easy, entertaining read and a well documented and substantiated argument."
3,AN AMATEURISH EFFORT,"This book is clearly by an amateur who struggles to make a case for Erdoty as ""immortal beloved"" and in my view fails. My bias is that Solomon has convinced me it is Antonie Brentano. However the author has compiled a lot of facts that bear on the case, in one way or another,and could be valuable as an encyclopedic resource.There is always the chance that Brentano, like others, was a passing obsession of the composer, and that others had as great a claim on his heart of hearts. Admitting this, a better read is Gregory's historico-fiction My Angel Leonora of 2004, which relates the composer's passions to his music and his search for an ideal father: the many strands of his complex life come together more convincingly if Antonie is the ""beloved."""
5,Amazing quality,I bought this item to help complete a collection of the series. I was wonderfully surprised with the condition the item was in.
4,Good video... poor spanish audio...,"Unfortunately the people at ADV have made a very bad work with the spanish audio, at least on volumes 4 and 5. The spanish track is noticeable lower in loudnes and it seems that it has a ""flanger"" effect on it.One bog thumb down this time."
3,The best of a bad series -,"- and that's condemning with faint praise. The only disc of the lot that's even worth renting as far as I'm concerned, because of the unique enemies this set of angels presents for a giant robot team. Otherwise, my reccomendations remain to look at Bubblegum Crisis (and not 2040, either - the original), Transformers, Macross Plus, or Vandread if you want mecha, or in the Drama and Art sections of the live-action movies if you want introspection and philosophical meaning. To put it another way, let me paraphrase one of the Adventures of Weeble and Bob webcomic/flash thingies:Animefan sings to his Evangelion boxed set: I love Eva... Eva don't lie... I love Eva... almost as much as mecha!CD enters and looks at the box set: What this?Animefan: ... Is mecha.CD: Does not look like mecha.Animefan: Is GOOOD mecha.CD watches the show and grimaces: This tastes of donkey poop!Animefan: Must be bad end.the boxset dumps a load of depression on CDAnimefan: How rare.- CD"
1,Not what I was looking for.,Didn't have the right songs I was looking for. Should have done my research before purchasing. Easy come easy go.
2,Enrico Caruso 21 Favorite Arias,"This CD is my first experience hearing the Caruso voice and found the quality of the singing to leave a lot to be desired. The sound is very uneven and though the restoration must have been very complex it is still difficult to really appreciate what Caruso truly sounded like. Unfortunately, I do not think this CD portrays Caruso as the great tenor he was to the public of his day. An interesting CD to listen to, but gives little to accurately compare him to modern day tenors such as Lanza, Domingo, Pavarotti and Carreras. Interesting as a piece of the past."
5,My favorite in the series so far.,"Some good news to fans- a new celeestial warrior appears, Chichiri. He trained under the watchful eye of Tai-Yi Jun { I can just imagine spending three years with her... that face-_-}. And because of that, he learned some cool moves like how to freeze people {no da! ^-^}.And a turning-point character shows up- Yui, Miaka's best friend. She has a thing for the celestial warrior Tamahome.In the previous book, Yui goes missing, so Miaka goes back through the Universe of the Four Gods so Miaka could find Yui. She goes to the kingdom Qu- Dong, where she believes Yui might be, followed closely by Tamahome. The good news is Miaka finds Yui. At first Yui wants yo go back to Hong Nan with Miaka and Tamahome, but a conversation they have makes her want to reconsider.Wanna read the bad news? I'm not telling you anymore than this.Highly Recommended."
3,Interesting series continuation.,"Yu Watase, Fushigi Yugi: Disciple (Viz, 2000)The third book in the Fushigi Yugi series dips a bit at first, but quickly roars back to become ever better than before. Miaka and the celestial warriors are basically wandering about waiting to find the next celestial warrior, and they find him in Chichiri, the mystical ""cat-guy"" whose powers complement the others quite nicely. All of this is well and good, and covers roughly the first half of the book (though we do get more background on Tamahome as well), which is readable, but nothing special. The second half, on the other hand, is all that and a bag of oysters, as Miaka and the crew find out there's a rival priestess and reveal her identity.Lots of fun. ***"
1,Squeak,"The shoe is comfortable as all Rockports are, but it squeaks all the time. Bought at an outlet. Make me wonder if Rockport knew this and got rid of them at the outlet."
4,V'Adoro Sills,"I originally acquired this recording on vinyl after hearing some of the arias sung at a recital. I was taken by the recording as a whole but was blown away by Sills' rendition of ""V'adoro pupille"". Amazing hardly describes this performance. The floating letato she uses makes this simple melody unforgettable. Then, to top it off, she trills the repeat to perfection. You never want it to end. Treigle is also excellent (his Mefistofele is a must for every collection), but this is Sills' show, and more than worth the price of the recording. My only quibble is that the CD omits one of the preludes recorded for the vinyl edition. Oh well, I suppose one can't have everything, but a re-issue should certainly contain everything on the original."
3,DIFFICULT HANDEL TO SWALLOW,"HANDEL HAS NEVER BEEN MY FAVORITE COMPOSER. I PARTICULARLY HATE THAT MUSICAL MONUMENT TO IMPERIAL ENGLAND CALLED THE MESSIAH. I BOUGHT THIS RECORDING BECAUSE I AM A LOYAL FAN OF SILLS, TREIGLE AND WOLFF, WHOM I SAW MANY TIMES DURING THE GREAT DAYS OF NEW YORK CITY OPERA. I ALSO SAW A PRODUCTION OF THIS OPERA AT THE MET THAT WAS FAR, FAR MORE EXCITING THAN THIS RECORDING, WHICH IS EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW. THE SINGING IS SUPERB, BUT I DO PREFER A COUNTERTENOR IN THE ROLE OF SEXTUS."
1,"This is Handel, not Donizetti!","She ruins the great opera by using bel canto ornaments. This is not to the true Handel style. And besides that, her voice is so shrill that it gives me a headache. Look elsewhere for great Baroque sing...Renee Fleming's Alcina."
5,Great Acting & Unique Psychological Thriller - Plot...,Powerful performance by Billly Zane and an unusual role for Ann Margret- which she carried off with style & class. Original plot and great acting make it a must see psychological thriller movie. Not bloody or gory. Best of all it is a (A) movie so it doesn't need a lot of usless nudity to fill in the gaps in the plot. I was very pleased with my purchase.
4,Memorable...,"Dr. Taylor Briggs (Dead Calm's Billy Zane) is in Brazil for a conference on Alzheimer's disease. He is called upon to consult on an unusual case involving a man covered in a strange orange powder. Briggs is accidentally contaminated by this substance (which he later finds out is only used in ancient tribal rituals). This results in what appear to be blackouts and hallucinations. As the days pass, Briggs realizes that these experiences are actually 30 year old memories from someone else's life! Not just any memories, but those of a serial killer! Briggs becomes obsessed w/ finding out the truth behind these visions. MEMORY is a fast-moving tale of mystery and suspense w/ mystical overtones. Zane is believable as Briggs, and Dennis Hopper, Ann-Margret (Magic, Tommy), and Tricia Helfer do admirable jobs, especially Ann-Margret, who adds a nice jolt to this thriller! And yes, she's still beautiful! Remember to add this one to your collection..."
1,Just a slow movie with a really stupid premis,"The premise of this movie relative to the motive of the antagonist is not at all believable.In fact, although the acting is good it has no real entertainment value at all.Rent it for a dollar but don't think about adding it to your collection unless you collect loosers.In that case it is a must have."
2,ehhhhh.....,"The good reviews for this movie promted me to watch it. I felt it was much better than most of the crappy horror films out there now, but it seemed to drag on forever. Although it was a snooze fest of a movie, it did have its somewhat entertaining moments and was'nt a complete waste of time."
3,DIFFERENT,"With all these stars, how could you not love this movie? The movie plot was different. Let us supposed you got infected by a chemical which allowed you to relive your parent's memories from before you were born and then let's suppose the parent is a serial child abductor and killer. Toss in a girlfriend and you got our story. I would like to point out if you have someone else's memory you should not be seeing yourself as a third person, nor should you be seeing what that other person does not see. That makes simple logical sense which was forgotten by the film makers. Once we get a glimpse of this memory we become more interested in the memory then the boring life of our lead actor. I got bored with the story waiting for the guy to have another memory flash. The memory flashes were too far apart in the beginning to hold my attention."
2,Disappointing.,"I'm a Billy Zane fan and when I saw Memory had some good reviews I jumped on it. Like a swimmer not seeing the rocks in the water below before he leaps...Plodding. Obvious. And please Billy, if you once more verbalized your interior thoughts I thought I'd scream.I was disappointed enough to advise anyone else to:Save your money."
4,different but pretty good,"this movie is a little diffent from you average horror flick, but it was pretty good it's worth the cheap price i paid for it :0)"
2,Nice little feature,"Don't expect a great movie. Depending on your mood, this could be a good movie. Take it for what it is and keep in mind there's a tiny budget."
3,Good place to start for newbies,"POSITIVE: If you're a casual fan or only vaguely familiar with Berlin, this is a great primer. It's affordable, concise and has all the hits.NEGATIVE: I'm not real big on remixes and this album is loaded with them, but for you that may be a plus. Obviously tracks 5-12 are remixes (but what of?). Tracks 1-4 are NOT the original recordings, they are re-recordings. Maybe not a big deal to you but I prefer the originals."
2,disapointing,This item is not what i orderd but a knock off of the GTS solar wing 5 1111 rear shadenot even close in fit also....SENT BACK.....:-(
3,painful truths,"Altho the info in this book is excellent, it is quite disturbing and therefor difficult to read. It is important info and needs an audience, but still is hard to digest as it is truth we have difficulty digesting.Read it if you can...maybe the world can be changed by knowledge."
2,Fascinating and Flawed,"The Body in Pain includes many interesting ideas and theories that could be made into engrossing analyses, yet Elaine Scarry manages to even make torture boring. Her frankly very intelligent observations would be much better suited to a 20 page scholarly essay than a 300 plus page repetitive rant that seems to care more about displaying her verbal acuity than proving a point, let alone attracting readers. I have counted the number of times she uses the word ""sentient"" and ""sentience"": some pages include these terms more than 8 times. One would think that an author so obviously bent on proving her intelligence would deign to consult a thesaurus. Perhaps ""feeling"" is too plebeian a term for her...."
5,Rockshow Comedy Tour,"This is a video I purchased on Amazon as a gift for my daughter. It is a delightful, slapstick-type comedy that's clean,containing nothing suggestive, sacrilegious, or profane. I got it at the last minute and hoped it would arrive in time for Christmas, which Amazon came through, and I was able to wrap it in time. My daughter was very pleased with the gift. I would highly recommend this video for children and adults of all ages who enjoy laughter."
5,Great Video,Tim Hawkins does a great job as well as the other artists. A Comedy show you can show to all ages.
4,Ordsall Board School Days,"Tremendous Production lifts the spirit of the songs to match the heart Graham has always generously offered through his songs. Reminds me so much of the glory days of the beautiful ""Songs For Beginners"" and classic ""Wild Tales"". Why such a long time between these albums is a mystery.The lyrics are always interesting weaving around aimlessly at times yet touchingly sincere throughout. More please. PS I attended the same school as Graham, only ten years after he did."
2,Not the Graham Nash of Young,"Unfortunately the impressive vocal range evident in his earlier years is missing on his latest work. He whispers most of his songs and he truly only sings on one track.The song writing while not poor, also falls well short of the introspective quality of earlier work. If you are a fan of Graham from Songs for Beginners...pass on this one."
3,let down,"they work great, while your not leaking. they would help with not wetting my shirt but only for a min."
3,It's not real; but it might be fun.,"If you are just looking for casino games with the Monopoly twist, this might be for you.Unlike one of the previous reviewers, my copy installed effortlessly and perfectly on my iMac G3 350. No problems there at all! Also, the program runs well and plays as I am sure it should.The only reason I don't like it is that it doesn't play many of the games according to actual casino rules or options. MONOPOLY CASINO has it's own way of doing things, so if you are attempting to recreate Las Vegas in your living room, I suggest you opt for the Hoyle Casino game."
1,Does not work on newer model Macs,"I bought this game thinking it would work for my MacBook Pro. However, while it says it will work with any OS 8.1 or later, it does not work with mine. When I tried to install it, I get a message saying I do not have the ""Classic"" system that it requires to use."
4,My toddler loves it,"I got this book as a donation from a book swap, with the stickers already placed. Even so, my toddler loves to listen to the riddles and look at the pictures of the sea animals. It's a pretty simple book, covering things like lobsters, jellyfish, seals, eels, rays, and starfish, but it's a nice book for reading with a small child."
2,Not Great,"I ordered this with a tripod combination. I like the tripod (190XV) but the head is not very impressive. When tilting up and down, the panning part of the mount wobbles noticeably. I will try one of the other reviewer's suggestions."
1,Junk - Flawed Design,700RC2 head is flawed.The head clamps onto a quick release plate mounted on the bottom of your camera. The plate is nice and makes a secure connection to the camera without tools/coins.Unfortunately the head's clamping lever cannot fully rotate when your camera is on the head. Only very thin camcorders will work with this plate/head design. My Beachtech box impedes the lever.
2,Below Bogen's standards! Get the 701RC2 instead!,"I accidentally purchased this video head instead of the 701RC2. Big boo-boo! This video head is not built to the ordinary standards of Bogen. It is flimsy by comparison to the 701RC2, not as smooth and does not have an adjustable sliding base plate. Worse, the rapid connect plate is not clamped in with a lever as you would ordinarily expect but requires the screwing down of a clamp which takes longer. Adding insult to injury, the lever screw is blocked by your camera when it is on the quick release plate interfering with the securing of the video camera.This is, to say the least, a poorly thought out video head and the ONLY benefit it offers over the MUCH superior 701RC2 is this it is slightly lighter, but achieves this by sacrificing build quality and important features.Unless you have held and operating this video head and know it is precisely what you want do not risk purchasing it. Purchase instead the far superior 701RC2."
4,Nice tripod head for spotting scope,"Of course no product can be all things to all people. That said, this tripod head works perfectly with a spotting scope (as these are narrower than a camera) but I can see that the locking screw could interfere with mounting a wide camera. The quality of manufacture is evident. I love the screw down feature for the QR plate rather than the swiveling clip-- it takes a couple of seconds more when setting up, but you know that your equipment is very well secured. The smaller size and weight of this head is welcome when lugging your tripod and scope for any distance. I haven't had a chance to field test it yet, but will update this review once I have."
3,Not great for DSLR's..,"I was stupid buying this to use with my DSLR. While it works.. attaching the camera to the head is a pain in the butt as it is designed primarily for narrow long camcorder form factors instead of wide DSLRs.What this means is the lever to tighten the plate to the head goes about half a turn and hits the bottom of the camera.You have to then pull the lever, rotate the the lever half a turn and start tightening it again to the plate. On a narrow camcorder..it is not an issue as the tightening lever is unobstructed.Other than that complaint, the head is nice!"
4,Manfrotto 700RC2 Mini Video Head,"This product is pretty much exactly what it states. The movement is very fluid and easy to control, and the head, like most Manfrotto equipment, is well built. I wouldn't use it for any medium heavy to heavy equipment, it is not built for that, but for small to medium equipment it works really well. The plate is a little laborious to change, if you really need to do quick changes with multiple pieces of equipment, it lacks a some. If you have 15 to 20 seconds to make your change (assuming you have a plate on each piece of equipment), then you should be fine. I have overall been very satisfied with the head."
4,"Quirky, but great","The screw interferes with my camera if I have the battery grip on it. There needs to be a perfect storm in order for it to work easily. I hate the RC2 plates, but I have several and I have to admit, they are sturdy and I feel secure with my camera on it. For what this is (a $75 head) I really can't complain. The handle comes off and the head stows perfectly in my luggage for travel. The handle is adjustable and gives me a nice, smooth pan or tilt. It offers limited movement, but it's also very small, sturdy and easily portable. I gotta say...I'm always looking at new heads, but I always end up sticking with this one because it works. And, like an old relationship, I may complain or get tired of it, but in the end I really do love it. I just have to complain about something."
4,Great low cost video head,"I use a Sony Handycam on this head, and it helps me produce smooth pans in my vacation videos. The adjustable handle makes it easy to position the camera at any reasonable angle, and the head is lightweight, which is good for an old geezer like myself."
4,Page turning look at life on the streets of LALA land,"A Permanent Twilight, Freadhoff's second effort, Blue Rain being first, had me glued to the story of a LA newspaper reporter, Johnny Rose fighting to absolve his guilt when his runaway teenage cousin gets murdered as he watches helplessly. The author had done his homework and described the daily struggles homeless kids face everywhere, whether in Phoenix or Hollywood. His descriptions and dialogue bring the fear, danger and frustration of trying to deal with the real world of Hollywood Boulevard versus the fanatasy world portrayed by the travel brochures. The story grabbed me from the beginning and kept me guessing all the way to the last chapter as to whodunnit! It is a good read."
3,Mixed Feelings...,"When I got a Tamagotchi, I was very excited. My friend had a Tamagotchi, and our Tamagotchis became friends. I had a lot of fun with it. I could feed it, scold or praise it, and play games to get Gotchipoints. After a while, I found a downside to it. Although you can turn the sound off, the Tamagotchi is constantly making bleeps and beeps, telling you that its sick, went to the bathroom, or it needs something. Sometimes it will become unhappy, and there's nothing you can do about it. Then the Tamagotchi started to get on my last nerve. So, I didn't play with it as much. And when you don't take care of you Tamagotchi, it dies. So overall, it depends on how much patience you have. If you are naturally impatient, like me, a Tamagotchi may not be the right pet for you. But if you can put up with having to take care of a pet all your own, and you have the time to care for it, a Tamagotchi would be great for you."
4,Tamagotchi V3,I have two Tamagotchi V3s they are not very educational but they are a ton of fun to take care of it is easey to see how your parents take care of you. It is really a great toy to have
5,Tamagotchi Connection: V3 Educational and Fun too,This game is educational because it teaches responsbility and it teaches in a step by step process. I diffently recccomend this for everyone. (you can get passwords for this game at tamagotchi.com)

I really must say this is one of the best version of Tamagotchis ever created. I like http://tamatown.com . I helped make it! Hey! Bandai's Sweetheart is also a Computer genius. Who knew? I'M BANDAI'S SWEETHEART! STEP BACK WANNABE! ASK BANDAI YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME!
4,Good Quality DVD Player. No DivX/XviD Support in US Model.,"Video via the HDMI is excellent. Audio using the coaxial out is also crisp and clear. Definately an above average player. That said though, I do not see any noticable improvement using either 720p or 1080i settings and HDMI output compared to my other player (Denon DVD-3800) which is using component outs. I observed no difference between the HD950 and the Samsung DVD-HD850. Television used was a Sony HDTV KD-34XS955 34"" WEGA. This player was purchased primarily for the HDMI capability and the DivX playback support I had read about in reviews. However, the version of the DVD-HD950 available in the United States does NOT support DivX/XVID playback. The HD950 image on the Samsung website does show the DIVX logo on the player, but the player shipped to me did not have the logo when it arrived. I verified the lack of DivX playback myself with many file types/settings and double checked with Samsung support."
1,Very disappointed,"I usually have decent luck with buying equipment - not this time. This Samsung unit was unreliable and is inferior to others in or below its price range. The loading device would freeze occasionally, the volume would sometimes inexplicably cut-off, and it delivered very noisy HD.I've since replaced it with a less expensive Panasonic unit that puts it to shame. Consider other units before this one."
1,AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME,"Usually I Love Andrew Neiderman's work. However, this book borders on being unreadable. It was never even remotely interesting. It was a complete and utter disappointment and failure."
2,It's not perfect,"I installed the Hot Link pro and it works...more or less. It is very sensitive to interference, the cabinet contains an array of low voltage lighting and the power (or the supply) fully jams the IR side, with the lights off the Hot Link works better but still exhibits erratic sensitivity! Sometimes it works from 30 feet other times we must go stand if front of the detector before it will operate. I had to add some shielded coax to extend the 6' detector lead, that may have made the interference somewhat worse. It is inexpensive but I don't recommend it!"
5,"Wonderful Product, Wonderful Service!","I have owned this amazing product for nearly two years and it works great. Allows me to tuck my components into the cabinet and still control the AT&T U-Verse, DVD player, and Onkyo receiver, with any of my remotes. The company also stands behind their products. I sent them an email as I thought the unit wasn't working. They called me within minutes. It turns out I just didn't have the emitter pointed at the ""eye"" for the DVD player. Once I repositioned the emitter, it was up and working. The nice thing is that they assured me that if it was actually not working, they would immediately ship me another one, even though it is two years old. This is how service should be!"
5,Great Yet Inexpensive...,"This is perhaps the best product of its kind in the market. It works right out of the box and does not require extensive wire hookups or kits. I use it in my bedroom with a plasma TV and it works really well. Since the receiver is very sensitive, you have to ensure that it is hidden from the plasma screen. However, it does not require a direct line of site with the remote control. So you can keep it under the cabinet or behind the plasma, and it works! The blue LED which acknowledges reception of the remote's signal helps in debugging any installation issues. I am extremely satisfied with the product."
5,Excellent Product,"I have this set up with my Plasma and all th Home Theater peices in a closet. The Ribbon Cable is a bit of a nusance, but a minor issue. My only other suggestion would be to leave the Sticky pads off the IR blasters so the end user can orient the IR blaster how they need to. I found that some of my pieces wouldn;t work with the Blaster just stuck and facing over the top. I moved the sticky pad to the front of the blaster so I could place it directly on the Eye of the unit I wanted.Works flawlessly with the Harmoney Remote and every peice in my HT.Be mindful of what retailer you order form here. NorthStar Electronics is extremely SLOW to ship and was a major hold up in my HT installation. . Took them 2 weeks from order to my having it in hand. In todays etailing world.. Not all that acceptable especially if you are paying for shipping on top of it."
1,Lousy,This thing worked for a very short period (a couple of weeks) and then stopped to react. I have cycled through all connectors and now after only a few months of use I have none of the connectors left still working. I would not recommend wasting money on this product.
1,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this item based on the positive reviews I had read, but the quality was not what I had hoped for and it ultimately didn't even work.I included the item as part of a home theater install being performed by a electronics installation company. Out of the box, only one of the transmitters illuminated, and that one wasn't event carrying the signal to the components. Several of the other transmitters slipped off their wires during installation.Bottom line: I wasn't able to control any components using this product. I ended up returning the item and going with a different solution."
3,Beware the shipper- unit works great,"Bought this unit to replce one that I have had for 7 years, but finally failed. When I received the unit, found that it came from the ""Returns Department"" at Amazon. The unit had been opened, and apparently used. Of the 6 IR attachments, two had the ""tape"" removed from their fronts. Neither of these two worked. The other 4 worked, and I only needed 4, so I sucked it up and kept it.As for the unit, it works well ( well enough that I wanted to buy another one after 7 years). Would recommend the unit, just be sure you get a new one."
5,Works as promised,"I've purchased this product 3 times now (for 3 different units, 2 different homes), and have been completely satisfied with them all. Some reviewers have indicated delays with certain equipment, particularly the DirecTv units, with which I also had some initial challenges. However, the trick for this is to place the emitter away from your flatscreen TV to reduce interference (like to the side, well underneath, or behind the screen (yet still in line of sight). Support is outstanding, including free replacement of the sticky pads for the IR emitters. Easy setup, works well -- overall great bang for your buck."
5,It Works it Really Works,"I wanted to hide away my Tivo, Blue-ray, and receiver so I shopped around for products and found that some were thousands of dollars,Hot Link is amazing, don't let the price fool you. I installed it in an hour hiding all the wires and routing everything behind the wall (in a closet) of my 50"" plasma all my separate remotes work! I mounted the eye on the underside of the plasma and I have no interference.I was truly amazed and recommend this product to all who wish to hide away all that equipment and all those wires."
5,Awesome Product!,We purchased this item in order to hide our components. It actually made our system work quicker. It also works along with our Logitech Harmony One universal remote. Our components are in a closet behind our TV and we have not had any issues. It is a great prouct and I would recommend it to everyone!
5,Great Product--Excellent Customer Service,"I bought one of these in Sept of 2009 but did not install it until December of 2009 because we were remodeling. It worked for two days and then would not power up. I ordered a replacement on my own and then notified Microsmith. They sent me a replacement immediately so now I have two. I use the second in the bedroom.The product works great even with my plasma tv. The only bad part about the product is the packaging. Don't let it fool you when you first open the shipping box. The graphics on the box are cheap looking, tacky, and look like they were designed in 1980. But the product is great. This is a far superior set up in comparison the pyramid radio frequency transmitters that you see at Radio Shack and Crutchfield."
1,Keep Looking,I bought this to hide my Comcast 8300 hd box in the closet. Worked Amazingly....... for two weeks. then dropped signals to HD box and to appleTV. I exchanged for a second unit and again... Amazing ... for 1 week. Dropped signal to HD box and AppleTV. Keep looking and hope you find a better product.I know I will keep looking.
4,Works better than I hoped,I love this repeater. The construction looks a little low tech but the execution is well thought out. It has increased my signal acceptance by ten fold. The only gripe I have is the velcro mounting tape for the receiver eye is a bad idea. I had to replace it with a much stronger double stick foam to keep it attached to the back of my TV. Other than that I fully recommend this product.
4,Excellent Product - works GREAT,"I'm very pleased with this. I put the sensor below/behind the plasma and frankly my DirectTV works better now than when I had to open the cabinet door. I don't ever give 5 stars, but there is little negative I can say. I installed the item in about 30 seconds without instructions. The sensor cable is about 6ft but you can extend it with the proper gauge coax (standard RCA connector) although I would guess it will weaken the signal a little. If you need to control 6 devices in a closet and hide the sensor, this product is perfect and cheapest solution I found. I think I will be buying another for downstairs."
5,well designed product,"Works as advertised. Very handy blue LED tells you when it sees IR traffic, so easy to figure out how to minimize extraneous IR noise. Has excellent circuitry to filter ambient IR as well. My remotes work almost anywhere you point them, and allows me to hide all my components completely.Well done."
5,Infrared repeater,"Very simple and effective infrared repeater.You locate the almost invisible sensor up front and all your equipment (DVD player, cable box, etc) can be behind the wall or hidden inside a cabinet. All you need to know is where the device infrared sensor is located and stick one of the repeater little heads right in front of it.Works great."
4,Great Product and Simple Design,"My setup includes a 50' wall mounted plasma and a/v components hidden in a closet 10ft away. The product design is very simple w/power cable, receiver eye/cable, transmitter LEDs/ribbon cable, and module.The receiver works well with the plasma, although it took some tweaking to position the receiver eye to minimize interference from the plamsa. Once positioned the unit works great with all of my a/v components. The module is small and easily hides behind my a/v components.There is one annoying problem. There is a confirmation LED that is part of the ribbon cable for the transmitter LEDs. The confirmation LED confirms a signal was received from you remote (anytime a button is pushed) by the unit. In applications where your TV is more that 10ft away from your a/v components it is not possible to mount the confirmation LED where it is visable from your TV."
1,This thing is soooooo finicky,"I have had this for 6 months now, it works intermittently at best. I get it working all set up with everything fine. This will last for a couple of days. Then it stops working, so I have to unplug it to get it to reset (I guess). After unplugging, it will work again for a day or two, then back to having to unplug it. I am getting something else."
1,Not compatible with U-verse,"The Hot Link Pro was not compatible with the Motorola VIP 1225 HD DVR that was recently installed by ATT Uverse. It seemed to control everything else just fine, but there was absolutely no response from the VIP 1225. That leads me to believe that Hot Link Pro can't reproduce a high enough frequency signal or something. I'm familiar with interference and saturation in IR systems, but with those problems you usually see SOME response. In those cases the device responds a little (maybe the wrong thing happens, or something only happens intermittently), but in this case, the device didn't respond ever while all other devices were working fine."
1,plasma problems,"I tried every possible placement and never got rid of the plasma tv interference. It never controlled my components better than without it. Therefore, I can't recommend it for plasma tv's."
3,Acceptable,"It was relatively easy to install, though the instructions were not very clear. When I was done with the install, the wires are a real rats nest. I use a Logitec Harmony remote, and have a Hughes HDTV DirectTV receiver, and the performance with the receiver is hit and miss (doesn't work as reliably as just pointing the remote at the receiver). The product is very sensitive (the receiver on the booster), which is good, but It's not very easy to mount (drill a hole in your cabinet and install a screw... seems like I probably got what I paid for."
4,Pretty Good,"Given the popularity of mounting Flat Screen TVs this product has a high functionality. I noticed due to its high sensitivity it sometimes repeats the signal too much and repeats the functions on the other end. I also noticed on some of my cheap electronics (The temporary $30.0 DVD player it was plugged into for a short while) it doesnt recognize the signal. All in all it works pretty well, much better than any remote signal jumper. Scale of 1-10 7.8"
5,Works very well,"I've set up a couple of these now and they do what they're supposed to. The blue indicator light could be a little less bright, but if it's put behind something, it's not to distracting."
5,Works Great!,"Works as advertised. I placed the remote sensor inside the cabinet ""looking out"" through the gap between a door and the cabinet."
4,Expensive but a great addition,"The Hot Link Pro arrived on time and in good condition. It was a snap to set up and the instructions, though very, very limited, were sufficient for my needs. I have a DVR and AV amp hidden behind a pull down screen and I use this unit to send commands to these two components and the reception is better than that on the units themselves.Unlike some of the reviews here I found that the remote eye wire leads plenty long enough to run from below the cabinet and up to the components. The ribbon cord can be a little intimidating since you have to pull the strands apart to run them to the independent components but the truth is that the wires separate easily and it's not a big deal.Overall: I think this unit works really well and is a real savior for someone that has IR components hidden behind an obstruction. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a little pricey."
5,Is there anything else?,"I am now on my 4th purchase of this product. It works great! Put all your components out of sight, attach the sensors, plug it in and you're good to go. Never had any problems. Only one complaint is that the sensor eye cable was too short for one installation I had. It is only 6' and I really needed an extra foot or two. Love this product, wish they made a simpler version to control just one device (the DirecTV box).In fact, they should just cut a deal and build it into the DTV box to begin with."
2,2 Units bad in 3 months,Used this item before. Seemed to work well. Just began receiving a lot of call backs after installing this item. Very sensitive to LCD and Plasma light output. Sensor is disturbed if not blocked because of light output. In addition the extra emitter eyes when close together cause blue indicator light to stay on as well.
1,The cable is awful,I would avoid this product because the cable may get damaged when you strip it down to separate the emitters.
4,AWESOME,"Meant to click 5 STARS but couldn't edit my selection! This product is great. It is extremely easy to install. It took all of 5 minutes and I was up and running. The component remotes truly work better than they did prior to installing The Hot Link Pro. As everyone says the cable for the ""eye"" is short but all of the informamtion is in the box to help you order accessories. As always the shipping was unbelievably fast I had the product within 3 days of ordering!"
1,The shortest book in the world,This book is a joke.... it has no real information and is nothing more than a chance for the writer to make a buck off the title.
1,"You people are kidding, right?","Misery Index is like Dying Fetus without the catchy pit riffs, without the breakdowns, without the groove, and without the growl.And that's a good thing because...?"
4,"Solidly Assembled, Mastered","I enjoyed these discs very much. As for the sound quality it is very typical of 78 rpm remastering from the period that this cd was released. It is not a sonic disaster by any means. Much of the material sounds very much like it has been issued previously on vinyl. There are a couple of tracks that have some slight rough edges, but then that is to be expected on material of this age. Having said that, this set is not the last word on the mastering of this material to cd. A great set of Ellington's music."
2,"Sublime Music, Unconscionable Sound Quality","I've had this CD for several years, but have never really enjoyed it, even though most jazz aficionados say this is some of the greatest American music ever created. Then I picked up Complete Columbia & RCA Victor Sessions with Ben Webster (a 2000 release from Definitive Records, a Spanish label), which has remastered versions of all the RCA recordings (and more). I couldn't stop listening to it!!! The Definitive recording brings out all the colors that were missing fromt the dull, monochrome RCA. It's an entirely different listening experience. There's a little more noise and hiss, but that must be the price you pay for more texture and color."
5,I Must Be Lucky....,"I bought the CD set recently and the sound quality is as good as or better than the original 78's in my father's collection AND some of the LP material re-released in the '50s. The material is available (piece-meal) on other CDs if you so detest the sound quality.In general, I've found that material ""re-mastered"" and released on CD sounds a bit flat: the engineers try to compensate with their multifrequency equalizers, but it ain't the same. Anyway, the music and this band reflect what I see as the high point in Ellington's career. It's also interesting to note that record producers during his hey-day made some lousy choices in material for the band to record: it's fun to hear some schmaltz and novelty songs sprinkled in amongst the musical diamonds shining in this collection. This music shall never come our way again; so, buy it, savor it, enjoy it!"
3,"Product is good, but probably not strong enough.","Men start suffering symptoms of a tired prostrate from 45+ years old. I think I was about 50 when I first noticed having to pee more. I used to be able to fly to London (8hrs) and did not need to go after drinking several glasses of wine. Those days have long gone, I am lucky if I can make it through the night without getting up. I went to my Doctor and he confirmed a slightly larger prostate. I had the PSA done and it was higher but nothing to worry about. My doctor then prescribed a pharmacutical remedy which I refused. I do not digest anything which is not natural, So I tried Saw Palmetto, which worked but not really enough. I completed my two bottles and decided to try something else and found Prostanew (Also on Amazon) This supplement is also natural but more comprehensive. I take 2 capsules/day and this is working really well. So, although Saw Palmetto is good, there is a better choice. Check it out."
1,DANGER!!!!!!!!!!!,please think when you purchace this toy when I put in the batteries incorecly it blew up and burt my arm and killed 2 of my pet ants it was vwey sad. but on the other hand I think this toy teachs a child the responsebility raising a pet also its poket sized and very fun so try to be carful!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Evil Tamas,"We, the Tamagothchi's will take over the world! Mwahhaha! Kids everywhere are taking us in their homes! no one will stop us! first, we take over the Web. Next time your in a chat room, be careful, you might be talking to one of us! I am a tama from ETSWD ( Evil Tamas Seeking World Domination )"
4,I Love My Tamagotchi,Tamagotchis are one of the best toys you can get because they are just like electric pets. My sister and I connect a lot and we've had them for a week and they work really well. I recommend it.
1,"Very, very bad !","Honestly, this one is a waste of time and budget (if there's any).Very bad movie, terrible amateur acting (I especially couldn't stand the acting of the actresses who play the mother and the daughter, to the point that I started to fast forward their scenes).It seems like a student project.One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time."
1,Don't waste your time,"SO Boring. Nothing new, sub par acting, less than sub par budget. Standing in a dark closet with a flashlight would be scarier and more entertaining. Waste of time and money."
2,"A mediocre copy of 2009's ""The Road""","There have been a lot of post-apocalyptic films in recent years, with most of the big budget ones being pretty awful. The Collapsed is one of many low budget takes on the genre, and while it's far better than anything released by The Asylum, it's still nothing more than a mediocre copy of 2009's ""The Road"", which was done on a small budget but had the benefit of a quality actor (Viggo Mortensen). If you enjoy post-apocalyptic films, you might like this. Just be prepared for a mediocre product."
1,Meh,"Great opening credits, then downhill from there. Cheesy effects and a family you love to hate (is someone in pyschoanalysis?) make for a recipe for disaster."
1,save your money,"very low budget film, bad acting, So bad in fact I started cheering for the bad guys.The only good part is that all are dead by the end of the movie."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"Visually impressive with a solid cast carrying the story from start to finish, The Collapsed was an impressive slice of cinema. It was engaging, tense and in at least one scene managed to shock me in the direction that the plot took.The Collapsed is definitely a film for the patient viewer and for my money another score for good solid independent filmmaking."
3,I've seen worse.,"While this movie falls into the ""Post Apocalyptic"" genre, it lacks many of the essentials of that genre. I would guess they did as little in the way of a storyline to save on the budget. I would have liked to have seen more of a back story as to what befell humankind that drove them to the lengths they took. What happened in the city that forced them into the woods? Did whatever this ""Thing"" is, happen all over the world, or did it just start in that city? There are just too many unanswered questions that pertain to this movie to really be pulled in. While the premise of the movie was a good one, without the back story it just becomes another ""Killer in the woods"" storyline."
1,Not a well written Chemistry book,"I have been using this book, at the parent's request, to tutor a home schooled student in Chemistry. Aside from the Christian point of view of this book, it is needlessly wordy and poorly written. When teaching Chemistry, it is important to explain the basis of Chemistry and the Periodic Table of Elements. These things are not done until many chapters into the book. Also the author of the book uses personal pronouns. This may just be a pet peeve of mine but I do not need the author's opinion in the book. Just the facts please. I understand if you want a Creation-centered Chemistry book, but there have to be better ones than this. You really are doing a disservice to your child by getting this book."
5,Excellent College Prep,"I just completed my Freshmen year studying mechanical engineering at a well respected state school. After using this chemistry text in highschool, I literally coasted through general chemistry I and II finishing with straight A+ in both semesters. I highly recommend this book to any highschooler, especially those wanting to pursue a technical degree."
2,Don't bother,A big yawn. I keep waiting for Stephen Lang to get asked to star in something more substantial so he can quit making these forgettable movies.
5,"A must read book - To me, just the best book written on Cyprus ever.",To me it is the best book written on Cyprus ever.There should be a new edition.I already had this book and I ordrered a new one to offer it to a friend.This book is interesting because it goes back to the 50s and shows the mechanism of Turkish propaganda concerning the period between the 50s and 1974.I don't agree with some comments here. It is not true that the book does not speak of 1974 events. It is the countrary. The book speaks of everything and shows manipulation and propaganda that led to the partition of the Island.A must read book
2,A Biased Approach,"Though well organized, this study consistently ignores the main reason behind Turkish intervention to Cyprus in 1974. The Greek-led coup, headed by a well known criminal Nikos Sampson, had tried to unite the island with Greece where a military junta was ruling by then. Dr. Ioannides also does not mention any of the atrocities committed against thousands of defenseless Turks, by ruling Greek majority in pre-74 period.The book is a good reflection of Greek-Cypriot sentiments and is biased in many aspects in evaluation of the main reason behind the problem."
1,A TOTALLY BIASED APPROACH,"Dr. Ioannides's book totally disregard the main fact behind the Turkish Government's decision and turns out to be a book against the muslim part of the world.He disregard that in existence of a conflict there is two part for it. Would be better if written again by objectively explaining more in depth what was the politics of the Greece during 169 through 1974 and also including the currant development in Eagean Sea in 1997, Greece Army trying to take over the Cos island by using the priests and innocent animals!!"
4,Recent Purchaser - Have .75 arces of lawn,"i've only used this product once, but found it to be a solid solution. i placed two concrete blocks on it and it worked like a charm.Be prepared to spend an hour or more for assembly. The directions are pretty good but there are a lot of parts."
3,Purchased as gift...,"My grandchild indicated she loved it... I Purchased this as a gift along with a stuffed animal. I rated it average only because I have very limited knowledge of its durability, educational value, or quality."
4,Swordfish/Termination 3: Rise of the Machines,"Swordfish is great when it comes to matters like secret societies, just like Dr. Strangelove. Rise of the Machines, well I'm not that into machines."
5,What more can I say about Van Cliburn,"Van Cliburn and I are about the same age, and I remember when he, an American, won his prize in Moscow. His versions of the Rachmaninoff and Tschaikovsky Piana Concertos are breathtaking. This music is of the category of ""from God's lips to the ear of the composer, and Van Cliburn adds that extra bit of magic.There are many other versions of the Rachmaninoff as well as the Prokofiev, but, if this is your first CD of these pieces, I would highly recommend purchasing this version.Perfection."
1,Poor quality . Skipps and is sometimes unable to play.,This recording is not as clear as an older version I have. The recording skips and often fails to play.
4,Great seat - but HUGE,"We recently ordered this seat for our 3-year-old daughter who had outgrown our other Britax car seat. Britax makes great car seats, but buyer beware...this car seat is huge. I would not fit in my husbands Honda Civic at all, and it barely fits in my Subaru Forrester. Thankfully, we had the Forrester or else we would have had to return this seat and get something else. Other than that, it seems to be a nice seat made well. The only other thing I wish it had were cup holders, but we can work around that one."
3,HUGE - for 22lb and up?,"This seat was even bigger than I expected! My son is 18 months old and 30lbs, and will outgrow his Roundabout soon. He is big for his age, so I thought this seat would be perfect for my husband's car (figured it would last us a long time with the 80lb limit). However, my son is dwarfed in this thing, which is ok I guess, but I just don't see how a kid any smaller could properly fit in this! So be forwarned if your kid is closer to the 22lb mininum..."
4,Great for our needs,"I bought this car seat after lots of research on what front facing car seats fit in Honda Civics. This one does, however it would be nearly impossible to put another car seat next to it as it is VERY wide. The strap to tighten is much harder than it was on our Chicco Infant seat, which we LOVED!I gave it 4 stars because it is easy to get my very wigggly 14 month old in and out. And she seems to be very comfortable in it. Overall I am very statisfied, although I have only had it for 1 month."
4,Fantastic seat for safety (wish it was darker),"Again, given the opportunity, we wouldn't buy anything but Britax. Great product. Although this seat is pretty big, it isn't mammoth. It is more of a pain to move than our smaller model, so we won't be trading between the two cars. I agree with other reviewers - the restraints are a little flimsy and twist a lot more than other models we have purchased. That is annoying, but I'd still purchase this seat again. I wish we could've purchased this seat when darker models were available. I'm hoping the tan doesn't end up looking grey. :)I would definitely recommend this product. (4-stars due to the flimsier restraints.)"
3,Good not great,"We started with the Gracco baby carrier, we then went to the Britax Roundabout (excellent car seat, we have three) so the next natural step was to go up to the Regent. My biggest complaints are the mechanism that loosens/tightens the strap. It's not as nice and easy to use as the push button on the old Roundabout. Also, the straps that go over the kids' shoulders do get twisted. This never happened with Roundabout.I also have a Alpha Omega Elite that was one hundred dollars and it is comparable to this seat. The reason we bought the Regent was the hopes of the straps not twisting and the ease of getting the child in and out. If I were to do over again, I would not buy this seat."
5,"My Daughter Loves This ""Arm Chair""","Even though this is a humongous seat, I feel good knowing it'll hold my daughter safely for several more years before she outgrows it. It fits in my Honda Civic just fine, and I love that the straps don't get twisted. When your 3.5 year old is into doing it all by herself, it's a miracle they DON'T get irreparably twisted. The chest buckle is simple and light enough she can snap it together herself (but don't worry, she can't UNDO it), which helps in the ""do it myself"" area. Both kid and mom vote yes for this seat. Dad votes ""did you have to get it in those colors?!"""
3,"Very large car seat, no leg room in Uplander 08 van for 3 YO","I bought this car seat because the 5-point harness straps are higher than the Graco Nautilius. It is so huge, my son has very little leg room. Same issue in both my 04 Grand Prix and 08 Uplander van. I have no idea how he will be able to use this in a year or two. The other cons are it is hard to install and expensive. Even the car seat technicians had trouble installing it."
4,Great Seat,"This seat is great for my three year old who was just on the upper end of the height and weight limit on his britax roundabout. We gave it to him as a birthday present and he showed it off to everyone. It is a bit harder to install so I haven't yet moved it from the one car I installed it in, but I got a great tight fit in the car and my guy rides snug and safe in it always."
4,Solid and Heavy,"Pros: Solid construction, lots of room (width-wise), 5-point harness, Fit in the middle seat of a smaller car (I drive Honda Fit 2010).Cons: HEAVY! This means that it is not convenient to move it from car to car every day! Once you install it, it should ideally stay in that car. It does not install as easily (partly because it is heavy and unwieldy to maneuver). Despite following the instructions, I still don't feel that the car seat is anchored as solidly as if I was anchoring a Britax Marathon.Background: We have always use Britax. When our daughter outgrows her Britax Marathon we got a Britax Regent. The Regent is very good and it works fine, we've used it for a year (It's just hard to beat Britax Marathon; I think its the best car seat ever). BTW, all Britax carseats really have a solid construction compare to other car seats I have inspected when I shopped around in the last 5 years."
5,Best carseat ever!,"I have kids that are tall, and this is the cadillac of all car seats! It is big, but had no problem fitting two in both cars. They are cushy, and have handy pockets on the sides, perfect for books and sippy cups. This is the last car seat you'll ever need! So worth the money!"
2,No good for skinny kids,"I read somewhere that this seat used to be called the ""Husky"" and I can understand why. The closest crotch strap placement still makes for a very roomy fit for my skinny 3-year-old. He moves around so much within the straps even when they are pulled tight. I spent LOTS of money getting 2 of these seats for our 2 cars and now I'm going to have to get new seats because my son really isn't safe and secure. A disappointment to say the least. I have the Britax Roundabouts as well and LOVE those."
4,Hard to fit in vehicle,"If you don't have a newer vehicle with the LATCH restraints, and your child is under 40 pounds, you are going to have a difficult time installing this seat. The problem we have in our Honda Odyssey and Accord is that the Obyssey does not have latch in the 3rd row, and the Accord does not have it at all (1998 model). The required installation for children under 40 pounds, using the vehicles seat belts, requires extremely long seat belt lengths -- longer than we have in either vehicle.Please check your installation requirements before purchasing!"
5,Importance of a five point harness car seat. 7 year old still in,"Best car seat available. Good price, easy to install. We feel safe and secure. Plenty of room to grow for my 4 year old, and also a comfortable and safe seat for my 7 year old. Better than the average booster that is held only by an adult seat belt. Tether anchor gives added security. Would NOT buy any other car seat. We have a small SUV and the seat is very large, so we had to give up the ""third"" middle seat between the two Regents but SO WORTH it for the saftey. Please check out this video about a five point harness.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azgBhZfcqaQCut and paste in your browser if direct link does not work."
4,Great!,"My tall 3 1/2 yr old loves this seat. Her little sister inherited her Britax Marathon (which I also love). This seat is a bit large and heavy, but that is to be expected with a seat designed for older kids.Complaints:-The side pockets are nice, but a cup holder would have been even better.-the stabilizer bar underneath was a BEAR to get in. I had to use a rubber mallet to pound it in.-pricey - again, to be expected for what you are really getting (safety)I liked it so much I bought 2 (plus 2 Marathons earlier)."
2,Not for Sub-Compact Cars.,"Although this seat appears to be well worth the money especially for safety features, I was unable to use it. I have a Honda Fit and no matter how I positioned the back seat and moved the front seat up, my 3 1/2 year old daugter could not put her feet straight. The car seat is pretty big and is better suited for a full size car, minivan of SUV.I'm so upset, I really wanted a seat with the 5 point harness that was made for older children.I guess I'll be returning it."
5,Love this seat! Better than a booster!,"My daughter is almost 5 and just over 40# and we loved our Britax Roundabout and hated to depart with it. This seat hooks up like the Roundabout, and is much roomier for her. She can get in an buckle up by herself just like the Roundabout and we have lots of room to grow in this seat. Worth the price for the safety of the 5-point latch and ease of use. It sits beautifully in our Honda CRV. The fabric is nicer than shows. We love it!"
5,Highly Recommended,I bought this for my son when he reached over 40 lbs and very satisfied. That's why I bought the same thing for my daughter now that she's over 40 lbs.It's pretty expensive but it is worth it and I do like the harnesses. They are more secured and give me peace of mind.
2,Disappointed it doesn't work with older cars,I am very diappointed that the Britax Regent or Frontier does not work with older vechicles. I have a 98 Grand Prix and my car is not equipped with the top tether. I was told by Britax that this seat would not work in my vechicle and you HAD to use the top tether. So there went my two options for a 5point harness up to 80 pounds...Does anyone use this seat without the top tether?
4,HUGE Britax Regent Youth Seat,"This seat is HUGE. It holds up to an 80-pound child! This is not something you are going to want to move once you install it. I feel very secure with my little one strapped into this. We have a Honda Odyssey and had no problems with this fitting. My only qualm about this, and really about Britax in general, is that when you buckle your child in, there isn't always an audible ""click"" that lets you know it's secure. I just always double check but it would be nice to hear that and know you got it right."
5,Seems to be our last car seat purchase!,"We purchased this car seat for our oldest daughter, who is almost 3 & 30 pounds, so our youngest could use her sister's old Marathon! We have an Acura MDX (not a large backseat) and both the Regent & Marathon fit fine! The Regent is on our passenger side & the Marathon is backward in the center (our youngest is not yet 1). The seat is large, but obviously not too large to fit in our car. Our daughter still naps easily in it. We are hoping this is the last car seat we will need to buy!! Our only complaint is that the seat is a bit lower than the Marathon, but after thinking about it we realized this seat really is designed for children a bit larger (although her weight is within the capacity range of the seat). She can't see as well out of the window...it doesn't seem to bother her!!"
3,"Great seat, hard to keep clean.","I bought this seat for my daughter who is 4, it is a great seat, we really love it and it is super safe. I should have realized that the yellow on the seat would get dirty really fast. We don't eat in the car and the yellow is starting to go brown in a few spots. I have spot cleaned it and the fabric doesn't look nice anymore. So, my point is that the carseat is fabulous, the colors and lack of machine washing are a pain."
3,Classic Lifetime Movie,A girl marries guy that she doesn't truly know. He has a dark side that leads him to start raping women in their neighborhood. If you like Lifetime movies and chick flicks this is a movie for you. Not Oscar worthy but definitely entertaining.
1,Not the best!,"I don't know what I thought I would get, but I didn't get it. It was cheap! That's all I can say."
5,The Stranger Beside Me,This is a well made movie. It is based on a true story and the actors were great. You have a feeling of what is going to happen at the end although it take a long time for it to get to the punchline. It is a fun movie to watch with adults and teenagers. It is good for teenagers because they can see what dangers are out there.
5,Food for Friends:Homemade gifts for every season,"This book has so many fun and wonderful things to make for yourself or for a friend. I have made several of the recipes and have received ""rave"" reviews for all of them."
2,"A nice book, but still disappointing","I purchased this book after reading about it in this month's issue of Bon Appetit. The book contains many beautiful photos, but the actual content and number of recipes are rather sparce. In addition, I was hoping for some new or unusual food gift recipes, but there was really nothing - with the exception of a chai recipe - that I haven't seen in other books or magazines.The first section of the book is dedicated to packaging the gifts and ""The Art of Giving,"" a la Martha Stewart. I wish this portion had been removed from the book and more recipes added in its place."
2,It's all in the presentation. . .,"Disappointing. The recipes are mediocre with too much emphasis on liquor/alcohol, which neither my friends nor I partake in. For presentation purposes, well, Martha Stewart does just as well."
2,DISAPPOINTING,I found this book disappointing. There weren't really any new ideas for presentation that I hadn't seen before. There were very few recipes that actually appealed to me.
3,A good skin conditioner,"Its thick, and a bit oily. Could not use it as hand cream since I work in gloves. Do use it when i give myself a manicure, and the scent is not too overwhelming."
5,The holy bible,This is a book that help teens understand the bible better.... i believe that when teens are having hard times they have to read this
2,Never liked this Bible,"Perhaps I was too mature when I bought this Bible at the age of 16, thinking that it would minister to someone of my age. Instead, I felt like the questions/devotions were dumbed down and would be better suited for teens under the age of 14. I felt like the authors were being condescending, so I stopped reading the devotions after a while because they irritated me.As for the actual product, I ended up setting this aside for my old award Bible. The pages of this one were too thin and flimsy. The edges of the cover and pages got turned up and bent from being carried around in my backpack. Not to mention, this thing is a brick. Not only is it too big and heavy to carry around, but it looks intimidating, too.If you are looking for a devotional Bible that will really minister to teens, I recommend looking elsewhere."
2,not what i expected,i expected this to be like my NIV study Bible with the top half of the page being the Scripture and the bottom half being the explanation of individual Scriptures. it is not. there is not much of any explanation. i am very disappointed
5,Celtic art in the modern age,"Jim Fitzpatrick has got to be the master of the modern Celtic technic. His art can stand alone, but when paired with ancient myth as in this book Silver Arm brings these myths to life to modern eyes. Love the book and will buy anything published by him.The Silver Arm"
4,Somewhat Useful Book,"This is more of a review book than anything else. My chemistry class had covered all the information in the book except for ionic equations, and the book did not do a good job of explaining them. The book; however, does make an excellent review source, and therefore should be bought by those who are taking it. Annoying part of the practice tests are that there is no scale, so you cannot get a SAT like score, just number correct, therefore there is no way to tell how well you'll do. My recommendation is that you get the College Board's SAT II book, which has practice SAT II's for all the subject tests to see how the real test is like."
4,Long and Detailed Review,"The Barron's SAT II Chemistry book is extremely long and detailed and has tests that exaggerate difficulty. Each chapter does a good job of covering the core material but it also adds alot of extra information that will probably not be seen on the test. In fact, in the nuclear chemistry section, the book goes into sub atomic particles known as quarks, which havent been seen on the test in ages. The practice tests at first are very pessimistic and are quite difficult.Yet, if you do study this book completely, take the practice test and correct your answers, there is no reason you shouldnt get an 800 on the SAT II. I found the exaggerated difficulty annoying at sometimes, but, its a tough way of forcing you to do good. In short, if you have plenty of time to prepare for the SAT II, buy this book, and do it cover to cover. Your results should be wonderful."
4,A Book After the APs.,"This year, I took Chemistry and scored A. I decided to take the Chemistry SAT before I forget everything. I bought the Barron's Chem book and discovered that I didn't know half of the stuff. I look at all my fellow test-takers; they are juniors who have completed AP Chemistry. I ask myself: What am I doing here? I recommend the Barron's book for SAT Chemistry; however I recommend even more that you first take AP Chemistry before you take this SAT. It will really help."
5,Another winner from Barrons - 800 Guaranteed!,"Barrons has always been my preferred SAT study guide. A Clear logical, concise presentation makes it a breeze to revise for the SAT II Chemistry. However, it cannot replace study of Chemistry at the International Baccalaureate or AP level. It is meant, more to complement and familiarize the student with the nature of the exam than to replace classroom instruction.For the hardworking and diligent chemistry student, this book makes the difference between a 750 and an 800."
3,Not great but an o.k. book,"After taking a year of chemistry honors, I bought this book in order to prepare for the SAT II Chem. Since I haven't taken Chem AP, I had to cover some areas by myself that we didn't cover at school. I like the way how this book is organized. However, the explanations gave me a hard time understanding the material. Sometimes the book was unclear and contained too much stuff that was unnecessary. So, I wouldn't really recommend this book for its content. But one thing that's helpful about this book were its four practice tests. Actually those practice tests were little more difficult than the actual test. This allowed me to study the material thoroughly. I achieved a score higher than what I've expected and I think the practice tests contributed the most. (750 wasn't that bad after all!) This book can be helpful to you or it can be just a waste of money. So it's your decision!!!"
3,SAT II BARON'S CHEMISTRY REVIEW,PURCHASED FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD SON WHO USED IT WITH HIS TEACHER FOR SUMMER CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO PREP FOR CHEM SAT II; HIS COMMENTS: EASY TO FOLLOW ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN QUESTIONS AS THE PROBLEMS IN THE TEST
5,Top-notch Texas Blues,"Mark May is one of the best contemporary blues artists. His guitar playing is stellar: clearly influenced by Albert Collins, his style is Texas blues with a Southern flavor. His songwriting is witty, poignant, and more subtle than most of his peers. His voice is unique, sweeter, and more musical too. This CD has been at the top of my play list for the past two years. Every song is a keeper, the covers being played with a fresh approach and the originals bringing a new twist to familiar themes. This guy is a great blues player who deserves support!"
5,Simply Awesome........,"Back in the late 97 I visited Houston for the first time. Went out with friends to a bar, and Mark was playing. Met the band, bought the cd and got it signed....... 13 years later still playing it like it was yesterday......Thanks Mark for a classic!!"
1,Disappointed,"This was a interesting premise. But a lack of time and a budget, made this flick a disappointment."
1,Not healthy,I agree with everyone else. While my/your pigs might go bonkers over this product it's really because its the equivalent of junk food.I suggest everyone goes to [...] for proper care information on your piggies
5,Gpig Party,"I was hesitant to purchase this food for my guinea pig, Evelyn, but we are both very happy I did. She is crazy about it. We will be getting more."
5,Classic Red Green,These are some of Red Green's best shows. A must-have for any of his fans or fans of good comedy in general!
4,New Perspective,"This book takes ""Diets Don't Work"" a step further than the book by that name did a few years ago. I read the other book many years ago and it made sense but I was unable to follow through because I wasn't ready or didn't connect with the author. This book I think delves more into the psychological aspects of overeating and doesn't have the workbook stuff in it that wasn't helpful to me. Anyway, this author has a more authentic history of a lifetime struggle with obesity and, being the same way myself, I connected with him and have started to change my relationship with food like I never could before. He also has a website:www.thintuition.com. No I don't work for this guy but this the best book I have ever read that examines how it's not about what/how much you eat but why and how it is your mind and the culture that causes an unhealthy relationship with food. By the way, if you go to the website you can get a free E-copy of the book. Good Luck"
3,Messages from God,"Need lost of time to read this book, seems heavy....but come winter, when farm work is done, the reading will beginn."
4,Abandon all hope?,"I became a huge Ross Campbell fan after reading the Wet Moon series. This short, but sweet, graphic novel paints a beautiful portrait of genuine terror and fear amongst a rise of zombies. Unlike action films, all the scenarios in this novel feel true and are emotionally effective. The emotions of the characters feel real and you feel it right with them. One of my favorite things that Ross does with his comics is that he creates a visual uncomfortable silence to communicate things like tension and attraction. The panels Ross chooses to use without dialogue can set the entire moment for a scene about it happen.My only criticism of this graphic novel is that there is only one and it ends too soon. This suffers from something I call ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" syndrome. Something awesome that just ends without any true resolve. I certainly hope he doesn't choose to do that with Wet Moon!"
5,Horowitz - the best or real close to it,"Listening to this cd put me on a higher plane regarding beauty.There is no doubt that I will purchase more of ""Horowitz plays..."". And these preformances are relatively inexpensive. And for such quality, that is a rarity."
4,A CD for sumarize your Scriabin's record library.,"This CD is good for sumarize your Scriabin's record library because here you can find the most important pieces written by Scriabin. The music is good, but I think only Scriabin's fans enjoy it. The sonatas n 5 and 3, are very strong. Some preludes are like the sonatas, but the others are like Chopin's ones (but stronger). However, I think the best pieces on this CD are the etudes. They are the most important pieces written by Scriabin and you can see this when you hear them, because they are prettier than the preludes or the sonatas. When I hear this etudes, I think I'm going to cry. Horowitz's interpretation is fantastic. He plays Scriabin like anybody. About the sound, it's good, but I has got some imperfections (However, we have think that some pieces were recorded a lot of years ago -1,953 or 1,956-)."
4,The tithe belongs to the local church,"Gary North makes a strong case from the scriptures that the whole tithe belongs to the local church. North argues that the institution which has a monopoly on the sacraments is the institution that has a monopoly on the tithe, as it was in Abraham's day. The first half of the book makes his case very well. However, the second half of the book is mostly a criticism of R.J. Rushdooney's position that the tithe does'nt necesarily need to go to the local church. I felt that using half of the book to detail this criticism was unnecessary to his arument. I give tha first half of the book 5 stars, but the second half 3 stars. The first half is worth the purchase price and I recommend that you buy it for that."
2,Worth a listen --for non-French speaking...,"I sang with a chorus that performed this years ago and wanted an English version; I already had the Dutoit CD. Most of the recording was okay; the narrator was very good and parts of the orchestra. Unfortunately, the final movement just ""comes apart"". It's probably my favorite, and trademark Honnegger; I was so dissatisfied, I immediately had to get out the Dutoit and listen to the finale."
4,Wonderful moments,"The soprano soloist is the reason to buy this CD. Ms. Sorensson's sparkly, shimmery voice shines thoughout the album and brings the work to a glorious and perfectly in tune conclusion. The choral singing is adequate throughout and someimes exciting although it often has the blatty tone quality common to adult choruses whose women are asked to sing like little boys."
4,Good buy,"Is good for the price you pay! This thing is huge covered good part of my desk, may want to measure where you like your monitor and make sure it is either on it or off it, not half way. Where I like my monitor was only half on and half of the desk pad so I had to move it a little bit back. No biggie with a 25inch screen. Also this thing is dirt cheap quality but looks ""ok"". Deff not real looking leather but so dark that you really cant tell. One corner came up and off but glued it back down and now it's fine. Great for protecting your desk. Would work great with darker desk but a lighter desk may make the crappy leather stand out more."
3,fine for the price,This item is fine for the price - it's pretty durable so holds up well. The biggest gripe is that the edge of the mat is sharp so sometimes is uncomfortable to rest your arms on for extended periods of typing/working.
4,Professional look and a low cost,This is a very inexpensive way to make your office desk look fancy. I had no issues with the packing at all and you can write all over with no problems. A decent investment for the price.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"This product does the job that its intended for but I was hoping for something a little more jazzy. To be honest, if I saw this product on a store shelf, I wouldn't buy it."
1,IT STUNK,had that horrible plastic smell - couldn't get rid of it - wound up throwing it in the garbage - DON'T BUY THIS
2,Surface does not work well with optical mouse,Warning -- the surface of this pad does not work well with an optical mouse; you will likely need to use a mouse pad.
5,Sterling Silver case Swiss Watch,"Like the Sterling Silver Case and simple classic design. Goes with my seersucker suits and with my Khakis for church, or work. Keeps great time."
5,Recommend! Buy It!,"I have seen the future of rock and roll and thy name is ""Thumb Attack."" Perhaps this is overstating it a little bit, but you will do yourself a favor if you lend an ear to the 18 pulse pounding tunes included in this set. The many highlights include: the sadistic hate poem ""Personally,"" the country inspired and quizzical ""8 Ball,"" the top ten hit waiting to happen, ""Eleanor Roosevelt,"" ""On My Own,"" one of several songs about a relationship that didn't work out, and ""Gerund,"" about another relationship that is destined for failure. As good as the songs are individually, they work even better as a whole. At times, the sentiments dished out have the simple, faithful view of love often found in hallmark cards and at times this is countered with complex feelings that resonate with the complexity of a Thomas Pynchon novel. The combination works. Driven by the diverse talents of lead singer Bryan Cook, this collection of songs is definitely a diamond in the ruff."
3,Helpful to a student,"This version of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is part of the Oxford School Shakespeare Series. It is the copy that was given to my 7th-grade honors English class a few weeks ago. Though I found the story a bit dull at times (what normal middle-schooler likes a book assigned for school), most of the sidenotes in this version were very helpful to me. This book offers an exact copy of Shakespeare's play, as well as sidenotes explaining words that are not used anymore. It also contains a lot of background information on the characters and a brief synopsis. In all, I would recommend this version to younger readers and students, as it offers a lot of helpful tools for better understanding of the play."
4,Great value,"I shoot pro wedding videos. My setup is as follows:Manfrotto 516 headBogen/Manfrotto : 3273 Pro Quick Release Adapter Assembly (bought from Performance Audio of Salt Lake City)Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro Tripod Legs (Black)Pro Tripod Legs (Black)Glidecam 2000 Pro Stabilizer System for Medium Sized Video Cameras up to 6 PoundsThis setup, I must say, is phenomenal. I can shoot freehand, tripod (with pan capability), or glidecam. The quality of my videos has drastically improved since purchasing this head and legs.The head is fluid, and gives exceptionally smooth shots even when panning. The adjustability is great, and Bogen really thought out the secondary catch so your camera doesn't slide off the tripod once your release the thumb screw (you'll know what I mean if you buy one.)My only complaint is it gets a little choppy in cold weather (<35 degrees). See the work this setup shoots at [...]"
1,I dont know which I miss more: my time or my Money?,"First of all this DVD is nothing more than a video taped seminar David was giving to a bunch of senior citizens back in 2000...he was still using fractional quotes (rather than decimal) and spoke of 2001 as a distant future. David Silverman who commented above must be a friend of Mr Nassar (or an Alias) to express that this was money well spent. Nassar's information was cursory at best, the format was very basic, I honestly did not walk away with one nugget of insight. For this video to be marketed as current (2005) and at this cost is insulting (but the only fool here is me because I got taken). Even the ""blue hairs"" in the audience were bored--he probably lured them in with free food and AsperCreme just to fill the room and give the impression that what he had to say was interesting. Perhaps David decided to sell this video because his trading has not been going very well."
4,"Excellent, thoughtprovoking, but slow","I just finished it. It was a really great book. It is somewhat technical, as of course is must be, without going over the top.But not being trained in neither geology, chemistry or biology it was slow work on my part. 5-10 pages max. per sitting. Too much info to digest.But well worth the effort."
4,"A nice, peaceful sound","This is not the type of music I usually listen to, but I found it to be very calm, very pretty, and very original."
4,"excellent, but expensive","The book is without doubt the best ornithology textbook in existance. While this may be aided by the fact that it is virtually the only one there is out there, it is accurate, comprehensive and user friendly. my main problems are that it is starting to be a little dated, and of course - the price."
4,For all Bird Enthusiasts,"Wow! How our knowledge of birds has increased over the past decade since the last edition! Written with charm and warmth, flows well with loads of details; this book is a must for the shelf of every bird enthusiast whether professional or kitchen feeder watcher. Only complaint: I wish this Edition III had the engaging taxonomy section (at end) of the older editions, updated with all the new revisions in bird relationships hinted at in the previous editions. My copy doesn't have the promised CD of that section. The cover is stunning - out of the gloom of night comes a Barn Owl to pounce the author! - worth the price only. Some color photos of spectacular birds and their actions inside would brighten the inside."
4,good book,"It is more ""scientific"" that Cornel Lab's ""Handbook of bird biology"". Chapters 16 through 21 are the most iteresting for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Is is usefull for teaching on higher education level."
2,Beware of Buy-back Program,"I purchased this book as the required text for an ornithology class. I'm sure the book has some interesting information, but I did not find it useful. It is a bit out of date, at a minimum in the area of taxonomy. I did not open the book more than once, and it sat on my shelf for the entire course.My major complaint is now that I have sent the book back for a trade-in (at 1/2 the original value), I am told that the item is no longer in 'good' condition. It might be assumed that if an item is purchased in 'good' condition, and not used, then it could be resold in 'good' condition. This is not necessarily true.Beware of the buy-back program. Do not be lured into thinking that you will be able to recover purchase costs with a trade-in."
3,Deception,"A book written old style ; it means old pictures , no color picturesA book for ornithologues , not for birdersA book with many many details on molts , incubation , breeding , anathomy , .... but nothing on wings descriptionA book revised 2007 , but with nothing really new"
2,Thin Mat that ripped easily,"I just received this a week ago and used it for once 60minute session. When I was rolling the mat up I noticed that it was ripping already (about a 2-inch rip on the side about 4 inches from the end of the mat). On my second use I unrolled the mat to attempt to use it but unfurled/whipped it too quickly not thinking about the rip and the rip doubled in size. So now I have a ""brand new"" mat with an 8 inch rip on it. The mat was uncomfortably thin and did not have much grip for holding positions."
2,A good price mat but slippery,"I bought two of this mat for my Iyengar class, the price is really reasonable. but when I used in my class, it is so hard to do downward facing dog on this mat. very slippery. it looks like there is oil on the surface. I will just use them for the chair pose."
2,Wished I paid for more expensive mat,"There's something about it that I just don't look forward to using it.You definitely get what you paid for. It does it job but it feels flimsy and cheap and the pastel purple I got added to the cheap feel factor.I guess for me its a chore to workout and it would help to have something pretty to look at while I'm miserably holding a plank, but instead I'm staring at gridlines and an ugly color. I know for next time to spend the extra few bucks for something nicer. =P"
3,great price,"for an eco mat, the price is great, but two things: it's a little slippery, and you do need to air it out after getting it, as it does smell."
4,My Suprise Bonus,"I bought this CD because I wanted the Fantasiestucke to complement my existing Perahia version and, replace my elderly, overplayed vinyl Rubinstein copy. It's still the toss of a coin which I prefer, the Perahia deeply sensitive, the Rubinstein a joyful celebration of the music. It really depends on my mood. They are both wonderful. I got two bonuses, one small, one large. The small one was the Prophet Bird in a different recording to my old one. The big one was Carnaval. Carnaval was the piece which originally sold me on Rachmaninoff as a pianist and no-one had ever, for me, challenged his claim to the definitive version, not Annie Fischer, certainly not Michelangeli. Rubinstein runs him close. He may not have had the same all-consuming technique but, boy, he had heart. Listen, marvel, be excited and enjoy. The recording is good."
4,Very Insightful,"This book contains a lot of data and figures on the Ju/hoansi and is very informative and well written. The changes of the people, as well as their neighbors, are well documented."
1,MFC,"Save your money. It's mostly about MFC and there are much, much better books out there about MFC. The references to the .NET platform are too casual to be of much value."
3,Older book,"I used this for a course recently.Its was written for VS 2003 (not VS 2005). It does have a nice mix of MFC and some of the newer .NET. Judging by job ads, its time to get more .net, this is more of an introduction. I'm told finding a V C++ book on .net is a problem, as more people are moving to C#.The author has a newer book for VS 2005, which I might check out..."
3,Good,"I found this book easy to follow and it provided a great 16 chapter review of how to use VC++, (the first 16 chapters). Great for those looking for a thorough review with a couple of latter chapters even dedicated to using managed code, bonus!"
5,From a serious .NET rookie but experienced programmer,"This is one of the best C++.NET books I read. If you really want to learn; keep and buy ONLY ONE Visual C++.NET book, this book is for you."
5,Comfort Music from Amazon.com,"Autumn in New England is my all time favorite cassette/CD. I bought this on cassette many years ago and literally wore it out. I was thankful to find it available on CD. I find the songs charming, comforting and inspiring. If I'm tired or stressed or just enjoying good music on a cozy rainy day, this will always be ""the one"" for me to turn to."
4,Frederick Swann - Organist,"Frederick Swann is one of my favorite organists. He is a dynamic artist at the pipe organ and this CD represents his talents. Whether it is classical or religious music, he is outstanding."
5,Inspiring Alternative Education brilliantly depicted,"This book takes you into the heart and soul of an inner city free school. It's a beautiful human story about love and courage. It's also an excellent example of an ongoing experiment in real living and learning, real in the sense of actual, effective and happening. The school is free in two ways. You can go there without paying and rules are not prescribed. Chris Mercogliano does an excellent job of showing us both sides of this coin. If you're a parent, grandparent or soon to be a parent read this book!"
1,discs do not play,"I received 3 different sets of the ""Essential Classics"" movies collection as gifts. NONE of them play without skipping sections. I loved the concept of the set which is why I registered for them on my wish list. Truly disappointed in the quality of the product."
1,"You're kidding, right?","Essential Classics - Family Films? Wizard of Oz, NO argument there. But 'The Goonies'? What reviewer thought that was a family classic? It's good but there are so many other movies that are better (e.g., 'It's a Wonderful Life' - yeah I know it's a Christmas movie, maybe there should be another Essential set called Christmas Classics along with 'Miracle on 34th Street' - the original not the insipid remakes). And 'Willy Wonka'? It's kind of quirky classic, more of a cult film, if you ask me. I think someone ought to go back and put together another three movies better suited to the moniker 'Classic Family Films'."
4,"Great Movies, but Wizard of Oz is not in Spanish as described",I got the package because the description said the three movies were in spanish. I was surprised to find out that the Wizard of Oz has subtitles in spanish but is not translated to the language. I am dissapointed because my little boy (who does not understand English yet)wishes to watch the movie in Spanish.... Description of the movies should be corrected.
3,"Blade - excellent, handle - awful","I ordered this knife a week ago for a great price from Amazon. The blade on this knife shows Kershaw's quality through and through. Very sharp, matte finish and stamped with the kanji for ""wasabi,"" a nice asthetic touch. Overall, an excellent blade. The handle however, is a different matter. Not only was it ugly, a much deeper shade than suggested by the product photos, but it felt gummy in my hand. Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I don't like to feel as if I am holding a raquetball while chopping. Order a whole set if you don't mind the feel of the handle because these knives have great blades.5 for the blade 1 for the handle average of 3."
3,"Good knife, but not a great knife.","I wanted to try a Santoku knife, and the price was right for me to buy this one. The steel isn't bad - the stamped steel sharpens up to almost razor and holds an edge OK. I don't like the plastic handle. Since there is no bolster and this series isn't full tang construction, the knife has horrible balance.This knife is good as a starter santoku, but if you want a serious blade then I would suggest spending more money and getting a nice forged piece."
4,"Nice, but I prefer the DVD","This is the same selection of pieces (as on the Guitarra DVD) but, I suspect, different performances; at least they feel quite different (am I mistaken?). I liked the DVD versions better, even despite their being constantly disturbed by the narration.If you're curious, I'd start with the DVD (and maybe stop there). The CD's OK but there are better recordings of the same stuff, including by Bream of course."
3,"good, but too slow.","I went thru several Latin, flamenco, guitar of Spain CD's, and have same opinion of this one, not my type of music. Too slow, no recognizable melodies or tunes or songs. Julian Bream is no Hendrix, nor Van Halen, nor Satriani, nor Malmsteen. He is just a guitar player, I see nothing special in his playing... not on this CD atleast. If you are a hardcore/trainspotter fan of Bream, love solo guitar and elevator muzak, or just want to fall asleep, or have something to play at a funeral, then go with this CD."
5,collest toy on earth.,"This is the best so far.I have v1,v2,and I`m crazy for v3.You can unlock new idems,buy stuff,play games,tons of fun.Great for pet wanters.This will keep children away from computer habits,T.V habats ect."
4,I Love My Tamagotchis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think that having a lot of Tamagotchis is hard work but it can be fun. They are addictive, I just can't put them down. They have different kinds of games and you can buy stuff from the shops. One day I plan to have ALL of the different types of Tamagotchis."
4,v3s are the best!,i just got a v3 and they are so better than that v2 because they have sales and alot more stuff i think every kid deservs a v3 and it is edcicational because it shows you how to take responsibility!
5,Best toy Ever,This toy is great for kids to enjoy and my daught has been playing with it when ever she can.
4,Funtastic!,"This tamagotchi is pretty, and it's version 3! In version 3, you get to connect with tamagotchi version 2 or 3, and you can go online and visit the tamagotchi's grandparents and parents, travel, shopping for more stuff, visit the king, and lots more coming up! you can't do that in version 2 or 1. The little stick on version 3 is really for nothing, just a little decoration. But I think you really should get it before it's sold out! These get sold really fast, because they're so great."
5,So much fun !!!,I have this tamagotchi and it is so much fun! It's not that very educational but because you have to feed it and take care of it I guess you could count that as educational. This toy is really fun.I hope this helps.
5,how cool these toys are,"Tamagotchis are so cool i love them so much. i dont have one now because i lost it but i am trying to get one as soon as possible. Tamagotchis are so ""in"" right now that i cant find them at any stores including Target. Ive tried to call like every day but they always tell me that they are getting a new shiping soon but they never get it. if any one has one that they dont want put it on ebay and ill probrably buy it from you."
3,"A good, self published book!","This book, Walking Ivy's Path, shows that self published books can be very good to read. The book is well written and entertaining. Although it's ""fiction,"" I can tell that the stories come from truth.This is a nice piece of work that the author, Stella Cooper Mitchell, should be proud of!"
3,Left Me Wondering,"This is the first novel by this author I've read. I didn't realize it was a series of books. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on Amazon have already did that. However this book was a mystery to me. I have a feeling that it's a middle book of a series where it helps you get to know the character better. It had a lot of personal issues about the main character. You know who the killer is in this book however I didn't find him as smart, evil and fascinating as others. There are some political statements made in this book along with veiled statements about the Bonesmen of Yale. I felt the ending wasn't explained very well and that the religious significance of the killer wasn't explored. I wanted to like this book badly because I felt a connection to the lead character of the series. I think I will have to pick up the first book of the series to see if I really do like the book or if I was just fooled."
1,Disengaging and Disappointing,"I did not like this book at all. This is the first Keith Ablow that I read, and perhaps a part of my dislike have something to do with the fact that this is the fifth book in a series that was not named on the book's cover... But mostly, I didn't sympathize with the characters and the inclusion of the murderers P.O.V. sucked any mystery out of the book at all. And the ""suspense"" led to a very unsatisfying ending. Really, it was the ending that ruined it for me and the large holes in the killer's ""story""... some of his actions simply seemed impossible. I just couldn't find anything redeeming in this book whatsoever."
1,Threw the book away,If I want to read about one's political views then I would buy a book just about that subject. I do not care to have one's political views crammed down my throat in a work of fiction. I found the political bs so rampant in this book that I threw it away before I was even a third of the way done with it.Advice to Keith Ablow...find another line of work.
2,Liberal Series Fodder,"Ablow is ordinarily one of my favorites--but like many authors in fiction these days, they can't keep their anti-Bush politics to themselves. This book seems written with a major theme being that Bush is killing people to make the world a ""better"" place. Our Architect in this story does just that; and when we discover how sick and twisted he is for trying to ""better"" a family by removing its black sheep, we're supposed to realize the Bush administration is no different.Come on Ablow! You're better than that! This book is short--lots of double spacing, less than 300 pages, and dividing the story into lots of chapters. It's a political manifesto, nothing more. Clevenger doesn't change his relationships with his son, lover, or business partner. This book is stagnant liberal mumbo jumbo, written (it seems) just to keep up with a contract for the Clevenger series."
2,First time and last time reader,"This is the first book I've read by this author so maybe I'm missing something. I liked the idea of this book - it sounded like a great mystery. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The mystery takes second place to all the drama in the main character's life - I never got a good feel for the bad guy, why he became the way he did, how he continued to get away with it time & again, why everyone protected him. I didn't feel the victim's reactions were believable - they should have felt at least some pain or guilt over the loss of a semi-loved one. And the end just left me flat."
3,Wink! Wink!,"Just now heard of Mr. Ablow. Visiting my mother and saw it on her counter. Picked it up because of the title THE ARCHITECT. Sounded interesting.Like most of the reviewers I found it a page-turner, but a bit shallow in character development. Too many editing errors toward the end of the book, too (i.e., quotation marks in the wrong place) as well as too much use of the word ""wink."" Too many characters winked at Clevenger at odd times. Very fast-paced and fascinating tidbits about architecture. I'll read his previous books. Looking forward to the sequel to this...what happens with Billy, McCormick and Frank's sobriety?"
4,Special,"I have read numerous books in the Genre of Suspense and they are usually rarid reads that are harmless in nature. The Architect is different from most of the books that I have read. A great deal of this difference comes through the skillful work done by the writer whose traning is in the Field of Forensic Psychiatry. He is able to develop a character in Frank Clevenger who has richness as well as depth and is not like the typical lifeless figures that tend to be the creation of writers who have developed charcters for use in an ongoing series. The story moves along rapidly, under the direction of the author and is a most enjoyable read. One is able to appreciate the moves made by West Crosse, one ofthe best heavies that this reader has come across in a long time. The characters are anything but crtoonish and make this a truly special book to have read and one that I would recommend highly to others."
5,Nothing bad to say,"An architect does more than design homes for his elite clients, he rids them of anyone in their life that is causing chaos. He does this by killing them.I enjoyed this novel, it was well written and held my interest. An architect as a serial killer might not sound very promising, but Mr. Ablow delivers."
3,"Keith Ablow's ""The Architect""","Quite reminesent of the writings of Ayn Rand, I find his lastest book somewhat watered down as opposed to his earlier works. I hope he is not trying to be another ""popular"" crime writer thereby not focusing enough with regard to his remarkable ability to explain the complexities of human behavior, including his most important message, that the willingness to feel ones' own pain is the only way to heal.If Mr. Ablow needs a better proof reader for the numerous typos in this book, I am available."
2,Confusing,I thought the plastic bobbins were the round bobbins for threading the bottom side of the sewing machine. It's not. The bobbins here are flat plastic pieces to put leftover thread on.
4,good organizer,This works well to keep thread organized. It is easy to use and the price is right! I would definitely recommend this for any who wants their craft materials to stay organized in one place.
2,Doesn't stay shut all the time.,"It's nice to sort your items, but the cover isn't made well. I actually have never found a organizer that closes perfectly and securely. :("
5,Great organizer,This is a wonderful product and I may be buying more. Love organization and I have so many flosses that I use when embroidering that this piece works well.
4,Quite large,"This was quite a bit bigger than I expected it to be, although that turned out not to be a bad thing. I like the larger slot along the side, which is the perfect size to hold my bobbin winder."
5,works great,"just as it looks great!!!! Fast ship, just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure"
4,It Keeps Me Organized,"This is a great little floss box for a great price. I love how the floss cards are plastic and they feel very sturdy as I wind floss onto them. If you need a box for your stitching, I recommend this one. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because sometimes I have to work with it a bit to get it to close completely; but, as soon as I figured it out it wasn't a problem at all."
4,Nostalgia that entertains and comfortable,"3 wonderful MGM musicals at a great price together. Not the greatest MGM musicals but they're up there with the best. For sheer entertainment on a cold, indoors-type of day, these 3 musicals will warm your spirit with a stroll down yester-year. Memorable tunes, big screen name actors, wonderful color and dance numbers lend themselves to a superb product that's been remastered digitally to fit the big HD screens. If you're looking to replace old VHS tapes or just need 3 movies to fill a void, this disc won't disappoint you."
1,Never Received,I ordered item as a Christmas present and it is February 15 and I still haven't received it.
2,not so great,"I ordered this a week ago, when I got it and started watching the movies seven brides for seven brothers works fine but the other 2 movies only go about halfway through and stop playing. I checked to see if there were any scratches on them but there weren't any. The dvds are just bad I guess. It's too bad I don't think there's any way to fix it."
5,Great Review,This set is wonderful with the selections that were put together in this three pack of Musicals. All three are great classics and wonderful to watch over and over.
4,contemporary study of common-sense psychology,"The title of the book is, in my opinioin, misleading. It is not a philosophical analysis of psychology as a science or a field of research activity. Rather, it analysis common-sense (folk) psychology in the light of contemporary cognitive science and philosophy. To a reader interesed in this special subject, the book is an excellent overview of (and contribution to) the current state of the art. But if you buy it for its more widely promising title, you may be disappointed."
3,Witchfynde - 'Give 'Em Hell' (Lemon),"Originally put out in 1980, this was the NWOBHM band's first of (looks like five albums). To avoid any confusion,this is NOT Witchfinder General nor any sort of side-project or spin-off band of such. Witchfynde is, yet ANOTHER of those lesser-known bands from the late '70's to early '80's metal era. It's clear that this ensemble is somewhat influenced by Maiden. I mean, these guys MUST'VE caught Maiden at an extremely early concert appearance. Didn't Steve Harris and crew release their first lp in 1980? No matter, nothing too special here. Decent British heavy metal that never got their 'just due', I guess. Might appeal to fans of Mercyful Fate, Iced Earth, Venom and Bathory."
3,Bought it for the picture,"Thought I would try and find out what all the smoke behind mirrors is all about. From the hip the only song I can remember as being any good was the last one. The picture is worth 2 stars alone with decent vocals for one, but the music is not that amazing or stunning like pentagram's forever my queen in the seventies or captain beyond."
4,Good carrycase,"The hp case is very nice, the only thing I could think of to make it better is to have just a little more space."
5,love my pictures,"Great case Great price. I take my printer to parties,family get togethers and when i see my grandchildren. This case carries extra paper,ink and a few little odds and ends.So portable we took it on vacation with us to see my son and his family this case made it so easy for us to carry it all over with us and print the pictures to leave everyone with the memories we had on vacation."
1,Not Enough Information,I bought this book for the sole purpose of learning what I can do as an actor to mimic Damon's success and what does this book tell me? Absolutely nothing.
4,TomTom mount kit,Ordered this as an additional mount for another car and received it broken. It was promptly replaced with a working model and has functioned perfectly so far. I think the plastic piece inside the mount that was broken should be redesigned with some stronger material but other than that it works as advertised.
3,Will not stay mounted,"This replacement mount falls off every other day. The original one stuck so well, it broke coming off!"
2,Be Carefull,"Be carefull, make sure this is the upgraded unit, that came out recently. No reason to buy the old original one, because of many flaws in design."
2,Not all that,"I bought this CD from amazon based on the reviews I read. I was very dissapionted. This disc has a few hard-hitting serious D&B tracks(Maybe 3). The rest are all REALLY slow, ambient I guess D&B. A few are just straight up electronic jazz. I guess none of the songs aren't really that bad, its just that this album will switch gears so qiuckly its annoying. Disjionted, non-mixed, weak, and non-danceable from the constant change ups and beatless jass. Keep looking."
5,finite element procedures,I will say this book is excellent for FEA!But I want to know who can share the solution manual to me! It is useful for selfstudy!Finite Element Procedures
5,Excellent finite element text,This is an excellent text for students and practioners alike. The presentation is brief and to the point and focuses only on algorithms and techniques that have been proven to work. The problems are excellent and can only be solved if one understands the essence of the techniques presented. There are many textbooks on finite elements but none so thought provoking as this one. Definitely a must read!
5,Most valuable book,This is the only book I keep reading.This is absolutly the most valuable book in finite element method area for engineers and students.There is no doubt.Do not spend time and money to buy other books.
4,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book for both introduction on Finite Element Method and Numerical methods concerning solution of FEM Equations.This is an excellent book for both studying alone and for FEM courses.This is an excellent book for both undergraduate and graduate students.This is an excellent book for both fun and work!...Muito Bom Livro... recomendo!
2,Better know your stuff.,"It maybe good for the well versed FE student, I had it as a text in college and got little value out of it. I talks at a high level and never gives a undergrad a chance."
3,"Review of ""The Spirit of Freedom"" CD","Being a fan of martial and patriotic music, I have an extended collection of CDs covering this musical genre.Having read positive reviews of The Spirit of Freedom CD, I looked forward to listening to it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed, not by the performance of the Washington Men's Choir (Camerata), which was excellent, but by the incongruous musical accompaniment: A piano accompanying the Air Force Song (sung beautifully, incidentally) detracts from the dynamics and power of the piece - the same for the Marines' Hymn, et al.A brass band or orchestra would make all the difference - the thin gruel of a solo trumpet, drum, organ and piano for music such as this, is inadequate. With proper accompaniment this would have been a five star CD for me - instead of just a three."
2,Effete,"I bought the CD based on other reviews. The hymnish sound is OK for songs like ""America the Beautiful"" but I was hoping for more robust renditions of songs like ""The Marine's Hymn"", ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" and ""The Caissons Go Rolling Along""."
1,"Oh Please, Sneeze Already!,","I brought this home one day from the Swedish market and I played it only once, once was enough. Most of it is sung by people who can't sing, I think they should have hired a more worthy producer and instead of having some guy bang on a cheap drum, hired a crew of musicians. Looking at it, I noticed that the album was made in China by prisoners and I couldn't get a refund. I wouldn't waste any money on this considering its a [...] by a company to pull in a few bucks due to the patriotic fervor in America."
4,sturdy containers,"These containers serve their purpose. They are just the right size for my husband to take his lunch in. I did not give these 5 stars because when spaghetti sauce was microwaved in them, the stain became permanent and has some very bad melted spots on them. Otherwise, for every other food, they have worked out great."
3,Good Dumb Metal,"These guys aren't half bad as dumb Metal bands go. Their sound, especially the vocals remind me of Roadsaw one of my favorite defunct Metal bands. I don't know where they hail from but they also sound like many LA style rock/metal bands. I actually only downloaded 7 of the 12 songs but I might go back for more. My faves are Win or Die Trying, Texas City Texas, Speedball, Control Freak, Nascar (a very stupid, great tune), Lets Get High. ROCK ON and ON!!"
1,Not a very good spreader,"Bought this spreader hoping that it would do the trick when spreading grass seed. Very disappointed. Even on the highest setting, the coverage is inadequate. Better to use the ""throw it out by hand"" method. Plan to donate this spreader to Goodwill."
1,broke after two uses,"it worked well at the beginning. but after two uses, the wheel doesn't spin. It feels like some gear stuff was broken/loose in there. My lawn is about 1,000 soft. Fairly disappointed. I have thrown it away and will get a walk-behind spreader.if you have similar size lawn as mine, don't waste money on this hand held spreader. I have learned the lesson that when buying the tools, start with these in the middle of price range. It's quite certain that you will upgrade if you start with the cheapest choices -- they either break quite soon, or take a lot of muscle/time to use. You will end up to grade, for sure."
3,"Works well with some grit, not with salt",This works well as long as you are attempting to distribute uniform sized pieces of grit. Rough rock salt will jam in the mechanism and render it completely useless. If you spring for the more expensive chemical salts which usually come as pellets you will have no issue. Regular salt or seed or grit will cause no problems and will work as intended.
1,Save your $$$ and buy something else,"The width of the axle is too small, causing this to tip over with even a light load on even the smallest of grades. Mine tipped over, bending the frame making the unit useless. It's just built too cheaply."
1,This model is also the Statesmann II at Southern States stores,"I came here looking for a part for my unit, the same company makes the Statesmann II for Southern States & Ace Hardware stores, even though it is an Earthway product. My crossmember piece which attaches to the frame & the axle rusted after 1 year of use. Now I can't seem to find them or get the part to fix the thing... it seems they want me to buy another whole unit for another 59.99... nope not throwing 59.99 away every 2 years. I want something that is going to last 10 years or more the first time I buy it. This is not built to last more than 2 years..and I kept mine in a shed all winter too.."
4,"A good book, but too cruel","I am a great fan of Tony Hillerman's, and I think this book is as well-written as his others. The plotting is good, the characters are well-drawn, and the world he creates seems accurate (I'm a former resident of the DC suburbs). My only problem with the book is that, at times, it becomes too cruel. There's not really any unnecessary violence, or excessive gore. But there are some painful moments.Even so, it's a Hillerman, which means that it has a solid plot and good character development. Not the best place to start reading the series, perhaps. But worth a look if you like Hillerman."
4,It is a good book.,"Talking God which is written by Tony Hillerman. The book's setting is in New Mexico and Washington. In the stroy Jim Chee and Joe leaphorn try to slove a case about Indian Arthfacts. I think this book is good, but sometimes it is slow, but then it gets better. The author uses good detail of setting and characters. This thriller has so many good plot twists. I think you will like it."
1,don't like the ending of the book,"The ending are too obvious because every bad guy turned out to get caught by the good guy. I think the author should make it more realistic. It will be exciting if Chee or Leaphorn got kill. Also, make Jim Chee and Janet Pete come together as a lover not as a friend."
1,Same Old Stuff,"This is just more of the same old stuff. I've read several of Hillerman's past books, but it's been a while and I had hoped that things may have improved, but it's not so. It's the same old story, the noble, honest, intelligent red man trying to work around those immoral, dishonest, stupid white people. If you want the read about the real American indian, read ""The Wild Frontier"", by William Osborn."
4,An interesting mystery,"If you are a fan of Lt. Leaphorn and Detective Chee you will enjoy this story. When reading Hillerman's books, I look forward to learning more about the beautiful land and Navajo people. The setting for much of this book is outside of the Navajo reservation. Even so, I enjoyed this book tremendously and, unlike other reviewers, found it to be a fast read. I was captivated by the methodical methods used by the policemen in approaching their investigations. I felt as if I personally knew the main characters as I would a friend or neighbor. I enjoyed following the seperate investigative paths of the policeman and watching the police work entwine to solve the mysteries presented in the book. A good mystery with ""puzzles"" that require some thought. As an added bonus, the book leaves the reader with moral lessons to ponder."
4,No Bones to Spare,"Jim Chee must arrest Henry Highhawk for returning the bones of his ancestors to the tribal lands in Tony Hillerman's TALKING GOD. Henry's problem is that the bones were part of the collection of the Smithsonian where he was employed.Joe Leaphorn is investigating another case of a murder whose victim was striped of his identification.It isn't long until small threads of each as indicate that Nighhawk may be wanted by others who have no interest in police procedure.Nash Back, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,"Convoluted and lame plot, definitely not his best","I have been reading the Navajo mysteries for the first time, in chronological order. I was sad when each ended, and could barely wait to get the next one from the library...until this one. The plot is convoluted and far fetched with a LOT of holes, and I found the setting ugly and depressing, especially the character of the hit man. (This is the second hit man Hillerman's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama. Hmmmm...) I skimmed the last 4 chapters because I was tired of both the book and the setting...I just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because I was not enjoying the experience as I usually do.So as other reviewers have advised: don't start here!"
5,Talking God,"As always Tony Hillerman entertains and informs. Following Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee as their separate investigations intertwine is, as always, a compelling read. Unfolding the mysteries while walking in their Navajo shoes increases my reading enjoyment every time. I always look forward to this journey."
4,Hillerman Navajo mysteries,Reading one of these novels always leaves me with the desire to read another one. His plots aregood -- he paints pictures of the land and the culture and his characters fun to get to know.
2,I like this album- Just Kidding!,"Sorry folks, but there has to be at least a few bad reviews of these guys. Here's why: Mindless are pretty original but they aren't talented musicans! They suck!!! Take away the programed drums and all you have is Jimmy Urine's voice, the band's only asset. Which is to say that he can rap and squeal,- pretty much standard in today's nu-metal scene.So why are there so many MSI fans? Their gimic is that they combine all these styles- punk, rap, and various beats to make a sound that hasn't been mass-produced yet. Their problem is that they can't pull off a decent rendition of any of them. Add poor sound quality and you get a Cd that's interesting for a few listens but wears thin before you realize it has no substance."
4,"This is ""Tight - F***in' right""","...but not worth the insane amounts of money people are selling this for. I reccomend you pick up Frankenstein Girls May Seem Strangely Sexy as a first listen. And even still, just download this album. Anything more than 20 bucks a cd is overpriced. I love this band, but not ""115-dollars-a-CD-love-this-band."" < /rant >MSI is a nerd-goth-techno-industrial punk band. A must-listen band if you like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Dresden Dolls, Ministry, My Life w/ the Thrill Kill Cult, etc.I like this CD more than ""You'll Rebel To Anything"" but not as much as ""Frankenstein Girls..."" This has the same atari sound effect melodys, frantic drum and equally frantic vocals, and most importantly: this CD is full of lyrical phenomenons that bridge the nerds with the goths."
5,Good... Bad... they kick @$$ in concert and their album,"Ok, first off this is not coming from some sort of record promoter ploy for sales... i am an honest to goodness strait up freak who got the privlege to see this band in concert with ICP. They mix of tearing industrial based music with the mellow-at-times lyrics is defininently a sweet mix. This is comin from a guy who listens to NIN and such. Trust me all... these guy do royally kick."
5,Origionality,"This CD Is great. MSI has a sound that no other band today has. They're very origional and will get into your head. This CD is definately worth buying, but if you've never heard them I suggest you listen to some samples cause you'll proably be suprised by what you hear."
3,"Cheap band, great watch","I love the watch, the big buttons aregreat for timing laps in the pool, but...Band broke after four months of wear.Otherwise it would be a five.But what a pain to have the band break.Is there any way to fix these bands?"
4,This is my second OVA,"I had this watch before and it kind of died on me. It lasted for about 2 years before it did this. I've had a newer version of this same watch for about a year now and it seems to keep going. I think the issue with the old one was that I wore it when I swam. I doubt the chlorine was all that great for it. I love how the face is on the side of my hand. I'm so rarely looking at the top of my hand!ETA: Actually, I don't think my old watch died, I think it was just the battery. It's probably fine. My newer one did the same annoying BEEP of death and all I had to do was replace the battery."
4,I Just Love Martha Jones,"I love Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), but I agree with some other posters that a ""school girl crush"" on the Doctor is not a sufficient explanation for why she stays with him as he appears both hot and cold about their relationship.Martha is so smart and beautiful that it seems odd, whether Doctor Who is a Time Lord or not, that she accepts the Doctor's hard-to-get act regarding their personal relationship. I think the chemistry between Martha and the Doctor is excellent, but the problem is obviously with the writers who hesitate in writing a full fledged romance between the interracial couple.Season Four is currently on television and Martha's return has been recently broadcast and now she is supposedly engaged to a human doctor who is currently working in Africa; what a cop-out.Actually, Martha Jones (I love that name), is too good for the Doctor, but nonetheless the writers should have more courage regarding Martha and Doctor Who's romantic relationship."
5,The best series so far!,"Firstly I want to say that I didn't miss Rose, Martha is great as the new companion, secondly, I consider that this one is a 14 (counting the X-mas special) episodes long story arc, things and situations that happen in one episode are explained or are important in the series finale. We have here, the best Doctor and the best Master ever. Buy it and Vote Saxon!"
5,Best TV Series Ever!!!,"Dr. Who is an amazing show and this season features some of its best episodes, with the two part ""Family of Blood"", and ""Blink"", which is the best episode in the entire series. The entire season is well written and well performed and its definitely worth buying."
5,Doctor Who Series 3,Like the original Doctor Who the new one just seem to get better with each season. My only disapointment was the the Doctor who special I heard about wasn't included after the season final episode. Though that does give me hope that a fourth series might be done some day.
4,uneven season,"Season three starts off with a bang, and ends well. It drags in the middle though-- The Daleks take Manhattan is silly and overly long, and 42 is just lame. But ""Blink"" is easily the strongest episode of the new series, and the final three episodes rock. Well, the ""Tinkerbell-jebus"" deus ex machina was silly. But it otherwise the last three episodes really hold together well!"
5,Doctor Who - The Complete Third Season,"Our entire family are big Doctor Who fans from the seventies until now. The ""new"" doctor is great and carries on the tradition of good scifi for the whole family."
5,Brilliant!,"I don't even recall how I learned about this episode... seems someone mentioned it online somewhere. But the description read just like all the reviews here: the episode is clever, well-written, and stands nearly on its own. No need to know much about the Dr. Who story. Just watch and enjoy.It's particularly amazing that this episode is so suspenseful and scary, without any sophisticated special effects. A testament to brilliant writing and directing.I'm not much for watching movies more than once... but I have put this television episode on my short list of ""Shows to Watch Again. And Again!"""
3,the docor,bring back Rose Tyler. Rose was a great partner for the doctor. special effects and costumes of aliens really need work.
2,It's not a very good show,"Let's face it ladies, doctor who is just not a good show. Perhaps it's just too british for me but the smugness of the doctor just irritates me. Combine that with the terrible costume design and terrible graphics and it's just a jumbled mess. The best part of the show is the intro music."
5,The wilder the better.,David held his own. But then he had a companion who challenged him a bit. Love this episode.
5,Wow,"Having seen the other three series I wasn't sure if this series would live up to my expectations, but it has and I'm very glad I bought it!"
5,One of the best!,"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this episode. The Doctor is only in it briefly, but his presence is essential. The main character, Sally, is so good, she makes you wish she had become a companion. This is an episode where the Weeping Angels are truly terrifying. In The Angels Take Manhattan...they become more of a parody. They lost what made them terrifying. Or, maybe the story just didn't carry much weight for me. I cared very little for the two main characters affected and cared much more for the two I didn't even know in this episode. There are handfuls of Doctor Who episodes that are ""must sees"" and this is definitely one of them."
3,dr who,great series everyone should watch it once i think everyone should order this product from amazon its cheaper and you dont have to go to the stores
5,Great,It came fast and in great shape. My daughter loved it for her Christmas present. What a nice deal for us.
3,slightly disappointed,"I am not sure what the problem is, but I have bought season 2 and season 3 through here and in each set there was a damaged disc (one was completely scratched up) where it freezes partway into an episode and that whole disc is useless. The packaging was all fine, unopened and undamaged, so I am not sure if I am the only unlucky one or if this is common! It did come in the mail quickly though and like I said the packaging was fine."
4,Quite enjoyed but had problems with the product...,"I really enjoyed what I could view of this season...but had a couple of problems with the DVD set. First of all as soon as I opened it, the plastic holders for the DVDs fell right off the cardboard backing. More importantly, I had problems viewing two of the discs. The worst was for the ""Utopia"" episode - it skipped and froze and eventually I couldn't get it to do anything after a certain point. There were no scratches on the DVD so I have no idea what caused it. Luckily the sellers (vinnysvideos) were FANTASTIC. They've refunded everything and were very quick and understanding. I highly recommend them, but I'm just hesitant to buy another one of these at this point. :( Might have just been my bad luck, though. ;)"
4,Dr.Who? Review.,"As a Dr Who fan from way back, was delighted to see the new series on TV and having missed some of the episodes, most happy to see the DVD. Enjoy the humor, predicaments, and adventure of these somewhat mis-matched soul mates."
5,great gift,Daughter it was purchased for was very pleased. It brought the most excitement of all her gifts. Will probably get others in the series from Amazon.com for her birthday. Very pleased with the quickness it arrived before Christmas.
4,"Not Quite as Good as Series 1 and 2, but Still Very Good","The loss of the Rose character is felt. Dr. Who's new side kick is pretty good, but not as good as Rose.The Blink episode was awesome!!! Strangely, the Doctor was only in it a short time and not as the main character and mostly in the background.I really liked several of the other episodes as well, but some seemed to drag. I did think the ones with the Doctor turned human was pretty creative, even if it had some strange parts. Derek Jacobi was pretty good in the episode where he played - and the surprise revealed there was really something. Captain Jack returns and something interesting is hinted at there.The fourth series is set up well at the end of this one I thought. Dr. Who will get a new side kick - will be interesting to see how she compares with the ones before. I will soon see how things go.Recommended."
2,Beware of Roxborough Discount,"The Doctor Who series is fun but this seller needs to be honest about the quality of the product they list. I was told this was 'Used - Very Good'. 3 out of 6 discs had scratches that would not allow them to play. Somehow the seller had a 98% satisfactory rate but after receiving my product I found numerous reviews stating Roxborough makes false claims of the quality and never responded to customer contact. Add me to that list. No reply to my contact. They have an obvious zero customer service attitude coupled with take the money and run. Thankfully Amazon is better than that. Amazon refunded my money. Amazon good. Roxborough Discount, terrible. Don't trust this seller!"
3,"For a better viewing experience, skip Disc 3!","For those who have already read the more in-depth reviews below, and have also watched the whole series: on rewatching, try skipping Disc 3. We found that the series was much improved by the exclusion of these four episodes. Among other things, Martha is a much more interesting and strong character minus the additional whinging about her unrequited love for the Doctor. We enjoyed the series quite a bit more without."
5,An Example of Perfect Television,"It's odd that my favorite Dr. Who episode is light on the Doctor (my favorite Doctor, Mr. Tennant) but this is a special episode. It's probably in my top five favorite television events of all the television I've ever viewed. The pacing is flawless, the acting is superior, Michael Obiora is one of the most beautiful humans I've ever seen and I have had at least 5 Weeping Angels nightmares since I first saw this episode. There's something extra fantastic when, as a viewer, you can't see the monster move. The tension is nearly unbearable. I'm quantum locked every time I watch this episode; I can't even break for a trip to the toilet. Complex in a simple way and, even, a bit weepy in spots, it will enchant even those of you who think you hate speculative fiction."
5,A satisfying viewing experience.,I have enjoyed Dr. Who series since the 3rd doctor and the new series has been an excellent continueation. The series had stayed true the heart of the original with improved effects. It still relies more on the story line than on the special effects. Stories that have always brought me back. Well worth the the viewing time. And I hope it continues.
5,BEST SHOW EVER,"Doctor Who is fairly overpriced as series go (though not as bad as Star Trek, thank goodness) but WELL worth paying a bit extra for. However, I won't be buying series 3 from Amazon unless they drop the price--not when I can get it for much less elsewhere."
4,Different Release or...?,"While the content of the discs was fine, I was concerned about the packaging. It didn't come with a booklet and the text on most of the disc faces was misspelled (""Kast of the Time Loros"", ""The Lazrus Exoeriment"", etc), which either means it's a bootleg copy or someone at BBC or 2|Entertain was asleep at the computer and no one bothered to proofread."
4,This show jut gets better all the time,"The third season was so great. It was interesting to learn more about the Doctor and see him when he's vulnerable. There are several episodes where the Doctor has to leave everything up to Martha, his companion for Season 3. Fabulous!"
4,Almost Perfect But.....,"He is by far my favorite Doctor but I love any and all references to previous Doctors and prior companions. Sara Jane Smith was one of my all time best loved in the whole series and I'm glad they brought her back.The only reason I give this set four out of five stars is because it's missing the best part of the entire season....TIME CRASH!!!!! Where Doctor 10 and Doctor 5 meet for an 8 minute period. This should have been on the DVD set like it is in the UK version. We got ripped off! This was a great feature and I've watched it dozens of times on YouTube. Thank God for that site.Anyway if that had been included I would have given it top ratings. I like Rose but I don't see the intense relationship with her that most do. After all the Doctor was with Sara Jane for far longer. Are we to believe Rose is the only one he's ever cared for?No,....me either."
5,Resource facts for students and educators,"Published reliable information on Native Americans and their culutral contributions is hard to find. One of these authors is Lakota (Sioux) and has achieved his goal of collecting information to be used by all peoples about the First Americans. This book was first recommended to me by a friend who is an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and an acquaintance of Mr. Keoke. I develop and present presentations to both University and Elementary students and often have a dozen or more books piled up to pull together exact references for my presentations. This book accomplishes that same reference task for me plus more. The information and maps in the appendix are much better than many other sources."
2,Uneven Collection of B and Film Noir Movies.,"This huge collection of public domain, mostly b&w films, is a mixed bag. Worthy movies like Detour, Impact, The Stranger,and others found here, are included in countless other collections by different packagers. But this is the biggest of them all. While it may seem like a great bargain at less than a dollar a disk, more than a few of the movies are not watchable because of poor, noisy sound and fuzzy images. Mill Creek did not seek out the best prints to dump onto DVD. Also, not all the films in the collection are classic ""oldies."" Several are obscure dogs from the 1970s and later. Finally, locating a film in the collection to watch is a pain. Mills Creek did not include an index identifying the location of each film on the 60 disc. You have to thumb through the all the discs and read the contents on both sides of the paper sleeves to locate your movie."
5,Grab the popcorn and...,"enjoy some really great old movies.While I will admit I am a great fan of these Mill Creek sets and have all 4 of the 250 collections (Horror, Family, Westerns & Mystery) along with several of the 50 movie packs this set is by far my favorite of the group. The price is right and pretty much across the board the movies are fun to watch; though there are a few stinkers in the bunch and the quality though not the best always only adds to the ambiance of these great old movies. Top off 250 old mystery movies with great packaging and you have many memorable evenings of good old fashioned fun family entertainment.I you are a video snob and only want completely digitally remastered movies then keep looking because that is not what you are going to get with this or any of the sets Mill Creek has to offer."
3,A mixed bag.,"Although the quality of the films, picture quality, and sound quality are quite variable, this is still a worthwhile box. I would definitely recommend it at Amazon's probably temporary ""sale"" price, but not at the normal price.Additionally, as I read in another review, a disc was missing, while an adjacent one was duplicated. I've notified Mill Creeks support; we will see if they remedy the problem. It certainly isn't worth returning the set for one missing disc, as another sample could have the same problem(or more than one missing)."
4,Excellent value for money,"The films in this box are mostly public domain, and the quality can be variable, but at the price per film it really isn't worth seeking them out and burning them yourself. And there are some really good films in here; British Intelligence, starring Boris Karloff, for instance, or the wonderful Escape from Sobibor. Others are more B-movie fodder, but still fascinating and enjoyable, like The Black Raven with George Zucco, or Suddenly, starring Frank Sinatra - worth watching as curiosities if nothing else. There is the occasional piece of dross in there, but I can honestly say this was well worth the money."
5,Lots of bang,"I bought this used in March for under $40. This is one of the best buys I've ever made. It has everything from Sherlock Holmes and Dick Tracy to minor Noir gems like ""Kansas City Confidential"" and ""He Walks by Night,"" and even a couple of decent Tarzan films. The price seems to have gone up, but I don't think it is being produced anymore. Get it while you can."
3,DVD REVIEW,Not very interesting. Kind of boring. Did not stress more significant events about the holiday. Not enough music or any holiday songs
5,"GREAT to say, we're here to stay...","This Australian import-single is well worth money...all versions are included here... (instead of the London records 2-disc-set with the same songs EXCLUDING the extended instrumental!!!). This is a fine song which will grow and grow on you. It's gonna be placed in the classic New Order songs such as Blue Monday, BLT, Touched, Fine time and Regret... Very good dance/rock song... New Order at their best again."
5,Authentic Middle Eastern dance,"If you like music and dance from the Middle East, this is a grea DVD to ad to your collection or gift to a friend, I personally love all of the Music produced by Adam Basma and his shows are wonderful, beautiful costumes, great music, fun, traditional and authentic coreographies."
5,Excelent Movie,"I saw this when it was aired on Cable TV, and ordered it to send as a gift to a family member that would like it"
5,Best movie ever,I simply love this movie and the message it sends. Learn to know your family and love them while you have the chance.
5,Excellent!,"This is an amazing movie, very touching and emotional, and something I think all of us can relate to on some level. Highly recommended, and well worth three times the selling price. This movie was shown on the Hallmark channel when I first saw it."
3,"Excellent musician, mediocre recording","There is no doubt that Julian Bream is a great guitarist. But in a concerto, even a great guitarist needs an orchestra and conductor that is highly attuned to their playing, not subservient, which seemed to me to be the case here. Worse yet, this is one of the most poorly sound mixed recordings I've heard in a long time. At times the sound of the guitar was so low I had to turn up the volume, only to have the orchestra come blasting in at high volume. The mix is so poor that it calls attention to itself and detracts from the music. A player more ""in concert"" with the conductor and orchestra, and mixed more subtly and effectively would produce a far better recording, no matter how great Bream is."
5,guitar symphony,I love this music and it came to me very quickly and in very nice condition. Thanks for the quick turn around
3,Lots of Promise!,"What a really like about ""Devil Moon"" is the author's sense of humor. The chapters are headed with quotes from either Shakespeare, Dorothy Parker or Mae West as appropriate. That combination in itself is humorous. There were literary quotes all the way through that were great. One character speaks of writing a dissertation comparing Chaucer and Steven King, which had me laughing out loud. It was not in snooty academic way but a tongue-in-cheek witty wisecrack sort of way. The characters could use a little work but the the book is amusing and worth the time to read. There is a lot of promise here."
2,Disappointed - Didn't finish,"I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this book. In fact, I couldn't even make myself finish it. I thought that both the main characters were too shallow (for me) to find any way to care about their story. On a positive note, the author did do a good job with describing settings well enough that I could picture them in my mind."
4,Devil Moon is a delightful escape,"What a delightful escape this book is. It's full of fun characters we grow to care about and an interesting plot full of twists and turns to keep us reading. The romance between our two main characters, Maddie and Phil is sweet and sizzling. The villains are despicable and cause enough obstacles to keep Maddie and Phil on their toes. I especially liked how the two young girls Melissa and Reba showed their strength and intelligence to overcome the awful situations that they were in and help Maddie and Phil at the same time. A fun and satisfying read!"
3,Cute,This was a cute story. Some parts felt a little rushed but over all I liked it. The main characters are likeable and fun. I wish the meaning behind the moon was explained and the reason why everyone seemed to be having the aame ghostly hallucinations
5,fun!,This was a fun easy read. It was a very predictable romance novel. A good way to spend a rainy day or pass some quiet time.
5,"A brilliant ""Ernani""","I am a strong admirer of the opera recordings produced for RCA in the 1950s and 60s by the late Richard Mohr, with Lewis Layton as his engineer, and this Ernani is one of my favourites. The stereo sound is excellent on my equipment - the ensembles and louder choral sections congeal a bit, but that was how things were in 1967. However, the solo voices are caught superbly and what voices! Bergonzi and Price were at the peaks of their careers, and both offer masterclasses in great Verdi singing. The underrated Mario Sereni gives what for me is his finest recorded performance. Maestro Schippers keeps eveything moving and shows consideration or the superb cast he was given to work with. Yes a great Verdi recording!"
5,Amazon's misleading editorial reviews.,"I have noticed that many of the editorial reviews for the recordings of Leontyne Price are ""mixed or equivocal"" in nature. I have not observed this phenomenon in connection with reviews for any of her great contemporaries (Sutherland or Nilsson).What gives Amazon? This recording is so much better than any currently available alternative in regards to sound, musical accuracy, and completeness that it is nearly self-recommending. Leontyne Price not comparable in Verdian style to Bergonze - on what basis does Amazon's reviewer make this claim. Because to me it seems offensive. And the off-handed dismissal of Domingo (without any explanation) is pretty insulting as well."
5,OLDIES AND GOODIES,Pick a snowy nite and this could be the start of a beautiful friendship where frankly my dear you don't give a damn.Entertaining viewing...play it again...
3,"Great Movies and Price, but awful packaging!","I have to agree with previous reviews that this was a great price for three great movies, however, I was very dissapointed with the packaging. It appears that they took discs from the single sets (that probably were not selling) and repackaged them into this disc. I tend to be very meticulous with my packaging, and it bothers me that the disc for Casablanca says DISC 1, but there is no DISC 2. In addition, when you unfold the packaging, GWTW and CASABLANCA have ""pretty"" discs, and then you have the ugly clear faced disk for Zhivago.It is true that if all you are looking for is the movie, then this a great set, but if you like packaging as well, buy the individual movies."
4,3 classics in one,"I love the quality of the reproductions. Gone with the Wind is 2 disks, that is good, Casablanca is one disk, and why would they put Dr. Zhivago on a 2 sided disk? Couldn't the producers of this set put Dr Z on 2 disks also for those of us who store our disks in a machine?"
3,Convenient,"This is a very nice product for its intended use (albeit one that is rather similar to many others marketed elsewhere). However, please bear in mind a couple of subtleties that may not be obvious from the item description:(1) The length of the hose is measured at its theoretically full extension. However, the hose never actually reaches this full extension because of elastic resistance (i.e. the very same ""spring"" effect which is the reason you presumably bought the hose) and torsion along the length of the hose as it is stretched. My experience is that you lose approximately 25% of the hose's length to these two effects. The only way to beat this is by making sure that the hose's rated length is that much LONGER than you need.(2) Make sure that you have the appropriate adapter permitting you to attach the hose to your faucet. Designer faucets, faucets with hose attachments, imported faucets, and outdoor faucets all may have trouble working with this hose out of the box."
2,dont plan on washin your car with it!,You get no pressure with this hose..good for watering plants with mist. Thats it. If that is your use..buy it. Its perfect and is great not to have to haul around the water can. Also the wand is nice so you dont dump water down your arm.
1,Pretty Flimsy,"I was really excited about having an easy watering solution for my front porch plants; this turned out to be pretty disappointing. First, it cannot handle the pressure of an outdoor faucet - why they even bother with pretending you need an adapter for household faucets is beyond me - it can only (sort of) work at indoor faucet pressures, so why not just manufacture it that way. Second, the overall construction is VERY flimsy; had I not returned it, I seriously doubt it would have held up for any reasonable length of time. Lastly, the adjustable tip was a joke - all it did was change the direction of the poorly-defined spray pattern (perhaps because it couldn't handle the pressure, but I tried it with my faucet set at barely a trickle with no better outcome). Great concept, but this one's not the one to get."
1,Not as pictured,The product photos show a metal connection piece to attach to the faucet. Mine was plastic and broke after a couple of uses. Would not buy again.
1,"1/4"", slow, flimsy, leaks","Title says it all...Wrong product description (I believe the small diameter of 1/4"" instead of 3/8"" accounts for the slow output).I am getting a different one. I am sick of using this."
1,Faucet sprayer,"It's a great idea but a lousy follow-through. The hose connection at the faucet has a plastic ring. If the water pressure goes up, as when you turn on the water, the pressure will blow the hose out of the ring."
1,Worst thing I ever bought ... period!,"Impossible to attach to faucet: too loose, water squirts out around the fitting; too tight and the washer at the end of the hose crimps and is squeezed out of the fitting. And there was no 'just right' between 'too loose' and 'too tight'. Just threw both of them away -- they weren't even worth returning."
4,easy apartment watering,"Plastair SpringJet 50-Foot Coiled Water Hose and Wand Set, Ocean Blue #PUJ250B93OTI live in an apartment with no outside water spigot. I have both indoor plants and an outdoor garden. I was lugging a gallon watering jug to water all my outdoor plants, and it was taking over an hour to get it all done. First, I ordered the hose with the wand and it was alot easier than lugging all that water outside and watering the indoor plants was a breeze. I just hooked it up to either my kitchen faucet, or the one in the bathroom. I have since added another plastair product the 50 ft water hose. Love them both. I store each of them in a plastic bucket so carting them out of their storage space is easy and easily stored. They are not heavy. I haven't had any leaks, or wetspots on my carpet. Great because I drag them through to house to go out front and then through again to the back garden."
2,Sandbag,"The sandbag served its purpose. However, what you can't tell from the picture or description is that there is an opening at the top of the bag with no way to close it. I assumed there would be a zipper or something similar to keep the sand in! I ended up doubling the fabric over and using a safety pin. Not ideal, but we made it work. If I would have known, I would have paid a little more for one that closed up."
2,Very expensive for a little book,"This is a good book, interesting, great pictures, but silly me didn't look at how many pages it was before I bought it. From the price of it, I assumed it was one of those big encyclopedia type books. But it's only 48 pages, similar to a storybook. Not worth over $20 IMO."
3,"good, not great","I read the reviews on this before heading out to the store and was disappointed after finishing the book. The first few chapters took about 5 minutes to read, not much in them. The middle of the book was entertaining but nothing exciting happened. The last few chapters had all the activity but for having read 200 pages of blah storyline the last 100 pages really needed to be more than they were. I do not regret reading it and I may pick up another by the author, but I was disappointed in this book, I expected more!"
1,Please save your time and money,"Do not waste your time on this book. It is poorly written, the 'plot' makes no sense, the characters are so unlikely and unlikable. It's hard to believe that this author has had 3 books published! Who is her following? I can read anything and do love a good, or even a really bad, novel as much as the next girl but this book is boring and unengaging. The only reason that I finished it was because I was stuck in a hospital waiting room with nothing else to do. There are sooo many other chick-lit writers and romance novels out there - treat yourself right and don't waste your money on this."
2,OK light read!,"Not a complicated or earth-shaking plot and definitely over-simplistic characters, but this was in line with my expectations from the other reviews.What keeps the book entertaining is the funny writing (the duvet cut in two) and the array of characters - LA fashion shark, cool bartender, slutty best friend, boring ex-fiancé, embarrassing mum and hysterical bossy sister - it is a welcome change from the typical ""2 female best friends and 1 gay best friend"" you usually come across with this kind of book.The story is about a young woman who is breaking free of ideas other people have about her, and starting anew.So, okay, she succeeds a little too easily in love and in her career, but the reading remained enjoyable. Or maybe my day was just bad."
5,Great Book!,I got this book as a gift from a friend a few years back and absolutely loved it! Very entertaining!
5,Dhyanalinga,"Jaggi Vasudeva takes us on His journey through 3 lifetimes to establish the temple in Tamil Naidu. Wonderful poetry, history, pictures and much more. A must have in your spiritual library."
5,Brilliant combo of theory and practice,"What I love most about this brilliant, original work is the way Schneider manages to think beyond the usual programmatic feminist notions that have become so dated, even reactionary, and yet do so without sacrificing her passionately held feminist politiccs. It really is a tour de force, and will interst anyone intersted in the representation of the female nude in art, pornography, and in theatrical performance."
3,Explicitly Misleading?,"Schneider's topic is both controversial and compelling, and for that I applaud her efforts. Her strongest areas of analysis and discussion in ""The Explicit Body in Performance"" include performance vs. pornography and the artists Carolee Schneeman and Annie Sprinkle. Schneider is far less effective in examining the tenuous topic of race and the explicit body in performance--and perhaps understandably so. Race is a difficult area to tackle on its own, and much moreso when it is paired with the notion of the explicit, racially-marked body in performance. Much stronger analyses of this nature do exist--coming from such performance theorists and cultural critics as Coco Fusco and bell hooks. Still, ""The Explicit Body in Performance"" is a book worth reading, particularly for avid fans, students, and scholars of women's performance art."
1,DONT BUY!!!,"wrong, wrong, wrong!!! lifetime warranty is a joke!!! Customer Support is terrible, and you pay as much to fix or replace it, as you would to pay for a new one!!!!"
1,The author should write but not read his books.,I grabbed this audio book for a recent trip and soon tossed it aside because the author read his own book. He rushes through the text and does not enunciate clearly. I doubt that I'll ever try the print version because what I did hear was more about the criminal & the crime than the workings of the DA's office. It's possible that this changes later in the book but I didn't get far enough to tell. The author should seriously consider hiring a professional reader like Scott Brick if he decides to offer any more audio books.
3,"Worth seeing once, but pretty bad","The cheese factor on this is pretty high. It looks like something a film major could have made with a group of friends over a long weekend. It's sort of embarrassing when Lash Larue, a former ""star"" of the silver screen, comes to the rescue of this group of pathetic 'tards towards the end of the film. Without him, it probably wouldn't be worth seeing though. He's got some mighty fine whippin' skillz! I believe there's only one scene of nudity, and it's nothing to write home about, so don't buy it for that. There's a pretty surprising racist overtone throughout the film too, so just be prepared for a little bit of that if you check it out."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!MOVIE SNORE FEST,"There have been low budget movies in the past that I've enjoyed,this is not one.The scenes with Lash LaRue and his whip made for some laughs,especially considering he had to been about 80 years old at least,but that was it for me.The makeup and effects consisted of some cheap masks and makeup bought at a halloween store.Boring and stupid in a really awful and lame kinda way.I couldn't bring myself to watch past the first 25 minutes,so I fast fowarded to the last 5 minutes to get it over with.Stay away from this Z grade boring mess.I'm not going to bore you any longer with details of this piece of poops storyline and plot.Your better off spending your 5 bucks on stocking up on toilet paper."
4,LASH!,"If you're into following the acting careers of never was-s, then follow that of Lash La Rue. His only claim to fame is the whip. His acting sucks, and in this it appears he's had a stroke, which is kind of funny. I recommend this piece of garbage to anyone who likes movies with no redeeming value."
3,...and something better comes along,"My suggestion? Skip conformist biographies and explanations of Hitler if time is short and read the one book that provides the necessary insight and understanding of Hitler that is found no where else: R.H.S. Stolfi's 'Hitler: Beyond Evil and Tyranny'.Oh yes, my friends......read this book! It is a biography of the Fuhrer like no other. It is the one book that needed to be written."
3,Understanding Hitler,"The only thing one can fully understand about Hitler, was his quest for additional Lebensraum. After all, a people of 85 million were confined to an area roughly the size of Montana, with limited natural resources. In this he followed international tradition from the beginning of time."
1,Biased western propaganda,"The usual biased western propaganda that keeps getting trotted out, and nothing original so would give it a 1 out of 10."
4,Outstanding Tool,"I have had this hammer for about two years and it is a fantastic tool. One description would be POWER, this tool has it to spare it eats up concrete like butter, one inch holes all day no problem. It is also an excellent tool for small demo jobs like taking tile off shower walls and floors too.Power and durability I give it 10 stars, On the down side: vibration is major and there is no lock on switch for hammer only mode, outside of that excellent tool."
5,Surprised to find,Gift for my daughter was a big hit. She is a great James Dean fan and was quite surprised by this DVD. Said she didn't know he had a TV career.
2,Difficult read,"I can't argue with the fact that the author knows his research material. The problem is that the book is so full of examples, that it makes for a very difficult and painful read. There is no flow, no voice, just examples. And I mean multiple examples in one paragraph. No real analysis, just a compression of facts and other information. This would have been better off as a bibliography and not an attempt at an actual book."
2,Holmes series,"Edward Hardwicke is the perfect narrator for the Holmes series--excellent performances 5 stars. However, Amazon has a great deal of duplication of content in CD Sherlock Holmes different titles for the packages. I found it maost annoying that have now purchased several duplicate stories in order to get a the ones I want--Zero stars."
2,Earthway Salter OK,"I purchased this thinking it was of better quality than the smaller blue Earthway salter. Sadly it isn't. It did arrive quickly ready to go, but after using it I'm not thrilled. It will now serve as my back up, it doesn't seem to want to move all that well when its full, and it feels kinda cheap. I'm sure it will be just fine for residential or private use. But if You own a business and need to use it for more than one or two accounts, I suggest to purchase a Salt Dogg, or anything with larger wider wheels, and one made of heaver metal.2/11/2010This thing just fell apart on me last night, wheels and gearbox fell apart. Don't count on it to last if you have to do a lot of work with it. If its just your house it will probably last for a while."
1,Worked for one year on my home then fell apart.,"Word nice for one winter after they replaced a flat tire but beginning of this winter it just fell apart. Epic fail. Note, this was only for personal usage."
3,No rock salt!,"This spreader seems well made and probably works just fine for seed or fine-grained fertilizer, but it does not work for rock salt. The company does have a label in the hopper recommending granular ice melt and discouraging rock salt, but I wasn't sure why. Now I know. The feed holes are too small to handle the coarse salt grains of typical Morton safety salt. It's a huge struggle, and even with continuous agitation by bumping, rocking, jostling and some swearing (which doesn't help), the spreader still can't lay down enough salt to be effective. But, I'll keep the unit and use it for grass seed -- but next winter I'll be looking for a purpose-built rock salt spreader."
5,The Great Tex,My son and I have been searching all over for Tex. When I finally found him on Amazon.com I was thrilled because his birthday was coming up. You should of seen the smile on his face when he saw Tex. He has these really cool horns in the front and I am happy to say they have really held up to this 4 year old's test.
3,great addition to collection,This is the only one of the Cars die-casts that I have had trouble with in terms of durability...I found the horns on the front-end come off very easily. This happened the day we got it! They go back into place well but I do not expect them to stay there if there is rough play.Otherwise Tex is a unique and fun addition to our collection and I would recommend him. He is too big to be used on any of the Cars raceway sets however.
2,No that great,"The book is a good attempt, but a lot is missing, such as diagrams, pictures and more specific ways for drills."
2,Promising title ... disappointing contents.,"Watching Tiger hit 360 yard drives on TV, you can't help but think ""Wow, wish I could do that"". So when I heard about a book titled ""The Tiger Woods Way - Secrets of Tiger Woods' Power-Swing Technique"", I rushed out and ordered it from the States.While there are some interesting observations on Tiger's set up and swing listed in the book, I thought the book came up short. It is 160 pages long, but the essential contents could have been condensed to a ten page magazine article. As for pictures ... well there aren't many of them. It has sequences of Tiger's Driver and 7 iron swing from the front view but none from the down-the-line view.Well, did the book help me gain extra yardage? After all, that's the only reason anybody would buy this book. I'd have to say no. For an average player looking for extra 20 yards off the drive, I'd suggest a visit to a golf pro and learning what is fundamentally sound rather than trying to copy Tiger's idiosyncracies."
3,better than average but missing something,"Berry Gordy&Motown would try any kind of Cover or give there Own Salute to a Artist or Act with this kind of Tribute&as usual there would be some Good Songs&then there would be some real Dogs.this is no exception to the rules.""Alfe"" Stevie WOnder's Version is Nice as is ""Raindrops keep falling on My Head"" by the Four Tops but needless to say nobobdy matches to Me what Burt&Dionne Warwick were able to get through.good for Collectors but not quite a Must have."
4,Excellent book!,This is one of the best Vietnam air war books I've seen. It has great photos and graphics and covers the air war in a thorough manner. No military historian with an interest in Vietnam or airpower should be without this book!
2,Gives Clinton a pass,"Bob Woodward's book is well-written and does provide some sense of the depths of Clinton's dishonesty, but it fails to fully expose the man, the way Isikoff did in his book. Our President is a vicious, abusive sociopath and deserves to be in jail, but Woodward makes it seem as though he was a victim more than a perpetrator. He does shed some light on the Starr investigation and the process that led to impeachment. If only Monica had been more forthcoming, if she hadn't shaded her testimony to protect Clinton, things might have turned out differently. If the media hadn't ignored Juanita Broaddrick anf forced Clinton to answer her charges his approval ratings wouldn't be as high as they are. Woodward doesn't really try to expose Clinton;like Monica, his loyalties are clear."
2,Not vintage Woodward,"As a loyal Bob Woodward fan of long standing,I regret having to pan his latest effor ""Shadow"". Just as the author whetted ones appetite in learning new and fascinating facets of Ford,Carter,Bush and Reagan..poof! the chapter was finished,and fully one half of the book was a re-hash of every newspaper article,tv talk show and endless repetitions of what we already knew,saw and heard.Maybe it's time to seek out Bernstein to hop aboard.Isikoff is still the champ in this genre."
2,Fading Fast,"Poor Boob Woodward is fading fast. This isn't investigative journalism, but an in depth look inside the head of a Washington insider - Bob himself.Woodward sullies Gerald Ford, calling him out of touch due to his lifestyle of golf tournaments and chartered jets, etc. I assume Bob is living it up in the hood somewhere, right? An ear to the ground while donning a backwards cap, eh?Bob also cracks on George H.W. Bush for not finding happiness. Is this man a shrink or a journalist?What happened to reporting? This book reports little, but shows a lot. Such as how the chattering class in D.C. is so connected that we rarely hear anything contrary. Matt Drudge dumped this book in the trash on his show and was right to do it.Poor Woodward, he used to be on top of his game, the best in town, but now he's fading fast.In fact, he's a shadow of his former self."
3,"Good, but enough with your Watergate legacy already!","Bob Woodward writes a nicely done book. He lays out facts and fills in the gaps with seemingly authentic dialogue. However, this is another example of his not allowing us to get over Watergate. He made his reputation on Watergate and he apparently will die before he will allow people stop hearing about Watergate!"
2,disappointing,This book is just a rehash of all the scandals that took place under the last five presidents. Not very enlightning!
3,Tedious,"I labored to finish this book; maybe I'm on overload with the whole Monica-gate fiasco. But I went in interested in the ""real"" story and came away feeling empty. The ""conversations"" between the principles were contrived, and I wonder how many of them - Carville, McCurrry, etc.. - would actually vouch for the integrity of the content.Woodward is milking this controversy for the almighty dinero.Can't recommend it."
5,"Awesome, if somewhat biased.","A tremendous book. Mr. Woodward does comment on events that occurred in a writing style that seems to be factual when in reality they are often his opinions. But that is ok, the information and gossip in this book makes up for any perceived bias by the gifted journalist."
4,Sources ?,"I thoroughly enjoy books about politics and history and have been fortunate to read tow great ones in the past week. Rustad's ""The Triumph and the Glory"" is the greatest war novel since ""The Bridges of Toko-Ri"" by a fellow named Michener. Then there's Woodward's new book, ""Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate. It is fascinating reading, but one should be cautious of accepting alleged conversations which don't have verifiable sources."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"After hearing the author speak, I had higher hopes for his latest book but alas, it was an effort to even finish it. It seems that he strings together numerous anecdotes under the broad umbrella of post-Watergate affects on the Presidency but he can't pull it off. Skip this one."
2,Its Not what it appears!,"This book is not what it appears. It is a defense of Woodwards assesment of Nixon and watergate and attempts to imply that this is what brought down Clinton. THAT IS NOT THE CASE as Clinton was not only a lier but clearly immoral. There is no way Mr. Woodward can cover his Political leaning with this type of story. When you read this book it clearly is 50% Clinton and defending his and Hilary's actions under Whitewater and the Clintons' misconduct in the Whitehouse as President. In all fairness to Mr. Woodward this book is far below his standard of fair and honest reporting. Let admit it, this is no more than a defense of his reporting on Clinton and Nixon."
1,Liberal Press Finger Pointing With No Answers,"Bob Woodward, revered for his work in breaking the Watergate scandal, tries to take the higher ground and make a mockery of the Presidency. Never once does he suggest the press went too far and not once does he offer a solution to the downward trend in the Presidency that he writes of. This book is all commentary with interspersed quotes to make the uninformed reader believe Bob Woodward's views to be fact. To the reader beware...check your history books and keep your mind sharp. Anyone can point the finger--but the truly good book would offer a way out, a way forward, and a fair look at each of these men and the treatment they endured at the hands of a liberal press."
1,LIberal Drivel,Woodward writes like people actually care. This opiionated pamphlete sheds no light other than Woodward's personal coffers need filling. The long and short......Woodward knows no more than one can get from reading newspaper.
3,Good brief history of post watergate presidencies.,"Mr. Woodward's book gives a brief history of scandal's and the presidency since watergate. He also does a good job of showing that good scandal management requires disclosure of the facts, and allowance of an outside investigation (these are the ""two fundamental lessons of watergate"") But, the book focuses too much on the President Clinton scandals, only to conclude that they were of a totally different essence than Watergate was. He spent too little time discussing Monicagate, and too little time discussing Iran-contra. Good book, just not a great book."
2,Enough,"When is Woodward gonna quit? I mean, great, he did Watergate, ""All the President's Men,"" wonderful. Now give it a rest. How many times can he rehash it?"
1,Why Believe Anonymous Sources At All Or Writers?,"Fiction is easy read and anonymous sources are hard to confirm, so why would anyone read a book with less journalistic standards of a cheap tabloid? I read it, I question it and I cannot respect someone who went on TV and claimed Clinton's innocences only later to write a book about Clinton's cover up! If he had such information at that time he should have reported it, if he didn't and now does why print it? The hypocrisy of this former Naval Intelligence Officer turned journalist has no bounds. Neither does this book, therefore place it where it belongs, next to the scandal sheets or under them which ever, it does not matter, it lacks the very integrity it calls for by others. Save your money wait for the movie which will be more inaccurate, you can bet on it."
2,Pretty Boring. Miss it.,"My personal guideline in deciding which movies to see is, if you read the book, don't bother with the show. In the case of Shadow, I would say, if you saw the show, don't bother with the book. Woodward, like Tom Peters, may have been good/lucky once. Neither have been since."
1,Questionable...Again,"Woodward's sources are earth, wind and apparently fire since he cannot produce reliable sources for two-person conversations in this book. Didn't Woodward have this same problem with ""The Brethren""? Reader,take sourceless quotes with healthy doses of skepticism."
3,Jimmy Carter gets a bumb rap,"On the whole, I found this book informative and interesting. Woodward's central thesis is that none of the five Presidents following Nixon learned the basic lessons of Watergate: 1) if there is questionable activity, release the facts as early and completely as possible and 2) do not allow outside inquiries to harden into a permanent state of suspicion and warfare.I do not think, however, that Jimmy Carter's presidency is guilty of this charge. Nothing in the chapters devoted to Carter shows that Carter tried to cover up any misdeeds. Indeed, the only misdeeds alleged were those of two subordinates, Bert Lance and Hamilton Jordan, and in both cases the misdeeds were found to be untrue or greatly exaggerated."
3,Magazine article with a hard cover,This moderately interesting book should have been kept as a magazine article. The author makes some good observations (with a decidedly liberal bend) but they did not warrant an entire book. Sunday New York Times would have been a better placement.
4,People in perfectly good faith see different things.,"Probably the most telling part of the book for me was when Woodward mentioned the movie Rashomon numerous times. ""...people in perfectly good faith see different things and have different recollections."" Perhaps the book itself is a prime example.""Shadow"" should be read alongside other accounts of the events it describes. Because Woodward makes an editorial decision to portray a single event through the eyes of a specific single person (I would love to have him give a presentation on how he made those decisions)...you are left wondering how that event might be viewed by other key players on the other end of the political spectrum.Granted, perception is relative. But to frame events through the eyes of a lawyer hired by a politician is somewhat perplexing to me. Some things are true no matter what spin is placed on them."
4,Great behind the scenes look at power,"Only ""The Triumph and the Glory"" kept me as riveted as Bob Woodward's ""Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate."" I am fascinated by the inner workings of power politics and how history is affected by personalities and the interplay between men and women who are fallibly human. Woodward has another winner with this one!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"After I finished reading this book I asked myself whatever happened to Bob Woodward, the journalist? He is now a ""Washington Insider"", and like all other Washington Insiders his raison d'etre is to protect and perpetuate his own power.Woodward is overly generous to his sources and unfair to people who did not leak to him. He repeats the same point over and over ""if only they were more open and honest"". He never questions his own assumptions and sees nothing wrong with the current Salem era witchunts. There is no soul searching on his part as so how he contributed to the current atmosphere with Woodward wannabes peeping through bedroom keyholes.There are no fresh insights in this book, just a few scoops about trivial matters to sell books. It is time for Bob Woodward to re-evalutate his career. A long hiatus away from Washington might do the trick."
3,"Some classis parts, but overall uneven...","I thought that the sections dealing with the pre-Clinton administrations were excellent and I was well on my way to thinking that this was a classic book...then I got to the Clinton section and was very disappointed. I was hoping for more than just another account of Clinton's indiscretions, but this could definetly be thrown into that pile. Some kudos, I guess, for new information, but, in my opinion, the Clinton chapters are so ""National Enquirer-ish"", it offsets the good parts. Also, the overall writing in the Clinton section could be much better (too dry). Read the Ford through Bush sections, but don't bother with the Clinton chapter."
2,pointless,"How does Bob Woodward get away with writing a book without a thesis when any freshman in college would be flunked? This was a pointless exercise in political gossip - and most of it, especially the tedious recapitulation of the Lewinsky affair, was not even new. Strangely and unforgivingly, Woodward hints at the pointed criticism of scandal-soaked press coverage and does not offer much of an opinion. It amazes me that he would not have anything to say. Perhaps it shouldn't; perhaps he's too caught up in beltway insider gossip to bother thinking about the significance of what he reports in the name of Truth. He's just stuck on boorish autopilot, more a part of the ""establishment"" that he once tried to bring down than ever."
4,Interesting behind the scenes book.,"I received Woodward's new book for Father's Day, along with THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and greatly enjoyed both of them. Bob Woodward's revelations in this book, as well as in previous works of his, must be taken with some skepticism, however, his rendering of conversations has been questioned many times. Still, his books are always thought-provoking and timely. THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY was terrific . . . well, I'd better go to that page for my review of that one."
4,Needs assembly instructions,"Nice, but it took us a while to figure out how to assemble. Thanks to another reviewer who provided instructions."
2,Leaky drip drip,The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away (better than the saucer kind) but it started leaking after a couple months. Pretty unreliable.
1,Less than a year,"Very disappointing, this lasted less than a year, purchased September 2011. It started leaking in July and can't find where is leaking from. You would think it would last at least a couple of years. Look for a different feeder."
4,Excellent,"This is the best on the market - one thing only, if you screw the base on with too much force you'll break the plastic connection and it leaks. Then you have to buy another separate base to replace the broken one."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED...PLEASE PROVIDE MORE DETAILS.,"This was a gift for my parents who are both disabled.If the product description said that assembly was required, i would not have purchased it.It may seem simple to put something together if you have the use of your hands, but if you don't---it's impossible.List this and save disappointment from your buyers."
1,Hummers like it,"This was one crazy purchase. Immediately, after hanging the Perky Pet 210P, two things happened. Hummingbirds were drawn to this feeder, like magnets. One evening I had, 2 hummingbirds sharing each perch. The other thing that happened is that it leaked slowly drip by drip, and, needed filling daily. The hummingbirds loved this feeder so I tried to fix it. I ended up fixing the leaky ""Perky Pet 210P, with a bunch of surf wax, the top of a water bottle and a rubber-washer. The neck of the bottle is not long enough, so the sugar water level is to high, and, it leaks out of the yellow, flowers. Finally, I sent this poorly designed hummingbird feeder back to Amazon. I did not get all my money back, but, that is what I get for trying to fix the Perky Pet 210P. Avoid the hassles, and search elsewhere for a quality hummingbird feeder."
1,Leaky Perky Pet 210P,"Have used this product for overe 15 years. The last order I ordered two and the first one we tried, the base leaked. Returned for replacement. Received replacement. Tried the secoond unit and then the replacement and both bases leaked. I contacted Perky Pet direct and they sent two new replacement bases. Have not tried these based yet. Not sure why the problems with the base? Hope all will be ok as we like the product but........not the leaks."
3,Feeders LEAK - but there is a solution,"Unfortunately these are the best feeders available. They have well-placed perches, easy to fill bottle, and they hold just the right amount of sugar water for 3 or 4 days use (any longer and the water goes bad).And - They ALL leak. We've purchased half a dozen of them in the last 3 years and if they didn't leak right away, they leaked eventually from the poorly designed bottom seam. The solution is a large tube of silicon caulk. You can fill the bottom channel with the caulk, let dry 24 hours and no more leak. So if you want a pretty good feeder, you'll have to do the fix, unless you love ants.One more thing: the pre-made, red colored hummingbird food should NEVER be used. Simply mix 1/3 cup sugar to 1 cup water, mix well (boiling is an option but not necessary), and use."
1,It leaks,"It leaks.There's no real reason to add anything to that paragraph. It's a fatal flaw. A hummingbird feeder that will not hold water feeds nothing. Other reviews mentioned that it leaked, but who reads other reviews? I will from now on, not just look at the number of stars on the review."
2,Bees love it,I keep going back to this feeder because of its volume only to be reminded that it usually leaks. Bees love it for this and the hummers have to dodge bees to feed. It seems to leak from the bottom v. the feed sites or the bottle entry.
1,leaky,"Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody ""improved"" them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform."
5,Soft Skin,"My wife loves this machine! Her hands dry out easily, especially in the winter and this returns them to an incredible soft state. Be sure to put on your favorite hand lotion first before dipping them in the wax! Terrific!!"
3,"Melts wax, but unit could be improved","Wax melts, but the control indicator is difficult to find and the lid's handle is too low to easily lift. The directions aren't sufficient. However, the wax does melt so it accomplishes its purpose."
3,"Works, but not perfect","I have thumb arthritis and bought the product for temporary pain relief. In that respect, it works very well. But; I have never used the paraffin wax, so I can't comment.The Pro's:Compact and lightTub handles work wellWater stays hot.Easy to clean and storeCan use for foot, if small enoughThe Con's:Takes over an hour for water to get hotCan't control water temperature(Tip-Use ice cubes to cool water)Conclusion; Handy product for temporary pain. You can't find this product in stores, hard to find similar products online. Would recommend, but not perfect."
1,Manfrotto 714B Digi - Tripod - floor-standing,"The tripod looks cute, it is compact and light weight. The is one problem - two plastic locking collars on the legs broke the very first day. I do not recommend this tripod to anyone -waste of money, poor design idea it was to use this kind of plastic."
5,Really enjoyed it,"I enjoyed hearing the story of how this business grew into the present day company. Also about how they integrate faith and business. Being an IS person, I'd always wondered how they survive without a point-of-sale retail system. What he says makes sense, and it works well for them...."
3,Interesting in parts,There are a few interesting things in the book. Not much help as far as small business goes. I do like his resolve.
5,Inpsiring and practical,"Mr. Green's book carries so much insight about how to live with integrity. First, I am impressed by the care with which he runs his organization. I really hope others have a chance to read this as well. His company's ethics seem to go against the grain of corporate America as we know it and this is all a reflection of his personal ideas. =) Second, I appreciate these reflections as well as the practical ideas he shares on how to run a business. Third, the book is easy to read."
4,He's not the world's best writer,"First things first, keep in mind that I'm an employee of the company for 3 years. My thoughts and opinions are slightly biased. Also, a lot of the information in the book is only interesting to me because it's company related material that I knew little to nothing about.This book is pretty much a brief history of Hobby Lobby and Mr. Green's ""Unorthodox"" methods of business. If you are at all captivated by the workings of the retail world, this would be a descent read. If you frequently browse the aisles of Hobby Lobby and the book caught your eye, you MIGHT be able to read it all.I am far from an avid reader, and really have no business critiquing a book but it's not very well written. Mr. Green often repeats himself and the company's history gets spread all over the book.Ultimately - An employee of the company. A lover of the store. A ""business world"" fan. Buy it. Read it. Otherwise, proceed with caution."
5,"Review of More Than a Hobby, by David Green","I ordered this book because of my familiarity with Hobby Lobby craft stores. I have found them to be a cut above other similar businesses, and was curious as to how Mr. Green got started and the way he runs them, especially in view of his practice of being closed on Sundays, closing the doors at 8:00pm instead of 9:00 or later, and his inspirational Christmas Day advertising in the newspapers.The book did not disappoint me. In addition to satisfying my curiosity, it provided insight into the probable reasons for this chain's success, as well as guidelines I can implement in my own business. A great read for anyone interested in a no-nonsense approach to running a sucessful enterprise."
4,Good Mat,"This is an awsome mat. It performed just like I expected it too.Instaltation was very simple, but getting it out of the box requered some tools to cut the tape, I recomend a butter knife from the kitchen. I have used many other mats, and I have to say that this one of the best performing mats. I recomend the mat accessory pack too. The only sugestion I have for the mat would be an ethernet or wireless port so that I can check in on it while I am away from home. I love my mat."
5,Primeval returns from the anomaly of good shows unfairly cancelled.,"Like so many other good shows that get canceled before they get a chance to find their niche, Primeval was considered dead and gone after season 3. Victim of the CGI budget among other things. But there was hope, whispers, that the show would be revitalized within another year by another sponsor. Ahhh nonsense, this wasn't Star Trek 1966 saved by viewer write in campaign. The actors will go on to other things and that will be that.The Gods of British Television though declared ""There Shall Be Anomalies"" And a great and intriguing show is back on the air revitalized and moving forward. Our favorites, Connor and Abby have escaped back to the Arc, the gruff boss is still their as is the well heeled head of security. There are new characters and hints to maybe even deeper secrets ""New Dawn""The missus and me are glad to see a great SciFi show returned to its rightful place."
4,Great show for a rainy day,"I generally don't like British non-comedy TV/Movies but I was very pleasantly surprised by this (and with Being Human but that's something else entirely). This is a very well put together, light hearted, well paced show with outstanding f/x (for TV) and solid, servicable storytelling. It is distressing that they keep randomly dropping actors from the lead roles and that might upset younger viewers."

3,Dino's in England!,"Still nothing beats the 1st season. Wish they could start all over, get the original crew back and play more with the future and how the dino's might save it."
1,IT DIDN'T WORK,I tried this but found it did not work on my Sony Bluray with updated software. I was only offered a refund and wonder if there is any way of getting one which will work on my machine.
1,Great series,"personally, i love the series so far, but I cannot continue watching it due to the fact that amazon has made this one season actually cost money for amazon prime members to watch. going back to netflix."
4,This thing is a beast,"I used this to take the bolts off when I redid my trucks leaf springs and it had no problem removing them, even the really rusty ones.. Blows right through the wheel lugs like nothing. The adjustable speed feature is nice for when you don't want to go crazy on something. Two small negatives are that 1- it doesn't come with a case, and 2- it is very easy to accidentally hit the forward reverse selector switch without knowing it when your maneuvering the thing around. Other than that, its a great tool and a solid alternative to a pneumatic impact."
3,faded pages.,I purchased this book for my daughter's school assignment. Obviously the printer had some difficulties as there are a handful of pages barely legible. I would have returned it but need it now. I usually donate these books to school for future use but not this one. On a positive note; she is really enjoying the story.
5,Fantastic,"I love this book. It is accurate and an easy read. I finished it in about a day. In addition to the the play, there are other related readings enclosed which give more insight to historical events and other perspectives. Out of all the copies I own, this is one of the better ones. A great deal, ships quickly and reasonably priced."
5,No English Subtitles,"""First, this DVD is only in French. When I posed this question to Amazon, they did not care to answer. Therefore, I am stuck with 2 DVDs that only I understand. Amazon does not have a feedabck mechanism to contact them by e-mail. If they do have one, it must be hidden someplace in its maze-like website.""Back to the movie, it is great entertainment for the kids despite being in French."
5,Wow,"What if you lived in a dimension where you were loved by all? Zenda finds out in this great book about not taking life for granted. At one point, I actually got so absorbed in this book that I felt as though I was in Zenda's world, and had to remind myself that I was really just in my bedroom. The cover art is, once again, beautiful, and the story is detailed, and easy to picture in your mind. The characters are memorable, especially Persuaja, who is mysterious and original. If you like magic, love good books, or want something entertaining to read, I recommend this fantastic series to you!"
1,Old mono sound no longer pleases,"This used to be the only choice of recording for this enchanting children's masterpiece and I enjoyed listening to it for years. However, this old mono recording has been surpassed by a much superior new recording made by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in a production directed by the composer himself, Gian Carlo Menotti. If you want the best recording of Amahl, get the other one. This is old recording is good, but the newer recording is much better."
3,Eh.,Well my son is going to play amahl and as we were practicing with our piano we couldn't keep up with the music.The music moves to fast.
5,excellent quality,"the cd has a very good audio quality, and for people that want to here the opera for practicing, this is a good product to buy."
5,My favorite Christmas music,"Having seen the original TV production of Amahl as a kid, I have very fond and tender memories of this story, and I find the music to be absolutely delightful - profound but in a very accessible and somewhat playful way. This recording brings back the spirit of Christmas to me instantly!"
4,"Mother, Mother, Mother Come With Me...","It's as good as I remember from my own childhood, and I was AMAZED when my 5 year old son DEMANDED to hear it over and over on our recent trip to Minnesota. Now, weeks after we've packed away our Christmas CD's, my son STILL sings out from the other room ""Mother! Mother! Mother come with me, I want to be sure that you see what I see!"" whenever he wants to show me something. I'm glad that such a wonderful piece of our culture has been woven into the consciousness of yet another generation."
5,Milwaukee makes a Great Rotary Drill,"The Milwaukee 1-1/8"" Rotary drill does everything it's advertised to do. I wanted a rotary drill that could quickly and efficiently drill "" to 1"" holes in concrete and also meet our needs doing small demolition projects. I have not used a core bit with this drill yet, but it has exceeded my expectations thus far.Milwaukee 5359-21 1-1/8-Inch SDS Drive L-Shape Rotary Hammer"
4,Deeper than most actor bios and the better for it,"Jeremy Brett was a brilliant actor and the best Sherlock Holmes ever, in my opinion. Knowing little of Mr. Brett other than his Holmes role and some films like ""My Fair Lady"", in which he played Freddy, there was much of interest here, from his childhood and youth, life as a young actor and with his wife and son, and his lifelong struggle with manic-depression and his own bisexuality. About half the book deals with his Holmes-era life and his love/hate relationship with the role that made him most famous. Well recommended for fans of Mr. Brett and Holmes afficionados."
1,A travesty of a biography,"An awful ""biography"" by and awful ""author"". This man wrote this biography to cash in on the death of Brett when it was originally released in 1997. The writer even admits that most if not all of Bretts friends and family refused to even speak with him, and those that did remain unnamed. There is no effort put into the research necessary, or the writing. It's evident from the number of easily checked factual errors. The author even goes as far as to describe Brett's death from Brett's ""point of view."" This is not how a biography should read."
3,Jeremy Brett bio,"The book arrived promptly and in good condition. I'm reading it now and enjoying it very much. However, there was a problem with this copy that I was not made aware of. Maybe the seller wasn't aware of it either. There are two sets of photos in the book and they are duplicates. The list of ""illustrations"" in the front of the book indicates that this copy has only the second half of the photos that were supposed to be included. The first half, which includes Brett's childhood. is missing. I wrote to the seller and requested either a different copy of the book or a partial refund of the cost. I received an answer saying they are refunding part of the cost. Since I paid with a credit card I'm assuming that refund will appear as a credit on my next bill, which I haven't received yet. If it does I'm happy. If it doesn't I'll complain."
5,Wonderfully Introspective,"You get an insight into Jeremy's character and exactly why his Sherlock Holmes is brilliant. I have often wondered why he wasn't as big a star as his English counterparts, certainly the talent was there. This book is heart-warming and gut-wretching.It will keep you captivated. A good read."
4,Acts of Contrition DVD with Mark Harmon,"A great movie and Mark Harmon was the reason I ordered it as he is one of my favorite people, I watch him on NCIS every day."
1,Stupidity personified!!!!,"I cant believe some of these views. This is a terrible picture...badly photographed, a waste of Mark Harmon, who is a really fine actor. Sorry, but that is my opinion."
1,"Excellent service, not so great movie...",This was a strange movie......great stars in it but the movie itself left me cold. The movie was delivered in a timely fashion but just would not watch it more than once.
4,Play Misty for me - almost,A really good movie Mark Harmon plays a great part and if you enjoyed Play Misty for Me you will love this movie
2,Too Superficial,"The book covers a lot of areas, but does not provide sufficient guidance for application. After completing the projects, I was disappointed with my efforts and thought I needed more practice until I picked up ""How to Draw Heads and Portraits"" by Jose M Parramon. I discovered a lot of details were not covered in this book that would have made the difference in my drawings.If you already owned this book, you need additional. If you don't, pick up something else."
2,Don't be deceived by the title,"This book is not for novice artists. I'm a Middle School art teacher and was looking for some new ways to TEACH drawing. I have ""Drawing on the right side of the brain"" and use many of the exercises in it with my students. This book doesn't even come close in my opinion. I didn't take anything from it that I could remotely use in the classroom. Reminded me of my college level drawing classes with professors that just threw a bunch of concepts out without *teaching* how to actually DO."
4,Good for complete beginners like me,"Before reading this book I perhaps could have made a drawing. But the knowledge of the drawings building blocks, the very foundation for drawing any object, would not be there.Once, after reading the book, you have the building blocks of how to do drawing: you can do pretty much of drawing you never dared to even try before.This is not a book full of technical resources, lets say I wante a complete color scheme mapping tool to gray tones ( Reading the book I don't know wether that is a valid question, I guess a pencil is limited in the gray tones it can draw so what you really need is a gray ""shemata"" for the chosen pencil ).You get insight ( The whole book is based upon you getting a successive insight, and how this relate to drawing techniques and realword objects )in the conditions wich apply to observation and drawing the object based on that.Great value for any beginner like me."
4,Another Excellent Beginner Guide,"This is another excellet guide that I added to my reference bookshelf when taking up drawing at a late age. It is good to read through once, then return to review specific chapters when you are working on projects. At least, this is the way I use it. I would rather not follow an approach step-by-step .. but rather get a good notion on how to get started and go from there.But, this book helps and supports this approach greatly.Leon"
4,Reliable sketch book,"This is a good book and wht i found interesting was how to draw trees realistically, however the figure drawings on this book are inaccurate and even ridiculous to some extent. For figure drawing get a text with a more realistic approach."
4,Very helpful book for serious beginners,"The book provides excellent instructions to master the foundation for good drawing. I have a very competent and professionally successful instructor. He has pointed out to me the areas that I need to improve. The book has become my 'in-home instructor' now. I needed to work on my perspective(mostly for objects above eye level), tonal values (light and shadow, reflections within and transitions) and translating the local color to black and white(the author has done a great job explaining this). After completing just one exercise, I could see significant improvement in my drawing. I highly recommend the book."
3,Not Very Good for the complete newbie,"I found the first few chapters to be pretty good but the drawings were too advanced for a complete beginner like me.Well it's not that a beginner can't do them it's just that they take FOREVER to complete correctly. I felt better having some initial success and building confidence on much less complex and complete drawings like some other books do. It does do a good job of explaining shading though which is why I gave it the 3rd star, it's worth the 11 bucks but is more useful in addition to several other beginner books on the subject, I would read the first few chapters and practice them then do another beginners book and come back for the last few chapters a few months later if I could doit all over again."
3,Book review,"The book arrived within the specified delivery dates. It was wrapped fine and in good shape. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but for the price,I'm not complaining. It is just one of the hazards of buying on line. I would not have submitted a written review but that it was solicited."
4,Beginners,"This is a pretty good book to start. I gave it only 4 stars because ""drawing for dummies"" had a lot more techniques and easier directions for about the same."
4,Good Introductory Text,"Good introduction to the fundamentals of drawing.With this and supplemental help from a few other texts the student should be able to get their drawing off to a good start.In addition to this you may want some subject specific drawing texts.Jack Hamm ,famous artist's figure drawing etc...and most of all draw as much as you can!Have fun!"
2,"Not as good as Edwards' ""Drawing on the Right Side ...""","This book isn't nearly as user-friendly, informative, or practical as Betty Edwards' classic, the new edition of ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain."" I'd advise getting that instead of this one."
3,really more for the fans than the uninitiated,"This is not a good place to start if you're trying out Sloan for the first time--go with any of the studio albums (except the baby-steps debut ""Smeared""). The strengths of the album are the good humor, spirited crowd participation and go for broke playing. On the other hand, the playing is sloppy, the singing is sometimes a bit off-key, and the band too often stops what they're doing to let the fawning audience fill in the blank--like in parts of ""snowsuit sound"" and ""i can feel it"". 2 cd's are too much for all except the most rabid fan, and only 1 song out of the 20-plus on the whole set surpasses the original--""Anyone Who's Anyone."" But believe me, my less than ringing endorsement of this record by no means implicates incredible Sloan records like ""Between the Bridges"", ""Navy Blues,"" ""One Chord to Another"" and ""Twice Removed."" I'd recommend you order all 4 and get caught up on the pop genius that is Sloan."
2,sloppy mess,"I like Sloan a lot and I also enjoy live albums, but this 2-CD set is just a mess. It's not unlisteneable, but it certainly tests my patience as a listener. As another reviewer noted, the playing is sloppy, the singing sometimes a bit ""off"", and nothing on here can match the studio versions. But the biggest annoyance for me is the audience; a rabid, screaming bunch of fans who sound like a group of over-excited teenyboppers at summer camp. It's nice that they are Sloan fans, and seem to know all the songs, but their constant screaming detracts from the music. It also doesn't help that some of the members of Sloan encourage the screamers and add their own inane banter between songs. I'll stick to the studio albums."
2,Buy an original instead...,"This book is very pretty, and the ideas are cute too. However, when I saw it on the bookshelf, I thought it was from Susan Branch. Branch has been publishing books since the 1980's, and since the style is almost identical (watercolor illustrations, hand-drawn lettering, even the little hearts and smilie faces scattered around), it appears that Placzek has copied the style.Branch has many, many books, also beautifully written and illustrated. I would prefer to give my money to the original."
4,A Good Gift,"I liked this book very much for several reasons. I have spent a good part of my life abroad and could relate to the stories about what it is like to be in an unfamiliar culture. Likewise, the stories touch on feelings everyone has experienced at one time or another. Who hasn't felt excited, frightened or lonely at the prospect of change? I have sent a copy to my 16 year old niece who has not travelled much but has a real interest in the world outside her own.The theme of transition and it's challenges in this book make it an appropriate one to pass on to others."
1,don't buy,"Highly cheap and unprofessional. You will not see Vancouver island here. All you will see if you buy this DVD is a bunch of wanna be ""explorers"" fooling around. They show you everything possible but Vancouver island. After fooling around for about 40 min +, they tell you how beautiful Vancouver island is. This DVD is not worth to watch it for free. Watch only if somebody pays YOU $20 instead of you paying this price for this. I want to repeat: YOU WILL NOT SEE VANCOUVER ISLAND ON THIS DVD."
4,Very powerful!,"I always look for power when I purchase a hand mixer because I use it for potatoes and do several pounds a year for the holidays. This works great, it worked just as well mashing potatoes as mixing a cake. I just wish it has an eject button for the beaters rather than having to ""pull"" them out."
4,Great Toy,The Grave Digger R/C Monster Truck was purchased for my 6 year old son as a Chrstmas present. He really loves monster trucks so this was great. It worked perfectly the first time and every time after that. Easy to use and lots of fun.
2,Great for one or two bolts otherwise useless,This has a great look and the reverse and forward switch is a great touch. But the back is too long to get into tight places when you want to get out maybe a starter or headlights or any other nut or bolt under the hood. I used on two Honda Accords with not much luck. These are great for bolts like lug nuts or axel nut or oil pan nut for oil change. Basically any big nut you can all ready reach and view with no problem. I had better luck with a cheaper model impact wrench you can get for like 99.99. You will also need lots of extentions and adapter if you plan to use this impact wrench. YOU NEED 1/2 adapter will not just fit on your regular sockets. Worked amazing for axel nut felt powerful strong motor but again you can get same results with cheaper model and its too big and bulky for anything else. This is great if you want to spend 200 bucks for something you will only be able to use one or two times.
4,Good for medium-med/hvy duty.,"Don't buy this and expect it to just turn off 300ft/lb bolts like nothing. It has a lot of grunt for its size, but predictably wasn't able to budge a Honda crank bolt (which can actually be up to 500ft/lbs after 20 yrs). Not to worry, it has loosened every other thing I've thrown at it (flywheel bolts, suspension bolts, lug nuts, etc)."
3,Not his Best,Ive only read one other Kevin brooks book but this one was not how i expected it. It dragged alot.
3,The Road of the Dead Review,"i would recommend this book for readers 13 and up. The Road of the Dead is an action packed book of loyalty, courage, and the bond between family. after their sister's tragic death, Ruben and Cole are faced with the difficult challenge of finding their sister's killer so that her body may be returned home for a proper burial. what may seem like an easy journey, soon becomes a bloody battle between the two brothers and a fearful town that has everything to hide. Ruben, a 14-year old half-gypsy who can ""sense"" things, is thrown into a world that he isn't accustomed to. can he and his brother Cole, a strong willed 17 year old half-gypsy, try and find their true gypsie roots as they collect answers to the haunting questions that the town is keeping from them?"
4,great book- sad story,"The author included too much unnecessary detail in the first few chapters, which made for a boring start. But once the first 50 pages are out of the way, things start coming together and you'll realize what an incredible story this is. This book is seen from everyone's point of view and gives an unbiased look at this case. By the time you finish the book, you'll feel like you know Amy and Brian personally. This book gives some insight as to how and why they did what they did."
2,"Three words: Research, Research, Research","Written like a long, shallow newspaper article, this book is nothing more than a rushed to market story by a news reporter. There is very little attention to detail here and the backgrounds of Amy and Brian are not explored to any reasonable degree. I had high hopes for this book but came away disappointed.What the author was thinking when he decided to include the Q&A in the center of the book is beyond me. I thought it was an insult to the readers' intelligence and completely skipped over it."
4,How could this happen?,"I purchased this book because I remember following the news when it happened. It is well written and left me troubled for some time after I finished it. It is so difficult to believe that these two young people could be so callous about a little baby -- their baby! And although the author tried to explain how parents and family overlooked Amy's pregnancy, I find it so hard to believe! If your or my daughter were 5'1"" and normally weighed 105 lbs I think I would notice. I am pro-choice but it is truly a shame that this is happening more and more often. I hope what these two have done haunts them the rest of their lives. This book is an engrossing read about this sad, sad story."
3,Love and War,"A book of short stories about...you guessed it....love and war, and occasionally both at the same time. Most of the stories were entertaining and a few were quite nice to read.I would not recommend this book/series as a place to start if you have not read any other DragonLance books, as you may not recognize the people or events. This would greatly take away from the stories. However, if you have read a few and you would like a quick peak into the characters' lives before and after their novel worthy deeds, I'm sure you would enjoy this.3/5"
3,Well...,I have to give all the short story novels 3 stars. There are some stories you won't like but they'll be 2-4 really great ones that will make the books worth the price.
1,Mostly mediocre except for...,"I read this many years ago when I was a teenager and the thing that really sticks in my mind is how awful the final story was. It's the worst bit of writing I've ever actually paid money for. Was getting published in this book the reward for this author winning some junior high school writing competition? (Of course not - it would be an insult to talented young writers!)Plus, piling on with the past of Raistlin (as other books do with other characters) seems by this stage more to do with commerce than DragonLance trying to be a truly consistent, believable fantasy world. (No wonder people question some material as canon.) Still, that is all DragonLance was designed to be I suppose. Young readers are recommended to try different fantasy series rather than scrape the barrel of the Dragonlance series."
3,"Good, but could have been Better",This book was good but it could have been better. Some of the questions could have been harder and some could have been better.
5,Recommend for the bayonet collector,very useful reference book for my bayonet collection. I would recommend for bayonet collectors. Also covers correct scabbards for bayonets as well as production numbers.
3,Economical Office Storage,"I ordered these boxes because I was looking for a low-cost temporary storage solution for some office documents. They are cute but rather flimsy. After I paid the postage and handling, I might as well have purchased some costlier ones that would have been a more long-term solution."
2,Fall apart easily,"These weren't oh so difficult to make but they keep popping apart since they're plastic, but it's a weird sort of plastic. Don't buy them."
3,Storage containers,"Love the colors, only problem is that the containers are flimsy and fold or come apart very easy."
2,"More cuisine, less skanking around","Reichl is an outstanding food writer who deserves her legendary reputation. And thus, when in this book she writes about things that have even a tenuous connection to food, it's great. Unfortunately, all too often it bogs down amid the unsympathetic, selfish, narcissistic cast of characters - including Reichl - and their infidelities, petty squabbles, etc. If I wanted that, I'd read Jackie Collins or Danielle Steele...."
3,What's this book really about?,"At times I was not sure what this book was about. It just seemed as though she was telling one short story after another. How was it all coming together and where are we going, I kept asking myself as I read. At the end, I thought ""that's it?"" It was an ok book. Since, I too was young in the 70's in Berkeley, I enjoyed those tales, however it didn't all hang together well enough for me."
3,Loved it but with reservations,"I really loved this book as I was reading it. I got completely lost in her travels to China and the cafes and countless meals in Paris. I also loved the story of her struggle to adopt a child and the way she intertwined this all back to food. But, it is a little hard to really embrace someone who is trying to get you to enjoy details of an affair she has behind her husbands back. The author seems to only be concerned with her culinary delights and expresses no remorse over her dishonest actions. I think to really love a book you have to have an affection for the person telling the story and I couldn't help but feel like someone taking the side of an untrustworthy friend."
3,Good but could be better,"The witty writing drew me in immediately. I laughed aloud at her tales of work and life in Berkeley. Her description of her affairs was painfully long and made me feel embarassed for her and the people involved. It is unclear why she felt it necessary to reveal this area of her life at that level of detail. I almost stopped reading at that point. Thankfully, she moved on to new food and travel adventures. I liked the inclusion of recipes and enjoyed reading about her family life, when it did not expose her unsavory behavior. Overall this was a quick, funny read that she could have focused more succinctly."
1,"Well, at least she cooks","Tender at the Bone was a good book. Comfort Me with Apples was not. I finished Bone wanting more, and finished Apples wishing I'd stopped after one course."
5,Absolutely Delicious !,Ruth Riechl's books are like great food. You will enjoy every bite of it and come back for more.
1,A Poorly Written Sequel Which Begged For A Serious Editor,"A was VERY disappointed by the book, and could not decide if I was more disgusted by the sloppy manner in which she wrote it, or her inability to take responsibility for the fact that she made a sport of committing adultery. Clearly, this book was dashed out to hopefully continue and cash in on the success of ""Tender At the Bone."" How is it that one can be applauded for ""living life to the fullest""(as other reviewers have commented) when what she seemed to be doing was destroying the lives of those who loved and supported her?"
3,Not nearly as good as Tender on the Bone,"After thoroughly enjoying ""Tender on The Bone,"" I eagerly awaited the publication of Reichl's latest work. While the book is well written, it lacked both the wit and sparkle that made ""Tender"" such a hit for me. While both books are autobiographical, the first focused more on the humor and tenderness of the events in her life (and of course the food), and this one seems to focus more on her life (and the food).If this is your first Reichl exploration, stop...click over to ""other books by this author,"" and order a copy of ""Tender on The Bone."" If you are a Reichl fan, this is a decent read, but wait for the paperback."
3,"first of all, it's not really about reviewing restaurants","This book is not as interesting as ""Tender at the Bone."" It also isn't really about her career as a restaurant reviewer. It's about her love affairs and the end of her first marriage. Ruth Reichl comes across as self-absorbed and immature. She seems to have been acting out dramas that most people go through as teenagers, although to be fair it doesn't sound as though she was allowed to be a teenager since she had to deal with serious problems such as her mother's mental illness while she was a teenager. She excuses some rather tacky behavior by claiming to have been in love. And there was more than I wanted to hear about her sex life, written in the same low-brow style as a romance novel. Not her best."
3,5 Stars Compared to Any Other Book,"This is a great book. It just suffers by comparison to its predecessor. Before I bought it, I read other reviews that mentioned this book's emphasis on Ms. Reichl's relationships with her husbands and lovers. I didn't think that emphasis would make the book any less enjoyable for me than Tender at the Bone, but it did. Still, if you've read the first one, you'll no doubt want to hear more of the author's very interesting life and her honest and informed observations."
2,bland on the palate,"Worth reading, if just barely, for the dishy (pun intended) anecdotes about Wolfgang Puck, Danny Kaye, and Other Celebrity Chefs I Have Known. Otherwise, this book reads like a soap opera. If you actually want to read about food, sample M.F.K. Fisher instead."
2,Will do in a pinch,"I travel a great deal and am always looking for an entertaining book to pass the time. I am also an avid cook and love reading about fine dining and travel. This book bored me to tears! It did have some lovely descriptions of travel and food and I enjoyed the recipes but there was too much information about her love affairs, marriage and infertility problems. Who cares? Either write a book about food or write about your screwed up personal life but don't combine the two. The book struck me as the ramblings of a self-absorbed, wanna-be celebrity food writer."
4,"Good read, occasionally elitist","Enjoyed the food writing in this book, as with its predecessor, and was thrilled to read a description of a restaurant I've been to in Thailand!That said, there were occasionally annoying instances where Reichl used several lines of French without bothering to translate or provide a meaning -- as if all of us, of course, are also fluent French speakers. Sometimes this made the prose confusing, as when she was eating boar in France but forgot to provide us with this telling detail in English. I also found the recipes, as with ""Tender at the Bone,"" often so complicated there's no way I'd bother to make them."
2,hoped for more,"I loved Tender at the Bone and was hoping this would deliver the same humor, captivating story line and recipes. It doesn't deliver. Just a messy life and someone trying to figure out who they are and what they want in life. I think another reviewer used the word MANIC - I would agree with this. Read Tender at the Bone, skip this."
3,Mediocre,"This book was good as far as providing the authors perspective on how she rose to be a critic. It has great insight on how a critic builds his/her reputation, by detailing her travels in order to understand food. However, the book fails in one part. I should have been spared from the authors weakness with men. Her sexual exploits with Colman Andrews and Michael Singer, belong in a soap opera or in her diary. To me, it was like taking me to food heaven in one of her stories, and then all of the sudden I was dropped into a quagmire of personal conflicts and love making."
3,First book much better than second book,I read 'Tender At The Bone' and enjoyed it all the way through and I had looked forward to this second book. The writing about food related events are Ruth Reichl at her best and the recipes are very good. Her personal life was interesting in her first book but should have been a very minor part in this second book.
5,The Adventures of the Black Stallion season 2,I loved this. Great product for a fair price. There is nothing better in the television genre then clean family entertainment. Gotta love the friendship between Alec and The Black.
4,review,"This is really an excellent journal!The only downside is that the shipping does leaves scratch marks on the cover, as previously mentioned, but that isn't really visible unless you examine it closely.However, the actual journal was unbelievable. The pages are of exceptional quality, I was able to use ink and pens on them fairly well. The lining on the actual paper isn't as dark as I expected it to be, either, which would probably distract from the actual content! :)The pages are also handstitched, which was surprising to me.. The spine has six little braided strings stitched into the cover, making it easy to sit open without stretching or damaging the book itself. The back even had a pouch to store things in (it is actually quite large).I recently visited a bookstore to compare prices, I'd have to say that amazon's was much less expensive.. A few scratches on the cover is worth the price, I think..!"
5,More beautiful than expected,"This journal is very nicely made. It is sturdy and being a left-hander, it is comfortable for writing. It was definitely more beautiful in design than I expected. I'm very pleased with this journal as I have been journaling for many years and pass over many other journals I've seen in bookstores because they're difficult to use for left-handed people."
2,FINALLY THE SIMPLE TRUTH AND FACTS -- & IT WORKS!,"This book, ""Victory Over Fat"", really lays it all out on the line for you. This doctor tells you everything to actually understand what happens to your body whenever you eat. One step leads to another and I now know that ANYONE can achieve their goal by following such easy to understand guidelines, or facts. Period. Simple. I firmly believe that our Public School System should add this book to their curriculum. If we are going to teach Health/Sex Education to our children, we surely need to teach these same children how to not only avoid STDs, but how to avoid such catastrophies as Childhood Obesity and Early-Onset Diebetes.I've never felt better or more energetic and I don't have any more painful bloating. I can keep going all day and know that my body is getting the food and energy it needs so I can do what I need to do without hurting it long-term. And am I getting lean! Unbelieveable! Thank you Dr. Alexander!"
4,"Castles, Ghosts, and Murder","As usual, Goldy Schulz, caterer cum sleuth, manages to solve the murder while producing sumptuous feasts, this time in a castle, battling her ex-husband, protecting her teenage son, and agonizing over the return of her husband's old girlfriend. She manages to adroitly leap from one crisis to another, accomplishing more in a day than most people do in a month. The action never stops. I also liked the sub-plot theme of trust in relationships.Narrator Barbara Rosenblat brings the story alive with her amazing range of voices. It fascinates me that she can actually sound like a man as well as a child. I've also enjoyed Ms. Rosenblat's renditions of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon park ranger mysteries and, amazingly, in Elizabeth Peter's intriguing Egyptologist mysteries, Rosenblat tells the story in an English accent."
2,What a disappointment,This book does not live up to the standards set by the previous Goldy mysteries. They each behave as no reasonable person would...a caterer calling her client at 6 a.m. to say we're moving in? A wife leaving her shot and recuperating husband alone all day while she's out looking for clues? This book is full of such nonsense it makes us not care a bit about how it all turns out.
3,"Far-Fetched, But Entertaining.....",This one wasn't my favourite of the Goldie series -- but it was entertaining. And I am compelled to state here: I rarely read the reviews of fictional books (this time is no exception) before I've read the book because SO OFTEN (as occurs in this string of reviews) someone feels compelled to write out the entire plot except for the final final outcome - and that is SO irritating. It is like telling someone 90% of a movie's plot when you KNOW they've not seen the movie. PLEASE don't do that. Refrain yourselves from re-capping and summarizing the entire book okay??
3,Not Davidson's BEST!!,"If you have not read any of her other books, do not start with this one. Being a Davidson fan, it seems to me that she did not tie everything together like she does in her other books. The plot was a little to far-fetched!! It was still pretty good and her recipes in this book sound delicious...."
4,"Fun mystery, wonderful recipes!!","Diane Mott Davidson has done it again, another fun mystery involving Goldy, the caterer/sleuth along with murder and missing valuable stamps, not to mention an appearance by Goldy's husband's old girlfriend. The story begins with Goldy's picture window being shot out, a suspect in a police case turning up dead near a catering sight, and after that , the clues and suspects mount up faster than the calories in the recipes!! There are wonderful recipes for scones, shortbread cookies and the totally fantastic and irrestible chocolate emergency 911 cookies!!! Davidson's mysteries are fun and interesting, and while some may find them a bit of a stretch for their imagination, the story is very entertaining and enjoyable. You will not be dissapointed. The characters are interesting, and some of them are really out there, and that is what makes the story move! I have read all of this series of books, and while some are better than others, this one is one of the most fun!!"
4,Very pleased with condition,I purchased this set of books for my 86 year old aunt; she was very pleased with the quality and the story line. I was very pleased with the prices and the condition of the books.
1,"Trite, man-hating tripe","This was the first, and last, Davidson title that I've read. It was dreadful tripe.The main character, Goldy, is totally unsympathetic. She's a professional victim, always whining about her ex-husband, when she isn't spying on him and his new girlfriend, or interfering with his relationship with his son, that is.As for the plot, what plot? It's an incoherent mishmash of totally unbelievable coincidences and wild changes in direction.A bitter divorcee might enjoy this book, but only for the ex-husband bashing. Everyone else would be well advised to stay far, far away from this steaming pile of dog doo."
2,Puhleeeeeeeeease . . .,"Love the recipes. Hate the ex-husband. This woman is getting like Jessica Fletcher -- you don't want her to visit because somebody is gonna die. Her front window is shot out. Her car window is shot out. Her son is still fragile and whiney. The ex-husband is at it again. Now there is a mysterious ex-girlfriend of the new husband. Julian, the vegan-chef-in-training, to the rescue. How much more can a person take? Now, the stamp thing was interesting, but that's about it."
3,"Entertaining, but not her best novel","I've read several of Diane Mott Davidson's books and this one was not my favorite. However, I still enjoyed it and will continue to read more. It seems like Goldy gets hurt in most of her stories and she's certainly got a lot more energy than I do. I'd probably go to the hospital, but she continues on cooking for therapy. The castle and it's inhabitants are very strange, but the story does keep your interest."
2,Recipe for disaster,"I don't expect a lot from Diane Mott Davidson's books. I'm happy with a light read with some interesting characters. But this book was a big disappointment. Some of the behaviors & plotlines were extremely unrealistic and poorly developed. And Goldy's behavior was inexplicable and irresponsible. As a result, she just wasn't very likable. And that's a key component with this series. There were also too many questions left at the story's unrealistic & problematic ending. If this were a recipe, the chef skipped a few steps, used the wrong seasoning, and microwaved the resulting mess."
4,Treat to watch,"I bought this for my mom who lives out in the middle of nowhere and doesn't have cable or satellite. She watches an episode as a ""treat"" in the evenings and she really is enjoying. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't personally watched the entire series."
1,Poor Quality,Had problems with Season 6 as the the picture wasn't sharp and sound was missing at times. For the most part we saw the season. Now when I tried to watch Season 9 the first episode had no sound and I just sent the DVDs back. Also please note that the picture was not crisp once again. How does CBS continually allow poor quality DVDs in the market place?
3,Scratches & Scuff Marks,"Goes without saying this is another great season of The Amazing Race.The disappointment is like the previous two releases, my discs arrived with scuff marks and circular scratches on them. These were caused by the burning process used by the company that produces them. They don't seem to have much quality control with their discs and really shouldn't be charging a premium price for low quality discs."
5,Inuyasha is the BEST!,"Inuyasha is the bet manga i have ever read!! Inuyasha is a hanyou or an half-demon. This manga is about a girl from present times that falls into a well and get transported to the past, her name is Kagome. Kagome is the reincarnation of a dread priestess named Kikyou. Personally i think Kikyou is the best female character and Inuyasha is of course the best male character! I' won't give too much away or i'll spoil the WHOLE story...hehe...INUAYSHA IS THE BEST!!!!!! ^.^"
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I added this movie to the queue, even thou I knew nothing about it, because I love the cast. Summer of Fear is based on the novel, Simon Says, and was a TV movie, and therein lies the problem. This story is amazing and would have made a great feature film, however they had to censor it and dumb it down big time for TV. Corky Nemec and Gregory Harrison were both amazing. I've always enjoyed both of them and together they had fantastic chemistry. Summer of Fear is a very entertaining story that will throw you a few twists. Despite never reading the novel, I'm willing to bet it goes further and is more direct than the movie was. It was a great cast and I definitely enjoyed the film, but it should have been so much more."
4,Summer of Fear,Sometime wonder how it would been like if I was in his shoe. you never know.....un let you walk the walk to understand. I enjoyed Harrison movie....
4,Worked Ok,"The product is a gel. It applies rather thickly and then dries to a nonslick surface. It's impossible to keep everything from sticking to a car, but I would say this eliminated 90 to 95% of our bug removal problems. It rinsed right off in our local self-service ""wand"" car wash. It was on the car for three full days even though the instructions say to remove it within 24 hours for best results. I've posted a copy of the label with instruction under the pictures section here."
5,Bill and Ted's Most Excellent Collection,Excellent set of movies from the 80's. I forgot how funny both movies were plus the cameos by George Carlin were great.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh.
4,incredibly goofy,"this pair of movies are incredibly goofy which make them the perfect set for a fun night in. the first movie is a classic and the second is so strange that it's funny. the totally non-bogus disc has a ton of material on it, too."
5,Who doesn't love Bill and Ted???,Bill and Ted's excellent movies will be cult classics for eternity! Something strange is definitely afoot at the Circle K!
4,Great Stuff,"Although the first movie was significantly better than the second, I though the opportunity to buy both together was great. They look and sound fine and there's some good extras. I only wish there was commentary."
4,Bill & Teds Most Excellent Collection,"If you loved the movies, you'll love the collection, but the bonuses are a bit lacking, as they have no extra fotage."
3,Wild Stallyns Dude!,"Bill and Ted I & II plus a bonus dvd of extras. Not a bad deal for the price that Amazon.com give you. However these movies are for the lovers of the corny 80's genre. I myself can't get enough of them, but it's definitely not for everyone, just those of us who know about it."
5,Perfect,"This is a great water bottle. Backed by Nalgene's unbreakable bottle guarantee, it is pretty indestructible and I throw it around for fun sometimes to test said guarantee, which is always fulfilled. The narrow mouth I find is far better than the wide mouth because you can drink from it while walking and just drink from it anytime without being worried about spilling on your shirt."
4,Helpful in learning to roll.,"This video was very helpful, along with lessons, in learning to successfully roll. It teaches both the sweep, the C to C, and the Pawlata roll."
4,good spreader and convenient to reach and manage from tractor seat,"Good spreader and convenient to reach and manage from tractor. After much decision preparation I chose this spreader. The reviews of others pursuaded me to make this choice. When I assembled it I thought I had made a poor choice. Turns out it spreads lawn feed and lawn insect material (only products used to date) very well, and is comfortably managed while towing. A benefit of it's light weight is it is easy to shake the material in the hopper when reaching the near empty state and while one is still towing."
3,Tips over on hilly terrain,"This is a solid little spreader that takes granules of all sizes and it fairly easy to use, but if you have any hills be ready to hang onto the handle to prevent it from tipping over. My riding mower gets up to a pretty good clip and if I'm not careful even a tight turn could send this thing spilling all the stuff.It was easy to assemble, and it's big enough to handle a full bag of most things although I've never had to use any setting past ""1"" because it is quite generous with the amounts it distributes. I've already saved a ton not using Leisure Lawn and since I have to mow anyway, it's not like it adds that much time to my lawn chores.Note that you will need some kind of hitch to attach it to your riding mower."
3,Good Enough,"This broadcaster works fairly well, but does tip over quite easily. I immediately bent the tongue on the front due to some rough ground, but was able to straighten it out and continue. I learned to bolt the tongue tightly to the hitch, allowing just enough play for it to turn. Otherwise, it works as advertised and the price was right."
1,Earthway 2050TP,"Spreader made very cheap. Not at all the product that was described. Would not recommend for anyone. I have 2 other Earthway spreaders and they work well. Love Earthway products but, this thing sucks."
5,Earthway 2050TP,Works great. Wish I would have bought it sooner. My yard is all hills and uneven ground. I had no trouble filling it up and doing the whole yard in about 45 min. The only thing it did not have was the pin to connect it to the mower. But I already had one that came with a trailor I have.
3,eathway 2050tp spreader,"The build quality is good, but the gauge for the fertilize setting is way off. You have to experiment with the called for setting to get it cut down to where it puts on the right amount."
3,towable spreader,"It is ok. It would be nice to have double the capacity, It would not cost a lot more to manufacture such a unit."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I used the Earthway 2050TP to do my 2 acre lawn and I am pleased with its performance. Its spreads evenly and empties the hopper completely. I never had one problem with the settings changing and I traveled over some very rough terrain. For the price, I am not sure I could have done better."
3,Fair at Best,The unit's wheel base is so narrow that it tipped over on a sharp turn the first time I used it. When this happened it bent the thin metal bracket that attaches it to the riding lawn mower. I wish I had spent more money and got a little better unit.
4,Nice to have but I didn't use it much,"I'm sure many people are very impressed with this book, it is well written and very informative but so were the instructions I got along with the rebuild and shift kit I bought. Quite simply with the B&M Transkit I bought, I didn't need this book, it had all the instructions I needed. I did give it 4 stars because it is a good book, just not one I needed."
3,Mostly a great book...,"Overall the book is great, tons of good information about the inner workings of a th-400 transmission. However in the copy I got there are missing pages, I didn't realize it till quite a while after I received the book. I'm not sure if mine was just a misprint or if there is a problem with this edition in general..."
