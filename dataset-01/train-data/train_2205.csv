2,Where are the secrets ?,"after reading all this book, i was surprised.Yet, many informations are available with an Internet Connexion, as we can read in the french book ""Le Guide du Cyberd√©tective"", ISBN 2702707831, where Alain STEVENS explains that most informations can be found in the white or the grey zone.Some of urls are not always avalaible, and I am not sure that tey are really used by thousands of Private Investigators."
4,Little Black Book,"I have been using the Investigators Little Black Book for years in the paperback and have always found it to be helpful to have information at your fingertips .... Robert Scott has been an icon in the PI business for years and has done tons of research to keep this book updatedWilliam E. BenselUpstate Investigations, LLCGreenwood, SC"
5,"Organized, Logical and Utilitarian.","If you need to find information on someone, the sources cataloged in this title are a great place to start. One of the few titles today that provides a good balance information on little-known web resources as well old fashioned printed directories and paid search services.Organized, indexed and logically laid out, The Investigator's Little Black Book 3 is easily read cover to cover or used as a handy quick reference guide. Complete with notes and tips on information resources where needed, the Scott has done an admirable job of researching the information contained herein."
2,Learn Towboat Basics,"I have to admit, I had only a half-hearted attraction to the topic. When I first picked up this book I was curious, but skeptical if it would grab and hold my interest. What this little book has to offer is a bit surprising. The casual observer can learn towboat terminology and get a closer glimpse of what the job is like, all told with mild humor from the author. In the back there is a list of frequently spotted towboats and a little information about them.If you have a secret fascination with river traffic and are curious to know more about what you see. This book is for you."
5,Shake it!,"Ravenstone delivers some serious ass shaking sounds that are both smart and fun. No instructions are needed to operate this album. Just turn up the volume and pump it while `Oilman' learns the joys of prison sex. `Snap your Finger Puppets' to the `Transit of Venus' with `The Girl With Something Else.' Dance rock is alive and well. `Back On The Rock' is fun for the whole body from the mind to the toes, like music ought to be."
4,A VOICE OF CASUAL COOL,"A lot has been said about this stalwart band's stripped down dance rock on their Back On The Rock outing, but the songs that really connect for me are Transit of Venus (not sure what the title means but I like it) and Girl With Something Extra (not sure what this song is about but I like its playfulness). The tunes feel fresh and have an uncanny charm with repeat listens. Ravenstone's frontman, Michael Simpson, has a voice of casual cool on these songs, like he just crawled out of bed or is just crawling into it with the woman of his dreams."
3,Some Seriously Frisky Music,"I found BACK ON THE ROCK in a stack of CDs on my boyfriend's desk. These guys cook up some seriously frisky music. I liked the music so well I checked Amazon to see if the band had any other albums out. I have to say I love the loony send up of Bush, Stewart and Enron's Kenny Boy on ""Oilman"" the best. And ""Drivin' By Braille"" is sexy in a John Waters ""viagravated"" sort of way. The band's vocalist sounds more sensual than most front men half his age. I give you guys three stars and a big mmmmmmmm... ;-)"
3,Bug-Eyed WIth Joy!,"This CD left me bug-eyed with joy! Ravenstone should be added to the roll call of great Athens' bands.I read that this CD was recorded in one or two takes for each song and I love the way it sounds. Just the essentials here with a few horns thrown it when it feels right.So much rock today feels like it was recorded over many months in a studio until everyone was crawling up the wall. There's a charming looseness to Ravenstone's sound and it's refreshing.The best tracks for me are ""John Burrows Died For Our Sins,"" ""Oilman"" and ""Drivin' By Braile."""
3,Glory Days Of Athens Rock Return,"This great roots rock 'n' funk CD reminds me of when I saw this band (not sure if it was the original line up or not) open for Dennis Yost & The Classics Four back in the 70s. The venue was full of moon-struck, starry-eyed love birds who had paid their bucks to hear Dennis the Menance croon ""Traces of Love"" and ""Spooky"" on Valentine's Day.After Ravenstone drilled a set of stompin' in-your-face rock into their brains the crowd stared blankly at the band like they were brothers from another planet who had just nuked the place. What a complete laugh riot. It was perfect.This CD shows that the boys have lost none of their chops or their swaggering cool since those glory days!"
3,"It's a G Thang (as in ""good"")!","It's a G Thang, G as in ""good."" The drill of a lead guitar on steroids, precision drums and bass, muscled-up rhythm guitar. It's all there when track one blows out of the gate. And you just gotta bring the love to ""Girl With Something Extra."" It's so wack."
4,Props For This Bamfest!,"Wassup. Ay yo trip! By the by, gotta give props for this bamfest by the sultans of ping. It be all wool and yard wide. I'm kickin' it totally bladdered with the first nugget `bout my boy drivin' with one headlight. Then we bangs a left on the second wack track `bout a bootylicious with a little sumin sumin extra. I be bonfoggled by that box social. You figure that diggily sista out, slam me an e. ""Oilman"" ends with this homeboy upstate droppin' the soap. That's so ill. Kenny boy gonna need ice after that worm salad. ""Boomer"" breaks down the history of the boom box used caucasionally. In ""Venus"" our boy is all up in the lounge mode searchin' for the fat rabbit. That's carpe P.M.The King Killa McChilla here is ""Finger Puppets."" It's poppin'!"
4,Punk Funk & Roll!,"My mom of all people turned me on to this CD. (I think she knew the band when she went to the Unversity of Georgia.) It reminds me of the punk funk sound of Gang of Four on their totally awesome ""Entertainment!"" CD. I find ""Back On The Rock"" the kind of record that's compulsively dancey."
2,Makes mediocre Coffee,"Like others, I found that it has its own ""ideal"" pod size - others are a compromise. But what is really disappointing is that the Coffee it makes from Melita (the pods I received with the combo offer from Amazon)and other non-JV pods, such as Senseo, is so ordinary yet so expensive. Stick with a good vacuum-insulated carafe coffee maker."
4,Better experience than others,I have not had as hard a time using this machine as some of the other folks on here. The pod size that it accepts is smaller than normal and to eliminate the spilling I simply made sure that the pod didn't overlap the rubber seal when it closed. I can use any size pod I need in it. I have to admit it is annoying to get the right sized amount of water to come out but I have found the two small cups from this makes one normal mug. It was free from Target w/ purchase of the pods... I can't complain.
1,Poor Design,"Water tank needs to be removed to be filled, even for 1 cup and at that the flap on the tank is awkward making it difficult to fill.The clasp to secure in the pod is poorly designed. It jams at times and at best is hard to secure.The amount of water going through the system varies at times for no reason.The design issues make this machine a poor choice. The quality of the coffee is ok but I find that true of every coffee machine regardless of price. I like coffee but not a snob about it."
5,Excellent Book,"Nancy Moore has written a heartfelt story of the life of her daughter, Theresa, tragically taken by breast cancer. Seeking to paint a portrait of Theresa, for Theresa's daughter Madison, Nancy also finds a way to come to terms with the loss and pain that she feels. The story is powerful and moving, and is a must read for everyone, as cancer leaves no human untouched in some way.The work that Nancy continues to put into breast cancer reserch is a stong encouragement as well. Readers will find this book touching and sad, yet filled with warmth and reassurance. Written from experience, this book is a real winner!"
5,Truly The Most Beautiful Rose,"Nancy writes beautifully about Theresa's life and her struggle for life. Nancy also lets everyone know there is hope beyond hope. Theresa's fight was valiant and her mother's account of her whole life is a wonderful tribute. Theresa's daughter Madison will truly appreciate what her grandmother has done for her. The book very truly indicates how precious life is, and how, we as the people left behind must tell our loved ones everyday how much we love them."
5,A Reminder for Us All,"The True Story of Theresa, The Most Beautiful Rose is an incredible journey through the life of a young woman who was taken too early from her family and friends. This account not only shares the devastating effects of cancer and cancer treatments but it sets an example of the power of love and faith. Nancy Moore has a powerful story to tell and her work is well written. This book is hard to put down and leaves the reader desperately wanting to change the ending of the book. There is a strong message here to never give up hope and to treasure each moment of life and the love of those around us all. There are lessons to be shared - never stop looking for answers and miracles, never forget to say I love you, always remember that life is a precious gift and hold onto your faith."
3,Philokalia (Vol. 4) - The contemplative life,"Much like its predecessors, this book mainly is concerned with the contemplative life as well as a solitary existence. Although no one can argue that to be in tune with oneself and one's surroundings is admirable, the method to this awareness as described by these authors is a bit impractical in today's society. Most useful in my opinion was the works that help the reader take notice of the things and events around them. What I disliked the most was the blaming of the tempter for our woes, when it is us who takes notice of the temptation and ultimately sins. Regardless, this is important reading for those of the Orthodox faith and those students of religion searching for the ""whys"" of what they believe or at least where they have originated."
1,The Philokalia VOLUME 4,I thought I was purchasing the Philokalia Volume 1 that got from the library but I noticed the one I got from Amazon was Volume 4. Needless to say through the course of time between the volumes the true meaning displayed in the first volume was not carried over in volume 4. Volume 1 was in line with the Bible whereas Volume 4 had blatent discrepancies to the point I'm going to throw it away. I searched Amazon again for the Philokalia Volume 1 but didn't find it. Do you know where I can get it?
5,Personal thoughts,"The Philokalia are a well-spring of ""jewels"" from the holy fathers available to us for the taking anytime. In an age where there is so much print available, good and bad, it is a great source of consolation to have these sayings as a life jacket. I use the Philokalia alongside studies of the Scriptures, in catechism classes, in sermons, and in articles. They are helpful as part of a rule of prayer as well. Buy the book and never let it get dusty!"
4,Excellent,"As the back of the book says, the Philokalia is the most important book other than the Bible for Orthodox Christians, and it is truly amazing. The glossary at the back of this book helps a lot, and contains explanations of many very important Orthodox beliefs and terms. The only complaint I have is that I wish the translators and editors would have included St. Nikodimos' comments on the various writings he compiled within this English edition. It seems that they would have been very helpful and retaining them would have remained true to the original compilation by Ss. Nikodimos and Markarios."
4,Great little mp3 player minus a few quibbles,"Price and size are great. It's tiny, light and accepts standard CF cards to increase the memory size (no one in their right mind would use the 8mb card it comes with). Who cares about an LCD display or equalizer functions?I do have a couple of problems with it:1) Despite taking ""industry-standard"" CF cards, there are some cards that are incompatible with the IJ-50. I bought a Simple 96MB card only to find it was not compatible. There is a compatiblity matrix on www.ijamworld.com. Make sure your card is supported before buying. I have successfully used a Kingston 48MB out of the box with the IJ-50.2) No belt clip or arm band. This radio is useless for exercise except for walking. A belt clip would next to nothing to the price but make this player so much more useful. As is, it is very easy to drop while running (as I have done several times)."
2,For Free it rocks for ($) maybe 3 stars anything above 2,"Some confusion on these reviews. The IJ50- has no radio tuner. It's a bare bones plasticky and as your sole player not a load of fun. Though if you already have CF memory lying around, need a usb card reader you basically get the player for ($), assuming a ($) or less price tag. Headphones are as expected useless and uncomfortable to boot.I was lucky enough to win one of these, only reason I have it, and the sound quality,battery life are excellent. Build quality yuck. Software accompanying it not amazingly useful and I-jam's site, a dogs breakfast. Are they selling MP3 players or DVD's this week :-) you decide. This player is hideously outgunned for the price, as such it would not be possible to recommend it for anything other than a clearance price, and then only if you need a CF reader."
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"8Mb! That's it, only 8 megabytes. Of course, you can buy additional memory, but that's just another annoying thing you have to do extra. Why couldn't they just raise the price and give it some more memory??"
1,8mb!!! Thats it,"This mp3 palyer is great except for one thing, it's only 8mb. That will only hold 2-3 songs."
4,GREAT DEAL!!,"Wow,this is a great product. I am not saying that it is the best product out there, but for the price that you are paying, I think you just can't beat it. It might not have all the functions that you might find on the other competitors, but it has an FM tuner. The Nomad II has an FM tuner, but it costs so much more. If price is the issue, then this is the way to go."
2,better prices elsewhere,"These are the BEST non-coated acoustic guitar strings I have ever played. They wear very well, sound great out of the box (perhaps Martin SPs sound a little better brand new) but they last a long time, sound good even when they haven't been changed in a while, and very rarely do they break.If you want them cheaper, sweetwater sells them for $5.99 a set with free shipping.For bulk orders, FQMS (first quality music supplies) and Elderly Instruments both have deals where you can get $5.35 a set, but FQMS you need $200 to get free shipping, Elderly you need $150 and 10 sets of the strings to get them at that price with free shipping.By all means get these strings. They are awesome. Just get them somewhere else, like sweetwater. Or FQMS/Elderly if you are buying other things or buying in bulk."
3,a little too old fashoned for me,"the bar is light green colored, and has that unusual old fashioned scent, i've also tried the No. 6 also old Fashioned, and the almond - I like the almond best"
2,Not a good tape,it has some OK matches but nothing worth this much money. The ladder match ws a joke!!
1,None of the Matches were even decent,This was a poorly done ppv. WCW has talent but they didn't use it. The Bill Goldberg vs. Scott Hall Ladder Taser Match had potential but failed to deliver. You can fast foward threw the majority of it and not miss much.
5,SKF Sleeve / Seal Kit,Kit comes with good step by step instructions on how to install the repair sleeve. The seal is a heavy duty type seal and of better quality than what was offered at the local parts store or Chevy dealership. Installed with no problems and no oil leaks after installation. Price played a big factor in ordering through Amazon and my order was received in a couple of days.
3,REGION 2,"I saw this movie ages ago and really liked it. Glad to find it here and I bought it pretty cheap. BUT - it's REGION 2! This isn't TOO big a deal because I can actually copy this onto a new DVD and make that region free. I'll lose some quality, but this isn't exactly a special-effects blockbuster. I just wanna see the movie again.Anyhow just note that not only is this Region 2 (won't play in your DVD player) but that it ships from the UK so it takes a couple weeks to show up."
3,Not quite worth the effort,"As a big fan of Indigo Swing, I had been eagerly waiting for this release. Ilistened to it for two weeks before I could review it...I thought I might be missing something. I have finally come to realize that it's not me, that something just isn't there. This release attempts a departure from everything that set them apart as a premiere swing band.Hey guys, the word ""swing"" is in your name! Care to cut an actual swing track?This is not to say I didn't like it at all, but it won't call you onto the dance floor like ""All Aboard"" did. I am also sick of the tired old excuse of ""yeah, but you should see them live"". Well, I have seen em, but I'm buying a CD, so whats the point?Bottom line is that if you're looking for the same energy & style that came out in their prior releases, you will be disappointed. Its almost an entirely different sound."
3,Adequate but uninspired,"I had high hopes for this release from the bands past efforts and the one downloadable track from their website. The only tracks I would call high quality are tracks #2 and #3, with all the rest in varying degrees of ""average"". I recommend buying the cd, but don't expect to get a work that lives up to the bands ability."
5,Does Photos Too,"This printer is literally ""the little engine that could."" It's a small printer, but it puts out really high-quality printing. Even in Fast Draft mode, the quality is acceptable for reports. In Photo Quality mode, this is where it shines. I'm surprised; it's like the photos came out of one of those ""Fotomats,"" remember them?"
4,Good but could be better,This trash can has two bins within that are both the same size and color. It would be better if one side was larger than the other (recyclables) and if the bins were different colors so that you could tell which one was for trash and which was for recyclables.
1,"Entertaining, but weak....'lite' reading","Adequate airplane reading, this book had tons of potential, but didn't follow through. Great plot idea, but it turned into a predictable tale in the last third. It seemed as if Higgins had lots of extra characters he wanted to include, so he dumped them in the last few chapters with no time to develop them. His portrayal of women as beautiful, strong willed, but totally helpless is stereotypical and disappointing. Don't spend the money on this one - borrow it from the library, and keep you expectations very low. You may be pleasantly surprised."
2,"Predictable, predictable, predictable","One third of the way through the book I knew what would be happening at the end, quite disappointing."
2,"Easy read, good action, sub-par for Higgins","As you'll see below, many of us Higgins fans feel disappointed with this one. It doesn't seem like he spent much time writing the story. It is a quick read with plenty of action, if that's all you want. Thin on substance in several areas. Important ones. For instance, you want to savor the villain getting his just reward after all the build-up. Instead, it's, ""Boom. Gone. Next?"" As always, his yarn has good elements. A president with character and grit, who goes beyond the ""politically correct"". (Aren't we sick of what's ""politically correct""?) Higgins has a lot of novels out there. So, you'll get the odd sub-standard one. If you're new to Jack Higgins stuff, read ""The Eagle Has Landed"" and go from there. It's a benchmark story and why we stick with him."
2,Fluffy & linear,"Not for anyone who likes a lot of ""meat"" to their thrillers. It's a nice, predictable, quick read for a dull afternoon."
5,"President, Terrorists and Sean Dillon What more do you Need?","Jack Higgins is getting better and better.The current President of the USA has a problem, his Illegitimate daughter has been kidnaped. Due to a security breach he calls on the English top secret 'Group 4' to help this department is the PM's private army, and run by Charles Ferguson and deadly rival to any group.Sean Dillon group 4's number one man is sent to help the President.Written by the master of suspence it is a gripping book that i find to be one of his best. For a long running series featuring Sean Dillon and co. it is even better."
2,"Mediocre Potboiler, alas!","Higgins is an excellent writer, and as a tale, The President's Daughter reads fast. But it is not up to the standard one has come to think of as good, innovative Higgins stuff. He uses the same characters from earlier books, and weaves them into the story in the most artificial, forced way. Consequently, one who has read some of the earlier books, especially those with an IRA theme, will find oneself wondering what a world of coincidence we live in! But, the characters are thin and don't ring true to me. The story is a bit amateurish, coming from a pro like Higgins. And, I think his portrayal of the Israelis, although perhaps justified in some ways, is half hearted criticism. If he does not like Israeli policy towards the Arabs, and evidently he doesn't, then let him come out more frankly and more precisely. Sorry Jack, but this one is clearly a pot boiler. I hope your next one is a lot better."
2,Very disappointing from Higgins,"Higgins books are usually a lot of fun. They are usually believable. I usually finish them in a night.This one is 0 for 3 of the above. Not to reveal the plot, but I found the whole story quite implausible. I have a problem with books that depend on large conspiracies: THe larger a conspiracy, the less likely it will hold."
2,"I like Higgins, but...","This book is one of the worst books I have read in some time. Dylan is always a delight, but the writing was trite, dull and, for the most part, lifeless. The plot actualy contains elements that could have been melded together for a solid story, but they just didn't work here, or with the way the book was written. I'll be hesitant about reading another by the author."
3,Anothe Quick and Fun Read from Jack Higgins,"A good read that gets you right into the action from page one. This is the second ""Sean Dillon"" book that I have read by Jack Higgins though I preferred ""Drink With the Devil"". Here, Dillon has been asked to rescue the daughter of the President from some Israeli extremists. Like other Higgen's books, the characters are net very complex (with the exception perhaps of Sean Dillon).What I liked about this book is, like an old B-movie, it never slows down. Dillon and his connections have almost no time to solve a mystery and prevent an international crisis...and he's only in it for the money and the fact that he would hate to see a nice woman like the President's daughter get rubbed out by a crazy man.Reserve this book for the beach. Don't expect Wuthering Heights and prepare to turn some pages real fast."
3,An Irish James Bond ??,"After finishing reading the book you are left with an strange empty feeling. The story is intriguing and fast pace and the characters have the potential of being interesting, but you never find anything about them. Most of the characters could be replace by anyone of any race or gender. It's a bit like a James Bond movie where a character is going around solving problem just by being there. There is depth to any of the character except for The President (and even him takes a back place after the first third of the book). Not that the action parts are not interesting and I hope that Sean Dillon gets Air Miles cause this story goes to a lot of places in Europe and America in a few days. Now if you are looking for a book for fast reading with action and some intrigue, I do recommend this book. But If you are looking for something in witch you want to get involved with the characters and understand why such character act as he or she does, this book might leave you a bit wanting."
1,"Details, Details, Details","This book was filled with needless details. It was slow and boring. I was ready to quit reading after the 10th page. I did read the entire book, thinking that it would get better, but alas, not to be!I don't recommend this to anyone...."
3,"Starts Slow, but has a good ending","This book has a tediously slow start for about 100 pages. It had a good ending with some good action. The name ""The Presidents Daughter"" is a little deceiving since it is really only addressed in the last chapter."
3,Overall a fun ride,Good story but a sloppy ending. The intricate details of the story were so well written and the end was crammed together as if there was a page limit.
2,Less 1 star from his usual 3 (or 4 for his best works),"The scenario : an extremist pro-Israel terrorist group has access to the most sensitive Intelligence of the UK and the US, and also the US President's secret - an illegitimate daughter. They kidnapped her to force the President to launch surgical nuclear strikes against Israel's primary adversaries in the Middle-East.Then, the plot just went on a completely wrong angle. They kidnapped Sean Dillon to act as their messenger to the President. Though what happened later were not bad for an action thriller, I keep wondering why did they want to get a man like Sean Dillon, and more importantly, Charles Ferguson, involved. They could have convinced the President they got the girl and they mean business without involving people who eventually caused their downfall."
1,waste of time,"The Author wasted his time writing this ""comic book"" novel. I wasted my time reading it until I became so bored with the characature characters and farcical dialogue that I decided to write this review rather than finish the story. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,book review,The book arrived promptly ......but it had a terrible smell and it was terribly stained ...
3,"Not a ""wall frame""","Was hoping for small frames meant for hanging, not standing on a shelf, as I find the ""stand"" gets in the way of proper hanging alignment. These frames, unfortunately, have the stand and therefore will be returned."
5,The Hawaiian Eye S/T,My husband loved this show on TV so it was no surprise to see the expression on his face when he opened this up. A speedy delivery along with a 'perfect' sound of TV nostalgia. Many thanks.
4,"not bad, very honest review","The author has something unique in his book, he doesn't hesitate to say ""I am not sure"" when he isn't (something rarely found in most books today). Mr Barrett did a very scholarly book, which has plenty of details and doesn't hesitate to show that some of the ealier ""experts"" were not really experts at all but were more flamboyant than knowledgeable. If you want to know verifyable facts about freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and other secret societies, this is a good book to start with (alhtough not an end all book on the subject). One of my few criticism is that some groups like Martinism and Melanchthonism have been left out of the book...A worthwhile read!"
5,A balanced and informative view,"I was doing research into conspiracy theories and secret societies when I happened upon this book. Looking back I'm glad I found this book first, before I went on some wild goose chase following unsubstantied rumors and sinister allegations. The author is obviously very learned in this area and while I haven't read them I would also suggest his other books that have to do with religions and occult societies as well. The author doesn't indulge in some of the more preposterous accusations against the Masons, the Rosicurians, and the Illumanti, but instead presents the history and the teachings of these orders in a straightforward and informative manner."
1,what you see is not what you get,"I bought this pulley for a class project. I already had one that looked just like the one in picture and assumed that if that is what is being shown, then that is what I'll be recieving. Wrong. The pulley was a 2"" OD 3/4"" ID pully, but it was made out of thin metal, not solid like the picture shows. What made it a complete waste of money was that the ""V"" groove where the belt goes was too wide and the belt would touch the bottom of the groove and so the belt would slip, making it worthless and I had to scramble last minute to find something else that would work. I would not buy this again because what is shown is not what arrives on your door."
5,Late Most Recent Tomorrow!,"Is a fan of music I. Not did graduate high school from. Though. Hardest class English was. Star Wars Did watch times many. Great influence Yoda had. Word meaning and english usage matter not. Music good is. Fentriss great pupil of Michael Grace JazzMaster. Everything he knows, taught him. Except English and word order. Or order word. I do not remember. I cannot even remember if I am Neil or Nigel when I am causing mischief online."
1,Kenny G with Vocals,"And that might be insulting to Kenny G. This album is absolutely chock full of every cliche, musically and lyrically.I tried, too. I thought maybe my first listen was not representative, so I listened again. It was actual work to make it through the album.A sample of the lyrics:""When I think about you boyYou fill my lifewith happiness and joyAnd that's whyI'm devoted to you""That's about as good as it gets. And the music is just as bad. If you can think of music that would be appropriate to those lyrics, that would be about right.Bad bad bad."
4,trident,"Decent knife so far. Very sharp and haven't had to sharpen it yet. The locking and closing mechanism are a little clumsy and take getting used to. Feels really light in hand, I hope it holds up to heavy use."
4,"Not too shabby, one major problem.","I have owned the original black version of this knife, it worked without fail. However, I purchased this one for a friend's birthday and he loved it. Don't get me wrong, it looks great. But the spring-assist in this particular one seems to malfunction frequently. I noticed this but the reciever of the gift doesn't notice, which is fine."
5,Great knife,SOG is an excellent choice for duty or EDC knives. The blade is sharp and durable. You can't go wrong with the TF-1 Trident.
2,Not worth the money,"Today I see this knife is going for $63. I only paid $40 and even that is too much for the substandard quality of this knife. I own several Kershaw knifes (including their budget imported models) and the Trident can't hold a candle to their quality. The Trident felt cheap right out of the box. The handle feels like plastic on par with the junk sold on the late night infomercials (Frost). The blade deploys fast, but is undersized for the length of the handle. The blade was reasonably sharp, but failed several times on the paper test. There was also a considerable amount of side-to-side play in the blade and it was not centered when closed. I'm also not a fan of the closing mechanism.Basically, this knife fails in nearly every regard that I care about. I returned this knife and got a Kershaw Clash for half the price of the Trident. The Clash outperforms the Trident in every aspect.I won't be buying anymore SOG knives."
5,SOG TF-1 Trident,Ok i understand there are many good and bad reviews about this knife but i love it. i bought because i like the SOG quality and how it fits in one's pocket. i got this knife and said what a waste of money it was like the bad reviews said the blade wobbled. instead of complaining in a bad review before i used my brain i tightened it so the blade did not wobble and it still opened as easy as ever. they blade holds a nice edge and i have had no problems with it since. it is a great knife and is my edc and im glad i decided to use common sense before making people not buy a great quality product.
2,Poor quality.,"Thin pieces inside the handle create a rattling noise, possibly fixable. Was a present and was told a week later about the noise. SOG knives are lacking in quality control it seem."
5,Good price and seems solid,"I just got this knife today and so far it seems great, It opens fast and is sharp as hell. Like some previous reviewers said there is slight horizontal play with the blade, but after about 5 minutes of playing with the tightening screw I found it's sweet spot where there's no discernible movement to either side and still opens like a charm. Previously had a CRKT which got lost somehow and my father recommended the SOG and it seems like it's an even better quality knife, not to mention the reduced price. Incredibly happy with this purchase."
5,Very good knife,"This knife is a very good knife. Although the blade may look a little strange it has a built in thumb support. The handle is sturdy but i would have expected it to be metal. The spring assist is a little slower than the sog flash 2, but it is still very fast. The blade came bery sharp and was able to shave hair off my skin. Overall I would reccomend this knife."
5,such a wonderful knife,"i have collected and been a lover of the tool for as long as I can remember... this Knife, and SOG is a great product. I have carried it every day since i bought it. I look forward to buying more SOG"
5,Solid Designed,"Very light weight design.But solid, and easy operating.Recommended for anyone who is looking for an every day/all purpose useable knife."
1,sog,"I did not like this knife for the money. It has no liners so I felt it would not hold up to any strong use. The opening was fast but I had a lot of side to side play. If you tighten it down it would not open as easy, either one or the other."
3,"its ok, i guess",I was so excited about this knife but it was a letdown. The so called SOG assisted technology is a joke. Its not that its a bad knife. its just not at all what i was expecting.
4,Solid knife,"Shroud cutter is nice, action is smooth and easy. Good value for the money. I'd recommend this knife to a friend."
2,Big fat zero for out of the box reliability... but it can be broken in.,"I might have had a defect on my hands, but opening mechanism had extremely poor reliability- at least right out of the box. Blade was getting locked in the closed position where it was impossible to flip it open whatsoever regardless of safety settings. I am talking about a 30%+ failure rate. Not good.After a LOT of breaking in, it did become reliable and now opens as designed. For the money, I guess it is not a bad blade, but I think SOG is riding off of their reputation as the winner of the SEAL trials. I seriously doubt that this knife is in use with any real operators. Build quality just isn't there- rather thin blade which does wiggle a little bit in the fixed position, noted reliability issues, and it definitely feels a bit cheap. Probably best to try out a few others before buying this thing. Benchmade is a good place to start."
3,no pictures/no tiene fotos,This book has no picture a warning for those who think is like it's english version.Este libro tiene ninguna imagen una advertencia para aquellos que piensan que es como su versi√≥n Ingl√©s.
5,A must read to understand the challenges Israel faces,"Dr. Michael Anbar has produced a primer for modern Zionism in the form of this book of forty essays. These compositions reveal the basic tenets of what support for Israel should entail and deal with many issues facing Israel, American Jewry and the United States. Anbar not only deals with topics such as terrorism, historical revisionism, and Arab aggression but also proposes the responses to these. The essays are cogent, insightful and prescient. Together they are a patriot's guide for the upholding and continuation of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. Though written some time ago, many of the points raised remain valid today. The book is clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend it to anyone who seeks a better understanding of the subject.Dr. Steven CarolProf. of History (retired)Official Historian Middle East Radio ForumAuthor of Middle East Rules of Thumb:Understanding the Complexities of the Middle East"
5,Better than I thought!!,The picture does not do this case justice! It's beautiful and much more sturdy than I had anticipated! Well worth the money!!! Great deal!!
4,"Good, but broken","A decent frame for the price, but the glass had a small broken piece on the edge. I still used it, but it was kind of annoying."
1,Poor Quality and Poor Risk,I ordered these from Amazon. These frames are fragile and readily broken in transit. 4 of the ones in our set had either chipped glass or plastic sides. I suggest going with some alternative. These are not worth the money paid.
3,damaged during shipment?,"The frame overall looks great for the price, but ours arrived with a chip in the corner and the easel on the back was broken (we planned to hang anyhow). Not too happy about the chip."
1,Chipped Glass,"The product seemed to be packaged well, with bubble-wrap; however, a corner of the glass was chipped off. I will not order this type of frame again."
3,"Great frame, cheaper elsewhere!","Used these for posting 40+ fire procedure/escape routes throughout our agency. Buying in bulk was necessary, but shipping increased the cost. They look and work great, but found the exact frame at Wal-Mart for $2 each."
2,Fragile,"My frame came chipped in several places, and got worse when i placed my print inside. I would definitely not recommend. You get what you pay for."
1,No consistent performance,"I bought these frames for our church. We like to put religious art into the frames for our congregation to enjoy while praying. We also like to ""swap out"" the art from time to time so we don't get complacent.The very first frame I opened, following the directions, the glass broke off on the corner. So I opened the second one and it did NOT break, but I am a bit afraid to open the next one. The problem is I didn't open the box within the 30 day period to return the frames.I need durable frames I can count on and these do NOT fit the bill, especially if other people try to use them. I can be gentle--one of the weight-lifting members of the church might be too rough and experience what I did with the first frame: break the glass.My problem now is I have more frames and an unusable one....buyers' remorse, for sure."
2,"For a ""document"" frame, NOT document sized","I bought 3 of these to put 3 different certificates in, all printed on regular 8.5x11"" sheets of paper. However, this ""document"" frame is apparently a few micrometers smaller than it should be, and they all had to be kind of squished into the frame.It wasn't an enormous difference - literally just a fraction of an inch they were missing, but still, it wouldn't take that much to test it a little. 8.5x11 sheets of paper aren't exactly hard to find.Edit: Oh, I should add, I measured the paper and it was precisely 8.5x11""."
1,MCS Frame Review,"The concept of this frame is not bad. However, it is NOT as advertised. It says an 8 1/2 x 11 will fit into the frame but it will NOT unless at least two sides have a very small amount trimmed off and that is a pain! This last order included a piece of glass that was deeply scratched."
2,"ok book, but unauthorized","The book is quite complete up until 2004, but doesn't provide any information or pictures you can't find online for free. Also, people buying this book for the pictures should keep in mind that all but four pages are black-and-white.The most important thing to consider before buying is that the book is unauthorized, and the band was very disappointed that the author and publisher are using AFI's story, pictures, name, and reputation to make a profit. If your conscience is fine with ripping off the band, then it's a good buy."
4,Great for a quick fix,"It works good for a small job like front roots or temples, does go on kind of gooey and can break off the stick if your not careful"
4,Talk about a walk down memory lane,"This game card brings back the childhood days of Atari that's for sure, the gameplay is just how i remember it and tons of fun!I'll be the one to verify this works with Pocket PC 2002 and works flawlessly with my Dell AXIM X5. the only problem with this game seems to be the controls. on the X5 it uses the middle curcular button for ""navigation"" which can be a bit sloppy at times, but all in all this is a great investment to pass the time on commutes and ""spare"" time during your day!"
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"Good overall, but I don't think it deserves the reputation it seems to have as ""the only Jewish Wedding book you'll ever need."" For that it would need to be much better organized.For example, the author could have included an actual outline of the Jewish ceremony from Kabbalat Panim through Yichud. Instead, she peppers the book with references to all these things, leaving the reader to wonder how it all falls into place. The Jewish wedding ritual has an order and a rhythm to it, so there's no reason for her NOT to have described it all in order - except, perhaps, that she wanted to fill out the book!To get the most out of A New Jewish Wedding, you should have some prior knowledge. So order the book, and while you're waiting for it to arrive, do some of your own research on the 'net. (Aish.com's ""Guide to the Jewish Wedding"" is a pretty good place to start..."
4,A good reference if you are entering an interfaith marriage,"As someone beginning to plan an interfaith marriage and who had no knowledge of Judiaism before meeting my fiance, this book was a good beginning. Diamant offers a step-by-step outline of a traditional Jewish ceremony, as well as the ""before"" and ""after""--the tenaim, the ketubah and reception ideas. Also included are some guidelines about what is usually allowed or disallowed for interfaith couples and suggestions about how to still incorporate the Jewish feel to certain things (like the mikvah bath for the non-Jewish partner)."
2,"Thorough but not good for inter""faith"" weddings","Though my fiancee isn't a religious person, he's not Jewish. But we are having a ""Jewish"" wedding. In her book, Anita Diamant dismisses such relationships and marriages in a rather disparaging way. She seems to think that if you're not both Jewish, the other had better convert (like *her* husband did.) I don't like the tone of this book at all. It is chock-full of fabulous facts but it talks to the reader in a holier-than-thou tone that I, for one, can't stand."
3,intermarriage slighted,"Nice job, in general, and very informative, but the very brief section on intermarriage told me only what I was going to miss out on (and left me feeling quite depressed). The tribal issues are difficult enough to deal with when you're getting married. Perhaps it might help to see more on how to have a posivite intermarriage experience, especially when you are planning an (ostensibly) Jewish wedding and to have a Jewish family, even though your spouse is not Jewish."
3,Not so helpful for interfaith couples,"I bought it because I thought it would be more about how to throw some Jewish stuff into an interfaith wedding, but it's much less modern and way more traditional than I thought it would be."
2,Nothing new,I read so many great reviews and just didn't find it that fascinating or original! Be creative and come up with some of your own ideas...that's what I'm doing!
4,Decent TOP40 collection of 80's hits..,"Got this collection on sale, I've long had these songs from other compilations, but the track selection was good enough I used a promo code to get this. Solid from start to finish it should make a basic 80's fan happy."
5,Another purchase for my Sansa,"I enjoy a variety of music so this one was a good fit. I also have the variety discs of music from the 50's, 60's and 70's. It has lots of different artists and songs that are immediately recognizable. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,great songs,"although i mainly like the sixties and seventies, this album has most of the songs i like from the eighties."
4,Para recordar los ochenta...,"Es una muy buena recopilaci√≥n de √©xitos de los ochenta,de repente considero que podr√≠a faltar algunas canciones,pero es cuesti√≥n de gusto,a lo mejor otra persona lo escucha y dice que la selecci√≥n es perfecta...para los que vivimos esa tremenda d√©cada se los recomiendo..."
2,not as advertised,"product adverstised as karaoke cd. Not the truth. It is an audio cd only. When ordering this item, be sure you read the description carefully!"
5,80's Music,It's cool to listen to music from an interesting time of my life. The 80's were quite an adventure! Neat music during that decade.
4,GREAT 80S CD,"I LOVE 80S MUSIC. THIS CD IS PACKED WITH NOTHING BUT GOOD MUSIC. FROM ""EYE OF THE TIGER"" TO ""SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY"" ITS NOTHING BUT HIT AFTER HIT. THIS IS A GREAT PARTY CD. ITS A MUST HAVE FOR 80S FANS."
3,Good but not great,One to have if you can't get your old recods to play anymore. Some of the best form the 80's but not all.
5,excellent music,I have always wanted classic tunes from the 80's. i found them on amazon after a lot of searching.i ordered right away and got them quickly.i was not disappointed when i listened to all 8 cd's.they are packed with tons of great hit songs.i use them in home and auto.i hope to get more.the 80's produced a great music era.bruce in maine
4,I love the 80's,"I reviewed most of the 80's cd's available on Amazon and I believe this cd - plus all the ones from the same series - are the best. The selection of songs is pretty good. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because there is about 3 to 4 songs that are not really what I would consider ""hits"" (but this is true of any 80's music CDs)."
3,Love the 80's,I love the 80's and this is just another CD to add tomy collection. It is fun and brings back memories.
5,Speak Russian/Ukrainian,This is a perfect set for adoptive parents to begin to learn important phrases in order to speak with their children. This set comes with two small books and one CD. Each book (and the CD) tell you how to pronounce words and phrases in both Russian and Ukrainian. The phrases included in this set will mostly be directed to speaking to your child. I found this set very helpful and will be taking it with us on our trip.
1,"Cheap production, poor value","This is a very cheaply produced product. Basically just photocopied and stapled together. The phrase ""books"" are tiny with few pages and large print.The CD(s) are just OK, but again cheap production values with low content.I would estimate they spent $2 maximum to produce each copy. Given this, I would not complain at $10 price...but considering the price paid, it was a rip-off."
3,Not for Retirees,Good information to get ML's oriented to the terrain but somewhat dated. Mr. Begley is not shy about highlighting the benefits of his recruiting organization. Text is focused on the opportinities for Junior Officers to leverage military leadership skills and training into a competetive advantage.
4,"a ""must"" read for all survivors of evangelical upbringings!","You only ""get it"" if you have been there - it simply wouldn't make sense to anyone else (nor should it, for a ""born again"" upbringing is something understood only from the inside). My adrenaline surged at the mere thought of a Sword Drill and I realized that I no longer need to be embarassed that scripture verses, hymns, and all the books of the Bible are always at the tip of my tongue. ""Growing Up Born Again"" is a must read for all survivors (and perpetuators!) of this unique cultural experience. Too bad it is out of print . . . I know of many who would eagerly laugh and cry at the memories this book brings back to life."
4,Works great!,"I had a little trouble trying to figure out how to retrieve my files after creating them, but that was without reading instructions. Once I figured out they were all there and where they were, this little guy is awesome. And downloading the files to my laptop was super simple. The mic is super sensitive, when left alone it picked us up a floor away and you could hear the conversations. I definately recommend this product."
2,Don't believe everything you read,"I'm in medical school and wanted this recorder to be able to record all of my lectures for each day and then store them at night.This product said that it would record 27 hours of audio, but it never even came close. I could not even record a full days worth of lectures (8 hours). Several times it would just stop for no reason and I would lose half of a lecture----all of this wa extremely annoying and unless you want to upload the audio recording every 2 hours DON'T GET ONE."
1,no customer support,"It was slow learning all the operating functions as the instructions which came with it, as well as the copy downloadable at the Olympus site, were such small print they required a magnifying glass to read. Also the sound quality is very poor."
2,Less than adequate customer service,"Upon receiving my voice recorder, I attempted to learn how to use it. To my surprise, when I began looking at the instructions I noticed there were two copies in Spanish, and one in French. After contacting amazon.com about the problem, they indicated they could not help me and referred me to Olympus. Olympus sent an email with an attached copy in English. However, it was so small I could barely read it, and am not able to enlarge it to print it. Olympus indicated they would provide a hard copy of the instructions for an additional charge of ten dollars. This puzzles me. I am an English speaking American, living in a country with English as its official language. Why can I not get the copy of my owners manual in English, that I should have gotten to begin with, without paying an additional outrageous charge. The whole process has turned me against buying products online."
1,olympus digital voicerecorder,TERRIBLE product......I will probably throw it in the trash.....plastic constructionis very cheap and the sound is not audible.....total junk!
3,it's not the best product,"The price is too high, it doesn't come on itunes unless you convert it from wave to mp4 .....not great"
4,Great digiatl recorder,I carefully read the reviews of the different recorders and finally chose theOlympus WS-100 64 MB Digital Voice Recorder with USB Interfacefor its ease of use and quality. For what I need it is great. I need to record meetings in an open room (usually about 35 people). The recorder and the mic I got are perfect for this. The recorder picks up everything. It has great battery life too. I had been using an old cassette recorder (not a cheap item in its day)and the Olympus easily out shines that.
4,Slick piece of gear!,"This gem is very gentle on batteries, has outstanding pickup ability, is small enough to be convenient, but not so tiny as to defy reasonable operation. The usb connection is WELL hidden, it about made me nuts looking for it, but once I did, I was astounded at the efficiency of the design.Only drawback is that its capabilities to replay for transcription is very limited. Unlike its micro-tape counterparts, there does not seem to be any equipment or software that operates hands-free (like a foot switch). As a fall back, I was hoping that I'd be able to use the voice recognition software to transcribe, but I was not successful."
2,Cranky Little Device,"When this product works, it's great: convenient, portable, runs on one battery, and the audio quality is quite good. However, I'm no techno-idiot but this device makes me feel like one. It indicates that it is on and recording and then I go home to find that, in fact, it has NOT been recording. I also have a very hard time deleting files. Sometimes it's a snap and sometimes I need to fiddle with it for long, frustrating minutes to get it to do what I want it to. Maybe it's just me, but I'm a fan of Olympus and have never had any trouble understanding their interfaces before. I'd like to crush this under my heel sometimes, but it has made some good recordings of meetings, rehearsals and public speaking engagements for me."
3,A bit overrated,"Pros: Small and light; created wma files that I can use on both my Mac and Windows machines; comes with USB cable; can use it as a flash drive.Cons: Mine just went completely dead only 23 days after 1 year warranty expired, and not particularly heavy use; low battery warning on LCD not much use, as it has a tendency to go from half charge to nothing without warning in the middle of a one hour meeting - you need to keep your eye on it, and a spare battery in your pocket; picks up too much background noise and doesn't do a good job of picking up soft-spoken individuals in a meeting room."
3,Voice playback not very good,For the price of this unit I expected better clarity in the playback mode. It sounds very scratchy. I am disappointed with it.
2,WMA *ONLY*,"The unit works pretty well, but only supporting WMA (rather than MP3 or Ogg or some other non-Windows media format) would be nice. No point in buying it when there are other units that don't lock you in."
4,Very Good,"At first I was a little disappointed by the ""thin"" and hollow playback sound. However when I listen to my class lecture back with the headphones on the sound is really quite good.This product is really only for recording conversation, if you are looking to record anything else, such as music or sound designs, then I would get a minidisc."
4,Olympus digital voice recorder,"Recorder works well and is easy to operate. As some reviewers stated, recorder playback sound quality is marginal. Transfers of recordings to computer is easily accomblished thru USB port. Sound quality good from computer play back. I am not sure if it is just my recorder but the latch that holds the battery compartment lid closed is not reliable. Consiquently, from time to time the lid flies open and the battery shoots out. I have resorted to tapping the lid closed with duct tape."
3,Cheaply constructed,"This recorder works fine, it's just that the plastic casing is pretty flimsy. The battery compartment door won't stay closed - I've had to tape it! The controls are a tad difficult to use. On the plus side, the recording quality is good, range adequate. Not sure I'd buy another one."
1,Not for the long term,"Bought this model back in 2008 and it did the job for about a year. Then, the recording and playback quality eroded. Packed it away until recently. Rechecked and the recording and playback quality is so poor I'm researching various replacements. SO, unlike many Olympus models that just quit working, according to the Amazon reviews, mine just deteriorated over the course of a year. Usage time was approximately 30 hours. Cannot recommend Olympus lower end digital recorders."
2,Olympus WS-100 Digital Voice Recorder,The recorder has only one flaw that I could see; the speaker is quite garbled when playing back recordings. When the file is downloaded into the computer it's fine and the mic seems to be sensitive enough but on playback the voice is almost unintelligible. If the playback was clear the recorder would rate a 5 in my opinion.Sgt Gane Galitz
3,WS 100 Olympus Digital Recorder,"I receive the recorder fast.The main problem, it is hard to open to get to the USB port. It took me almost a week to finally get it to opened. I had to go to Radio Shack to get assistance. Even after that, I was not able to open it. It is difficult.Recorder sound is great. There are some excellent features."
5,great product,I was very happy with the olympus ws-100. it records great and the usb interface just makes it all the better allowing me to record and plug directly into my computer and save it there. I am very pleased.
2,Not worth the money.,"The rubber is hard, so it doesn't flex well around edges. I feel like I'm scratching the paint as well, because of the hard rubber. In the future I will purchase a Pilot water blade."
3,"Alternitive to ToteVision & Marshall Electronics, but.....","Pros;1. Foldable sturdy stand2. Inexpensive (compared to ToteVision and Marshall Electronics monitors), BUT very expensive compared to the consumer 10"" Haier ATSC?QAM TV!3. VGA input with separate video inputs that doesn't use an adapter cable (that can break)as other version do.4. Efficient switching power supply. Power consumption was slightly lower than 8"" version (1.0a at 12.5vdc)5. Black bezel.6. 800x600 resolution. Passes 4.5MHz burst, but doesn't pass 6.75MHz burst on multiburst pattern. Estimate of 550 TVL (same as 8"" version).Cons;1. So-so image quality with non computer sources. Soft image, especially with CCTV cameras.2. LCD will wash out if you raise contrast and/or brightness up too far. Settings when tested with composite sources were 70 contrast & 65 brightness.3. Color saturation level needs to be almost full (90-95).4. No 'On' indicator on unit.Added comments regarding consumer 10"" Haier TV."
4,UgetWhatUPayFor,"While the price is lower than other alternatives, I was a little disappointed with this product. The driver CD was blank so I wasn't able to use it directly out of the box. I haven't searched for them on the Internet yet so I don't know how much more difficult this is going to be.The image quality is what I expected with a touchscreen product. My experience is that they suffer a little from the touchpanel. Overall though, I am satisfied with the product. It meets my needs and fits perfectly in my car.The vendor did ship the product very quickly and it came in very good shape."
4,Take it with a grain of salt...,"Well, I'm not so sure I'd really rate this as a ""lost classic"" or anything... When this disc was made, RCA was still trying to pitch Waylon as a ""folk"" artist, and his bluesy side is almost entirely absent amid odd, sometimes stilted arrangements. A few tunes are okay, and the title track (the only song on here that had any chart action) sounds kind of like the funky country-soul that Charlie Rich was doing at the time, over on Smash Records. Basically, though, this was the wrong material and the wrong production style for Waylon -- it's a little interesting, but far from his best.3.5 stars, if that was possible."
5,Keeps my picky dogs busy,Great product! Well built and sturdy...our 90lb Boxer & 150lb Bullmastiff take turns licking it till its just a puddle. Love it!!
3,treat for dog,"I think that you could take an ice cream tub, fill it with whatever and get the same result."
5,Love the product!,"I bought this product for the 2 year old lab. He would always look ways to show his discontent of beeing left outside too long by chewing treesw or digging a holes. Kool Dogz is a great distractor. Since buying Kool Dogz for my dog, I have less holes in my yard and longer living trees.Highly recommended products for pet lovers."
3,Great idea but not good quality...,"This is a great idea and definitely keeps our two dogs busy and cool during the summer, however the metal part started to rust only after a few uses! I was very disappointed. :("
5,Have Spot Use Blue,This product can remove anything I have come across. I have used it for dried coke in a car carpet. I have used it for grease and tar.
5,Cleans Just About All Fabric Stains,"This is another one of those Blue Magic USA products that really works. [...] So far, we've used it on our truck upholstery, furniture, carpet, almost got to the dog. Easy to use, follow the instructions and in case of new stains, use this first before other cleaners. But it seems to work well on the older stains that other cleaners couldn't get out. I love made in USA products that really work. This is one of them. And Midway Auto supply is a top shelf vendor that you can rely on. Their customer service and communication if you need to reach them is great. They're reliable, fast, well-informed, and responsive to their customers."
4,Amazingly Effective Toxic Product,"This stuff will take care of any problem. It's like a miracle. It does contain some harmful chemicals, so if you are of child bearing age or have people in the house that wish to have children, perhaps you should do a little more research before purchasing. For myself, if I find myself with one more child, I'm just shooting myself, so it's not an issue."
3,I think I'm moving to digital storage,These worked ok for a while but I tried a few online storage sites and they work better. My favorite is [...]. I've also used Recipe Pro but it's limited to one computer and it's not free.
3,"Black- not red. Otherwise, fine","These cards work fine, but the background is black- not maroon. The seller should update the image to make this clear."
2,Not alphabetized,"These do the job adequately, but they are labeled peculiarly. The tabs take one third of the width of the cards, but if you arrange the cards alphabetically, the tabs do not go left, center, right. For example, Pork and Poultry are alphabetically adjacent, and both are labelled on the center tab. In fact, all meats are on the center tab.I'm going to look for a better designed set."
1,4 x 6 recipe box dividers - black & white,"Although it looks like these 4 x 6 dividers would match the Hortense B. Hewitt Wedding Accessories Damask Recipe Box Bridal Shower Invitation Gift Set, the dividers are too wide for recipe box. Also, the 1/3-cut labeled tabs on the dividers are not labeled in alphabetical order making it more difficult to locate the recipe in the box. If you attempt to alphabetize the dividers, then the tabs are not staggered, making it difficult to find the desired recipe."
4,Recipe card dividers and box,"The card dividers fit the box well and are extremeely helpful...there are separate cards for each kind of meat, salad, etc."
4,Great product,"I really liked these recipe dividers, they fit perfectly in my box. Only downside I have is they have so many different categories I could have been satisfied with 5-10 categories but they had over 20."
5,Great reading for those adventurous toddlers.,"This book is great for those adventurous toddlers. It's just the right length and not too wordy. They travel through the jungle as the book asks the question, ""Is that an elephant over there?"". The kids love to lift the flaps to find a zebra, tiger, and hippo before finding the elusive elephant. Fun for everyone!"
5,Mortal sin,"My older sister loaned me a copy of Let's Make Mary when I was in grade school in the mid-1940s. I learned that ""let's make Mary,"" a pun on ""let's make merry,"" had another meaning: Let's ""do it"" to Mary. Let's seduce Mary.I don't remember much else about the book, but I just now this minute realized that reading it was a mortal sin that I never confessed.I've read other under-the-counter books since I put in those eight years at St. Philip's, but I prefer a sophisticated form of naughtiness, such as Emily Hahn's 1930 Seductio Ad Absurdum: The Principles and Practices of Seduction.While I have your attention, Hahn's 1944 memoir, China to Me, is a classic."
5,Hardcastle 2,"I was driving and listening to the radio (KKSF) when I heard ""Bird Island"" by Paul Hardcastle. When his name was announced after the song, I thought, I have got to have this CD. I went searching the next day until I found and purchased it. I can say it is truely a great arrangement of fine music."
5,Excellent grooves,"This was my first Paul Hardcastle CD and I have since bought more. I really like the clean, funky sound. This CD always helps me mellow down after a tough day.As a Pink Floyd fan the thought of a cover of ""Money"" worried me a little, but it is excellent!"
4,Writings of an English Master,"Edgar Allen Poe was one of the best writers of his time, and this book proves it. The writings are exceptional, I'm not going to go in to much detail, because this book doesn't need it. If you are a fan of good writing, and short stories, this book is for you!"
4,garage kings !,"Throwbacks to mid-sixties american garage bands the Kings show how it's done. After an excellant surf album they return to their roots with a mix of covers and originals along with a mark lindsey cameo appearence.The cd is very well recorded with a good spatial mix and 60's instrumentation.Ialso like the snarly, menacing vocals-very authentic. If this is your bag-grab it."
3,Used this for part of my pregnancy,"First off, stretchmarks can not totally be prevented by any type of cream, body butter, or oil. However, like all other pregnant women, I still wanted to say as moisturized as possible. I have tried out several different products, and unfortunately, this body butter just wasn't for me. The scent is very strong, and if you're pregnant and sensitive to smells, then this product may not be for you. Even after you put your clothes on, you can smell the strong fragrance all day long. The smell doesn't go away until you take a shower. It smells very sweet, but it's just way too overpowering. I also found that it left kind of a sticky/pasty film or residue on the surface of my skin. It doesn't quite feel like it's being completely absorbed--even overnight. I have tried out some other products such as Mama Mia Tummy Butter and Body Shop Cocoa Body Butter and found those to be more pleasant and moisturizing. No stretchmarks so far!"
2,Does the job - but is quite greasy.,"I started used this body butter to prevent stretch marks, it did a pretty good job, however I found it to be quite greasy for that purpose. I imagine it would be good for general leg moisturizing or the like.I stopped using it when someone got me a gift of Bliss Body's Shea butter, and the consistency was MUCH thicker and butter like - and much less grease."
2,"not as good quality as the one I bought before, maybe diff. formula","I bought some of this product before at Costco in a pack of 4, loved it, was the only thing that has alleviated eczema on my hands, so I bought this product with automatic future delivery, and I am not as happy with it. I checked the list of ingredients and don't know what the actual difference is except this is not labeled organic like the original was. It is still a good product but doesn't have the slickness and penetration as the other I had purchased."
2,"Love the texture, but the initial scent is awful.","I adore Tree Hut's products, and I wanted to love this one- but I just couldn't bring myself to use it. Don't get me wrong, the consistency is true to the 'butter' name- smooth it on and it seems to melt onto the skin, making it feel quenched without leaving residue(Like my old real shea butter mixture)I am NOT sensitive to perfumes, I usually love almost everything I smell. Even then, this Brazilian Nut makes me wrinkle my nose. I wouldn't dare walk around smelling like this. It's like rotten vanilla, as someone mentioned.The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of not just the texture, but after about an hour of wearing it when the scent calms down, it smells great- but it's not something everyone will smell on you unless you're in close contact. I personally don't want to reek for the first hour. I purchased Coconut Lime (I have the scrub so I know I love that scent) and I wish I hadn't taken the chance on this scent."
5,Works great for tough dry places,This works amazing for tough dry places like your feet. And it has a great scent to it. Hard to find in stores so 3 for 15$ is a great deal!
5,FANTASTIC,"I have used this lotion for years & I love it!! where I was purchasing it stopped carrying it & I was in a panic. I searched till I found. My skin is so very soft & I always get complimented on how I smell. It has such a subtle scent, it's just perfect. My fiance works in & outdoors all year long & in the winter his hands get so chapped and raw, he started using my lotion & could not believe the difference it made. I would recommend this lotion to anyone & everyone. Most of my friends use it & all 3 of my girls use it."
5,Not a stretch mark in sight!,"I started using this body butter at the end of my first trimester, and continued to apply it religiously after getting out of the shower for the rest of my pregnancy. Not only did it keep me from itching, I also haven't gotten a single stretch mark, and I'm nearly at my due date! Plus it smells great, not too strong for a sensitive preggo nose. I am about to finish my last tub, and will definitely be both recommending and reordering this body butter in the future!"
2,Shea butter,"I had previously given this product 5 stars but they have changed the makeup of this product and it no longer has a thick, butter-like texture. It now feels like many other non-descript lotions. I had remarkable results from using the more solid type lotion, but am completely unhappy that they messed with perfection!"
4,Great for dry skin!,"I liked the pricing and the quality of this shea body butter! It is sooo good on dry skin, even the rough parts on my heels and elbows. It's thick and creamy so it lasts a real long time. Love it!"
4,Brilliant,"A real moisturizing smoothing butter, but the consistency is kind of hard to spread. It actually locks the water inside you feel really moisturized and skin so smooth. great deal of 3 jars. as for the smell, it is not overwhelming that is another thing i like about this butter"
2,Disappointed,"I received the Tree Hut Tahitian Grass Body Butter as a gift a year ago. I loved it! Just finished it, so tried the Tree Hut Coconut Lime Body Butter. The consistency is completely different, and I just don't enjoy it. Feels kind of ""synthetic,"" so I tried the Shea Body Butter, and the smell is strong and unpleasant, at least to me. Lots of people seem to like it, so may be individual preference. I wish the Tahitian Grass Body Butter in it's original formula would come back. It had a light and clean scent, easy to apply and a great consistency."
4,Elders and youngsters love this product,"As an elder at 70, I love this product. As we age the skin becomes drier and this product helps to alleviate the dryness. I would tell everyone much younger that this is the way to go to alleviate dry skin.Shea Butter rules!"
5,the best body butter ever!!,"I absolutely love this body butter. It makes my skin so soft and smells great!!I have the other scents as well, the coconut lime and the brazilian nut. I have to try the mango and other scents soon. It also lasts the whole day!! My skin isn't dry at all."
3,For the price...works great,"I'm not crazy about the coconut fragrance, but I was looking for an economical body butter that I would not feel guilty about slathering all over. :) It's not as rich as I'd like (more expensive brands) but it does the trick and for knees and elbows it's great."
5,BEST WAY TO MOISTURIZE YOUR BODY WITHOUT FEELING HEAVY OIL! SMELLS GREAT TOO!,"ZBEST WAY TO MOISTURIZE YOUR BODY WITHOUT BEING WEIGHTED DOWN. IT'S LIGHT AND GETS THE JOB DONE RIGHT! SMELLS GREAT TOO, ISN'T OVERPOWERING WITH OTHER SCENTS. WEAR IT ALONE OR WITH YOUR FAVORITE FRAGRANCE! IT'S THE VERY BEST! GREAT GIFT IDEA."
4,Great Moisturizer,"This is great - inexpensive, pleasant smelling (although the smell is mild, not overwhelming) and provides excellent moisturizing. Each little tub seems to last forever since it's so concentrated, which contributes to the value. I bought it for my friend who's getting up there in years and her skin has become more delicate and requires more intensive moisture than she can get from regular lotions. I keep some at my desk for my hands and elbows - it doesn't interfere with my ability to continue working. I do, however, find it inconvenient to use body butters on my whole body - lotions are easier, and since I'm younger lotion works fine for my skin."
5,"Good Stuff, Maynard","I use this in the morning after showering and it absorbs into the skin almost immediately for non-greasy feel. If you wait until later, it will leave a greasy feel on your hands. I started using it for sun damaged skin on my arms because they were really starting to look bad, dry, wrinkled, and itchy. This stuff turned my skin around in about 3-4 days and now after using for a month or so, I swear by it. I bought lots for my friends and family, too. All the fragrances smell great, although I'm not a big fan of the honey/almond or ginger. Do yourself a favor and order some and your skin will thank you. Also, try the Softsoap Shea Butter body wash. Very nice..."
1,warning,"Beware: I used this product on my feet and it burned and blistered.You get what you pay for and this ""bargain is a throw away. I expected Amazon to be more careful with the products that they sell. I'm VERY disappointed, to say the least."
1,These songs are awesome,"The subject says it all. However, I suggest that you, the customer, buy Kelly's full-length CD, ""Thankful"", with these two songs at the end, as opposed to this lousy single."
3,Our American Idol deserves much better,"While the hasty release of the CD single is nothing more than a shrewd marketing ploy, it is a tantalizing glimpse of the vocal prowess of the earthy Texas chanteuse who was crowned as the much-celebrated American Idol. Ms. Kelly Clarkson elevates the lackadaisical ballad material from Dianne Warren with her husky vocals and nifty pitching that transmutes the ordinary pop-tunes to powerhouse anthems with an intensity that rivals Mariah Carey's Hero and Whitney Houston's A Moment in Time. While divas nowadays resort to acrobatics with their vocals, Ms. Clarkson's mesmerizes with her sincerity. Even though this CD is not a strong justification for her talents, it certainly alludes that Ms. Clarkson can stand on her own - and should prudently avoid being ruthlessly marketed as another Britney or Aguilera. It is obvious she deserves better than this."
1,Wait for the Real Thing,"This CD is a hack-job of a single. Not only does the ""Before Your Love"" version sung by Kelly sound horrible and unprofessional, but the real single--""A Moment Like This""--is also the live (poorly recorded) version of the song. It seems like they would make a ""real"" studio recording for a single they intend for us to buy, but I guess we're stuck with the same thing as on the show. The song isn't even all that great, and Kelly is still learning just how to sing so it doesn't sound like she's trying too hard. If you really like Kelly and think you might like her songs, wait until she does some work in a studio and puts out a real CD. This one should have been left on TV."
5,Kelly is the heart and music...,I don't know what else to say except what hasn't been said.The three judges who were hired to appraise her talent shouldhave had more respect; kelly's higher on the food chain than all of them...She has a definite quiet energy and then when she performs it's this no holds barred force...I think she's beautiful and then man who snaggs that...Congrats...She looks like a peach...with a voice...I just hope the producers don't milk her and let her keep a fair share of the profits...It is not a fair world when a real positive force becomes a one-hit wonder on the basis of poor management and producing...
5,Kelly Clarkson wow's me again!!,Although this cd only contains two songs it was totally and completely worth the money spent on it! Kelly's voice is absolutely breathtaking and the songs just compliment that fact! I have listened to the songs over two dozen times and each time I seem to enjoy them more and more. For any true American Idol or Kelly Clarkson fan this a is a wonderful buy!!!
4,What an amazing voice!,"The songs are a wonderful example of Kelly's incredible voice. I love ""A Moment Like This"". I think that this is a great single and she has an amazing career in front of her. The two songs are along the pop style but are both romantic ballads. If you want to hear an incredible voice, this is the CD to purchase."
2,Booooooring!,"Kelly most certainly deserved to win American Idol 2002, but somebody please write her some songs that demonstrate her abilities better than this whitney houston-esque garbage. She proved she's got what it takes on the show (especially with RESPECT), so why are they trying to sell her as the next generic pop vacuum? Please Kelly, I beg you -- don't go there! You've got talent, use it!"
1,sad,"If you want an album where the music is written by marketing people who churned out songs for this album in morning, and went back to writing ad jingles in the afternoon - this is for you. ... I kinda feel sorry for Kelly getting all pumped up, letting her people tell her what a great idea it is to sing this ... and how she'll be a big a star if she does. Maybe she'll make enough $$ of this album so she'll have the guts to sing her own stuff on the next one, otherwise nothing good lies ahead for her. ..."
3,Could there be anymore hype?,"This girl is an average singer. There is so much hype about these ""american idols"" that everybody is getting sucked into the ""hype"" Lets see where this girl is in a year from now. If she is still around and is selling a million albums, then I will personally come back here and give everybody a real big apology. MM"
3,"Voice, talent, charisma, and hardly anything to show for it","Ok, so I watched a few shows of American Idol, but only to see if any of the contestants could actually sing. Kelly Clarkson showed everyone that she had an amazing voice and plenty of style when she sang R&B classics like ""Respect"" and ""Natural Woman,"" but now she is suddenly forced to sing two awful singles barely distinguishable from each other. I've gotten the idea from a few things I've read about her that Kelly has written plenty of her own songs, but it doesn't look like she is being given to have any opportunity to use them. American Idol has already given her a pre-packaged song, meaning that they obviously were counting on the winner of the show not having any talent and feeling that they would have to have everything ready ahead of time so the singer's own personal style wouldn't be able to come out at all. I only hope that Kelly's full length CD has more of her own material and less pre-manufactured unoriginal pop."
5,"Kelly Clarkson, The Diva of American Idol!","This single is amazing! It shows off her voice so much! I totally love it! I wish though that Kelly's album showed off her voice as much as this single dose! But Kelly Clarkson is one true Diva! I want her to win a grammy so bad! And she should have won that Grammy she was up for! Kelly Clarkson will always be a diva of American Idol, and beyond! I give her single 5 stars, and her album 5 stars!"
4,"Hey, I bought into the hype","I watched the show. I love the song. But I think that I like this CD because I like the journey that Kelly Clarkson took to get this single released. My girlfriend likes the song and we play it because it's a pop love song. Let's bring this whole American Idol thing back to reality. Kelly is a great person and I personally hope that she will endure in a very competitive music industry. Score one for the average young lady with a great singing voice. But I would wait until her full length CD comes out in time for Christmas, they will probably include these two songs on it. It also looks as if the American Idol greatest hits has these two songs on it, plus ""Natural Woman"" which Kelly just rocked during the show. Did I buy this CD? I sure did! Was it a waste of money? It sure was! Only because I'm also going to buy the Greatest Hits and Kelly's full length. Did FOX Network get me to buy into the hype? They sure did."
3,A Moment Like This,"Well, this song is definately better than ""Anything Is Possible."" But I feel that when Kelly sang this live on the show for the first time (I was there), it was so much better than this recording. But look, it has gone all the way to number one. And you don't have it??? Why not? BUy it with the American Idol Greatest Moments CD. ""Before Your Love"" is a beautiful song! I listen to it over and over for hours."
3,She is a ...,"Her songs sound like I heard it before somewhere else before. She needs better lyrics to it something to make us think about it for a long long time this song will come and go like all the other songs I heard by other singgers. Her voice is pretty but nothing to remember sounds like alot of other singgers I already heard. She will probabily go to country music on us.... The guy that won with her on American Idol is her boyfriend the one with that weird hair style. I also hate American Idol you should not watch it. It is stupid and I hope it goes off the air. Paula Abdul can't even sing as good as this girl,but alot of other people can sing better then Kelly Clarkson alot. She dose not even compare to Mariah and Whitney or Patty Labelle. Her voice is little compared to theres. I will never watch American Idol again and I hope you all stop watching it to. What happen to the old way of finding singgers that means not on T.V."
3,It's not her fault...,The only reason i give three stars because she has an incredible voice. i am hoping her debut album has more edge and more soul then these boring love ballads. kelly's voice is so much more then these dumb songs. i don't recommend buying this..but i would buy the album.
2,blah,"I was a BIG Kelly supporter when American Idol was on. I was thinking she was one of the greatest singers ever. I now realize I was just caught up in the hype. Now that American Idol is over and the craze has died down, I really see nothing special about Kelly's voice. Especially on this CD. Her voice sounds so flat and husky. I thought she sounded much better live. At least she did in my memory. The two songs on this single are terribly written. Even the most hard core Kelly fan MUST admit that the only reason why she is such a success right now is because of the TV show. Right now she's got a so-so power ballad playing on MTV while the queen of power ballads Celine Dion, or even LeAnn Rimes, wont even be considered. Does this make sense? No. Once American Idol 2 comes around absolutely nobody, not even the hard core fans, will care about Kelly. I can guarantee you that."
1,Mass produced pap,"The American Idol TV program, although amusing, produced no good music whatsoever. Hey Kelly-- sounding like Mariah or Celine is not a good thing."
1,A Star Isn't Born. It's Manufactured.,"It's only appropriate that Kelly Clarkson, the winner of the mammothly popular ""American Idol"" TV show, is billed as the next Celine Dion. Like the Canadian vocalist, this 20-year-old Texan has respectable pipes, but there's something curiously Vegas-like about her. Maybe it's this song, which has a predictable melody and Hallmark-trite lyrics. Devoid of any craft or surprises, it shot right to No. 1 on the charts due to incredible first-week sales, showing once again the power of the hype machine. To paraphrase an old saying, ""the devil finds work for 'Idol' hands."""
1,You must be joking,The over-enthusiastic use of pitch correction software and full-on compression makes her sound like a robot. Can she actually sing? You'll never know from listening to these songs. I suppose if you don't know anything about music or recording it might be passably pleasant. Look for Ms. Clarkson to make frequent excuses for poor live performances where an ATR-1 can't be slipped into her vocal signal chain.
5,Wow,"Kelly is totally awesome! This is a Great C.D.! Especially ""A Moment Like This!"" Rock on Kelly!!"
5,She's the Best,I guess you either love her or hate her. I love her. She's the best thing that's happened to me musically in a very long time. Very refreshing. I can't wait for my next Kelly fix.
3,Wonderful Voice (but just so so songs),"Kelly has the voice of the title she has been given: that of American Idol. However, the music -- namely the lyrics -- carrying her through the portal of stardom is marginal in quality. I say this about most pop music, but in Kelly's case, it is especially true. ""A Moment Like This"" is a nice sentiment, but the lyrics don't go beyond the title and never approach any sort of moving story - the fate of most pop music. ""Before Your Love"" is no different and the lyrics are worse. They revolve around cliche' and never give us anything of substance. Now, mind you, this has NOTHING to do with Kelly's talent - which is stupendous. She has a firm hold on a great career and I look forward to seeing her blossom as one of the most talented recording artists of our time. I only wish her first recordings were marvelous in more ways than merely her voice."
5,"Kelly Is As Usual, AWSOME!","Paula one of the judges on American Idol said ""Kelly could make Mary Had A Little Lamb"" a #1 hit. Well I think she just made ""A Moment Like This A #1 Hit"" and ""Before your Love"" is right behind it."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a CD you must have. If you love artists with strong vocals like Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, you will love Kelly Clarkson. This is a young artists that has talent, not just a voice that can be mixed in a studio. This is a lady that is going to make it big and in a big way. Superb!!!"
5,Phenomenal Singer.,"Yes, there are better songs out there. But there is no better singer than Kelly Clarkson.The magic about this phenomenal singer is that you can ACTUALLY LISTEN to anything she sings, and be totally captivated by the performance.What an incredible talent!"
4,very good voice; too bad the songs aren't up there too,"What I liked: Kelly Clarkson has a very lovely voice; Good strenghth and a fair amount of range; it's been a long time since we've had a singer like her. The other great thing about Kelly is she's no clone. She isn't trying to be Mariah or Celine. What I didn't like: the songs are too repititive the much better one being Moment. I'm not sure what is the reason for why these songs to me at least, aren't worth more than two listens. It doesn't stir me like the Grammy debuts of other singers e.g. Mariah Carey, Leanne Rimes, Christina Aguilera. I suggest you borrow this single from someone else before deciding if you want your own copy. It might be worth waiting for the entire album when hopefully they can come up with at least one or two heart stopping songs."
3,"Kelly, Kelly, Kelly","There isn't anything that hasn't been said about this girl. She sings great, she belts with the best of them and this single puts it all on display.The songs are cheesy for sure but she sells it better than anyone in the business."
4,ignore the songs -- it's all about the voice,"I gave this 4 stars solely for the voice -- big, soulful, and rich. One can only hope that Kelly Clarkson will have the opportunity to make some of her own choices in her career. Her voice is truly superlative, and American Idol has given her unprecedented exposure. She's really at her best singing live, but she did a great job with the singles ... despite the fact they are disappointingly mediocre songs. Here's hoping that she is able to create her own music and not be packaged into whatever might be MTV- or VH1-friendly at the time. There are too many beautiful voices singing the wrong material already."
3,"Alright, but not great.","...Now, as I listen to her singles and the music they put on the greatest hits CD, I am less impressed. She is alright... but I think she sounds like she's yelling half the time and its dangerous for her voice. She has a nice voice, don't get me wrong, and I think that, as she learns better technique, she'll sound even better... but for now, I'm going to quietly put away this CD and not listen to it anymore.With all that said, i have to say that I love the songs. I don't care much if the lyrics are cheesy and sappy. Hey, they speak to me, even if they are a product of mass market appeal. She does a good job singing them and I would recommend that people get the cd if they are fans."
1,Cheesey Vegas style at its Finest.,"Both songs Kelly Clarkston is releasing are American Idol song tracks.This is not art/music-this is a COMMERCIAL for American Idol.Kelly Clarkstons' vocals are so ordinary and predictable it is unbelievable-going from a soft whipser to a full out belting of advertising for American Idol with ""A moment like this"".She is a watered down version of Whitney Huston/Mariah Carey/Celine Dion with out any of the Soul they possess.Kelly Clarkston tried getting a record deal on her own before American Idol came along and now I see why nobody bothered to sign her on.There is a huge difference between a 'singer' and an 'artist' and Kelly Clarkston is no artist.Although...I hear a lot of corporate America is willing to sign her up to hock a few products for them.Just like Britney Spears sells soda Kelly is selling American Idol-but I am not buying it.I will save my money for true music of our generation-music with character/soul/talent and genuine feeling."
1,WHAT?,"Come on....my dog can write better lyrics then this. I wouldn't pay for this single if my life counted on it. These 2 songs are so dumb, my ears bleed if I have to listen to them."
4,Fabulous Voice,"Kelly Clarkson has a great voice. Such a breath of fresh air over the other ""music"" dominating the scene right now. *mainly hip hop.* She is obviously going to be huge and this single proved it by hitting #1 here in the US and setting a record on Billboard by jumping from #52 to #1 in a single week. ""A Moment Like This"" is a gorgeous ballad and Kelly's voice is perfect for it. The other song ""Before Your Love"" isn't quite as good *hence the 4 star rating* but is still pleasant enough. I can not wait until her debut album!"
3,Not Convinced Yet,"While I think that Kelly Clarkson has alot of talent, she needs voice training. Generally, she sounds as though she is screaming -there is a certain fullness or ""velvet"" quality missing. She displays much emotion and passion but, at times, her voice is not very pleasant to listen to.My advice is that she develop her voice with the help of a professional coach."
3,"American ""Idol"" sings radio drivel","To begin, no, Dianne Warren didn't write these songs. They're weak attempts at the style, maybe rejects written by Dianne wanna-be's ( a medical condition, itself, for sure ).The songs are typical top-40, space-taker bland. The kind that an emotionally-attached, sentimentalist view will see as stellar, but an objective view would cast aside as pure radio fodder.Don't get me wrong, Kelly has a wonderful voice. It's just a shame the material they gave her.First listen, the production sounds shoddy at best as well. The vocal on ""Before Your Love"" sounds like stiff, hollow cardboard stapled to a karaoke backing track. ""A Moment Like This"" shines a little better, but still sounds destined for the land of late-night adult-contemporary sandwiched between two Phil Collins songs.Please, she won the contest. Give her a chance. Don't ruin her dream by trying to do an immediate popularity cash-in or by turning her into the next Saline Demon ( one is bad enough, thanks)."
1,Really Weak,"Kelly has a great country grand ole oprey kind of voice, but these songs are just weak. I can't believe that these are the best songs that could be written for her. After having a breakout show, they've blown it by writing 2 really weak songs. Sure they are doing well on the charts, but that's only due to the show's momentum. The songs have no legs. A year from now, you'll never remember these songs. As for Kelly, her career will have no legs unless they hook her up with Nashville since country is really in her wheelhouse. She's not a pop singer. She's just to plain Jane and fat to compete with the made up popstars like Brittany etal."
4,"FANTASTIC VOICE OUTSHINES ""SO-SO"" POP SONGS","Yes...like millions of Americans I got hooked on American Idol and could hardly wait for Kelly Clarkson to win the gold. Her first single is very strong, her voice an inspiration in spite of the mediocrity of the songs written specifically for the Idol winner. I can't wait to see where this excellent singer takes her career next and what songs her first album will consist of. My only complaint at all is the style of songs and delivery thus far...it sounds uncomfortably reminiscent of Celine Dion and Mariah Carey (as if we need another one of those.) In the words of the infamous Idol judges, I'm waiting for Kelly Clarkson to step forward with her own unique sound and style and ""make it your own, girl!"""
3,Boring songs but good voice,"This cd is good. But the 2 songs that kelly sang ( before ur love and a moment like this ) are kind of boring! Its not kellys fault, its the songs. i mean Kelly has a great voice... but those 2 songs do nothing for her but what do i know, i'm just a listner and thats just my opinion. But if u want a bigger audienece GIVE KELLY SOME GOOD SONGS TO SING."
5,Kelly Clarkson is the next big thing!,"Two soft love ballads are starting Kelly Clarkson's amazing career to a roaring start! These songs, ""A Moment Like This"" and ""Before Your Love"" are largely addictive and very beautiful. They are a must have for all those who appreciate great singers."
5,Kelly Rocks!!!!,"I watched American Idol all summer long, and from the very beginning Kelly was my fave. She has such an amazing talent and personality. I bought this CD the day it was released, got the American Idol DVD, American Idol Greatest Moments, and most of the magazines Kelly's been featured in. And I can't wait to go out and buy her CD on November 26!! I know it's gonna be so great. But if you search for Justin Guarini, he has a CD-single AND an album already known to have been released. How weird is that? His single doesn't come out until around when Kelly's album comes out, but you can already preorder his? I wish you could preorder Kelly's cuz I would get it!!!"
2,"Ok, But very old","My 3 /win2k systems do not see or work with this unit. My NT4.0 sp6 does see it and works fine. Dlinks tech support had me add Netwre Client and NWLink Protocols to my Win2k systems, would still not work, they then told me to update the printservers firmware to 1,38, but this is not available on their site anywhere. This thing was made in 1997 ! and has not been updated to work with newer OS's. If you only have NT 4 systems go ahead and get it. But if you have any NEW systems (OS) then pass it by."
3,The BEST TASTING SOUP RECIPES,"If you love to make your own soup, you want this book, if you love excellent tasting soup, you want this book. Easy to follow recipes, excellent tasting soups, you cannot go wrong purchasing this book. These soups can be eaten all year round. This Soup Cook Book makes an excellent gift."
1,Vegatarian Soup Cookbook,This was the right product but it was so worn that I couldn't give it as a gift.
5,A Cookbook to Keep,"I've just ordered my third copy of this book, having worn out two little paperbacks. I bought my first copy many years ago and was captivated. This cookbook is a perfect blend of memories and recipies--one doesn't overpower the other. I've cooked most of the recipes in the book, and their cornbread recipe has become my standard for home and 'pot luck'. I've bought many copies of this book for gifts. Mine have been worn out from loaning to friends. A great achievement on the part of the writers. A book to keep."
5,A Great Surprise of a Book!,"I come from a family who loves to eat and cook, and my brother (a chef and bistro owner) has recommended a wide variety of books to me over the years. This book I found myself at a Half Priced Bookstore! Lucky me. I was not expecting that it would become one of my most valued kitchen friends. The stories are wonderful but the wide range of recipes is really amazing. From ice cream to how to make face cream! My favorite all time is the Refrigerator Rolls using mashed potatoes. They come out moist and buttery and is perfect for cinnamon rolls and special occasions. Now I am picking up a copy for my brother!"
4,Down home cookin',"I purchased this book in hardbound when it came out years ago. I used it until the pages fell out. Now, I'm older and can't consume so much butter and sugar other artery clogging ingredients, but for special occasions I pull this baby out and go to town. Mmmm-mmm-good!"
5,A must for the experienced and novice cook.,This book makes a great gift for those who love to cook as well as those learning to cook. The historical data makes for interesting reading. The receipes bring back fond memories of our own family gatherings. I hope the publisher will decide to re-print one day.
5,Great even just for reading!,"This is as interesting as a ""reading"" book as it is as a cookbook. The recipes are very creative, too. A lot of ""homestyle"" cookbooks just seem to be ""1,001 things to do with canned soup"" but this one isn't like that at all--the recipes are genuinely interesting and are varied, from ice cream to homemade wine to Sunday dinner."
5,Family Classic- For everyone,This book is simply put...A family classic. I was given the one my grandmother owned....It's full of amazing recipes and a interesting story. This book is so wonderful...You'd b a fool not to get it!
5,Loved Since 1992,"I bought this cookbook in July,1992. I was 23 years old. I still have the same paperback copy I bought so many years ago. The mac and cheese recipe is so close to the mac and cheese my great aunt from Mississippi used to make. That's why I bought the book. My mother-in-law loves ""my"" macaroni and cheese and spied the cookbook in my kitchen and said how much she liked it. Well, she's getting her own copy for Christmas."
3,.,I liked the characters but it is very hard to believe that people who are supposedly SO smart have no idea how babies are made...
5,The New England Clam Shack Cookbook,"I bought The New England Clam Shack Cookbook for 2 reasons. First, I have several of Brooke Dojny's cookbooks and know the recipes to be easy and reliable. They do work. Second, I live in Maine and my family has a great fondness for clam shacks. Now, during the winter, when the clam shacks are closed, we can have fried clams and chowder at home. The bonus is the wonderful descriptions of the people who cook all of that great food."
4,Great recipes! Would like to see more from CT restaurants.,"This is a great book. So far, we have made the clam chowder from the Seahorse Tavern, and it was superb. Just like the clear chowder I grew up eating. However, aside from two Connecticut restaurants, the author virtually skips over the whole state. There are so many excellent clam shacks and seafood places in CT, and I'm hoping the 2nd edition (set to come out in May 2008) will include more recipes from my former home state. But other than that, no complaints. In addition to great recipes, the book is a lot of fun to read through. The author includes lots of fun facts and anecdotes."
1,don't buy this oven,"A few weeks after I bought mine, the top heating element (light) went out. Now several months later the bottom heating element went out - making the oven completely useless. I'd skip this oven and choose another."
4,Jazz Starter,"The Rough Guide Essential Jazz cd's is a fine pocket book that goes through 100 jazz cd's that are a nice sampling of the genre. The selections all are solid choices and unlike other entries in this series, jazz artists rarely, if ever, release greatest hits compilations, so the cd's are all studio or live efforts. The reviews of each album are short and to the point and provide a good overview for people who aren't jazz fans, but would like to get into this musical style."
2,Wicked Child,"Vargas Llosa surprises me with this book. The language, as always, is challenging and exquisite. What everyone seems to be missing is how wicked this child is. He had it planned all along. There is no innocence here. At first I thought the more dubious character was the father, but the more I read, the more sane he became. In the relationship between Lucrecia and Fonchito, I kept asking myself: Who is the adult here? This is child abuse and pedophilia, albeit with a more than willing participant. A very disturbing story and I am not faint of heart."
1,Una decepcion,"Que tristeza. Mario Vargas Llosa era uno de mis escritores favoritos. Quiso explorar el tema de la literatura erotica, pero nos entrega una historia que no va para ningun lado y que nos trae, en cambio, descripciones grotescas, detalladas, vulgares y sin sentido, sobre temas como el defecar, a lo que le dedica varias paginas. No lo recomiendo."
5,Non-stop from Cover to Cover!,"Excellent vivid description of such hidden emotions as sensuality, passion, romance, eroticsm, touch, foreplay, desire, lust, and more. A lesson is sensuality! Never realized Mario had such hidden talent; must be a professor in the art of love-making. The structure and form is, like all his books, of superior style... the ending is somehow unexpected!!!"
2,This isn't what I remembered...,"I first saw this on late night television in the early '70's. I was watching TV with the sound off and listening to music on the stereo - I'm pretty sure it was the Allman Brothers Live at Fillmore East - and I came across this movie and was fascinated. I thought it was brilliant and couldn't wait to tell friends about it. But when it ended I didn't quite catch the title and I couldn't find anything more about it until last year when I stumbled across the original release name, that being ""What Happened at Campo Grande"" and it all clicked. And after all those years I have no idea of what I saw in this. Standard dumb English comedy involving a pair of bumbling toy soldier salesmen caught up in a real revolution in a banana republic somewhere. Maybe I need to try it again with the sound off...."
3,Cool Parent!!!,As a parent of 3 I bought EVERGIRL FOR MY eight year old daughter.SHE LIKES the game she is playing it right now . It lets you do sports customize a character and design fashions.If I would rate this game I would give it a 3 star!!!ps.I think it could have more choices and more creative...
5,Great branding tool,"Recieved my branding tool and on first inspection the tool is top quality. With a little testing I found the recommended time to heat to temperture was a little long as I burnt the test piece of wood, but that was no fault of the tool as I could have had the torch to close. Overall a great tool."
5,Lasagne Perfection,"This is the best Lasagne dish, bar none. One Caveat- it's non-standard size so you have to go to the trouble of making wet noodles fit, not a difficult task. I transferred the remaining ingredients to a 9X5 1/2 Pyrex meat loaf dish & cooked 'em at the same time. Clean-up of this dish is 1/4 the effort of the Pyrex dish. Simply soak for about 15 minutes in hot water- it seems nothing will stick to it- and just wipe it out. You will not be dissapointed in this Lasagne dish."
3,Becoming Human,"A character-driven variant of the classic SF theme of the nature of humanity.This is potentially a wonderful story, with high drama, politics, and interesting interpersonal relationships. For me, the execution was at times overly opaque and oblique, so that I spent too much time trying to figure out the political system and why the characters were doing what they did. I can imagine this having been a fantastic novel if it had been written with a bit more grace and depth.Nevertheless, it's a promising first novel with some interesting ideas and a generally good treatment of characterization."
3,The B&W episodes are better,The black and white episodes are better. The show started sliding with the color eps. It's still a good series and I recommend it for fans of Roger Moore and classic 60's spy/action shows. The packaging is bulky. I would like to see this released with condensed packaging.
5,Excellent transfer onto DVD,"As usual, A&E did a splendid job transfering the series onto DVDs, the color is vibrant and the image is very sharp, flesh tone is excellent. Readers should read other reviews on the story line. As in all TV series made in this period, it is very obvious (due to the great transfer) to the viewer when the shots are taken in indoor studio, however, this does not take away from the story line. The extras are minimal. Currently, I have several box sets of 60s and 70s British TV series put out by A&E and I am extremely happy with the transfer."
1,Misinterpreted and horribly written,"This novel has been glorified as a great call-to-arms against the destruction of the environment. What most people don't seem to get is that the book is actually Abbey's defense of his own hypocritical pseudo-environmentalism. Abbey lived almost his entire life in cities and enjoyed driving big gas-guzzling cars and indulging in all the wasteful conveniences of modern society. Notice that the ""heroes"" in this book don't give a second thought to spreading their OWN pollution and litter through the wilderness. They only get upset when other people do it. Just like Abbey. On top of this, the prose is wretched. I know that Abbey intended this book to be semi-comic, but was he really shooting for the tone of a third-rate romance/adventure novel? I suspect that he was trying to hide his own lack of writing talent behind a mask of ""cheesy humor"", the equivalent of tripping over a step and saying: ""I meant to do that!"""
4,Fun stuff!,"Just reread this after about 10 years, such fun stuff. Abbey is a sheer treat (The Fool's Progress is my favorite, plus the essays). In this day and age of George -the hell with nature- Bush, the younger/'stupider' this book should be manditory reading. Let it bleed! Let loose the rivers! Enjoy...j"
2,Did I miss something?,"i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it. but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational. i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated. while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering. the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers."
1,Pure male fantasy,"This book is pure male fantasy, with ideas of absolute power. There is a fawning young beautiful woman who acts as admiring helpless geisha -- freely sexual and cooperative, hiplength hair of course, and she does not want a commitment. The hero rapes her at one point.In adolescence, boys mistake the power feelings of testosterone for the ability to paint a mustache on Smokey the Bear. Although Abbey has certain keen observations, he doesn't develop them in an interesting way. His characters are one dimensional. He disrupts the peacefulness of the desert much more than any billboard would.I'm not sure what is being rescued by this fictional batch of heroes -- however, if a woman is married to a man who has outsize ego and power needs, she can read this book to better understand his world view."
2,Very disappointing book....,"After reading ""Fool's Progress"", I began to become interested in Edward Abbey's other books. So I read ""Monkey Wrench Gang"", probably one of his better known ones, and I came away from it quite disappointed. Yes, I know it was the 70's, when it was written, but did we really need a stereotypical J.A.P feminist and a flat ex-Green Beret, who loves violence and to litter. The sentiments that the dam at Glen Canyon ruined the Colorado seem right, but that was the book's only strength. By the time I got to the end, I didn't care what happened to the characters, although I give it credit for not being a ""hollywood"" ending."
2,Abbey missfires,Abbey's a better non-fiction writer than he is a fiction writer. Redundant events and emotions. Was hard to get past the middle of it.
4,Abbey Lives!,"I am reluctant to give this book five stars, because it is really not all that well-written, and certainly does not compare to Desert Solitaire. However, it is a timeless book, and is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago. The Canyonlands area (which is one of the most beautiful regions in the world) is still being threatened by morons who want to build condominiums all along the Colorado River and destroy what little remains of the wild places in America. Therefore, in spite of my belief that Edward Abbey is not a great fiction writer, I feel that this book will always be worth reading, so long as it continues to inspire people to fight against the senseless desecration and commercialization of our nation's wilderness."
3,ecoterrorist's delight,"This is the gleeful side of ecoterrorism, take it or leave it. Abbey's book is more mischievous than exciting, more adventure than political manifesto. The story, which traces a colorful group of environmentalists as they sabotage developers' project, works reasonably well as a story, but I was in the end somewhat dissatisfied. I really do wish there was more in it to justify the sabotage -- more that could persuade me that destroying others' property is merited by developers' actions. Abbey does a better job of this more meditative type of writing in _Desert Solitaire_."
3,"Lowbrow, unapologetic, fun, and subversive.","The good: beautiful descriptions of the desert. ""Scenery"" doesn't do justice to Abbey's prose poems.The bad: Bonnie Abbzug. The book actually gives her less consideration and less respect than the scenery. Naming her after a famous congresswoman just makes it worse.The weird: Hayduke. Doesn't respect anybody -- including his fellow monkeywrenchers -- and is quite comfortable using sabotage and explosives to advance his cause. No compromises, no limits, a bias towards action, and no regrets. Great if you're on his side (but remember -- he's not on yours). As it happens, I'm not, but I still enjoyed reading his exploits."
5,Monkeywrench gang.,"Ed Abbey was extremely prophetic in this novel, it's too bad that there weren't more individuals willing to do what it took to save the desert southwest from industrialization when the plans of the corporate elite for the rape of this part of our heritage were in their infancy.It is a book well worth the time it takes to read. It will anger you at times, but it will also make one think. It made me ponder what could have been, if only we had been slaves of the land instead of the dollar."
3,"Good story, predictable humor","This was a fun book to read - an environmentalist's equivalent of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".I do take issue with those who thought the humor was ""uproarious"" or ""hilarious"". It was cute, and it was funny, but really the humor is predictable - no better or worse than any witty conversation you'd expect between coworkers or friends."
1,Seeing through Abbey,"I read this book in the early 80s when I had just moved to Moab, Utah, where Abbey lived for a while and where he worked for the Park Service. I was appalled by what others have already noted, the glib tacit approval of vandalism.Abbey was a talented and entertaining writer and could weave magic out of the landscape. I am one of the people who moved to Moab because of Desert Solitaire, a decision I never regretted, altho I left when the town became ruined for anyone but the very rich - See Brave New West by Jim Stiles. But in all Abbey's work, not just Monkey Wrench Gang, a nasty streak surfaces now and then, and at some point I quit reading him."
4,Fun...and a classic read,"Experience a new outlaw justice in this classic Abbey work. Although you may groan at the sometime sophomoric humor, the storytelling outs and the environmental questions are worth considering, even when voiced by terrorists."
4,"Funny, adventurous and insightful.","A great story about four mischevious people trying to halt the ecologically destructive progress of mankind around them. From seizing up bulldozer engines or driving them off cliffs, to blowing up coal train bridges, and other great stunts, it's ALL in here. A great adventure. Another fine book in the Abbey realm."
5,Monkey Wrench Gang,The product was in excellent condition. The shipping time was incredibly fast. I ordered the book on a Friday night and it arrived on a Monday.
1,Disappointing,"I thought this story would be about the beauty and the enjoyment of the desert southwest. Instead its a book about the glorification of vandalism and the destruction of property. Desert Solitude is a much better book, its hard to believe they are by the same author. If Abbey had only wrote the Monkey Wrench Gang I doubt he would have been so famous."
1,An Eco-Terrorist Manifesto...,"When I first read this as a teenager, I thought it was a wonderful tale of civil disobedience. However, in retrospect, I recognize that this work represents a clarion call for the eco-terrorism we have been witnessing for the past few decades.The plot follows a cadre of misfits and criminals as they seek to do harm to private developers who are ostensibly ruining the natural landscapes of the American west. The gang mechanistically destroys private property, and the author seems to have no compunction about glorifying this activity as some kind of vague, contradictory, directionless, and unnamed cause.In short, I would _not_ recommend this book to anyone--except, perhaps, as a means to gain insight into the liberal mindset that drives the eco-terrorist movement. I would much rather read (and recommend) books with a bona fide moral purpose--where the emphasis is on productive genius and its benefits, not destruction as an end in itself."
2,Good book but arrived damaged.,"This is a fine book, but unfortunately it arrived damaged. It looked like it had been exposed to water, because the pages and cover were curled and wrinkled.It looked as though the damage happened prior to shipment because the box was in good condition."
2,The Monkey Wrench Gang (Edward Abbey series),"Boring and unbelievable. Do not recommend. I did not finish the book, which I almost never do! Blah! Boring, not worth the buy!"
3,Have not finished this book yet. It is getting dull,"I purchased the book over a month a go and still have not finished it. The plot is getting tiresome so if I have nothing else to read I pick this up. The southwest US as it is described is on target, but the story line, not so much"
5,This is my favorite book of all time,"Other than Desert Solitare (by Abbey), this is the best story love for the planet ever written. Just do us all a favor and accept it for the metaphor that it is"
3,Don't Read It for Its Literary Value,"The story is fun, though, especially if you're familiar with the remote desert of Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. The dialogue was really terrible at times and the characters were interesting but strained credulity. The meat of the story is the landscape and the political implications of the tale. This book would make a perfect read on a backpacking trip in the Glen Canyon Wilderness area."
3,"Enjoy the book, but realize that you probably wouldn't like the people in it . . . I'm related to them","I grew up in Utah at about the time this book was written, and in one way I love it. I knew everyone in it--the whole odd-ball collection of people who populated the West before everyone seems to have moved there. (Although I think the best depiction of this world was The Milagro Beanfield War, not on Kindle, and a sadder and truer story.) But I cannot help but think that the modern environmental movement, which is pleased to call this its Bible, would probably call the cops on both Hayduke and Smith . . . and go on vacation to a luxury at something run by the ilk of the Bishop of Blanding."
5,Hayduke Does Live,"So what if the writing is not Steinbeckien, the story is absoutly unbeatible. I have probably read the book 20 times, and it still sends shivers up my spine. This book will make you want to blow up a Dam; for better or worse few books are so effective in their call to action. As Abbey said, ""those who follow my advice will be jailed, those who fail to, will be run over by a Mitsubishi Bulldozer."""
5,rooted for the bad guys,"Loved the characters, plot, loved the beginning, ending and everything in between. It was a page turner.I've been to the areas described and they were described right on."
3,Not as useful as I'd expected,"I'm a Swiss Army Knife and Leatherman Tool fan, so I was very interested to find a similar tool for my gardening needs. Unfortunately, the fact that this costs a lot less than a good Leatherman tool is reflected in the limitations of this tool. When I recently had my first opportunity to try and use it to cut off a small branch, I was quickly forced to halt the attempt and complete the task with a real pruner. I'll still keep the tool, but won't rely on it instead of separate good quality tools as I can with a Leatherman or Swiss Army product."
4,"Solid, simple, effective and practical","If you are looking for a simple, effective, biblical and practical book, this book is for you. I have brought this book into my church and used in Sunday School and translated it into Turkish language and it is about to be published in Turkey. This book is a short summary of 'Systematic Theology'. I would recommend another book which would contribute to this book called 'God's Big Picture'."
1,the single worst product i have ever purchased,"it really is a shame that amazon doesn't allow you to award 0 stars to a product. There is printer is inexcusably bad. As others have mentioned, it doesn't suck up paper properly, it sometimes randomly shuts off, and the print quality isn't great either. I will never buy another HP product again."
1,Worst printer ever made.,"You do not want this printer. Paper pickup is unpredictable, color image is poor (even with new cartridges), and it occassionally just shuts OFF."
2,"some good, some bad","Pros: Great print quality, nice diagnostic tools (for Mac & PC), can print 11x17-size prints, stingy with ink. Post-Script compatable (Windows & Mac OS9).Cons: Does not ship with a USB cable, frequently eats #10 envelopes, ink cartridges are ridiculously expensive, does not print as fast as other comparable printers, does not print well with HP glossy photo paper. W/respect to the last con, the rollers have a hard time ""grabbing"" the photo paper. I usually go through 5 sheets of photo paper with the photo 1/2 on it before one sheet that works. Then again, maybe that's part of HP's master plan to make $$$ on photo paper..."
2,Same here - will not GRAB photo paper.,"Like many others I bought this printer because I wanted to make good A3 prints for display. For the first 6 months it worked without a hitch (Dell PC). After that it started misfeeding paper - especially shiny photo paper - which is exactly what I bought it to print!!Now it will only grab the cheapest quality paper - anything with even a slight shine just will not go through. I have tried cleaning the rollers and all the 'fluffed up' areas inside the machine, but all to no avail.This was not a cheap printer, and I have to say I would think long and hard before buying any printer from HP again.It rates 2 stars, because it was OK in the beginning, and it will still print 'ordinary' paper, but nothing more because I now have to buy another printer to do my A3 photos!"
2,Will not work with photopaper,"I bought this printer because I needed 11x17 capability and it is doing great for that. However, trying to print on photo paper is an incredibly frustrating experience. The feed rollers appear to have difficulty pulling the paper in. 8 1/2 x 11 sheets will cut of the first inch or so and smaller, photo size cards will not print at all."
4,Reliable machine,"After reading these reviews, I must say I have experienced none of the problems these people describe. It does not eat envelopes. It prints fast and well. Cartridges are expensive but I had it over a year before I needed one. I would still recommend it."
1,I WANT TO THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW !,"I do a lot of printing. I can no longer work with photo paper or thick paper, because I get to upset with this printer. I have turned down a lot of work , so this printer has made me lose money.HP GIVE EVERYONE A REFUND THAT ASK, AND I'M ASKING.DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT."
1,Great except for one key defect,"This printer prints beautifully. The tragic thing about this printer is that a few months after buying it, it won't turn on anymore. If you go to cnet or the HP website, you will find that many people have experienced this. Unfortunately it happened to us right after the warranty ran out, so we were stuck with it. Not a good thing for a product with this price tag..."
5,"Great Series, suggest it to others",The school library had all of this series except for the last two books. So I purchased them to donate. It seems as though lots of kids are reading them and enjoying looking forward to the next in the series.
1,don't waste your money,This case just attracts dust and makes your Ipod look dirty. I was very disappointed....a waste of money.
3,Not best for travelers,"If you are just visiting Virginia Beach for a few days, this book has a lot of information that you don't need and not much of the information that you do need. There are no detailed maps and very little tourist type info. Despite the title, this book covers a much larger area than just Virginia Beach. The restaurant guide is very good, and it is obvious that considerable effort was expended in compiling all of this information. If you are considering a move to Virginia Beach, this is an excellent resource. Otherwise, another travel guide that includes Virginia Beach would probably be a better bet."
4,Two of the three movies are great!,"Office Space and My Cousin Vinny are worth the $21.99 I paid for the blu-ray set. I have never seen Super Trooper, but it can't be all that bad."
3,herbie live,let's see Freddie Hubbard - Ron Carter - Jack DeJohnette - Eric Gale and Stanley Turrentine! an obvious bootleg Herbie plays Rhodes Piano there's no recording information about where and whentrack 1.

1,NO Seiko Warranty for this seller,My Watch stop working after 5 1/2 Months. Called Seiko and shipped to them they wanted $91.85 for the repair because they said this seller is not a SEIKO official dealer. Amazon said Iam on my own since it more than 90 days.I have got no response form this seller K.G. Compamy.
3,"Not a bad book, but not a great book, either","Doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know, francophiles will already be aware of everything this book has to offer. But for the completely naive, it could be somewhat valuable."
2,Don't Bother,"Some Culture Shock books are great--the one written about Sweden, for example, is spot on in every respect--but I found the France book neither engaging nor helpful. I liked another one much more--I think it was called French or Foe?..."
3,If you don't have time enough.,"A big part of this book is like a copy of ""French or Foe?"" by Polly Platt. The author mentions the book way too often. At least it gives more advices on making friends when in France. It also talks a bit more on food. I wrote a review on that book as well, so most of that review applies here as well.For this particular book I have one correction, the French do care about the whole world. They don't narrow their attention to USA like most of the world does. For example, 4 out the 7 or 8 French people I have contact with knew Spanish, and 3 of them knew very well.A recommendable book for hurried people already heading to France. You won't waste your 9 or so hours flight."
2,"weary of ""french culture"" books.","while this book does have a lot of information, i'm not sure how much of it is true. i'm concerned with the errors that i found throughout, particularly the ""useful words and phrases"" that closes the book. for the record, the french ""comment"" is mostly used as ""what"" and not ""how,"" ""qui"" certainly does not mean ""why"" but ""who,"" and ""pourquoi"" is not ""who"" but ""why."" as a book written (i assume) for people without a lot of prior knowledge about france and/or the french language, these are huge errors that call into question the validity and accuracy of the rest of the book. i found that too often the author focuses on paris, which misleadingly implies that the entire country is like the major city. i was also not impressed with the general tone of the book, which was condescending and full of typical french stereotypes."
1,Completely impractical,"As a teacher of French, I picked up this book recently because I thought it might provide some cultural insights or funny annecdotes for my students, many of whom go on to study in France. Not only is the book blatantly wrong about the way many things are done in that country, it is also completely useless for someone who bought it in hopes of picking up a few cultural notes before a trip to France. The book is essentially a poor man's psychoanalysis of French behavior (a very faulty one at that) and offers few, if any, concrete suggestions for travelers. Any good guidebook (Frommer's, Rick Steves', Fodor's) would provide more cultural insights and useful suggestions on how to avoid culture shock/ clash."
3,Good book,"I was glad to read this book and Sally Adamson Taylor was pretty good at describing the French and, to sum it up, if you are rude to the French they'll be rude right back! It cuts through the stupid stereotypes such as Jerry Lewis, (no French person I know care about him and I know a lot of French! )and lots of Americans seem to always gear for battles before going to France thinking they are going to be spit in the face as soon as they get out of the airport! Don't worry. This book shows you that the French are not that bad after all! But it will let you know how to ""act"" in stores (just say hello) and all the little things that make a stay much more enjoyable."
5,aftershave brut,"knowing this product from the states, i ordered with amazon, and i found back the original flavour; everything ok; will buy again!"
2,Four Last Songs,I was present at the concert and was looking forward to hearing Voight's rendition of the Four Last Songs. I found it dry and un-moving. I much prefer Rene Flemings recorded rendition.
5,Under Armor Cold Gear,The shipping was prompt and the product is exactly what I wanted. It is good quality and will keep me warm all winter long!
4,Great shirt,Very comfortable and great for cold weather. It keeps the sweat away from your body which is awesome.
3,There are better logic books than this one.,"David Kelley is best known for his advocacy of ""objectivism,"" a misnomer for the thought of Ayn Rand. He is not particularly well known for his work as a logician or philosopher. In my opinion, this book is clear proof why."
4,Funny Enough,"I thought this offering from Chris Rock was pretty good, i agree with the last reviewer that Bring The Pain was a more hard hitting piece of stand up, but this has it's moments also. Besides this is available on DVD and Bring The Pain isn't, to sum things up this will have you laughing and thats what your buying it for."
5,"Funny, flat out funny","I love this DVD!! I missed the HBO showing while I was overseas, but was quite happy that I could get it on DVD. I have lost count of how many times I have watched this.This is Chris Rock at some of his best. Outstanding stand-up."
2,boring,"what a load of crap,maybe it would be better without the retards in the crowd whooping and hollering at everything he said,some of the stuff is funny but all it does is make you smile not laugh."
2,rock job,"i love chris,but why should i laugh when the crowd isnt laughing the jokes are slow paced and just die out.better luck in the next album"
1,Poor,"Sorry, I usually appreciate your comedy, but not this time. You crossed the line with the polio -- our best friend died recently from post-polio conditions. Little is known these days, as you profess, of the disease. Little is known of post-polio and its affects. They are as harmful and degenerating as polio itself. To poke fun is an insult to those who suffered the disease and you have no idea of the after-affects of post-polio."
1,Couldn't have crossed more lines if he tried,"Usually I like controversial artists. But after viewing Chris Rock: Bigger and Blacker (as well as other movies he has ""acted"" in and skits on Saturday Night Live), I feel it inappropriate to call Chris Rock an ""artist"". I would classify him as a ""wannabe"". Chris wants to be funny. Jokes about how the Jerry Lewis telethon is a scam are supposed to be humorous. Telling Jerry to ""make a cripple puppet out of them or somethin'"" is the Chris Rock version of comedy. Suggesting that Robitussin is the cure for child sexual abuse is not really all that clever, it's downright ignorant. In this special, following the pattern of his other ""comic"" appearances, Chris Rock presents himself as the epitamy of arrogance, a man who believes that comedy is built primarily around profanity and not intelligent satirical ideas."
5,Hilarious!,Everybody needs to see this! It's so damn funny I can't even put it into words! Just see it and you will NOT be disappointed!
5,Great DVD,"I bought this dvd used for only $6. I knew it would be awesome, If you like Chris Rock and or Stand up comedy then this dvd is for you. I would also suggest Dave Chappelle as another great stand up comedian."
3,Chris Rock - Bigger and Blacker DVD,I recieved the DVD in a timely fashion and it was in perfect working condition.
3,"Funny Hee Hee, not funny, Ha Ha","This is a strong HBO special, full of hilarious bits of satirical comedy, but I didn't feel it was nearly as strong as his earlier stuff. I watched ""Bring the Pain"" repeatedly-- I belly laughed every time. I made my friends watch it. We'd recite the best bits over and over. With bigger and blacker, there weren't moments to be taken away. Sure, it was funny but not resoundingly so. While I would not argue that C-Rock is this generation's Pryor, this is not his Mudbone."
3,A few gems,"This book has a fine cover, a promising title but little more. I have no idea what he is talking about half the time. Could it be perhaps that Mr Peppermans strength in teaching can only be appreciated in real life? For me the points are not coming accross clearly enough in printed form, I find myself more and more confused as the book goes on. A few gems can be found, it's just a shame that you have to read the entire book to find them. Nope, I'll stick to Edward Dmytryks book 'On Film Editing' thanks..."
2,did anyone edit this?,"There are a few great concepts that Pepperman barely manages to get across but for the most part this Ivy League educated reader was lost. Pepperman uses scenes from films not just as examples, but as the jumping off point for his theories. Yet he doesn't give enough detail that if you haven't seen a scene you can still follow what he's saying (his chicken scratch drawings do little to help). Rather, he provides you every page with a ""hint!"" or a ""tip!"" or if you're lucky a ""hint & tip,"" such as ""ask a lot of questions!"" or ""a study in asymmetrical beats."" (Seriously, I pulled those two at random and they mean little more in context than out). I began to ignore these diversions but holy god, did anyone edit this book?"
5,How to tell a great story,"This book is truely a rare find. I was looking for a book on editing that would explain how to visually communicate a great story through editing, a book that would tell me more than just the history of editing or the techniques of operating the Avid or Final Cut Pro. The Eye is Quicker thoroughly goes through the rationale, the reasons why you make or don't make a cut. Using several examples from films. But more importantly this book provides you with the knowledge how to enhance the story, or how to transfer the dailies into a story. The beauty of editing is that one is essentially providing the last rewrite of the script and the beauty of The Eye is Quicker is that it gives you the fundamentals how to enhance(edit) the story(movie)."
4,"A true showpiece of loyality, brotherhood and finding love.","One of the best movies I've seen that depicts the brotherhood of the biker culture. This movie contains it all: helping friends, dealing with your past, finding your future, saving the Earth and having one hell of a time doing it in style, on a Harley and with your Bro. Some good laughs and action. This movie may be called a ""B"" movie with some first timers to the screen but it gives a true view of the brotherhood of being a biker. Adult language and mild nudity. Must see for the biker at heart!"
5,Coming Soon on DVD! Great Movie!,I am personally working on the encoding of this movie to DVD and know the producers. It will be coming out soon. I do not have an exact date but they are planning some Charity Runs to coincide with an early release!
5,I would only replace it with another,"This is my 3d hedge trimmer in 25 years, and I would never buy anything but this again. Easy to start, never dies upon idle, cuts through nearly everything, light weight, can operate in any direction. FANTASTIC. One flaw though, the handle is attached by a thin cast aluminum flange. do not drop!"
5,Great product at a great price!,This hedge trimmer is way better than my weedeater one. Cuts clean and doesn't wear me out. Great product and the price was way lower than Lowe's.
4,Poulan Hedge Trimmer,Order was promptly received and in advertised condition. The performance of this Poulan Hedge trimmer is as advertised and in excellent working order.
1,worked for an hour,"It started easily out of the box but after an hour the blades stopped moving. Then it wouldn't start and when it would start, the trigger was jammed and it would run madly at full speed ( with the blades not moving) until I shut it off. It's Chinese junk: don't buy one."
1,"DO NOT BUY, NOT RETURNABLE","trimmer didn't work on arrival, looked used/refurbished, and is NOT eligible foramazon return. it's nearly impossible to reach an actual person at poulan and onceyou do, they is no way you can manage a return. instead, you need to hoofit to an authorized dealer and whenever they get to it, they decide if it's fixable or needsreplacement. i paid for overnite shipping for a reason, which is not for the trimmerto sit at a dealer's. it pretty much seems that they will not allow for a return forrefund only exchange and repair. since i needed a trimmer i ended up doing what ishould have done in the first place and bought a stihl trimmer while awaiting the outcomeof this ill-faited and costly endeavor. unless you got faith in poulan, don't mind havingno recourse at all, and enjoy automated phone trees, i suggest you stick with a reputablebrand or at least a product eligible for amazon return."
4,Excellent trimmer,"I've only used it twice so far but for almost an hour each time. I went from a cheap electric hedge trimmer to this and I'll never go back. No more cut cords, no more yanking the cord around and no more of the weak electric trimmer barely being able go cut my bushes. I was trimming sapling trees and branches down with this thing. I'd give it 5 stars but I've only used it twice so far. I will have to balk up my skinny arms though because it does get quite heavy after awhile."
4,It's a jungle out there,"I live in east TN and it is a jungle out there, so this unit will get lots of hard use. This is the first time I've owned a gas powered hedger, I've always owned electric types and I've only had this hedger for three weeks and used it three times. It does seem like a good product. It does have quite a bit of vibration, and is pretty heavy, but it does have a 22"" bar and a hefty engine, so maybe that is normal for these gas powered hedgers. I was very surprised of how stingy it is on fuel, so that's a plus. So far I'm satisfied, we'll see how it holds up to the jungle.B"
3,Refurbished Product Not As Described,"Purchased this as a refurbished hedge trimmer from The Manufacturer's Outlet who also does business as Lawn Station on eBay. No mention by seller that item did not come with the accessories that are supplied when new, such as the blade guard (important) and 2-cycle oil. Unit was very noisy when started, turns out there was insufficient grease in the gears that control the blade movement; had to remove grease cover and add grease which solved the problem. Seems to be a decent product but vendor should have been more honest about description; when I called them they said they knew that the refurb units did not have accessories yet chose not to mention this in the description. They were to order the blade guard; it was to arrive in 2-3 weeks; has been 4 weeks and I've still not seen it."
2,problems,"This trimmer is difficult to start and keep running,,(probably the carb set to current emissions stds)After one hour of use the blade cutting surface are damaged and dented. I will update this when i contact the mfg. It does not have stainless steel blades."
4,HP 2250....not the workhorse I wanted but.....,"I had used an HP IIP for at least five years and was finally to a point of each repair was at least a hundred dollars. The HP IIP is the same as you might see ""Jessica Fletcher"" use on ""Murder She Wrote"" at the beginning of the program. That was a great laser printer, a workhorse. When I decided to take the leap and purchase another, I asked the salesman for a color inkjet printer that would be yet another workhorse. The HP 2250 appears cheaper than the HP IIP, but it produces a quality copy. I find the speed to be adequate, but the only drawbacks I have concerning the printer is the cost of replacement cartridges and the unit is somewhat noisy and actually vibrates the maple table where it sits. I still would recommend this inkjet, although, if you don't need a color printer, I would opt for a less costly laser printer instead. The only advantage for me is the color copy capabilities."
1,"Good sauce, bad price.","Tapatio is one of my favorite go-to hot sauces, but this price is um... not good. Almost 4x what I normally pay. Wow."
4,Excellent,The only reason this is not getting 5 stars is because the product had no expiration date anywhere on it.
5,California style,"With over 30 years of eating hot sauces, this is by far the best tasting on the market. It adds flavor to any item and the heat that those who like hot sauce crave. It doesn't have that vinegar taste like most other brands. Great tasting and warm."
2,Do not buy this book!,"The book is very elementry. It was used and very cheap. The condition of the book was excellent.It may be a good book for a middle school student. That said here is what I would do if looking for a math resource for a child.1: ""Mathematics in Human Affairs"" by Kokomoor for $18.00 from Amazon(used price.).At this point I'll give an example -Under Triangles-The prentice Hill book has 3 pages relevent to triangles one page has a large picture of a Unitarian Church.The kokomoor book lists the 4 sets of conditions that will fix the triangle. The law of sines, the lawof cosines, and the law of tangents and shows how they are derived. It has 35 pages related to triangles with many solved problems2: Go to Dr. Math on the web. They give free homework help as well as many solved problems in many different areas at different grade levels."
1,Uhm...,"This cd really...really sucks. I hate 80's shred metal...and that's basically what this is. It's not the fun keyboard stuff you'll hear from Atom and His Package (www.atomandhispackage.com) or Ozma (www.ozmaonline.com). It's absolute crap. If you buy this cd, you better like bands like poison, ratt, wasp, white snake, damn yankees, motley crue, or basically any other band that sucks. 80's metal solos suck with their cheesey harmonies and two hand tapping. pfft.I say leave this album alone. Don't encourage this guy...he'll only break your heart...and your ear drums."
1,"This is just the kind of rehashed, obscuring HOKUM you should avoid!","This book is a waste of time. It's interpretations of the symbols of the Tarot are largely unfounded and/or intuitive lunging. As for its treatment on the Tarot's history, this author has apparently thrown her arms up in the ""we'll never know"" hokum-dance all too often encountered.So I can slam it, but can I recommend a better source? Sure. Try ""The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination"" instead, for instance. Or even a moderate degree of personal, serious, research.You would do better than to accept the speculative retardation presented in books like this. Please. Seriously. This books deserves ZERO stars."
4,"A thoughtful, easy to read guide to the cards","This is a good book for novices to the Tarot. The author is very clear in explaining the cards, their history, and their uses. I would rank it close to Tarot Plain and Simple by Anthony Louis, which is my favorite book on the Tarot."
5,Excellent book!,I am a beginner tarot card reader and have purchased a few books on reading the cards. This book is excellent for beginners! It takes the Fool through a journey of the cards to help you to learn them in their order. A history relating to Greek mythology is given for the major cards. Every card is described in great detail. At the end of each description there is a explanation of what this card would mean in a reading. There are also some sample spreads at the end of the book which is great. This book is excellent for beginners especially if they would like some background on the tarot. I highly recommend it!
1,False advertising,"I've been to Ukraine and it's hard to find a fat woman under 35, yet this video showcases a chubby woman, exact opposite of what you think of regarding Ukrainian women. Every model was below average, there are only 3 of them, not 13 as falsely implied, don't waste your money on this piece of crap."
1,"Don't buy, Don't rent, Don't see","I purchased this movie as part of a ""package deal"". I sent it back to Amazon and received about half the purchase price back. I consider myself lucky! This is a very poorly made movie that has no value or purpose. Basically, buyers are paying for the producer's trip to other countries. These are not the models that one would expect based on the title I'm certain that they must be nice people, but I wouldn't consider them to be models. Buy a Play Boy dvd instead. You'll be much more satisfied. If you are an ammature photographer seeking professional tips on how to take better photos, you won't get them from this dvd."
2,in response to previous review,"In response to the other review, i have to agree...it isnt so much a book than a collected overview of images, mostly in black and white....this book is mainly a reference book, a catalog of icons....which is fine for what it is. The reason the imagery is in most cases poor quality, is because i believe the author obtained the public access images from the Library of Congress. The book is what it is...its a simple reference guide....it is very concise though...most of the trademarks are very obscure and little known....Other books that may satiate your needs, ""What a Character!"" is a more visual and informative showcase, mainly of collectibles, as well as the upcoming ""Mascotography"", which showcases the history of all the greats in an encyclopedic format...."
3,"So so, to be honest...","...sure, it's better than having nothing, but some great advertisement characters are missing: the ESSO tiger, the Scott's Emulsion fisherman, the Frito Bandito... you name it.Instead, you get a truckload of characters you've never seen or heard of ...and with good reason!"
3,It's not an original Battery from metz,"I got one and now I am re ordering it from Amazon for Back up battery. It works well enough, but not quite sure that will last longer than the original battery. The life for it self I doubt it. Because this is not an original."
4,Is anything not made in China?,It's just a battery but if you were expecting a German product as shown in the photo you may be disappointed. I haven't put it to hard use yet but if it really is made for or by Metz I expect it to work.
2,Tried and returned: fishtank sound,"Yes, this unit it comfortable. It stays in the ear well and is extremely light. However, the sound is TERRIBLE. I was disappointed the minute I tried my first call. The other side sounded like they were in a tin can (hollow echo), and she said I sounded like I was in a fish tank (I was in my car with the windows rolled up). On the same call with the same connection to the same person, I switched it out for a Jabra over-the-ear style and ""Wow what a difference!"" (her words). I'm returning it immediately."
1,Works for about a Month.,I purchase two sets of Body Glove's Earglove Sport ear buds at a local retailer and in both cases they worked great for about 1 month. The connection between the wire and the 2.5mm jack is the weak point.
2,"Work great, but breaks fast","This has always been my favorite hands-free set, but I have got through so many of them that I have finally given up on them. They break so quickly and easily that it just isn't worth it. I love many of the features of this model and it works well, but they break and that just won't do . . . ."
1,No way,"Does not stay in or on my ear! The ear bud has a thick cord and it's impossible to orient it properly so it doesn't stay in the ear. The over the ear piece is too thick with my glasses and doesn't hold the ear. So, it slips off my ear easily. I will say that the sound quality is very good and there have been no complaints about the microphone. However, I can't recommend it for people on the go."
1,One Month Earpiece,"If you only need an earpiece for a month, this product is for you! It's almost as if it was designed to fall apart after 4 weeks...Also, the earplug part would never stay in my ear for the whole conversation."
3,It's ok for what it's worth...,"I use earpieces a lot and this one seems to be the best one I have had for what is worth. It's comfortable, it stays in my ear, and I could hear just fine and vise versa. This earpiece did not give me any problems with my LG PM225 phone and the volume is great! The only complaint I have is that it stops working within a month or two month period. The other person can't hear me but I could hear them. The only reason I kept getting this earpiece was that Sprint would give me a free replacement and this earpiece seemed to be the most pratical one they had. If your cellphone provider does not give out free replacements I wouldn't recommend it..."
1,"worthless, dont get them","They will last about 1 month and then the earbuds will lose connection in the wire. In the end the earbuds won't work at all. I thought my first one was defective, but the second one did the same thing. If you only want a product to use for 1 month, by all means get this product."
1,Body Glove Ear Bud,"I purchased this at Target less than a week ago for $12.99. I shall be returning it to the store as I am most disappointed with it. Even with my 'phone volume down to the lowest, the volume through the earset is way too high and tinny sounding with a slight echo. Then I found the on/off button will not work. Kind of defeats the purpose of getting this to use in the car if you have to look down to end a call."
1,Body Glove Headset,"I didn't like the head set. It DID fit well and didn't fall out of my ear but it distorted my voice for the listener, producing a loud echo. Also it wasn't possible to dial while the head phone was plugged in. If I wanted to call someone, I had to unplug the head phone, dial, then plug it in. Also couldn't end the call by pushing the ""hang up"" buttton. Would have to unplug then push the button. Just inconvenient with poor sound quality."
2,UPDATE: One of the best sounding headsets that I have used but shoddily made!,"Finding a cell phone headset has been a maddening experience for me. I have very small ear openings, so finding a headset with earbuds had been impossible until I lucked up on the BodyGlove Earglove pro. Not only do they fit well, but the sound is excellent! The only problem that I have had is lately is that I have been hearing static. There is a one year warranty on the headset which I will be taking advantage of. The static is the only reason that I can't give the item a 5 star rating. However, I may buy extras just because I like it so.UPDATE:I have to downgrade this rating to 2 stars. The sound quality is wonderful when the unit works. However, it is so poorly constructed that the unit lasts several months and then it is full of static. I have replaced the unit four times. Thank goodness I have a new cell phone and no longer will be frustated with a headset that has so much potential, but is poorly wired."
2,Great while they work,"These would get four stars if I hadn't gone through two of them in a short period of time. Fellowes (the company who makes the product)replaced the first one, no questions asked, without me needing to send back the broken set. But when the second one broke (the wires break and the sound is gone) I decided to ditch the headset completely. But the sound was good while they lasted."
4,Alef Bet is a great book,"I was surprised at how easy it was to learn the alef bet. This book is excellent! It teaches each letter and the vowel points phonectically. I think this book would be great for any adult wishing to learn the very basics of hebrew. Although I'm sure it would be a great book for children in elementary school also. The only problem I had with the book is that it introduces many words with letters that it hasn't taught you yet. Which makes reading those words difficult. Overall, I highly recommend this book. I plan to buy the next book in the series, Olam Gadol. So it must be a good book! :)"
1,Completely useless,"It simply doesn't work! You will get a lot of noise, it's almost impossible to identify what song you are listening! Don't buy this thing..."
2,Not That Great,"I was expecting something a little better. I wanted to get a good one for my creative Zen Micro, as as we Zen users know its hard to find good products for us. The quality was not good, and very staticy. I bought it and it cost 50, and immedaitly returned it. Hpfully something will come around in the future. My guess is to hold off for a dramatic price drop."
3,Disappointed!,"While the unit works well when it works, I have been having problems with it in that it somehow looses a signal and powers off. This problem seems to be connected to the power cord as working with just batteries doesn't create the problem. Even with fresh batteries and then using the power cord results in this problem. I drive 80 miles a day to work and back, unfortunately the AAA batteries don't last very long."
4,Nice device.,"Very nice device, works well, although the one minute shutoff feature is a little annoying, it can be worked around. Worth the money."
1,this is a piece of junk,"I've owned several of these FM transmitters and this one is by far the worst. First time I used it, its signal was just too weak. Then I couldn't turn it off and had to take the batteries out! When I went to use it a second time it never worked. Unfortunately I threw away the packaging and can't send it back. Horrible product, buy anything else!"
2,Very disappointed - Expected better quality from Belkin,"I've used similar products to this before, so I'm familiar with the way this should work and what kind of quality you can expect in the music quality. I'm sorry to say that this Belkin transmitter just doesn't match up to other products. I tried using this with a nice JVC radio and only got static when the device was less than a foot away. I then tried it in a car and got a faint signal covered mostly by static.Like my title states, I expected better from Belkin. The concept is good, the features are great, but the implementation lacks something very important: quality."
2,Poor product - Not fit for its purpose.,"Disappointing product from Belkin!! Transmitter was weak and very directional, both with batteries and with power supply.Hiss was unacceptable, and when I walked around room / turned around, the interference became worse. I have tried another FM transmitter made by a different company, and the results were much better.Mine was returned within a few days for a refund."
1,Dissapointed,Why put the ability to tune to any FM station into a product that cannot transmit a clear signal to an antenna mounted on the front fender of an SUV?
1,I don't recommend this item at all.....i'm dissapointed!!,"I'm pretty dissapointed, it doesn't work at all, it is almost imposible to tune the device, i have tried in both home & car audio systems, and the experience is awful....terrible sound!"
4,Not good in the car.,"I have bought several FM transmitters, each time hoping that the newest one will be better with newer and more advanced technology. Nothing really beats a wired connection like a separate input jack or a cassette adapter. Perhaps it has something to do with the FCC limitation for the strength of output signal. Lots of static and intermittent reception. There are also a lot of interference while driving your car particularly in cities as opposed to driving in a more rural location.There is no problem if you will use it only inside the house or not going mobile. You can choose one perfect spot and leave it there and you get a clean reception.Pros:Good reception in the houseDigital ReadoutPortability. Wire wraps to itself.Cons:Get a wired connection if you drive a car."
1,"Poor range, needs to go outside of 88.1 FM","I'm returning this device, which I wanted to use to broadcast audio from my TV over FM.Unfortunately, you can only tune it to 88.1 - 107.9 -- it would be more useful if it went outside that range (where there aren't any FM radio stations), especially in the 87's.The critical limitation is the range. The range in the product description is 30 ft. I got about 5 feet, and that was with static. I only got a relatively clear signal at about 6 inches. I tried a number of stations.Very disappointing."
3,"Awesome Product, But....",This is an awesome product as it works great as long as you can install a wire antenna which requires opening the unit and soldering. Otherwise the effective working distance is far shorter than advertised. The auto on/off feature is certainly a plus and there are many frequencies to choose from.
4,Belkin transmitter,"I found it to be good, radio frequency can often be poor until you find a weak radio station to transmit to. I don't like the auto on and off, sometimes slow to turn on. Overall, I think these transmitters are helpful to use in certain situations and this one seems to work well enough."
2,could work better,"Not as clear a signal as I had hoped for. Have to be patient and move unit and MP3 around until you find sweet spot. I found dashboard, immeduately above radio best. Still have to get lucky w/ channel you choose even in rural areas. Unit that slips into cassette deck provides cleaner signal."
3,Average,"What can i say, it works but not the way it should, the transmitter could be stronger the signal isn't so strong so it makes a bit of interference sometimes, i live in a big city so i was hours looking for the best station so it didnt have interference, this could been avoided if it has stronger signal.Other issue is that the output volume is a bit low i normally set my mp3 player volume to max or if not i'll hear the noise radio makes when u crank up the volume, like a buzz."
3,disappointed,disappointed at how often you have to change the frequency when travelling and the short life of the batteries. still gets the job done but only if you're patient.
4,Worth the buy!,"I really love this device. It allows me to use my MP3 player on any radio as long as I am able to find the right radio station. The only problem that I have found with it is that in my car, I am not able to get a clear sound as I am on a stereo set. I believe this happens because I am not able to put the transmitter close enough to my antenna, which is in the back of my car, not the front. Overall, it is worth the buy!!"
3,Cheap and it works (sometimes).,"I guess I am a little picky when it comes to sound quality. I have a line in on my car stereo and my mp3 player sounds great. My wife's car doesn't have a line in so I need to use a FM transmitter to get sound to the stereo but didn't want to spend much too much. Well I didn't expect too much from this transmitter and I'm glad I didn't because I would have been disappointed. It does transmit but it doesn't sound great and suffers from interference often (I don't live in a big city I wouldn't even bother with this if I did). I did add a longer line in cable, 6 feet, and that seems to help some since it basically increased the size of the antenna. But my wife isn't picky about sound quality so this is fine for her, you get what you pay for!"
2,bad signal,"I'm i little disappointed. I use it in my car mainly, and the signal is very weak. And it was so hard to find a frequency free, maybe it has to do with it.One good think, is easy to use."
1,Weak transmitter,"Just returned mine to amazon. The transmitter is so weak that you literally have to have the device touching your antenna if you want no static. Putting it within a couple feet will get you sound but it will be riddled with static. Anything further than 3 feet and your pretty much SOL. This is a far cry from the transmitters built into something like a Sirius or XM tuner. Using batteries or the 12v adapter makes no difference, it's still utterly useless. I would definitely not recommend this product."
3,Not great,"I got this as a gift to use with my Dell DJ. The batteries never lasted so I tried to get a car adaptor plug for it. The guy at RadioShak said the thing was set up funny and the plug was not big enough for its capacity, so pretty much forget finding one. I agree with everyone else's comments regarding static and constantly having to change the station as well, but thought that was just what you had to deal with in all transmitters. It might be worthwhile paying a little more for one- maybe the quality is better."
2,It was nice while it lasted...,I enjoyed being able to listen to my MP3 player until the transmitter died the 2nd month I had it.I'm not sure if I will invest in another one any time soon.
2,Alien noises,"I am highly disappointed with the transmitter. I expected the sound to be of similar quality as the CD changer in my trunk that also uses a transmitter to play through a radio station. The TuneCast II, however, was of much worse quality. Distortion abounds. Alien noises are heard especially when music is fading in or out. Also, static is really a problem. I expect that the transmitter should give a clear signal to my car stereo when in the car; that's certainly within the 10' radius. Reception was even worse when using the batteries instead of the D/C adapter.On a positive note, the transmitter does allow a broad range of stations to be used."
2,"Good idea, but didn't work well",The basic layout and listed features of the product are good but I couldn't get it to work without excessive static. I tried it in two cars on several different frequencies and in several different locations in each car. It also picked up a whining sound that varied with the engine speed. Finally returned the product.
1,THIS THING SUCKS!,"This product is absolutely terrible. I've tried it in every state from SC to WI and never got it to transmit a clear signal. It's weak. If you enjoy static its the right choice, but if not dont buy it."
1,Not very useful,I purchased one of these and it had a range of maybe 6' if it was held up and turned just right. I took it back and exchanged it thinking that it may have been a defective one but the second one was just as bad. It worked in my car only when I held it in just the right position. Just not good.
3,Bad in city; good on the highway,"The reviews condemning this product are pretty accurate. In the city, this thing barely works, if at all. However, outside of the city, it worked great, with almost no static.If you travel over the road frequently, the Belkin TuneCast may come in handy, but if you rarely leave your city, find something else."
2,cheap but crappy,"very weak transmission power, the sound is opaque and now it doesn't work with the power adapter, i want my money back!"
2,Belkin FM Transmitter,This product is adaquete. it uses up batteries quickly. It would be great if there was a electric power coord for it. Use in the car is good!
2,Dosen't work!,"If I hold it in my left hand in the exact center of the steering wheel it will work sometimes. Placed 4"" from the antenna it dosen't work. Batteries last, maybe 4 hrs.Too bad I like Belkin stuff on the whole."
2,not as good as manufacturer claims,"This item does transmit through automobile radio, but it is not easy to find a radio frequency that does not experience bleed-over from nearby frequencies, probably due to low output wattage from the Belkin FM Transmitter. Consequently, there is a lot of noise and static and it is somewhat annoying. When travelling, it is necessary to re-tune to different frequencies sometimes every 5-10 miles due to bleed-over. It is not much better in a stationary situation, either. I would not purchase this again.I wish I would have had the opportunity to test it prior to buying. A cassette adapter is much cleaner sound."
2,Don't waste time or money,"This thing produces a clean (and therefore, acceptable) sound only within 1 foot of the stereo. But the most important drawback, apparently unnoticed by many, is that it plays MONO! Even though on my stereo's display it says ""stereo"", the sound is mono. Just plug in a set of headphones into your stereo while using this transmitter, and you'll know what I'm talking about. For music, this thing is useless, and I'm taking it back."
3,Ho Hum ... All FM transmitters stink,"OK...so I keep banging my head on a wall with this technology. Getting your iPod to work in your car should be simpler. WAIT! It is! Just not using FM transmitters to do so. A cassette unit is much better but if you don't have that, there are alternatives such as CD Changer Emulators that replace your CD changer with the iPod (this is good, trust me) I did this and I love it.I do not love FM transmitters. They *NEVER EVER* work folks. I used this one cross country and it was a 30-40% success. So that was a lot of frustration and static for many hours. GRRR...Save your money. The unit wasn't bad and it functioned like it should have but overall this technology should be dead by now. Gimme a break!"
2,Disappointing,Rather poor quality sound; less then a regular FM station. I'm kind of surprised it was brought to market at this quality level. I'm taking it back. PS It is kind of clever .. powers up when audio signal is rec'd.
1,Not worth the money,Terrible transmitter. Very weak signal even when placed right next to radio. Signal is a little better with dc power but still weak. Extremely unsatisfied with product
2,Worked poorly for two weeks and then died!,"This item worked for about two weeks. It transmitted pretty well at a range of about 6 feet, but not very well at greater distances. After two weeks, the product died and never worked again. I'd recommend going with a different transmitter."
1,Useless,"Concur with the bad reviews. Sound quality was extremely poor, equivalent to a badly tuned FM station. Had to take it back, and exchange for a cassette adaptor (which works fine)."
1,worst ever,I purchased this item because my brother has one - same brand- earlier version - very good unit - the unit that I received has a very limited range - less than 10 feet - totally unacceptableJimB
1,Awful sound and strange device behavior,"First I had trouble setting my own FM frequency: the device refused to do it, and it was not intuitive how to achieve it. When I finally succeded, the quality of transmission was awful. This device is very underpowred, in turms of transmission power. I had to return it to the seller. I recommend to avoid this device, try looking for something more mature."
1,Not A fan!!!!,Not really a fan of this item. Volume was very low. Didn't lock into channels very good without static. Just not a good product in all.
1,don't buy this,"""broadcast"" quality is real bad (lots of static)range is REAL bad (you have to put it right next to your antenna!)worst part however is that you will have to change frequency every few miles or so... as soon as another station comes in range of the frequency you're on the fun is over and you will have to go look for another frequency on both the transmitter and the radio.. All this messing around is plain dangerous while on the road!Do not buy this, it just does not work."
1,POS - Not at all satisfactory,"Tried everything to make this little ""gem"" work... Finally admitted defeat.* Unacceptable weak signal* Lots of static* Great in theory - sucks in realityAgree with other poor reviews - cord is too short, even with ""extra"" antenna - poor reception, not acceptable for music or audio books."
2,Quick and dirty,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but no FM transmitter will provide the kind of sound quality you get from a gizmo that goes in the casette player. That said, if you want to play your iPod (or anything with a line-level signal and a 1/8"" plug) in the car or on a friend's stereo, the TuneCast will do it. But between songs or when you turn the volume up above dinner-music level (unless I'm doing something wrong), you'll hear the hiss and buzz that I got on every frequency I tried, even when I placed the transmitter right up against the FM antenna of the intended receiver.I'm back to the cassette deck gizmo. Thank goodness I didn't throw it away when my portable CD player died."
2,"Poor reception, worse battery life","I bought this item with moderate expectations. I know the sound quality will not be the best from a device like this, but I did expect it to work. In 2 of the 3 cars I tried it in the reception was poor unless it was held in a specific position. In the other car it could be placed in the glove box and worked with no issues. I should mention that all of these vehicles had rear mounted antennas.The battery life was also dismal- I used it for a couple hours in the car that it did work in, and put it away for a couple weeks. I attempted to use it and the batteries were on their last legs. I will get another FM broadcaster, but another brand and one that can be plugged into the vehicle for power.I expected more performance and battery life for the price, and returned it."
2,Fine promise ... not lived up to,I bought this little gizmo in the vain hope that it would do what it says in the description.It works - reasonably well - if you are at home and not movinga tt all - but frankly I don't need it there.It doesn't work well once you are in the car. It works best if I hold it up in the air between the front seats - hardly practical if I am driving!Unfortunately it didn't live up to it's promise.
2,There are much better options for a little more money,"I bought the Belkin TuneCaster a year ago. It worked fine but died after less than 80 hours of use. Something went wonky and it couldn't recognize that the iPod was sending a signal--it would shut off after 60 seconds--so frustrating and not fixable. Now, here's the confessional part: despite all the awful reviews, and my previous bad experience, I succumbed and bought another Belkin a couple months ago. My deranged thinking was, 'It's a great price and I really miss hearing my iPod in the car. After all this time, they're bound to have worked out the glitch, right?' WRONG. The new Belkin worked fine for about 40 hours of play this time and then fried out in the exact same way. Do yourself a favor, get a Monster Cable iCarPlay. It's twenty bucks more but it broadcasts a really nice sound and after 40 hours, it's still going strong."
3,Hoping for better,"Positives:1) Battery powered or use power adapter in vehicle2) 4 pre-sets to choose from and you determine the 4 pre-set stationsNegatives:1) Even after carefully selecting the best stations and having 4 pre-sets from which to choose, there is still occasional but regular low level static which is disappointing. I have not tried other options to know if it would be eliminated with another FM transmitted or if something to do with my vehicle creates alot of static.2) The cord from the MP3 player to the tunecast is fairly short so if you pick up the MP3 player to adjust anything, the FM transmitter dangles in the air which seems to place alot of torque on the wire coming out of the player."
2,don't expect hi-fi,"you will get something a bit better than AM radio quality out of this thing. this is the second device of this sort which I purchased, and the first one which is a ""name brand."" The other model I tried only had 4 frequencies, the belkin is a definite improvement in that it has the whole range of FM frequencies available and also the cigarette lighter plug is a nice feature. The other model I tried was battery only. I got it for about a usd JACKSON after a rebate. at that price it's worth keeping as a novelty if nothing more. would love to hear about an option to get something more in the hi-fi area, even the old-school ""fake casette"" deal with a wire would be ok to me - I'm less concerned about wireless and more concerned about sound quality."
1,Disappointing,"Diappointing for several reasons:1. Very finicky. Sound quality changed depending upon these variables: position of the unit relative to the radio/antenna, battery power, volume of the iPod.2. It burns through alkaline batteries.3. The DC cigarette-lighter-adapter did not work!4. All those cords and cables are a huge mess! It would have been much better to get an FM transmitter that attached to the iPod (or MP3 player)."
1,Useless near a city,"I live 20 miles from Boston, and it's impossible to get good, static-free reception from this transmitter, even when the transmitter is mere inches from the radio. There are only a few frequencies that don't have stations on them, and the interference is still too much. Plus, a frequency you thought was free can suddenly become occupied when the weather changes or your position changes slightly. Once, I had a station appear in an ""empty"" frequency just by moving my car three feet, backing out of a parking space. And when I drove through the heart of some cities, this FM transmitter was completely drowned out.I've switched to a cassette adapter. The fidelity is at least as good, and, unlike FM, there's no static at all (ironic smile)."
2,"Pitiful range, bad sound quality","I bought this wanting to play music from my laptop on the car stereo during my commute to school. Even in the car, the sound was fuzzy and the limited range was prohibitive (as in it wouldn't even work from the backseat haha).As far as I can tell, my problems weren't due to interference from other stations. There weren't any radio stations within several megahertz at least from the station I was using (90.3 in Waco, Texas).I also tried it out on my cousin's iPod in Austin and we got the same thing - lots of interference."
2,It's a good idea but...,"I started off with the Belkin Tunecast. Since I live in metropolitan New York, just about every station is used, including the four that are available on the tunecast. I therefore decided to upgrade to the Tunecast II. To my dismay, this was not much better. There is always a constant static behind my music. If you spend time sitting in the car and finding an unused station and adjusting the car and mp3 player volumes you will eventually get a good enough signal. However it is not perfect and although I am not at all happy with the product, I am forced to keep it because my car does not have a tape deck to use a tape converter. Oh well."
3,"good, but....",overall it's a good device and very usefull if it works as supose to work. But the output radio signal is low so you can hear a continuous background noise low or strong and sometimes with different tonalities depending of the device position.
3,takes some fiddling to work,"Got this instead of the IRiver b/c this one is not car-only. I found that broadcasting at higher frequencies work better, but there are sweet spots such as 103MHZ working better than 107MHZ, depending on the environment. At 88MHZ, the range was practically 1', if you take your hand away. Quality-wise, it adds a little static and loses much of the treble (adding SRS effects on my mp3 player was unnoticeable).Bottom line: i'm getting a $99 car stereo upgrade that plays mp3 cds and has a line-in."
2,FM Transmitter not powerfull enough,"Works well, powers up automatically when MP3 starts, but It has to be close to the radio to transmit without noise"
2,There are other fish in the sea,"I bought this transmitter when i bought my iPod because, at the time, it was rated the best. However, I have come to the conclusion that it is not the best buy. Although, this transmitter gets decent range, the sound quality is terrible. The worst thing about it is that the batteries do not last long at all. It has a charger port that draws 12 volts, but it only hold two AAA batteries giving a maximum charge of 3 volts combined, making it vastly underpowered without a charger. Plus it is kind of awkward to handle because of the wire. I just recently purchased an iTrip transmitter and I love it. If you're trying to decide, I would buy the iTrip, it's cheaper and it plugs directly into the top of your iPod drawing on it's batteries."
2,"Worked Great, While it Worked","I got this as a gift about a month ago and I've only used it four or five times and it worked great. The sound wasn't bad and I never had any problems getting it to power up. I haven't touched it in a couple weeks, went to use it today and it won't turn on. I've tried the power cord, the batteries, new batteries. I made sure my iPod was fully charged and I tried a whole range of different stations on two different stereos, nothing.So it worked as good as I expected it to, it just didn't last long. I would not recommend and I will not buy another."
1,Belkin Portable Music TuneCast II FM Transmitter (F8V3080),"Wow! Fast service.......but I still don't know how to work it. Either it is not a good product or I am doing something wrong. I can hear a little bit on my receivers, but even that is terrible. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 3. I went ahead and bought a cable from DFX to directly connect my pc to the stereo receiver and it works great, sounds as if I have actual cd's in the stereo. Just run it under the house and no one knows it is there."
3,Useless in urban areas,"The local FM transmitter is a great idea, but in a typical urban enviroment, it turns out that the radio spectrum is simply too crowded for it to work well. This is true for the Belkin as well as all other similar products that use ""unlicensed"" (i.e. low power) transmission. I bought this product for use on my daily commute, and was disappointed with the performance. It also did not work well at home. However, on a long road trip, in rural areas with few radio stations, it worked fine. The features (battery/car charger included, full spectrum tuning, auto-off) make this unit convenient to use. Caveat emptor."
1,Doesn't Work,"I've wasted over sixty bucks on Belkin in trying to listen to my mini iPod in the car. The TuneCast is great if you enjoy listening to static, and the cassette adaptor is great if you appreciate the value of listening to your music from only the left speakers."
3,Mediocre,"I was not too impressed with this, but without a MP3 jack, there's not much you can do with an old stereo. What I can is it works.1) Quality of sound - As with any FM transmitter, don't expect super high quality, it just doesn't happen. I mean you're basically transmitting radio waves from your MP3 player to your radio, what can you expect?2) Functionality - This is the worse. I have 2 things plugged in, the Belkin to my MP3 player and the Belkin to the cigarette lighter (so I don't have to use batteries). And my car is not spacious. So basically, once you have everything plugged in, you pretty much won't be able to switch albums or anything that requires a lot of looking much.3) FM reception - I can only give it 7/10.Overall, if you absolutely need to listen to your MP3 player and you don't have a jack, this is about the best you can do. Not a great solution, but not much else you can do."
1,Don't bother,This product didn't put out sufficient power at any frequency to listen to anything but static.
2,Belkin Tunecast II,"Well, this was a lesson in shopping before you buy...I found the item cheeper in Target, but wasn't able to cancel the order even though the item hadn't shipped and wouldn't for almost a week, nor had the charged been put through my bank yet.Additionally, when I got the item, the quality wasn't that good and the volume has to be turned up to max to hear your music (the same MP3 sound just fine when used with a plug in tape player adapter without cranking the volume)So all and all I wasn't too happy with this purchase, but hopefully I learned a lesson."
3,It kinds of works; but too easily interferred,"It works as long as the music is played in high volume. However, it still can be interferred quite easily. Upgrading the car radio with one that has a line-in is a better idea than using this device.Jay Chan"
4,City Blues,"Good on long distance travel, but difficult to find a frequency that is not being used because of all the local college stations on the low end of the FM dial in the NYC metro area. Works great outside of city perimeter."
1,"Unusable, unless you don't mind a lot of static","I would like to know how the people giving this little gadget positive reviews were able to get this to function well. I have attempted to use the Belkin with my mp3 player several times in three different cars, and have not been able to get it to produce sound without an unacceptable amount of background static. I will often get some reasonably clear sound for a few minutes, only to be followed by loud, irritating static that often overpowers the sound of the mp3 player. I have not been able to fix it, no matter how many times I change the radio station or adjust the volumes on my radio and mp3 player. Perhaps it is just incompatible with iPods.I'm very disappointed with this product and would not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone."
2,"Works, for a while...","I have a Creative Zen Touch and wanted to be able to listen to it in my car without spending a fortune on a new sterio. The sound isn't CD quality, but that's to be expected, over all still better than nothing at all. The one problem I've had with this device is the poor wiring. Not shortly after a few weeks of use, the wire connecting to my mp3 player seems to have split or ""frey"" internally which causes the left and right speakers to occasionally fade in and out when the wire moves. Secondly, the AC adaper has basically stopped working all together forcing me to use batteries which last only a few hours worth of play.My advice, if you're planning on listening to your mp3 player everyday for the rest of it's life, either spend $100 bucks to have a jack put onto your existing sterio so you can plug the player into it directly, or buy a new system all together for $250+.I loved this device, but now it's just a pain in the ass."
1,I would have given it NO stars if I could!,"It's not like me to complain, but this gadget is absolutely horrible! No matter what station I try, or where I position the unit in a car (I tried several different cars, American and foreign) it still hardly works. I'm lucky if I can get it to play at all, much less be clear. It does nothing but crackle (sometimes very loud) most of the time. I can get the same effect from a box of Rice Krispies for a lot less money! Do yourself a favor, and skip this item. Go for a cassette adapter or some other wired option. You'll save some money, along with your speakers and your ears!"
2,rip off,"I am very disappointed in this Belkin product. I purchased this tuner in January, and it stayed in my car. I never took the device out or handled it very much; thus, it was fairly stationary. By the end of May the wires in it were pulling out of the casing and the tuner stopped working. Belkin doesn't offer a way to replace only the wires."
2,did not work for me,It's a very nice product but it's very difficult to maintain a steady signal perception in big cities. It's probably because of the powerful radio signals. Another problem; while listening if you lost the signal for some reason then you hear a very disturbing noise which can easily scare you. It's good for stationary use (home or office).
3,Expected more...,"I expected more from this device. I couldn't even get FM radio quality. My best local stations sounded better (I used it in my car)If you live in a big Metropolitan area, I don't recommend to buy this transmitter. In my case I couldn't find any frequency above 88,7MHz that was clean enough to get good quality. The spectrum is packed with stations, only the first four frequency slots were available but for some reason I got a lot of noise.Even in those frequencies the quality was very low, so I returned the product.I bought a cassette adapter and the sound is MUCH better than with this transmitter.I will use the cassette until I have money to buy a head unit with auxiliary input."
2,Piece of junk,"Here's the technical dope. Not enough FM deviation. This translates to a very low-volume signal. You have to turn your radio volume up so high that you're getting as much noise as signal. No matter how close you put it to your radio or antenna. Totally unacceptable. Tried a second one before giving up and getting my money back. I gave it two stars because it does work and if you have a very, very low-noise radio you might find it acceptable."
2,Not ready for serious music listening,"1. Battery life is short. 2 AAA batteries lasts about 4 hours only. Definitely need a car adepter. But if you do, you are no longer wireless. Might as well get the connection kit.2. Cord is short. Since the connect slides in and out to easily, moving the ipod or the transmitter usually unplugs the system while driving. Not ideal.3. Reception is okay for audio books, but not for music. Driving in downtown streets usually gets a lot of static noise."
4,"Easy to use, effective, versatile","Small, convenient, and super easy to use. I have hooked it to my computer in the spare room, then played music through my stereo in the living room. I have used it with my PDA and my cell phone. Some stations are clearer than others. You have to tinker with it a little to find what works best for you. It is IMPORTANT to realize that you may need an adaptor to get it to fit the various equipment you may be using it for. I BELIEVE it uses a 3.5mm plug. My cell phone and PDA have 2.5mm jacks, so I was kinda disappointed when I got it in the mail, then had to wait 7 more days for the adapter to arrive before I could test it out. Don't expect it to be amazing and you won't be disappointed. It works well enough. -Rex"
1,It's a piece of crap!,"I bought this FM transmitter for a road trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles to use with my iRiver mp3 player. The FM transmitter only provided acceptable transmission in small sections of Interstate 5 where there are very few FM stations. While in the SF or LA area, the Belkin FM transmitter were broadcasting more *hiss* than music. Stay away from this piece of crap and save yourself some grieve!"
1,Good if you don't care what it sounds like,"This product is sub-par in every possible category you could put it in. I don't know who these people are who rate this product high, or for that matter what type of sound quality they put up with on a regular basis. Put plainly, this product sucks, don't waste your money. There is not only a constant hiss, but the music comes in and out and the music from the radio mingles with it every once and awhile. Oh, and if the device wanders to far from the reciever when you round a curve or something, the reception might go completely out and you will be greeted by the loud shriek of static at whatever volume you had your radio set at. This thing is a better value in a garbage can than in your car."
1,A pile of cheap junk,"Had 2 of these, both were free or just about free. Both broke within a day of first use. Just as well I did not actually buy them!"
1,Too low signal,"I've just used it 4 times: three cars 1 home stereo, just to probe it doesn't work. Don't waste your money."
1,"Batteries run down, cord frazzled","I've had this adapter for about 2 months now... I don't use it all that frequently - primarily for long car trips. On just about each time that I've pulled it out to use it the batteries have been dead. After the first time, I made sure that I turned off the adapter, so I know that it's not from something I did. I also just realized that the wire covering stuff (the stuff that protects you from getting an electrical shock) has pulled away from the unit - exposing the wires. Sooo, I'll be taking this product back for a refund (and getting a wireless one instead) and can absolutely not recommend it to anyone."
1,Poor product,"I just received this product. I tried numerous different frequencies and they all had static and distortion. It was only transmitting about 16'. I realize that this is not a 500.00 FM modulator, but I expected better for the money. A 10.00 adapter works just as well. It -- might -- work in a car a foot or so from the receiver. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,Wasted money,"I'd like to say that this unit is worth the price. I'd like to but I can't.It doesn't perform as advertised. I couldn't get it to work with my home stereo and after fooling with it for almost an hour I gave up.The Monster Cable is a much better buy, not to mention the fact that it gets the job done with much less hassle."
1,Poor reception,"I just hate it when products are being advertise as good as what they say, but except this one. I use my zune with this belkin for my car and i cant barely get frequency and songs stops."
1,"Poor performance, drains batteries","The unit works okay except....It drains batteries. It constantly drains 1 mA even when off. That means a fresh set of alkalines will be 50% drained after a month even if the unit is not used. When on, the current drain increases to 80 mA. The result is generally 4-10 hours on NiMH rechargeables.Range is poor. It is almost impossible to get good reception in my car near a city. Although it claims to cover the entire FM band, my unit did not produce a signal at frequencies above 105.5 MHz. Probably a manufacturing defect.On the plus side, it remembers four frequencies even after batteries are removed."
2,"Cool idea, but the technology's not there yet","I picked up one of these to give it a try in my car. I'll be returning it for a refund.When it's working well, it sounds great. For me, that only happened for seconds at a time, usually while holding the transmitter in my hand trying to remain perfectly still. Most of the time it would have some audible static. Especially driving around/under power lines.I used it in my car in the Los Angeles area. That said, this region is bathed in radio waves. Hardly channel on the dial doesn't have a radio broadcast on it, and you can hear the channels mixed with static on most of the in-between channels. Whether the TuneCast II would work someplace more isolated, I don't know.Someday maybe we'll have a pocket-sized piece of FM transmitting equipment...but I don't think we're there yet."
1,Not worth the money,"I have tried this device numerous times in different cars with NO luck. I can't believe how badly this product worked. I love my iPod, just wish I could find a tuner to use it in my car.What a waste of money"
1,"Terrible sound, nice package",This is the worst FM modulator I have used and owned. Soundsworst than FM radio on the radio.
1,NOT ready for prime-time,"I tried THREE units, and each was DOA in some way, shape or form.The unit is supposed to auto-power on on a source signal. It didn't.The unit is supposed to power-on by pressing the two right-hand buttons simultaneously for 2 seconds. It didn't.The ONLY way I got power at all on any of these units, after swapping batteries, etc., was to plug it into the car adapter. this was fine, but the unit would loose it's settings the moment the car was shut off.If you can get one of these devices to actually function, they do a reasonably good job, though with medeocre quality, and limited range.But, until Belkin can remedy its quality control issues, I would avoid this product like the plague."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this and am not disappointed, because I wasn't expecting a whole lot. It works much better with the power adapter than with batteries."
1,Horrible,"Based on other consumer reviews, I thought this upgraded version of TuneCast would perform well -- but not perfectly -- in my car. It didn't.The device couldn't broadcast my Ipod clearly on any station. The static-filled music came through very weak no matter what I tried.The problem may be that the car antenna is located in the back of my Audi A4. Looks like I'll have to plug my Ipod casette adapter back in when I drive this turkey back to the store."
1,Poor - No reception at all,"1st I had trouble turning it on. I realized you have to have the volume of your MP3 player about middle volume or more. (Or press and hold both buttons for 2 seconds - not obvious.) Then I could not get a signal at all on my home boombox. I only wanted to listen to audio books, but the only way I could hear any music at all was to place the device so that it was touching the attenae, at the very end, and even then it had a lot of static. It had brand new batters from the package too! I'm returning it. I live in NYC."
3,Nice but not so nice,At first I had problem with the item because you have to have single on in order for it to turn on and if you turn it to low it turns off i found this product was nice but was such a hassel to hook up in the car. It never rember the radio station that i had on so many wires in the car. I order another turner that is made for my mp3 player that has everything in one
5,Muy Bueno,"Este producto es fundamental para quienes quieren oir su musica de su mp3 portatil en el automovil. Muy sencillo de usar, inclusive tiene varias memorias para distintas emisoras, por si alguna de las seleccionadas tiene interferencia pues es muy sencillo cambiarse a otra. Ademas sirve para oir la musica no solo en al automovil sino en cualquier radio, en la oficina o en la casa. Simplemente se le ponen un par de pilas AAA y eso es todo, cuadras tu emisora y a disfrutar de la musica"
1,DOA,"Got the thing as a gift, popped in the batteries and..... nothing... It didn't turn on. Went through the manual, replaced the batteries...tried everything I could think of, but alas.......dead...Thanks for ruining Christmas, Belkin."
3,It's OK,"I was really excited to open the box and get this set up. Through a week of use I have found that it consistently gets static, no matter where I put it in my car. Additionally, it's kind of a pain to keep switching stations when you are in a populated metro area that has a lot of radio traffic. The idea in theory is excellent, I wonder if it can be perfected a bit more though."
1,worthless piece of junk,"The directions require that a radio ""needs to be tuned into a weak signal""Problem is I have a digital receiver at home and in my car that only locks on strong signals.Removed the antenna from my car hoping that might be a work around.... still no go.Ended up returning it for a refund.Can not recommend this item at all."
3,Great for the first three months,"I am on my 2nd Belkin transmitter. Two things keep me from giving this product five stars: 1) you go thru a lot of batteries. 2) eventually either the left or right channel go out due to chord integrity. My 2nd one is one its last leg, and to get both left and right channel output I have to flex the chord around and find the ""magic"" spot. Other than these two issues, it is a cheap and handy product."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I have been trying to use this product with my Toshiba Gigabeat F20 MP3 player (like an Ipod photo only cooler). Unfortunately I just couldn't get the thing to come through my radio. The instructions seem clear, and I tried a lot of different frequencies without success.I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"As many others, I was warned, but still decided to give it a try :(The transmission volume is low, the sound quality is poor, and it generates a lot of noise. I got it for listening to pre-recorded talk shows and it couldn't handle even that.To back up my opinion: I listen to Sirius satellite radio via the FM link, and to me that is how the FM transmitter should work.SO DO NOT BY THIS BELKIN PIECE OF JUNK!"
2,FM transmitter,In my area the transmitter picks up too much interference causing sound distortion while listening to music on my car stereo.
2,Unusable in the Suburbs,I thought I couldn't lose with its ability to tune anywhere on the band. But in suburban Chicago there wasn't one frequency with usable reception.
1,no good,its a piece a junk! It barely works and when it does the signal is weak and the music quality is very poor.
1,Simply does not work,"If you live in a large metropolitan area (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area) this device simply will not work. There are just too many FM stations in the area to make this thing work (something they should be telling you in the product description). The sound quality, when it works, is terrible at best.Spend a little more money and buy one of the Sony cassette adapters. They work great."
2,"Don't bother, poor sound!","Short story...My 1st one broke after one month, Belkin sent a new one(I had to give a credit card number and pay for shipping back...no big deal)Easy to use, poor sound. I've tried different MP3 players, FM receivers, batteries, frequencies, settings...no luck. Sounds a little worse that Am radio. More muffled. Good luck!"
2,Fizzled out in less than a year,"When I first bought this, I thought it was great b/c you could use it with batteries outside of the car. However, the product kept fading out, turning off in the car if you touched the wire. Finally, just stopped working altogether. I've only had it for about 9 months."
2,works fine but at low volume,"good: quick to set up: you just plug in the cigarette lighter adapter, and choose a frequency (where the radio is normally quiet), turn on ipod or other source, and you are done. Also great is that is automatically turns on when you plug in a (playing) source. With the cigarette lighter adapter you don't even have to install the included 2xAAA batteries. You can also pick and store more than one frequency in case you are drivng far and start to get interference with a different area's local radio station.not so good: you have to turn up the volume on the ipod to max, and the radio also to almost max ... After a month, I don't use mine anymore, having bought a cable (Nyko Stereo Link for iPod) now to connect the ipod digital audio straight to the aux input on the back of my car stereo head unit."
3,Its okay,"You need to 1st find a radio station that you can use the frequency on, while I can hear my music there is static in the background. It drives my husband bonkers and I just learned to live with it. I haven't taken the time to see if there is any other frequency to use...would I buy it again? In a word NO."
2,"Too much static, not worth the price",This product had alot of interference when I tried it and we decided to return it within a day. The static in the background is quite annoying.
1,The absolute worst!,"If I could give this transmitter 1/4 star I would. That is how awful this thing is. I noticed that some people gave it glowing reviews and I can't for the life of me figure out how. This thing delivers nothing but static, and bad sounding static at that. The signal goes in and out constantly without reprieve. After I used it the first time I tried to make my myself believe that perhaps the crappy reception and bad sound quality was a one time isolated incident, and gave it multiple chances to change my mind. NOPE. I ended up hardwiring my ipod into the car, which in hindsight is what I should have done in the first place.Most recently I tried using it in my girlfriend's car on the way back from Florida. I was 1/2 second from throwing the thing out of the window. It's junk. Period. Forget it. If you buy this you'll be sorry. Belkin should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a sad item."
1,low end electronics,"these wear out immediatly with any daily use. The wires seperate from the broadcast pod, resulting in static and eventually failure. Do not buy this product. Not worth the money."
2,Alright for the price.....I guess,"I was a little surprised when I saw what these were going for online. I found mine at Walmart for [...]. I knew right from the jump it would not sound as good as the many others that sell for upwards of [...], and Boy was I right. The sound quality is less than par. I did mess around with location in the vehicle and that did help a little. I'm planing on adding a longer cord since the one it comes with is ridiculously short. I heard this will greatly increase performance as the cord doubles as the transmit antenna. All in all, if your looking for a cheap way to get sound into your CD player and have no input jack, this will work. Barely"
2,Works but sounds terrible,I have to agree with a better portion of the reviews on here.It works but the sound is terrible - muffled & alot of background noise.I gave it 2 stars because it does function but would have only given it 1 star for the sound quality alone.Find something else.
1,Aggressively unlikeable,"This is the single worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned. I wish I'd seen the reviews on amazon before I'd bought it. Where to start? It eats batteries like mad, and no, you can't use rechargeable batteries with it; I tried that first. The only other option is to use the car adapter, which doesn't fit the hole on the unit. In fact, I thought I was using the wrong adapter at first. When mine did work, the FM signal was very weak and loaded with static. And that gets me to my last point- it broke after only a few uses. Trust me, it was a mercy killing. Belkin's other units might be better but I sure won't be finding out."
1,Very bad product!,"I had this product for my first Mp3 player and it could barely find a station in my house, using it in the car was a joke. I would not reccomend this product to anyone."
1,Not powerful enough - didn't give clear signal,"I bought this to replace a GE unit that the wires keep breaking on, but this unit doesn't have enough signal strength to provide a clear signal. I was so disappointed I returned this unit, and am looking for a new unit."
2,Audio quality is disappointing,"I bought this because I want play my mp3 player in my car. I commute through the new york, new jersey area so I knew before I bought it that it might struggle against the megawatt stations that dominate the FM frequencies here. It does struggle, but I have found a few freqencies that are passable. I planned on removing the built-in attenuation to get a better signal, but I'm not sure I'll bother anymore.The killer for this product for me is the audio quality. It is nowhere near as good as a decent FM station, better than a cell phone connection, and maybe better than AM. My car has a stock stereo in it with pretty average sound, but I wasn't willing to take the additional hit to sound quality so will find another way to listen.I guess it depends on expectations whether this is a great product or one for the back of the cupboard. It certainly worked as it said it would, I just expected better sound quality."
1,Bad reception....,"I don't recommend this ones, because it doesn't give a good volume on your receiver."
2,Can't hear over the white noise,"I just got this today, and in addition to having overpaid for it at a local retailer I can't hear anything over the white noise. I put my radio right next to it to make sure I had the dial on the right station, and even right next to it I still get an incredible amount of static. It doesn't seem to matter how low or high I have the volume on either device. I just wanted it to transmit from my computer to my home radio/stereo so I could listen to an AM station at night. The static seems to drastically reduce when I am physically touching/holding the transmitter, but I don't know why and obviously I am not going to sit there and hold the stupid thing all night. Good luck."
1,Belkin FM Transmitter,"My friend gave me as a Christmas present. It's a great concept, but I'm disappointed with Belkin's performance. First of all, the cable is too short, and kills 2AAA battery really quick (need rechargeables), and the quality is just not there. The sound quality is the biggest disappointment. I consider myself a big music lover and i expect good enough sound quality. I put my volume at 16-18 for CDs, but I have to turn it up to 25-26 for Belkin to have the same volume, and it still isn't anywhere near the same quality as CDs."
4,"Great warranty, geat sound","I've tried this transmitter in both the city and country and had perfect results in both locations. The car adapter made a cross country trip perfect but it's nice for even short drives. All you need is to click the saved preset station and press play and you're all set. It works equally well practically anywhere in the car and I've had very little trouble with static. The sound quality isn't perfect but I was surprised how good it was considering all of the complaints in reviews. Also, considering Belkin's warranty the price is good if you don't buy it for the full suggested retail. I recommend it."
1,Poor qaulity Item,"I live in the Northeast where the tempature goes below zero a great deal. I bought the Belkin transmitter to play my MP3 player through my existing auto stereo. The first unit worked a couple of days then died, I returned it and got a new one and it also died. It wasn't the batteries as I replaced them, it might have been the cold weather but it simply should not have occurred. The unit is just junk and repeated effrots to get help from Belkin was for naught.A better choice is the IRiver AFT100 Mobile FM Transmitter, which requires no battery, has a blue backlight so you can easily see the frequency, and is close the the same price as the Belkin. It has withstood a couple of months of extremely cold weather and is still ticking. It is the better buy, you will be much happier!"
4,Battery Life,"Using the 2 AAA batteries alone, the life of the transmitter is not great. But in the car, used wiht the included car power adapter, the product works great. There is a difference in volume when switching from battery to adapter power. I have no complains as to the trasmission quality."
2,Not impressed,"The first one that I bought quit working after four hours. Also, it didn't come w/ a cigarette lighter adapter so I had to buy one from Belkin for $19 (I did this before the transmitter quit working).I sent the unit back to Belkin ($7 in shipping), waited over two weeks, then got the new unit (which came w/ a power adapter). It's supposed to turn on automatically when the MP3 player is turned on, but it doesn't. I have to turn it on manually.The way that it's designed makes it hard to mount cleanly in my car (Ford Explorer). The cord from the transmitter to the MP3 player is about 6 inches long. I had to buy an extension cord at Radio Shack.Sound quality is not good. The music sounds like it's coming from an old AM mono radio, regardless of the FM station setting. At first I thought the problem was with my stereo, but when I play a CD, it sounds normal.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this. I'm going to buy an iRiver."
2,Much better options out there,Used to have this one till the input cord started crapping out. Was never fully satisfied as it took some contstant adjusting around the car during most of commute. Decided on a new one and picked up the Griffin iTrip. Superior to the Belkin as the signal is much stronger and cleaner. Plus no cord mannagement issues. Highly reccommended
4,Good Stuff,"When I first test it I was really disapointed because I could not get a decent sound, not even next to the antenna of the radio, I though that the transmitter was a scam.Later on, I tried again and voila! It worked. The problem was that the transmitter relay on the ipod volume for the transmittion power. This means that in order to get a clear sound you need to set your ipod volume to the highest.Summary (with the max volumen):* Must be close to the receiver.* If is on range, the sound is clear.* Easy to use* Do not use the iPod battery for transmittionI'm giving it 4 stars because the transmittion power is not controlled on the transmitter device but on the iPod volumen, and because of that, the transmittion range is not what I would have expected."
2,Waste of money,"Reception both in my house on 2 different stereos and in 3 different cars was all equally abysmal. There was always static and I obviously couldn't find a good station. I live in a suburb of Denver, and although we have quite a few radio stations, I was expecting it to at least find one good station. I gave it 2 stars because the interface seemed to work well and set up was easy."
2,wouldn't recommend purchasing,"This device worked for a few months, then the ""auto-off"" feature kept activating; it appears that the wire connecting the device to my mp3 player had a short in it. In addition, the DC plug auto adapter didn't fit well in my car and the other end fell out of the TuneCast quite easily.As for the actual audio quality and all that? I appreciated the station pre-sets. I found that the device was much more reliable powered from the car than from the batteries."
1,NO GOOD,"I am a serious audiophile. I love loud and clear sound. I bought this thinking that it would have higher quality sound than the cassette adapters not to mention it would be more convenient. I was WRONG! This is a waste of money. I strongly recommend purchasing a cassette adapter as they offer a much higher quality sound. Don't even waste time thinking to buy this item. It is a total piece of [...]. In case anyone is wondering, I live in a suburb of LA and we have a ton of radio stations out here. This thing is useless anywhere near a big city. I'm not sure how it would perform in the middle of nowhere, but in my experience, it was a waste of time and money. Two days after I bought it, I returned it."
4,Does Its Job!,"I went into buying a transmitter very skeptically. I was convinced by others comments it would sound no better then and am radio. But I did very much want to use my ipod in the car, so I gave it a try.This Belkin does its job. I found a clear station and I don't get any interruptions. The sound is good (fm quality) and I can now have any song I want at my finger tip. It's a shame thought it hangs off the side, not as pretty as some other models but it's a small issue.I am not and audiofile and i'm not as picky as some people, but i'm very happy with my purchase.#8 months later... stopped working...no explaination"
1,Belkins TuneCast II isn't worth it.,"I was looking for an fm tuner to use in my car for going down the highway. i'm not rich and this one was the cheapest i could use with my new Sansa Clip. but only to find out that i GOT cheap. all i got was static when i tried to use it in the car and home sterio. the range (according to Belkin.com) is 10 to 30 ft. with 10 or less being optimal. so i went to their web site and looked up the best options to tune the radio to (like the directions say) only to find that even with the transmitter sitting ON TOP OF the sterio (clearly less than 10 feet away) all i got was static with a very slight hint of music. and the worst thing is i'm not even from a town with heavy fm signals. i tried high, i tried low, and even in the middle of the fm band and got static. ok, yeah, some where better than others but none were even remotely close to being listenable."
2,Died after a few weeks,"Bought this for $12.95 on clearance from Blockbuster (why they even had them beats me). It worked OK on the correct stations, but died after a few weeks. Now, won't turn on via battery or car power. So, while concept was all right, the implementation was lacking. Looking for something else. They all seem overpriced, given what they do."
1,Didn't work for me,"I am very good with electronic gadgets but I had no luck whatsoever with the Belkin Tunecast II. I had to place the unit very close to my radio to get reception. Even then, the signal was weak and the sound quality was horrible."
4,It's OK,I received the item in a very timely manner as I have grown to expect when dealing with Amazon and it works just fine.
2,Mediocre at Best,I found this Belkin FM Transmitter to be barely adequate. No matter what free FM frequency I tuned to it could not provide a clear channel for my MP3 player. There was a lot of static and I found my player was hard to hear clearly. Within a short time this trasmitter has became more of a nuisance and I no longer use it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,BRAND NAME LET DOWN,"PURCHASED BELKIN TRANSMITTER BECAUSE I HAD HEAR GOOD THING ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. ITEM WORKS, BUT ON FIRST WEEKEND ROAD TRIP STARTED PICKING UP STATIC, CHECKING ITEM FOUND COVERING OVER WIRES ALREADY CRACKED AND UNIT WAS SHORTING ITSELF. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
2,Weak FM Transmitter,"Have found the transmitter to have very poor range compared to other units. In my auto it only works if placed on the dash near the external antenna. In my home, only works if placed within a few feet of the receiver. The other unit I have for an Ipod and portable DVD unit works excellent from anywhere in my vehicle and up to 20 feet without interference in my home."
2,Terrible: Complete Waste of $$$$ MONEY,"Even when standing close to a radio, the signal is week, fades in an out. At first I thought it was just the battery, so I switched that, same result, very poor performance. I also switched the radio I was using, result, poor performance. I have an FM transmitter that comes with the XM Roady Radio, so I was expecting similar but not exact performance from this Belkin product. Sure the two are not exact comparisons because one runs off of DC power and the other runs off of battery power, but still, the XM Roady transmitter out performs the Belkin when I have the XM Roady transmitter transmitting from my car parked outside in the garage, and the Belkin is 3 feet from the same radio.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND LOOK ELSEWHERE!!http://gaskin.dyndns.org"
2,"Good when it lasts, very flimsy connection to the ipod","The signal is strong and the unit was relatively easy to use. Bu because of the design of the output jack, the system only lasted 6 months and the output jack was pretty much in pieces with the wires showing after this time. This unit is now unusable. Do not buy."
1,Terrible reception,"No matter what I did, or how many ""help"" reviews I went to online, I could not get any clear station. I live in the country! I can't imagine trying to use this in the city."
3,Not good enough,"I bought this product thinking that it would be nice to have an FM transmitter for the long trip between my house and school. Well, I wish I would have thought about it. The FM signal is weak. The sound quality is sub-par, the tuning doesn't go low enough, and the lcd screen is dark and hard to read. If you have a cassette player, buy the cassette apapter. You can get one for less than $10. Don't spend $30 on this unless you really need it. And even then, consider buying a brand name iTrip."
5,Great Product!!!!!,"I think this FM transmitter is supurb!I live in NYC, and I have no problems finding an open station.This thing is a marvel at a reasonable price, especially when you consider the options it has.1)Choose from any Frequency, not just ones the company feels you should use.2)Dual power supply(batteries or car plug)3)4 programmable presets.4)Lighted LCD screen for night use.5)Auto on/off feature (helps to save batteries)6)Compact and good looking IMO"
2,Easy to use. The sound quality is bad.,This is a easy to use plug and play product. It works but the sound quality is not even close to the FM radio. I get static all the time. It sounds like I am listening a radio station 120 miles away. I would not recommend this to anybody unless you just want some background noise in your car while you drive.
2,Unhappy user,"Even though you can set the FM frequency to anything, it sounds totally aweful. I tried to use this while driving in different parts of New England and the result was uniformly disappointing."
4,Item,"Don't know much about the item because it was a gift that was given to someone. I did not use it, but the service to get the item was fantastic."
1,Very Disappointing,"My expectations were not high. But a range of less than 3 feet (unless you hold it in your hand to increase range) is simply unacceptable.Then there's the quality of the sound. Horrible! No highs, no lows. 'Muffled' best describes the sound.I'm taking it back first thing in the morning.--Dan"
1,Works For The First Week Then Dies,"I thought this was a great idea until after I had it for about a week. Then the reception started going bad; I switched stations to no avail, and then it decided to stop playing in one of my speakers (not the fault of my speakers, I used this in my mother's new truck and it did the same thing after a couple days). Very Frustrating!!!!! I'm off to buy a cassette adapter (iTrip sounds nice but also sounds like it eats alot of batteries).Oh and the Belkin drained my batteries quickly b/c the sound was always so low I had to turn my iPod up almost the whole way,a nd then my stereo up almost the whole way.Buy something else! DO NOT get this!!!!"
2,Not worth for price Tag of $30+,"I bought this product in much anticipation after readding a lot of tech description & reviews this wknd mainly to hookup my Sony Vaio laptop's music in my Sony Home theater whcih has Radio also.Sure setup was easy and quick. Look & feel of the item is also pleasant but quickly all these Pluses turned in to minuses with the Bad sound quality. Transmission produces so much noise and few times all of a sudden transmission was dropped, surely i had turned radio's volume high and all of sudden it bursted in to loud noise that my 2 year old daughter started crying...After setup if you come in way of transmission or move the product to find better reception it kills the whole joy of listening stereo sound... its a nightmare.. avoid this for home use...its supposed to be working perfectly with in 30Feet i even tried 1 feet....then GAVE UP.It may be good for Car with in close range"
1,Poor performance and then died,I purchased one of these in the middle of April. The first problem I noticed was the volume level from the transmitter. I needed to increase the volume on my fm radio to twice the volume level I normally used to play other broadcasts. This caused other interference to also amplify. The second problem I noticed was with the battery life. The batteries died after less than 4 hours of use. It uses 2 AAA batteries which needed to be replaced a couple times a day. The third problem with the unit was when it died three weeks later. I can't say I'm sorry to see it go. My experience with this unit is that it has very poor performance and it will not last. Do not purchase this unit.
2,Works great if I hold my MP3 player straight up in the air while I'm driving!,"After setting up the Tunecast II Mobile FM Transmitter to my MP3 player, static and a low frequency hum was very apparent on any station I tried to sync to. I thought it was my player so I switched to a CD player with the same results. I found I could increase or decrease the static and low frequency hum by moving the MP3 or CD player so that the cords from the player to the Transmitter were at specific angles. The Tunecast II works great if I hold the player around the area of the rear view mirror. Of course the blood runs out of my arm after awhile and I may eventually need rotor cuff surgery but I saved money by going 'cheap'. It's great to read all the 'tech' reviews but I'm simple, either it works or it doesn't and in my opinion, it doesn't."
2,Don't expect much...,"You have to really want or need to hear your audio stream through an FM radio to justify buying this item. It basically does what it is supposed to do, but there is a constant whistle in the background. Also, there seems to be an inconsistent output level as the volume rises and falls. As long as you keep the Tunecast within a few feet of the radio and in some cases orient it's position just right, then the sound quality is listenable. Even at that, a scratchiness is usually present along with the whistle. Living in a metro area with very little empty space on the FM band is likely part of the problem. At least the digital tuning, with 4 settable frequencies, is a plus.If music clarity is important, then forget it; find another way. If, as in my case, the purpose is to hear speech off of an MP3 player or by way of a 900Mhz receiver, and you get a price marked way down from list, then it could work for you."
2,Not worth it,"The concept is really great and I was really looking forward to it. I used it in my car to listen to audio books. The biggest problem with it was that I had to turn the volume all the way up on my radio and still couldn't hear the book. It is possible that this wouldn't be as much of a problem with music, but for me it's worthless"
4,An FM transmitter that works,"In a nutshell: This product does what it's supposed to do.If you are reading this you are probably thinking of buying it because your car doesn't have a cd/cassette player (like my 1997 civic). Be aware that the sound you are getting is FM quality, which for me is enough to listen to my music while driving to work.Pros:-Cheap solution for a radio-only equipped car-Turns on automatically when it detects music from the MP3 player.-Can transmit to any frequency in 0.1MHz increments (find a frequency not in use in your area for the best sound)Cons:-Connector cable to MP3 player is extremely short.-Has cigarette lighter power, but still requires batteries!Bottom line is that it works just fine if you don't mind having less than perfect quality sound."
2,"Just a bit better than ""don't work at all""","I had some pretty bad experience with Belkin products in the past, so I am not sure why I decided to (1) ignore my past experience, and (2) ignore the reviews of others here on Amazon. Call me dumb. Now, I hope you won't make the same mistake.It's not that the product doesn't work at all. You will be able to hear something in your car, but the quality will be so bad that you'll quickly give up on this product. And my expectation wasn't high: I haven't even tried to listen to music; I was just listening to audio books and podcasts. I wasn't hope for hi-fi, just for something audible and pleasant. But that was far from it.Alex"
2,No worth it!!,It works but sound quality sucks. if you like good sounding music dont waste your money!!
2,Not so good for me,"I had this unit before I tried the iRiver 100 AFT (which by the way is fantastic). Basically, on my 20 minute commute into work, this thing was worthless. Lots of static, interference and bleed over from other channels. I tested both units on the same frequency 88.1 and the iRiver blew this out of the water.Check out the iRiver before you decide and see which one may work better for you. My Zen and I urge you."
2,can't get it to work,"I can't get this thing to work. If I can get it to turn on, which is still a problem after two sets of batteries, there is so much static that I can barely hear my book on tape. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, and I can't tell what the difference in conditions is. I'm going to get an FM module installed in my car stereo."
2,Not so good,"Well, it does what it is supposed to do: it is an FM transmitter, but the signal is really poor, in fact, if it is not placed near the receiving radio you will not be able to receive the signal. I tried with all the available stations and even in a city where there were only one or two radio stations and still the signal was really bad. It only works if is placed right next to the receiving radio.I would not buy this thing again."
1,Waste of Time,This product is a complete waste of time... the signal is complete static. I had a radio right next to my computer and I got a little sound that was overpowered by static. This was a complete disapointment on all levels. Do not bother buying this product.
1,Terrible tool for MP3's,"I received my initial Tunecast Transmitter as a gift. After two uses the unit stopped working. I returned it to WalMart and the same thing happened again with another one. The cost of this item is no chump change, you'd think it would be of better quality."
1,ripoff cheapo junk from Belkin,"two days after fresh batteries were installed, it fails againthe car charger (cig. lighter adapter charger) is a P.O.S. toobuyer beware!the unit does NOT charge your mp3/digital audio player either"
2,Not exactly the best buy,"I got this at first very excited that i would no longer have to use what is now consider old a cassette adapter. I was gunna use this fm transmitter for my ipod but as soon as i started using it, i realized this product wouldn't be as good as i thought it would be. I tried probably 10 different radio stations even ones when there's no real broadcasting for. But the quality was horrible. You could hear the static in the background even with the volume reasonably low. I immediatly took it back to best buy and thank goodness got it refunded. I know i am one of the few people with this problem and it seems others don't have the same problem i did. Maybe i didn't do something right but for me this product didn't perform well for what i had to pay to get it. I'm still fine with my cassette adapter even it's consider out of style now ;)"
2,Don't bother.,"The transmitter works about as well as I would expect a radio-quality broadcast to do...when it actually WORKS. It's supposed to turn on whenever it detects music playing on the attached MP3 player, but I've found that it only does so about half the time with my iPod classic and even less than that with my Shuffle. The power adapter is terrible, as well - it doesn't even fit in the outlets of several cars I've tried, and with several others you have to hold it in just the right place or else it falls out. It also has a weak signal strength and cuts out at random times (I suspect that at times it's been overridden by FM transmitters in other cars next to me while I was on the freeway).It's okay, I guess, but I would just avoid it in the first place and spend a little extra for a transmitter that actually works."
4,"Pretty good product, here's how to make it better","I bought this Belkin product. It works OK. You can improve its performance by adding a cable between the audio source (iPod, mp3 Player, etc.) and the Belkin FM Transmitter. The short (4"") input cable is part of the transmitter's antenna. If you put a longer than 19"" cable in between, it makes the unit VERY VERY GOOD, 75% improvement in performance. Here is one link: [...]. That's a Radio Shack Part Number 2102968. Buy a shorter one if you can find it. Otherwise, 4 stars..."
2,Wimpy,"I've now returned two of these. The unit doesn't recognize signal from your MP3 player unless the volume is turned up high enough to deafen you with regular headphones, and then sometimes it still doesn't notice that the MP3 player is on and playing. If you find a completely unused frequency you can hear pretty well, but you have to turn the volume way up on your stereo too."
2,Disappointing product,"Yes, this product marginally does what is claimed; however, understand that reception will be poor and full of static, and your speakers will cut out. At one point I honestly believed that I blew a speaker until I had the same problem with the unit in a different vehicle. Maneuvering it into just the correct position to get reception in all speakers reminds me a lot of the old style ""rabbit ears"" we used to use with our televisions. I have experience with three separate units, all bearing the same result. I don't know of a better quality product of the same type, but don't think this will be comparable to listening to your mp3 player using headphones or any other traditional method. It is more similar to trying to get decent radio reception from a place where the transmitter is 2 hours away."
2,avoid if you live in or near a major city,"Like other fm transmitters I have tried, this one leaves much to be desired. Living in a major urban area, I was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality. Product is easy to use, but I consider the sound quality unacceptable."
2,"Good features, bad quality","I'm really disappointed with this product. Even though it has some good features like auto switch and dual power system, the output signal is too weak and sounds terrible too. Definitely this unit doesn't worth the money I paid for it."
1,Broke after 2 months,It worked fine for a while. The static wasnt too bad as all the other reviews say. Then all of a sudden it wouldnt turn on. Changed the batteries still wouldnt turn on. Dont buy this shiz.
2,Good Idea. Execution weak.,"This is a great idea, but I have been unable to broadcast using this device without a lot of static. Even with the device only a couple of feet from my FM radio, there is still static. Thanks, but I will have to find another way to listen to my MP3s."
2,"Works all right, but didn't last long","It works as described. I found it slightly annoying that one had to reset the frequency on the transmitter every time one started the car, but that was a minor annoyance.It lasted about three months without trouble. Then it started being somewhat unreliable. Sometimes it would come on, and sometimes it wouldn't. I found that jiggling the power cable would sometimes get it to start, and that it ran on batteries reliably (although the signal seems weaker with batteries). Finally even jiggling didn't work, so I opened the device up and found one of the wires was apparently loose inside. Jiggling it allowed me to keep the device working for a few more months. All together it lasted about eight months. I ended up buying a device that allows my iPod to connect directly to the car stereo (if you own a Mazda, check out sylfex.com. If you own a different kind of car, there are other solutions, such as ICElink)."
3,Good Enough,"The sound quality on this is as expected. Radio frequency equals radio quality so don't expect any CD quality. The only problem I had with this transmitter was that everytime i move it around the car or even select tracks on my ipod, i get static on my speakers, so make sure you dont move it around too much. Plus my power adapter just died on me for no apparent reason. (Around after a year of using.) Overall, i think the product is okay, but I would suggest you first look at transmitters that connect to the cigarette lighter and has a gooose neck attached so that you won't need to move it around too much."
4,Good quality,"The signal strength of this FM transmitter is by far the best that i have seen. The people on here that give the crappy reviews, well it is because they more then likely do not know how to properly use the device. I have yet to hear static or white noise, all I hear is pretty good sound quality, and I am on to only like variable bit rate music in the 200-300 ranges. These people that say it is bad, really just need to learn how to use it."
3,"Convenient, but lacks full Audio Range and is weak","+ This little transmitter is fun and conveniently compact.- The human ear can hear audio frequencies from 20Hz to 20kHz. (Google: Human Audible Range) However, this little transmitter clips the audio range it is transmitting down to 50Hz to 15Khz. (Google: F8V3080 Audio Range) Resulting in horrible low-end and high-end sound reproduction.- Signal amplifier on this little unit is so weak that if it isn't sitting on my dashboard in my car while transmitting my car stereo will not detect the signal at all. With it sitting on my dashboard I can receive a scratchy, weak signal.This little unit is fun, but not what I was looking for. I ended up just throwing mine away as the store I purchased it from wouldn't take it back."
2,It works - but its signal is weak.,"I have been using it for about a month to listen to mp3 audio books in the car and on the jam box. Works with the jam box great because you can place the transmitter next to the radio antenne. In the car however, I can't get a clean signal anywhere inside."
2,Don't buy this item,Very poor performance. Signal is very weak. You have to turn the volumn to maximum.
3,Not very powerful transmitter.,"Not a comparative review, so I'm not sure how other similar items work, but I purchased this product with the plan to transmit music from my PC to my hi-fione floor below but almost directly above..I live in the NY area and I'm guessing there are just too many FM transmissions, so it was very hard to find a free slot to use.. but even on the ones that seemed to be ""free"" - I got a lot of static on the transmission that made it unpleasant to listen to music."
3,This product works well.,The Belkin transmitter is a decent device. It works well for its price. The only fault that causes the rating to slip three stars instead of five is that the lighter adapter connection became loose only after a few uses. On occasion when lightly touched or when riding over a small bump the transmitter fails to transmit due to connection loss. Other than this it is a good device.
3,Correcting the reception on the belkin,"The belkin is very nice cosmetically, but like it's competitors, provides poor transmission. If you look at any of these units, there are no antennas! This is the problem. A good antenna is 1/4 of the wavelength you are trying to transmit or recieve. In this case, about 2 feet for FM. Here is the solution. If you can solder, a BIG if, open your belkin, and solder a 2ft long wire of wire-wrap quality to the antenna solder point. It is one of the solder points the plug is soldered to. MAke sure it is the right one. There are solder points for left, right, ground, and antenna. Choose antenna. Let the soldered wire hang outside the unit. You will be amazed by the improvement. Find a friend to do it for you!"
1,Unfortunately a worthless accessory,"I really looked forward to giving the Belkin transmitter a try. The concept is perfect - a totally portable music library accessible anywhere. I thought of all the places I could play my music, home stereo, both cars, workshop, office. My first try was with my home stereo. I could hear the music, but the quality was less than sub-par. The next day I hooked it into my car system, the sound (noise) was even worse than in the house. I have tried a variety of frequencies with no luck on any of them. Since I live in a fairly rural area of PA, I can't imagine it is a problem with competing signals. I am extremely disappointed in this product. Not having this option really limits the versitility of my Dell DJ30. Save your money, don't buy this product."
3,disappointing (updated June 2005),"This device SEEMED easy to use and very stylish, but in a major metropolitan area, very frustrating. Find a ""clear"" frequency? Doesn't exist. Even when i find a frequency that delivers tolerable sound, I still get frequent buzzes and static.UPDATED: I've found that performance improves greatly depending on where I put the tunecast in the car.UPDATE 2: The automatic on/off has become a real problem! 4 out of 5 times it won't turn itself on when you start the ipod. I've found I have to remove and reinsert the batteries into the tunecast, to ""reboot"" it, before it will play. Sometimes I have to remove and rearrange the batteries 5 times before it finally starts to work. It's reached the point where I want to toss it out the window some days."
4,Value and convenience,"I bought this to play music from the burgeoning collection on my pc through my hi-fi. Simplicity itself to set up, the sound is acceptable - ideal for casual listening or programming an evening's music when entertaining. Admittedly not suitable for 'serious' listening, I found this solution excellent value for my purposes.In a domestic setting (less than ten feet between equipment),interference is negligible. If you're in doubt as to it's suitability for your needs, in my view it's worth a try, at the price."
2,NOT IN STEREO,"That's right folks, take your great mp3 player and reduce the sound to mono with a nice hiss. Didn't they get rid of that in the 60's?. I had to open it up and add an antenna to even make it work at all, search ""tuncast mod"" for that. Very disappointed, go to cruchfield for a wired in solution or the transmitter from C Crane may be the only choice that works."
3,Works but disappointing sound quality,"While the Belkin TuneCast II is the best FM transmitter for portable audio I have tried, the sound quality it transmits to your FM radio is still very disappointing.On the plus side, as others have pointed out, it's really easy to use, and it can be set to any FM frequency. The memory function is a bit complicated, though. It can be powered by either 2 AAA batteries, or the included car DC adapter.But in the department where it should perform well, it fails. Although it does give better, cleaner sound than the other devices I've tried, it's much worse than a typical FM radio station. Even on a clean frequency the sound you get is teeny and muffled. BTW, the manual says you should leave the volume on your portable audio at mid-level, while in fact you'll find yourself having to crank the volume all the way up on both the portable audio player and the FM radio.I'm keeping this despite being unhappy about it, since there's no other alternative."
3,"Testing 1,2,3....","I appreciate the fact that Belkin makes a transmitter for those of us with cars in between the AUX outlet that is now pretty standard on newer cars. This is my second transmitter from Belkin but the one from before was a different model. I would say that it's great & have no issues but then I would be lying. The main thing is I hear static playing with my music the entire time which is so frustrating!! I don't know if it's just where I live because no matter how many times I search, even while I'm driving, not a good idea I know, but it cannnot pick up a clear channel. I have a dozen channels I'll try throughout my drive & even have an extension for ""better reception"" but it's just not working. The other was sooooooo much better but I can't find it anywhere (same shape & everything except it was white). I guess it will just have to do & it was pretty cheap so you get what you pay for."
2,okay while they are working,I've owned 4 of these over the years and they all stopped working. From shorts in wiring to just not broadcasting for whatever reason I'm a little disappointed with these units. The one year warranty will most likely see you through but after that all bets are off.
2,DO NOT BUY,"Do not purchase this item. It is cheap and rarely works. It is horrible at night when more stations can come through your stereo. I live in the middle of the mountains, so i can't even imagine how bad this item is to use in the big city."
1,Stopped working after four months,"This product worked all right for the first few months that I used it. I used it almost daily for my commute. The reception had a bit of static in some locations, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. However, it just stopped working suddenly after only about four months. Overall, it was not worth buying."
4,Works great for me!,"Don't expect great sound from any FM Transmitter. Direct plug into the stereo/speakers is best. Cassette adapter is second best (if you have a functioning cassette player). FM Transmitters are probably going to give you some static, especially at higher volumes, but can work well enough to make your drive a little better.I wanted a way to listen to my Sony Walkman MP3 player in my car. My tape deck has issues and I don't use it enough to make it worth while to replace it. The Belkin FM Transmitter was the most affordable FM Transmitter I could find with a lighter adapter (didn't want to mess with batteries all the time) so I figured I'd give it a try. I live in a rural area with lots of open frequencies. I just tuned to one and the Belkin worked right away. I couldn't hear any static at the volume I would typically listen at, so it works for me. And at the present time, other FM Transmitters are going for twice the price as this one."
1,Not worth it!,Pro's: NONECon's: My tape player works better than this! Don't get this product unless you want to end up returning it at a later date.
1,Turns off and on randomly,Absolutely terrible product. It started to randomly turn off and would not turn back on after only a month of having it. Big waste of money. Get a transmitter that connects to the bottom (dock connector) of your ipod instead.
2,Eh....,"If this is the only solution for listening to whatever it is you want in your car, go for it, but a better investment would be another car stereo with an auxillery port + cable. No static with that setup. I'm sure static is a problem with a lot of these transmitters but like I said, why bother with one of these when you get a much better solution like the afformentioned."
1,Could not be a worse product.,"I returned this the day after I bought it. I know sound quality is never perfect with transmitters, but this was beyond terrible (and I've used them before, so I know how to pick a good station!). I couldn't even listen to it. It also just kept turning itself off after a few minutes! If you're going to buy a transmitter, spring for a good product."
1,Too much static,"Most times I can get electronic products to work right out of package but so far, have not had good success with Tunecast. I am getting too much static on most frequencies and the range seems to be limited."
1,It was horrible,"I bought this device with a little scepticism because I either saw a really good review or a really bad review. I tried it anyway, expecting maybe a little fuzziness in the reception or decreased volume. I did not expect, however, for the device to not work at all! I put batteries in it, it did not turn on, even if I manually turned it on. I then plugged it into the car cigarette lighter, it still did not turn on. I was very disappointed! I don't know if it was a bad pick or if they all just suck. Spend more money on a good one."
2,Good Idea But Bad Performance,"This is a neat, handy little gadget but it failed to perform to my expectations. The sound quality is terrible. If you like listening to FM stations with lots of static, then this is for you. Otherwise, stay away. Far away. If you must try it out, please buy from a local store and NOT online because you will want to return it and online purchases are a pain to return."
1,Difficult to use. Doesn't over power competing stations.,"I purchase the Tunecast II because I thought it would be an upgrade to my irock 400FM. Guess again. It was very difficult to use and the signal strength wasn't as good. It didn't lock on in stereo if there was any signal at all on the underlying station and there was a lot of static. Also, there was a constant beeping tone that was transmitted along with the signal. Very annoying. It didn't save the last station setting and it took for ever to turn on or off automatically. I returned it. It wasn't worth the extra money."
3,"Transmit range SUCKS, but works for close distances","If you're going to use this product in a car, or if you place your portable MP3 player and this unit CLOSE to your home boom box, stereo receiver, etc., it will work well. However, if like me, you want to transmit your desk PC's MP3 music files to a boom box outside the house, or my stereo receiver on the other side of the house, near my patio (I run outside patio speakers from this stereo receiver), forget it. The FCC currently only allows for very low output transmit power (50 milliwatts or thereabouts?) on these devices, and the compromised antennas on these things don't allow for good range. It would be great if the FCC allowed for more output power, let's say 100 milliwatts or more, as well as better antennas, so these devices had greater transmit range. The FCC needs to change the laws regarding these devices so the consumer can benefit better from increased range!"
3,its good but,"I use it a lot and it dose work better than most fm trans, but still has quality issues and static in the back ground every so often."
3,"Good value, but not good for long drive","Its good value for home use, but on the drive you get lots of disturbance."
5,Great support book,"Great read for women over 40. It gives them that chance to see, that life actually is more giving after 40.Passion is at heart and lays dormant and beat down for many woman over 40. When it's givin the opportunity to show itself, the longing that lingers inside them is stale. It lingers in women who feel they are drained and feel passion no longer exists,.. they feel beat down,they have nothing to look forward to. We all hold on to this very small pebble that is filled w/passion, that we hold onto for dear life. A pebble that represents a spark that keeps us going. It's small but we hold onto it.This book proves that life actually does start a 2nd chance for us women over 40 to be,..somebody!! It did for me!!!!I started my passion business at the age of 52 and Bam!! It's a success!!"
1,Where am I? What's my name?,"At the time of this review, Defying Gravity received no fewer than four stars from any reviewer! Am I living on a different planet? I read two stories. I read the second just to be sure the first wasn't the only badly written one in the book.Without being specific (because I would end up being sarcastic), I found the writing cliche-ridden, saccharine, and uninspired. I'm not implying that the women depicted in the book led uninspired lives. I'm saying that the writing is uninspired. There's nothing in it that cuts to the bone. Nothing is said in a fresh, intuitive way.This is the kind of stuff I used to read in the Ladies Section of the newspaper fifty years ago. It's writing with dimples, with mischievous eyes, wearing a pinafore.I'd rather scrub floors than read this book."
2,Sound and feel,"New to the nursing field, the store that I went to purchase my supplies did not have many stethoscope brands to choose from other than Prestige Medical. I bought this and when nursing school started I compared it to other brands.This stethoscope is so uncomfortable, heavy, and does not fit snugly in my ears. I am looking for another stethoscope that is lighter and fits better. The sounds are good, but wearing it is aggravating! It makes my ears hurt just writing this review."
3,Definitely not for professional or accurate use.,"I'm not a medical professional, all I needed was something basic for home use (actually to track down a bees nest inside a wall). I gave it 3 stars based on casual home use and low price, but if I needed something accurate for real health monitoring I would not recommend it and would have given it 2 stars.Pros - cheap, and you can hear vitals from a basic perspective, makes a great toy for a young person who is curious about medical stuff, and is ok for just general around the home use for the price.Cons - uncomfortable no matter which earpieces you use, and the sound quality is not very good, would not trust this for anything important! Found it difficult to hear vitals well, not clear, doesn't compare to professional / expensive ones at all."
3,Prestige Sprague Stethoscope,"This is a decent stethoscope. It gets the job done. I can hear pretty good through it. For the price if you just need a decent stethoscope and don't want to spend a whole lot, this is what you want. It's not as nice as some others I've owned but I got this one because it was very reasonable and it works pretty well. Its a bit heavy, that's really my only complaint about it."
4,Not really,"I wouldn't say this is music to shag by, but this is a good 60s soundtrack. 80% of these songs my oldies station stopped playing and this is a good CD to get. My favorite song on this is ""Love Is All Around""."
5,Brings back memories,"This music is a real blast from the past. It brings back memories of when I was young and heard songs on the radio that stuck in my brain. It is a very smooth compilation, among the best. The first song ""wives and lovers"" conjures up the days when wives stayed at home and men worked. You can picture in your mind another era of cocktail parties and cigarettes. Of course it sounds... nowadays, but fun. It's great singalong in the car music. Haven't checked out the amorous appeal-yet."
3,"An Austin-tatious, UNAUTHORIZED Exploitation, Baby!!","You know, ordinarily I would cry foul by such a lame cash grab, but frankly it looks like a pretty sound line up of Austinist retro. Still don't dig the misleading graphics, but I'll bet Mike Myers would actually have liked this to be the soundtrack, but the powermongers need MTV to sell movies. Oh well. Shame on you guys, anyway, oh behave etc. Good luck getting that ""shagadelic"" title frontracked in the shops in the U.K.!! (but I spose this being an online store, that's a moot point)"
4,Good,Good book. Good story. A little long. Not thrilled about the exposure to violence - the trains hit each other.
2,The book has a strong odor,As soon as we received the book my 2 1/2 year old son wants to me to read it to him. It's a cute book but as soon as we flip a page the book is extremely smelly. I'm guessing it's the type of ink they used to color in every picture but it's pretty bad. We have to read it outside so we don't suffocate from the smell. I didn't give it a 1 star only because my son loves everything thomas the train so he enjoys the book.
2,Imara run watch disappointment,"Other reviews noted that this watch is difficult to read, and this is certainly true. However, I bought the watch primarily for its interval function. Sadly, the beeps signaling the intervals are barely audible even with minimal ambient noise making this function useless."
4,shipping too high,"the tee arrived quickly, but the shipping prices were very high. 7 dollars for a teeshirt"
2,Box not as shown,"I received my order for Jovan Musk on time, but had to give a low rating as the box received had half a sticker as it was part of a two part promotional set. Therefore, I can't give this cologne as a gift."
2,Not for serious troubleshooting of industrial machines.,"It takes several seconds until the value of measured AC current stabilizes. This is not acceptable in servicing industrial machinery. Fast measurement is often more important than knowing exact RMS value. Quick in other settings though. 1ms peak max function (max amplitude recorded) not that much needed than lacking on that model 100ms integrated max value (like it is on Fluke). IR non-contact temperature measurement is a nice feature. Built in multimeter is not necessary, every electrician should have a separate multimeter.WHY THERE'S NO INDICATING BAR?"
4,Alice...,"Actually sounds more like Alice Cooper Schools out more than Sabbath to me. Great Album different direction, which is also very Alice like..not everything has to be exactly the same as long as its all good and this is great"
3,so-so,"I bought this cd not expecting much after sinister urge. i disliked that album, but i still wanted to give rob a chance. i think if it were by someone else, maybe an underground talent i would give this cd more stars. unfortunately it falls flat of all zombies previous work. i think maybe he should give up the music and stick to his real calling, movies, before he disappoints with another lackbuster performance as this.as for what another reviewer(s) said, i was surprised as well there was absolutely no cussing and no parental advisory on the cover. i thought i bought it at Best Buy, not Wal-mart. i searched all over, but i guess it was just released this way and wasn't an edited cd. maybe your kids will like it.oh yeah, it is only 11 tracks with 2 of those being extremely short. this should have been an EP. oh wait, all of Zombie's CDs are only about 11-13 songs long. Nevermind."
3,A Different Side of Rob Zombie,"I did not like this CD much for a while, but it did grow on me. Now I consider it to be one of my favortie rock CD of the CDs that I own, but I still like his older stuff a lot better. Nowhere near as good as Hellbilly Deluxe, but way better than HEllbilly Deluxe 2."
2,One Thumb Down...,"I know Rob's fans are a rabid lot (I know cos I count myself among them); so it pains me to say this new album is a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's quite enjoyable.. but nothing special. I had reservations before the release having read an old interview where Rob apparently says he doesn't give a s**t about music anymore, he's into making films now. Fair enough, he's been making music a long time now. Maybe it's understandable that he's tired of it and more interested in doing something new... Okay..so stick to the movies Rob. This album sounds tired and uninspired to me. Was it a contractual requirement ? I don't know. Even the artwork for the cd is lacking.. Remember how you could pour over a White Zombie / Rob Zombie cover/booklet for ages ? Maybe I have it all wrong.. I just don't feel any heart in this latest album. If Rob does continue to make music, I hope it rocks better than this.."
2,Not what I was hoping for!,"I am very reluctant to listen to the radio because there is really nothing good on it. So needless to say I had not heard the single ""Foxy Foxy"". I figured it's Rob Zombie, it's gonna rock. All I can say is that Rob fell flat off his educated horse on this one. The songs for the most part are not heavy. His vocals, while sounding more old school Zombie, still come across as weak to me. Not to mention he has John Lowery from Marilyn Manson fame on guitar, but even John's solo album ""Vertigo"" is overflowing with hard driving guitar / solo shredding on some of the tracks. So I will let the blame fall on Rob since the band is more than capable of rocking out. It is just and uneventful weak release that he should've just made another movie instead of recording. The lack of a Parental Advisory Sticker should've sent up a red flag to me but oh well. If you must have some Rob Zombie music, buy any other release and avoid this one."
1,"Rob, you disappointed me","I loved the previous releases, especially Hellbilly Deluxe but this....wow, what a shame. Sounds like Rob is trying to appeal to mall kids who are into Korn."
2,Flat...could/should be better!,"I like most of Rob & White Zombie's stuff. Maybe I'm getting older and heading in a different direction than Rob, but this is just NOT impressive. Where is the punch, drive, or energy? I can't see the old or recent Zombie fans giving this impressive reviews. 3 decent songs on the disc is not worth the $$."
3,Rob Zombie - 'Educated Horses' (Geffen) 3 1/2 stars,"Review no.66.I wasn't exactly sure,but this looks to be Rob's fourth solo effort.Maybe not his best work,but still very decent.Produced by Scott Humphrey(Metallica,The Cult,Triumph,Crue)so I thought at least the production and the pace of 'Educated Horses' were pretty happening.Tracks that I was most impressed with were the ass-kicking ""American Witch"",""17 Year Locust"",""Scorpion Sleeps"",""Death Of It All"" and ""The Devil's Rejects""(name of his latest movie-a must see).I've recently seen Rob Zombie on this very tour and it appears that he had scaled his live shows down a bit,but they're JUST as effective.Plain and simple,not a bad metal release.A should-have."
2,Buy something else 'cause it's BORING,"Well, all I can say is that I am disappointed. And that I should listen before I buy next time. I heard there was a new Zombie lp out, saw it at the store and bought it. Brought it home, hoping to enjoy and man, all I can say is that it's BORING. This is a tired Rob Zombie, not one hit - but all miss. And y' know what? Don't believe the hype, believe me, if you want something fun to listen to - buy the new Alice Cooper and pass on the Zombie. Plus it clocks in as a rip off - under 39 minutes."
4,Good not great.,"I like many of the tracks on this album. I think that John 5 is the best guitarist in rock n' roll. I know that this is a much different kind of album for Rob Zombie, but I think he needed to change it up a bit. My only complaint is that I kinda wished that he cussed a little on this album. Heah. I like it when my metal bands cuss."
2,More like a sophomoric effort,"I don't know what happened with this effort. I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge. However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it. And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music."
4,BUY IT!!!!,"This album rocks!!! I think American Witch is the only song that has the typical zombie sound. That's definetely not a bad thing!! Alot of creative stuff on here, my favorite song is The Scorpion Sleeps. I think it's one of the stand out songs on here that brings out a new Zombie, very cool rhythms. Even if I weren't familiar with Rob Zombie I would still picture demonic sesame street monsters dancing to it. It's a really great album if you like rob zombie or just really creative music."
2,what happened to the old Rob?,"Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature. I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion. A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it. BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!!!!!"
2,What the?,"This is an example of when good(or in this case Kick ass) artists go bad. This is like Zombie, only watered down. There isn't a track on here that starts your blood pumping and takes over your soul. I have been a fan since White Zombie, I have all CDs and movies, and been to see every concert that came my way. I sure hope this isn't the end."
1,Educated HorseCRAP!,"I've liked Rob Zombie from back in the day,and after reading some of the other reviews,I truly do NOT know what everyone is excited about with this CD.I guess Rob wanted to kill about 35minutes(total minutes of cd) and decided to record a CD real fast.This CD has nothing that as I am sitting here typing this out anything thing that stood out enough to give it a half way decent review.I wish we could leave the star rating system blank,cause this cd doesn't deserve the ""1"" that they made me post!Very dissapointing,as much talent as Rob has shown on the rest of his albums.I bought it,listened to it,sold it.Sorry Rob,please put a little more effort into your next album,PLEASE!!!!!"
2,WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!?"
2,Not what it used to be.,Rob Zombie has lost a few steps when it comes to good music. There are only two or three tracks on here worth listening to. At least he's making good movies. I guess he spread himself too thin.
2,Remember when Rob Zombie was cool?,"This is the one of the worst cds I have ever listened to. Not because the music is so wretched, but because Rob Zombie has so much more talent in him than what's shown on this album. If ""Astro Creep: 2000"" was a punch in the face, then ""Hellbilly Deluxe"" was like a slap in the face... ""Educated Horses"" would rank somewhere around pissing in the wind. This album is weak on all fronts. There is no hard rock song and nothing that true fans should be looking for. I'm a deep down fan of Rob Zombie, but he's seriously fallen off his bike musically. If you were hoping for something in the direction of his earlier work then you will be very upset with this album. If you're a poser who never liked White Zombie and thought that ""The Sinister Urge"" was a work of art, you will still probably not like this album all that much. If I ever met someone who thought this album was hardcore... I would punch them, slap them, and then piss on them."
3,Not the best,"1. Sawdust in the blood. 5/5 Great intro, provides the neccesary sounds for whats to come.2.American Witch. 5/5 Awesome song love it thanks M.r Zombie.3.Foxy Foxy. 5/5 So catchy an instant classic4.17 year locust. 2/5 Why oh why this song is pathetic im sorry but it is.5.The Scorpion Sleeps. 5/5 Best song on album best zombie song nuff said.6.100 ways. 3/5 Why do we need another instrumental?7.Let it all bleed out. Good but gets old fast. 3.5/58.Death of it all. 4/5 Is formula fatigue setting in. Yup!9.Ride 5/5 Thats more like it incredible song one of his best.10.The Devils Rejects. 3/5 Okay song guess it kinda sets the tone for his devils rejects movie which im gonna watch soon.11.The Lords Of Salem. 1.5/5 Ugh hideous song,why release it out into the open?Okay so my review has been critical of this album but i really think it was a fair review of an average cd."
1,"thanks, but no thanks","don't buy this lukewarm turd of an album...find it for free and be disappointed (you will, guaranteed).. like i did.thank god for the internet,albums like educated horsesh it deserve to be illegally downloaded a million times over.zomby doesn't deserve to make one red cent off this crap."
3,Got it for the Foxy Foxy track,"Now, I'm not a huge Zombie fan, but I really liked Hellbilly Deluxe, and once I recently saw the video for Foxy Foxy, I figured I should invest in another Zombie album. Well, it's ok, but not quite as good as I had expected. 3 stars. Now I wish I would have just downloaded the individual tracks in mp3, but Amazon didn't have that option, at least not yet at the time."
4,Return of Rob,"I'll agree with other that this album is Rob's least heavy album. That being said, I found it very enjoyable. The songs are easily accesible and probably the most mainstream sounding Zombie has ever put out. This album is sure to cater to a much wider scope of people then say, Hellbilly Deluxe. The beats and hooks are very catchy. It's defintely not his best effort but still a worthy album that shows how Rob is always progressing and never beating a certain sound to death. A+ to Rob Zombie for his innovation in music from the early White Zombie days to present."
3,Meh,"I loved Hellbilly Deluxe and the White Zombie records. However, this is nothing compared to his earlier work. I recently got to hear Foxy Foxy on the radio and I was pretty excited to hear a new Zombie song. I was pretty disappointed after I heard it. I hoped that the rest of the record wouldn't be so bland but sadly that was actually one of the better songs. Your money is better spent on the new Ministry record, Rio Grande Blood. RGB really suprised me. Unfortunately, the actual disk isn't available so I can't do a review for it yet."
2,I cant believe this,This cd is so bland and boring. What happened to the Rob Zombie who use to write songs like thunderkiss65 godslayer and every song on astrocreep 2000. I dont know who sold out worst metallica or rob zombie. Plus what is with all the fillers hes been putting on his album. I gave him a bit of mercy when sinister urge came out because that was a very rushed album. But theres no excuse for the poor music hes writing on this. What makes me angrier is that the album started off pretty good and heavy then foxy foxy came up and that song is ridiculously bad. Then the album just seems to go on and on. If you want a really good album I suggest every go out and buy the new Sepultura album it doesnt dissapoint.
1,not worth it,Fell way short of my expectations. Would not listen to any songs on this CD again. Love Zombie but this one has nothing special on it fairly bland. Would not purchase this CD and glad I didnt. And I'm not bias I'm a fan and haveb been since White Zombie. This CD just doesnt cut it.
5,rob zombie educated horses,dude any one who will buy this cd will be pleased because this is his best work yet. rob zombie is a metal god.
1,Tommyco GEL Kneelers are not worth the money,"I paid $20.00 each for two of these mats. First of all, the mats did not arrive in the color that I ordered. Secondly, the logo on one of the mats was backwards. Thirdly, the gel, inside of the mat has already broken down, where I have applied pressure with my knees. You can see patterns of the breakdown in the form of air bubbles inside the mat. I would not recommend that anyone pay the price they are asking for these mats. The mat does not offer enough cushion, anyway, and it is heavy to lug around. Thumbs down!"
3,Not useful for my requirements,"I bought this kneeler planning on using it in my job as a labor doula. The pad when placed on a hard floor was not at all comfortable or supportive.I realize my requirements may be different than others, hence my score of 3 stars as opposed to lower. I had my ACL replaced in my knee a few years ago and am in need of a truly supportive kneeler. Unfortunately, this is not it."
4,exactly as described,I garden a lot and I have a bad knee. Being able to kneel with a little bit of cushion really helps ease the pain. The soft gel is comfortable and the pad is easy to rinse off.
4,Great Pads,"This is my second purchase. These pads are fantastic. Thank you. Also, very, very prompt. I would like them to be a little larger and a maybe a little more cushiony. But overall, GREAT !"
1,Do not buy,"This item was not soft at all. It was hard, not at all like a gel.I sent them right back."
2,Not Exactly What We Expected!!,"The grinder is very solid and seemed to be of decent quality. The cutting disks were poorly machined and holes were full of metal shavings. After several attempts at cleaning the holes, we still cannot use the smaller disk without fear of having metal splinters in our meat. It is effectively useless to us unless we opt to purchase new disks. Definitely not worth the money if this is the quality you'll receive."
5,Excellent!!!,"I was really alarmed by the negative reviews for this product, but trusting Amazon I thought to give it a try. I bought the grinder for my Mom who is a great cook. Once she got the item, she made a sausage which was a big success with the whole family. She was so happy with the grinder's performance!!! Mom enjoyed the whole process because it was so easy with this excellent grinder.I do not understand where all the negative reviews come from, but our item was truly great!Highly recommend it."
1,Meat Grinder,Does not grind meat well. Stuffing sausage takes too long. Had to do it the old way with my thumbs. Would not recommend this product.
1,What a piece of crap!,I have had this meat grinder for awhile now and I have tried many ways to make it useful but I have reached the conclusion this is truly a piece of crap. The parts dont fit well which ends up making the meat more of a paste then a true ground product. Secondly the blades are just horrid and poorly machined.Everything has the potential for rust its nasty. I am going to keep this short and say buy a better grinder then this because it is unworthy of any attention or admiration. GARBAGE!
1,Piece of junk,This product is really bad.. I don't care about the POOR quality of the material; I care about that no piece of meat went through the grinder. Dont waste your money.
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this grinder. It came with two discs, both of which had holes that were way too big for fine grinding. When we went to clamp it to the kitchen counter, my husband was barely able to get it attached, as the opening on the grinder isn't big enough. Also, the grinder and all assorted pieces rusted almost immediately upon cleaning. I suppose you get what you pay for. I'll continue looking for a better one."
2,Fair Product,"I used this product to grind an eye round roast. It was very hard to turn the crank handle and the beef was tough. I cut it up into small pieces,ground it twice, first on course grind, then on fine, as the directions suggested. Maybe all hand grinders are the same. This is the only one I tried."
1,Grinder,This product wasn't working and the handle was broken. I don't recommend to purchase this and it's way to much money for it.
5,Fantastic recipes,I came here looking for another book by Peggy knickerbocker! The recipes in Olive Oil are terrific. You don't have to be an Olive Oil expert to love every single salad or dressing she writes about. Even if you are a three thumbed guy like me you can turn out a five star meal with this book. Thanks Peggy!
5,Great book!,I have loved having this book and have tried some of the recipes! Overall a winner! The recipes I have tried have been simple and delicious. This is a book I will use for a long time!
4,canvas tote garden bag w/tools,The bag is well made as are the tools. My only complaint is that the picture shows a green bag with khaki trim but the bag received was khaki with green trim. When I placed the order there was no color preference indicated. You should show a picture on the website that matches the product or give a color option. I'll keep the bag because it's too much of a hassle to go to the post office to return it.
2,Not for me,"Just like another reviewer, I'm a big Cathe fan and own most of her workouts. This one came as part of the fantastic low impact set. I'm ok with yoga, but it is not my favorite type of exercise. For me it must be interesting or extremely pleasant and well flowing. Going into this workout I was not looking for anything spiritual, just a good routine with some challenge and relaxation. I didn't feel I got that from this. I found it super-boring because it primarily consists of just a few basic moves repeated over and over and over. Additionally, the poses are held extra long which was not challenging for me. Cathe cues well and her form is good (unlike Brenda's, it hurt to look). I didn't find the talking annoying, but the routine just isn't for me."
5,A Masterpiece,"This book is a well-written account of a bizzare episode in banking history. Employing well-researched fact, astute observation of human behavior, and occasional sprinklings of dry humor, Zweig manages to pen a very readable account of the rise and fall of a small bank in Oklahoma. Though criticized by some as being dry in parts, laden with banking jargon foreign to a reader not well-versed in commercial banking, I found it not at all difficult to get the basic ideas of the banking sins committed by those who brought Penn Square to its knees during the early 1980's. Zweig makes up for occasional- but I believe necessary- dryness with brilliantly entertaining accounts of the many people who had a hand in the debacle. All in all, I found it a readable and enjoyable book, and I think that anyone interested in banking or the oil industry would likely agree."
5,The Patchwork Cat,Great book for children. I used to read it to my now grown children and they all still love to talk about it. Got this recently for my g.son. Still a great book for children. The pictures are very good.
3,WANT SOME MORE GOOD HISTORICAL ROMANCE,"I LOVED VALIENT HEART. I LIKE DEFIENT HEART BUT CAPTIVE SOME HOW MISSED ANITA'S USUAL DEFT TOUCH. THIS IS NOT MEANT AS CRITICAL REVIEW. I WOULD LIKE KNOW IF ANITA IS GOING TO GIVE US MORE IN THE SAME TIME LINE WITH THE SAME GOOD SCHOLORSHIP OF VALIENT AND DEFIENT. IT IS HARD TO FIND REALLY GOOD NOVELS USING HISTORY AS THE BACKGROUND FOR ROMANCE. I AM WISHING FOR ANOTHER FROM YOU, ANITA, SOON."
3,"Not As Good As The Previous ""Hearts""","This story was pretty good, though its not as good as Gordon's other Heart novels. It's missing something. The best way I can describe this is a ""lack of richness or fullness"" that the other novels had."
2,Terrible Midrange,"Quite simply, a downward firing midrange is useless. If you pick the satellites up and hold their bottoms towards you, the midrange sounds as it should. Not a good choice in a speaker. What were the engineer's thinking?"
3,horribly tinny,"OK, I'm no audiophile, but these speakers sound pretty awful sitting on my desk at work. If I crank them up, they perform pretty well, and the subwoofer performs admirably at all levels, but I am seriously considering going back to my old ACS295 set--which I only replaced due to a left channel going out). The volume at which I can get away with at work (despite having my own office), is not loud enough to make these enjoyable.Unfortunately, I based my purchase in part on some of the reviews here on Amazon. I would hesitate recommending these speakers to anyone. I think if they had been designed with the satelite woofers pointing out instead of down, they would sound much better--even if they took up more space."
3,"Not bad, but...","Well, I think they're a step up from what I had, a two piece system, but it's not great sound. I'm not an audiophile, so they're fine for me. The biggest problem I have is that there isn't a headphone jack."
3,"OK sound, but there are better ones out there","I got the Altec Lansing ATP3s... at a local computer store and within the same week I also got the Labtec LCS-2422... at a computer show. While the ATP3s sound OK for the price, the Labtecs sound SO MUCH better. Up to mid volume the Altecs sound above average, although kind of dirty. But once you crank the volume up, they just sound horrible.I do like the volume, bass, and treble knobs on the front of the speaker, and these speakers do look nice. If you don't intend to turn them up real loud, and you find a good deal, these speakers are good enough for many people out there. But IMO, there are much better speakers out there for the money."
5,AMAZING SOUND SYSTEM,"I WENT SHOPPING FOR A SOUND SYSTEM FOR MY DESKTOP COMPUTER AND I PURCHASED ONE ON A AUCTION SITE,PLUGGED IT IN AND IT SOUNDED OK BUT I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH IT. I KNEW THERE WAS A BETTER ONE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.SO I WENT TO A POPULAR ELECTRONICS STORE AND HEARD THIS ALTEC-LANSING ATP3 SYSTEM AND WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE SOUND AND QUALITY OF THIS SYSTEM.BUT I STILL DIDN'T BUY IT BECAUSE I KNEW THIS STORE HAVE SELLS ON STUFF LIKE THIS....SO I WAITED AND WAITED.STILL NO SELL PRICE,THEY WANTED $100.00 FOR IT SO I DIDN'T BUY IT.I CAME HOME AND GOT ON MY COMPUTER,WENT TO AMAZON.COM AND PRESTO!.....THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM FOR $73.00 NEEDLESS TO SAY I GOT IT AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE. SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT SYSTEM LOOK NO FURTHER....THIS BEATS THEM ALL!"
4,Good for the Price,"The Altec-Lansing ATP3 speaker set with subwoofer accomplishes what it sets out to do. Setup is a snap between the subwoofer and satellite speakers. The satellite also has the volume control as well as treble and bass controls. As for the sound, the treble and bass control radically effects the quality of the sound with a very small rangefor settings that could be considered ""good"" for sound quality. They take up little space on the desktop and the subwoofer puts out nicely. All in all, a good buy."
3,Great. If you don't pump them too much...,"I loved these speakers for about a year and a half, but the satellites just can't take the heat. The sub is da bomb though. Save yourself some trouble and buy and extra set of satellites for when the first set goes out."
1,Stopped working after ten months of use....,"I loved these speakers until....After about ten months of consistent use, both of the connections (subwoofer to speakes and AC adapter to subwoofer) became loose, and eventually caused the system to fail completely.The connection / signal would fade in and out. I would be forced to jiggle the connections on the subwoofer until the speakers worked - and then, the slightest movement of a speaker wire would cause the speakers to fade out again.At this point, I am unable to get power to the speaker system at all. It is broken and no longer under warranty.I have ordered a pair of JBLs to replace them. Hopefully these will last longer than ten months!"
5,Good Things Come in Small Packages,"The Altec Lansing ATP3 speaker system defies comprehension. First, it represents a tremendous value for the dollar. Secondly, the sound quality is commendable for speakers in this price range. A high level of musicality combining authoritative bass, smooth mid range and treble. The seperate bass and treble controls provided added flexibility in tailoring the sound to the listener's requirements. This system would score high against any system irrespective of price, hats off to Altec for pulling a rabbit out of the hat."
3,"May Not be Reliable, Sound is So-So","These speakers do look cool. But after a few months of normal use, I noticed the sound from the right speaker was dimming. It wasn't the balance control, so I unplugged the speakers and plugged them back in. Now the problem was only in the left speaker. I'm not sure what to make of this, but the speakers seem to be working fine now (a day later).Though casual listeners may not notice, sound quality is only so-so. There is much variation in the frequency response curve for these speakers, with the high (125 Hz) and low (2.5 kHz) values differing by about 14 decibles in my setup. That doesn't include the extremes, where the high and low ends drop off dramatically after about 63 Hz and 10 kHz, respectively. Even with Winamp's 10-band equalizer, I found it impossible to substantially reduce the peak at 125 Hz. And with so much high-end rolloff, don't expect the highs to blow you away."
2,Not as great,"I bought this unit out and returned it, i went up to ATP5 instead, here is what i foundthe bass is weak and the power over all is low, highs is clear but lack of mid-bass which fires downward.i am a bit happier with ATP-5 which is a 5 speakers with much more amp power"
3,"Good for games, so-so for music","I bought these for listening to music and have been disappointed since I first heard them. They make pretty decent game speakers because they handle decent volume without too much distortion, but the sound is too odd for good music speakers. The downward facing midrange speakers make for very uneven sound in the midrange with pronounced peaks around 2kHz (imagine talking into cupped hands). The treble from the 4 drivers is fine; the bass tends towards slight boominess aggravated by a too-high crossover point on the bass control. It seems that the design of these speakers was motivated more by looks than by good sound."
3,Lost left speaker output,"I agree with all the positive things said about the speaker system, but that's when all the components work. I've lost the left channel for no apparent reason that I can think of. They have been in storage for about 4 years and worked fine when stored. When I hooked them into my MacPro there was no left speaker output. Checked all connections and made sure my music source was in stereo. Also I had used a cheaper pair of stereo speakers previous to hooking up the Altecs and they worked fine. Hate to trash the working components but it looks like that is my only choice."
5,10+ years and easily repaired,"Altec-Lansing ATP3 PC speakers' left channel has been intermittently dropping output for over a year. Wiggling one of the connectors restored output until this weekend.A screwdriver, multimeter, soldering iron and an hour later we're `living in stereo' again (apologies to The Cars :)Before you dive in take a look at this user's blog:[...]Apparently modifying the unit makes it sound even better!If you need a `left/right' stereo source head to this site and download the short test mp3:[...]Load into iTunes, set the Controls/Repeat menu to `one', and you'll have a repeating test signal useful for testing stereo separation.Good listening my friends :)"
3,"Nice if you are looking for bass, not vocals...","Let me start off by saying that if you are looking for speakers that are going to produce an amazing amount of bass, then look no further. You have found your speakers. Click on Add to cart and you are good to go. However, if you are looking for well balanced speakers for vocal driven music (i.e. musicals or opera, or even some pop music) then these aren't the best bet. All music sounds good with these speakers -- if you are listening to it loudly. I get up really early and don't want to disturb my wife who likes to sleep a bit later. I found that if I listened to a CD or Mp3 quietly, then the lyrics got lost. If I turn up the volume - an encourage my wife to leave - then everything is fine.All and all, I think these are great spreakers if you are looking to listen to music loudly or music with a lot of bass, otherwise, I would recommend going with something else."
4,Are you miniaturizing again?,"The Good Doctor never felt good about Fantastic Voyage because it wasn't his novel. Here he takes a winning plot and only does average with it. Mildly interesting, but to compared some of his other novels, it just doesn't make the grade"
1,Good idea But,"I tried the Griffin RoadTrip in my Buick Park Avenue. It would only plug into the cigarette lighter so you couldn't see the screen. I got it to work by using an extension cord, but I had to hand hold the plug adaptor (included with the roadtrip) to keep electrical connection. The sound was good, but I couldn't drive and hold the RoadTrip so I returned it. I am still looking for a replacement."
2,Bad sound quality!,"I can say that it works, but the sound it puts out is very disappointing. Thats what I get for only paying 20 bucks."
2,Interference,"First one it's has many interference. Second, connectors are so weak and need a support."
2,Hard to tune,"I bought this product to use on a road trip with a rented car. I was unaware that your car must have a hand tuner so that you can set it on a non-used FM station. The rental car did not have a hand station tuner-so there was no way I could use this on this trip. Also, on this car the power supply was very hard to reach and even with the extension I had some slight trouble. I can use this unit in my own vehicles-so it was not a total loss."
5,RE: Incompatable,"Phillip's review is incorrect. Though I don't personally own a video iPod and thus haven't tried it myself, Apple's site says that this product is compatable with the new Video iPod. Maybe they were just a little slow in updating their site.I've ordered this product myself for my 4th Gen 20gig iPod (non-color). I can't wait to try it out. I've owned the iTrip (another similar Griffin product) for my 2nd Gen iPod in the past and was pleased with it, so this product should be all the better since it has it's own powersource and many other neat-o features."
1,Don't Bother,"This product is an OLD version. The sound quality is very bad. Could not find a channel that didn't have major background ""static"". The volume control was poor. Find another way to hook-up your iPod to your car stereo. We returned for a refund."
2,Do not buy!!!!,This thing is the biggest piece of crap i have ever seen. I hear more static than i do of the songs being played. For it to play clearly i would have to be parked and have my arms folded. Seriously if i moved my arm the thing would go completely to static.I would have returned it but i smashed it into a million pieces. I gave it two stars because it worked sometimes but was still crap! There has to be something better out there. Buyer beware.
3,Not good in NYC,"I tried this for my often commutes from NYC to central NJ. The theory is that you can select a new radio frequency as you move from one zone to another. However, the entire dial seems to be filled up in NYC, so any ""open"" frequency will be surrounded by another ""real"" station, and you are able to find an open one, as you drive, it invariably provides a short window of time before having to try find a new frequency. It just didn't work for me in NYC and immediately surrounding areas. The product it self seems fine, however. But I did end up returning it."
4,Very good for the $$$,"I have three cars (all older and cheapos, but in good shape) and none, obviously, have MP3 players...but now, I can listen to my IPod in all three, thanks to this Griffin Roadmate. It was a great purchase.Sound reproduction was better than I thought it would be....just a tad fuzzy every now and then, but nothing major.I'm older and have no patience for the cr*p on commercial radio, so I just set the IPod on shuffle, and listen to a 3300-plus song library everywhere I go."
5,Save on batteries,"We had been using a Belkin to connect and communicate our Ipod and XM Radio to our cars and boats. The triple A batteries would run out quickly which is a big expense and the connection would be fuzzy without always having strong batteries. The Griffin Transmitter has eliminated all batteries and the expense in addition, we always have a good connection."
4,Not bad,Not too bad after you find a clear station. Did spend a lot of time messing with it to get a clear signal.
4,Road Trip Does The Trick (almost),"This is the second unit I have purchased; I have one for each of my vehicles and one in black and one in white. It is very simple to use and with all the attachments it holds any version of Ipod, I believe. The only negative to this unit and I guess any of the radio transmitter units is the signal change as you are driving. You will have to check for better frequencies as you are moving down the highway. Other than a direct plug in or hardwire to your system this is a good alternative."
4,Great for road trips or just around town,I have one of these so I bought this one for a gift. Shipping was fast and packaging looked great. Easy to find a station and the reception is great. Would recommend.
3,picks up a lot of static,This unit will not play very loud and picks up a lot of static. I tried it on several channels. I will see if it can be returned.
3,Read the Compatibility Specs,"I have an ipod Nano 4th Generation and while this unit allows me to play the ipod through my car radio, it does not charge the unit. My mistake was that I assumed that since the Amazon description showed my ipod and this unit as frequently purchased together that they were compatible...wrong. I have seen reviews for other products with similar comments so the bottom line is always read the detailed specs."
4,Works as expected,"I am happy with this product, it works fine and is relatively easy to use. It is a bit clunky and awkward looking, but works well."
4,It is OK,"A cheap alternative, it works fine except on unsteady roads; you get ocassional static but it is still better than listening to some radio talk shows!Don't expect sound to be perfect at all times, but it really works fine"
3,Variable Results,"The unit does as advertised. One negative is if you live in a large urban area it can be difficult to find a clear frequency, which means you'll hear some distortion while listening.Also, results vary depending on your car's radio. My Maxima's Bose system seems to be slightly off frequency with the unit, which also means a less than pristine sound. Other radios in my friends' cars don't seem to have this problem, and I must say it sounds much better when traveling with them.Overall, I'm still very glad I bought the unit. When traveling, and away from urban areas with lots of competing signals, it sounds great. It's also extremely convenient to have my Ipod powered instead of worrying about remaining battery time."
2,i pod car adaptor,this does not find a station on my radio and it falls out of the cigg light adapter. I tried everything and I bought something else at radio shak but that does not keep the fm channel tuned in either. There is so much static that it interferes with the listening. I have yet to find a product I can listen to my ipod with in the car except just my earphones. Not what i consider safe for car driving
2,"Works as advertised, but ...","Yes it works. You have to blast the radio to get sound out of it though. Note the weight of the transmitter and the ipod is supported by the cig lighter. After my first day with this thing, I can tell that in a couple months the support arm will sag. I opted to return it and buy the kensington fm transmitter that allows you to connect the ipod with a wire and place the ipod on a dash or console."
1,This product made me realize that I can live without my IPOD while driving,"So many pieces come in this package that you'd think ""it HAS to work."" I found that this was not compatible with the dash arrangement of my Honda Odyssey minivan.I'm no technophobe and I can manage instruction manuals, but this was a clumsy, irritating product that I promptly reboxed and returned."
1,very dissapointed,"i had already cta and dlo products and this griffin seemed to be looking nice, but the radio transmitting quality is the worst ever!my dlo was the best it even transmitted on the street to other cars! the griffin doesn't get any sound in in the radio when i move the thing closer to the radio antenna. didn't have time to exchange it so lost money sits in the drawer and waits to be thrown away or passed on..."
1,not worth the money,I didn't not like this at all. It was clunky and got in the way of my gearshift. I returned this product and got a great belkin instead!
3,"Ok, Could have a better reception","This is a multi-function item : The ipod fits great, the package contains multiple adapters to fit different ipods(Nano,Photo...). The charger works great, it charges the ipod while transmitting music. The Package also contains some adapters to fit almost any position you could want in the car. The only downside for me is that the reception through the FM band is not too great, in fact I think that the transmission is poor, compared to the sound of a radio station, it lacks of performance."
1,Buyer beware!!!,"I have tried both the Griffin Road Trip and the Belkin Tunebase with my iPod Classic, and found both products to be worthless. I don't live in a major metropolitan area, though it's still hard to find an empty space on the dial without a strong signal on either side of it. Nonetheless, trying every available spot on the dial resulted in occasional success, only to be compromised with unacceptable amounts of static a block away. I have an '03 VW Passat, and perhaps the radio is more shielded than others. Bottom line: it's an expensive gamble!"
4,Pretty Decent for your Ipod & car,"I received a Transpod for Christmas and had a hard and frustrating time finding a station that would broadcast with minimal static and in the end, I could not find one with the Transpod. As an experiment, I tried my husband's Roadtrip and absolutely loved it. It was night and day compared to the two FM transmitters. That same day, I exchanged the Transpod for the Roadtrip and have loved it ever since!"
3,it's OK,"This road trip works pretty well for the most part. The fact that it is mounted by plugging into the lighter (accessory) outlet is the main problem. Even on a smooth road, it does come loose on and even fall out of the outlet. This gets a little iritating. The reception is good once you find a empty station. This is a good deal for the money but I will buy a direct connect to my receiver in the future."
4,Griffin Road Trip,"I bought this to replace one for my son-in-law (part of his first one was stolen with his iPod a year ago). Currently, our family boasts 4 iPods and 4 Road Trips. I use mine daily - next to an iPod-ready stereo (next car!)this is the best way to listen to my iPod while driving. There are some occasional issues with static occasionally, but overall I am very happy with the Road Trip I have purchased."
1,Terrible sound,"The sound is very muffled and lacks dynamic range. I also had to turn the volume WAY up on the radio in order to even hear it. I tried in my Nissan Maxima, Dodge Ram, and home stereo and had the same problems in all cases. The sound was so bad that I couldn't stand to listen to it. Maybe all FM transmitters are this way. If that's the case then buy a wired hookup, or spend your money on a new car stereo that is iPod compatible."
4,Perfect for Car,"Works great for the car, should fit any outlet configuration since it has the capability of bending so many ways. Very intuitive, good signal. Doesn't come with cradle for the new nano, but has a foam pad to adjust the normal ipod cradle to fit."
2,Didn't work in Los Angeles in my Camry,"While I read great reviews of this item and had great hopes, it didn't work in Los Angeles in our car. The company was great and retested and resent the item, but it was not able to hold the available frequencies in the area. I spoke to a guy at a car radio place and he said it wasn't the item, but the area and how crowded the airwaves were. Great company to work with."
1,Save your money,"Unless you live in the middle on a cornfield don't buy this or any other wireless FM transmitter for that matter, because they don't work. Even when the signal is supposedly clear you have to crank the volume up as loud as it will go and the sound quality is completely subpar. The cradle looks pretty good and assimilates with your dash great - too bad it doesn't work worth a damn. I care entirely too much about my music collection to tolerate such an inferior product. A $9.99 cassette adapter sounds 20x better than the best signal this supposedly top-of-the-line transmitter can give you in a midsize city."
1,Piece of Junk!,"This product does not transmit over the radio to any standard that I expected. I have to turn my volume 60% up to even hear that it is playing. I had a similar product from this company for an earlier model of the IPOD and it worked great. I ordered this to replace my old one and to use with my new IPOD G3. What a mistake, it is not powerfull enought to overpower other stations and I get scratchy signal all the time even with the volume up 60%. Save your money, look at other options and companies out there."
3,Road Trip Reviewed,"Well I just have to say that I absolutely love this thing, however, I had alot of trouble with it when I first got it. One problem was that the extension that came with it wasn't wired together right so I had to break it a part and solder it back together. That got the extension working but when I finally got it positioned where I wanted it, it would swing around when I turned sharply in my vehicle so I quit using the extension. I also have a problem with the thing popping out of the cigarette lighter port when I hit a big bump or something. It charges the Ipod, which I love but this thing does have some cons but the pros still outweigh them, at least for me. Good Product."
3,"good, but watch out if it breaks","I am a bit miffed because I bought this in early January and the very bottom pieces that fit into the car socket have already self destructed. My roadtrip does not work now. The bottom piece melted a bit around the spring and the bottom piece won't screw in properly.I am hoping that RadioShack will have some parts to fix it with.Anyway, I am not so happy with this thing now. It was expensive and we deserve better quality for the money!!!!!Griffin does not offer good support. You are basically on your own if something happens to it. Buy some cheap components to rig up the same functions instead (tape deck thing, separate charger, etc). At least when a part breaks you can go replace it easily."
4,fine item,"Did exactly what it said on the box - the only criticisms are that the instructions don't tell you what it means if the light on the side is green or red, and that the set up is easier for a left-hand drive car (as you would expect) although it is flexible enough that it doesn't really matter - apart from that, excellent!"
1,Blew out my stereo system!,"I purchased this second hand, and I put it in the cigarette lighter. As soon as I did, my entire stereo blew out and I had to go to the dealership to fix it. I think I'd rather have the cassette stereo hooked to the iPod because its much less damage and plays better than trying to find a dang station in the middle of a huge metropolis."
1,Expensive JUNK,"This thing is awful. Sounds like garbage!!! I returned mine the very next day. Just plain awful!! How anyone could listen to this is beyond me. Direct plug-in is the only way to go.The only way I would recommend this is if it were FREE or under $10. Seriously, this thing is junk. You'd be better off buying a Thigh-Master because at least that has a picture of that blond from Three's Company."
1,incompatible,according to your review the griffin roadtrip fit all ipods. According to apple it does not fit the new video models. Please clarify. rsvp
4,Very good,"I bought this product here on Amazon at an EXTREME discount. It worked exactly as advertised right out of the box. Just plugged it in and it worked flawlessly. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the audio range. While I can easily hear it and most people wouldn't listen to music that loud, my car radio volume control was about 70% to really get the full experience. With CD or other FM, I keep it about 45-50%, so this curious drop in volume puzzles me... But, who am I kidding. For what I paid, this is an excellent investment. I'm taking a ""road trip"" of my own and won't have to pack CD's. This product was well worth buying."
3,its ok,"when i got it, the fuze was broken... and its kinda staticy, no matter which station i put it on.."
4,Griffin RoadTrip FM Transmitter,I love this product! It works really well and comes with so much stuff. It came in really good condition and has instructions and exchangeable parts.
5,Griffin RoadTrip,"This works great in my yukon, it puts it within easy reach of your hands and it plays very nicely through my bose sound system. I highly recommend this unit."
2,Road Trip FM,A friend purchased the itrip it is alot better than this product. Too much static and doesn't transmit well. I would spend extra and get an itrip.
3,A tale of two fm transmitters,My friend has one of these and it works wonderful for her. I tried hers out in my car and it worked great too so I ordered the same model from amazon.Unfortunately this one didn't work for me. Lots of static no matter what frequency I tried and it would shut off after a few minutes so I returned it.I'm thinking it was the specific unit that was bad and not the product as a whole which is why I'm giving it 3 stars rather than 1.Fortunately Amazon is great with returns and took it right back for me.
2,Bad sound quality,"After having read all of the reviews for this item I was really excited to receive it from the seller. My car does not have a cd player so this was my one last chance at listening to good music in the car besides paying over 100 dollars to get something profesionally installed. I tried so many different fuzzy stations like it said in the directions and only one somewhat worked. The sound quality was poor at best and often I just found it too annoying to even bother listening. If I could go back in time, I would buy something a little more expensive that you are positive has good sound quality in your car. Try going to a best buy first and getting advice and then come to get it online."
1,Absolute disappointment!,"I absolutely regret ever purshased this item!The FM transmitter doesn't work in any FM station, the static is even worse when using the ipod! The static is pretty strong, you can barely hear any music! I strongly recommend you not to purchase this item. It is total garbage!I am furious because I cannot listen to my ipod while driving!"
2,Very poor sound quality!,"Great design, but the sound quality of this unit is very poor! It is almost impossible to find an FM station that is clear enough to even be able to stand listening to your iPod with this unit. Spend a few more dollars and have your vehicle hard wired for your iPod!"
2,Okay in countryside,"If there are strong radio signals changing rapidly, it cuts out, which is a hassle. If you're patient, it's a good buy."
1,Griffin RoadTrip FM Transmitter and Car Charger for iPod (Black),I bought a Griffin RoadTrip and the FM transmitter wasn't working. One week later the charger stopped working. I tried to get in touch with Griffin and they never gave me a response. I received a credit from Amazon. I would not recommend the RoadTrip to anybody.
5,Highly recommend,"I highly recommend this product. I have a 5th generation iPod and an 04 Hyundai Sante Fe - this product works beautifully with both. I haven't had one problem. I'm in Pittsburgh, PA - I didn't have any trouble finding a useful fm setting either. It was easy to install/connect initially (I didn't need the extension arm that is included with it) working seamlessly with the factory-stereo. I had a slight humming noise with the first station I tried, but then I moved up the dial a bit and it's worked smoothly ever since. This is the only fm transmitter I've tried, but I'm extremely happy with it and would recommend it to anyone. And as I have been for several years, I'm a happy satisfied customer of Amazon as well."
2,lots of problems,I received this as a gift. I didnt do the research the wife did. I used it maybe 1 week. When I first used it I thought the device with the ipod plugged in was too bulky and blocked some of the heat/ac controls in my truck. There was alot of interference from engine noise (a high pitched whine that got worse with speed). In 1 weeks time I went thru 3 different 7.5 amp fuses in my Nissan Frontier. Just before the fuse would blow the engine noise interference got really bad. I emailed tech support with the problem but they never answered. Its ok because I had decided to return it at this point anyway. I seem to be in the minority with my experience but I was not happy with the product.
4,Does the job.,"I've had no problems that other previous reviewers have had in the transmitter extention from the lighter outlet ""slipping"" and moving around. I've had absolutley NO issue with that. The extension is great because this allows my ipod to be at a level where it is SAFE to use when you are driving. No looking down to mess around with the ipod. I have it located just right of the steering wheel.The sound quality that I get with the transmitter is okay. I do get some static in certain areas. However, this being a FM transmitter, it's a given that if you are in a populated area, the airwaves are going to be populated, therefore giving you the interference of static. If you dont mind the slight decrease in quality of sound, then go get this item. It wont give you the CD quality sound that headphones or the stereo will give you obviously, but you shouldnt be driving with headphones anyway (like some people do):-) It does the job in functionality and ease of use."
4,Works great,"Got this for my wife because she recently got an iPod Nano. My only complaint is that, as the ad says, it DOES work with the 2G Nano model, but you have to order an adapter from the manufacturer. The adapter is free, but the postage is around $8. Seems like a lot of $$ for shipping a cheap little plastic adapter."
2,Fell apart after 2 weeks.,"Sound quality was ok, but the lighter adapter tore apart the connector wires when I pulled it out of the cigarette lighter after 2 weeks. Plus the screw that holds the adapter pieces together just fell out. Not too pleased."
4,Griffin Road Trip,"Great item for the money. Works very well, fits nicely with the extension pieces, it can easily be moved around. It has good sound quality when you find the right station for your area. Long trips may require finding another station. Keeps your IPOD charged. Easy too operate. I LIKE IT!!!"
3,its pretty cool,I like this transmitter/charger. The sound is great. The only problem is that the base thing is kinda bulky and got in the way of my windshield wiper stick thing on my steering collumn.
3,Excellent for your iPod but...,"This transmitter is OK but does not have real great high and low frequency response. I live in the high desert north of Los Angeles and there are 4 or 5 frequencies I found to tune to that have no radio broadcast on them. Even with a clear FM channel the high and low frequency response is distorted when the volume on my 2002 Accord is turned up more than half way. Since I got a new vehicle with a direct connection via 1.5mm cord to the stereo system, I have no distortion even at full volume. This product is a good but not great solution to using your iPod in your vehicle if you do not have a direct connection."
3,ipod through the radio,"it's ok, a loss of fidelity was expected. but the other catch is that if the recorded volume was low, it wont turn up any higher. overall, it's nice to have all my tunes in the car. don't expect miracles and you wont be disappointed. i drove 1oo plus miles and never had to change the frequency. that was cool. from sacramento to fremont. 98.7 FM"
2,Griffin Technology 4031-RDGC RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger and Cradle for iPo,"this is just ok, it is big and bulky and if your cigarette lighter is loose(like most cars) it will never stand up straight. takes a while to start, I got the itrip and it is much better"
1,"Save your money, buy an iHome instead","We bought this in anticipation of a road trip. My husband can not use it in his car because he gets too much static. We figured that we would be ok in our newer family car, but, I got so annoyed trying to find a station that it could work on driving through towns and down the highway, plus all of the static, that we ended up stopping and buying a $20 1Home to complete the trip. It worked great. I was very disappointed with this product."
2,Not for city use,I am from the Philadelphia area and do not have a FM station without some interference. When using the best station I can find for use with the transmitter makes my ipod come in like a bad radio station.
4,Great value,"I was apprehensive when I got it for about $15, but the item arrived in perfect condition with all its accessories and work great. Quite a steal, really!"
5,griffin road trip radio FM transmitter and car charger,"good product, works just fineGriffin RoadTrip FM Transmitter and Car Charger for iPod (Dark Gray)"
3,Not for 4th generation i-pod,Ordered this thinking it would work with 4th gen ipod. It would play through the radio but would not charge the battery. Seller gave me a prompt refund.
4,Great product Great sound,This product has a great sound it is the best of the Ipod chargers/fm tuners that I have ever used. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is bulky and when I attach it to my car lighter it bumps into things including my leg when I'm driving. I also can't let other people change the songs on my Ipod because of this. I still think this is worth the money that you would pay to get one I would recommend it.
1,Silly piece of junk,"No matter what station you put this thing on, you will get static. I live in an area where there are about 8 radio stations, so its definitely not interference. That static will be magnified because you have to turn your radio up considerably to hear your music. With ""smart sound"" turned on the transmission will get slightly louder (though still not even close to loud enough) but the volume will fade up and down throughout a song and vary greatly between different songs.After 2 days with this thing I finally broke down and bought the wiring needed to create an AUX port in my car and this device is now just my iPod charger - which it is great at, by the way. The flexible mount is great and my iPod stays nice and snug in the cradle."
2,very disappointed,Bought this item because it provided desired functionality of both a charger as well as transmitter for I-pod. After multiple attempts I kept getting error message stating this device does not provide charging function. Obviously either this was a manufacturing defect or it did not actually include the charger function. Either way I was very disappointed and returned item.
2,Bah,"I got this for my mother as a christmas gift, and when I went to hook it up all I could hear was static and a little of the music. After fiddleing around for a bit I finally got it to work, but about 5 minutes into driving the thing just stops working, I checked and made sure it wasnt the outlet that was the issue and made sure it was in 100%. It just stops playing after 2-5 minutes.For the cost it's acceptable, but the performance is down right wretched. I only got this because the one I wanted to get her wasn't in stock, so now it's past the return date so I'm just going to throw this one into the junk pile and wait for the other one to get in stock."
1,"First one was crap, 2nd one was not what I wanted","I ordered the 1st one and it didn't work, they sent out a replacement and it was not the model I wanted. I only wanted this as a charger & holder since it was for a late model car that has an aux port."
3,a little fuzzy but works well,"works nicely in rural areas, but can be hard to find a clear station in the city. definitely a nice alternative when you can't connect your i-pod directly to the stereo"
3,Good . . . . but,"I wish I had looked at more options. This unit can be quite cumbersome sitting right next to the gearstick in my wifes car. It works great, however, I wish it had a setting to automatically come on when it senses power; I've forgotten how many times I have messed with my radio or ipod only to realize that the unit has not switched on. Also, I have had numerous scrapes on my knuckles when shifting the car into park.I have seen smaller models which seem like they do the job just as good."
5,i pod player for auto,I am very happy with the products and services I have purchased through amazon and will continue to show my support for them.The product works very well and it is coming in very usefulthanks
3,Constant Static Overlay,"With this product I finally decided to just get a new deck that I can directly connect my MP3 player to. The constant static hiss laying over my music no matter what radio station I picked just proved too much. This is a problem with all products of this nature, regardless of price, brand, or over-all value. From what I hear, a few years back the things actually sounded good but due to instances of travellers getting other people's music beamed into their cars, manufacturers were forced to lower the power on these products. It's not worth it . . . get a new deck, or, if you're lucky enough to still have a cassette tape layer just buy yourself one of those tape thing-a-ma-jiggies what plugs straight into the headphone jack and goes in the tape-hole. Never thought I'd write that . . . tape-hole."
3,Not what I expected.,"The item is okay but has problems. The Griffin Roadtrip provides holders for each modle of i pod. It worked great with the ipod classic 3rd generation. The i pod nano 5th generation I just bought it does not work well with though. The adapter would not slide in the griffin roadtrip properly and cracked when I gave it some force. With both of these I pods I got an error message saying that the Griffin Roadtrip could not charge the equipment because they were not compatable. That is a drag. The reception is okay depending on where I am traveling. I would not recommend buying it through this seller. I had only 7 days to return it if I did not like it but I ordered the I pod nano at the same time and it did not arrive for 2 weeks. So, to conclude, the equipment is only okay but cracked when assembling it and does not charge my equipment as I expected it to."
1,Doesn't work in Infiniti,"Was very hopeful about this product to use with my iPod Nano (4G), but very disappointed. My CD player broke in my car (stuck CDs), and I bought this as a cheaper alternative to replacing the car's system. However, the unit will not even power on in my 2003 Infiniti G35. Another reviewer briefly mentioned that it wouldn't work in his Infiniti either, but I had chalked it up to being a fluke. Not so. Not compatible at all.It did work in my husband's Ford Explorer, but the sound quality was so bad it is unusable, even on a clear radio frequency. I had expected it to be the same quality as listening to an FM radio, but it was far, far worse. Even with the volume cranked as high as it could go on both the radio and the iPod, I could just barely hear it, and it certainly wasn't enjoyable. Changing radio stations didn't work either.I would not recommend this product."
1,Doesn't work,"After having my old $17.95 charger transmitter stolen from my car I replaced with this one. It was lost in transit, finally when it turned up, plugged it in with my IPOD touch and the screen said charging not supported on this accessary. Grrr had just returned another one that didn't charge. Nothing on the web page or booklet in the box says anything about not being charge compatible with some models. Why would anyone buy a car Ipod player without a charger? Also get a whurring sound when going through the gears coming through the speakers. Volume is low as well. So over buying on the net. Would rather touch feel smell so you get what you pay for."
1,Broken,"I used it only for 2hours or so while driving and after a while, the green light was gone. No matter what I did, the power indicater was not turned on. I am not sure if it was broken while driving and it was too late to returned this product. Sorry it is only one star. If it was working fine, I would have given 4 stars."
5,fits my iPod just fine,I've talked to many people who have different adapters for their cars and I've come to realize that this is the best. It's a tad bit bulky but I would rather have something that's bulky and works great and is realiable.
3,RoadTrip This . . .,"The Roadtrip is a quality product that functions as one would expect for the price. Knowing that ipod to tape player units certainly have better consistency, fidelity, and longevity...I choose the roadtrip anyway. Check it out . . .1) It charge the iPod . . . which means it can play forever!2) It's powerful enough to overpower most non-major radiostations3) Digital display makes sure you know exactly where to tune4) You can change the freuency to any imaginable recievable FM frequencythe bad . . .1) It needs your car A/C adapter to function and/or be hooked through your computer's USB port . . . so no using this bad boy on the job with the boom box etc.2) It's definitely an addition to audio system in your car in terms of size... it kind of looks like an alien arm extending out of the console.3) You can't put a gel cover on your ipod because then it doesn't fit in the bracket which holds the ipod in place. Major bummer."
3,Griffin Technology 4031-RDGC RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger,"This was easy to install and use, and I had no problem finding a station to transmit to. However, I did have two issues. first the low position of the Griffin sometimes limits its transmission. If I could move it around a bit I would get perfect reception, but since it is stationary I receive good reception which in all honesty isn't half bad. The other issue is the fit of the iPod into the cradle. It is designed to fit the iPod snuggly into the cradle, however I bought an iSkin to protect my iPod and I have not been able to use it because the iPod doesn't fit in the cradle in its skin. I could take off the skin (which I did) when using the Griffin transmitter, however it is a combersom process to put it on and off, so I decided to buy a differenct type of protective cover where the iPod can be removed easily."
4,A great way to listen to your Ipod in your car,"The RoadTrip FM transmitter will charge your Ipod and allow you to listen to your Ipod over your car speakers using the radio. First you need to find a station that is only static, click a button, and presto, your're in business. The cradle has an extension piece that plugs into your cigarette lighter. It can swivel in several directions, so you can adjust it so it won't interfere with your stick shift or radio buttons. A very well designed product."
3,"Worked fine, until . . .","Three days after the warranty expired, the RoadTrip started shorting out the 12V (cigarette lighter) outlet in my car. I replaced the fuse three times in one day before I figured out that the RoadTrip was the culprit (as opposed to phone charger, etc.). Other than that, it worked fine for me for a year. You have to understand the limitations, though. Don't expect CD quality sound, because you're not going to get it for this kind of money."
4,Good product and essential for long trips,"SO far this has been an ideal product for transmitting on FM signals during long car rides. The only fault I find with the gadget is that on heavier models of Ipod (I have the 20GB) the holder tends to ""slip"" a bit in the lighter jack. I'm sure it works great with some of the smaller ipods and stays where you want it. Other than that an excellent product at an excellent price. Delivered well before I expected it."
3,Wish I could return it,"I had an older version of the roadtrip from Radio Shack and it worked better. This version was $30 cheaper from Amazon but I have some trouble finding a clear station. I need someone riding with me just to be able find a clear station while I drive.It's also not handy at all to remove/replace your ipod into. After finding out that my video ipod has a hard drive and should not be left in my car (in heat, cold, dampness), I remove it when I will be out of the car for a significant amount of time and it's a pain. I wish I would have gotten a transmitter/charger without a stand now--also could have used my leather case with that kind of transmitter, can't with one on a stand."
5,Excellent Peice of equipment,"This is my 2nd transmitter/charger unit, the first was a Belkin. This Unit is far superior, holds the Ipod better, has more options for positioning the unit, more frequency's for reception, and transmits a very strong signal. I had it playing in one of my vehicles in the driveway whilst I moved my other vehicle out to the street, and the reception in the 2nd vehicle was excellent from 25-40 feet away. I will probaly buy another."
3,"not the best product, but expected performance of a transmitter","I drive a stick shift and my cigarette lighter is next to it, so when I plug in the unit, it blocks my shifting to 5th gear. It is also not very clear in the radio...it sounds muffled. I regret getting it."
5,Griffin Roadtrip for iPod Nano,"I haven't had any problems with it so far. It has performed great.NOTE: After you set it to a selected radio station, if you have a Nano, be sure to 'restart' the Nano by holding the Menu button and the Center button at the same time or you won't get any sound out of it. This resets the device. I didn't have this information at first so I thought it wouldn't work with a Nano. But resetting the Nano confirmed that it does indeed work.The description of the Roadtrip doesn't say it works with the Nano, but it has a Nano adapter and everything works fine."
3,New model I think,"I used my new roadtrip on a 500mi round trip. Having the iPod charged was great. Wile I don't know the numbers the transmitter is more powerful than the other 2 I have used. The thing I really don't like is it isn't the same as the pics shown. I think it's a little smaller witch is good, but the 90 that most pics on the web show on the extencion is made on the back of the RoadTrip making it much harder to position so you can see the screen if you have to use the extension. (Extension needed for 96 GMC Yukon & 05 Ford F250)"
3,Good Idea bad device,"This car IPOD dock is a great idea, however it pickup too much interference from other devices. It is great for road trips but if you are an audiofile this is a nightmare!"
3,Jury is still out,I have had this for over one month. This may be an upgrade for people converting off a standard pillow but I have had trouble adjusting off a chiropractic foam pillow. The neck support is not what I am used to and I find that I need to pull the pillow into my neck to get adequate support.
4,So far so good!,"I just started using this product yesterday and so far I have had no urge to over eat, I look at junk food and I don't have any urge to eat it and I actually feel like exercising! I've only used it twice so far but I do feel as though it's working!"
2,Bad production quality,"I downloaded this album specifically because another reviewer praised its quality. I guess he/she wasn't referring to production quality because this recording is horrible in that regard. Everytime Greg Simmons makes the ""S"" sound, it comes out in a whistling, grating manner similar to that kid professing to only want his two front teeth for Christmas. Worse, the audio level for the voice track gets noticeably lower over the course of the recording to the point where you really can't understand what's being said (you just hear ""mumble-mumble-SSS-mumble-SSSS-mumble-mumble-SSS-mumble"", etc.). Unfortunately, the point at which it starts becoming inaudible is right were the relaxation part ends and the weight loss suggestions begin. So frustrating. Doesn't anyone make quality recordings in this arena? Greg Simmons, get yourself a new sound engineer!"
2,Its a ok item,I bought this item for myself for mother's day and when I got it I was disapointed. The item is very small. But it is pretty in a way.
1,NOT a real first-hand account,"Please note:This book has been proven to be a fake, insofar as the so-called 'diary' is actually based on a short story written in 1895. See Jim Jackson, 'Famine Diary: The Making of a Best Seller,' Irish Review no. 11 (Winter 1991-2), p. 1-8. While some of the historical conditions is describes may be accurate, it should not in any case be read as an 'authentic' first hand account."
1,Memorex 32MB CF intermittent,"I've used this in two Kodak cameras and various MP3 players, all have had frequent problems reading/writing to this card. I've sent it in to Memorex for a replacement and found the new unit with identical problems. Memorex still does not admit to there being any problem with their cards. Do not get this card!Amazingly enough, I got frustrated enough to find a workaround when the CF fails to read. Simply remove it from your device for anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes, then reinstall it and see if you can now retrieve your data. Nine out of 10 times this works for me. Apparently, having it sitting idle with no power attached seems to temporarily resolve the problem. I've used it for a year like this and have always been able to play my MP3s...after a few minutes of waiting. Your mileage may vary.Again, DO NOT GET THIS CARD!"
2,Unreal....,"It broke in at the joint on the second use. Called and was passed from person to person. Next day, the same thing. So here I am, stuck with a piece of junk! I will be staying away from Poulan. They used to have good chainsaw's as well, not having luck with their new lines in those products either. I'll be switching brands for good."
1,"waste of money,junk","I bought this new. I took it out of the box, assembled it, then started it. But now the trimmer does not spin. Never wored once ! I have taken it to a repair shop and have been waiting 2 weeks. They have to order parts. I had to pay $31.80 for them to look at it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I will say that it did start up nice."
1,P{oulan Gas Trimmer,"I bought the PPB300E Poulan Pro gas trimmer at Wal Mart for about the same price. This is a pretty good gas trimmer BUT it is almost impossible to find replacement trimmer lines for it. It takes .115 pre cut line. No one, not even the Poulan dealers, have the .115 stuff here in Texas. I had to contact Poulan and they told me that .115 line is discontinued... but they were able to find me a couple of packages of the stuff.If I had to do it again I'd buy a more common unit NOT the Poulan Pro series.Nick C"
4,Cooking with Fernet Branca is a tasty bit of fluff,"I bought it simply because I liked the title, and was pleased by a highly amusing read. I recommend that readers have a bottle of Fernet handy, as you'll want to sip it as you read this delightful little novel. But try the various exotic Fernet-based recipes at your own risk!"
2,I can't believe I paid money for this !,"Just like I said in my review title, I can't believe I paid money for this. It was a total impulse purchase at Barnes and Noble. It wasn't the most horrible thing I have ever read but I really wouldn't bother with it again if I had a chance to do it all over again. Not really my cup of tea. I wasn't at all familiar with this author's other books but, after reading this one, I probably won't read anything else by him."
2,I didn't really like this book.,I didn't like it and didn't finish it. It had an odd sense of humor that really didn't appeal to me. I wish I had gotten it from the library rather than spending money on it.
4,"Forget the recipes, just read the book!!","Readers accustomed to those travel stories whereby foreigners fall in love with a tumbledown old house in France or Italy and then lovingly restore it with the help of a bunch of well meaning but unreliable locals will love this new novel.Essentially a satire on the travel memoir genre, 'Cooking' is the story of Gerald and Marta, a pair of ill matched neighbours who live in a tiny village in the Tuscan hills. He is a English snob who ghostwrites for a living and cooks implausible recipes (thoughtfully included, but not recommended!!) as a vocation. Marta is an East European composer of film scores.The story is told be each of the characters in turn (each in the first person) as their lives become increasingly and reluctantly intertwined.You will guess the ending long before it arrives, but it won't matter at all. You'll be laughing too hard to care!Beautifully written and highly recommended."
5,"Most hilarious, gorgeously written book I have ever read","I don't know about the serious work of James Hamilton-Paterson, but this totally entertaining book is gorgeously written, with such a lavish attention to the craft of writing that some people might think he wasted staggering amounts of talent on fluff. But there's the mark of a fantastic writer -- he obviously has staggering amounts of talent to waste. Eloquently crafted, paragraph after paragraph, so entertaining and so beautifully written you are moved to tears of laughter and nearly speechless appreciation for the gift of what you're reading. The description of Alien Pie and the ultimate experience of its consumption must be the high point of the book, although I haven't finished it yet, so there could be something even better in store."
1,Staying Connected,"If there were a choice for no stars that would be it. I purchased this Hp and from the get go was dissapointed. If you want to do multiple sheets of printing good luck. This is where the problems starts, once you get your project going you will start to loose connection with the PC. And believe me this will be on going loosing time reconnecting and also loosing money on waisted photo sheets which were haulted in the middle of printing. There have been no solutions from HP in fact they discontinued this HP due to the enormous problems which were the same for everyone. Rather than fix the problem they simply discontinued the brand. If you think you won't have problems look up this type of HP on message boards and feast your eyes on all the people frustrated with the same problem. C'mon HP own up to the problem and give people there money back or at the least a free Canon."
1,HP 1215 Photo Printer,Very difficult to use. Editing pictures difficult. Using also a regular printer means programming before every new page. The printer gives you duplicate pictures. There must be something better by this company.
2,HP is this as good as it gets,"I purchased this printer for the IR capability. I have been very please with this aspect of the printer. After 3 hrs of tring to print some photo's Only the first two prints turned out. paper jam's, interrupted printing, poor color quality ""ompared with first printing of same photo. I must say I expected alot more for my $, and alot more from HP products. signed, Very dismayed"
3,Photo quality just like the Epson printer,"I have to be honest with you. After using my Epson 700 Photo printer for about 1 year for printing photos I had high expectations of any printer costing more. This printer was easy to install, had 3 CD's for every desktop. It's very quiet. I almost can't hear it print and it's fast as long as you don't print photo's, using 2400 by 1200 dots per inch. Then it's slow but it's still faster than my Epson. However the print quality is not much better and in fact I can't even tell the difference which printer the photo came from. So when you make decision about buying, keep that in mind, and if the speed is of essence you won't see it. I bought it specifically for speed. So here is the reason for 3 stars. This is a good printer, not a great one for the money I paid I expected a great printer."
4,5 stars with a different OS?,"It may deserve 5 stars. It does a VERY good job with text and with photos, but.... Using it with MS ME, sometimes OS can't find the printer, AFTER you've set it all up and clicked the print button. I tend to believe this is not the printer's fault."
1,WORST PRINTER FOR THE MONEY,"this printer does everything EXCEPT print! 2 months after i bought it, when i could even get it to print, pices of plastic and springs would fall out! it cost me money with wasted photo paper, it cost me money calling tech support. it cost me money on internet postage it [messed] up! i can't believe i paid ...fo this thing. as we speak i am in the middle of a biG hassle with HP trying to get my money back. you'd be much better off, for the money, to get a separate photo printing machine ... and a normal printer .... WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! (OBVIOUSLY :) )"
2,Not something to buy sight unseen,"I bought this handle to restore a 50's era Kelly axe head. The grain was aligned perpendicular to the axis of the head, instead of parallel as it should have been. There was a good bit of heartwood in fhe handle, the notch for the wedge was cut slightly on an angle and the wedge itself was not tapered gradually enough. It split in two places during installation. The handle itself was either slightly warped, or just shaped improperly because although the head was aligned with the handle for two thirds of the length, the fawns foot at the end appears twisted out of alignment.On the other hand, the head is mounted now and it is at least as good as the average cheap hardware store axe."
5,Our God is One!,"This is an excellent book explaining the Oneness of God. I learned a lot by reading it. Thoroughly shows the Truth of God's Word that He is one and not three.To the ones who hate others because of their beliefs, shame on you. That's not at all a Christian attitude to have. Love one another in spite of differences.God bless."
5,"IN THE WORDS OF JESUS "" THY WORD IS TRUTH""","IT IS AWESOME TO READ A BOOK NOT INFALLIBLE BUT VERY CREDIBLE. ""THE ONENESS OF GOD"" HITS THE MARK IN A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW THEIR GOD. I DID ENJOY THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT SHOWED SCRIPTURALLY THE DOCTRINE OF WHO GOD IS. THANKS BROTHER BERNARD FOR AWESOME INSIGHT, MORE IMPORTANTLY THANKS BE TO MY LORD AND MY GOD, JESUS CHRIST..."
3,It's okay,"I really got this album for that Eric Roberson song (""I Dare U to Stay"") and, just as I feared, that's the only great song on here. This is just another one of those generic neo-soul albums with all these people you never heard of and probably won't hear from again. Oh yeah, what's up with that ""Nursery Rhymes"" song? Kinda corny."
1,DAMSEL?,"I have come across 2 other bands with the name DAMSEL and thats only where I live, here in Tulsa! REALLY ORIGINAL LADIES. Anyways, Is this CD a JOKE or are these girls serious. The beats areweak, the vocal are forced and the guitars are.. well, not there. What I mean to say is that they are really bad :( I wish them well.. by that I mean "" Would fall in a well "". The song titles are LAME, the vocals are MONO-TONE.. I can't begin to get into it all. on a scale of 1-100 I would give them a 10 ( thats scoring HIGH )"
1,"Come back later, they're not done yet!","Lets see.. there are so many reasons NOT to buy this cd.. I'll give you all 5 of them. 5)Terrible editing... 4) Monotone vocals... 3)Drums sound like they're using garbage cans... 2)Guitar work is Ultra sloppy and very ""BAD DISCO"" 70's style and the #1 reason...1) Arent these supposed to be girls?? Looks more like guys in drag ""unless I'm missing the joke"" Save your dough."
1,Try some other Time...,"When I first heard about Damsel I was happy to hear that another Female band was out there doing their thing. I had a chance to listen to the Cd""Time"" and what a disappointment it was. First of all the Vocals have no range, very monotone (she sounds like she can sing but not quite). The music is not tight, the Guitar playing is off, there is no musical leads or smooth melodies to entice us to want to hear more. They have nice melodies but they don't sound right according to how they are played. These girls are not musically talented to make it out there. Nice try but next time make it worth while.."
1,nice try but bad,This album had lots of promise at least i originally thought. It started off rocking but towards the end it just sounded as if it was stale and old.The songs had a tendecy to all sound the same and unoriginal. I will hope that for a next album they try to stay away from kitty-like riffs and try somthing new. There is always room for new girl bands..but they have to sound new
5,Don't forget to buy a printer cable,"Great printer-- fast and very quiet. Installation was simple, and the ""getting started"" overview was sufficient to avoid reading any manuals at all. Try HP's high-end photo paper at least once if you print digitial photographs-- the automatic paper sensing makes this as simple as just loading the paper in the tray.Remember to buy a USB or parallel printer cable-- that's the one thing they didn't include in the box."
5,excellent printer good job HP,excellent infared tech super fast.. a great printer I am a previous owner of a 970cxi this is a much better unit.
4,It works,"Good quality stethoscope, comfortable. Have had no issues with it whatsoever. I use it on a daily basis to check blood pressure and no problems thus far."
5,Comfortable and well made,This is one stethoscope that you can wear all day and it appears as if it is going to last for sometime. I may actually get my monies worth this time.
2,damaged,"I bought this as a replacement for my old one, which I use to assess my kids' asthma and check for lung infections. The clarity of sound is good, but the one I received has bent binaurals. It isn't just that they rotate- the ear tubes are actually bent.I should have returned it, but I have UC and was in a flare and just couldn't get to it. Completely my fault, and I realize it isn't even close to the most expensive stethoscope made, but it seems quality control should have caught it because it's visibly just wrong.Luckily, I don't need it for work, so the discomfort of use is bearable due to the fact that I don't use it a lot.Just a bit disappointed at QC of the manufacturer--not at all Amazon's fault."
2,Rubber Tube Split-Broke After 4 Months of Use,"After 4 months of use, the black rubber tube broke. Was only used 2-3 times a week. It really wasn't used that heavily."
3,This stethoscope is alright,"It gets the job done, its not as senstive as the more expensive brands out there, but its still does an okay job. great to have around the house, and its packaged nicely"
5,Best buy,Best purchase I have made in a long time. Definitely worth it. Absolutely love it. Would highly recommend this product.
2,Often can't hear anything!,"I am returning this scope because it either is defective or simply doesn't work well at all. I have been using it to take blood pressure readings. Every now and then I can hear sounds, but most of the time I hear nothing. And yes, I know how to adjust it for using either the bell or diaphragm. Mostly what I hear are the ""static"" noises of touching the stem or tubing. I've been using it in a quiet environment and my hearing is fine. I can't imagine using this in even a room with A/C running, let alone an ER, unless you are monitoring someone with a very loud heartbeat. My advice is to invest in a top-of-the line Littman, and save your money elsewhere where people's lives aren't at stake. Just put a luggage tag on your Littman so someone doesn't walk off with it! Also, if you buy this, buy directly from Amazon who are better about returns than their associate sellers."
1,"Image so poor, I think it damaged my eyesight.","Was this advertised as new or what? The sound and image are so horrible, I think I damaged my sight squinting to see through the grainy screen; half-way through all I could see was a black screen for a few seconds. I returned it the next day.I'm surprised AZ is even selling this."
2,"Amateurish, but of definite interest","Made on a shoestring in Europe, this filmization of Richard Wright's literary classic has little to recommend it in the way of production values, yet it is of definite interest due to the casting of Wright himself in the lead role of Bigger Thomas. Already middle-aged at the time, Wright is a good twenty years too old for the part and his skills as an actor fall dramatically short of his talents as a writer. Nonetheless, I can think of no other ""serious"" author who has appeared on-screen in a film version of one of his novels (Norman Mailer, of course, directed a movie based on his ""Tough Guys Don't Dance""), and for that reason, this otherwise amateurish version of ""Native Son"" ranks as a curio. Admirers of the writer and his novel are not likely to be impressed by what they see here but, approached as a novelty, this film is worth a look."
1,Awful quality,I'm a big fan of the brilliant and historically important Richard Wright so it was with an extra degree of disappointment that I viewed this horribly transferred video and quickly decided to send it back. The quality is so bad that one wonders how it could even have been placed on the market for sale.
1,Why Is Amazon pushing this crap?!,This looks like a very bad VHS transfer. The visual and sound quality are horrendous! You'd do better to wait for TCM to air this and record it.
1,Inferior copy on recordable DVD,"No cover art, recordable DVD. Image quality very poor, perhaps transfer was made from a poor quality print or VHS."
4,Great job!,This book is excellent for any beginner or intermediate Web Designer. I have used it as a classroom textbook and all my students rave it's performance!Kudos to the author!
5,Great shoes,"I was originally hesitant to spend this much on shoes but considering I wore holes from seven years of wear on my last Sperrys, I decided to bite. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and will probably be buying the exact same pair in another seven"
4,Great Dependable Topsider,"A great shoe -- dependable size, fit, and comfort -- only casual shoe I wear -- got them in several colors."
2,"Not worth $170, Multi-layered sole delaminated","The shoes still look good, but the sole bottom has come un-glued from the EVA foam. I am dissapointed with Sperry shoes now for the fist time, with what is supposed to be their premium shoe."
5,Great Shoe,Best boat shoe ever made from an outstanding company. I would never buy any other brand. Comfortable the minute you put them on.
5,great bibs!,"Bibs are nice and soft and big sized, great for what I needed, my baby hasn't started solids yet and I didn't want the crunchy waterproof bibs, so this is perfect."
2,They work,"This bibs work, they velcro at the back of the neck and for my daughter that means that it can scratch the back of her neck... at one point even cutting her little skin. But, they are big and they are absorbent."
2,Not worth the money,This product is very thin for a bib. So it goes through my baby's clothes when it gets wet. Plus the closer on the bib is too rough and hard to detach.
5,Awsome,"When i first saw these speakers, i wondered whats so good about them. When i plugged them in and started to listen to music, i was totally blown away. This is a must for those looking for small but powerful speakers."
1,DISCONTINUED PRODUCT,"Clinique stopped manufacturing this particular product (""Clinique Repairwear Extra Help Serum""). This product has been replaced with updated versions."
2,Good album; horrible download,This is only for the downloaded version of this album.Songs are about 1/2 to 2/3 the volume of the rest of the songs on my MP3 player. Low quality download!
1,Not so good,These bras do not hold up very well. I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away - six months later.
4,"Great Price, Decent Nursing Bra.","Not nursing yet, but it's a very comfortable bra. It'd be better if the shoulder straps were elastic and the cups had another layer of fabric (won't matter when I start wearing nursing pads).Besides the price, I like that the cups are adjustable. Each cup can hook to 3 different levels of eyes. The hook and eye is hard to get undone with one hand, but with a little practice you can become a pro. Last time I nursed I used Wal-mart cheapies that had only one place to hook the cup (easy plastic clasp). Some days I had those cups so stretched. (The main reason I didn't buy at Wal-mart this time around was because they don't carry my size.)If you're looking for a good cheap bra this is it."
2,Nursing Bra,I didn't really like it. The clips are hard to clip. The fabric bunches up. I guess it is kinda comfortable!
4,Maternity Nursing Bra Review,"I'm content with this purchase though would have liked a little more support than the bra gives. However, the price was right for the over all product."
1,support,"I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again."
4,Black Metal Carnival,"This is a very interesting CD with intricate songcraft and superb production. What holds it back from being widely appreciated is that there are many moments that are so original as to sound bizarre. There are Black Metal passages layered with carnival music, which then shifts to a classic 70s rock groove; then changes to Progressive Doom Metal(a piano flittering in the mix). Overall, this is quite impressive, if not overblown at times. It may be a difficult listen at first, but those with patience will find some rewarding songs here. This is original stuff, to be sure."
1,"Read the Reviews, Bought It and was Ripped Off Too!","Upon receipt, I read the instructions and tried to sync the remote, which did sync up, but the display on the remote was blank? Called the customer service for Bionaire and had to pay $6.00 more for them to mail me a replacement remote. Followed instructions again...the new remote has a ""partial"" display and doesn't sync. It is worse than the original one! My only recourse now is to wrap the heater and remote up and ship back to them (according to their customer service), but I would have to spend more money to do that...NOT! I'll just keep the heater and use without the remote and be grumpy about the whole thing...Aaagh!"
5,Questionable Reputation proves Groundless for me!!!,"I live in Southern Louisiana and we just don't have much need for our furnances. I love to use these little space heaters to put the heat where we need it and not warm the whole house. I read the pro's and con's of this little guy, and I noticed people loved it or hated it. I can't judge these folks that say they have trouble with it, but mine has worked flawlessly since it came out of the box. The remote ""thermostat"" is incredible. I have noticed that once it gets a room to the set temperature, it may come on and run for only one or two minutes. But when you check the temp on the thermostat, it's keeping it right on the setpoint. I'm glad I looked past the negative reviews in this case. I love my little portable, digital, and powerful little heater and the amazing remote thermostat which controls its. WRJ"
3,needs more fan power,"Nice heater with good features. The thermostat and timer featurea work well. The problem is that the heat comes out of the three sided front, and the air is drawn in through a 4 inch diameter hole in the back. The fan does not push the air out into the room. Good for a small room like a bathroom, but not for a lager application."
3,Worked Great - When it worked,"Bought it in December 2005, worked great for 2 months. Automatic Thermostat was the reason I bought it. Now it barely puts out any heat. Bionaire is happy to provide me with a new one... on May 18th, 2006 when they finally get some in stock! What am I supposed to do until then? Central heating is looking like a good investment right about now..."
4,Really Like it,"Many of us use these heaters in our cubes at work and I have heard no complaints. The biggest plus is that the thermostat is in the remote unlike less expensive models. So far, I haven't had any of the problems described in other reviews. Oct 2005."
2,One heating element burned after 6 days.,"I bought three of these little heaters. One of the remote screen was cracked. One main unit won't sync. One set off a smoke detector because a heating element sparked after just 6 days. It's great when they worked, but..."
2,"Shouldn't a heater, ummm, heat?","There are lots of things to love about this little heater - it's little, so its easy to store away when you don't need it, it looks nice enough, it has a remote thermostat. But when I actually tried to use it, it blows my circuit breaker every time set on ""high"". This is the third house I've had since buying this heater, and none of the three have any electrical problems. Unless I try to run this heater on ""high"". On ""low"", it moves some air but will not give off any heat whatsoever.Going to find a radiator-style one that works..."
2,Should have headed the negative reviews,"Not very impressed with this heater. When I first got it, it sat there, just humming, with a burning plastic smell. I carefully took it apart and found that the fan was not attached to the motor in the back. There is no way it came off during shipment because it seats in very firmly, making it an easy permanent fix. Most likely it was never attached from the factory - poor quality control. The plastic casing itself is very brittle, with one edge chipping while I was putting it back together. Now that its finally working, I was disappointed to hear how loud it is. Definitely the loudest electric heater I've ever heard. I think this is due to the design, resulting in turbulent air flow within the unit. As a positive though, this thing pours out an impressive amount of heat for its size. In addition, the thermostat is a really nice feature that seems to work well."
1,shuts off in 5 mins or less,"I may have gotten a lemon, but this thing shuts off and must be reset(by unplugging it) within 5 minutes on low, less time on high setting. Pretty worthless to warm a whole room. At least the risk of it burning the house down would be an act of God. I'm sending this bad boy back!"
4,If only I could get one that worked....,"A friend of mine has one of these and it's been a workhorse. Of particular usefulness is the Galileo remote which has the thermostatic sensor on it. I've tried other brands that had the room temperature sensor on the unit and they were drastically off (sensor too close to the heating element).Unfortunately, the first unit that I ordered had a bad readout display on one of the temperature digits (you could only read part of the number). I exchanged it for another using Amazon's phenomenally easy exchange procedure (unlike the manufacturer who said the remote was ""not under warranty unless I bought it from them directly""). The replacement unit had a fine remote display (which was also accurate to a fraction of a degree), but the heating unit had a permanent buzzing sound that sounded like a transformer. This wasn't a problem in a noisy room, but it was loud enough to disturb sleep in a bedroom."
1,didn't work,"The unit I received shuts off unexpectedly when set on 'auto' and has an odd buzzing sound. I'm returning mine, because it doesn't work properly. UPDATE: Beware! Amazon will charge you a restocking fee if you return this heater as defective!"
5,We Love it,This small powerful heater keeps the room comfortable. It is great. When our boiler was being repaired our bedroom was just fine.
1,Still waiting for one that works,"I have been through two of these heaters-neither worked. The company promised to send out another, but it has been over a month since I purchased one online and am still waiting in the cold for them to send me one that works."
1,"Ditto ""shuts off in 5 mins or less""","I also see the ""shuts off in 5 mins or less"" problem. The heater stops and it flashes its little red lights. For the price, this heater is a piece of junk. The only thing it can do for me now is tell the room temperature, on the remote. (I am assuming the number it shows me is right; maybe that's not right either.)"
1,Ripped off,"I had high hopes for this product but was extremely disappointed.I bought it because I was interested in the remote/timer functions.The heater/unit was supposed to beep upon being plugged in. This never happened. Therefore, the remote was unable to sync up with the heater.[...]"
3,Good but no as detailed,"Those were good but not as detailed, they were shown as long leg but they were just the normal one."
2,CDs are poorly organized.,"I paid full price for this set because I'm planning a trip to Italy. The book isn't bad but the CDs are pretty terrible. They have boring drills on numbers and vocabulary. Not at all interactive. The phrases are read in Italian and then English, but sometimes in English and then Italian without warning. Since I know no Italian, I had a hard time knowing which English word went with which Italian word (and since I was listening in my car, I couldn't check the book while driving to find out). All in all this is a pretty poor set of language tapes, and it's way overpriced. I'm sure one can do better."
4,A readable introduction to this great English composer.,"How did a forty-one-year-old violin teacher in a provincial English town suddenly become one of Europe's most feted composers? Simon Mundy tells the Elgar story with relish and care, and anyone who knows Elgar's music will be fascinated.There are more detailed biographies of Elgar, notably the ones by Michael Kennedy and J.N. Moore, but, if you'd like a concise portrait of the man who wrote the Enigma Variations, the Dream of Gerontius and other landmarks in modern music, you'll enjoy this book."
3,will winter cap,"I bought this cap as a gift for my husband, who had a similar one in the past that he liked alot but lost. We liked the look of this one, but he found it scratchy. We returned it."
4,Good though not execellent product; excellent delivery time,"This cap came several days FASTER than advertised. The cap I bought (Small) fits well. The Salmon color is as what I had expected. the brim and sweat band are sewn well. The reason I don't give this a ""5"" is that I was hoping the cap would have been ridged. It isn't. Still for a ""floppy"" cap it looks very good and feels warm."
5,A Freestyle Favourite,"This album ""Cynthia 2"" is just as good as her self titled debut album. All the tracks on this cd rock but the biggest hit single from this set is ""Dreamboy/Dreamgirl"" feat. Johnny O. TTheir duet is still hot more than 14 years later. Any fan of freesytle and electronic/dance music would find this album to be a welcome addition to your music collection."
4,A Different Toy,"I purchased this for my 6 yr old grandson. The Sea Monkeys have hatched and are doing their thing. Very minute at this point, but it is a fun, interesting 'toy' -- I hope they continue to live for awhile!"
1,Way too much motion for sea monkeys,"Way too much motion for sea monkeys. It's better if you buy one of the other kits or keep them in a jar, goldfish bowl, etc."
5,Love it! And it has music only feature!,I dance to those three songs everyday and it is a great work out. I also found that it offers music-only feature so that I can dance for my guests. I like the three songs chosen in this dvd and am waiting for more this type from Julia Casper.
4,Cute & Fun Dance Workout,"I picked up this DVD at an electronics store in Germany around 2006 when it came out without ever hearing about it. Since then I have done this workout countless times.Sure, it's low budget, but it doesn't make it less good. I like that it isn't totally over the top like some other bollywood dance videos I've seen. Though it is kind of funny that when you do the dance, you get three of Julie Casper to make it look like there are several dancers.I like it because:1. It's cute, Julie Casper does a great job of showing the dance steps and gives it a cute feel to it2. Fun music3. Made me feel like I could really dance4. If you get into it you'll definitely get a sweatIf you're looking for a dance workout of high intensity to whip you into shape, this is probably not what you're looking for.But if you are looking for a fun kind of light dance workout you might like this one!"
1,Bollyrobics Dance Workout,I was very excited to get this DVD workout because the other reviewers gave good reviews. But I was disappointed. The 3 dances are very short. Too short for a workout. I think some movements should have been incorporated in a warm-up or cool-down and not in the aerobics part. I am a dance instructor who loves to add some Bollywood dance movements to the routine I teach. I did learn a couple of new good moves from this DVD. But that's all.
3,"Fun, but slow","If you have any dance experience whatsoever, the first routine with the veil will be boring. The only ""fun"" thing is the veil work, and it's repetitive and slow. The first song is not terribly exciting and reminds me more of bellydancing than bollywood. Bollywood is really bouncy and high-energy and the later two songs embody that more. It's a fun DVD overall, with a good progression, but for someone with any experience, you may be bored."
2,Terrible,This was the slowest dance workout I have seen yet. There must be about 15 minutes of just toe tapping. Also a scarf dance. Moves are repeated over and over... you get it. The only good thing is the finale song!
3,Boring,"This dvd was kind of boring for me. Its this one lady dressed in black with a computerized background. I could have made it myself. The moves are easy.If you want a fun bollywood workout try the bollywood workout with hemalayaa,The Bollywood Dance Workout With Hemalayaa"
4,super,Great fun. And it sure gets me sweating like a 3 mile run in the heat and humidity. Nice addition to my running.
2,Difficult to see the moves,This DVD has a very small image of the dancer/instructor against a very large background. I don't want to have to put on glasses to see the moves which I am trying to execute during a workout. I have a collection of over 70 workout DVD's and this is the only one during which I couldn't see the instructor well enough to execute the moves.
1,if you want to sleep,"I got this video for those days , when you feel like the gym, it is not the best option, but after watching for three minutes it was to much to take. I felt like I want to got to bed, boring, boring safe you money. If you looking for somethin fun get something else."
1,Bad Smell & Taste,"I was surprised when I first opened the foil wrapper and got a whiff of the strong smell. My first thought was that it was is a chemical smell! But, I then concluded it was really the smell of rotting or fermenting fruit. And, that's what I suspect is going on with this product. Just in case, I checked the expiration date - 11 months in the future. I've opened two of the packages and both had the strong unpleasant odor. The taste wasn't very good either; but, it wasn't as bad as the smell. Sorry, can't recommend the Orgran Blueberry Bars. Perhaps their other products are better."
4,stapler,Works great but watch your knuckles. Hold it at the proper angle or you will slam your knuckles into whatever you are stapling.......... and it hurts.
5,Great Garden Tools,These are great Garden tools. They are comfortable and well made. We have used them for a few years now and they are still in great condition.
2,Not microsoft digitally certified,"You'll get a strong suggestion from MS Windows XP not to install it for that reason. Aside from that problem, another is that it's controlless, meaning forget about using with Linux, and expect poorer performance (for instance, I could not download Open Office with it though I tried about ten times, my old serial modem did so the on first try). Also, it lacks modem lights, which are useful for a quick check of whether or not it's on, and/or receiving/sending data. It's marketed for travel use with a laptop, and may well be fine for that purpose; I was wrong to think it could be used as an all-purpose desktop modem."
1,No more Zoom for me....,"I've either received a faulty modem or it has major compatibility issues with the VIA Apollo 133A chipset. I'm A+ certified & have never had so much hassle with a modem. Once I was able to track down the tech support number (not an 800#) that is hidden in the .pdf files on the install CD, I called & received the most condescending & rude *help* of any tech support I've dealt with.I also have a Creative Modem Blaster USB & most definitely recommend it over the Zoom 3090. At least with Creative, if you run into install problems, you have great tech support. Zoom isn't worth the hassle. It hurts to give it 1 star."
1,Doesn't Zoom on XP,"The minimum processor speed for XP is 750MHz, a requirement not well documented!I never was successful getting my modem to actually go ""off-hook"". If I took the line off-hook by picking up an extension phone it would dial.The manual or web-site were not very helpful, except to tell me that my PC was below the new speed requirements."
5,Best Modem I've Ever Owed!,"I've had problems with my previous modem, it kept disconnecting on me. This new modem by Zoom was very easy to install, and my computer detected it right away. It connects to the internet in no time at all and now I never get disconnected. I've owned it now for two weeks and am very impressed. The price is very affordable too, especially with the rebate! The only thing is that it has not connected at a faster speed but I think that has more to do with the phone lines in my area. It is a great modem and easy to use!"
5,Easy to read and use. Beautiful to look at!,Barbara Kafka's Party Food has simple straightforward recipes. She has a grasp on what modern family life is like. There are lots of hints on how to make entertaining fun and relaxing. As an added plus the book has beautiful photographs. It is almost pretty enough to display. It is a great gift for any level of cook.
2,A bit frustrated,Well After I received the book I have to say I was quite disappointed because I am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .After I read the reviews I thought I was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .It turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .If you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed DONT BUY IT.The other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented .
4,An Avid Read,"This book was mediocre. It was good, but I expected much more. Celia and Junie were best friends and they brought in another girl, Danielle. They bonded over delish meals and built a friendship in a dinner club, just for the three girls. This book will make you laugh, smile, and even cry. This was an overall great read."
4,Good light read,"After reading Girls Dinner Club, I was left a little informed, a little overexposed, and a little touched. It had it's overly innapropriate scenes and was written for an older teen, but I still liked it. The food sounded so good! Celia's crush on Henry was a bit predictable, but so romantic! The book made me laugh, cry, and grimace. But most of all, it made me realize how important it is to have close friends. A good read."
3,The Girl's Dinner Club leaves me wanting,"I've been trying to figure out why the book left me wanting. The story lacked a certain emotional intensity. Perhaps it's because the author tried too hard. The three girls, three different ethnicities, three different lifestyles, three different schools concept left me with the feeling of seeing too much of the author's hand at work as I read through the story. It felt too contrived. The author could have mined the dinner club concept more, too, as it came off more as a plot contrivance. In the end I wanted to know more.The novel is clearly for the older teen (grades 10 and up) and not for those who are still young emotionally. I do think the author's handling of Julie's reaction to having sex is provocative. Her sudden need to distance herself from her boyfriend is something many girls may be surprised to learn happens.While I do have problems with the scope of this novel, I would certainly be interested in reading any future books by the author."
3,I love freestyle and this is a jam I can get off to,No one realy listens to freestyle but this is one of the cd's I can realy enjoy. I like to freestyle sometimes and this is a good beat to jam to. I would sugesst everyone to buy this cd! It's a hella good dance or should I say freestyle jam to listen to !
5,FREESTYLE RULES AND JOHNNY O IS THE CREATOR,"This cd is great, it has the longer versions of each of these songs. I highly recommend it to any freestyle fan."
5,johnny o is REAL COOL,"me and my wife listened to his music on our first date, nine years ago. and we still love his music. PLAINLY GREAT"
5,Johnny O the prince of Latin freestyle!!,Great cd from one of the greatest freestyle singers of all time!! Latin freestyle will live on forever thanks to great cd's like this one.We all love you Johnny O!! God bless you and your family.
3,Art & Intoxication,"A tasty little memoir or meditation! As the author sips the liqueur favoured by so many nineteenth-century authors and artists in a New Orleans caf√©, he muses on a variety of subjects from mystical visions of rainbows and peacocks to Prohibition and other issues of social mores. For collectors of Crowley's pioneering writing on drugs, probably a must-have. The pamphlet-like edition is somewhat marred by amateurish typography (the omission of accents in French quotations is particularly annoying), but an enjoyable read nonetheless. I found the quality of the writing to be reasonable value for my money. Cheers!"
2,HP does not reply to problems,"I purchased a HP2000C printer April 1999 for home use for [price]. It had fine quality print. I three weeks ago said I needed to replace the black print head and I did and it still did not work and replace the other 3 print heads total [price]and it still does not work. I have [price]in ink cartridges not used so I asked for help from HP three days ago and have not heard of thing. Prior to that I used as much a Cannon 600e and it is still in operation, gave it to my Dad, and never had to do anything with it. I recently ordered a Epson C80 for [price]less Epson rebate of [price]and I bet it last longer. I suggest Epson or Cannon."
3,Overall well built but line replacement difficult,"I purchased this weed trimmer a few weeks ago for my Father. I assembled it and added gas. After a few pulls it started right up. The choke automatically turns off when you pull the throttle trigger which is nice.A major feature when considering a string trimmer is how easy, or in this case difficult, it is to replace the trim line. Removing the spool is not too difficult but the design of the spool and specifically how difficult they have made it to get the line back on the trimmer without coming unraveled is troublesome.I would not buy this trimmer again due to this."
4,Poulan Pro PP125,"East to assemble, good power, easy to start, but I wish I had known that the rotation of the string was counterclockwise before I purchased it."
3,Long Time Concern,"I have owned my PP125 for some time and am very happy overall. The only problem I have had is the cover (Part No. 545003365) which wears out quite fast with use. I replaced the cover a short time ago and now need to replace it again. Most replacement parts are ""Made in China"" and are of very poor quality lasting a very short time. I have never had a cover wear out before on any of my trimmers."
5,"Easy, powerful, reliable","Just read the instructions, it's easy to assemble, put some gas and just start it, it works as a charm. It is really powerful and can cut some significant weeds. I recommend the brush cutter for more serious work otherwise the string is not going to last long. The brush cutter extension comes with a second handle and a shoulder strap that does not come standard with the trimmer.The machine has a reasonable weight and allows anyone to use it even for extended periods of time."
1,POS,Item ran through a half a spool of cord then started to bog down. Called company within two weeks of purchase and they told me to take it to an area service center. I waited two weeks to take it in. It took two and half weeks to service and then they told me a carburetor adjustment would not be covered under warranty. Adjustments are not covered after 30 days even though I called the company within two weeks. Make sure if you purchase this product you use it quickly to determine if it need adjustments. Product is made so the consumer can not adjust carburetor. Not happy will not buy Poulan again.
4,"Hard to start sometimes, but good overall","I have the trimmer and the edger attachment... both work fine. The string trimmer is pretty picky on gas, and sometimes is hard to start. But, it's never smoked and I've always managed to get it running... eventually. Changing string is pretty standard and the bump feed works just fine. It's a good deal for a cheap gas trimmer."
4,Poulan Pro PP125 a good buy,I've used the Poulan Pro PP125 for about a month now and have been quiet happy with it's performance. It does a great job edging around shrub and flower beds. It also does a good job on the higher grass and weeds along the jogging trail that runs behind our backyard. The only negative is that it runs very rough for several minutes after starting. But after it warms up it runs great.
1,Garbage,"As others have written, and as with my other Poulan product, the motor stalls and runs erratically. Out of the box, and after performing ALL steps properly, the unit never ran correctly. I called Poulan support and got a runaround. I took it back to the store for a refund, although the packing instructions said not to. Tough, Poulan -- if you made a decent product you wouldn't have to eat these when they come back!"
1,Worst piece of junk made,"Started it up and in ran fine for first 20 minutes, then the engine started bogging down. Looked up other reviews people have had similiar experience. Tried calling Poulan for help and was stuck on hold for 20 minutes. Not worth the time money or hassle to fix. Not going to purchase Poulan ever again. And I cant return it to Amazon either. JUNK!"
5,A dream to start!!!,This trimmer is a dream to start and runs great!!! The bigger gas tank allows you to run longer and the thicker line (.095 rather than the .080) saves line and cuts through the heavier stuff. The only knock I have on this trimmer is the weight - it is heavier than others in this class of trimmer but it is fairly well balanced. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who can handle the extra weight of this trimmer!!!
4,Good Trimmer; has few negatives,"This trimmer worked right out of box and works great. Starts right up each time - just be careful to follow instructions when starting hot, or let cool down first. A bit heavy for large yards - begins to wear on back after awhile. Also, the ""U"" handle begins to rotate with some attachments and can't seem to tighten enough. I bought attachments - edger, blower and they require more bending for a tall person like me. All in all, once you get a hang of it, works great and reduces my trimming time down from 30mins to 5-10 mins. Very easy to disassemble/reassemble. Straight shaft makes all the difference. will never buy curved shaft."
2,This is my least favorite of the weedeaters I've owned,"I have used 4 different weedeaters of various brands over the last 30 years, and I must say this is my least favorite experience. First, it has a straight shaft rather than curved. I had read that this was a good thing for tall people, but I am 6'4"" and I don't find it as comfortable to use. I have only used this new weedeater three times so far, and the first two times I had trouble with the cutting line staying in position. It would all just disappear inside the spool requiring disassembly and resetting the lines. Maybe it is resolved now as it worked fine the last time, but it seems rather touchy. It also seems to have less power than what I am used too, but maybe that is just because it is much quieter, which is a good thing."
4,Solid trimmer.,"I used a gas trimmer years ago and disliked mixing gas/oil and how hard it was to start, so I then used an electric for 4 years and disliked the cord hassle and wimpy line feeder, so now I'm back to gas. I've only had it a few weeks, but it seems to be well-made. It's much bigger and heavier than my electric. Starts moderately well, maybe 5-10 pulls of the cord, then warms up for a few seconds and it idles just fine. Seems powerful, though I just use it for grass, not heavy brush. The thick gage double-feed string is long-lasting. I recently scalped my entire yard of bermuda grass (maybe 500 sq ft) and it used hardly any string--a couple of bumps to feed it. Pretty easy to assemble. I'm pleased with it and would recommend it, though it's hard to really know after having had it such a short time. I do plan to buy the chainsaw attachment."
4,String trimmer,Works better than expected. Starts easily. Attachments are a breeze to fasten.Delivery was one day. Really a surprize.
1,"Junk, absolute Junk!","Today the entire item went in the trash after just two uses. Problem: won't ever start...ever. After (count 'em) more than 25 pulls one gets very frustrated. On first try the cheap plastic cover on the carb air filter intake fell off due to broken plastic connector. Printed instructions on side of motor say to ""turn lever to start"". There is no lever. Entire device is quite heavy and hard to ""steer"". Paper instructions are skimpy. Do not order this JUNK from Amazon or any else."
1,POS,"POS times 2 because this is my 2nd one in 60 days, I am stupid for not learning my lesson the first time. As for my recommendation after a month of using this: 1. it is fairly quiet and starts easily. 2. it runs badly (stalls), and if you put any load on it (i.e. with an edger attachment) it slows down appreciably. 3. the guard on the string trimmer is akward and virtually useless. 4. The lower handle is held on with a wing nut, and I guarantee you that it will loosen within two minutes and your handle will be in the wrong position."
1,Broken on Arrival,"Came in broken. Great. Called number on box that said to call if item is damaged. Some call center for Poulan. They couldnt care less my item was broken. All they would do is tell me to take it to a repair center. Great. Well, 6 weeks later my weed eater is still sitting at the repair center. I call and they have no clue when they will get to it.I called Poulan back and they said too bad. Wow, lot of help. I called Amazon and they didnt care either. Only 30 day window from purchase to return. 2 of those weeks were delivery time. The idiot i talked to asked, why didnt you call us first when it came in broken? My reply, uhhh because on the box in bold letters it says to call a specific number if product is damaged, which i did.So, i am out $$$ and have no product either. It never got used a single minute. Poulan is now on my dont buy list. As for Amazon, it was shocking how little they cared. Guess i will start buying retail in stores."
1,Would not recommend.,"Right out of the box the trimmer would not work! The shaft would not spin and the trimmer wouldn't shut off. Had to take to a Poulan repair shop, which was two weeks out for repairs. They found the shaft was not completely assembled and wires were crossed in the shut-off switch. Trimmer works fine now, but what a hassle."
1,Broke first time I tried to start it!,"I bought this brand new, not used. I cranked it once, and the parts that hold the spool in place..broke. I called the manufacturer, they said they are having a problem with this particular part, and they will get me one shipped out, but it will be awhile. That's just great. A real piece of crap! I wish I could give this a negative star rating!"
1,mtrawhide,"Don't waste money on this. I bought one a year ago. It is very hard to start, won't keep running and now leaks fuel from the bulb. Now won't start. Areal lemon!!"
1,"Runs great, but doesn't work!","The drive shaft for the lower shaft section is missing and the cutting head doesn't rotate, even though the motor end runs beautifully!Poulan customer service said, I need to take it to a Service Center. I really bought it to use, not to take to a Service Center. I am disappointed in the Brand. Amazon only accepts returns of unopened gasoline powered items. Hmmm!"
1,Not very good,"Thought this would be an upgrade over my TroyBilt which was starting to give me some problems after 4 years. Seems rather flimsy and there's a lot of vibration. There's no good way to adjust the trimmer head 90-degrees to trim along beds - and if you do, you can't see what you're trimming due to the guard. The lawn edger attachment has no sidewalk guide. I got my old one fixed, and will likely never use this one."
4,"Works fine, missing a part and could use another","Started up great, took a little while to get used to feeding the string spool but I always hear people complain about that so it doesn't seem to be new. The machine came missing the bolt that holds the handle tight so we will have to figure that out. Also, it can be heavy to hold if doing a big job and it seems like a shoulder strap would be helpful. I like the tap and feed for releasing more string when needed."
3,Hope your not in a hurry to get wacking weeds.,"Our first spin trimmer/weed wacker was the WeedEater. I think it was by Homelite. Small CC. Single and easy restring. It lasted forever and always started easy, first pull.Then bought a Ryobi double string. Bigger CC. It was hard to start from day one. Finally died.Shopped around looking for different brands at Home D and Lowes. Read reviews of different models and decided on this one. Came in mail. Read instructions 3 times. Put fresh fuel in. Tried to start it for 15 minutes without luck. Not happy.Called Amazon. Can't return anything with gas. Had to call Poulan. Took it to local service. Waited two weeks for repair authorization and carburetor adjustments. Picked it up and it started second pull.Winters here. Have to wait to spring for the endurance test."
1,Dissatisfied with supplier,"Poulan Pro PP125 17-Inch 25cc 2-Cycle Gas Powered Straight Shaft String Trimmer With Split ShaftI recently ordered this product thru Amazon.com. It was sold by Warehouse Deals,Inc.The spark plug was broken when I received the trimmer which is an easy fix. Unfortunately, after replacing the spark plug the engine started right up and sounded great but there was yet another problem. The connection was bad and the trimmer didn't rotate the line. Ugh....off to a lawn mower repair shop. The amount of trouble was worth it. After one month, I pick up the product that I haven't even been able to use once yet.I am not dissatisfied with the product yet because I haven't even been able to use it. However, I am completely dissatisfied that Warehouse deals would sell such a defective product to the consumer in the first place."
1,Unable to ship to California,"I can not verify to the quality of the weed wacker as they will not ship it to me. There reasoning for not shipping it, did not apply to me, or maybe they do not want to ship it to the LIBERAL state of California, who knows.............and no one is saying. I have had excellent results with Amazon in the PAST, this might change."
1,Don't waste your money on this product!,Having read many bad reviews about this product but I did not believe so I gave it a try...now I have to pay the price for that. The one of mine has the same problems as you can read in many reviews. I just don't want to say anything more because this thing is useless...more over Amazon will not let you return on this product!!! So beware of it!
1,stay away,junk!!! I would have been better off pulling out grass with my hands. This review won't let me give zero stars.
4,Works as advertised,"This string trimmer is a good tool for the occasional user. If it is used following the manual it will perform as advertised. The one that I have had an improper idle adjustment for 10% ethanol fuel, otherwise no problems so far (6 months of use).I bougth this tool because it can be also used with the edge trimmer attachment. Turns out that doesn't have enough power to run properly the edge trimmer. It needs to be run at high rpm which will overheat the engine."
1,Hard to Start,"The machine looks nice, but don't let looks fool you, this edger is VERY VERY hard to start, then when it finally starts it shuts off, then quess what ? start pulling rope all over again, the handle is attached by only a wing nut, the handle goes all over the place, very uncomfultable to use. Ones after a couple of hours when it does start, it cuts all right, I understand is a small engine, but this edger, stops cutting if you cut more then three pieces of grass together. Is a nice looking piece of equipment, but dont let looks fool you like they did me, its not worst the price, next time I will spend a little more and get a real edger, NOT A TONKA TOY"
4,Great trimmer!,"I spent a lot of time looking for a good trimmer at a reasonable price and this is it! I have not had any trouble starting or keeping it running. It has plenty of power. I even bought the edger attachment and it works great. My only complaint is the direction of spin, it shoots the grass right at your legs, but quite a few of the trimmers are like this. If your looking for a good trimmer for a good price, you can't go wrong with this one!"
2,Bad luck,"One of my few disappointing online purchases, the item did not work out of the box. Amazon policy for gas-powered items is not to accept a return. I did not pay enough attention to the prior post which referenced this policy. It also took awhile to find a telephone number for Amazon support and the representative I spoke with did not speak English very well. At first, she thought I would be able to return the item. When she couldn't arrange this, a supervisor explained to her that I would have to take the item for warranty repair.The closest Poulan repair dealer is an hour from my house, 2 weeks for them to check the unit, the clutch was defective, and they had to order the part. In all, it was 3+ weeks before I had a working trimmer.Trimmer is okay, not worth the aggravation...it does take awhile to get it going , idles rough, and the trimmer is slow to respond. I should have bought a trimmer at Home Depot"
5,ATTACK BOMBERS WE NEED YOU,"A fantastic insight into one of the lesser known bomb groups in the USAAF during WWII, many books have been written about the various bomb groups especially the Eighth Air Force ones and a lot by so called experts so this book comes as a real treat having been written by someone who was really there, The early history of the 416th thro to the final missions is a very fine document of how it really was and dispels some of the myths that the ""yanks"" had it all there own way. I thought the anecdotes were absolutely amazing Congratulations Mr Conte a military masterpiece."
1,Just Terrible - what a disappointment,"Based upon the good performance of Backup My PC by the same publisher, I purchased this product. What a waste of time and money. It offers no advantage over the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard in XP and, what is more, doesn't seem to work. I did the deferred transfer - which the user guide tells me to copy the data to a folder and then copy it to the destination machine. I did this three times- and it is painfully slow. Then each time the destination machine could not run the created .exe file (which it is supposed to do) and gave an error message that this was not a valid windows executable file. When I tried to reach Stompsoft for help, I was on hold for more than 45 minutes and finally gave up. I went back to the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard in XP which worked in about 1/3 the time and was just fine. I would ask StompSoft for my money back but I don't want to be on hold for another hour."
1,Stay away,"Unlike the other reviewers, I tried the Real Time transfer. What a nightmare! It didn't work at all. Their packaging says you can get support at their web site. Yet at their site, not only is this product not even listed in the knowledge base or troubleshooting sections, but the site isn't even FINISHED. Most pages have a ""coming soon"" (with no specifics of whether ""soon"" is next week, next month, a year from now - or a year ago). At this late stage in the evolution of the World Wide Web, there's simply no excuse for sending your customers to the dead end of a site that's still under construction.It's a horrible product with non-existent support. Only buy it if you're really hurting for an overpriced shiny new beverage coaster."
1,"A ""No"" star product","I tried every way that the instructions said to transfer data from my wifes old computer to her new one. I selected the files I wanted to move and created the ""executable"" file on her old laptop desktop. The new one would not work with it. I tried it live and still no progress. Finally I gave up and my wife preceded to copy her Favorites by hand and then enter them into her new favorite list. It was the same with her address book. What a pain. This software makes big promises but no results. Save your money and use Windows program. I wish I had."
4,Event TR 8 nice sound!,"I bought the Event TR8's used at a local shop. I have to say these are definately ""flat"" tuned. They are a great set of studio monitors for the $$$. I've listened to a couple of other monitors for twice the price and I think these can hold their own in the studio. These ARE NOT small monitors! They have a bit of heft to them. So if you are setting up shop in a small room or closet I'd go with something smaller. The TR-8's get pretty loud but you'd never need full volume. As with all studio refference monitors you really need to take the time to ""learn"" their sound. I'm pretty happy with these monitors and see myself using them for quite a while!"
3,Excellent Value for a small room,"This is perfect for the college dorm or small apartment. Good bass, although when watching movies one may need to turn it down in order to avoid distortion. The woofer should be placed in an enclosed area to really maximise its potential.Speaker cables are problematic as they are not flexible for different layouts. Hiss levels on this speaker setup are also loud for something this small.Overall, a good economy buy, but don't expect world class sound quality."
5,Loved this book,"Our family loves this book! My husband will use the catchy phrase ""just a thought Mr. Fox"" when ending sentences with us. This is a wonderful book that our daughter instantly made one of her favorites. We read this book at least three times a week and sometimes more."
4,Endless Classroom Possibilities,"When fox finds piglet at his door, he is certain it is his lucky day. Piglet quickly convinces fox though that he isn't quite ready for roasting. After a bath, a good meal, and a nice message - piglet should be ready to go, but fox falls down in exhaustion - caring for his supper was hard work! Piglet indeed had a lucky day - now he just needs to decide who to visit/outfox next.A great read-aloud. Would work extremely well with felt or story-board to allow students the opportunity to re-tell. Would work well to work on prediction with context and picture clues."
5,My Lucky Day,"It was indeed my lucky day when I found this book! My daughter is 16 and, if I had my way, I would still be reading this to her! It was a very enjoyable book to read out loud, and I imagine, to listen to! I am saving this book for my grandchildren and any friends that have grandchildren.I wish this book had been around when my older two children were small.My favorite part of the book is the pictures; they could tell the story all by themselves!Thank you many many times to the author! Just one plea: write more books!"
5,Could Not Stop Laughing!,This book is adorable! I made all my children ages 13 on down sit with me and read it. Loved the pictures of the poor piggy being tied up. The best part was the massage scenes! I could not stop laughing. Can't wait to read this to my preschoolers.
5,Best Book,My son and I love this book and I had to have it the first time I read it! It is so adorable and cute! It's his favorite book and I never get tired of reading it everyday! Everyone should have this book. I'm probably gonna get one for my stepdaughters son the second he is old enough for this level of reading.
4,Excellent theory of the origin of war,"This is an outstanding reference for those seeking to understand how war came about and especially whether all societies were and are prone to war. Kelley presents a rigorously logical exposition of the notion that war is relatively recent and a result of social organization. All societies kill, but only those that are segmented and labeled appear to engage in large scale planned violence. Sometimes his conclusions are counterintuitive - as when he argues that, rather than scarcity, it is abundance that leads to war: ""...it is under the latter circumstances that that a society can afford to have enemies for neighbors."" While the prose can be somewhat dry at times, the reader is rewarded with numerous thought-provoking insights that are missing in watered down accounts of war intended for the general audience."
1,Unreadable prose,"This book is impossibly jargon-filled. The author writes as if addressing a tenure committee. Consider this sentence from the introduction: ""Defining war and delineating the boundaries between war and other partially similar phenomena raise important issues with regard to both classifying hunter-gatherer societies in terms of the presence and frequency of warfare and ascertaining the point in a sequence of conflictual events at which war has begun."" After reading this sentence how many readers will proceed any further? I would recommend Richard Keeley's War Before Civilization as a concise, forceful argument full of vivid examples written in plain English for the general reader."
2,Review of Jesus and the buddha,"This is not a good book to read via kindle because of the formatting. Apparently thr comparable sayings are indented and separated in the book however on the kindle ... Often Only Part of one saying is on one page and it is then continued on the next page, and then the comparable saying is on yet a third page. It is very distracting to see the comparisons if I keep having to flip pages."
2,lots of open space for interpretation,"This book was one to which I was looking for great amounts of information and comparative studies between the sayings of Jesus and the Buddha. What I received was a beatiful little book with one verse or set of verses from the Christian scripture on one page and a verse from a sutra on the opposite page......that's it!!! No scholarly discussion, no commentary, no historical information.....nothing else but the two ""versions"" of the same saying. This reads more like a Hazelton daily meditation book than an academic comparison between the sayings of [perhaps] two of the greatest, most influential, and well known prophets of recorded history (the other being Muhammad). This is a cute little book to keep in the bathroom or on your bed-side table. It is NOT an academic or scholarly comparison of the Parellal Sayings of Jesus and the Buddha. 1 star for cuteness, 1 star for context, no stars for scholarship."
2,Handy but Mediocre,"If you are seeking a great academic comparison of the Buddha and the Christ, look elsewhere. If you are seeking devotional material, this book will disappoint you. If, however, you are interested in a beginner's reference guide outlining a few of the parallel teachings of Buddhism and Christianity, you might be interested in this book.Oddly enough, the Introduction and Editor's Preface are at least as stimulating as the text itself. If you decide to read this book, you may wish to pay particular attention to those first few pages."
2,Riding the Fence,"Marcus Borg has given good scholarly effort and quality research to this book. The format is reader-friendly and has some good thought provoking statements from both Jesus and Buddah. All of this being said, spiritual seekers should use much caution in reading this book. I am a follower of Jesus Christ, He has transformed my life which is something no one, including myself, could do. In his introductory remarks Mr. Borg calls himself a ""non-exclusive"" Christian, which to me is contradictory to Jesus' remarks in John 14:6 where He says, ""I am the way, the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except by me."" It is for this reason that I give the book 2 stars and didn't finish it."
5,Beautiful and fun!,"We are very satisfied with the Princess Lacey/Kathleen Doll. She is very adorable. Her dress is pretty and her face is cute, but her hard/solid body mold was unexpected to my daughter. My initial thought was that the platform was a stand that she (the doll) would spin upon. Instead, there is a cylindrical wheel at the bottom of her foot, which allows her to spin once the motor on the stand ""winds"" it to its highest velocity (if you wind it for thirty seconds). This doll was much more fun than we had expected! She loves her Princess Lacey doll. Thank you!"
3,Just OK... Really loud!,"We bought this heater to help out with some cold areas of our house, including our family room and our 2 year old's bedroom. It does an OK job of heating, and the ocillating feature is very nice, but it's very loud. In order to get ant real heating effect out of this thing, you'll really need to set it on the higher heat setting (1500 watts). It is extremely loud. The thermostat regulates the temperature on the heater, but the constant turning on and off is very annoying. Otherwise does an OK job."
3,"Loud, but efficient","Who would have thought that an electric heater that is this small could be this loud! When I read the reviews written by others on this page, I assumed it would be noisy. But this unit is beyond noisy - it is nearly jet engine LOUD. So loud in fact, that for the last two nights it has awakend me when it kicked on.It is a very functional unit. And I love the digital controls and the nightlight feature. It works great and heats a cold room in a hurry. But, sadly, I can not recommend it because of the EXTREME noise that it puts out."
5,Bionaire Digital Power Heater,"This heater is relatively small, fitting into an equally small space. It produces a very satisfactory heat output. Where I live (in the Arizona high-desert), it's very hot during the summer but also very cold during the winter. I fully expect to have a warm, pleasant winter with this particular heater."
3,It's great for as long as it works.,"After a year, it stopped heating and now is a cooler instead? I just expected it to last longer for the price."
3,"Kudos, Therone!",This novel captures the lives of young single mothers and the struggles they endure and overcome to raise their children in a positive manner.
2,a confusing pastiche of previously written articles,"I found this book to be a hard read. It appears to be a pastiche of previously written articles, with a bit of glue to tie them together. It thus jumps back and forth in time abd subject. For example, an early chapter mentions the overthrow of the Gang of Four, with no explanation. Several chapters later we finally get a description of how this happened. There is a swirl of Chinese names, most mentioned without any description of who this person is. I found the results to be pretty confusing. After reading it I still don't have a clear idea of a timeline of events."
2,One out of two,"There are two sagas in this volume, but only the first (Gisli Sursson's Saga) is worth reading. It's a very interesting story, nothing high-brow, just a simple action thriller about a man who lives as a fugitive for thirteen years, making many harrowing escapes before finally falling valiantly in the end (and not without taking a few others with him!). The second one (The Saga of the People of Eyri), however, is a bit of a disappointment. Not only are there way too many characters to keep track of, but each subplot builds up in excellent drama, only to be resolved in a paragraph by someone paying a fine or something. Disappointing. And boring. The first (Gisli) is stll pretty good, though."
2,"Fun to watch, but not a good instructional video.","I was disappointed in this video. The ""girls"" in the video are all excellent dancers, and their moves are very interesting to watch, but the instructional part is very poor. They barely show you the steps, and when they do, it's very fast and hard to follow. Some of the steps are not demonstrated at all, and it's just assumed that you know how to do them. This is definately not a beginner video, and even if you are a good dancer, you need to have a good handle on hip-hop moves in order to follow along. You do get a good cardiovascular workout though, once/if you finally get the hang of it. I had to do a lot of rewinding, and watching the steps over and over, just to figure out what they were doing."
3,"Q&A on Life, Love, Sex, Sports,Death and More!","Odds 'R provides a series of questions about the odds of various events occuring. Some are fairly easy to guess at, most are fairly difficult. Provides good material for conversation filler."
1,Not a book on odds,"This book is not really what it advertises itself to be. It is not about the odds of things. Rather, it is just a book of fairly random trivia and useless statistics.The book is in the form of a quiz. For example:Q: In which of the following countries are you most likely to have to bribe a government official to get things done?a. Colombiab. Turkeyc. FinlandThis is not a question of odds, it's simply a trivia question, and not a particualry interesting one at that.I'm being harsh because this isn't what one expects. As a trivia book, I'll give it 3 stars."
5,Simply Amazing...,"I am a huge fan of the Corrs, and waited A LONG TIME for this CD. It was definitely worth it. The vocals are just phenomenal with Andrea belting out the catchy choruses. They seem to have added the lost sound of the violin and tin whistle, present in over half the songs. The climax, to my surprise, is the title track, ""Borrowed Heaven"" recorded in Africa with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It adds a tribal beat, and the ending leaves you with chills. Other favorites include the future singles ""Angel"", written about their mom, and ""Long Night"", as well as ""Hideaway"" and the instrumental ""Silver Strand"". As written in the review, very little filler is present on the CD. All the songs, minus ""Time Enough for Tears"" are in a league of their own. Borrowed Heaven is simply a must-have for any Corrs fans or anyone interested in the most talented group Ireland, (or anywhere for that matter) has to offer."
5,Gotta Spin It Twice,"After popping the cd into my car stereo and bumping through each track I was sadly disappointed. ""What's with all that synth crap?"" Then I got to the last track, 'Silver Strand'. Wow! I thought, if nothing else, this one track was well worth the $16.00 I paid for the album. Genius, pure genius.So later on I decided to give BH another shot while I was cleaning the house. Somehow something had changed from when I listened to it in the car. Was this the same cd? Sure looked the same to me. But this time around I was listening to wonderful sounds and brilliant lyrics. Can't explain. Once again, The Corrs are back. Great piece of work, this Borrowed Heaven. Give it a spin or two."
2,An Unispired Moment of the Career....,"You know, every band around the world who make sucess has their W-time and this is one, with this CD, probably, the worst of the band, they tried to add some electronic devices, to sound more techno, good for the people who like to dance, not for the fans of the band, in my case, some say a change is necessary, to sound more ""modern"", I don't care about this, I love the band and their sound when they hit the world, and no matter how many songs they write in this way, the songs may differ in lyrics but if there are good melodies, then, this is the one I want and the reason to keep me buying their CDs, not with this one, if you insist to have it, just buy the CD single ""Summer Sunshine"", which is the real The Corrs I used to know..."
2,Nothing new here,Being a big Corrs fan I was expecting quite a bit more than what I heard on this CD.
3,A MIXED BAG......,"Being a pretty big fan of THE CORRS, I was very anxious to purchase their new cd today. The uptempo winner SUMMER SUNSHINE and the ballad TIME ENOUGH FOR TEARS are terrific!!!! The other tracks from track 1-7 are great as well.......track 8-12 lost all my interest!!! It was like tracks 1-7 were from one album and 8-12 were from something else.....they sound perfect on this album.....just the material from 8-12 does not live up to the rest!!!! I am still a fan!"
2,Commercialism just does not work for this Band,"As a huge Corrs fan I hate to give them this rating. I hate to say this to a band that I saw live 2 days in a row and paid for front seat tickets, because I love the music they play. I am not much a pop fan (I listen to classical, opera and rock music) but the Corrs grabbed my undivided attention for some time. I was very excited for a new album. But when this album came out it was a very big disappointment. Imagine Sharon is very much under used in this album. This album does not have any stand out picks. I know they are a big Fleetwood Mac fan but why follow them!!! I am not giving up on this group. I will still watch their concert if they decided to come back to my country. But I really hope and pray the next album would be in the league of their former albums."
3,hate to do it...but,"I was very disappointed with this album. I am a huge Corrs fan and was very eager for the next album. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing here that really grabs me. Most of the songs are so-so, with utterly forgettable melodies. I say ""almost"" because I really like ""Hide Away"". And ""Long Night"" is worth the price of admission for me. It is one of my favorite Corrs songs to date. So much of this album is just downright annoying. It sounds like a lot of songs that didn't make it on previous albums. Very disappointing. Hope they do better next time."
2,They tried to change...for worst....,"Poor album, probably, the worst, they hired a new producer and tried to change their sound to techno and it sounds awful, if you are a fan of the band, just buy the single ""Summer Sunshine"", the rest of the CD is not worth"
3,average,the only other Corrs cd I own is In Blue. The new album Borrowed Heaven is definitly not as good b/c some of the songs seem out of place.
2,Poor Offering from A Good Band,"This really is a mixed lot with some catchy tunes and some haunting melodies and also some fillers. Like 'In Blue' before it, this does not reach the standards of 'Talk On Corners' or 'VH1 Live in Dublin'. Standout tracks are 'Summer Sunshine', 'Long Night' and the Gavin Friday/Bono collaboration 'Time Enough For Tears'.Other than that, the rest are B-Sides at best...Disappointing"
2,Formulaic,"By about 6 songs in, I realized this CD was going in one ear & out the other, with no real standout track. It is overproduced, full of the modern day effects (electronic drum fills, vocal telephone effects, etc.). The beats to many of the songs are very much the same, each song breaks into the big sing-a-long chorus, but that's just it...they all get to sound the same. Somewhat of a moody feel to it, suspecting they're trying to fit into the current radio play style...and it doesn't work, at least for me to be an enjoyable, or memorable CD. I was disappointed - this band caught my ear by being SO different, and now this release is surprisingly predictable. There's so much studio editing here that I doubt if much of the finished product is ""the actual band"", or resembles what the band can do live."
2,"A huge step down from ""In Blue""","The Corrs are one of the few bands that emerged in the 90s and made beautiful and enduring music. They got consistently better since their first album in the mid 90s and hit their musical peak with ""In Blue"" - a classic album. Unfortunately, the band has been unable to recreate the magic of ""In Blue"" on ""Borrowed heaven"". Andrea Corrs's sweet and infectious voice is not enough to save this album either. While ""Borrowed Heaven"" and ""Long night"" are songs that belong to the same league as previous hit singles such as ""Breathless"", ""Dreams"" and ""What can I do"", the rest of the album while being very listenable does not have any standout tracks. I am still confident that their next studio effort will be significantly better."
4,Just as breathtaking,"..although, It had disappointed me with the lack of Irish-sound, Borrowed Heaven woes us with the soft melodies and pop-irish sound.The vocals are beautiful and they have come a long way.Songs I highly recommend are ""A Long Night""- a sad melody, ""Time Enough For Tears"" a song co-written by Bono, the lyrics are beautiful.This album only improves everytime I listen to it- and I've only listened to it three times.Ive been a long time fan of The Corrs and hope to hear much more from them in the years to come!"
4,¬°Ya era hora!,"Despu√©s de casi cuatro a√±os sin publicar un disco de estudio, los hermanos The Corrs han vuelto... ARRASANDO. Este disco no debe faltar a los fans de The Corrs, yo ya lo tengo ¬øy t√∫? espero que si. Bueno, mi canci√≥n favorita es Angel, y el video me encantan, como me gustar√≠a casarme as√≠, The Corrs tocando... ¬°seria genial! ¬øno creen?. De todas formas, tengo algo malo que decir de este disco, por eso le he puesto 4 estrellitas. Creo que le falta m√°s inspiraci√≥n c√©ltica, la canci√≥n instrumental es preciosa por eso creo que deber√≠an incorporar m√°s de este estilo."
3,Just okay . . .,"I have such high expectations of the Corrs, having purchased all of their previous studio albums and the Live in Dublin conert CD. This one left me a little disappointed. Andrea Corr still sings beautifully and Caroline is probably one of the best pop/rock drummers in the world, but what's missing is a few powerful breakout hits and the masterful harmonies of their earlier songs such as ""Say"" or ""When He's Not Around"". The effort is there and there is nothing wrong with the sound - I'd say it's better than most studio pop. It's been described as a ""fans album"", and I think fans of the band will enjoy it, but it may not convince new listeners as to why this band is a worldwide sensation."
2,Hoped for a little better,"I'm a big Corrs fan and have been since their beginning. I expected more, and had hoped for more from the Corrs with this release. However, after several listens this CD begins to grow on you. ""Long Night"", ""Humdrum"", ""Even If"" and ""Silver Strand"" are the strongest tracks and ""Summer Sunshine"" is a good pop single. The weakest track, in my opinion is ""Angel"". For some reason I find it difficult to listen to. I have the Australian pressing which includes the bonus track ""Miracle"". It's a shame they left it off the U.S. release because it is one of the better songs on the CD."
5,Another great album from the Corrs,"This albums is a little ""harder"" than the previous ones. I don't know if that is the right word, but it is different than the other ones. It's not ""poppy"" or ""folky"". Basically, to me, it is just an evolution or maturing if you will. It is the Corrs expressing themselves at this particular point in their lives. The subject matter, the music. It is where they happen to be. I like it. I do not like, however, the out of focus picture in the sleeve. Maybe that means something. Maybe that is some sort of self expression thing. Hmm."
2,Not quite what I was expecting....,"As a big Corrs fan since 1998, I have to say I was sort of disappointed with this new album. It's a good pop album, but not a masterpiece for the Corrs. WHERE'S THE BODHRAN AND THE PENNYWHISTLE? Where are the defining Irishness that put the Corrs ahead of other pop acts? I have to say, the EPK acoustic versions of these same songs made a better lasting impression on me than the actual album... at best, this is a continuation of ""In Blue"", and 1 of those is enough!"
4,4 YEARS LATER AND STILL GREAT!,"For some, borrowed heaven may be a mixed bag. While borrowed heaven may not be as spectacular as the first three studio albums, it still manages to deliver some worthwhile, catchy tunes such as ""summer sunshine"" and ""angel."" Personally, my favorites are ""long night,"" ""goodbye,"" and ""hideaway."" It's been almost ten years since The Corrs first made their mark and I'm hoping for another ten years. Thank you to Andrea, Jim, Sharon, and Caroline for continuing to write great music for those of us who appreciate true talent.LONG LIVE THE CORRS!"
4,Good album but not their usual stuff..,"I became a Corrs fan when IN BLUE came out and since have all their albums. I enjoy this new release from the Corrs. It steers somewhat away from the heavy Celtic flavored music that they became well known for but at the same time, I didn't feel that the songs were overproduced with the new pop edge at all. This album will most likely disappoint those who mainly favor the full Celtic instrumental sounds of the Corrs but for those who do enjoy pop influenced music will also enjoy this album and I think the Corrs will win many more fans from this release, atleast from the USA. I really don't think it's any more pop-based than IN BLUE is but that's my take."
2,Doesn't teach you anything,"I was not happy with this ""guide."" This DVD does not teach you how to do the moves. It shows the moves and replays them a couple of times with barely and explanation. This is definitely not the ""Ultimate"" guide. This is a waste of money. Just go on YouTube and search up tutorials there. They have a much better explanation and you can actually learn how to do the moves instead of watching and wondering exactly what they are doing."
2,"Nice flavor, terrible texture","I followed the exact recipe and used this mix in my bread machine. It came out uncooked in the center. I ran the bake cycle twice and still it's soggy in the middle.The taste is ok, but the texture is a disaster"
2,OrgranN alternative grain wholemeal dread mix,"I didn't care much for it's taste and texture.It crumbled apart,so I only used it for single decker sandwiches."
3,huge dissapointment,"I thought this game would be different than the other Grand Theft Auto games, but I was sort of right. This game offers new vehicles, new hiding spots, a new twist to missions, and the ability to date and ""try your luck"" with your girlfriend. It offers mini games like darts or bowling. However this game was very bland overall, there was so much boredom to the missions you cant help but to rampage through the street with an rpg and a semi-auto machine gun, but even that hits its peak and drops like a rollercoaster. I would not buy this game having played it. 3/5"
2,"Boring, Repetitive, same old same old.","I didn't really know what to expect with this release. I have played every previous grand theft auto release before this. I thought the first one on PlayStation 2 was awesome along with San Andreas. The others were same old same old. Now this. There is NOTHING new in this release. It's the same old same old. Boring and repetitive. I think I might be done with the grand theft auto series after playing this. The ""friend"" thing they entered in this game is lame and annoying.I don't what else to say. The game is dull, the main story is actually ok, it's very repetitive, and did I say DULL? I'm mad that I wasted $60 bucks on this game."
4,Product Review,"I bought this game as an impulse buy one day. I was just really wanting to shoot some ""colorful"" characters, haha. But it arrived promptly. The game was in okay condition. It froze every once in a while, and you would have to restart the game, and then it would be fine for a while. Thanks for the order!"
1,Does not work on most PCs do not buy for PC,"Been working for hours to get this thing to work. Patches, blogs etc. On the blogs, found MANY people are having the same problem I am. After a REALLY long install process it just doesn't work. You get an error. After some hunting around online you find a patch. It stops the error, but unfortunately simply NOTHING happens when you click play. reinstalled, etc etc. Its broken. They released a game that just doesn't work on Windows 7 and said it did. Very annoying. I am sure there are some flukes where it has worked but essentially it is a paperweight."
1,GRAPHIC DRIVE ALERT,I love the GTA series but to play this one on a regular pc you have to have a certain graphics drive do not buy unless you have the right graphics drive. Or you can not play it.
3,Another GTA,Its the same old boring mission based game-I only baught it for the possible fun there could be online.Online its fun for team deathmatch but that gets boring after a few hours.Its a fun game if you have never played GTA before-But if you have a 360 and never bought Halo 3 get that instead.
1,Horrible installation,"What more needs to be said about this? The game is okay, but the installation is horrific. Every other review echoes this. It's junk.This is easily the worst port I've ever come across, and all of the crap you have to go through to get it installed is ridiculous - especially since you'll end up getting fatal errors that prevent you from playing it anyway.It's no small amount of irony that the very thing these companies do to prevent piracy are what lead people to piracy in the end."
2,It was great until....,I bought this game last week along with a new xbox 360. I bought it brand new. I got it in the mail today and was playing it for a few hours when a windown popped up on the screen that said Disc is unreadable take it out and clean it with a soft cloth and restart the console. Well I did just that and when I looked closer there was a Scatch in a perfect circle around the game and a few others. My hands hand only been on the game twice and not on that surface.
1,SCAMMED.,I even paid for 2 day shipping!Disc was not readable before even playing.VERY DISAPPOINTED.. that I have to doing the packaging and returning stuff. Hmph!
3,Good buy.,Came in the mail fast. I was a good deal. kind of hard to figure out at first but fun. Could be a better game.
1,Disgusted with Amazon,"I have written to amazon a billion times but no response. the game does not tell one if it is in PAL or NTSC & as a result i've bought a version not compatible with my gaming console. Neither am i able to return as I am not sure if it offers an alternative. Can someone please respond? Come on Amazon, I am a regular clientelle, the least I would expect is a response!!"
3,Unbelievably disappointing,"I bought this game based on the so called ""10"" reviews from the major outlets. I now no longer trust reviews from these so called major outlets. San Andreas was awesome, but this one is just... so blah.Why?#1. A story that went no where. ""Godfather"" of video games? That's laughable. There is nothing that propels the story forward.#2. Characters that have no depth. Stupid villains and extraneous characters. I didn't care for any of the characters in the game.#3. Gimped game play from previous game. They took out all the elements that were fun in the previous games.#4. Money serves no purpose in the game! You can't buy anything in the game!#5. After the first 3 hours, the game became repetitive and boring.Rockstar, you've lost a fan."
1,Could be better,"Most games mostly try to succeed from others and try to be different, but it doesn't seem like that was what GTA4 was trying to do. Now don't get me wrong it probably has the most realistic story but aside from all that, wheres the fun? The multiplayer is just insanely horrible and the graphics are somewhat decent. It's not that I suck at the game and I'm raging, in fact I've gone quite far it's just too boring..."
2,"OK, not sure what the hype was all about",Way too much hype for this game. Its alright but nothing spectacular. Missions are pretty much the same throughout and gets boring after awhile. Way too many simulated violence and swearing. Not needed at all for a good game. If they ever come out with a GTA5 I'm pretty sure I won't get it.
2,ehhh...,"It's alright. The graphics are amazing, but the gameplay gets old really fast. I just don't find it as enjoyable as the previous installments in this franchise. The camera angles while driving are terrible also. Plus it is difficult to turn your character around. he moves real slow and is very uncoordinated."
2,Ummm..no,"This is the fourth installment in the GTA series, yet there are still basic rudiments of gameplay that are still broken and in desparate need of fixing. The controls make doing even the most simplistic tasks complex, and I don't like how you are forced into doing tasks at the beginning of the game before the world completely opens up to you.I also don't like how you can't customize your character's gender or looks in anyway. Yes the story is dependent on being Nico Belic but the story could just as easily have been constructed to give the player more freedom in who they want to be.The best thing about GTA IV is the graphics and I can't see anything else about this game that deserves a perfect rating but it has received several perfect reviews as evidenced by metacritic. Color me perplexed because I just don't get it."
3,Rockstar forgot about the basics...,"The graphics, level of detail in both environment and characters, music,and plot are all very good. However, it seems Rockstar took a very big step backwards with the player control (both on foot and driving) and camera angles. I actually start getting a headache after an hour or so playing this game because of the horrible camera angles. Turning corners while driving requires you to use the left stick to turn and the right stick to look in that direction to prevent smashing into another car. This game would be a 10/10 or 5 star if they took the controls and camera from GTA III and put it in this game. It's too bad because this game is amazing but I just can't get past the controls and camera. You may want to rent it first (if you can find a copy that is not being rented) before dropping $60 on it."
4,its great,"pro:it has online and in offline (""story mode"") u can blow up cars with bombs ectcon:it dosent have any airplanes the packer is not what it used to be mostly small stuff like robing someone at night :) but otherwise there isent much to complane about"
3,First Impressions...,"So far, I gotta say ""meh"". It's a fun game, but nothing really new. I'm not impressed by the graphics at all, especially after COD4; in game and cut scenes look like last gen to me, kind of blocky and a lot of sharp edges. So far the hand to hand fighting sucks, but the shooting is much improved. Everything that I've seen so far, Saint's Row did better and made it look better. Over a couple of hours, I've made like 4 cab trips, took out some drug dealers, and went bowling. Whoopee! Please tell me it gets better..."
4,Good Game,This game is pretty good and the price is a bargain. You can do alot more in this gta game than the previous gta games like watch tv and drive drunk. i gave it 4 stars because the driving is kinda awkward and it takes some getting use to.
3,Its actually boring,"This game gets repetitive and boring very fast.I loved the previous games in the series, butI can't even be bothered to finish this one.Dont believe all the hype."
3,"Same boat as ""Conflicted Gamer""","The previous review is pretty much spot on w/r to my review of the game.On one end the expansiveness of GTA4 is awesome, but at times I also feel like its a total drag.I suppose I just don't have the patience for going out on dates and bowling mini-games and the like.Also, I have to echo the previous review again and state the cars in GTA4 feel a lot sloppier than GTA3."
3,"Great, but could've been LEGENDARY.","Rockstar definitely did a great job of maximizing the capabilities of both Next Gen consoles. The graphics and the game play are amazing, especially compared to that of the last gen versions that seemed to be drawn with color pencils and markers. My only beef is that the game is WAY too short, considering how much game time we got from San Andreas. GTA San Andreas consisted of 3 large cities, filled with a significant chunk of storyline. How could it be that, the newest edition.. on a superior system, could not even come close to that? GTA IV is basically NYC and a few surrounding cities.. which have only a small portion of the story? I was literally expecting this game to last for weeks.. but only a week and a half into it, I am almost done. I didn't play nonstop.. I played only a few hours at a time and sure enough, I'm nearly done. Definitely disappointing considering what could've been."
1,Bleh,"Way Way too many bugs, had 3 save files crash corrupting all my data. Missions are horrible long always ending in a huge chase through the city, and if you fail you start over at the very beginning. Graphics are great, but this is not rockstars best effort."
2,Not what I expected,This Game is by far not what I expected. After waiting in a long line and 80 bucks it was a waste of my time and money!!! While the graphics are a step above the gameplay has somewhat diminished. The missions are boring and this game brings me no exitement. San Andreas and Vice city were good from start to finish and afterwards. But this I don't know what this is... It freezes quite often too while playing in multiplayer mode I know the problem has been acknowledged but O well it is what it is. Now I know the next series to come out I will buy off of amazon at a discounted rate!!!!!!!!
2,Ok,"My cousin plays it when he comes over but he is the only one that plays it. I don't usually play it because it seems like rubbish but he seems to like it, he is the only one that plays it....."
5,All around good game.,"This game has a great story, a great big sprawling environment, and a lot of fun distractions. The graphics are excellent and it seems like Rockstar perfected the style they've been developing for this series for so long."
5,More fun than real LIFE!,"This is pretty much one of the greatest games of all time. Incredible graphics, sound, and gameplay make this a must-have for any human being. All of the innuendos and little easter eggs in this game keep me consistently entertained and coming back for more. If you have any kind of sense of humor at all you will love this game. Hell... even if you don't I'm sure you'll love this game. Just buy it, and get hooked like everyone else. You'll see! The $60 you pay for the game is nothing. I'd say this game is worth twice that amount for all of the hours of entertainment you get from it.Oh yeah, and in addition to the incredible single player mode there is a HUGE multiplayer mode too! They didn't skimp even a little bit on this game, people. Check it out. Thank me later."
5,so much fun!,"i havent enjoyed a video game since i was in highschool, i am now 27, i bought this game as a gift for my younger brother and thought, why not i will give it a shot. it is fantastic! Its been over 10 years since i actually looked forward to playing a video game, GTA4 is it!"
4,Probably a 4.5 star,"I think this game is great and most sites are giving it a 5 star or 10/10, but I am holding back that rating simply on the fact that this is more of the same.Now, with that being said, it is the same amount of fun and it is still awesome story, etc., but to me it feels more like a GTA III than a IV. Rockstar has added a lot of little things like extra animations to make it more fluid and more lifelike (simple things like walking up and down stairs, lighting effects with street lights to cell phone integration so you can choose when to start missions, etc.)This is a really fun game and I will probably spend way too much time on my 360 playing it, but if you are expecting something completely different or advanced from GTA III, then you might, and I stress might, be disappointed.Still fun to play and probably will be best game of the year."
5,Great,"still the best game ive played in a longtime, some people dislikes it but its your option i wont blame you, but love this game..."
3,Grand Teft Auto 4 a time to kill,"This game is very interesting at the begining but with times it becomes kind of repetition of events, but it keeps anybody busy for a while."
4,GTA4 Rules!!!!,"I will keep my comments simple. For those who have never played the GTA series, this latest installment will blow you away!! I suggest playing Vice City and San Andreas first, then play GTA4 on an LCD TV last. I have a personal connection with GTA 4 because I'm originally from the Astoria section of Queens, NY. Let me tell ya, the attention to detail is amazing compared to NYC. The First thing I did before I started any missions or mayhem, was simply steal a convertible, and drive around the city. Times Square is awesome at night, and if you drive down by the Hudson river at dawn, you can catch a glimpse of the sun rising over Liberty City AKA Manhattan!! Unlike the cartoon-ish look of Vice City, which I enjoyed also, GTA4 has a very gritty, urban look which gives the player a sense of realism. I wish the twin towers were still standing, that would have been an awesome sight as well. Rockstar, has once again, out done themselves!!"
4,Fun Game,"I've always been a fan of the GTA series, and this one does not disappoint. I like all of the features included within the game and the graphics are amazing! Definitely a fun game for everyone, just wish there was a multiplayer without using XBox live."
1,Constantly Freezes!,"I would've given GTA 4 Four stars but every single time i play it it freezes, and a lot of ppl have had this problem. The things i don't like about the game is: No character costumization, no safehouses to buy, and missions are very repetitive and similar to previous GTA games."
2,Miss the cheats - too much freezing,"No more flying cars, parachutes, or jet packs to get around with. I used to spend hours just screwing around in San Andreas and was hoping for the same in Liberty City. Nothing left to do here but play the missions, which get boring after a while. In addition, freezing issues made it difficult to even play the game. It doesn't just freeze, it locks up the whole console so you have to reboot."
2,Kind of Boring and Hard to See Where You're Going,"I have not played previous GTAs, and perhaps I should have continued that behavior. I enjoy most types of games, and GTA is reminiscent of that pretty old game ""Police Quest"" in its various incarnations.I'm certain that this game is enjoyable for very young men and boys. But as for mature folks, it's frequently boring. Add to that the need to constantly check a map, which has teeny-weeny symbols showing you your location and destinations, it gives me a headache after less than an hour each time I play.So if you like driving irresponsibly and talking with a Greek accent while you ogle cartoon women and beat up cartoon men, this is a must-have. Otherwise, I recommend all of the ""Halos"", and/or a good RPG like ""Elder Scrolls"" instead."
2,The most overrated game I've played.,"I heard a lot of good from this game. So I decided to order it and try it myself. I usually had enjoyed some games that Rockstar had created, but I was very disappointed in the one. For one thing, the controls are horrible. Second of all you just go around mindlessly kill people. The campaign never made me get in-depth into the story.The reason it gets 2 stars is because of the alright graphics. If you want an open world game, get Just Cause 2 or Fallout 3."
2,Corrupted download,"got it for five dollars on digital download, which is nice. However, and this is a major however, twice I've downloaded it and not been able to install it. will keep trying as the pc mods for these games usually make it worthwhile.update: download did work, just be sure to get the 1.7 patch as this cleans up a fair amount of the problems many people have reported when playing this on windows 7. In adddition, I suggest you lower the vehicle density to below 30 as you can cause a traffic jam at higher levels."
2,Out of all the GTA'S this! is the worst one.,"Let me point out the flaws.1. you can't buy safe houses. which I thought was very lame.2. cell phone goes off. during a shoot out?3. who says ""ting"" and ""bloodclot"" NO RASTA SPEAKS LIKE THAT!4. the part I hate the most is lack of cheats! you can't have a million bucks if you wanted too.5. the cars and bikes flip if ou make sharp turns and barley any stores to shop for cloths. you can't find any good looking cloths.6. no hair cuts or tats.7/ NO HOT COFFEE SCENE?pass this game!"
2,Wow thought because of the reviews it was amazing,At first i thought the game was fun. it had some stuff from San Andreas like girl friends and other stuff. I am a girl and love GTA series so i thought that it was going to be amazing. First when i got it i was like its awesome and i wanted to play it because of coures its something new and i am a gamer. However the missions are way too easy. I don't need to heal. I have Mafia 2 and its so much better than this. The cars are not that great and the missions suck. I can't stand the main characters voice either. That being said since i am a gamer i will have to finish this sorry excuse for a game but my overall experience with it is its a bad buy. If you are interested in it rent first.
2,bitterly disappointing.,"Bitterly disappointed with this game i'm afraid. i used to play san andreas for literally years but after two days i'm sick of this game. it's just frustrating to play. the handling both when in cars and on foot is shocking, not realistic it's so bad you just get pissed off whenever you have to drive anywhere, and you have to drive everywhere. it feels slow, takes ages to set off again after stoping, when you do eventually stop, you have to use the handbrake to get around any corner and once you do it just sends the car into a slow slide that kills your speed and usually just slowly bounces you off a wall.the plot is monotonous and they've tried to cram the script with crappy jokes which would have a 8 year old giggling.pretty gutted the only fun thing on this game is the crashes and it takes so long to actually get your car up to speed it's not even worth it. pretty graphics - balls game."
4,After all is said and done the game has good replay ability,Best thing about this game is two for the price of one single player and multiplayer for the first real time excellent and the bonus add ons like Lost or Damned and the upcoming add on Gay one that's games should do make you want to keep playing them not finish and forget.
4,Another Great GTA Game,"Another great GTA game. A little too linear; you basically follow a prescripted path to complete missions and follow the story, but still very fun."
4,Its cool,"I cant see how every game reviewer is giving this game a perfect score. It is fun, but it still has many of the same annoying control issues/glitches you find in prior GTA's. Also, the multiplayer is nothing to brag about. The pregame/matchmaking system is horrible. It often freezes, and its hard rare that you ever get a full match where everyone knows what they're doing. It definatley does not compare to the fun and competion of Halo 3 or COD 4.The single player mode however is extremly fun and entertaining. The depth is amazing, from browsing the internet and checking email, to browsing the police car laptop database to find people you need to kill.This is definatley a must have title. Altough its close, it just dosent live up to the hype of a ""perfect"" game for me."
4,One of the best purchases ever!!!!,"Before I had bought a crappy disk from gamestop that was faulty and would send me into the map and screw up the graphics so the game play and value was absolutely down the drain. So then I bought the game off of amazon and I absolutely loved the graphics, story and everything. I could not put down this game for my life, so if you are debating about getting it or not the debate is over GET IT!"
4,Overall good game,"This game has great graphics and is definetly worth checking out. I would not consider the story to be anywhere near the same level as San Andreas or Vice City, but the gameplay and the graphics are exceptionally good."
5,Best GTA Game Yet!,"This is honestly the best Grand Theft Auto game I have played so far. The graphics are better than expected, as well as how realistic the game is. I felt as if the game was so much more interactive compared to the previous games.The storyline of the game is absolutely fantastic, and you feel like you can really connect with the character. Overall, this game is really great and there are very few things I would change about it. I can't wait to see what Rockstar Games has in store for us GTA gamers!"
4,More Realistic Then Older GTA's,"GTA4 didn't disappoint me with it's gritty realism. I think I will be playing the game for years to come, just like how I still play GTA: 3/VC/SA every now and then.There are some small differences between GTA3 engine renditions and this new GTA4. These ""small"" differences make a huge difference to the overall experisance. You don't play GTA4 to go on a rampage without any guns and expect to survive for very long at all. You don't drive full speed through the city in GTA4 and expect to survive for very long (you will fly right out your windshield if you aren't careful and it will hurt).GTA4 has lost a lot of the ""rampage"" feel to it, but the added realism makes it fun in it's own way. (try Saints Row 2 if you want a rampage game)."
2,Bought this game and cant play it,"I bought this for my girlfriend overseas and she cant play it because its region locked. I do not see anywhere clearly marked that this is a fact for if I did I would have never bought it in the first place. This is why people pirate games, You buy it legit and half the time you can't even play it while a cracked version you can play anywhere."
1,suckes,"You cannot fly planes,small city,horrible car control. Just wait until san andreas stories comes out (if it does)."
4,Good,"Good, but loses itself in the end. Some of the side quests are quite ridiculous, and I miss the more story oriented previous GTAs - as opposed to these shoot around, john woo types. It has its merits, but overall if you enjoy a story, you won't get it"
4,Good game,First time playing video games. Luv it. Graphics are amazing. So life like. Once u get control of the console its a breeze.
5,I would recommend buying games on here.,I loved that fact that it came on the date it says it was going to because I was getting this for my friend and she was anxious about getting it. It was packaged nicely.
5,Best game ever played for xbox 360.,"Out of all the games I have purchased and sold, this game has remained with me for over 3 years. The DLC continue on the fun, but the main concept and gameplay allow for hours upon hours of gameplay. Highly reccomended (anything by rockstar really)."
4,my 14 y.o. son seems to like it,"he plays online with a couple of his friends. you have to know it is ""violent"" for a game and remember it is a GAME. just remember that while you're running from cops for stealing cars and shooting people on the streets. don't take it too seriously and it's kinda funny."
5,"Yeah, Just Get It.","Except for having to replay some missions over and over this is a great game. You really get to know the city and its people. Graphics are great. Believe the hype, it will grab and hold your interest."
4,GTA 4 is addicting! Had freezing issues. Amazon.com is amazing!,"I can't wait to get home and play GTA 4. Such a well-rounded game and worth the purchase. I did have some of those freezing issues that some are having. However, Amazon.com didn't even hesitate and sent me another copy with 2-day shipping...I love Amazon.com If I have any problems with the new copy then I know Amazon will take care of it."
3,HIGHLY OVER-RATED!!!,"The terrible steering on the cars is back! Not to mention your character ""runs"" in snail mode. The fighting is the absolute worst, takes you about 2 minutes to knock your opponent out cold. This game is literally like playing unreleased missions of old Grand Theft Auto games. Instead of taking a step forward like they did with San Andreas, they took a step to the side and made another cliche Grand Theft Auto. Looks like the GTA series will finally meet its match when Saintsrow 2 comes out, not to mention the fact they stole the cellphone concept from Saintsrow."
1,Games are only fun when you can PLAY them.,"I received a pretty good looking case, complete with all it's original manuals and such. The disc didn't look too bad, but when I put it into my Xbox it would crash at the title screen every time. The funnest part of a game is being able to play it. :|"
1,Grant Theft Auto not for kids or adults it's horrible!,"I ordered Grand Theft Auto for my grandson, but I wish I had not! The actions, language, everything about it is horrible. I would like to ask for my money back for a comparable swap for something that is not so terrible!"
3,"Good game, NOT for everyone","I bought this game even though I never played any of the GTA games. I went on the fact that everyone in the field gave it a 10/10.I bought this game yesterday and sold it today on ebay. I guess it is not for me. The story is way too slow. I played for three hours and all I had done is drive all over hell's half acre, stole some cars, got into some fights and took some chick out on a date. I never touched a gun or did any cool missions.I guess this game is not for me, too slow."
1,mislead,"I bought this product was not aware, as it was not advertised, that the game does not work in this country.As i do not pocess a printer i was unable to print the labels you offered me to send it back for a refund.Please in future can you advertise that certain games only work on certain systems."
2,great game! when it works! unfortunatley it doesn't work so great!,"GTA 4 could have been classic! I tried to get into it, but I played a few missions and it froze. I checked the disc and it was fine. I returned the disc to Gamestop, and exchanged for another one, and the disc seemed better. So I thought it would work fine, but I was wrong! I did did the same thing! It froze AGAIN! Now I can see if this game didn't have this issue I would give it all the praise it deserves, but sorry Rockstar you ain't getting mine! Not with all the aggravation and tamdrums I've been through with this broken, overhyped game! I honestly have ask myself ""What on Earth is Rockstar Games Thinking?! And what was everybody thinking?!"" Is it the best in the GTA Series??!! NOT QUITE AT ALL!!!"
5,best one yet,Best GTA yet and not that sleazy. They need to have more music in the movie parts to fit the bill just like Vice City. Give it some old school taste to it. Also not many voice overs that I have recognized yet. Gary Busy was hilarious. Have not played it that much but will be soon.
5,Sons Xbox 360,"Son love it he says it works fine , so what eles can I say but it is still working as of today"
5,Awesome!,"These game are insane! ""There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love."" 1 John 4:18"
5,Very Comfy,I got these for my husband who always complains of sore feet. He has wide feet with a high arch so finding comfortable shoes is always a chore. He loved his crocs! They fit him perfectly and can walk all day in them without any pain or sore ankles. They have a cushy heal as well so it helps your back too. I went out and got a pair for myself!
2,squeeky crocs,They are crocs and they are nice - but they make alot of noice when you walk = the straps squeak
3,"Like all box sets, sometimes less is more","Despite the impressive line up--Rush, Turner, Magic Sam--I do wish that I had just the essential recordings of each of these top musicians. I'd be happy with one version of Otis singing ""I Can't Quit You Baby."" There is great early material for the completists--the musicianship is just brilliant. Sometimes in my fantasy world, I wish that the engineers who were able to make a clean recording of Dylan at the Gaslight didn't devote their time to great recordings like these: Clean up the sound of other important American music."
3,"no doubt, some talented folks, but...","Hey, absolutely, some greats: Willie Dixon as A&R man, Otis Rush, Magic Sam, Ike Turner, Shakey Horton, Sunnyland Slim...it's an impressive list. One problem: most of these sides were recorded at Cobra Studios, which, from the sound of it, must have been a converted garage. The cuts that were cut at actual Chicago studios sound great, but they're few and far between, and mostly the lessor artists in this set. Most of the cuts by Rush, Magic Sam, Shakey Horton, etc. were cut at Cobra Studios and sound wretched.So, buyer beware. If you're looking for great Chicago blues, Chess is still the place to be."
2,Not useful,"I was looking forward to using what I learned from this book to implement balanced scorecard strategy with my small business clients. There is so little useful information, I didn't even finish reading the book. The last chapter and appendix are literally the only portions I found helpful. Look elsewhere."
4,A Good Read but One Size does Not Fit All,"The world doesn't need another long review of this book or the Balanced Scorecard concept but a little added perspective might be of value. BSC is most useful to organizations that need to jump start (or begin) their strategic planning efforts. The book lays out a practical and useful guide to do just that but many companies end up allowing BSC to become all consuming and not a means to an end. For this and other reasons, the majority of organizations don't follow through. The process described in this book is easy to read and absorb and consequently has a loyal following of adherents -- some of whom claim substantive results in their companies as a result. With the caveat that one size does not fit all, I would recommend this book as a component of your readings on business strategy and execution."
5,Common sense thoughtfully organized,"Any business could benefit from the thoughtful approach to strategic planning outlined in this book.Define success - identify the customers and their needs require to achieve that success - build the internal process to satisfy those customers - and provide the learning and growth necessary for people to make a quantum leap in performance.This process is good common sense, well organized. I have given several copies away to associates"
2,"A common sense, super hard reading, marketing ploy?","I have read tomes of quantum theory that were easier to read. I find myself going back over and over single sentences, which are half page long. The idea of putting actual strategy, steps & measurements behind a corporate vision is nothing new. I fear this book was more to guide executives toward consulting services, then to contribute to corporate welfare."
1,What's the agenda?,"OK, so strategy consultants suffer from the 'strategy-of-the-week' syndrome and forget to implement. Great managers know this and that's why they boot consultants out after a couple of months or so. However the Balanced Scorecard isn't a recipe for how to implement so much as a book-long brief for a large consultancy project. Treat with caution."
1,"Pure, Unadulterated Drivel....","Not only that, but it is written in a style that will make your want to scream! I'd quote sentences that make up entire paragraphs, but if you like this sort of writing, read James Joyce. I think these guys must also contract out as government rule writers, because governmental rules are the only printed materials I have ever seen that resemble the prolixity to be found here.But prolixity does not indicate profundity. Once one fights through the Harvard-educated prose (Harvard should be ashamed!), this is a very simplistic set of ideas. Many different forces and fields of endeavor feed the bottom line, so one has to strategically pay attention to all of them to enhance the bottom line. There! One sentence! Not so difficult. But you won't believe it after having wasted your time with this one.What ever you do, don't give this book to your employees. After wrestling through the first chapter, they are likely to call in sick."
2,OK,"The book is somewhat helpful, but given the current conditions, it is no longer applicable. I would rather go for the new book Six Sigma Business Scorecard, which is a surprisingly good modification and has a new revolutionary theme to it."
3,Heavy Reading,"TOn one hand,this book is very informative, especially on the topic of business competition in the information age. On the other hand, the material is heavy and difficult to follow if you are new to the territory. In fact, this book is so jammed with information, though. I recommend wading through it twice,or pick up Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine.The content is similar but more direct."
5,Continuous improvement with a feed-forward approach,The measurement of the enterprise performances is today more and more important for business units and their management. To provide a real balanced growth of your enterprise I suggest to every kind of manager to read carefully this book. I'm sure you'll find a new way to design your business or to clarify where are you going to. Don't miss it.
1,These are simple business ideas dressed up,"I read the initial Harvard Business Review article years ago and was excited about the concepts. Rushed out to buy the book when it was first available. What a disappointment! This book is little more than business 101: aligning objectives, strategies, tactics with employee work. Important? Yes. Unique? No."
5,Finding the Leverage Points,"Kaplan and Norton's book establishes the pathways to develop not only a superb strategic management system but an effective strategic communication system as well. In every business those two enterprises are co-dependant and are key to effective strategies being effectively realized. Those looking for the trendy business ""idea d'jour"" should look elsewhere; the BSC focuses on practical methods and measures to move strategy into sustainable operational actions. While the Balanced Scorecard may not transform your organization, it can give you the competitive advantage needed to prevail in your market. The book is very readable and gives a comprehensive overview of the processes involved."
2,redundant -- go back to the article,"The book rehashes the article for an extra couple hundred pages. I've got this book on the shelf, but when I want to talk about the Balanced Score Card concept, I go back to the article."
5,Mechanics and Case Studies,"This book has both, written by the man who brought the Balanced Scorecard to corporate America. If you are thinking of implementing the balanced scorecard as a way of relaying, measuring and refining your company strategy, read this book first!"
4,"Key Insights For Executives, Change Agents and Consultants","A much needed overview of why companies (and organizations) need a strategy linked to performance measures in a way that communciates the strategy throughout the organization. As much as I liked ""The Balanced Scorecard"" it is not as complete in the area of operations implimentation as I need when working with clients. I've found an excellent reference for operations managers to be ""Operational Performance Measurement: Increasing Total Productivity"" by Will Kaydos. Executives get the Scorecard, operations managers need different insight to make it work for them."
5,"Necessary reading, and imperative implementation","Balanced Scorecard delivers what it promises: a bridge between strategic goals and performance monitoring. As a strategy consultant I highly recommend it -- not because it offers a canned strategic solution (it doesn't), but because when executives think deeply enough about strategy to examine implementation and organizational alignment, strategies get much better, productive and successful. And they even get communicated outside of the executive office! I consider this book necessary (though not sufficient) for any company who wants their strategic planning to pay off."
5,Recommended by my doctor,"When I started EMT school several years ago, I had to have a physical. I went to my doc and during the exam, I asked him about stethoscopes. I reminded him that I was a student, so my budget wasn't very large. He flipped his scope over and I saw that it was the Prestige Clinical I. He got his after his expensive Littman was stolen in the hospital on rounds. He jetted into a nursing uniform shop and picked his up. That was about 8 years before I saw him. I went out and bought the same one (about $40 at the time). I have never regretted it. My classmates liked it better than their Littmans, my instructors lusted after it and bought their own, and very few people will steal them because they want the Littman name. It is very comfortable, durable, great sound quality and excellent value. If you are just starting out or are an old pro, I highly recommend this scope. My doc owns his practice and has the budget to buy whatever he wants, but he has yet to change from his Prestige."
4,You get what pay for...,"I bought this scope to use for blood pressure and apical pulse measurements. It does the job just fine in my opinion. I probably wouldn't recommend this scope for anything much more advanced than that. This is my first stethoscope, and I have to admit I spent a good 20 minutes playing with it and trying to adjust the earpieces before I figured everything out without instructions. The picture shows earpieces that look fairly straight but they are actually very angled and not really adjustable. For the price, I think it is a worthy scope, and I feel comfortable recommending it to CNAs and CNA students. I just wish that it was more adjustable and came with more detailed instructions."
2,Quite disappointing,"I am really disappointed with this stethoscope. During assessments, I find it difficult to hear heart and lung sounds with, which is what I need it most for! This is even when there is relative silence all around. Imagine how difficult it is in the clinical setting. Compared to a Littman, there is no comparison, even though it does look a lot like one. If I could do it over, I'd invest the money in the Littman instead! I totally feel like I've just thrown $30 down the toilet. :( There's a reason the Littman's are popular! Um...they work!"
2,good news/bad news,"I rec'd this in the mail last week. I immediately opened it up and tried it out on myself and was thrilled with the sound sensitivity, particularly considering the price. But, the ear tubing wasn't angled quite right for me and I found myself having to hold it in a particular position for optimal sound. As I have many times with other stethoscopes in the past over 35 years of practice, I turned the tubing a slight bit to adjust the angle of the earpieces; this disconnected the tubing inside, rendering the entire instrument useless. Needless to say I will return it and try another model."
3,Trumpet,The Trumpet Game is fun. I would recommend it to people who like to play games. The game I received is in good shape. It arrived in a timely manner.
1,Not Worth $1.00!!!,"I thought this was going to be so cute to have on my desk in my office, but it never kept time. It lost over an hour a day (several minutes an hour) and I had to keep resetting. Changed brand new batteries three times and it would just time any time the wrong time would display. I plugged two power cords in and it didn't keep the time, but I was too busy to take the time to return it, so I am out the money. I took the batteries out and threw it in a drawer. I'll probably take the fishing line out from the hanging chimes and make my own windchime to put on my patio. Extremely cheap quality plastic. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
1,Big Disappointment,"Please don't waste your money! It's hard to imagine how such a simple-appearing clock could be so complicated! The instructions are senseless and bizarre, so I had to figure things out on my own. It isn't obvious which ""mode"" the clock is in, and you have to switch back and forth between several buttons to set it, so setting it becomes a task. Also you have to be careful to set the clock on ""auto"" rather than ""alarm"" using a small switch so it's hard to discern.There's no power cord, although you can pay another $10 for one if you want to add that to your investment. The batteries run down quickly and then - no alarm goes off! Very disappointing. I am returning this asap."
2,"Works for about a year, somewhat","It's a great idea, but the chimes will stop working 9mos-1yr after you purchase it. The buzzer will still work and it's not too loud. Getting it set up, doesn't work very well.... cheap. If you wanted to buy this every year for $20 to wake up to wind chimes in the morn, than it will work for you, but don't expect it to last any longer than that."
5,Francesca Marciano's Italy,"As excellent as her first bookRules of the Wild: A Novel of Africa, I think of Francesca every time I pop the cork on an Italian Red. If only we could tap glasses across the table... Bravo! Ciao, Rudy Waldner, author ofMarketing from the Trenches: Your Guide to Retail Success"
5,Este libro no es un lujo,"SINO UNA NECESIDAD !¬°URGENTE !, p√≤rque HOY mismo, estamos comiendo alimentos que nos sirven para que se nos dispare un ONCOGENE, o sea, una c√®lula de c√†ncer !"
4,Perfect for busy lives,"A very easy reading book, with short chapters (ideal for busy people late at night)that's easy to pick up. The story is uncomplicated, contains life lessons most people can relate to and bounds along at a lovely pace. I enjoyed it so much I bought his other books too."
5,How Timely...,"I can't imagine any station in live that wouldn't be enhanced by reading and applying the paridigm shifts Ben Patterson leads us through in WAITING. Those who are barren couples, widows, and single mothers, people with chronic illness; or, like me, simply looking for career fullfillment & hoping to meet and marry a Godly spouse...the list goes on. WAITING speaks to us all, with an honest, sober clarity I've not seen in related works. It presents the scriptures on Job and Abraham in a fresh light, with provoking applications that touch our own daily struggles with tender care, yet leave us humbled. We are encouraged to turn our gaze to the magnitude of God and away from our own desires. If you wonder what is taking the Good Lord so long to attend to you, or if you know anyone who has been hurting for too long, this book will minister. (Other suggested titles: TURN IT TO GOLD, GOD CALLING, GOD IS ENOUGH, SAFER THAN A KNOWN WAY, SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY, PASSION AND PURITY)"
2,"No, it isn't THAT good and not worth the expense",Just a heads up for all you researchers out there...This book is a good book with several good layouts but it is WAY to expensive to justify the material when there is another book out there that is vastly superior. And though this $100.00 book alone is dedicated to the development of the Essex class aircraft carrier I found FAR more material and details about the Essex carrier in Norman Friedman's U.S. Aircraft Carriers. And Friedman's U.S. Aircraft Carriers covers them ALL and at half the cost. Don't spend the money!
2,Great...when it works,"I actually have the Que!Fire 8x8x32 CDRW burner. It worked wonderfully with my iMac (Mac OS 9.0.4) for about a month or so. However, then Toast (which was included) began having trouble recognizing the drive. Now the drive isn't recognized at all, and the burner simply won't work. And with the exception of their website, QPS tech support doesn't seem to exist. I've tried everything the website suggests and nothing fixed the problem."
3,Firewire cord dilema,I just recieved this drive only to find that the included cord would not plug into my Inspiron 8000. I don't know much about computers so this had my scatching my head for a while. Turns out that they sent me a 6/6 plug and I needed a 6/4 plug. I am now ordering the correct plug but am dissipointed about not getting to use the drive yet....
1,QPS will not give you any help with the product,QPS is not answering my request for help with my controller card
2,"Great burner, but sketchy power supply!!","This CDRW is great when it goes. No coasters after about 5 months. (500+burns) Unfortunately it is powered by a dirty filthy Rexon power supply. This has made it increasingly unreliable, to the point where it sometimes takes 10-15mins just to get the drive to be recognised. Buy something else which is more stable."
2,A WindowsXP nightmare,This unit will not function with WindowsXP even though there is a patch for the software provided.
5,Controller card?,This item does look great. But what is a controller card? What does it do? If anyone can answer my question e-mail me at murfy2u@yahoo.com
1,Ignorantes,"Gracias a Dios que man√° no toca reguet√≥n, como lo dice el ingnorante que escibi√≥ el Editorial Review (en espa√±ol) por un momento me imagine a los integrantes con cadenas en el cuello y actuando como changos.
