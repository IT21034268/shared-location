1,"""Mind""-numbingly Atrocious.","Don't be fooled by the book that he got,He stillHe stillEston who writes schlock.Pop culture references aside, after reading this transparent ""treatise on the metaphysical cerebellum"" as he puts it, the reader will think he or she has just consumed a delectable mock epic satirizing literary pomposity. Tragically, it is Eston's illusions of grandeur that is the only thing laughable.For shame, Luther.For shame."
1,You've been Tex Mex'd,"This attempt at literature is beyond a disappointment. As the author tries to assist the athlete in getting in the proper mindset for athletic performance, the reader is left chuckling at the pathetic Luther, instead.For those that were fortunate to not know Eston personally, this book reveals his flawed characteristics as an exaggerator with a warped sense of thinking. For those who were less fortunate to know him, this book confirms his persona.Long story short... Eston lived in our dorm in college and one night we had a chef come over and cook a fantastic Tex-Mex dinner for the house. Instead of consuming this delicious food, I decided to launch my nachos and enchiladas at his door and wasn't finished until I painted his door with guacamole and sour cream. When asked by him as to why I did this, I told him he deserved it. 10 years later, I still feel like I did the right thing. This book is the end result of a Tex-Mex dinner combined with a laxative. A must not read."
4,Different,"'Flow Motion' has faced harsh criticisms and I can understand why. This album sounds like Can trying to be commercially accessible. But Holger's repeatedly mentioned in his interview that it was due to the band's interest in reggae music at that time. This album still retains some of Can's whimsical/weird attributes but at the same time the music has a wider appeal. I am a huge fan of reggae as well, so I personally enjoyed this CD(even the almost dance groove of 'I want more'). Just don't expect this to resemble Tago Mago or any of their old Albums. And by the way, one of the reviewers Dean Taylor, claimed that David Gilmour co-wrote 'I Want More'; it was 'Peter Gilmour'."
3,Can - 'Flow Motion' (Mute),"Originally released in 1976, as this is probably the Can effort that I favor the least. However, it's reportedly to have been their most commercially successfully album ever. Even had the disco-like opening track ""I Want More"" made the charts in the UK. Go figure. The reggae-ish ""Laugh 'Til You Cry"" most certainly caught me off guard. The only cut here I actually liked is the ten minute title track ""Flow Motion"" (which is 'almost' worth the admission price, I guess). Now THAT'S the old Can that I know. See how you like this catalog title."
2,fair,"Ahhhhhh.....ok. This is not what I would expect from German revolutionaries who funkified prog with albums likeTago MagoandEge Bamyasi.This was much later in the game. And I would not demand Can make the albums in the dance music world of the late 1970s they did in the hothouse of 1971 prog apex.Damo was long gone by the time Flow Motion flowed around, but this is hardly the point. Can made what some argue is their best work without the improvisation demon, such asSoon Over Babaluma.But Flow Motion seems patched together: some do-wop reggae, some ok dance, some vaguely avant pieces. But they seem to be imposing ideas on music here as opposed to organically inventing as they worked, as on earlier albums. They sound more Can-influenced than they do Can.Even if you put this in the context of 1970s dance and new wave, there were lots of bands doing this music in far more interesting ways, and for Can, that is falling off a cliff..Time to call it a revolution."
3,Can goes disco?,"This is the second album in the slow decline toward Can's breakup in the late 70s. While this did contain a UK hit in the form of the disco-inflected track 'I Want More', it cannot be denied that something's amiss here. The fluid feel found on previous releases is missing throughout much of the album, save perhaps for on 'Smoke' and the sweeping and beautiful title track, which serves as a reminder of what Can was capable of. And tracks like 'Cascade Waltz' and 'Laugh Til You Cry...' make one wonder ""what the hell were they thinking?"". If you're into Can, buy this, as beyond here it gets difficult. But otherwise, this is a dodgy piece of work, with only half of it being very much like the Can of legend."
4,Good Read,"While this may not be a read for everyone, as a psychologist and college instructor I found it quite interesting. It gives one a better understanding of crime- why it happens and to whom. There are many theories out there- but this book combined them altogether in one place."
2,J fletcher II,"A little bit over the top. No need to link a tragedy with greek life. It is not ""School Daze""...Best part of the movie was the ""step show"".. The rest of the movie left little to be desired..."
1,Hated IT!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't waste your money on this DVD. No statement, no setting and no plot. It was just a film about what? Some frat steppings and no soror stepping."
2,yellow disc coral,"This peice looked very fake, it was not solid yellow like in the picture it has orange paint sprayed on it. I did not put this in my tank. And it was very small."
2,index of classes,The book is an index of classes and procedures that will be class taught not a workbook or text.
4,Making the difficult possible,I bought this book for a friend but found I wanted my own copy. I am not keen on applique but like the finished results. This book showed me how to achieve the look I wanted but using piecing. A great book.
4,Great but can be pricey,"Make sure you get these at a lower price. That being said, they are durable and super comfy. I bought 3 for the women in my life, as well as one for me. Yes.... my wife, and my two mothers. Great for gardening, brick laying, patios, you name it."
4,Generous size for my generous thighs!!,"OMG, I'm so happy I found this kneeler. I admit, I'm a big girl, and some of those little foam knee pads were just too small for me to comfortably kneel on. But this bad boy is HUGE - big enough for both of my knees, with plenty of room to spare.My only complaint? I've only had it for 2 weeks, and both handles have already broken off. The handles are pretty flimsy, and both of them snapped off when I had the kneeler on the concrete sidewalk & tipped too far over to the side.Also, the plastic backing is pretty slippery on a tile floor. If you're going to use it for your little one's bathtime, make sure you pick up some non-skid tape to stick on the back."
4,Knee saver,We travel in a motorhome a lot and this item allows me to get down on my knees to do different repairs/fixes around the outside of the coach. It not only provides a nice soft surface to kneel on it also keeps my clothes clean as I am not kneeling on the ground.
5,Thank you Lord for the Rochesters.,"If you want your soul touched and spirit lifted, this is an album for you. Their message is clear, Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior. Their talents are truly God given. Thank you Rochesters for using your talents for the Lord."
5,Southern gospel,"This is another one of the Rochester family albums. They are a number one southern gospel, blue grass singing quartet. And more."
5,"Love it, love it, love it","Pleasant smell, nice thickness, and makes my skin smooth. Expensive, but I have found nothing as good. Lasts longer than you'd think, too."
5,A positive uplifting story that is much needed at this time.,"At certain times in the past few years, I have reflected on the message of hope I felt after reading this story of an ordinary man given an extraordinary mission. I would like to think that in some way, however small, I am a better person for having read this book. I am not particularly religous, but this has made more sense to me than all the teachings I received in Sunday school as a child. With all that is going on in this country, especially Washington, this message of hope and understanding is needed now more than ever. As stated by others, I am at a loss as to why this book is out of print. To the powers that be, please- reprint"
3,Decent potboiler,"OK thriller about Catholic intrigue and a ""Life of Brian""-esque story (sans humor) of an ordinary Joe discovering he's no. 2 in God's family. The plot keeps you entertained until the last third, but doesn't really take you anywhere. One other thing: somehow, I don't think that salvation of the world is going to come through wildcat strikes.Also, I have to agree with a prior reader that a lot of the five-star reviews look and feel like Spam. This book was not a particularly large seller and it's nearly 30 years old. I'm very skeptical of so many reviews at all, let alone so many five-star reviews. Someone's manipulating the system."
1,second son,I received the wrong book. I ordered The Second Son by Charles Sailor. I received Second Son by Nancy Faulkner. I am hoping I can get the right book sent to me at no additional cost. At this moment I do not know who to contact to do so.
1,Textbook case of review spam,"These reviews seem to have all been written by bogus people or friends. I went to the trouble of putting all the reviews in a pdf file so that I could search the talking points like ""best book I ever read,"", ""changed my life,"" ""loaned it to someone, wish it was in reprint so I could read it again,"", and especially ""where is the movie?"" Here is my question - which idiot movie producer would be convinced by such a pathetically transparent ploy to invest? This hasbeen hack tv writer should take a course in subtlelty at least, and forcing his teenage son to write a review approaches child abuse - what was he, grounded? The whole business reminds me of ""Naked Came the Stranger."""
5,Read this book whatever you do,"I was lent this book when I was just eleven years old, the copy having been passed around parents, friends and other family, and then finally back to its owner, a teacher at my school. I remember as if it was yesterday the moment when I finished the book and closed the cover.It was the most astonishing read and twenty years later it looks like I have finally laid my hands on a copy of my own. If you ever have the similar good fortune, seize the opportunity.The fact that Charles Sailor did not publish any more books, at least under that name, seems entirely apt and fitting. What an earth would one do for an encore?Fight for a copy."
5,The Sequel?,"I'm a big fan of THE SECOND SON, having owned various copies over the years. I don't own a Kindle, but have a nook. AND YES, THE SECOND SON is now on my nook! I want to make sure the book THE MAN WHO RODE THE TIGER will be on the B & N nook. Will it be an actual sequel with Joseph Turner in it? Contacr RVes799328@aol.com. Thank you."
3,I liked this book!,Coral and Jace are great charactors. I've read most of Linda's books and this is a very good book. Linda is my favourite author! Way to go Linda!
5,This Cd Keeps You Movin!,"Sharyn is from the Bay Area and was recently on the top radio station here. The snipets they played on the radio sounded great, and so I bought this cd. Her cd has been in my cd player ever since I got it! It's such a good cd to work out to, high energy with her beautiful voice. My favorite song on this album is ""New"". Her lyrics are outstanding! Overall, this is a really awesome cd, a sure hit with any one who likes high energy music. Go Shayrn!!!"
3,MANY TRICKS BUT NO PROCESS,"I have gone through half the book.The good part:Walks you through many areas step-by-step. Repeats steps in other excerises. You will learn a lot.The bad part:The book doesn't teach you a process from the making of a connection to processing a cube. I need to Extact, Transform, & Load, and then process a cube. The book teaches ETL. Try another book.TC"
2,jaws not parallel,"The rotation of jaws is stiff and also restricted so that they don't close in parallel fashion on the hose,"
5,KD Tools 145 Radiator Hose Pinch-Off Pliers,"I've had these KD 145 pinch off pliers for years and used them all the time for doing appliance service. They work great for things like pinching off drain lines on dishwashers and tub hoses on washing machines when working on the pump, etc. They have also come in handy numerous times for vacuum and fuel lines as well as radiator and heater hoses when working on my various cars and trucks over the years. The flat smooth jaws and spring loaded ratchet lever allow them to cinch down tightly and stay exactly where you put them without damaging the hose or flexible tubing. They can either be used to completely pinch off a line or to only partially close a line to temporarily restrict flow. The pliers will release easily by lightly squeezing the handles and pushing forward on the latch with your thumb at the same time. Overall, I think these pliers are well made and definitely worth the price, so would have no problem recommending them."
3,So Silly,Plains Indians in Newfoundland? It was fun watching and a perfect New Year's Eve movie. Netflix was not working as ya'll probably know.
3,Dancing Pumpkin....,It's good ( for really only watching really at halloween time) and there are better movies. Not the best movie at all!
5,Works great.,"I never trust bus-powering in critical situations, so I bought this unit to use with the Canopus ADVC110. My company was producing a webcast for a large corporation, and their IT people said they could accept a firewire input for their Windows computer hosting the WebEx. We had two cameras and a DVD player routed into a video switcher and then sent the switcher's S-VHS video signal to the Canopus. It worked flawlessly."
5,PERFECT PIECE FOR ME!,Needed this piece to make our church streaming video setup work. THIS DID THE TRICK!!! I have used Canopus converters for a while now and have nothing but perfect results. This item is only needed if you are not using firewire setup.
2,"Big on science, but not much of a biography","I've been a fan of Carl Sagan's popularization of science since the ""Cosmos"" days. I agree he wasn't the most brilliant scientist around, but he did more to make people interested in astronomy than any scientist of his generation and beyond.This biography goes way too far into the scientific realm, but doesn't tell me much about Sagan as a man. As a student of astrophysics (a hobby, not a career for me), I found the science interesting, but it wasn't why I bought this book."
4,"Good, but a little shallow","This is a very readable biography of astronomer Carl Sagan. Although he did a poor job on Sagan's childhood, the author dug up a wealth of interesting facts about his life. The one problem I had with this book was that Poundstone ignored the ""themes"" that reappeared throughout Sagan's life, or at least didn't point them out. Read along with Keay Davidson's biography of Sagan, which has fewer facts but more connections."
3,Interesting but not well organized,"The book is interesting and worth reading, but the organization is poor. Sagan's life is presented in chronological order, but there are several themes running through the book and they are not integrated togethor very well. It is almost like cutting up 3-4 books and taping them together into a single book."
5,Nice,These earrings are lovely. I bought them for my mother and I know she will love them also. Excellent price for the product.
3,Great Book for Cooking!,"Excellent book for cooking hamburger. Many great ideas for those on a budget, especially now in this down economy. My only criticism, which is why it only got 3 stars, is that it was advertised as ""New"" but it was not. I could tell it had been out of any type of protective wrapper for quite a while and had been on a shelf where it had been taken out and back several times. The slight wear on the edges is unmistakable. The item was shipped in a timely manner."
3,Information is Power,"Like Mr. Nadin's former job, this book is fast paced, and harrowing. While it suffers a bit in terms of continuity, it more than makes up for it in details and facts. His story is nothing new, just one more 'regular' Joe who has had to suffer the injustices heaped upon the common, working family by a corrupt system. His story is another fine example of the misinformation and inappropriate use of power that is used by our police and politicians alike to exercise their control over the masses. Buy this book."
3,Enclosed Blind for Steel Doors,"I previously purchased this same product from the same company. I found this one not to be of the same quality as the previous. I had to send it back because of problems and the company was excellent in their customer service. However, I still have a problem with the replacement."
1,Another book that has the soulmate myth in its midst,"If I hear the word ""soulmate"" one more time, I will scream. That is the most stupid idea I have ever heard of...Somewhere out there is ""the other half of your being""...So Im walking around right now only 1/2 half and I dont even know it...or maybe Im 1/2 emtpy, depending on my mood. This book says ""you too can meet and attract your soulmate""...it is chalk full of the traditional crap...err new age ideology. This is a waste of your time, if you want to find your soulmate, the only place to look is in the mirror."
1,I didn't receive the product,"After a month waiting for the order, and lots of massages to Circuit City, I received the infirmation that the product had returned to their deposit. So, I canceled the order and bought another one (Elite), directly from Amazon. It was received in two days...About Circuit City, at least I received the information that I will get a full refound."
2,Burdensome,I found it very burdensome to read this book for the simple reason that the author chose not to use quotation marks for any of the dialogue. I found myself constantly backtracking to figure out if a character had said the sentence I'd just read or if they just thought it or if it was part of the narrative. That really disrupts the flow of such a quiet book. I found the characters distant and didn't feel much affection for any of them. The characters seemed to wander in and out of the storyline without much interest.It's definitely an interesting period of history to set a novel but the impact of such momentous current events seemed detached from the characters.
4,Two lives and another,"The lives of the parents were so intreguing. But I wondered about the child. I know it doesn't make a difference, but I was left curious.Mary"
2,The Allman Brothers without Dickey Betts?,"First let me say that everyone in this band is pretty good. But how could you buy an Allman Brothers album that doesn't have Dickey Betts on it? Their artistic abilities are very limited without Dickey around, that's why they did so many covers on this album (when was the last they covered this many songs on an album.)Greg was on the radio saying that they kicked Dickey out because he did too much drugs now and he can't play anymore, well let me tell you that is not true. I saw Dickey in towson the other day and he was tearing it up!I very much recomend to you that you pick up an album by 'Dickey Betts and the Great Southern.' The Allman Brothers with out Dickey is like Lynyrd Skynyrd without Ronnie Van Zant!"
4,Another Worthy Live Album,"Could there possibly be a reason for another live Allman Brothers release? The answer to that question is ""absolutely""! Springtime at the Beacon Theatre is an annual ritual and ""One Way Out"" catches them on fire. I can't say enough about the guitar tandem of Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks. A lot of bands can't claim even one guitarist who can match Haynes and Trucks lick for lick. The best reason for buying this album is the live versions of the ""Hittin The Note"" material. ""Desdemona"" and ""Instrumental Illness"" stand out in particular. Dip your hands in your pockets and shell out the coins for this one. It'll prove to you that the Allman Brothers are still one of the greatest American bands."
4,Really Peakin' !!!,"This set stands head and shoulders above the last release from the Beacon Theatre. Warren & Derek have really gelled and shows here, particularly on the new tunes which absolutely smoke! The sound quality is exceprtional as well. Nary a weak moment on this release. A must have for new and veteran Allmans fans alkie."
4,amazing but predictable,"One of the best lineups of this legendary band, the playing is second to none and the sound quality is amazing. My only complaint is the same as the first reviewer, the song selection is quite disapointing to say the least. Having seen two shows from the 2003 tour and hearing them play Layla and Into The Mystic,I figured at least Layla would make the cut. Other than that, Greg has NEVER sounded better, Warren and Derek are on fire, Oteil is a machine and Butch, Jaimoe and Marc are untouchable. This is a great CD but the track selection could have been better."
5,Don`t overlook this Allman Brothers Band classic!,"I did`nt pick this up when it was released because I had the Beacon Theatre 2003 dvd release.There are 6 songs on the dvd that are on both the dvd and cd,but they are different mixes or performances.I would say approvimately 9 songs that grace the cds (One way out),are`nt on the Beacon Theatre 2003 release....they are two different animals as they say.Now after hearing the cds of the 2003 Beacon theatre (One way out),I realize I had been missing something.Better late than never."
4,An undiscovered gem,"I have owned this CD for years but never REALLY listened to it until I heard them do ""Disconnected"" and ""Everybody lay down"" in concert, both of those songs rock like nothing she ever has done. I gave it a spin and discovered ""Somebody's baby"" could have been a top 40 hit. Tradin' down, Ties that bind both SMOKE! This is different in the aspect that it is LOUDER and HEAVIER than Pat and Neil usually do, I don't think the exec's knew how to market it. For the price this is worth the dough as long as your not looking for them doing blues or pop. THIS ROCKS!!!"
2,GRAVITY'S RAIN'BLAH'......,"I love Pat Benatar's music, even when she wants to veer off from 'typical' PB sound... I loved all her albums to some degree or other from 1979 to 1988... TRUE LOVE is alright and her voice is truly amazing BUT it wasn't my 'kind' of music so I got a bit tired of that CD real quick... GRAVITY'S RAINBOW has some good points like SOMEBODY'S BABY, EVERYONE LAY DOWN, CRAZY, YOU AND I and EVERY TIME I FALL BACK but the rest though not awful, by any means, just seems like a poor attempt to recapture the hard rockin' songs she is known for in the past but this time it falls flat... This is the album I listen to the least, with exception to the above mentioned songs... Her following album, INAMMORATA, is 100 times better and prettier so spend your dough on that effort... Not awful, but not that good either... BUT Pat is still considered, in my opinion, the best singer from the 80's and she gets better, though, even if some of her 90's efforts are less than stellar..."
5,"Too much, too late","This is an exceptional album that was fated to disappear into the vacuum of a music industry for whom Benatar was already old news in 1993. And that's too bad, as ""Gravity's Rainbow"" documents the solid music evolution that carried Benatar and Neil Giraldo through the early pre-fab hit fodder and through the more personal excursions of their later works. An excellent and hard-edged balance of the styles and influences that filter through much of Benatar's work, and well worth experiencing."
2,"A return to rock, but not like the 80's.","""Gravity's Rainbow"" is Pat's 9th studio release, but it just seems Pat and Neil can't get back on the tracks. After the blues failure of ""True Love"", they thought let's go back to what we know, only the material isn't as strong like the 80's. I found a few songs worth a listen in the mid-tempo rocker ""Somebody's Baby"", ""Everybody Lay Down"" #3 mainstream rock and ""Tradin' Down"". Four years would pass until ""Innamorata"" would come out."
5,It works,It works with no problems. This works for a quick clean of the bore. You still have to take the firearm apart to clean the rest of it.
4,Quick and Clean,"Bought this for my M1A. Very easy to run thorough the gun but does not take out as much dirt as I thought it would, still a great tool for you cleaning kit."
5,So easy,Fantastic!! This is the best & easiest method for cleaning a rifle that I have ever used. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. You will not be disappointed!
4,boresnake,just got it to day from nw sportsmans show for my 10/22 ruger fits a litel snug but works good vary clean
1,These blow,"Both of the .17HMR and the .22, that I bought, broke off while pulling them through the bore. NOT GOOD HOPPES!"
1,worthless,The cord broke the first time i attempted to run it thru my savage 17 mach 2.Don`t waste your money on this.
4,Awesome,Works great. Cuts down cleaning time on my Mosin Nagant tenfold. Just soak the part before the brush and pull through a few times. Clean as a whistle. Wash when it gets dirty. Easy peasy. Took one star off as i hear there is a version that has a cotton swab at the end but i still love it.
5,Works as advertised.,"I own these in 9mm, .22LR, 12/20 gauge, 7.62...etc, etc.Like many, I'm still surprised how easy this is, and don't know if powder has improved this much or this is that good. I have a feeling its a little of both.I could write a huge review of how great these are but there simply isn't much to say. They do that good of a job.Take the leap...spend the $20...you will be impressed."
5,Just what I needed,"Works perfect on my Gamo Whisper. Takes a little shake to get down past the baffles, but cleans it up in moments. I had some other cleaning equipment but I put them away after trying this. No worries about damaging the rifle when I use the .177 air rifle boresnake."
5,Boresnake Is The Best Invention,I've used a Boresnake for a few years now and I think they are the simplest and most efficient way to keep your guns clean. I highly recommend Boresnake to anyone that has a firearm. If you try it you'll never go back to the rod 'n patch method of cleaning your bore.
4,Pretty good cleaning device,"These are good for cleaning your barrel right after you shoot. Dont expect them to get all of the carbon out of a barrel though if you let your gun sit for a while, to get a barrel really clean you will have to run a brass barrel brush though it and some patches with cleaner, then follow up with this thing afterwards. Overall a good product, easy to use and 80% affective at removing debris/carbon buildup in a barrel."
2,"Doesent really fit an AK47 , 7.62x39 cal.","it doesent fit, or at least not thick enough to really clean the AK47 bore, even when fully soaking it in cleaner and fully dry it goes through but not tight enough feel to really clean or pull all the crap from the barrell, at least doesent feel that way, comes out very very easily."
5,Boresnake,"This made cleaning my tactical weapon a breeze. It's quick, efficient, and does a thorough job with just a couple of pull-throughs."
4,Snake too fat for the 22.,"I bought two snakes. One for a .17 and another for a .22. The .17 works fine,however, the one for the .22 would not fit my rifle. I use the .17 for both rifles."
1,Don't purchase for 22 caliber rifle,"Please do not purchase this for a 22 caliber rifle. The brass weight is not heavy enough to get the string started through the barrel. I saw all the other reviews and this product looked good. Not for 22 caliber and I bet the same problem with .177 caliber. I purchased the 22 caliber size. I thought it would be good for quick clean after shooting. For a 22 caliber rifle it was an exercise in frustration to get it to feed through (ever try pushing string??). My son and I both tried numerous times and got it through once. He was holding the gun and I was trying to feed it through, then I tried it alone too. We had the barrel pointed downward and tried numerous times to get it through. What a waste. Get a rod and some patches or make your own patches from cut up flannel. Sorry I wasted the money. Not worth the hassle!!!!"
1,BoreSnake not for .17 HMR,"The Hoppe's .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire (HMR) BoreSnake is too large for a .17 HMR rifle. WAY TOO THICK....Instead use a Tipton's 36"" carbon rod with patches. I previously purchased two Hoppe's BoreSnakes for my .22 Match LR and .223 bolt. These works great --- Tight enough to clean barrel while wrapping snake around hand and pulling hard. On the range a boresnake quickly return weapon to sub MOA shooting. This .17 boresnake will be used with Butch's oil and a couple .17 patches for field cleaning otherwise it is a waste of money."
1,The pull string is too fat!,"After reading all the great reviews of the Bore Snake, I was very excited about it. The problem is the pull string is way too fat to drop through the bore.I tied some fishing line to the weight and was able to pull it through. After it was through, it worked great. But that's a bigger hassle than using regular old rods and brushes.It would probably be great on a larger bore, but on my .223s, it's just not workable."
1,.22 cal boresnake a disappointment,"I have used Boresnakes for years for my handguns and rifles, of all calibers. Except, until now, .22LR.I managed to get it about 1/4 of the way into the bore, but it wouldn't budge any further. The nylon leader began to break, so I 'backed it out' and took it back to the vendor (not Amazon.com).You might have a different experience in .22LR, but this was just a tight squeeze, and I'll stick with the cleaning rod, pull through, jag and patches.In other calibers these work fine, but they should be thoroughly washed with every use, or else you're just dragging old junk through the barrel again."
1,Does not fit,I purchased the .22/.223 size and it will not fit in a .22 nor .223 barrel. Stick with a cleaning rod kit
1,too small for 7.62,I want get the easy way to clean my rifle. my it is too small for 7.62 / 303 and 308
2,JFM,"I should have bought a rod and brush. The snake cannot be used on my pump air rifle because you can not remove or insert the long weight through the breach opening. On my break barrel air rifle, it is so tight that I am afraid the string attaching the weight to the snake is going to break off. I used it (.177) on my 22 rim fire long rifle and pistol. It was snug and cleaned those well."
3,"Good Product, but Made in China.","Works well, cleans guns fast for right after shooting.Still need to clean gun with brushes and solvent, but now you can wait to do that.Made in China - They should tell you that up front."
4,life saver,"i couldn't find a .17 bore snake anywhere except amazon believe it or not, but i'm glad i got it. because it's smaller diameter, be very careful, no snap yet but i always feel like it will on first pull. not a manufacture flaw or anything just how it is. somewhat fraying, not alot, after a few uses."
2,Fine for large calibers but @#$%* for a .22,"I have one of these for my .357 magnum revolver and that's fine. It does a reasonable job and is way faster that brushes and patches.I bought another for a .22 rifle and it was a disaster. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's difficult to get the weight to pass through the barrel - it's not heavy enough and too close to the diameter of the barrel. So close, in fact, that I managed to get it lodged in the barrel - wouldn't fall through & couldn't pull it out. I called a gunsmith and he laughed. Apparently I'm not the only one to have this experience.If it happens to you, you might try the fix he suggested - put a small rubber stopper in the muzzle and fill the bore with copper solvent overnight. That softened up the brass enough that I could drive it out with a squib rod.Needless to say I would never use this again for a .22"
3,It's good but . . .,"First, let me admit that I love the ease of use and the effectiveness of the bore snake. Great for cleaning up right after firing a number of rounds. But the down side is that they don't hold up very well to regular use. After 30 times through the barrel my bore snakes are falling apart and the brush is worn out. If you want to use these have several on hand. They don't last forever."
5,awsome bore snake,"the bore snake is the easist cleaning object Ive ever used, one pull of the product and wow its clean."
5,Outstanding product,Great item for a quick bore cleaning. You run the snake through the barrel once and you're good to go. No more need to punch a rod down the barrel with a piece of cloth on the end of it.
4,Great Timesaver,"Some people prefer the old bore punch method and think these are useless, but I think these are a great time saver. I usually go through 2-3 time with a snake, and then I switch to patches. I have definitely noticed a reduction in cleaning time when using boresnakes."
4,Does its job,"I use this to clean my rifle at the range following the use of corrosive ammunition. Fits in a snack-sized ziploc for convenient, clean transport and does a good job of cleaning. In my opinion it does not replace a thorough cleaning with a rod, brush and patches but works nicely for a quick cleaning in the field."
4,Cleans Beyond Belief,"I have never used one of these until I bought this one, even though I had seen them around for years. Wow, I am astonished at how easily and how thoroughly they clean. A simple, elegant solution for a task that we all must endure. I must admit, however, that I add a little Hoppe's No. 9 because I like the smell."
5,Bore Snake,Perfect cleaning method. It is better than brushes and cloth wads. In most all material is removed with one pull-through.
3,Just wasn't what I thought it would be,"Received it with no problems, did not like the storage area for the camera, the material it was made with was hard to work with and the interior was small and did not hold as much as it was supposed to, would be fine just as a good back pack, but not for transporting the camera. I have a Nikon D300 and with the battery attached it did not work well at all only had decent room for 1 other lens and a small flash. Just didn't work for me."
1,Not compatible,"I bought these so my wife could enter/exit my Jeep more easily. I cannot comment on the quality or value as they do not fit my 1999 Jeep Wrangler SE even though the Amazon ""Find Parts That Fit Your Vehicle"" application states quite clearly that this product will fit my particular make/model. Will be returning for a refund."
5,Pretty and fun,"The earrings are pretty and fun. The silver, black, and red shine nicely from my hair. A nice weight and length."
3,Pretty but I find them top-heavy and easy to tip,I wanted something durable but nicer looking than plastic cups. These are great looking but I find the triangular base makes them somewhat top-heavy and they tip over much easier than a glass/cup with a round base.
5,Different doesnt always mean worse,"All you Arthur / Camelot followers, please watch this movie and understand, THIS is quite possibly the most realistic version you will ever see. No Merlin... No Magic No Dragons. Its a realistic view of what Camelot would of been like. NOT some fairy tale mother Goose impression. Hate to down all you people, because I really like the Legend, but a different interpretation should not be downed solely for that. Gere was OK, Julia was good, Sean was great (as usual) Ben Cross is a natural. The costumes, the scenic views were great. There was nothing wrong with this movie. Besides the fact it is a different interpretation (which is why it gets low reviews, not because of its TRUE movie worth) its a must buy."
1,''FIRST KNIGHT'' ISN'T.,"Quite overblown. Connery is ok. Ormand:a liberated 20th century Guinevere? Doesn't work. And Richard Gere: the Lancelot from Larchmont! His accent just ruins this character. And the sets: Camelot overgrown and overblown. I laughed and cried equally through this motion picture travesty. Get ""Excalibur"". It's a masterpiece."
1,Last Knight,"Typical big-budget Hollywood cookie-cutter production that appeals to the masses with big names and catchy scenes in the previews before word gets out on how appalling the film really is.Here the Arthurian genre has been reduced to an expensive but unconvincing stage backdrop for modern characters with modern values wearing tights and shiny armor. Given the disposition of the characters, one wonders why the writers even bothered to set this story in a medieval setting: it could have been 20th century New York City and it wouldn't have made any difference. Connery, Gere, and Ormond all deliver boring ""stick to the script"" performances with no emotion.This movie isn't even worth renting or having as a gift. Don't waste your time on this Hollywood fodder: it's not even worth one star."
3,Blue Cheese,"Yes, it's King Arthur color-coordinated, and it's cheesy pretty much beyond belief. Nonetheless, these cardboard characters are still fun to watch. And, from a literary perspective, it's kind of neat to see the film-makers take the trouble to include a cart a la Chretien de Troyes and the conflict between Logres (Arthur's England) and Gorre (the traditional land of the evil Meleagant -- here titled Malagant and made a former Knight of the blue formica Round Table). Yes, it's hard not to make fun of this movie -- well, maybe that's part of the pleasure. My guess: it's going to get even campier and more hilarious as time passes."
1,appalling,You might think you want to get this film but believe me; you don't! Just get Excalibur instead! Why does Hollywood insist on dumbing things down?!?!? Did they think they could better a story that has endured for over a millenium? UTTER DRIVEL. Can you imagine the outcry if another nation's folk traditions/legends etc. were treated with this kind of contempt...
4,A good movie.,I found this movie in Wal-Mart's $5.00 movie bin. I just had to buy it. I think that this is a good movie.
3,Just Campy,"I'm a sucker for sappy, but campy doesn't cut it. Now I admit back in the mid-nineties I was more taken with this movie because frankly I didn't know better. Probably still on my Pretty Woman high and thought Richard Gere was just too cute for words. Now as I watch this, I'm struck by how lazy Gere's performance truely is. While Connery and Osmond performances seem effortless, Richard just phone this performance in. I'm more annoyed of how instant this deep abiding love Lancelot has for Geneieve-to the point it's an insult to anyone's intelligence. I love Connery, but seeing him always paired with women old enough to be his granddaughter is tiresome. Overall, the production looks cheap and most likely majority of the budget went to actor's salaries. Overall, this romantic romp will do in a pinch."
5,simply the best,"come on you guys who cares about changes in the story line the sole purpose of such movies is to provide entertainment which this movie effectly does. this movie is for those who look for perfection in acting,story,direction and not for those who judge everything by facts"
3,"Good over all, but too much exageration...","if i could have rated this movie 2.5 i would have... i would say that over all, it's was a decent movie, but there's too much exageration (ie: when they jump down the water fall) and what happens is not realy realisting and not serious... i would say it's a light movie. it's like they wanted to make the bad guy, look realy bad, but it doesn't work. But, i must admit that the end is GREAT. Beside that, i wouldn't recommand that movie, if you're looking for a more realistic medieval movie, try BraveHearth. Maybe this one is too much about romance."
2,Not the best Arthurian movie,"This is a good,not great, movie. Its nice to look at more than anything else, with handsome actors and decent performances. For anyone who knows about the Arthurian Legend, the movie 'Excalibur' is far and away the best, even though it has its' own flaws. Still, it has many wondrous moments that 'First Knight' lacks. Lancelot in Excalibur is much better than Gere. First Knight seems to almost wholly disregard the legend of the Grail, Lady of the Lake and anything else that makes this legend so special. First Knight is a nice movie to rent, but Excalibur is a movie you should OWN."
4,Fun look at the Arthurian legend,"Those well-versed with Arthurian legend know of Lancelot, and he is one of the primary characters in this film. it is a unique look at the legends of Camelot and the dynamics between Arthur, Lancelot, and the beautiful Guinevere. Sean Connery makes a great Arthur, and this is a good movie, though it may be a bit slow-paced at times."
5,Beautiful Love Story,"I loved the performances in this lovely movie, as there was intense chemistry between all three of the main characters. There was also a lot of action and daring scenes, especially for Richard Gere, as Lancelot. A perfect cast made this one a favorite of mine."
3,King Arthur Legend,"This is a decent retelling of the King Arthur legend with Sean Connory as Arthur and Richard Gere as Lancelot. Though I prefer Excalibur in the King Arthut mythos, which is the greatest knights in armor film ever made."
5,A superb Story and Cast,"DVD The First Knight with Richard GereAn exceptional film. It shows action without the usual filthy words that are in so many current American movies with action, so wonderful. The villain is intelligent, provides clever action. Pagentry is spectacular. Hero carries himself well into conflict. Boy meets girl in an interesting way.Purched this DVD at Amazon.com."
3,Richard Gere reprises his role in Breathless but in costume...,"still with the American accent! The bad guys, especially in the ""black castle"" rescue scenes, make one think of a sci-fi/ darthvader rehash. Too bad, because Sean Connery and Julia Ormond have a believable chemistry and they keep soldiering on,in spite of the script. They almost pull the film off.In the end, the movie is so uneven that all the references to Camelot, Roundtable and Excaliber just made me think of other, better films on the subject. I suggest The Mists of Avalon, or Excaliber (with a young Helen Miren doing quite unlikely stuff, beautifully!) Both movies are more respectful of your imagination and intelligence than is First Knight."
4,It's no Excalibur but still a good film.,First Knight is a interesting retelling of the classic Aurthorian legends without any magic. Almost all the actors especially Connery do excellent jobs in their roles and the films high production values help bring Camelot alive. Richard Gear is bad choice for Lancelot but doesn't detract from the films overall presentation. The only downside to the film is the corny love story between Lancelot and Guinivere.
5,This is a wonderful version of the story of Lancelot.,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. It has something for both men and women. For men it has adventure and sword fighting, for women of course it has romance. It is funny and extremely entertaining."
1,PATRIOTIC AND HEROIC MISSION,"By writing this review, I must say I'm doing it with the noblest of purposes: to warn you all tho keep well away from this farce, the complete destruction of Arthurian legend in one of the most commercial filsm ever produced by Hollywwod. After saying that, I consider my mission completed."
4,Sean Connery's Knight,"""First Knight"" takes concepts from King Arthur mythology to tell a story around some costumes and beautiful scenery. More about scenery and script than anything else. It's stripped down in terms of fantasy, but I liked it. Sean Connery's King Arthur is warmly done, and Richard Gere's Lancelot is pretty likeable. Queen Guinevere, though, I find a bit hard to understand. She's in a fair bit of denial through the film."
4,Not Much For the Arthurian Legend,"This movie was definately entertaining. The story does move too far from the tradition of King Arthur for my taste, and yet the question remains whether it could be done with out the Athurian Legend. The movie is well rounded and entertaining. Gere does not do justice to the characte of Lancelot, but it was not just his acting. Lancelot is protrayed as just an ordinary rogue who happens to become a knight of the round table by accident, and not chivalry. If you can get passed this, then the movie has good action scenes and is definately worth watching."
4,noble beginnings,"great, wholesome story. Right for the entire family. This is a must have in the DVD library!"
2,Torn,"This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story. But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie. Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie.... Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend... much like the more recent movie about King Arthur. Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers...... So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating...."
2,"dry, slow and not much fun","this one follows into the love triangle of King Arthur, Lancelot and Lady Guinevere....not much exciting really..although there are some good moments and the passion can be put off to the side as dry and not great also..Gere, Connery and Ormond have their moments but the story itself from Willaim Nicholson is silly, but Camelot is beautiful...dry, I say..NOTE: look closely at the part where Gere is being knighted as one of them...you'll see a familiar face if your a Buffy or Angel fan, Alexis Denisof is one of the knights of the round table..dont miss it"
2,Hollywood disease,"Who should she choose?The guy old enough to be her father, or the guy old enough to be her Grandfather?"
1,Useless and redundant,"Gere is just putrid as Lancelot, Ormond a bit squirrelish, and Connery's fine effort wasted. Boorman's ""Excalibur"" is far and away the superior Arthurian legend movie."
1,criminal,"This film is an insult to the viewers intelligence and the Arthurian tradtion. I can not believe how awful this film is. Wooden acting, contempt for the source material, some of the worst period costumes and armour ever seen in a film and a scrip to bad they could use it for torture sessions..."
4,A GREAT SPIN ON THE LEGEND!,"""First Knight"" may never reach the heights of acclaim like ""Excalibur,"" but this re-telling of the legend of King Arthur is, in my opinion, just as good as ""Excalibur"" if not better. Sean Connery IS the fabled king of Camelot, and Julia Ormond is vibrant and beautiful as Guinevere. Richard Gere as Launcelot is the only part of this film that keeps it from getting five stars. The rest of the film, however, is great. Add it to your collection today! Grade: A-"
3,Good if you want a love story...,"but not so good as Arthurian legend. The story is simply changed too much. Although Connery, Gere, and Ormond are excellent choices to play Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere respectively, I just couldn't get into it. The love story between Lance and Gwen isn't even the same as in the traditional legend. But, as I said, if you don't care if it strays from tradition and you are looking for a good love story, this film is a good bet."
3,Great updated swashbuckling from Gere,"Let's be honest--this is not the Arthurian legend; it's Hollywood Mass Market. You can't put it in the same league as ""Excalibur."" There is no such character as ""Malagant."" The main reason to see this film is for Richard Gere's athletic sword fighting technique, which combines baseball, kendo and several other Asian techniques. Jerry Zucker must have sat down and said, ""I don't want the standard sword fighting scenes that we've seen a hundred times before. Let's show the audience something new."" And Gere with his natural athletic ability delivers. The anachronist elements are intentional, people. That's what's fun about this popcorn flick."
2,One of the worst movies ever,"I really wanted my money back after watching this, but what I wanted more was the 90 minutes of my life that I wasted.Not much good about this movie at all: horrible script, terrible acting (even by Sean), the set was okay. And to it's credit, it was better than Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.Watch at your own risk."
1,utter contempt for source material...,"This film is an insult to the viewers intelligence and the Arthurian tradtion. I can not believe how awful this film is. Wooden acting, contempt for the source material, some of the worst period costumes and armour ever seen in a film and a scrip to bad they could use it for torture sessions..."
2,What has Hollywood done?,"I usually enjoy the talents of Sean Connery and Richard Gere very much, but this movie needs more than their names on the marquee to make it good. I know there are different versions of Arthurian Legend, but this story doesn't come close to telling the Arthur story. Other than naming characters Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie bears very little resemblance to the known stories of King Arthur. While I know screenwriters are allowed to be creative with their ideas, why name the characters Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere if they are going to completely change the story? This movie is all right if you are in the mood to watch a romance set in medieval times (or if you are a HUGE fan of Sean Connery or Richard Gere). But if you are wanting the story of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie is absurd and not worth watching."
3,Nicely remastered,"Pic quality is good, especially the close up shots. Julia Ormond and Richard Geer look splendidly sharp, the night battle scenes crisp.Storyline, watching it many years down the road, seem somewhat corny now. And fight choreography is not like what we get in movies today. The background castle scenery also looks noticeably fake under this sharper picture. But nevertheless enjoyable, rekindles old memories."
2,"Connery is great, Ormond is beautiful, the film is bad","This is such a poor representation of the myth of Camelot that its hard to believe that the same man responsible for Forrest Gump did this. Richard Gere is much like Kevin Costner, in that he has to employ a very poor English accent for his part. I could care less. Neither actor pulled that off, but I never felt that was important to the films. Costner's Robin Hood is a good escapist, fun film, whereas First Knight is boring, tedious and uninspired. If a viewer wants to enjoy a truly great film on Camelot, he/she should watch Excalibur. It is far better in every way, except one. Connery is a great King Arthur. Its too bad he couldnt have had the inspired talent surrounding him necessary to make such a great tale into a likewise great movie."
1,This production is inexcusably poor on many levels.,"Considering the incredible talent and financial resources that went into the production of this film, it is astonishingly atrocious. The usually wonderful Sean Connery does King Arthur as a wimp, while Richard Gere is totally miscast as a 90's hero in the Middle Ages. With all the research available in Medieval Clothing, the costumes are more appropriate for Star Trek. The Production design is equally anachronistic. Ben Cross's band of evil doers handle their pistol crossbows (non-existent in the period) as if they were semi-automatic pistols. Merlin is nowhere to be found. Even Bing Crosby's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" seems more historically accurate, and in touch with human truths."
4,Good as a leave-in conditioner rather than styling product.,"Brylcreem is one if several dozen old-timely products that are the rage this year 2012/13. This product smells great, like fresh talc and linen. It provides extremely mild hold that is not wind or water resistant. It works great as a hair softener or conditioner especially in combination with a mask or cap over damp hair. I like it for for very subtle grooming and styling without tremendous shine or an overly manicured look. I have course straight Asian black hair with approx. 3"" length on top to part and comb. Brylcreem is good for grooming stray hairs together but not necessarily to hold them in place all day or in adverse conditions. The product does not leave any oily resideue or induce skin breakouts in 3 month experience. Would recommend this for finer, thinning, or lighter weight hair typesfor best styling and hold results."
5,surprising,"I was shocked and saddened by the straight forward detail of the subject and yet found it to be well presented. Certainly a book I would highly recommend to anyone in the juvenile ""helpling profession,"" Lawyers, Counselors, Social Workers and etc.."
3,It didn't satiated my hunger...,"The beginning was a bit weak if a bit confusing with the author throwing in too many characters and plots. Morgan's obsessive and compulsive behavior was a bit hard to swallow at times. Dante's character was okay, but I didn't find him compelling. The whole twin-separate-at-birth and suddenly-found-mother looked kind of forced, as if the author didn't know what else to put in order to ""thicken"" the plot. I found the subplot with Maxine (Morgan's twin sister) and Lou much more interesting!"
3,It was not what i thought it would be.,I really like maggie shayne's writing but this time.I just couldn't get into twilght hunger.They had to many stories going at once.It was hard to keep up.I hope her next one is better.
2,A Disappointment,"While the latest from Maggie Shayne is certainly original, it lacks the passion that her earlier novels have. As someone mentioned earlier, this is less a romance than a fiction novel, and perhaps that's why I was so disappointed. The secondary characters have nearly as much ""page time"" as the main characters, and the result is a basic lack of development. I just couldn't bring myself to care about Dante and Morgan- partially because the novel didn't facilitate it, and partially because the characters just aren't very sympathetic. The hero is, frankly, far too brutal, and the heroine is too self-absorbed, unethical, and just plain pathetic. It seems to me that Ms. Shayne is trying to edge her way into straight fiction with ""Twilight Hunger""(and her recent ""The Gingerbread Man""), but it's just not what she does best."
2,Just OK,"I started this series in the middle, my first book was Dracula and Stormy. I liked the series a lot and read all the books from that point on to the most current ""Lover's Bite"". I liked them all. I went back to read ""the "" beginning of the story and just could not get into the first couple of books, it would have discouraged me at the start so I am glad I started in the middle. If you are a fan of the series, it give good backstory on the characters. But the later books starting at #10 Edge of Twilight (totally ***** 5 full stars on Edge) and the rest after 10 and up are all 4 or 5 *'s for me."
4,Good Story,"I enjoyed this contemporary vampire romance. I thought the characters worked well together and I would recommend this novel. Morgan DeSilva is a struggling screenwriter, who cannot seem to get any of her work off the ground. Her family used to be very wealthy but with her parents' death she found out that she no longer has any money. She must learn to support herself. Morgan moves into an old house in Maine owned by a friend, and is trying to write, but is running into a brick wall. Then she discovers a manuscript that she just falls in love with. It is a story about a vampire. Morgan decides to use this work. Dante is a vampire on the run. He is being hunted, and while running ends up at one of his hideaways which is beneath the house he used to own. He discovers Morgan, and is oddly attracted to her, but at the same time furious because she is publishing his private diaries. I enjoyed this novel and would recommend."
2,Not the best.,"I was really looking forward to reading this novel, as I have read all of Maggie Shayne's books up to date, but I was really disappointed. Too little time is spent on the developement and story of the main characters, while too much of the story is focused on supporting characters.The storyline involving the main characters is weak and boring, I found myself wishing that the story had been about the supporting characters.This is the only book of Maggie Shayne's that I haven't liked. Maybe the next one will be better..."
5,How Did I Miss It??,"I can't believe I never caught this movie the first time around. I went to see the sequel and immediately decided I needed to catch up. I barely found a copy at my local Blockbuster (one of those ""Oh it just came in"" moments) and watched it twice. I'm here writing a review because I just finished buying it. There is an extremely erudite review already posted here, so I won't belabor the point. It's just this...if you liked Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, Once Upon A Time in Mexico, or Good Fellas, you will love this flick and probably, like me, want to have it in your library. It's one of those movies you can watch again and again...dare I say it? A cult classic, for sure, but only for those that get the joke. When Saints II becomes available, I'm getting that one too."
5,BoonDock Saints - Awesome Movie,I thought it was an especially good movie. The characters rooted out evil by the very means the evil used to exist and progress. I have no idea why this film was banned in the states.
1,Theocratic drivel,"Is this movie suppose to be cool because it is about Irish Americans from Boston who follow the law according to the majority religion of there community? Change the cultural and religious background and you have a documentary on the mentality of self riotous religious memeoids; i.e. terrorists such as in the 9-11 attacks which hold one idea above all else, including ones own life. Well my god says the screenwriter is a tool and should be shot, unfortunately I'm not as brainwashed as the fools in this movie and I don't feel a need to take a gun to someones head. Although while watching this movie my trigger finger certainly felt the urge to put this to an early end by whatever means possible; gun, remote, blunt object thru the screen.The popularity of this film goes to show how so many Americans are just as out of touch with an objective reality as those (terrorits etc) which they hate most and thereby really are none the better."
1,over kill this movie please,"Typical, 'in the name of God', killing spree. Embraced by the public for ridding society of trash. overly simplistic with absolutely no artistic view. Sums itself up when willem, in a also typical nonenthusiastic monotone role, states that what the saints did was 'like in the movies'. seems as though the movie tried to employ ALL aspects of pop high volume films yet fails miserably. I would not even suggest wasting four dollars to rent it.I disliked the movie so much that I gave my copy away. Should have never purchased it in the first place. True fans of Tarantino and Ritchie will undoubtedly be equally disappointed.Would have taken stars away if possible."
1,The Worst Ever!,I am usually not offended by most R rated movies with the violence or language but this one goes WAY beyond most..... 5 x more F words than most language filled R rated movies...I couldn't believe it..Way too violent too...But not only that there was no plot. And the FBI guy was gay.Even if you like the language/ vilence. This movie is boring and stupid and has no plot.Don't waste your money. I watch a lot of movies and there is only a few that a really really dislike..
1,Painful to watch,"The fact that this movie compares itself (on the back cover) to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is an outrage. This is the type of movie that tries hard to be intelligent and controversial and fails miserably on all fronts. The plot is ludicrous, the character motivations are very poorly formed, the flow is sporadic, and it has made me lose all respect for Defoe as an actor - truly painful to watch."
1,Quite boring,"This movie has poor writing. This movie has poor acting, except for Dafoe. My old roomate reccomended this movie. I almost turned it off halfway through because I was bored of it. There are movies much more entertaining than this one."
1,There's a reason it's only [$$]...,"This is the worst movie I have ever purchased. I bought it on the false advice of a friend against whom I have subsequently started a retaliatory smear campaign. Do NOT buy this movie, it has already ruined one life. It is worse than cancer."
4,Why do critics hate it? It's a good flick,"It ain't Citizen Kane, but Rotten Tomatotes gave it a much undeserved 8% rating (that's awful, for those who don't know). My wife and I both really enjoyed it. Alternately funny, violent, thrilling. Willem Dafoe was excellent. I really respect him for taking on such an odd role. His performance alone is worth the cost of a rental.Anyway, don't believe the haters. It's a good one."
2,Like a Tarrantino film except even worse if thats possible,"Mildly interesting for about 15 minutes because I wanted to see where they were going with it and totally unwatchable after that. Imagine a Quentin Tarrantino film, except even worse, which is saying a lot because Tarrantino makes horrible movies."
1,one of the worst movies i ever saw,"had heard about this movie,my teenage sons love it.i'm irish,i guess i'm supposed to like it.but to be honest,its one of the stupidest movies i ever saw.i love willem dafoe,but he deserves the ham actors award for this one.i love ""the departed"" and ""the town""movies with somewhat similiar themes,but this one gets a bronx cheer"
1,Awful,"This movie is NOTHING like Pulp Fiction(or any other Tarantino film it invariably gets compared to). Violence is not a reason to draw an instant comparison to Quentin Tarantino's work, this movie lacks any of the style or adept writing of ANYTHING Tarantino has done. Boondock Saints comes off as cheesy, melodramatic, and just plain stupid in numerous parts. The acting is horrible(especially by Rocco), and the smarmy message of ""is vigilatism wrong"" comes off as fake and flacid. If you're looking for a movie similar in style to Pulp Fiction this is NOT it."
5,BUY THIS MOVIE!!!,"There is nothing I can say that will do this movie justice. It is truly a brilliant film that ANYONE will enjoy. If you like superior directing, flawless acting, an enlightening storyline, and intelligent dialogue loaded with dry humor, this movie is a must see."
4,GET THE MOVIE,"I love Irish people and I love crime sotories.You might back away now, thinking this is sime kinf of a mafia movie but its not.The movie is about two irish brothers who think they have amission from GOD to ckean the city from all evil.Armed with this fait and awonderfull sense of humor this guys do the unthinkable.william defu is the ditective that trails them defu gives a powerfull preformance of this really strange and smart agent.As he close down on the two he starts to believe that the two have somthing in what they say and starts to doubt his own part in the big game.The acting is briliant, The text is amazingly good and the story is funny, smart and somtimes breathtaking in its depth.Its amust"
4,Exceptional Film...,"This is an spectacular film with a great plot! The film contains enough action and suspense to enterain and the comic relief to keep you laughing...Two brothers, both religious-fanatics, deem it nesseccary to kill ""sinners"" (criminals) in their local area in order to help citizens realize that sins do NOT go unpunished!William Defoe plays an FBI agent who tracks these men and tries to solve the multiple murders that are committed by these ""holy men."" His portrayal of this character is one of his best roles ever...and the conclusion is so unexpected it will blow your mind."
4,Good movie.,"Item shipped fast & was received as described. Smooth transaction, would buy from you again.Brian"
5,oh yes tis a great movie,"I love the scene we he is tied to the toilet. Yes there is alot of shooting, but this is done well. William Dafoe does a good job as the detective assigned to get the two brothers."
4,"Awesome movie, OK dvd","This movie is indeed awesome, but the only problem I have with the DVD is that they didn't make it anamorphic! doh! That means if you have a widescreen TV it will still be 'stretched' with the FULL black bars on the top and bottom... annoying to say the least. Hopefully they'll make a 'special edition' or something eventually."
3,"Boondock Saints is good, but a masterpiece? Hmmmmm.","I am in the camp that finds a lot to like about ""Saints"", but there are several parts in the movie that just drag along with no end in sight. Also, the CONSTANT flashbacks are annoying at times. What I do like are the 2 lead characters sent on a ""mission from God"" to kill. The dialogue is also entertaining even if writer/director Troy Duffy jumped on the Pulp Fiction (aka anything goes) bandwagon at the time. Willem Dafoe is a riot as a gay FBI agent and Billy C is great as a crazy hit man. The movie has developed quit a cult status and I say good for Boondock Saints. It's far from perfect, but is worth a look. Also worth a look is the documentary called Overnight, which shows how loudmouth director Troy Duffy got himself blacklisted from Hollywood after Saints wrapped production. I don't think Harvey Weinstein has Duffy's phone number on speed dial anymore...."
3,Average...,"It's a decent flick, nothing amazing. I don't see the big obsession, especially in recent years, this movie came out in 1999, saw it then, thought it was ok. But, why is it in 2005 it became a huge hit with teenagers, I guess when it first came out, they were too young, and there parents wouldn't let them see it. Rent before you buy. It may just not be your cup of tea."
4,"Originality Elsewhere, Excellence Right Here","It was inevitable, I suppose, after the success of 'Resevoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', and the increasing cult-status popularity of Guy Ritchie's two entries in the genre, that other films would go the quirky route and try their hand at the same style of comedy/drama/HK cinema. This is Mike Duffy's first and ONLY film on the market, and if he never makes another one, it won't matter, because he hit a home run on the first swing.It's quite simplistic in plot when compared to 'Lock, Stock...' or even 'Pulp', but that isn't a bad thing. It has the frenetic pace of those movies, and a similarly comedic take on their various characters; not to mention the non-linear storytelling those films are now quite famous for.But the casting is brilliant; and Willem Dafoe puts in a great (and sometimes scary) performance as the know-it-all FBI agent with a change of heart. The whole film's endlessly quotable."
4,"Great Movie, OK DVD","This is a great movie that never got the attention it deserved because of the Columbine tragedy. The plot has already been discussed quite a bit so I won't get into that. This DVD is decent quality but doesn't have any special extras. It is the movie only. If you have the opportunity, pick up the Japanese import version of this DVD. The Japanese version contains the Director's uncut version of the film (a lot of violence was cut from the DVD sold here on Amazon). It also contains a director's audio commentary track that is very insightful, along with 3 trailers and some other bonus material that you don't get on the North American release."
2,Saints?,"Bought this movie for my daughter. She loves the two hunks who star as ""saints"" who murder all the criminals. Too much blood and violence for mom."
3,"good condition, slow shipping",package was in perfect condition. unfortunately it didn't arrive on time and took much longer than claimed.
4,Stylish to no end and completely under the radar,"It's great to see a movie like this. For those of us who constantly wade through so many Indie movies to find those films that just really take hold of you and make the wait seem well worth it. After a long run of watching some really dry movies, I came across this one in a video store. It looked interesting enough to be in the theatres and I wondered why I hadn't seen it before. 'My wife and I took it home and watched it....then we watched it again. After we woke up the next morning, we watched it one more time. Once I parted ways with this enormously entertaining flick, I purchased it as soon as I could. I think the fact that my wife loved it speaks volumes about the movie. I show it to everybody that I come across, and it has since found it's way into every one of my friend's video libraries. The best thing about this movie is the fact that nobody knows about it. People are finding out though......don't miss this one."
5,Boondock Saints,"I happened to rent this movie at blockbuster, only because i had seen all of the good movie that was out at the time, and because it had the catchy box cover. I didn't have very high hopes for it, i was only looking for something to pass the time. It totaly blew away any expectations i had for the movie. I looked every where on the net and couldn't find it, but was able to buy a used copy from blockbuster. I have showed this movie to about a dozen people now, and all of them have absolutly loved it, and now own there own copy. In short, this is the best movie i have seen in years. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Who was the target audience for this movie?,"Farfetched. The characters are farfetched, the situations the characters get into are farfetched, and the dialogue is farfetched. ""The Boondock Saints"" is a vigilante-type movie about Boston that takes place in Southie, and unless you are part of the targeted demographic, you won't find this film to be very interesting.Willem DaFoe portrays a Godlike bitch who knows everything and drives everyone around him in the Boston Police Department nuts. I guess that's supposed to be funny. The two Irish kids who decide to take on organized crime in Boston are so seemingly invulnerable, they may as well have superhuman powers. I guess they were supposed to be dudes who were not to be screwed with, but they came across as just plain weird.The only reason I didn't give this film one star is that ""The Boondock Saints"" isn't offensive; It's just forgettable."
4,It was pretty good,"Nothing better than a gangster movie with a plot, It was a good flick....Worth the money if you buy a used one"
5,Awesome.,"I remember watching this when I was younger and thought it was awesome. All these years later, I still think this movie is worth every penny and more."
1,Yuck,"got the dvd, it didnt work. case was in great condition, but the movie didnt play at all. not returning it because my boyfriend wants the aluminum case."
5,What a Movie,"This film, a newly acquired DVD of mine, is amazing. The cinematography of the movie is beautiful and on par with many Quentin Tarantino masterpieces. The movie is a strong reminder that society's justice system can only reach so far. A haunted FBI agent (played wonderfully by William Dafoe) sees the deeds of two mysterious Irish brothers (Flanery and Reedus)as they go about trying to make Boston a better place with their bumbling ex-Mafia Friend (Rocco).While the film does have a bit of gratuitous violence from time to time, it has a good message: any person can change the world (For good or bad albeit) The credits at the end of the movie are an accurate representation of how this movie may be recieved. Some (myself included) will love this movie, while others will not enjoy it as much."
3,Willem Dafoe in an over the top performance,Based on the wide disparity of the other ratings here at Amazon Boondock Saints appears to be a love it or hate it type of film. In my case I neither loved it nor hated it. I found the story of two Irish brothers performing incredibly violent and at times implausible acts of vigilantism entertaining enough. At times the plot seemed a bit disjointed and jumpy. However Willem Dafoe's performance as a federal agent on their trail is so over the top and campy that I think he stole the movie. His banter with the hard-nose Boston cops is hysterically funny at times and makes the movie worth watching.
3,Good B Movie,"I bought this movie because one of the actors was: Sean Patrick Flanery and I really liked him in Young Indiana Jones. This was a good ""B"" movie that I put in my trading stack vice my keeper stack. The plot was rather hard to keep straight and/or follow."
5,awsome,This movie has got to be the most underrated movie of all time. I'd never heard of it 'till last year my friend made me watch it. I bought it a few months later when I came across it in a store and have watched it atleast twenty times and it's still really good. You should buy this movie.
2,i dont hate to tell the truth,"this movie is not that good. here is the problem: imitation. everything in this movie has been done as well or better in some other movie. the dialogue is cheesy, the acting is horrible, other than defoe, and the whole movie is bits and pieces of what the director has seen in past movies. most likely tarentino films, which other than dusk til dawn, cant be touched by anyone. as for the violence, we have seen that as well. make it more over the top, you can never have to much insane violence in a movie. the directing was done well, but it was all deja vu. nothing that interested me, when the cat was on the table i thought to myself, they are going to kill the cat, oh and look what happened. totally predictable, totally stupid."
1,An Awful Movie,"The Boondock Saints is an awful movie. The script does not hold together and saying that the plot is weak is putting it mildly. The acting is 3rd rate at best as is both the direction and the special effects. Too much of the movie is clearly done for shock value alone and there is little internal consistency. There is little common sense to anything that happens in this movie. Ultimately, the suspension of disbelief is violated due to the film's manifest shortcomings.I rate The Boondock Saints at 1 out of 5 maximum stars only because there is no option to rate it at zero stars."
1,Soooooooo bad,All the people I know who rave about this are complete and total idiots. What a laughable attempt at a Tarantino knock off.
2,Violence!,"""Violence"" is all I can say about this movie. Certainly not my cup of tea, but the men in my life love it. It reminded me a bit of Pulp Fiction...not sure why, but it did. It was strangely engrossing, but I was also disturbed by the amount of violence throughout the film."
5,"I normally don't say this, but FOLLOW THE CROWD","Boondock Saints is one of the most important independent films to grace our time. It broaches the social idea of taking matters into your own hands, forgetting the system and doing what is right. It is eccentric BECAUSE THEY ARE IRISH, the fight scenes are necessarily exaggerated due to the heavily religious overtones associated with them as being chosen to carry out Heaven's will, but even the characters acknowledge the strange luck that seems to never leave their side and the arsenal of talent (and, yes, the one with guns too) that they had unconsciously mastered as being pretty incredible. I thought it truly innovative and were I someone important this might mean something. Anyway, I recommend it. Godspeed."
2,What is this film about?,"I admit I probably had unreasonably high expectations based on reviews here. What a dissapointment! I agree 100% with a reviewer who said it was more style than substance. Stylish? Yes, but incredibly shallow. I gotta say, though, that the music score is excellent, photography is very good, and actors indeed do their best, but their best is not good enough to save this movie. Don't even start comparing it to Lock, Stock... or Snatch, or Leon, or Desperado even. Or, for that matter, to any other film that has plot, characters, and working script. Do yourself a favor and rent it if you must. Do not buy."
2,Its okay .,"This Movie was okay. I don't know why anybody would compare this to Pulp Fiction or Snatch. I would not buy this movie, its okay to rent one day when your bored its somewhat entertaining. But overall this flick sucks the main characters are corny and the hole plot of the move."
2,Makes the mafia look bad...,"First of all I can't believe how easy it is to kill mob bosses these days. Two wimpy looking boys with no training managed to kill a good amount of trained killers. Speaking of making no sense, the two main characters seem to stumble into killing bad guys (or those they chose to be bad) without any real motivation, ""Hey these guys are bad... let's kill them."" ""Ummm, okay.."" says the other saint. We're just supposed to sit here and accept this pile of nonsense with sprinkles of bad acting. Yeah, some of the scenes are entertaining and the cinematography was top notch but without a foundation of decent acting and a solid plot the movie trips and stumbles under its own weight. Don't waste your time like I did watching this movie."
2,More style than substance,"I expected more given all the reviews on amazon.com. However what I saw was a movie that was trying to be about something deep and spiritual but failing because the director was more obsessed with style (how) rather than the substance (what).The acting is quite good. But the scenarios are so implausible, and the director is trying oh so hard to make another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that it became very hard to watch this film.My recommendation: see a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino film (again). And if you must see this film, rent it. So that you can be rid of it in 5 days."
1,Was Defoe that desperate?,"This movie fails in every aspect. I don't know who it might appeal to? Perhaps it's the Irish Catholic principle thing? That sounds pathetic, but it's all I can come up other than some idiot frat guy who just loves the gore? It's a dumbed down, half witted, Tarantino film written by an egomaniac who doesn't realize that fact."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,"I saw this movie based on the recommendation of a friend, but was sorely disappointed. The only strength of this film is the outstanding performance of the always-great Willem Dafoe. Still, his part, along with all the other characters, is poorly-written and underdeveloped. Hardly any background info is given. The premise of the story is weak and the movie contains many inconsistancies which are never explained. Why this film became a cult classic escapes me, but it can probably be traced to the excessive violence and low budget that led to comparisons with Reservoir Dogs. The major difference is that Reservoir Dogs had a smart script and an interesting,engaging plot that went somewhere. Boondock Saints starts off in the same place it ends up : nowhere."
4,"Disturbing, but compelling","My daughter brought a borrowed copy of this movie home from college for the weekend. I thought Willem Dafoe was over-the-top, and the film was way too violent. But I have to admit that I can't stop thinking about thinking about the film, and the moral issues involved. My daughter says it's the best movie ever."
5,Vigilante Saints,"Vigilante killers sweep the dregs of Boston, targetting all manner of bad guys: mobsters, killers, and drug dealers alike. Taking the proverb, ""An eye for an eye,"" to the extreme end, this film raises question to one's belief system through controversial situations it presents. ""The Boondock Saints"" is a must-see film."
5,"""Thy Kingdom Come Thy Will Be Done""","This movie was somewhat similar to Pulp fiction and Reservoir dogsafter every scene that the police show up to the head officer explains what he though happenedand they do a flash back the what happened that is the contrasting styles to pulp fiction and reservoir dogsThe movie itself was about Irish freedom fighters on a mission by god to eliminate the bad people in the community (The Mob,Pimps,etc.) along the way they are joined by a Italian guy together they continue killing those who do bad in the community this movie also mixes in some comedy there are a couple funny scenes in thisSo these guys are killing all the bad guys so they are called saintsI would recomend this movie"
4,Stellar performances for so many...,"I have always been a fan of Dafoe and he doesn't disappoint in this film either. The language is ""true to life"" but horrible nonetheless. The action scenes and direction reflect the true talent of the actors and the directorial/editorial staff regardless of the budget for the film. Solid storyline with plenty of ethical and moral questions left to be answered, make this a ""must see"" movie."
4,"Great Cast, Great Film. . .","In the same vein as, and in the grand tradition of Pulp Fiction, Resivior Dogs, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, this movie is as violent as it is fun. The two lead characters (Readus, and Flannery), are out to rid their nieghborhood of bad men, namely the Russian Mofia. The William Defoe character is classic. . . The tough, gay man. Absolutly classic. Well worth the normal price of a DVD, a steal at the under 15 dollar price tag. . ."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever!!!,"Okay, when I first heard of this movie, I didn't think much of it cause it was about the whole ""God gave me the right to kill all the evil men, bla bla, bla"" So I only watched it because my friend made me. But it turned out to be one of the funniest movies ever!! I admit, there's not that much plot to it, but the comedy and the way the story is written makes up for it. The McManus twins have never killed before, so the first time that they set out to kill people, they do it just like the movies, and it's really funny. Willem Dafoe is also great in the movie, after seeing him in it, my opinion of him went up. Overall its a great movie, it has like one of the best scripts ever. I think that if you like comedies, then you should really like this movie. It does have some sad moments in it to, but its still good."
2,Belongs Under Comedy/Fantasy not Action/Drama,"This self-indulgent caricature of a movie was just plain awful. I admit, the story intrigued me; two shanty Irish vigilantes from Southie killing bad guys in the name of God? OK, I'll give it a shot, plus I heard all these rave reviews about it. Boy was I in for an unpleasant surprise. The acting was horrible and most of the characters were so ridiculous that I couldn't even take them seriously. This is one of those films that is unintentionally funny. All kidding aside, this is literally how I think a 13 year old would visualize a good action/drama film. So unless you have the mentality of a pre-teen or can enjoy this movie for what it is, a comedy/fantasy, I would suggest you don't waste your time. For a decent movie about South Boston, go watchThe Departedor evenSouthieinstead."
5,Boondock Saints.,My friend told me about this movie and she brought over the dvd so I could watch it. I loved it so much I bought it for my husband for Christmas. It is about two brothers that take the law into their own hands. I love this movie. The men love it too! Buy it you will not regret it if you like action/adventure movies. The dvd was in excellent shape and it was shipped promptly and I have no complaints. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Terrific! Full 108 min,"This is a fabulously outlandish movie, thouroghly entertaining and terrific setup scenes that just make you laugh. One of those you watch over and over. ***note: The info notes that this is the rated version but I see the run time is the full 108 minutes as was the unrated anniversary version released last year. I have not seen this version yet but I am glad the added footage seems to be there. A definite purchase for me."
5,Best Movie I Have Seen To Date,"This movie is just incredible. I notice more and more everytime I watch it. I have seen it about 15 times and it has not gotten old at all, that is when you know you have a good movie on your hands. The action is amazing. The background music is awesome. Such a good film that you can just watch over and over. This picture has some good humor mixed in with all the action and what not. Two brothers Conner and Murphy MacManus whom are played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, start to take matters into their own hands by knocking off the majority of Bostons criminals. They believe that they have been sent by God to rid the world of its evil men. I would easily reccomend this movie to anyone who is anyone that likes movies. Heh. It is a shame this movie didnt get the publicity to make it a big it, because it is definatley worth of that recognition."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I recently caught this movie late at night on basic cable. Now I can't stand cable because of the censorship, which absolutely RUINS any movie EVER aired.This one was the exception. This movie is one of the coolest, smartest, and intelligent flicks I've seen, this side of a De Niro. Not even the absurd, mandatory, babysitting-of-all-who-watch censorship could ruin this movie.I'm making a point to bring up The Boondock Saints to every friend I run in to, so they don't miss it."
5,AWESOME ACTION SCENES! BUY IT....NOW!!,"Norman Reedus (Yum) and Sean Patrick Flanery do an incredible job bringing these characters to you. Willem Dafoe is superb, love him! All the supporting actors are great to watch as well. Highly recommend this to EVERYONE!! They are currently filming the second movie, 9 years later. Great comedy, action, and very talented people. Love the deleted scene when their Ma calls! Gotta love the Irish! Nice bum!"
5,BOOHYA,I have loved this movie forever. I had been trying to get my boyfriend to watch it but he never did. I finally bought him his own copy and he loved it!
2,Poor quality,"I just purchased this movie, which is one of my favorites. The video quality is pretty low for a DVD. The menus are jumpy. I got the regular edition soon after the movie came out and that DVD has much better video. I'm not sure what the deal is with this one. Also, the extras DVD will not display the video on my computer unless played with VLC, which is again, very jumpy. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Perfectly Acceptable,"The movie came in quickly and was packaged very well. The case had a tiny crack in the spine, but I'll take that for the price any day."
5,Most underated movie of all time.,"I loved this movie, true I will give most movies the time of day but I rarley will say I have to own this. There is two scenes that I put on when having people over at the house playing pool and drinking some cold ones and I get the same affect everytime. Sure there may not be a Tom Cruise or a Mel Gibson in this movie but that only makes it better. Watch it and you will love it!!!!"
5,The Boondock Saints *Drools*,"This movie would have to be my best most favourite movie, next would have to be The Rock.This movie is very awesome, action packed and very well done.I dont know if everyone would like this movie, but people have surprised me."
5,"Irishman, Hitman, and an arsenal of action","Indeed, Boondock Saints is one of my all time favorites! Enough action to support a superhero-like plot and plenty of drama to entice women. All in all i give Boondock Saints 5 stars because everyone should see this fantastic film."
3,Boondock Saints review,My son insisted that we watch Boondock Saints...his all time favorite movie. We gave it to him as a gift. It was good.Ordering issue...I recieved 2 copies of the DVD and was charged for both.
3,"Not ""like New"" as listed","Received the DVD ok, but it has many surface scratches on it for being listed as ""like new"" or more than I was expecting. I am giving as a Christmas gift so I sure hope it works !!!!!"
5,Now I have to go and buy it again...,"I saw this by accident and it grabbed me instantly. This is one of the most controversial screen stories ever, boosted by great action. I'm against any organized religion, but this I can understand and... Nah, I don't want to spoil it for you.Buy it! See it! Love it or hate it!The plot in a sentence: two fraternal twins are on a mission from God (no less!) to eradicate Boston of organized crime.Direction is beautiful, story telling is complex, yet very clear and understandable. What about action, you say? Well, shoot-outs can hold its ground even against John Woos Hong Kong ""bullet ballets""...Did I mention humour? Tons of it, if you like a bit odd, a bit sick, non PC humour...The only thing that may bother you a bit is a lot of shouting, but this is over the top movie with over the top performances.I already own an imported copy, but I'll buy it again because of the special features which are missing on import DVD (which I'll give to my friend as a present)..."
2,Highly Overrated,"I found ""The Boondock Saints"" highly overrated. I watched it after hearing a lot of good things about the movie, but to me it's just a cheesy Quentin Tarentino knock-off. My suggestion: rent the movie before you buy it. You may really enjoy it, as it seems many other people have, but I ended up really disappointed."
1,Unwatchably bad - prepare for a lot of fast forwarding,"There is an actor in this movie that looks like the actor Willem Dafoe and is apparently named Willem Dafoe, but can't possibly be the real Willem Dafoe, because any actor that was worth a damn would not have anything to do with this crappy movie unless they were being blackmailed or had to finance a bad gambling or drug addiction.I'll leave it at that."
1,"Sorry, didn't work for me.","I watched the version of this film where the acting was terrible, the plot didn't exist, and every attempt at being cool failed. I'd like to get ahold of the version everyone is raving about though, sounds like a good movie."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I would only reccomend this movie to those who truly appreciate the worst of the entertainment world. By the back of the movie one would assume this movie has an extensive plot line, and holds perhaps a message that would be hard to obtain. This of course would make the movie interesting, and with the cast (especially Defoe,) it should be rather great. Instead you get a movie with a homowierdual Defoe and a plot line about as complex as a pokemon cartoon. It is also full of horrible oneliners, very choppy scenes, and unrealistic portrayal of law enforcement. I was very dissapointed, very dissapointed indeed."
2,"Sometimes, when choosing a movie,","I want to see things blown up, a mounting body count and a bloody hero triumphing unrealistically over extreme evil. It was with such thoughts that I rented this movie. But....while this movie was obviously made with real enthusiasm and good humour, it was done so cheaply, and edited so badly that it becomes a game of count the goofs, rather than watch the movie. The plot was definitely thin, the dialog mostly fbombs, and the acting by Dafoe, one of my favorites, simply stunk. Too bad, the movie missed all the way around."
2,not very,don't care for the movie. i've had it for months and still haven't seen the whole thing. ho hum booooring.
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I heard a few good comments about this movie, waited until the price dropped to buy, I did it and now I regret it. First, acting is bad, the plot is terrible, and no to mention the editing. Save yourself a few dollars and do not buy it. It's not even worth watching it for free."
1,Not good,"I am not sure if I saw the same movie as most of the people who have reviewed Boondock Saints on this site. This movie was just what I feared it would be: poorly acted, boring and way over the top. Luckily I rented it first because watching it once was way more than enough. If you want a stylish, film with a great plot and engrossing dialogue don't watch this one. Check out Fight Club or Memento or The Usual Suspects or any Coen Bros. film. Leave Boondock Saints alone."
1,Everyone needs to calm down,"In the battle of style over substance, substance didn't even show up for this one. That can be fine, but the style of this movie is ugly, mindless, and derivative. It is true that there is fancy camera work, and a number of impressively loud speeches are shouted between shootouts. The director seems overjoyed for the chance to make this movie, sweeping around and extravagently showing guns blazing while. Somehow this enthusiasm has blinded people to the complete lack of any other redeeming quality: the acting and plot are intensely bad. This movie isn't just empty of quality, it's full of stinking, rotten, cheese."
1,stupid nonsense,Utter and complete tripe. Two young actors playing at being tough - both of which look like the kind that got beat up at recess; and a disgraceful Willem Defoe - a homosexual cop that calls others fags - just so you know he's one of the good homosexuals - a regular guy and all. A shame and joke.
1,I was in no way prepared for this movie's sheer awfulness,"I watched this based on the ""you HAVE to see this movie!"" recommendations of two people I know. I no longer trust their taste or judgment on anything whatsoever. The combination of the self-indulgent violence with pretentious pseudo-philosophical moralizing made me want to puke at times. These things made me think of The Matrix movies; the unbelievably bad scenery-chewing from everyone on screen made me think of The Black Dahlia. We have here an Unholy Trinity of Cinematic Crap.And why does Dafoe's character listen to opera, and why is this supposed to provide some insight into his character? Is it because gay men listen to opera? Shouldn't he be listening to show tunes instead? Maybe it's because Troy Duffy can't tell the difference. Who knows. All I do know is that it has been quite some time since I hated a movie-watching experience this much. Bleccch!"
5,excellent movie,"my friend told me about this movie and he said it was awesome. i finally saw it and i fully agreed with him. it is by far one of the best movies i have seen. if you dont mind alot of killing and swearing, rent or buy this movie.!!!"
5,Boondock Saints,Awesome movie. Lots of action and love the way the humor is in this movie. Lmao. The interaction between the characters is awesome. Troy Duffy did a great job picking out the actors for this movie.
4,Boondock review...,"""The Boondock Saints"" is a cult classic. Watching it made ""...Saints II..."", all the better. It is an action, dark comedy, suspense thriller that I believe you will enjoy."
4,Everyone's Irish On St. Patty's Day!,"Excellent dark comedy/drama/action movie that really delivers. Much more original and intelligent than most of the movies this one is said to copycat, Boondock Saints it witty, clever and filled with comedy. The relations between the two McManus brothers is very realistic, and very believeable.One of the main highlights of this movie to me, was the performance by Willem Dafoe. He plays the role of a homophobic, gay FBI agent. His character is complex, multi-dimension and full of excellent dialog. Simply perfect performance!This movie is for anyone who likes action/crime/comdey or even a dramatic film. Top notch acting, excellent scenery and superb directing by Troy Duffy. Check this movie out.9 out of 10"
5,boondock saints,"This is one of the best movies i've ever seen... it doesn't have as much action as movies like ""the rock"" or ""T2"" but the action scenes it does have are done so marvelously that you cannot resist. the slow motion set to the music makes you shake in your seat... its undescribable how good this movie is... i don't know where the people who rate it as a 1 of 5 are getting that from... but don't listen to them... this almost unkown movie is one of the best movies in the last ten years... my only complaint is the acting during the closing credits... especially the two guys being interviewed who argue with eachother... i would think a better closing could have been concieved... perhaps just the father son talk would have been enough... i think that would have left everybody satisfied"
4,doing evil to achieve good?,"I didn't know what I was getting into when I first saw this film. It had me crawling up the back of my seat in the theater, and elicited more than a few visceral yawps. Stylized, intelligent violence is something we should all be more ambivalent about, but it is a fitting device for this film. Two characters stumble into a career exacting God's justice, and never doubt either that God's providence is at work in them or that they are a lesser form of the scum they eliminate. It confronts directly the use of vigilante violence for the sake of justice, something that has become more complicated for us after September 11."
4,Special Edition,"I had to order this region 1 version with all the extras, as it's not available in the UK. Which is why I give it 4 stars. I love this film and love the DVD. Excellent commentaries from both Director and Billy Connolly. There's also deleted scenes, one or two outtakes, filmographies, a trailer and a printable script."
5,Absolutely love this movie!,"How did it ever take me this long to see this movie? I worked in a movie store when I was younger, have had a subscription to Netflix for years, and I only finally watched this movie a few weeks ago? I loved it! Willem Dafoe is excellent in this movie, as were Sean Partick Flanery and Norman Reedus. I know that there have been a few comparisons to Tarantino in these reviews on Amazon, but I can honestly say that I'm not a huge fan of Tarantino films and while I can see where some might compare Boondock to Tarantino films, don't write this movie off if you don't like Tarantino.Yes it has blood, violence, language etc. If you are easily offended by A LOT of those things, well then, don't watch it! If not, I highly recommend it-Oh, and it's not just a movie that guys will enjoy. I'm a 30-something female and I just bought it for myself. Not my husband. Me."
1,"Mindless, unrealistic violence, unconvincing characters, and an amateurish script","Where to begin...1. The characters are unconvincing, uninteresting, and overused movie stereotypes.2. The plot barely makes any sense. There is virtually no character development which convincingly explains why two people would go on a killing spree.3. The story seems to have come from the mind of a pre-pubescent video gamer.4. A pretentious overtone.I cant even continue writing this, the entire movie sucked so bad that its too hard to even describe. Watching this was like having 5 other mediocre shoot em ups chewed up and spat out onto a DVD. There is a reason this movie got 20% on Rotten Tomatoes."
1,"WORST MOVIE EVER, HANDS DOWN","SAVE YOURSELF THE AGONY AND DON'T BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT PLEASANTVILLE WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER, I WAS WRONG."
2,An undeserving cult classic,"There's something about this movie that makes me physically ill. It's not the violence. I can handle as much violence as you can throw at me. Instead, it's the puppydog adoration that people follow this movie around with. It just isn't very good. It isn't horrible, but there are much MUCH better Tarantino knockoffs out there. Way of the Gun has better writing, a better soundtrack, and better fight scenes. Things to do in Denver When You're Dead is a much moodier film with a better atmosphere and far superior performances. I mean, you can always go and watch GOOD movies, but if you want an action movie, these are the ones to watch. This film basically has Willem Dafoe playing the same character he's played in every movie, no storyline, and depressingly cheasy plot developments. And there's a sequel coming out. I hate everyone who loves this movie. Screw you all. Hell, even Killing Zoe's better than this."
3,May offend some,Bought as a gift by request. If you are offended by foul language this dvd is not for you. Basis of movie was good and could have been just as good without every other word being so raw.
1,"Great Movie, Buy Different DVD","My family and I have loved this movie for years. I bought this special edition when it first came out. The special features aren't worth anything, there's one joke on it and that's really it. If you want to see the trailer, go on youtube. Other than that you can find this movie in double packs with other movies like Snatch for $10, or just the DVD for $5. I know it seems dramatic, but I flushed over twenty dollars on my copy and then got it for the rest of my family for 5 a piece."
4,Defoe is Great!,Defoe is over the top in this violent story of righteous vigilantes. Worth it just to watch him strutt his stuff.
2,Boondoc Saints,Extremely disappointed in this item. This was a gift for my partner and when we went to watch the bluray disk (on a playstation 3) we had an error message saying that we had the wrong region and the disk was not compatable. I also purchased Boondock Saints 2 and that disk worked perfectly.Very unhappy
5,One of the greatest cult films ever.,"I love this movie, each time I watch it, it feels like it's better, kind of like Pulp Fiction. I can't wait for the sequel to come out."
2,Script writers had a tentative grasp of the English language.,"While I understand that there will be some level of cursing in movies this movie was pretty much a long string of the F-bombs mingled with a few other lines. Really, we have an entire language with which to express ourselves, and even the most intellectually inept have the ability to stumble through some semblance of the English language without resorting to the F-bomb every other word. So the concept of the movie I liked, justice being served, fighting bad guys etc. But I just feel their script writer had virtually no imagination and filled those area's when he could have built up dialog by just having them repeat the F word over and over. So just be warned, this might not be idea for a family movie night. Unless of course your concept of depth and success is measured by how many times you can drop the F-bomb while conveying an idea in a single basic sentence."
3,"Good company and quality, small and expensive bag","I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be. Especially since starch is somewhat light, and since it was $8. I wish they sold this in larger quantities."
2,Barry Farms,"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable."
4,"Largely Excellent, Especially the Prose Poems","Hass' strength as a prose poet shows in this book--his prose poems are stunning, their stories sharp and beautifully told. While I found some of the non-prose poems in the latter half of the book to be a bit out of control and rambling (this may be a personal bias of mine; I often find Hass' longer poems tiring and repetitive), the poems in the first half of the book are tightly woven. I would recommend this book on the basis of the prose poetry alone, but there is plenty of other fine work here as well. Two Thumbs (both of mine) Up!"
3,Bob Marley & Friends Box Set,"Three discs. 50,49,48 min. each approximately. This collection of tracks is all Bob-nothing-but-Bob. While the songs,taken individually, are good,this is just to much of a ""good"" thing. Artists range from Rita Marley to Judy Mowatt to Peter Tosh to Marcia Griffiths and so on. While all the people here were connected with Bob Marley,you get the feeling that this is a way to cash in on the Marley name. All the people here were session musicians on the Jamaican scene. Yes, Marley and the Wailers were singing/playing in the background on some of these tracks but the focus of this set comes off a bit fuzzy. While the listener will find tracks to his liking,taken as a whole this should be relegated to the bottom of the list as far as Trojan/Marley purchases."
4,Good informative facts about nutrition,"This is a book I brought while I was competitively bodybuilding. It is not a book you buy to set up a nutrition plan/diet. It explains the benefits of putting certain things in your diet. It's really written for someone who is into competitive bodybuilding. If you are looking for a good healthy diet this book is not for you. If you want to know more facts about vitamins, fats, calories, etc. than you would be interested in this book."
1,very un informative,is book has just the basic things not worth buying as are all the dr squat books all the books are very uninformative they just revert to untruthful science and none logic and make no sense at allgo for the nautilus nutrition book it has unbiased veiws and hels yu separate fact from fiction
3,alright but could be better,"this book is about a person, with many diffuclties. It kept me interested for about 20 min., then i couldn't take it any more. I was forced to read this book by my grandmother, if i had a choice i would not read it. If you like books by this author you may like this one. This is the first book i've read by this author and did not enjoy it. It was alright, but could of been better."
5,This was such a wonderful book. Recommend to everyone.,Wow this was just a great book. Anytime you want to spend a day relaxing & enjoying than grab this book. It is just great!
4,Synopsis,"The IRS as seen from the inside. Diogenes is the pseudonym for an Internal Revenue agent who doesn't blame taxpayers for cheating.Diogenes asserts that at least half of American taxpayers cheat on their taxes at some time or another and here outlines popular methods used to hoodwink the IRS, including the Instant-Doctor Ploy, the Ghost Gambit, the Rental Razzle-Dazzle and the Phantom-Burglar Ploy. Includes advice on how to be audited, how you can pick up reward money by tattling on your boss, and how and how not to bribe a revenue agent."
4,bought it for class,"I bought this text for class and find that it is a helpful text for introductory studies of eschatology, the study of the end times"
3,Better Than I Thought it Might Be,"It's a low-budget spooker, but ""The Nun"" was actually better than I thought it would be. The actors were very good, the story moved along nicely, and there were some interesting plot points that added to the overall story. The killing scenes were brief, and the nun herself -- in all her hideous watery glory -- was actually done well. The ending was a little disappointing because it seemed rather ""rushed"", but otherwise I enjoyed this film. You don't to buy this one, but it's a good escapist view for an hour or so. It's certainly better than a lot of so-called horror films out there."
3,The Nun,It was a good movie could have been better I believe they should have focused on the abuse angle more.
2,ok\not the best,"In this video ash battles his friend misty.he ends up winning (like all of the other episodes) but the point was pretty dull.if you ""got to catch them all"" you will like this moive. if you are a pokemon lover but dont have to have all of the pokemon items i reccomend not dealing with it espesally because you can watch it on tv every morning.there have been better pokemon episodes like:i choose you pikachu(witch you can buy off amazon),squritle squad,the one about charmander or balbasour and the hidden village. i reccomend you saving your money and buy the better episodes."
5,I like Pokemon and this movie is cool!!!!!,"I bought this movie and thought it was cool until I realized, ""This Movie Doesn't Have the Right Voices"". Even though it didn't have the same voices on some of the episodes. I LIKED IT!!!!! So I gave it 5 stars. This one is worth checking out. All of the movies have the full length Pokerap!!!"
4,Okay I guess!,Okay I guess. I liked the first one but the second one I hate because the kid looses Shandshrew. I really liked it though when Pikachu made that funny face at Cubone.
4,Robert Calvert - 'Test Tube Conceived' (Thunderbolt),"To my delight,'Test Tube...' was actually better than I had expected.If fact,I'll say that it's 'nearly' as good as his landmark 'Captain Lockheed...' reissue lp(see my review).This was Calvert's final solo outing prior to his death in 1988.Calvert's lyrics here are surprisingly witty and sharp.The music is very well written.Tunes I liked the most were ""I Hear Voices"",the title track ""Test Tube Conceived"",the catchy ""Telekenesis"" and ""On Line"".This title may be hard to find,but it's worth the effort."
1,It took 6 months to show up,I ordered this so I could move. I received a notice 4 months after I moved that the product was shipping. I never saw this arrive.
4,Review products,"All products came timely and you can't beat the prices, the rocky shirt has that vintage look. any blackshhep item I loveand try to collect."
4,Not Quite Berlin...,"This is a solid album, but it really is more a continuation of Nunn's solo career, lacking the distinctive songwriting contribution of John Crawford. Buy this if you're a fan of Terri Nunn's singing, not of Berlin's quirkier vision."
3,"Not a bad album, but the expectations killed it.","After Kai Hansen left Helloween (in their very peak), the expectations were too high. The Keepers's success was too much. In the end, the ""different"" music of Pink Bubbles couldn't do it and everyone was pretty dissapointed.Pink Bubbles shows a whole different kind of riffs, not very close to power-metal standards, and that was a major mistake at that time. In the other hand, the lyrics don't tell stories about heroes or mystical stuff, they're way too far from that.Highlights: Kids Of The Century, Someone's Crying, The Chance, Your Turn (a nice ""power-ballad"")."
3,not the best but good,"well, pink bubbles isnt the best album they have since there's not that usual heavy helloween sound in it, but this album is ok. When someone is crying is probably the best song in this album."
2,Story of the Storyteller,"Geoffrey Giuliano's biography of Rod Stewart, Vagabond Heart, is a mildly interesting account of the more flamboyant performers in rock. Between the liaisons and marriages to beautiful women and his image as a hard partier, you would expect a livelier story, but Mr. Giuliano writes in such a laconic style, that you are almost put to sleep. This is really only for ardent Rod Stewart fans as unfortunately there are barely any literary works on this superb performer."
1,This book is chock full of errors,"Amazon reviews are meant to sell book so this review will never see the light of day, but the fact is, this book is full of errors--dates are wrong, songs are listed on wrong CDs, and it is full of sensationalism. The only books worth reading on Rod Stewart are John Gray's ""Visual Documentary,"" Ray Coleman's ""Rod Stewart the Biography"" and 1999's ""Every Picture Tells a Story."" (in that order)."
5,Just what we wanted,My son is fascinated with Mickey Mouse and Goofy. This is great for him to sleep with at night. Thanks bunches
1,D-link customer service is aweful. This router breaks.,"I purchased this router for my office. It lasted 4 months. Called D-link. They would replace, but would not send me a new one till they had this one in hand. Their bad product, but I'm the one not to be trusted.Replacement finally came. Lasted about 4 months. Repeat.3rd replacement has now gone bad, and no more replacements from their third world customer service. I can't be down in my office this much. I will never have a D-link product again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"When I hear the word ""networking,"" I reach for my gun, to paraphrase. Trying to get this network to WORK has been endleesly, needlessly frustrating. Calling their ""service"" center is an amazing adventure in dealing with people with (I swear this is true) profound speech defects; but understandable or not, the whole system's installation, prompts, wizards are useless. I followed the connection directions (both printed and on their equally opaque CD) and when walked step-by-step through it by the Help Desk person, we got it working by REVERSING the wiring recommended by the manufacturer. Second call wrestled with a problem with WAP codes (what demented geniuses think these things up?) that, while extremely simple, wasn't mentioned anywhere in the documentation. Now, third day in, the network has simply stopped running...between Microsoft's oblivious wizards and DLink's useless directions, the unit is worthless. Never again."
1,Double Trouble,"I bought two of these routers for my computer business. I sold one to a customer who complained of it not working a few days after I installed it. Because I sold the equipment, I came out to troubleshoot, free of charge. I eventually discovered that this unit will not work properly after the power is unplugged. It must be reconfigured, even though all the settings are the same! I went through 2 of these with the same customer and eventually bought a Belkin. I am EXTREMELY disatisfied with this router and will not be purchasing D-Link equipment anymore."
1,Rubbish!!,"Why is it that I randomly get disconnected and cannot get back on the wifi no matter what I do. I tried static ip, then setting the firewall to the loosest settings and nothing. I mean cmon, wtf, this is a piece of utter rubbish."
5,Good router,"It took me all of about ten minutes to install this router into my network. It is as straight forward as any install could be. My old router was a hassle to install, and never worked as good as this one does, but that one was a G format, this one is the newer N type format.Within ten minutes of opening the box I was looking at Youtube videos with the laptop in the other end of the house, which is something you could never do with the previous router. Nothing else was changed, and it is a night a day difference. Best of all we did not have to call support, it just installed itself basically, all we did was attach the appropriate wiring.At the price we paid here on Amazon, you cannot go wrong with this router with Windows 7 Premium Home Edition."
1,I will NEVER buy D-Link again!,"This is the worst computer product I've used or owned in 23 years. The install CD is supposed to auto-launch. It doesn't. The ""Quick Installation Guide"" is so brief it is useless. The online support/FAQs say nothing about the CD problem, though telephone support says this is a known issue. ""Oh, don't worry sir. That's why we're here. So you can call us for help."" Oh, I know! How 'bout D-Link fixes this ""known issue"" instead of boasting that I can call their tech support. I don't want to call, I want a working product. (Not to mention it took over ten minutes to get past all the non-essential questions from tech support. Had to spell my name 8 times! Had to give my email address 11 times! Wow."
1,dont buy this router.,d-link dir 615 wireless n-router is not a good router to spend money.this router cant not hold dpor every 5 minutes
5,Great wireless router,"I had to buy a router because Verizon replaced my modem with one that was not compatible with my old router (Motorola). I remember the problem that I had installing and getting all my wireless things to work with the old one and was NOT looking forward to doing it again. Supringly, the D-Link router plugged in and worked seamlessly with my wireless components. My laptop worked with no adjustments at all. My Wii wireless installed with just a change of password. My DSi worked immediately. The only problem that I had was my two old Nintendo DS systems. I called tech support, and within 5 minutes they told me what to do to correct it, and it has been working like a dream since. I would strongly recommend this router to anyone who just needs wireless for a laptop, game system, etc. It is truly Plug 'N Play."
1,return,"Unfortunately, this piece of equipment had to be returned because it didn't work properly. I did call D_link for support and someone spent a bit of time with me trying to get it up and running, however, it didn't stay connected. I even had a computer Tech here for another computer that needed repair and he looked at this connection too and while it was properly connected; it just didn't work. I am not sure if it was the product or just a defective item."
3,a little disapointing,"range is short, sometimes disconnected as Linksys and Motorola does.I need to keep looking for a better wireless router."
1,Destined for scrap heap,"I had one of these for six months. I had to update the firmware to get the thing to work. After six months, it completely died. No lights, no nothing. It was covered under warranty, but I didn't save my receipt (I only file my receipts for major purchases), and I would have had to pay shipping costs and suffer the downtime anyway. The moral: You get what you pay for. Buy a good router and you'll be rewarded. Buy this at your own risk."
3,Decent for the price,I have to say that I was frustrated at first as I got a lot of disconnections and the speed was at the g ranges. I called dlink's support which made me tweek some of the settings. It is now stable at speeds of 75mbs to 110mbs which is better than G. My PC is about 30ft away from the router with two walls and one floor seperating the two so I assume that's the reason I don't get higher speeds.
3,Good,It works as I exspected it to. Had a liitle bit of a hard time setting up at first. But all work out OK.
1,Garbage,"Had this product for 4 days and can't keep it running for more than 5 hours at a time before having to reset the router. Once reset, goes back to working fine, BUT CAUSES A MASSIVE HEADACHE."
2,Horrible Router,"I picked up this router without doing much research, and that's the last time I'm ever going to do that. When it worked, it was great, but it would often kill the signal (wired and wireless) and require a restart. However, I could live with having to restart it every now and then, but just the other day it died. I picked up this router in September of last year, and I could only make it as for as 6 months. In short, this router is now worse than my 5 year old Linksys router. Now I'm left stranded with 6 devices (4 wired/2 wireless) with only a connection from my modem. With that said, I'm heading out right now to find a replacement. I've never gone through a router this fast. Avoid this model at all costs, unless you don't have to share your internet connection."
1,dont buy it,"this is a piece of crap, don't waste your money on it. It keep resetting itself with no reason, and it take 5-6 minute to reset every time, very annoying."
4,"Disappointed... I thought ""N"" routers were beter than ""G""??","I jumped on this router during the ""cyber monday"" deals in order to upgrade from a ""G"" router.. my criticism resides in comparison with my 5yr old LinkSys WRT54GS2 and its comparative coverage as well as difficulty getting me/my wife smart phones to link to it's WiFi signal - it says it's linked but the web/streams just won't work. The only positive I can give it so far is our laptop shows 50+ mb/sec., but if I can't get our phones to work I will have no choice but to go back to the LinkSys for now and possibly return this one.. disappointed. I had planned to dd-wrt the old one and use it as a wirless adapter for my plasma/BlueRay.. obviously that is on hold.From my experience the old adage applies here, too good to be true :(Edit; got the phone issue fixed and has served us well for months w/ no problems - changed the rating to 4 stars to reflect this.."
2,Newer revisions don't have detachable atennas!,"I bought this router because I needed to upgrade to high-gain antennas in my house to get acceptable signal everywhere, and Internet reviews of the DIR-615 specifically mention that it has external antennas that I could swap out for high-gain ones. Unfortunately this is only true for older versions of the router -- D-Link killed this important feature without changing the part number, only making a tiny footnote on their product specifications page. So I will now have to pay return shipping and buy a router whose external antennas are ACTUALLY removable."
1,Drops connection constantly,Our DIR-615 drops wireless connectivity constantly (several times daily). I was dropping every few minutes before I did a firmware upgrade. D-link's tech support was no help--they admitted that the DIR-615 Rev C had this problem out of the box and that they were working on it. But why are they selling a product that has a major known issue? This router is a very bad choice.
1,Not worth the price...,"I bought my DIR-615 in November '07. By April '08 it died just like so many others reported. Before that, we went through a period of intermittent signal drops. I searched D-Link's website for solutions and couldn't find one. I emailed tech support and got back a dumb response. Since I didn't keep my receipt and really need to get my network back up, I went out and bought a new Linksys WRTG54S and a Belkin G Router (I use the Belkin as an Access Point to extend my wi-fi coverage). Both have kept up with our networking needs without a glitch and they're in the same price range (less the free PCMCIA N card).My recommendation, avoid the D-Link if not tech-savvy. If you don't mind playing network system administrator, go right ahead and buy this headache. By the way, there is a fix for the dead DIR-615 which is pretty simple (involves reloading the firmware). See earlier comments for the steps."
1,Stay Away - Good for Browsing and Thats It!,"Bought this in September for use in my apartment. It works fine when browsing but completely drops your connection if you attempt to do any heavy downloading. Turns out that this router has a 32 connection max. So, if you use bittorrent to download the latest linux distro, be prepared for your internet to cut out within 10 minutes. I have to restart the router every time this happens. Spend the extra money and get any of the other routers which allow over 200 connections."
3,Problems with iphone 3G,"This is a pretty descent n draft router for the price. Setup was a bit problematic as the setup cd didn't work on my windows 7 profesional 64 bit system, so I had to manually configure it, which is very simple if you know what you are doing, but if you aren't technically proficient, then you'll be making a call to the shoe fairies in India."
2,Average Product,I really don't know what to say for this product. Even though both my Internet Connection & Vonage connection works through this Router but I am not able to make it work as wireless connection.Even they have given some manuals and a CD but it is of not much help as even after doing all the things suggested by them still my Wireless connection is not working as per expected.So I really don't have that much good opinion about this product quality.
3,Decent router,"The rev. version that I received is E1, which is not supported by DD-WRT. So if you want a DD-WRT supported router, this is not the one. The router itself often drop connection and it is really annoying."
3,Touchy,"Install wizard is garbage,does not work. Forget about using the CD. Good speed. Likes to change it's name and go offline. Had it for 3 weeks, and had to rebuild from scratch 2 times."
1,DONT BUY THIS ROUTER!!!!! LISTEN TO THIS,"This router was perfect for the 1st month that I had it then it began to act up. I kept getting randomly disconnected from the WiFi and it wasn't connecting again! This happened on my phone and laptop. I had to keep unplugging it and then plug it back in and that was really time consuming and annoying. Then another month later it kept disconnecting like 2 times per day and it was so ***** annoying, even my mom threw this stupid retarded router on the ground. DONT BUY THIS ROUTER! I bought Factory Refurbished Cisco Linksys E2500 for $45 from amazon and it was way faster, better range and it was dual band and it was way better than this crappy d-link router! Never using d-**** routers ever again for the problems it gave me!"
1,not good,"i used the item for less than one year, now it doesn't work.I have to reset it for more than 10 times per day."
1,couldn't rate it zero stars,"I would have rated this router at zero stars, but that doesn't appear to be an option. It spontaneously reboots about every 10 or 15 minutes. I turned on debugging in the logfile. From the messages there it appears that dhcpc sends a reset signal to rc which actually resets the router. I consider myself relatively technical (BSEE, MSCS), so I don't think it's me. I run 2 desktops (windows7 and Fedora17), a laptop on windows7, a laptop I dual boot, and a netbook on Fedora17. All worked fine with my old (and might I add, free) dell router. This router just doesn't work. I'm returning it, and will hunt for something better."
4,D-Link DIR-615 Wireless N Router - excellent shipper and faster service,"I Received my "" D-Link DIR-615 Wireless N Router"" as per schedule and device is working in excellent conditionprice is economy and worth of it."
3,Hard to setup,"I spent all afternoon trying to get this thnig to work. First I used the CD program; no luck. Then I tried just cabling everything and turning it on afterward. Nothing.Finally I powered everything off, including the computer, and the powered up this order: Modem, Router, and finally computer. Voila! All works, and the other computers on the router also worked OK.It is VERY dependent on precise procedure to initialize.Once started, though, it performs just as well as the former D-Link (non wireless) unit I had before.I haven't tried the wireless part yet, because I do not have any wireless equipment yet.All in all a good buy for Amazon's low price and free shipping."
3,worked 15 days,"15 days it worked perfectly, I can create a networkbut does not connect to internet, I think it's thedevice, because I know some networks and others personshave tried and not work."
3,Might not work with some drivers...,"When I received this router it was great, easy setup and security. I tried to connect several of my computers one that had a dlink N adapter which I hooked up to it first and I got blazing fast speeds out of the box. The only problem is that some of the other wireless cards wouldn't connect but it worked with my primary so I stayed with it."
1,Extremely Unstable,"This device is extremely unstable and often kicks me out of my own network. In addition, it is much slower than routers I have had that cost half as much."
3,Do not buy this router,"I have used this router for a little over a year now. Router is very easy to install and setup. However, the connection drops very often. It drops connections at least once every hour, and it reconnects in 15-30 seconds later. After using this router for about a year now, the router freezes as well. When this happens, I have to unplug the power for the router as well as my cable to restart the whole system."
5,"Wireless, yes",I had this router for 7 weeks now and had no problems. I found it easy enough to set it up myself. I had no need for tech support yet. No extra cables were required for my netbook and my other computer. But I did use a cable to connect a printer.
5,Easy to use,Just install over this weekend and installation was very easy. no problem at router but problem on workstation side where only show 54Mbtis because wireless 802.11a/b/g so need to purchase wireless n usb to replace. Very good product.
1,Random connectivity loss; died after 3 years,"The wireless connection randomly fails. Out of the box there was a firmware issue.I flashed it with open-source firmware (DD-WRT) and it worked much better for a couple years, but connectivity was always somewhat flaky until it finally died after 3 years of use.Meanwhile, the Linksys WRT54GL that I previously purchased in 2006 is still going strong 6 years later and never had any problems. Too bad Linksys's reliability went downhill with their newer N-wireless products."
2,Maybe works for some,"Very weak device, Perhaps works in US paper houses but for Brick, Cement, Concrete made houses... it is trash.Maybe one wall it can handle but even though the signal goes down. Two walls, signal disappears.So if you live in paper houses, maybe it fits,If you live in dungeouns like me, keep your old Linksys 54G."
3,Does not run in N mode,"Have an Intel N wireless adapter in my laptop that connects only at 54mps, even when right next to the device. All my drivers are up to date cannot be bothered to figure it out. Devices this simple should just work."
1,All One-Star Ratings Are True For This Router D-Link,"I had this router, dlink, bought in december 2009. I wrote this review only now (07/26/2010), hoping thar I may find a solution and have it shared but it went in vain. I don't want to re-type all the one-star ratings review. They're all true - had those problems - had it fixed - then back to those problems again. (Mainly looses connection). I have to blame myself for buying this unit for not heeding the large number of one-star review back then. I have now the impression (just decided) not to buy any d-link products anymore. I bought linksys (refurbished), which is cheaper ($34.00) and it worked far better than d-link. After installation, no ""No Connection"" problem ever experience again with linksys."
1,Don't like it,"Maybe because I am using comcast Blast! and IPV6, the router cannot tolerate my speed! I think the router is quite broken, it get rebooted automatically after days, maybe because the heat when the cpu was busy. I then bought another router more than $100, it was quite good. So I think I don't suggest buying DIR615"
3,Great... at times,I was tricked by the low price... The router is good except about once a week I have to reset it otherwise... it won't work... other reviews seem similar...
1,"Good Features, Terrible Reliability","Features are great, when it works. The router frequently drops connections and must be rebooted before anything will work again. D-Link forums are full of people with the same issue, but no fix has been forthcoming."
2,so-so router,Router is okay. Usually works but several pc's had trouble keeping a connection although they worked fine with my older 54mbps Netgear router. I have several different wireless network adapters and some work better than others with this router even though they all worked fine with the netgear router.
2,Router DIR-615 does not work properly,I bought and Installed. I wanted to replace my 4 years old CompUsa G router with this N router. First I did the same setup as my old router My Internet worked with LAN connection. Wireless wise I had three laptop with G connection and two worked one dropped connection every few second. My VOIP phone did not work. I try to open the port through the setup for VOIP and did not work. I did research in the google and D-link site and look like many D-Link modem is having the same problem. I did my best to solve the problem and after two weeks I gave up and hooked up my old router all my Laptop and VOIP phone is working very well. I do not recommend this company router for any body.
1,D-Link Router,"D-Link DIR-615 4-Port 10/100 Mbps Wireless N RouterAfter spending several days trying to get this router to work, I returned it because it was not compatable with AT&T; DSL. I purchase a 2-wire modem from AT&T; and was up and running in 20 minutes."
5,"Cheap price, yet works perfectly.","Couldn't believe the price of this wireless router at $23. It was recommended by the IT guy where I work. For such a cheap price, it works perfectly. I have not tried it in a wide area, but for a small place, it works quite well."
1,Not plug-and-play,"Setup was easy, but the signal kept getting dropped on all of my devices, which would reconnect without serious trouble. I reset the router and was able to install the latest firmware, which fixed the connection issues, but as of this writing will NOT connect to my G-laptop despite changing the settings to B/G/N or G/N. DO NOT buy this for someone who lacks basic technical skills!"
2,This router is wimpy,"I read lots of products descriptions before I ordered this router. I found it very hard to configure. After what seemed like two hours of frustrating attempts to set it up, it finally began working. I don't know how I did it. The real problem is that it is not powerful enough to let me use my computer troughout my 2100 square foot, two-story house. It is a real disappointment."
3,Great for small homes,"This router was easy to use and set up, but it is designed for a small house or apartment. Its range would reach my lower floor but not go through any closed doors. If you need a strong single for two stories I would get a stronger unit. I just ordered the 655 model and hope it will do the job."
2,not what I expected,"I wanted a router that had good coverage in the house.Product description was ""....... Intelligent Antenna technology to transmit multiple streams of data which enables you to receive wireless signals in the farthest corners of your home. Not only does the D-Link Wireless N 300 technology extend your wireless range,.......""This is not the case. Very poor signal. Also could not connect to Apple devices. They could see the router (if I was close to the router) but could not connect to the network."
1,I run servers and after 4 hours of trying to get my server to run i gave up,"I run servers, specifically mw3 servers currently and after 4 hours of trying I simply couldnt get what I needed done. I changed every setting in the router I could. Not only that, we got this new router to improve are terrible wireless signal we had b4 with another dlink and this one actualy was worse some how then are 3 years old one. I definitely highly do not recommend getting this, after 5 minutes using the Netgear N600 WNDR 3400 my server was up and running and we had 100% wireless signal."
5,Good Router!!,Router is fairly good for the price. I have used it for months without any problems and signal is good.
1,Worked for a while and then quit,I've had two of these DIR-615 Wifi routers and they both did the same thing. They worked fine for a few months and then they stopped working and in the same way. When they stopped I could still communicated with them over the network cable and the built in configuration/web page server was working. My lap tops could see the WiFi signal but there was no connection though the gateway to the internet. Resetting the thing would put it back on line for a while but the length of time it would work before needing to be rest again would get shorter and shorter. Both units ended up in the trash can.Now I have two Asus WiFi routers and so far they work great and the signal strength is much better too.
2,Spend a little more money for a better product,"Buyer beware! I bought one of these from a big box store when I saw the low price and wanted to upgrade my old G-class router. The setup was needlessly complex and the signal coming from the DIR-615 continually fluctuated between weak and just under maximum. I suppose I could reluctantly recommend this router for those who just do light web surfing and email, but if you need a strong, fast wireless network for gaming, large downloads, work purposes, etcetera... spend more money on a better quality router."
2,Slightly better than garbage,"Picked one of these up from J&R last week...I'm pretty tech savvy and have set up several routers before, but this one took me about 7 hours over 2 days. When I entered the password for network security in the only possible box for it, it still would not recognize the pass when I would try to connect. Eventually it started working although I have no idea what I did, but it would only connect at 11 Mbps rather than 54, even if my computer was directly next to the router. The net was far too sluggish going through the router, so I sent it back for a linksys, which I had up and running perfectly in 15 min. Technically it did transmit data so I gave it better than a 1, but don't waste your time on this p.o.s."
2,Very Bad Product,"One of the worst electronic products I have owned.Installation is more complicated than with most routers.MAC filtering is set up bizarrely so that you need a PhD in engineering to use.Drops connections randomly and requires frequent restarts to keep computers connected.Have had to return two defective units in a couple of months.When this thing works, it seems like a good router, but that is the exception, not the rule."
5,Good Product,No problem with this product. Easy to configure. Just one thing firewall seem little bit weak. Indeed configuration is not so high and you can't do what you want exactly.good product
1,Poor wireless performance,"This router has a good switch, however, the wireless performance is bad. I had problems with the device dropping wireless connection so I did what everyone else does in this situation....upgraded the firmware. But guess what, after I upgraded, the wireless speed became slower! I didn't even think that was possble and am very upset! I normally can get 10-15mb, I was getting anywhere between 1-5mb. The firmware upgrade really killed the wireless performance. Shame because I liked it up to this point. I hooked back up my old reliable Linksys WRT54G and am only going to stick with Linksys for now on!"
2,not good for security....,I wouldn't recommend this router for THREE security-focused reasons:1) can only use HTTP for admin login.-- even though the manual says that you can enable HTTPS server I confirmed with DLink tech support that HTTPS login is NOT AVAILABLE on the DIR-615; this functionality starts at the DIR-655....MANUAL IS WRONG!2) can not disable admin settings from the wireless interface-- having admin access ONLY from the wired LAN would also be another security issue3) can NOT filter wireless MAC's only-- have to enter ENTIRE network MAC's if you want to filter any devices; doesn't differentiate between wire or wireless LANs for this features...So in short I can't recommend this product; I am returning it and will go back to a Linksys prodcut where ALL 3 of the features mentioned above are available.
3,Takes some tweaking then runs OK,"Was about to smash the DIR-615 rev C1 on the garage floor until I found a stable setup. Now I'm able to get my max ISP speed on the wired port & decent speed over wireless. I run my network in G only since I don't own any N equipment. The default setup did not work..slow & dropped wireless frequently as others have reported, but wired connection was always solid. After reading posts on the D-Link forums, I found a configuration that works for me:Channel 7 (forced), disable SPI firewall & WPS, WPA2/AES encryption, FW 3.11NA. Range is probably a little less than my Netgear WGT624 but still acceptable.Bottom line, don't spend more than a Jackson on this & consider newer dual band models if you want to run in mixed G/N mode."
4,good for the price,"it is a really good product, especially for the price. the only thing is i had a lot of trouble setting it up and ended up having to call tech support. they were completely helpful though and its running smoothly now. i am really good on computers so for me to have trouble with the install is unusual so be aware of that. ive had to reset it three times now too but i dont know if thats my modems fault or its. either way i would recommend it for someone with a duplex or a 2bdrm apartment."
1,"Iffy Technology, Terrible Customer Service","This router has a mind of its own and is difficult to keep up. What's worse, when it goes down and you call customer service they're worthless - if you drop of their decision chart, they hang up on you."
2,Bad news for Mac users...,"We have two PC's and one Macbook Pro with wireless connections to this router. The Windows computers work fine with it, (usually) without a hitch but my Mac mostly has problems with it. Web pages usually do not load the first time. I have to reload the page 2-3 times to finally get it to work, but even then images have a hard time loading. Really a pain to work with on a Mac."
2,It does not always stay connected,"Every couple of days I have to unplug it so it can restart, otherwise it won't allow any connections through the device.Also, it requires a specific IP address to be typed in to the network settings if you decide to have ANY network security on. I am very proficient at network adapter configuration and I even had a tech guy come out and called the D-Link technical support. Having a specific IP address is not that bad as long as you don't plan to connect to other networks, in which case you have to change your settings on your computer to ""Automatically select IP"" for whenever you are on the other network, and you have to type in your IP address, subnet mask, DNS... etc every time you come home.I wouldn't buy this again, even if it was a 1/10th of the price of the other N routers."
3,Too glitchy,"For myself this router cuts out too often and have to reconnect it.It may just be this one, I would not buy this router again."
3,Still using it,Big but it's ok because i use it for inside the home. Over time I have had to unplug and reset every so often.
1,Works badly with certain devices,"This router works fine with some devices, but others (specifically Apple devices) have major problems connecting and staying connected. The router usually has to be reset several times per day."
1,Router blocks game voice chate,"Signal strength and speed on the wireless was lower/slower than my old Linksys Wireless G router. The built-in firewall blocked my in-game Voice Chat for Everquest 2. Opening ports or moving the PC to a ""dmz"" designation made no difference. Tried it hard wired and wireless. Same problem on multiple computers so I know its the router. It's going back to the retailer. Should have stuck with my original Linksys but thought this would increase my wireles range."
5,Product Review,"This router is excellent. It took a few minutes to set up, and now is very secure. It can power multiple devices at the same time without affecting the speed. However, it does not have such a long range. Approaching 50 feet and your connection starts to get weak."
1,ka ka,"I bought this and tried to deal with it for a week. I even exchanged it for a new one, thinking that the router I bought was defective. Same problem, as follows:Connectivity with Outlook/Exchange was spotty, and would drop connections every 5 minutes.Instant Messages would also get dropped (as noted by the way the messages would route to my mobile phone as I sat in front of the computer).Other applications requiring a constant connection would also drop connections.If you need to rely upon this router to get home office / vpn tasks done, and have complete reliability, then pass on it, and get a better router.Tech support was no help in diagnosing the issue, and it appears that in order to workaround the issue, you'd have to get into some heavy customizations of the advanced rules. A router should work for above functionality out of box, without additional configuration."
1,I've never spent this much money on a turd before.,"This worked great until I moved to 6 MBPS. It crashes and locks up daily. It might be a good router for grandma, but if you have three kids and a wife streaming stuff, you probably want to look elsewhere."
1,Set up not worth it,"My rating is based solely on the difficulty I had with set up and installation. I started using the tutorial on the installatin CD, but when that came up with an error message I called tech support. I was on the phone with them for about 2 hours. I finally gave up and sent the router back. It probably performs well after it is installed, but the installation wizard didn't work for me with set up, and tech support told me it would have to be manually installed. They tried walking me through that. To make matters worse it was hard to understand the people I spoke with at tech support because of their strong foreign accents."
2,Meh.,It's a decent router for someone casually browsing the web.. Wireless speeds capped at 54Mbps even after installing ww-drt firmware. It was worth the 20 bucks I spent for using wifi on my smartphone instead of paying for 3G while at home.
4,Good wireless router for the price,The installation was easy. Had some problems connecting with an iPad2 but that was a problem with the security on the iPad2 and not the router. The router seems to be a little slow when transmitting files such as jpg pictures. My work-around is to connect directly from my computer to the cable modem and the files transfer at a much faster speed. Othe than that I am satisfied with the wireless router especially when you consider the price.
2,Bad signal strength and alot of disconnects,not a good router at all..it disconnects all the time..and always has a bad signal with the network..poor antennas..poor n network..pay extra for the better one
1,worst router ever,"this is worst router on the planet. i spent 4 hours trying to set it up, and 3 hours on the phone with tech. support. was not able to get internet access. save yourself a lot of frustration - do not purchase this. If this was the only router on the planet, i would go through life without a router."
1,dir 615,This is one of the worst electronic items I have purchased and I have made many.If your smart you will not purchase this product.
1,Not worth the money or time,"That is so funny. I thought I was the only one having problems with it. I just had bought this router one day ago and the setup is a major drag. I resetted pc a million times, i did everything on the setup cd but it will not work. This product is the worst product ever made. I also bought the usb network adapter to put in my laptop and that also doesnt work. D-Link really screwed their N products this time."
1,Not for Verizon PPPoE DSL,"I have Verizon DSL that requires userid and password (PPPoE), Linksys Wireless B worked fine before I decide to upgrade. The D-Link was problem to begin with. First, the software requires your computer to be connected to internet already, then tells you to remove the old router, so if you already put away your old router, you had to reconnet the old, then start the software, and then disconnect the old, and connect the new. How retarded is that!. Second, once the software install is completed, the internet worked, FOR 1 second. I was able to go to the first web page, that was it. Then it will not work at all. I reinstalled, and did the same thing. Not really sure where the problem is, but it kept saying that my ISP account is incorrect/inaccessible, whichled me to believe it's the userid and password issue. So I exchanged for a Belkons G Plus MIMO (same price at Target for $60) next day, which installed in 5 minutes with zero drama.worked for a split second,"
1,Could not get it to work,"I'm an IT professional, and I couldn't get this router to work. Nor could D-link tech support. A frustrating experience. I was setting up a very simple network - just a wireless laptop connection and a wired desktop using a cable modem. The D-link didn't work wireless or wired. Exchanged it for a Linksys, which took less than an hour to set up and it's working great."
1,Simply can't be worse.,"I've never wrote an review here on Amazon, but this product changed my mind, since it is SOOO bad that I feel necessary to stop everyone from buying it. It needs constant reset and the signal is never reliable. My apartment is tiny and I put this thing in the living room. Can't even browse the web at a reasonable speed in the bedroom with the door closed. Don't even think about buying this, or any other product by Dlink. Seriously."
4,I would recommend this to a friend,"After a recent purchase of a Dell netbook, I needed a wireless router. I noticed that this was the same one on the Microsoft Store web site but was cheaper through Amazon, so I bought this one. It arrived sooner than expected and has been working well for the 2 or 3 weeks I have had it. I had someone else set it up and I heard a few complaints about that but using it has been easy. I would buy it again and would recommend it to a friend."
1,Does not work with Macs,"I've had this router for a year and a half, and it works fine with my PC, but has trouble with my Mac. Reading some forums, this is a very common problem among those with Apple computers. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC. It will connect sometimes, drop your signal, then refuse to connect, and the only way to get it working is a manual reboot. A real pain in the @SS."
1,The worst router EVER,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! A relative bought this horrible router against my advice. We have a Net Gear end router which took minutes (literally) to set up and works perfectly. This D-Link thing is complicated, has WAY too many steps and you have to install the disk in every computer you want internet for! Which means all of your tablets and any device without a CD Rom can't get internet. We gave up after hours of trying to figure this thing out (and by the way we own several computers and are computer and device savvy). It is going back for a Net Gear!!"
1,bad router,"so i bought this router without warranty. regret it bad. waste 40 dollars. i disconnect so much it happens as often as every minute to hour. i cant download or upload any big files without being disconnected, bad router."
1,Piece of Junk Router,"Do not buy this router. I wasted countless hours trying to setup the router properly and followed the suggestions that other people had posted in their reviews on Amazon with no luck. The primary problem is that the connection to the internet through the router will drop after about 20 minutes of running fine. The connection will not reestablish itself and you must reboot the modem, router and computer to get internet again. After two days of trying ever possible router setup I returned the item. Stay away from this router and save yourself several days of headache."
1,Too Many Documented Issues on the Internet with the DIR-615,"Don't waste your time with this router. There are numberous documented installation issues on the Internet and the Customer Support was a total waste of time.... Attempting to upgrade from LinkSys to D-Link, after nearly 20 hours attempting to install the router I've decided to return the merchandise."
5,Good router,"I've had no problems reported by others here.I have hardware revision B2 with the latest firmware 2.25.I didn't use the software that came with it just used a browser to configure the router. I had to select wpa/aes to get n speeds on my wireless pcs.Setup took about 30 mins.UPDATESince writing my review I ran into some problems. The problem appears to be with the DHCP server on this router. Clients are unable to connect unless you have DHCP turned on on the router, if you turn on DHCP clients loose connectivity after a while.After some experimentation this is what worked for me -- Turn on DHCP- Once all your clients (PC's) acquire an ip address turn off DHCP and set the ip address on the PC's manually ( turn off DHCP on the PC but not on the router).- On the router add all your PC's to the DHCP reservations list You will find this under Network Setup.This seems to be be working for me for over a month."
1,Save Yourself,"As part of installing a network in the house with both wired and wireless machines, I contracted a local vendor to setup this wireless router. After three failed attempts to make it work we switched to a competitors brand and had no problems. In the wired mode the router was fine, but the wireless was a disaster. Not only did the router not work, but the software that comes bundled with it crashed two XP computers on the network (leaving a Win 2000 system untouched -- go figure). This router caused me several hours of headaches and the technicians even more. If I could give it a zero, I would."
1,Nothing But Problems With This Router,"Since setting up this router several months ago, I've had nothing but trouble.The router requires a re-boot at least twice each day. The router cuts off for no apparent reason. The router cuts off when the Internet is not being used; when it's being used minimally; and when it's being used to download. It doesn't matter. It will cut off.The router is properly set up, and I know how to set up a wireless network. Thus, user error cannot be blamed. (Indeed, tonight I replaced the D-Link wither another router. No problems.)I hate this thing, and it's the biggest piece-of-junk electronic device I've ever purchased.Avoid this company and device like the plague."
1,worst customer service I have ever experienced.. Don't buy !!!,"I had to install this device twice. Called customer service after the first failed installation and it was a total waste of time. Figuring out the problem myself, I installed the product. After a few days it stopped working. I uninstalled, reinstalled and went another week with the same problem.I received an email asking me to rate the customer service. I responded it was a waste of time, I couldn't understand the person talking with me (what's new about that) and reported I did not receive any help. Think I heard anything back from this company? Nothing !!All I can do as a consumer is tell people that this may be an ok product but if it doesn't work don't expect any help from D-Link. I will never buy another product from this company. Hope this helps others before they experience the frustration I have experienced."
2,Not worth the money,"I thought the price was great and the d-link system was highly recommended. It took 3 or 4 tries to install it and then I fall forced to call the help line. It worked good for a couple of weeks and then it lost connection on all of the sources that it was feeding to. I had to call the help line again and it worked for a few days only. I have had it for a month and a half and already own a $40 paper weight. Only get this wifi system if you are good with computers and have a lot a patience. Sorry, have to call up the help line again!"
2,Not good for SIP phone users!!,"D-Link Wireless N Router, 4-Port 10/100 Switch, 2 Antennas, Draft 802.11nI purchased this router as an upgrade to an older one, and while the router setup was very easy and overall it works quite well and is very fast, it does not work with SIP (VoIP) phones!No matter what I did, I was unable to get the router to allow SIP packets to traverse the firewall, and after an hour on the phone with D-Link tech support I was told that the firewall passthrough logic has a defect that is blocking the SIP packets. This was great, but the level 2 tech support person didn't follow up with me to resolve the issue as promised, so I still have no working office telephone.If you need this router just for gaming or normal home/office use, then go for it. If you need anything extra, beware.Good luck!"
3,"not the perfect product, but does its job","like what the title says, it may not be the perfect router out there, but it does its job for me. it has dropped connections probably around 3 times in a span of 3 months, and i just had to reset it. setup was easy and the speed and range is what you would expect it to be. so overall, i'm a happy camper and i am satisfied (not extremely though) with this product."
1,apparently defective,"Could not get it to work, even with a couple hours on the phone with tech support. They seemed to care but we could not get it to work. It was returned."
2,"Good price, poor router","This router has known issues. Every few days you'll have to restart the router. I've had multiple devices that cannot connect to it. iPods, PS3, PC's, Wii. They have the same issue. Every 2-3 days you just have to restart the router. If you're like me & put the router somewhere away from all the traffic in your house this gets to be a pain after about the 20th time you have to do it. I just ended up going back to Linksys and have had no issues. DLink knows about the problem. They had firmware updates that do no fix it."
1,not a good choice,"Right out of the box, started to work then dropped internet connectiontried numerous times, called tech support (I ended up in India, I think) they couldn't resolve it, suggested I let it rest for 2 days and call back again. Yeah, right. Sent it back to Amazon for refund.Amazon took care of it. Thanks"
2,Doesn't work with Polycom VOIP phones,"I was attempting to upgrade from a Linksys WRT54GS (with current firmware) to obtain ""n"" wireless and perhaps better wireless range. I never dreamed I'd be stopped dead in my tracks hooking up my VOIP phone. I opened all ports per the phone manufacturer's instructions, and even put the phone's IP in the DMZ: no joy. Next, I called D-Link customer no-service: the agent was difficult to understand and could offer no assistance to correct the issue. This dog won't hunt so is going back for refund. Too bad, because wireless on this router is excellent."
2,"It was good, when it wasn't disconnected.",Had this router for about 3yrs. Past year or so been disconnecting like crazy. Can't connect to more then a couple devices at once without dropping. The speed is great...just d/c's too much.
2,Junk,"Junk, Trash, Garbage, ETC.It works perfectly fine if you are WIRED to this router. WIRELESS is terrible. I blamed my service provider for several months until I replaced it with a Linksys WRT54GL. Got approximately ~3 mbps on wireless with this as the norm, even when sitting directly in front of the router for tests. After a reset, it will get ~14 - 16 mbps for a limited time until it drops back down to ~3 mbps. The range is also terrible on this router. 1 wall or floor will significantly reduce speeds.Comparatively, my new router gets ~21 mpbs while sitting in front of it. Through 1 wall or floor, the speeds do drop, but not as much as the D-LINK."
2,difficult and confusing,very hard to configure.was on phone with tech support 4 times to fix connection which was on and off.it worked for an hour then went back to multiple connection and speed problems.still waiting for consistent performance.
3,"Okay, but has issues","I've used this router for about a year. It's satisfactory, but I find that I often have to reset it to allow devices to connect wirelessly to it. It seems okay with one device, but when I have another computer, a guest in the house, or my iphone trying to access it, it often doesn't work till I reset it. Once connected, the devices stay connected until they either go to sleep and try to reconnect, or disconnect because they're not in range and try to reconnect again. Sometimes resetting the computer or iphone helps, but not often. It's mostly annoying with my iphone because I don't notice that I'm on the 3G network instead of wireless, and rack up data. I don't have an unlimited plan."
3,Not a good one!,Don't recommend this one for those who will use I pods and I pads! After a while it's not recognizing them and gives them some weired IP Addresses. Very unstable!
3,Constant dropouts with Vonage,"I bought this router to replace my old 802.11b D-Link router. Everything appeared to be working correctly but we began to have constant dropouts with our Vonage phone service. At first I didn't make the connection that it could be the router and assumed I had a technical problem with Vonage or my ISP. After working with both and changing port settings per Vonage recommendations, I continued to have dropouts during every call. Finally, I decided to try the old router on a whim. The dropouts disappeared completely. Next I tried a firmware update which did nothing to solve the problem. Then I tried putting the Vonage ATA on the DMZ - no luck again. Since then, I replaced the router with a Linksys and like my older router, it doesn't cause problems."
1,"Won't work with G4 Powerbook or B wifi adapter, bad customer support","I got a great response from D-Link regarding how to open ports, but when I had to call them directly because my Powerbook G4 1Ghz wouldn't connect to the router (sees it, but won't connect) I got a guy with a thick accent who kept asking remedial questions and offering no good advice. He was finally upgrading my problem to a higher level of support (duh) when he then hung up on me. I will never EVER buy D-link again. Going back to Netgear, or maybe an Airport."
2,Just get a Netgear,"We tried for one week to get this thing to work with our VPN and nothing. We switched settings, speeds. If you won't be using it with a VPN then it was alright. In the end we switched to Netgear. We gave the Dlink one last chance during work only to be disconnected again. Right away we hooked the Netgear router and presto it was good to go. The Dlink router wasn't worth the time and aggravation."
1,Don't buy this router,I bought this router and when I would try to connect to the internet with my lap top I had to unplug it and plug it back in to connect to the internet. I sent 2 emails to D-link and they will not answer me. Don't buy this router it is no good. It is a DIR 615 router.
5,Good router for multiple devices,"I have nothing but great reviews for this router. I paid $80 for this router and is still running strong. I can have 4 laptops, a main computer(all on youtube), online gaming in the living room, and netflix running in two bedrooms with no lag. I highly recommend it"
1,"Dropped packets, no help from tech support; returning to Amazon","We'd suffered under a Linksys router that had to be restarted at least daily, so we were excited to replace it with a newer, more modern router. I'd heard that D-Link was a good brand, but now I can't remember why I bought this when it had so many bad reviews.I've probably spent 12 hours fighting this router now, and I'm finally returning it. It works fine with my windows computers, but with my macs, it blocks various http requests. I tried turning off as many of the router's firewall options as I could, but no luck. So youtube videos don't play, and many internet pages just don't load. I tried calling D-Link tech support, which is apparently in India, but after I was on hold for a long time, the person just took a little bit of my information and then hung up on me.My search for a simple, reliable router continues."
1,Please do not waste your money to buy it,I was using a Dlink wireless B type router that I bought 4 years as refurbished and that gave me great service till now. Now it works fie but give me frequent diconnects once multiple devices connected. So I decided to buy this new router with extra range.I was a big fan of Dlink products but after this router I am not.i: First its signal range was even less than my wireless B router.ii: First it gave me frequent disconnects but after upgrading firmware it was good as far as stable connection.iii: Then the worst happen after 3 months this product died on me and stopeed working tried to reset or work around no success. tried to get tec support help that is difficult too. Plus I do not have too much time for all the long phone callsremoved it put back my old wireless B router worked same as earlier and give sable connection with one computer connectedI will say do not waste your money on this router instead buy some other router this thing is not good at all
4,Works well,I was looking all over the web for a wireless router for my iPod touch and xbox360 this router works great for both also the only reason the tech support is so low is because I never needed it !
1,A scam,I never got the product it was all a scam the price was never true and after all the process they claimed too be out of stock. I feel I was scammed for an offer that never was.
1,"D-Link DIR-615 HORRIBLE, DROPS SIGNALS","1. 21 Nov 08 purchase. Required 1 1/2 hours of D-Link Tech Support just to get the router to work with Time Warmer Cable (San Diego, CA).2. Worked great for five days.3. On the 6th day, over and oer, the router dropped the wireless signal after being online about 2-5 minutes.4. Spent another 1/2 hour online with the D-Link Tech Support help desk, they suggested I return the defective router.5. Day 7 - the router is going back to the store and I will purchase another brand.6. Had a Zyxel X-500 router before. It was incredible. I'll go with that again, or a newer model."
1,I wish I could give it a 0,"I bought this router last September and after multiple resets it totally died on me less than 6 months later. I know some reviews have indicated that the fault may lie with the firmware, not so. I downloaded the latest firmware and the stupid thing still crashed and died. I will never buy a D-Link product again. Bottom line...DO NOT BUY!"
3,Had to use it as a wireless access point,"The router did not work with my Bellsouth Westell DSL modem. Tech support tried but were not much help, only recommendation at the end was to update Firmware. After the software update, still no luck.Then, I found on the internet that it may work as a wireless access point. Turned off DHCP, and turned it into basically a switch or hub. I am using this way and is working fine. Good signal strength and good throughput.So far is working fine (in this mode), but just be aware you may have connection issues depending on your ISP and interfacing equipment."
1,What a disappointment!,"After trying unsuccessfully to use a Lynksis router with Vista, I bought this product without doing any research 5 days ago. What a mistake! After 4 straight days calling customer service (both D-Link and my DSL provider who kept blaming each other) with people who you can not understand, they finally figured out I needed a firmware upgrade. After upgrading, it worked- for about 2 hours before it dropped the connection. Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this at all costs! Customer service was terrible, with 20 minute waits to talk to a person."
3,"Its Average, Drops internet Connection",This is an average product. I got to use this for my Laptop and PS3 online gave play. Normally it works fine but drops link some time especially I am not using it for a day. Next day when I try to connect it shows the in available network but its lost connection with Internet. In that case I need to unplug it and plug it again. They have small reset button but it seems to me just for flashing light.
1,Worst POS I have ever owned,"Tech support is useless. Website is useless. Router constantly loses connection, forgets password, turns off for no reason. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,"Good price, good product, good delivering","The product is excellent and it has a good price, if you compare it with other brands like Linksys or Belkin, this home product can do exactly the same job with a great wireless coverage."
1,Slow in Mixed G and N Mode,"Was easy to install using wizard on CD. Has stand so it can be set vertically. Includes screws for wall mounting.Using D-Link DWA-130 USB adapter, it connected at 150 Mbps in N only mode. Using DWA-130 (N type adapter) in mixed N and G mode, it connected at 54 Mbps.If you run in mixed mode the N devices default to G speeds. Spent an hour on phone with D-Link support to find that out.I wasted my money. I should have just kept my old G Trendnet router.For all I know all N routers default to G speeds with N devices when in mixed mode.Update 06/08/2011: I had 2 of these fail within 1 year's time. I have started using NetGear. I hope they last better."
2,Waste of money,"We have owned this router for about 6 months.Pros:It works 80% of the timeCons:1. Have to reset at least once a week.2. Will not transmit from the bedroom to the basement (our house is small)3. It runs hot.4. Customer service doesn't have clue. Automatic setup didn't work. Contacted customer service, they were no help. I just kept experimenting until it worked.5. I am ready to try a different brand."
1,A NIGHTMARE indeed!,"I use Windows 7 and have my laptop wirelessly hooked up to the router and cable modem. Every half an hour my wireless connection gets lost, I can troubleshoot it using Windows Diagnostics but it is just incredibly annoying to the point where I am considering throwing this piece of junk out. I tried customer support via phone which is time-consuming and did not get me anywhere. I deeply regret purchasing this product and will NEVER buy anything D-Link!!! In fact, my connection was just lost while writing this review, this is a joke. $50 wasted, lots of frustration, just hope the next router will be better."
4,Solid Router,"I recently purchased this D-Link router to replace an aging Linksys router. I was having problems with dropped connections and found myself constantly restarting my Linksys device (WRT54G). I mentioned this to a colleague who suggested that after a few years of usage, the Linksys devices begin to show this behavior. I was reluctant to believe that; however, the investment cost to validate was pretty low.I installed this new D-Link DIR-615. After a bit of tweaking to ensure it had the right configuration, it has been rock solid. No restarts to ensure internet connectivity since I've had it installed. I don't know that this was the fix; however, I am very happy with this device."
1,J Drengacs,"this router is horrible. i have only had it on line for 2 days both of which it has had severe problems. 1st my pc doesn't see it, then when it does after many attempts of resetting the modem and router the pc links up with excellent signal but limited or no connectivity. now dlink wants me to pay to ship back their defective equip so they can replace it. i believe they should send a new 1 with a return shipping label at their expense after all it is a manufacturers defective piece of equip. i am still arguing with their non English speaking tech department. i wouldn't advise buying this product. if i do end up paying to send it back i will not go with another dlink product. i will go back to belkin which by the way i still have their router that hasn't failed in 2 yrs of service. my only reason for this purchase was updating my wireless from g to n with a new pc and router, thank goodness i still have the belkin g."
1,Worst Router Ever!,"Bottom line, did not work and we returned it.Called D-link support 4 times in the first 4 days it was hooked up to the computer. D-link support would get it to work for a short time, signal strength remained between low & good when it was working and the router was only in the next room. Customer support even went so far as to blame it on our cordless phone.Would not buy another D-link."
5,Very good router!,"I have had the router 3 weeks now and if has performed flawlessly. I have had 4 different laptops (Both Vista and XP) connected to it with no problems what so ever. Set up was easy. When looking for a router, I noticed that many were not giving this very good ratings. Kinda of makes one wonder if she or he should bite. One thing that made me try was the deal at the time I bought and I have to wonder about some of the raters evaluations. Sometimes you do have to some with a grain of salt. I am having a good time with it!"
3,Customer Service problems,"I will start by saying that the D-Link router I bought seems to be a good product at a very reasonable price. I had problems setting it up. I called customer service. The people were very difficult to understand. In addition, even though I called back many times, they kept taking me through the same routine every time even though it was obviously not correcting my problem. I finally resolved the problem on my own.The bottom line is that the product is good, but don't count on the instructions or customer service to get it set up."
4,Good Router especially for the price,"This is my third D-Link router. I've stuck to D-Link I think they make a good product,plus I've grown use to configuring the routers.I bought this one after I bought a laptop that I use downstairs,and I use the router upstairs wired to my desktop.As far as connecting to the router from my laptop I have no complaints at all,after about a week of use. Never have I experienced a drop of connection.The router also comes with a stand so you can stand it sideways a feature I appreciate as my desk is a little crowded.The only problem I have is when I test my firewall with Shields up I show about 4 stealth ports,Port 80 open and the rest closed. It may be because I also have Linksys phone adaptor for Voip installed in series with the Router and DSL modem.I'll have to research it but again I suspect the adaptor. All in all I think it's a very good product."
1,PPPoE challenged,"A Router should work ""out of box"" This one didn't! It appears to be related to PPPoE broadband connections which are common for DSL."
2,Needs a firmware update - UPDATED / 4 STARS NOW,"As the other reviews mentioned, the router is easy to setup (with wizards and everything), and I've used D-Link in the past and have had great luck.Problems with this router:1.) Loses internet connection. I'll have to login to the router via the web interface, and reboot the router to get the internet connection back up.2.) The wireless won't always give a DHCP address. I ended up setting my computer to a static address to make sure I'd be able to get on with no problems.I hope D-Link comes out with a fix for it.. soon.UPDATE: D-Link came out with a firmware fix, and it has worked perfectly ever since. It has turned out to be a flawless router. My neighbors love it too!"
1,Loses connection to modem often,"Sadly, my router doesn't work all the time. When it's running correctly and I get a wireless-N connection from my laptop to it, speeds can be in 70-100 Mbps range, I'm very pleased. Unfortunately, it often loses it's IP address. It's relatively easy for me to correct if I'm wired to it, but it's annoying to have to use a wireless router mostly in wired mode. I may replace it if I there isn't a firmware solution soon."
1,SIGNAL DROPOUTS 4 TO 5 TIMES A DAY! BAD BUY,DIR-615 DLINK WIRELESS N ROUTER a bad buy!!!! wifi signal dropouts super frequent! from the 1st day itself it was 3 to 4 times a day! a complete hassle as the wifi signal returns only after switching off the router and then switching it on again! A grave problem when carrying out online transactions if the signal drops out. Be well warned before u invest in it and my seller triple net pricing situated in brooklyn new york made me pay 15 dollars return shipping for this 38 dollar item cause they said the product is not defective its just simply INCOMPATIBLE !!!!! nonsense
2,Was great when it worked.,I bought this for my sister-in law. My nephew threw the CD and packaging away after I set it up. It worked fine for a few weeks and now it doesn't work anymore.
4,"Good router,very fast and reliable.","when i got this router it was a top rated model,I now have a new netgear wndr4500 new,and gave this to my mother in law who uses it without issue,easy to hook up and is fast and secure.# generations of routers and its still doing a fine job."
1,please don't waste your time or money,"I am on my third replacement of my D-link DIR-615. The unit kept losing the wireless signal and I would call D link for help and they would put me on hold ,forever. Finally ,when I would get to talk to someone .It would be , a person that I could not hardly understand, yes everytime. I have a case number of case numbers. The tech support was awfull. I am sorry for having to give this type of a report for D- link. Becuase I have an older D link wireless router ,that I have had zero problems with. I wanted to upgrade to a N router , for a better signal. The swicth has been a terrible headache . I feel sorry for the seller, which has been very helpful. I have a total of six D-link devices in my home and have had no problem until this purchase. Please stay away from the DIR-615 D link router."
2,"Good, but don't have detachable antennas...","It's great, but don't have detachable antennas... The description as wrong with this however the router works great and is for a little house"
2,Had to restart it every couple of days,"My connected devices would just slow to a crawl, until I rebooted this thing... ever couple of days. Got a Linksys and I'm much happier now."
5,d-link router,"d-link router works fine, just be sure to follow cd instructions well. would recommend for any home use. or small area ."
3,Good stuff,Item is purchased for my in laws. I installed in their home last year and it hasn't had any issues.
2,craptacular,"The router and Ethernet switch functionality is fine, but the wireless is absolutely godawful.From the get-go the DHCP server has been very finicky about giving out IP addresses to wireless devices. Sometimes my laptop and my PS3 can get on the network just fine, other times I have to reset the router.The signal strength has been so-so, although recently it seems to have degraded significantly. My PS3 is about 15 feet away from the router, and until a couple of days ago I could get decent throughput over wireless.However, now it's to the point where I have to connect my PS3 to the router via Ethernet, as the wireless is practically unusable. Just pinging the router from my laptop at the same distance as the PS3 shows a 27% packet drop rate - unbelievable.Needless to say, I'm buying another router, and it's not going to be a D-Link."
4,Good in use but little tough to setup,I took this item recently. So far it's working nice. But it's little tough to setup. But usage side it's pretty good.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This router offers a very good range, however it is completely unreliable. I began having problems with it failing within the first week, but it happened rather infrequently. I have now owned the D Link for almost six months and at this point I'm forced to reset it (disconnect and reconnect to powers source) at least every couple of days; sometimes multiple times in the same day. I should have known better since I had similar issues with another D Link router, but learn from my mistake and go with another brand."
4,D-Link DIR 615,"My DIR-615(N) is only 4 days old and is working just fine with no drop-outs. (Currently using WPA.)It's on 24/7 and has been running cool to the touch. ((My ISP is Comcast (with TV, telephone, and internet). The modem is an RCA Thomson DHG536.))Using the provided cd setup was super easy for the desktop. Had a problem when I tried to setup my netbook for wireless but it turned out to be operator - my error. D-Link tech support for the netbook problem was there after the third ring and information exchange was good although at times I had to request he speak slower and more clearly (off-shore??).MaximumPC (Feb 2010) has this DIR-615 rated a ""9"" which is why I bought it."
4,just waht i was looking for,"I'm enjoying my router, it's easy to set up, even If you are not comoputer savvy, a A in my book"
1,Poor quality,"Randomly stops broadcasting the wireless signal several times a day, requiring a reboot. This is a widespread, verified problem. Tech support is useless. Back it goes!"
2,D-Link fails at something easy,"I have had this router for over 9 months with constant use using it with mixed hardware. Currently I have a wireless desktop, 2 iphones, ipod touch and 2 laptops one being G and one N. The step down to G is not an issue for me and rarely do we have all the hardware connected at once. For the last month the router stops connecting for about 2 minutes a few times a day. I have checked for firmware updates and other users with the same issue with no ability to correct it. Prior to D-Link I have always used Linksys with no issues, I should have listen to associates and reviews and went with a different router."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This is only my second router having upgraded from a Microsoft. This router has given me headaches for about two months. It was a pain to setup but after updating the firmware worked fine wired. Wireless was another issue entirely. Wireless was spotty at best with repeated dropped signal. Finally, after months of frustration, the thing died. I'm glad to be rid of it and can't wait to find something that works. I will never, as long as I live, buy another Dlink product!!"
4,Connection was hard but...,Connecting my laptops and ps3's to the router was a lil hard at first ( they didn't want to link for nothing in this world) but I firgured it out and now the router works amazing. I love. The signal strenght is good the range is pretty good. Everything is great. Like I said the only bad part was that first time linking them.
4,Great Buys,"Well as someone who knows nothing about routers I decided to upgrade to DSL from Dial-up. I started the dreaded journey of bargain shopping, comparing prices, seeing which item is better for less money, etc. Well I'm glad I bought this one because it does the job perfectly and I use it just about everyday. It was easy to install, it took less than 2 minutes and was the easiest thing to do in comparison to installing the DSL internet service. I absolutely love it."
4,Reliable and Fast,This has been very reliable as compared to the 4 year old netgear I had. The signal strength and speed is excellant for the machines I have.
1,unable to get to work,since unable to get product to work; unable to further give accuratereview on how the product performed
2,Worst router ever,"I've used routers for about 8 years. I've always liked D-link the best, but this is the worst router I've ever had. I cannot connect my lexmark wireless printer. The signal is terrible! I only get signal in my livingroom. I do not have a big house, and I only need to get signal in my livingroom, kitchen, sunroom, and on the deck. I already discarded the packaging, but I will try to send it back.I have a HP Touchsmart computer and the rounter drops the signal all the time. My computer is 6 ft away from the router. I constantly have to reset the router.Get the more expensive ones with a stronger signal."
1,Not good at all,"If you want to reset your router avery time you start your computer, this is the perfect. Before I bought it, I read some reviews and did not put atention to this and is real. Don not spend your money on D-Link routers at all."
4,Good Product for Value,Good product and good value. Setup software was easy and tech support is available.
1,worst reliability experienced,Went through two of these routers in 14 months. Now out of warranty and out of luck. Don't buy this product if you want a reliable router!

5,Biography of a Great American,"I read this book for free on archive.org and in the Library of Congress Library.This book is history itself as it was written over 100 years ago. So touched by the storiesof this great man that I saved some of the quotes.If you like history and biographical material, this is a book to read."
5,Great Album from Ween,"Just got the new album. Have listened to it a few times so far. It could be my favorite Ween album. I am a huge fan of all their previous albums with The Mollusk and Pure Quava being my favorites. This album seems like an obvious transition for the boys from New Hope. More pop influenced tunes with just enough of the weirdness that is undeniably ween. Again borrowing from all walks of music, carribean, pop, steely dan, prince, punk. They seem find an unexhaustible base of music to borrow from and improve upon. Great album for fans as well as a great album for those who have never heard their music before. *****"
3,"It promised so much, but deliveres so little!","I can understand that perhaps musically Gene and Dean want to spread their musical wings and create something a little more weighty and ambitious than their previous albums (all of which I love). The production is certainly nice on this record, but to me they've somehow lost the sense of fun, quirkyness, humour and spontaneity that attracted me to their sound in the first place. Ween are obviously trying to get a little more commercial with this release. Sadly at times I'd go as far to say that White Pepper can sound pretentious and contrived. If you're new to Ween, then I'd recomend Chocolate and Cheese, and if you're not you'd proably agree."
3,Rock's most ecclectic band plays it safe,"Yes, this is Ween's most relaxed, non-challenging album. That alone does not make it poor. White Pepper begins with one of modern rocks more satisfying introductions, and when the guitar production enters the foreground as the first verse begins, one of Ween's most transcendent moments occur. The duo, who are usually preoccupied with their habitual schizophrenic zaniness to the point of near-gimmickry, actually etch out a few irony-free songs before declining into the mediocrity-fest much of it seems to be. While there are certainly a few gems on this album, this safeness, this antithesis of what Ween are so good at providing eventually becomes more apparent as the latter half begins folding in on itself in a generic haze."
2,dumbfounded,"Been a fan of the band for about 8 years now. I'm not married to their old style; thought the Mollusk was one of their best albums. It's just this album is as flat as a pancake to me. The jams seemed uninspired and brain dead, the lyrics were a wash, and so on. This is the only Ween album I dislike. So I'm dumbfounded, cause every review I see on here so far is from people who loved it. Hm."
2,Bland Weenso,"This album disappointed me. I found none of the tracks to be outstanding, and only a few to be worth listening to more than a couple times. This is the brothers Ween's soft rockin' 70's album. The most exciting it gets is when they start sounding like Pink Floyd. And I don't even like Pink Floyd. I expect Ween to be abrasive, obnoxious, and offensive, but not dull."
5,great!,"This is just one of the many great Ween albums. There's only twelve songs on it, but each one is really different from the other and a great listen. My personal favorites on this album are ""she's your baby"" and ""back to basom"". Highly reccomended to any Ween fan."
4,A Review Haiku by Todd Marrone,"One more testamentto the band's tremendous range,the first three tracks shine."
2,"Great album, but a poor product from Amazon","This is a great ween album. Personally, it's my favorite. ""Even if you Don't"", ""Stay Forever"" and ""She's Your Baby"" are some of the best written songs in their catalog. It would not be a stretch for me to say I hear a lot of Beatles in this album. The problem I have with my purchase is that the vinyl record I ordered from amazon was warped. Not even a little bit like some albums, it is truly warped like it was left is some hot warehouse for years. I immediately regretted purchasing this one, but not because of the music. Take it from me and buy this one on cd."
4,The first Ween CD I would actually reccomend...,"I've been a fan of Ween since ""The Pod"", and I have all of thier releases. ""White Pepper"" sort of surprised me because... it's actually a good record! Ween, for me, has been a band that was easier to admire than actually listen to. Here is a Ween disc that you can actually rock out to! There are some seriously beautiful moments on this CD. It reveals the Brothers Ween as really gifted composers, despite all of thier earlier hi-jinks. Although, this might not surprise long-time followers. There has always been a weird sort of intelligence to what Ween has done. I think this is CD that will be criminally underated, but it is disc just about anyone with ears would enjoy, even if you knew nothing about the band."
3,Ween invades the '80s,"This album marks the further exploits of Ween in their attempts to conquer all musical genres. They systematically show that they can do all of that stuff at least as well if not better than the original 80's bands. On this disc I hear Genesis, Van Halen, Prince (of course), and Jimmy Buffet (Ween's take on the Margaritaville theme). The one problem I have is that I never really liked the music from the 80's very much, so I don't listen to this one as much as many of the others - hence the 3 stars. Like the country album, though, it is much more valuable when considered as part of the whole Ween odyssey. Gene and Dean are giggling in the background as you listen to this, even though it is less explicitly humorous than their others. I guess by now they trust that we all understand what they are doing. I hope they keep evolving and trying out new styles."
4,What a great album!,"This album rocks! I had heard Ween, but never an entire album of their work. This album was a great introduction to their unique music, their music being extremely catchy, clever, odd pop/rock songs. I absolutely love this album."
5,So good it hurts.,"This album has an enormous range. Hard rock, rem like ballads, beatlesque pop. My favorites on this album are: The Grobe, Even if You Don't, and Stay Forever. If you are new to Ween this is a good place to start, if you like their other stuff, this is another winner. Hard to say what makes their music so good, just know it is."
4,A distinct indication of - (sit down for this) - maturity,"Even though we get the expected genre-hopping, albeit with a slightly lesser dependence than usual on sophomoric humour, ""White Pepper"" may be the first recording on which Ween sound like an actual band rather than irony-clad parodists. Their previously downplayed gift for melody takes centerstage, and the results are often breathtaking. ""Flutes of Chi"" sounds like George Harrison at his most tuneful backed by an army of Hare Krishnas. ""Exactly Where I'm At"" may be the most sublime moment in Ween's career thus far. And ""Even If You Don't"" is bouncy pop with a sly lyric reversal that John Lennon would've been proud to author. The only bum note would be the Jimmy Buffet soundalike ""Bananas and Blow"", which hits its target a little too perfectly (meaning Buffet fans will love it). Ween continue to chart their own path, and ""White Pepper"" is just more evidence that its worth following them to whatever glorious weirdness awaits."
5,So White It's Brown,"The Ween bros have quite a back catalog and much of it is probably too eclectic for mainstream music listeners. Many of their hardcore fans like it that way. But they also have a few ""easier"" to listen to"" albums, with White Pepper and The Mollusk as the standouts. They still have their tongue in cheek lyrics but the music is more power pop than garage experimental grunge. Here they are channeling their inner Beatles to great effect. Not every track is a winner, but on the whole, this is my favorite ""mainstream"" offering from them.I'm not sure what the Ogv (Ogg Vorbis?) stands for in the re-release, but White Pepper is a highlight of their career. Fans of their early years may be disappointed, but the rest of us will find much to enjoy."
4,Mellow Ween,White Pepper is Ween's most mellow album. I could plop this CD in and take a relaxing nap. Bananas and Blow takes me a Hawaiian luau. Stroker Ace is the only song with some pace. Lyrics of the album are still Ween-like. Going to see these guys in concert later in the month. My hope is that they only play a few off this one otherwise it may be a yawner. A descent CD but was expecting so much more.
5,Another Great One,"Another great one from the boys. Definately a unique sound, though... Every Ween album has a unique sound, of course, but they all have a common ""Ween"" thread running through them... this definately is a departure, and it does take some listening to get used to... but, once you get into it, you'll see that there are a couple real gems here, like Flutes of the Chi, Even If You Don't, and Back to Basom... Enjoy!"
5,pictures that remain with you long after childhood,"On one page is a picture of a tree with its own fairy, on the opposite side an accompanying verse. I LOVE the pine tree fairy, his hat made out of a cone; and the lilac fairy sniffing the blossom."
3,Flower Fairies of the Trees,This is lovely book; my grandaughter is named Willow so the tree fairies are very special to us.
5,The Good Stuff,"If you are into Indian and/or middle-eastern music woven with modern dub/electronica, then this one is for you.I found myself hearing the songs over and over, not just in my head, but resonating in my being! The songs repeat certain themes throughout to provide a haunting continuity. Certain melodies and vocal parts just tend to stay with me. It is very addictive.It is highly recommended that you listen to this on a really good system, preferably one with a sub-woofer.Deep reverberating cellos, tablas, doumbeks, ambient vocals.Whether its trance, or dance this release is definitely worth checking out!"
2,For a side of Europe that's a lot like a frat house,"If you want to go to Europe and drink this is the book for you. If you want to go to Europe to ""fraternize"" this is the book for you too. If you're going to Europe with other things in mind, I'd find another book."
3,From the bowels of Hell...,This is a great sculpt of an underused character. It's too bad that the anatomy of his feet and the weight of his barely-bendable tail make it difficult for him to stand.
2,Not as good as other T3s,"I was disappointed with this model. I used my friend's wet TO dry and it was fantastic. I ordered the wet OR dry because of the decrease in price from $200 to $129. But I should have known better (there's a reason for the decrease in price) It does not work as well as the wet to dry - at all. It snagged my hair and didn't eliminate frizz - Any $20 flat iron would work just the same. However, I did exchange it for the medium Duality model and the difference is amazing. Much better!!"
2,Could've been great,"However, after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on. Straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at Sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from Amazon. It is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay. So if you have had good luck with one so far, be glad because I paid for the 2 day shipping couldn't wait, and have GREAT disappointment because now I have to return it!"
1,Useless product,"I am about to return my third wet/dry iron! First one didn't work to start with. Second worked for a couple of months and got less hot as time went on - also kept turning itself off until it spent more time off than on. I got a third one a couple of days ago and during the first use last night - surprise - it stopped after 5 minutes and does not work at all now!It's going back for good to Sephora (thanks to them for being so helpful) I'm changing brands. I only used it on dry hair too - the one time I used it on wet hair, it steamed a lot and promptly turned itself off! $200 does not buy reliability even if it was good on the infrequent times it did work.I do have the T3 hairdrier - that at least seems to be problem free."
1,Not worth the money,"I have nothing positive to say about this iron. 1. My hair got caught a few times between the plates. 2. My hair isn't that wavy, should be easy to straighten, however it took me about half an hour with dry hair to get it a bit straight @ 250 degrees. I tried my friend's CHI and it did a much better job."
1,Crap,"I purchased this iron a few years ago because I had heard great things. I'm black with relaxer, but I don't relax my hair bone-straight (it's more texlaxed). So when my hair is wet, it's still curly.I am afraid to use it on wet hair, but I have used it on dry hair. And it did nothing but literally FLATTEN my curl. It was still wavy, but just flat. I looked like Flat Stanley's long lost black sister.I ended up giving this iron away to my sister and sticking with my Chi Turbo."
3,"Find the 2 disc import, you'll like it better.","I give this review 3 stars because the original 2 lp, and extened length cassette has a total of 3 extra live songs. You may still buy the cassette, if you look hard enuff.This is a great document of a great live band. The songs are top notch '80s pop metal songs. This is also the BEST lineup this band has had, although Don and Mr. Scary never really saw eye to eye they made some great music.The 2 cd set contains the following extra songs: Standing In The Shadows, Sleepless Night, & Turn on the Action.Look hard for the two cd version, you will like it alot more. I do."
5,Essential LIVE Dokken Release Japanese release that is,"First off this is a great live release from Dokken playing live in Tokyo, Japan. this is a review of the 2 disc Japanese edition it has 17 songs they are1.Unchain the night2.Tooth and Nail3.Standing in the Shadows* NOT ON US RELEASE4.Sleepless Nights* NOT ON US RELEASE5.Dream Warriors6.Kiss Of Death7.When Heaven Comes Down8.Into The Fire9.Mr. Scary END DISC 1DISC 21.Heaven Sent2.It's Not Love3.Alone Again4.Just Got Lucky5.Breaking The Chains6.In My Dreams7.Turn On The Action* NOT ON US RELEASE8.Walk Away (studio track)The 2 disc version runs around 90 minutes or so maybe longer or shorter can't remember but its longer then the US one at 70 odd minutes long. This is the whole show and in order it also shows Dokken in their prime buy this and under lock and key and tooth and nail and MAYBE back for the attack as well. 5 stars is not enough I give it 10"
5,You Haven't Heard Dokken Rock Until You've Heard 'Em Live,"None of Dokken's studio albums can compare to the searing burst of heavy-metal power that this live album puts out. On this CD you'll hear the boys rock like never before. The studio albums they've made sound tame compared to the way they sound live on this CD. It's Dokken unchained, pure and simple. In addition, the amount of music included on the album is very generous (71 min.!) And the selected songs are great! In fact, I'd even recommend this album over ""The Best of Dokken"" for a mix of their best music. A MUST HAVE for every fan of Dokken and heavy metal in general!"
4,Dokken - 'Beast From The East' (Elektra) 2-CD,"Released in 1988, I seem to recall seeing the band twice that year, once opening for Aerosmith and later in the summer on tour with the 'Monsters Of Rock' trek with Van Halen, Scorpions, Metallica and Kingdom Come. Anyone else remember that? Wish they'd have shindigs like that these days. I've always liked hearing Dokken, even in the more recent times here. 'Beast In The East' is a good live 2-CD effort. Total of seventeen tracks with a duration of 88 minutes. Tunes I loved experiencing time and time again were ""Unchain The Night"", ""Dream Warriors"", ""Kiss Of Death"", ""Breaking The Chains"" and ""In My Dreams"" (great harmony vocals). Recommended if you like '80's metal."
3,Just ok...from a Dokken and Lynch fan!,"I am a big Dokken fan and a huge George Lynch fan in general...that said, there is not much to say about this release other than it is basically the studio versions done on stage for the most part...sounds fine, just not very inspirational, special or different from the studio albums. I love the Dokken albums w Lynch, but there is just nothing here really that makes you say ""wow"" at all....that's it!"
4,One of the best live rock releases of all.,"This is a very good live release. If you are looking for a Dokken CD, this one is to add to the collection. The entire band sounds great live and the crowd is really into them."
2,Pricey,"I bought this online because it was much cheaper than in my local health-food store. Then I got slapped with a $7 shipping charge! For a teeny envelope of product! I'll buy from the store, thanks."
2,"Good price, questionable shipping","Was very happy to find this at such a resonable price and I am sure it will a very good product. The unfortunate part is they seem to charge shipping according to the price of an item, not the weight. By the time you add up shipping and price of the xanthan gum you will pay the same anywhere. Not a savings!"
1,Un-edited stories,"Please don't be fooled into buying this book. Even a cursory glance will tell you that the stories included in this anthology are not, in their present state, ready to be published. There is zero evidence to suggest that any editing has taken place, however loose one's definition of the word. I feel sorry for all the people who have submitted stories. What these authors need - what every aspiring writer needs - is constructive criticism, in order to improve. These writers' works should not be in print without serious revision. Ironically, the ""editor""'s short story is the worst of the lot."
1,I can't believe I put out good money for this mess,"There was only a single half-way decent story in the book, the one by Steven Shrewsbury. I have read many of his stories and liked them, but this one, Home of the Brave, disappointed me.The others were trite, poorly written and unappetizing. The worst of the lot was Pacione's Bite of the Spider, which is a sequel to his House of Spiders. He cannot write well to begin with. His sentences change tense in the middle, his analogies don't work, and I sometimes wonder if he knows the proper meaning of many of the words he uses. His story is a perfect example of what is known as the ""dumbing down of America"".Hasan Abood's story, El Horror de la realidad, is the second worst in the book. The dialog is stiff and unworkable. His simplistic sentence structure read like a fourth grader wrote them. I found the story to be completely trite.The rest of the stories in this anthology are not worth mentioning."
3,Who's Who and Where's Where in the Bible,"This is a good study and information book for Bible study, I was just looking for more in depth study guide."
1,Batteries are dead,I ordered this product from amazon.com and when it arrived I fully charged the batteries. When I went to use them they were dead. I charged them again and when I went to use them a few days later the batteries were dead again! I want my money back!
1,very nice but it was broken,I got this charger through a third party seller and IT DOES NOT WORK and I could not get my money back... TOO BAD ADORAMA..I had bought this item before directly from amazon but this time I had no luck... they would not give me my money back and the charger won't work.
3,"Like listening to a lecture, but on paper...","I loved the hobbit and lotr, so when i saw the silmarillion i just had to get it. however, after reading it through about halfway, i almost put it down. i know that christopher tolkien is just trying to clear up his fathers works, but it is almost like reading a lecture. he just drones on and on and on about trivial facts that no one but a historian would really care about. He also adds in 2-3 variations of some stories, making it twice as confusing. i was also disappointed in the style that tolkien wrote this book in. you dont really get to know any of the characters the way you did in his previous works. they always seem distant, and you dont really care if they live or die. only get this one if you feel like digesting a huge amount of similar material at the same time."
2,Confusing,"Although I have to give credit to Tolkein for all of the details and intricacies of this book, I found it confusing. I reccommend having a notepad alongside you while reading. That way you can write down all of the names and keep track. I am a lover of the hobbit, lord of the rings, and many other of his books but this one was just plain confusing and therefore I did not enjoy it at all."
2,Definitely a niche text.,"Unless you are already an avid ""Lord of The Rings"" (LoTR) fan this is one to avoid. I read ""The Silmarillion"" after completing LoTR, about which I was only mildly enthusiastic. It was a struggle not to abandon it and move on to something more engaging. ""The Silmarillion"" reads like an ancient historical text, but one can't help but be aware that the ""history"" being portrayed exists entirely within Tolkien's head. The lack of significance makes sloughing through the dense and often pretentious prose a chore with little reward.LotR is an important piece of modern cultural mythology. It falls under the category of something one should read. It helps that it has an interesting story line and vivid characters. The same can no be said for ""The Silmarillion."" All but hardcore Tolkien aficionados can safely leave this one by the wayside."
3,boring,this book was totally the most boring one i have ever read in my entire. not worth any of my money
5,book purchase,"The price was right, the book was received in perfect condition and sooner than expected. I would recommend this seller to others without hesitation!"
2,THE SILMARILLION-JUST TOO EPIC!,"Anyone who loves the Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings as much I do is left wanting more. So naturally ""The Silmarillion"" is the next obvious choice. Sadly this grandiose work falls short of J.R.R 's earlier work.One could say that this was his son's influence on the text but sadly I think that both father and son had lost sight of the true magic of Middle-Earth. Namely great story telling.Yes with in depth history to back up the myth but not at the expense of the narrative. Still there are some great insights. Not enough though to sustain what is essentially a history (of biblical proportions) of Middle Earth and Numenor and lands beyond from the dawn of creation. I love escaping into fantasy but not to this degree. I even found the sheer wealth of detail a little unnerving.Good Luck!!!"
2,well written but sadly dull,"Yes as every other reviewer has pointed out this book is well written, but where i disagree is in the fact that the book will put you to sleep. Some parts will grasp you and not let go but then again not only are those parts short and far between but ultimately unfulfilling, each story is never fully realized and is to short in my opinion. If you would like to read a creation story go read the first five books of the bible, it's what you feel like you have just read anyways. A long list of who married who and their children and their childrens children, where their step neice lived etc... if you are a tolkien junky who needs his fix be ready because this IS NOT lotr, its completely different. Tolkien must be given credit though this book is well written. If you just have to read it buy it used or get it from a friend, its not worth buying."
3,Good luck,"I am a major fan of Tolkien, and I love the Lord of the Rings.That said, if you can make it through this book, you deserve extra Hobbit points. It's basically the Bible of Middle Earth. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just a major struggle to get through. If you aren't a super-die-hard fan of Tolkien, stay away from The Silmarillion."
3,Cellar Of Horror,"This is a true crime book that descibes in agonozing details the story of a psychotic who chained women in his basement. if you like true crime, then this is for you. The book is graphic so be warned."
5,Woooshhhh!!,...Woooshhhh what a band!! What a performance!! Even some songs that I did not know (from MEtalhead) made me enthusiasthic!!!!!KILLING GROUND is their best album since their return to form begun in 1997's UNLEASH THE BEAST.But watching them live is a wonderful experience!
5,BEST WORK SINCE POWER AND THE GLORY,"Killing Ground is Saxon's finest album to date with the kind of riffery that will satisfy your metal appetite. Mr. Byford & Co. really dug deep this time and came up with an impressive intro along with 10 meaty slabs that you can sink your teeth into. That and the 8 classics that they revamped kick serious (...). Tracks Killing Ground and Deeds of Glory are sure to give you a lead foot when you crank'em in your car stereo, while anthems Coming Home, Hell Freezes Over, and Rock is our Life set fire to your speakers.To sum up, Killing Ground is an intelligently constructed album that you can listen to over and over with the likes of Power and the Glory, Wheels of Steel, and Strong Arm of the Law. An outstanding masterpiece. Strap it on..."
5,Sony D-NS921F,"This is the first time that I have bought myself a CD walkman. Being from Sony, this player lives up to its name and the sound quality is amazing. My main considerations before buying this player was that it plays MP3s too. Surprisingly though they do not mention the fact that this unit can also be used as a recharger unit for the NiMH batteries (Batteries are not supplied with the unit though). An AC adapter is also supplied although the sonystyle website does not indicate that. The radio part (AM/FM/TV/Weather band) all works great. The unit is great to handle and the design is pretty ergonomic. I just tried out some sample ATRAC tracks on a CD-RW disc and the quality is decent. All in all this unit rocks! I'd definitely recommend it."
4,Nice indulgance for the active person,"This is an excellent mp3 walkman. There are three main pros to buying this walkman1) Skip protection2) Long Battery life3) DurabilityI can run, play basketball, and not miss a single beat. It's quite amazing. Equally impressive is the 60+ minutes of play time on two AA (rechargeable) batteries. The sound quality is excellent, but this should not be the main reason to buy this walkman. If you're an active person and want to listen to your CDs,mp3s,and radio, get this walkman ASAP. It's slightly pricey, but you will not regret it!The main con of this walkman is the lack of an external control. Skipping to the exact song you want can be a slight pain if the walkman is inside a hip pack. It's not a big deal because the control knob is easy to find and to operate. I would definitely not give up any of the skip protection or battery life to get this feature."
4,Amazing technology on CD,"If you need a portable CD player with added flexibility this is the one. Can take it to the beach without any worries. Comes with a hand -grip so you can hold it wall running/walking, with awesome thumstick control system. Also, with Atrac3 you can store all the music you will ever need on to 1 CD. The only frustration is not being able to use the CD's on other systems."
4,good product just few small issues,This is a pretty rugged cd player but the only things i thought the could have made better was the control for the knob on the top and work on the dot matrix screen to not disappear at times while playing a cd
2,Bummer,"If you can't hear this thing 'chirping', you should get your hearing checked. I am seriously surprised Sony shipped this product."
2,It really isn't very good!,"I just had to comment on this DVD. I waited for this DVD for about 2 1/2 years. I even purchased a DVD player the day I heard this was in production, so I wouldn't be without one when it came out. Well, the day came and I was crushed! The videos I'd seen before, and they are what they are. Entertaining, goofy, lovable. BUT, the documentary! It's terrible. The editing is terrible. There was little to no narration, very little new information. The art direction was non-existent. There was no definable visual threads through the whole film. It seemed poorly planned and organized. The live footage was pretty good, but there wasn't enough footage from after Crooked Rain, but before Terror Twilight."
3,finally,"The videos are great, and the concert footage is very good. I would've preferred that one of the shows be from a something other than the Terror Twilight tour though.The documentary, the part I was most anxious to see, was a bit disappointing. It started out good, I enjoyed hearing more about how Pavement formed, particulary the problems they had with Gary Young and the release of Slanted & Enchanted. But the rest of it used too much random concert footage as filler, and strayed away from interesting topics. Maybe I'm just too used to watching VH1 Behind the Music or something.Anyway, this is still a must for any serious Pavement fan."
4,just about all you want,good history/nostalgia coverage. very professional and dreamy artwork all over the place. two shows. videos. perhaps we can call this the *eek* Your quintessential Pavement bookend.
2,Not too good....,"I love Pavement, but those guys are slackers. Case in point -- this DVD, a half-assed collection of stuff that got thrown together at an extremely leisurely pace. The videos, most of which I'd never had a chance to see, are kind of interesting once. The commentary is, for the most part, pretty silly and doesn't yield a whole lotta deep insight.Overall, this is a good rental, but I'd save the big bucks and spend 'em on the reissued ""Slanted and Enchanted"" disk."
2,I am so torn over this movie...,"I love Pavement. They are absolutely one of my favorite bands. This DVD, though, is just simply awful. The videos are good to have, and for that I'm grateful. But the documentary is so boring and shot so poorly. The live concert sound is terrible and doesn't do Pavement justice at all.I'm also not a big fan of back-in-the-day documentaries, I guess. I like seeing things as they unfold, not watch people reminisce about the past. This band, more than any other, deserves better.Rate this FIVE stars for Pavement. MINUS ONE star for the documentary. Hence, two stars."
3,Cautiously Recommend,"Product is of great quallity and looks! However, its metal frame scratched its outline in my clear coat. so i removed the frame! I have a Lexus IS 250 so I don't recommend this frame if it will mount on your car the same way as the Lexus. If you are mounting to a bumper or if you don't care about it scratching your paint or clear coat, then I would recommend the product."
2,Not well done.,"He was a great sub commander but not a great writer. Very poor sentence structure, hard to follow his ideas. Poorly printed, bad typeface. I thought I was going to go blind! Thunder Below about the USS Barb is much better in every way."
2,ho hum,"Submarine warfare is alot of dull moments with a few thrills and then back to dull and this book captures every bit of it. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but it is just so repeditive. I found myself looking at my percentage read marker hoping I was way beyond what I really was, by the time I got to 62% I just didnt care any more, the captain obviously made it through the war because he wrote the book and I found that, that was good enough for me !"
4,felt like I was there!,"I didn't find this book dull in any way. I felt like I was experiencing the action right there with the crew. Most who have an interest in this type of book, appreciate, I believe, the details in order to get the feel of ""being there"". There is another ""must read"" that I highly recommend: War Beneath the Waves by Don Keith. What an exciting story and unbelievable. Helen Potter"
4,Clear the Bridge,"If Hollywood is looking for a new action-adventure subject, they need look no further than the war patrols of the USS Tang. Join Richard O'Kane aboard the Tang as he weaves a tale of suspense and action better than any work of fiction. Under his command, the Tang ranked fourth in the number of tons of Japanese shipping sunk. We get a rare ""periscope liberty"" look over the author's shoulder as he tracks his prey across the vast Pacific. Whether rescuing a record number of downed fliers or launching torpedoes from the very center of a confused and sinking Japanese convoy, his no-nonsense style and matter-of-fact delivery leave no doubt that this man was - in every respect - a true submarine commander. This book provides one of the truly great depictions of the kind of heroes who served in World War II, especially those in the ""Silent Service."""
3,SUBMARINE IN THE PACIFICWAR,"This book should be mandatory reading for submarine officers. It shows in fulll details how to run a sub in wartimeand the responsabilities of the captain. The author, Richard O'Kane left nothing out, but as a result , it reads like a log, or rather a series of logs. The action is great, when there is action, but the periods in between, the waiting for the enemy to show up, become quite boring. I did not put the book down, because I wanted the rest of the action. If O'Kane had left out one quarter of the book, it would have become a lot more readable and also more exciting."
5,BILL MCCORVEY -Pirates of the miss,Bill Mccorvey is a talented song writer incrdible singer and most passionate guitar player every song on each of the pirates cds are all very good he is not just that guy who sang feed jake please get to know him as a country/rock fan you need to know his music i wish he would come back with a solo cd i have hurd he has a new band the bill mccorvey band i have seen him with the pirates 163 times he is that good! cant wate to hear from him again 'ting'christina warren sweetauburn@webtv.net and @aol.com
4,When the Beauty's Gone,"If you can find it, buy the When the Beauty's Gone EP first. It has the original (and better) versions of the best 5 songs on this disc. Then get this one and the updates to those songs are an interesting change, and the rest of the tracks are pretty good too. I'm giving it 4 stars because I expected more after that 5 star EP. Hopefully the album they're working on now will be all that I expect from them.B."
4,Good product,"The plugs fit great and are well made but there are a few problems.1. The price - You can get stainless steel plugs for cheaper than this. Personally, after buying these and another set of Industrial Strength plugs, I would try to buy from them in the future but those on a budget can find a better deal elsewhere.2. The O-rings - Its a minor point but in the picture shown they are black but mine are clear. Just a point for the discerning buyer. I did't really care though."
2,Not happy,I received the pendant today. Was not happy with what I got at all. The one in the picture shows markings around the circle. The one sent was just plain..... This is a present for my daughter am so glad it came here first and not to her.
5,It's life changing,"I first received this neclace as a present on my third day in NA, which also happened to be my birthday. This neclace helped keep my clean for my first 30 days buy reminding me that there are people in the NA family who do care about me. Now I have gotten one for my sponsor as a thank you gift and I am sure she will love it as much as I do. If you or someone you know is in NA and working hard to stay clean and sober, I recommend getting this neclace. It means so much more than you will ever know without it."
4,fun game,"We had a lot of fun playing this over the Christmas weekend. It's a ton of fun if your kid loves I spy. However, I don't know if it will be a game that can be played over and over because eventually you will remember where items are. But I think it's worth the price."
3,Could be better,"I love I Spy products and so do my 5 and 7 yr old boys. This game is fun but could be better. There are 4 double-sided boards for players, they are not equal in complexity which is a minus. Also there just aren't enough cards. There could have been double the cards so that kids wouldn't run into the same pictures over and over again and know where they are by memory. It's annoying that the makers ""cheaped out"" this way when it could've enhanced the game a lot had they just included more cards. The bell is nice since it's not electronic so no annoying batteries, just a ding ding bell. Kids still love it and would probably rate it higher than I did."
4,I Spy Fun,The matching isn't too easy or too hard for children I have been playing this game with children ages 4-6. The game keeps their attention. It's a good twist on memory games. The pictures are fun to look at even for adults. I have enjoyed playing this game with the children I work with.
3,"Fun, but probably for 3 to 5 age group","I got this for my 5 year old niece and played it with her and her 10 year old brother. Each 'round' where we drew a card and tried to find a picture on our card lasted less than a minute. It was VERY easy for the 10 year old and even very easy for the 5 year old. So I think the age recommendations on this game are wrong -- I think it would be better for younger kids.We love the I Spy books, so we're going to try to come up with some variation that makes it harder and makes it last longer. Spending a few minutes to pick cards and get ready, to then have the turn over in 30 seconds, it just not a very fun time. But the game seems well made and the pictures are nice, so we'll find some variation to play."
5,amazing!,"Dark & down, but definatley not out- Soul Rush is an incredibly upfront, heartfelt singer songwriter album. Reminds me on different occasions of Jeff Buckley, Van Morrison, even Ryan Adams, yet this guy still has a really unique (and incredible!) voice. If you like any of those artists (as I do), I'd suggest checking out this CD."
3,Flush Rush 4 Mush,"There are some great moments on this CD. Dunger uses a jazz band approach that pays off on the sway of ""Doctor Zhivago's Train,"" ""And without a reason it blows you away."" ""Soul Rush"" has a nice build, some solid lyrical imagery, and even a banjo picking away. ""Something New"" pumps with a delightful energy & would be a wonderful track with a more distinctive melody line. The brass on ""Ballad of a Relationship"" enhances the somewhat sluggish vocals. The problem with ""Soul Rush"" is that Dunger's style and vocal performances are more interesting than his songs. ""Pass the Chains"" is deadly while many of the middle tracks are faceless. I think his Van Morrison-like style entranced some critics, which is why I searched out for this. That said, a couple tracks are nice if you want to build your own compilation, but this is not a disc that calls out to be played repeatedly. It's more interesting than affecting. Taxi!"
5,No stretch marks,I used this for the latter part of my pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks. It was wonderful.
5,The one and only,"When I was growing up, my family listened to Volume 1 so much that the lines (""These sessions do him so much good"") became part of the fabric of our conversation. Now with a CD, we can catch our spouses up on the stories so they can understand the jokes we're making. (And with a few decades under our belt, we understand some of the allusions better.)I hadn't heard Volume 2 until I got this set. To be honest, I don't think it's as good; some of the jokes seem like retreads from Volume 1, and the last track with actual interviews of kids about President Kennedy (""What does the President do?"") is more precious than funny. But some of the Volume 2 cuts are still standouts (and if you want, just toss Volume 2 and enjoy the original). Overall, a wonderful example of surprisingly long-lived humor. It's no surprise that Volume 1 was the best-selling album of its time."
5,Flash Back,"What a wonderful flash back to the 60's. My parents played this album over and over. I never in a million years thought I could find a copy. Not only was it easy to find, but it was a good price. The item arrived quickly, correctly and in great condition. This was my first Amazon purchase and it will not be my last!"
3,Possession,"The score to this movie is as hauntingly beautiful and memorable as the movie itself. Great for a relaxing pick me up or a romantic evening. It reminds me of the movie soundtracks Emma and Sense and Sensibility. The reason I rated this a three, however, is because, as lovely as the music is, it struck me as rather repetitive. All I suggest is that you listen to the sample music before you buy it to make sure it is to your taste."
2,Wall Mount Bracket Kit,looks like a great idea but it did not work for me. only the center screw would catch the stud. i was better off using the Lx Wall Mount Arm directly.
2,overpriced for what you get!,"I ordered this little mini doll for my 3 year old granddaughter who loves Angelina Ballerina. I didn't read far enough down the page to realize that is was only 3 inches tall. With shipping, it cost me $24.25 and was very surprised when I opened the box and saw its size. It is not posable and really just a collector's item. The company was nice enough to offer me a refund for it, but I decided to keep it."
3,Great as a cake topper,"I ordered this mini doll for my daughter's birthday cake. She will be turning 4 and wants an Angelina Ballerina party. After receiving it, I think it's a good cake topper but not a good toy. It's pretty fragile and I think it should ship for free."
2,Very small,"I purchased this as an accent for my new granddaughter, Angelina's nursery. Her three-year-old sister saw it and took no interest. It is very small, and not as cute as pictured. Disappointed."
5,Great tie for the Gryffindor costume!,"I bought the Harry Potter Gryffindor V-neck sweater off of Whimsic Alley and hoped that the colors on this tie wouldn't be too red for it. Fortunately, the burgundy color is a bit darker than on the picture on this site, and it went PERFECTLY with the sweater. It's slightly large, but if you manage the knot on the tie, it still makes a good size for someone as small as I am. (I'm only 5'1""!) Very high-quality, I think, as ties go. Very satisfied~ ^.^"
4,Great for an HP Costume,"The perfect colors for a Gryffindor costume. Though I do wish the tie was a bit longer (I'm 6ft), it still works fine for all my costuming needs."
3,Decent,"I needed this figure for the build-a-figure piece inside, but I was excited to have a cool enemy for Wolverine. She's kind of flimsy, and her face is really bad looking. I think just based on the character's coolness alone, she gets three stars, but it's kind of a disappointing figure."
5,Better than it seems at first glance.,"I bought her mostly for her piece of Onslaught, but she's remarkably interesting.A good change of pace form the usual sausage-fest that is my collection, and her arms and fingers make her unique... and offer some hilarious posing possibilities.Her fingers could be better, but she's certainly well crafted. Good comic as well, one of the better ones that come along with the figures.I give my recommendation, if only to get the last bit of Onslaught-y goodness.I put her next to Abom, because I though they look sweet together... In a creepy sort of way..."
2,Poor print quality sheet music,"Plain and simple, this sheet music collection has a good number of interesting songs, but the print quality is very poor. The guitar chords are unreadable on some songs, and the piano music, while readable, isn't crisp at all. It looks like a cheaply bound photocopy."
4,Almost,Satisfied with the purchase in general but not many songs are in a favorable key. Wish I could check that info before I purchase.
3,At a snail's pace,"""Too Marvelous for Words"" is a perfect title for the book of Johnny Mercer songs I purchased. ""Too Slow to Be Believed"" is a perfect title for the delivery of the purchase. It took over 10 days just to get the book shipped, and then it arrived at my door weeks - not days - later.If you want something in a timely manner this is not the sales venue for you."
1,Get the thinpack,"This is a review for the actual product, not the content of the showA word of warning, there are two seraphim collections out there. A thin-pack version, and a terrible one where all the DVDs are just stacked on top of each other on a spindle. Unfortunately i got the horrible spindle variety. if your buying this make sure you get the thin-pack version! im writing this review for the stack pack one but i think Amazon links the two into one review. The Stack pack has the lead character crouching and pointing her gun at you, the better thin-pack has her standing in a kinda sexy pose with her arm above her head. Get that one if you buying the complete collection"
2,"They said this book was Like New, but it has writing ALL over it","I bought this book because they said that it was Like New. However, when I got it, I opened it up and the pages have writing all over them. That, to me, does not mean Like New. I would understand if there were margin notes on just a few pages, or if the pages did not have that much writing on them, but this book has a lot of writing on almost every page. It is difficult to read because of how much writing. I would not buy from this seller again."
3,For Elvis lovers only,"I'm an A number 1 Elvis fan, so I would only caution that this CD will most likely be of interest to others like me. While the opening track ""Smile"" is brilliant, the rest of the CD you'll find a bit of a noisy hodgepodge that typifies Elvis' meanderings of late.For those who have seen him live this year or heard performances on the radio, you will not be surprised by a lot of echo boxes and interpretive reworkings of old songs.Like Prince, even a lesser Elvis tune is better than most artists on a good day. ;) So, Elvis fans, yes, add it to the collection. Casual listeners, stick to the A-list stuff."
3,For the fans,"Occasionally an artist releases something for the fans, alternate cuts, remixes, and live bits that fans will appreciate. That pretty much sums up CRUEL SMILE. Filled with bits and pieces from tours and the WHEN I WAS CRUEL CD this recording has a great alternate cut of ""Spooky Girlfriend"" that beats the original, ""Watching the Detectives"" and ""Uncomplicated"" (Two of my favorites) live and enough other songs of interest for the true fan. OK, we didn't need two takes of ""Smile,"" and it really doesn't hold together as a typical CD; it's just a potpourri of current stuff that was probably lying around the studio. I'm glad he put it out, I'm getting a kick out of it, but I don't think it's for anyone who's not fan of EC."
4,Not Disposable,"I was reticent to buy a CD that contains ""airshots"", ""imposter mixes"", and live tracks. But, Cruel Smile is an excellent companion to the outstanding When I Was Cruel. The versions are significantly different and form a solid CD (much like Gorillaz vs. Spacemonkeyz). Highlights are the previously unavailable When I Was Cruel (No. 1), the driving Spooky Girlfriend (live), the reworked version of Tear Off Your Own Head (It's A Doll Revolution), and an extended jam of Soul For Hire (bonus track).Get it while it lasts. This is strictly limited edition. A must for all Elvis fans.[DW]"
2,Elvis' new flava?,"I guess since this is a ""bonus"" CD for the fans and all, it's really ""review-proof"" -- but that ain't gonna stop me. First of all, I have to say that it's worth shelling out...bucks or so just to hear ""When I was Cruel (no.1)"", which is a stunning song. But, unfortunately, that's about it as far as ""Cruel Smile"" goes -- the disc's other 67 minutes are either failed trip-hop remixes of ""When I Was Cruel"" tunes or ho-hum live war horses. Oh, and then there's two versions of the old standard ""Smile"" -- although I have no idea why...."
5,What Can I Say? I Think It's Great!,"My two cents: GREAT alternate mixes of GREAT songs. And even if you should disagree how can anyone disparage--or for that matter do without--this live material (especially ""Almost Blue"")? The beat box responsible for this definitive solo performance of ""Spooky Girlfiend"" was destroyed in a flood, so this release may prove to be the only document of the unique and quite rewarding period in Costello's career when he was in a nice creative zone between solo performer and rock and roll frontman.Three dollars that just might change your life."
5,A real page turner book on relational database design!,"I bought this book because I needed to understand relational data base design in a hurry. I was not able to put it down because its clear discriptions and interesting easily understood examples hooked me into the early morning hours. The author anticipated, then answered every mental question I had, right on cue. This book is like reading the clearest lecture notes from a great database design college course. For example, her lesson on normalization levels was not only easy to understand but fun to read! Yes, this book was a joy, not a task to read and understand. Enjoy!"
2,beginner oriented,Clearly a beginner's text. Positive in that it does mention object-relational design. Can be read in a day but contents are not substantial enough in my opinion. Somewhat disappointed in Morgan Kaufmann for publishing this work. Teorey's volume I'd prefer.
2,Excruciating...Predictable...Unrealistic,"I struggled through this novel because I loved PASSING and looked forward to reading Ms. Jones' latest work. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The story line was very interesting but it took so long to get to the climax that the build up was hardly worth it.The premise of a black doctor's struggle between his obligation as a healer and with being faced with saving a horrible bigot is not a new one but I was hoping that the story would have done more to satisfy the appetite. Jones brought you in, held you and then finished in a very uninspired way. The relationships between the women characters were strong and I liked that, but overall the book was a letdown.C.M. Miller, author---Taxes, Death, & Trouble"
1,HATED IT!,"I have got to say that this has been the most boring book I have ever read. I am an avid reader, it is not unlike me to finish a novel in a single day but this book, I could not get into. I found it extremely boring. I had to give up, it was an effort to read it. I never even made it to the halfway mark. The characters are dry and uninteresting. The author spends way too much time describing everything, what the building looks like, what Lila is thinking, why Lila's husband (can't remember his name) became a doctor, blah, blah, blah. The characters don't have conversations, they just think all the time. I'm glad I found this book on the clearance rack for $$$ otherwise I would of returned it but alas, all is not lost, I have a wobbly table that could use some balance."
5,Something different,"Red on a rose is the sequel to Passing. Lila is now married to Dr. Jack Calloway, and has her own on-line reading program. When Jack makes, a decision that Lila don't agree with, the marriage starts to suffer. This book give us a look at other problems that might come up in marriage beside cheating, or money problems."
3,An OK read,It too long for the story to develop but overall it was o.k. If the author would have been alive to finish the story it would have been a better read.
2,Poor Follow-Up to Passing,I loved Passing! As a matter of fact I just re-purchased it since I never did get the copy back that I loaned out years ago and I really enjoyed the story. Red on a Rose was a nose dive from Passing and quite disappointing. The story line was almost if not depressing to me. I will have to read the author's 3rd book it looks like that I just noticed and see if it meets the same interest as Passing did.
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your precious reading time on this book. This book was not the least bit interesting or profound in any way. I had to skip whole paragraphs, then finally whole chapters, just to survive to the end."
5,A must have for the Borzoi fancier,"This is an outstanding book for anyone interested in the Borzoi breed. Mrs. Groshan's insight into Borzoi reveals her true love of this remarkable breed. Interpretations of several standards help the novice as well as the veteran exhibitor visualize the perfect Borzoi. Histories of many kennels are included, along with many invaluable photographs."
3,Too old for current use,"I was interested in current information about the breed. This book was printed in 1981. In addition, far too much time is spent talking about the ancient history of the breed. Some historical information would have been welcome, but I would estimate that more than 65% of the book deals with the breed in czarist Russia. I respect the lady's knowledge, but my reason for buying the book was to find out if the breed is right for me, not to be a historical scholar of Russian history."
2,Must have been a hit before MTV,This film is intersting but drags on when it shouldn't. The characters are generally boring. I watched this when i couldn't fall asleep.
2,"Antonioni, the king of pretension","I once saw a magazine list of the greatest movies of all time that had this movie as number one. So, I was very interested in finally seeing it. When I finally did, years later I was mystified as to why it was chosen. Since then I've seen other Antonioni pictures and to me, his films are the archetypes of the annoying foreign film pretending to reveal the deep mysteries of life to you but delivering nothing. The rich often lead shallow aimless lives. No kidding. A dope like Kurt Cobain could figure that out too and only take up three minutes of my time in saying it. See Bergman's Wild Strawberries or Welles' Chimes at Midnight for some substance."
2,L'Avventura,"Highly stylized and nice to look at. Not much happens in this long movie, though. I have a high tolerance for deliberately paced foreign movies, but L'AVVENTURA's substanceless beauty left me cold."
2,A boring film about boring people,"A boring film about a group of spoiled selfish Italians who talk a lot about themselves, symbolizing, one supposes, the emptiness of ""modern life"". The group go on a trip and one gets lost. Who cares? Set in the otherwise beautiful islands of the Mediterranean - white stone and blue sea - and filmed in black and white presumably to make the point that the characters are spiritually empty - and boring! Point taken."
2,Not the best Italian cinema has to offer,"I am a fan of Italian cinema, however I dislike this movie. The first hour or so are very engaging. Even though a bunch of people are wandering around on an insland, you can feel your mind racing about what might have happened. After the first hour, it just goes nowhere. You'd have to be a film student to really enjoy this movie in its entirety. Like Fellini films, this flick goes off on tangents at times, but they are boring."
2,"and no, tom hanks is not my favorite actor.","i first saw this movie back in...2009 and i didn't like it. maybe if i'd seen in when it came out in 1960 i'd understand what the fuss is about. it was pleasant to see sicily 15 years after the war hence the 2 stars. i imagine that, like the rest of the western world, the island is a dump anymore. skip it."
5,Twice is a must!!!,"Stock your film sense with this one! The first time I saw this movie I had to take a break mid way...I was bored with it. I came back after my break and labored to the end. I then thought surely their is more to this movie then I let myself see. I turned on the commentary and heard him say you are about to watch one of the best movies ever made. I thought ""HUH!?"" I then listened to the commentary and viewed the scenes in a different light...I now agree with the commentator. It is one of the best movies ever made! You will not regret the time you spend the second and third time around with this one...in fact with the commentary I realized how short the movie was!"
3,CalcCenter 3 Review,"CalcCenter 3, in two words, Mathematica Lite. CalcCenter 3 has some of the features of Mathematica but not enough, I suspect, for most users of mathematical software. It's a superb equation solver with excellent graphics, but falls short in other areas. One can solve most equations and systems of equations for real and complex solutions and graph in two and three dimensions. The differential equation solver solves systems as well, just numerically not symbolically. There are many other excellent features and it's a very easy program to learn and to use. If it were the year 2000 for the price today it would the mathematical bargain of the century. But its' 2009 and depending on your occupation or avocation, you can purchase Mathematica 7 close to the same price. If you can, bypass CalcCenter and go directly to Mathematica 7. It would not surprised me if Wolfram discontinues CalcCenter 3 soon.Gary Wardall"
1,The Most Laughable Dialogue,"I am a movie buff and love films, especially independent, offbeat ones. So I thought this would be a good one for me . . . well, was I wrong! After watching this movie, I thought that it had to be one of the worse ever made! The plot is worse than OK, but the casting of plain Nancy Travis as ""sexy"" lounge singer Lucille was unbelievable. Nancy Travis is just not sexy. The worst thing about this movie, though, is the dialogue. The characters refer to Vegas as ""this Godforsaken town"" so many times, you could make a drinking game out of it! Unless you are the most diehard Tarantino fan, or you just can't get enough of Dylan McDermott, you should probably avoid this movie!"
1,"Monkeys have tails, and chimpanzees dont","This was a horrible movie. I actually paid to see it in the theater, what was I thinking??!!"
3,Not as bad as amazon.com wants you to believe!,"I watched this movie at 2 a.m. and found it had enough to keep me awake! Takes a sophisticated sense of humor to catch the dryness underlying the wit. Unusual plot. Fun to visit Vegasespecially if you're living in rain-soaked country. Enjoy it as fun, not a work of art."
1,"Oh, My God....","Been watching this movie a couple of times and laughing at it because it's such a horrible movie. remember watching the trailer for this one on youtube and saying to myself ""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP?!"". can see why people that saw this god awful crap say it sucks. don't bother with this flick. although to be honest, it's another movie i watched because i wanted to drool over dylan and i'll once again admit that i almost lost it when he was in his birthday suit only from the waist up since a table was covering his privates."
3,Well...,"It works, but it has a tenancy to peel up, roll up, or otherwise stick to things besides the table (like a parallel guide or triangles) and comes up. I'd recommend drafting dots as opposed to tape, but as far as tape goes, this is pretty good quality tape."
5,Dependable Tape,"I use this tape to hold my watercolour paper to my board. It works great - holding securely and letting go without damaging the paper. I do always stick it to my clothes, first, to make it a little less sticky. It's one of my art supply staples!"
1,way too harsh!,"My pitbull suffers from seasonal allergies and overall dry/itchy skin and this shampoo not only smelled AWFUL, but was so harsh that he now has flaky skin to boot! My vet described a much gentler Epi-Soothe shampoo and conditioning rinse combo so we'll see if we can correct the damage done by sulfodene. If your dog's coat is sensitive and already quite dry, a strong deodorizing shampoo may prove too aggressive."
5,exelente libro bueno para cualquier chef,exelente libro de cocina la verdad que estoy muy contento por comprarlo muy bueno para chef y personas que quieran saber mas de condimentos
3,Not a review.,"This isn't actually a review, but I thought I might mention that ""Murder After Hours"" is the old American title of ""The Hollow."" ""The Hollow"" is in print. So, for those of you interested in buying ""Murder After Hours,"" just search for ""The Hollow."""
1,junk blades do exist,"I have experience using these blades so cuting technique is not the issue. I bought this blade to cut through some 3 inch round steel pipe 3/16"" wall. Now I have heard that some blades even good blades are bad just because a bad batch exists so maybe I just got one that was just bad from the get go. First cut, beautiful, second cut just as nice, third cut took more time. Cut #4 was it. The blade would not penetrate the pipe and can't even cut 1/8"" angle now. TRULY DISAPPOINTED!!! My milwaukee 14"" Dry Cut Saw sat for 5 days until my SAIT blade arrived. My Milk blade has been mailed out for sharpening. I hope when it comes back after costing me around $200 it is worth it but it has not stood up to my SAIT blade which made 85 cuts in the same pipe."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. It doesn't contain much information on making flowers or figures, and much of what is in the book is elementary. It seems more like an advertisement for Winbeckler's other products than a tutorial."
4,Love it!!,"I love this book. There are some items that don't really need to be in there. But, overall, it's a great technique that actually works."
2,"good looks, bad sound and reception","I bought this phone because I like my AT&T digital answering machine and I wanted something compact and nicely designed. And the price was right.Now I know why this phone is so cheap; the reception is terrible. Everyone I talk to sounds like they're calling from a tin can. Granted, I live in an NYC apartment but my old Sony cordless was able to deal with that just fine."
1,Disappointment,"This phone was purchased after a history with wonderful AT&T phones, but this purchase was a disappointment. The phone is absolutely horrible. Either there is such static on the line you can not hear the other person, the buttons do not work to dial or to turn it on or off. It turned out to be a complete waste of money, being that I had to purchase a new phone to replace this inadequate one. I would think twice about ever buying another AT&T cordless phone."
4,...but guess what the members of this band are up to now?,"Pretty fair review, I've owned this album since the mid-nineties and always thought there were some great songs but the album is very much something for it's time due to the production/sounds.Keyboard player/producer Gareth Young was recently the brains behind a UK No.1 for the band Appleton and vocalist Treana heads up and coming indie act Wire Daisies (www.wiredaisies.com)."
3,"Some Interesting Characters, Some Not","This book bumps up against the contemporary reality that we are regularly exposed to peculiar people through news and entertainment media. This book includes some extremely odd people but it also spends a good deal of time discussing people who were odd a century ago but quite dull by today's standards. Seems to me that the author needed a sharper focus. Was it purely to entertain? Was it to give a historical sense that eccentrics have always been a part of the community? Was it simply an attempt to restate in narrative form the notion of ""to each his own?"" Any one of these might have called for some change in the material or a sharper edge to the narrative.Having said all that, if individuals with odd beliefs and eccentric notions are of particular interest to the reader, there are some notable characters to be found in this book."
5,The book with a great ironic title,"This novel is one of the best pieces in the world of fiction. Tough and smooth, realities of life are revealed in this book. The novel demonstrates Shaukat Siddiqi's strong command and control on characters and plot that lead the reader to the end of the journey, which takes place in God's own Land."
2,The G5 does not support Virtual PC,"The G5 does not support Virtual PC. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this computer!"
1,Defective polymer soles,"I bought these black Nunn Bush shoes to wear mostly for going out to various events. In the past year I have worn there perhaps 6 times for about 4 house at a time. Between wearing they were stored in their shoe box stuffed with paper as they came from the store. Recently when I put them on and started walking, the soles began to deteriorate leaving black marks and small pieces of the heel on my floors. The black marks were like adhesives and could only be removed by scraping. The shoes are totally worthless. Has anyone else seen this problem?"
5,Stylish and Comfy,"I bought these shoes for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves them! They have ""Comfort Gel"" heel inserts and sturdy, but flexible soles which make wearing them a pleasure.I would definitely but these again and recommend them highly."
3,Questional quality,"They were comfortable when first worn, but seem to scuff very easely. They could use better polish. The insole seems to be breaking down quite rapidly and leaving a large dip under the ball of the foot."
1,nunn good,I've had these shoes before but this pair is already worn out. Bad lot or deteriorating quality? Not sure what to do now about a new pair.
5,Husband Work Shoes,These are the only shoes my husband has found that are wide enough and comfortable for him to wear to work all day. We searched everywhere for them and found them here. He is wearing his old ones as long as possible since they seem to be hard to find!
4,Nice comfortable shoes,"I bought these several months ago and they still look good. The construction is very good, the fit is good. They have a medium thickness sole and heel, so you won't seem shorter wearing these compared with let say, most deck shoes. No squeaky noise when walking. I think they look good. I wear them to work (business casual). I would buy them again."
1,"Very Comfortable, BUT...",I have had many pairs of these shoes over the years and have always been happy with them. They are very comfortable but the last two pairs I've owned have only lasted a few months. They must have change the hardness of the sole to a softer rubber for more cushion. The draw back is the soft sole wears very quickly. I would not recommend these shoes.
1,"Good shoe, but bad service from Amazon.","This is a good shoe, but I was shipped the wrong size twice. The web interface is poor, it does not allow the shopper to review the size ordered. The ""Shopping Cart"" reviews the item ordered, but does not repeat the size, so the purchaser can't double check the size before paying."
4,marce from the bronx,i received the nun bush shoes and i was in love with the fit. wide enough for by huge feet and very comfortable. price was right. and they look fantastic and represented a higher priced shoe. i can walk all day with these shoes and no problem. and thats what i bought them for. very satisfied.
5,Most Comfortable shoe,This si my second pair I have bought and they still hold up to its value. Very light and soft on the soul of the foot. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a shoe that brings comfort to thier feet when wearing a shoe all day long.
5,Sturdy,"These shoes are sturdy! I wanted something with the feel of a tennis shoe but would be ""dressy"" enough to wear with dockers and casual business clothes. This fits the bill. They're both comfortable and sturdy and seem like they'll last me a while. Worth every penny!"
5,I love these shoes!,"I bought a pair of these same shoes 10 years ago and have worn them as my ""at home"" shoes when I had to dress more formally at work. When I am able to dress down at work, I wear these. These shoes are so comfortable, flexible and fit very well. I hope Nunn Bush never stops making them. I just bought a new pair because my old ones have worn soles, but the tops are still fine and my old pair are now my cabin shoes. I am considering buying another pair just in case they might stop making these. I rub some shoe oil on them once a year and some light wax in the winter time. Thank you Nunn Bush."
3,"Bush-Nunn Cameroon, Brown",I've worn about 7 pair of these shoes over the last 3 years. Initially I thought they were a decent shoe for the money but my opinion has changed. Recently the ball of my right foot has started to hurt. It took me a while to discern the cause but it is the shoe. They last about 2-3 months and then degrade rapidly. The laces are also a problem. I won't be buying them again. I need a better made shoe.
2,Not a good purchase,"I am, for the first time ever, amending my review. I can't recommend these shoes. I had had them less than a couple of months before they were scuffed so badly that they made me embarrassed to wear them. It's got something to do with the high-gloss finish. Don't buy."
1,Who made these crummy shoes?,This is the third pair of this exact shoe of this style and size I've bought but these are different. The left shoe feels like the sole is crooked and they are measurably wider. I couldn't be more disappointed. Have to wonder if somebody else made them???
1,I hate these shoes.,I purchased these shoes thinking that I was getting the Nunn Bush Colton shoe and was very disappointed. These shoes run very wide for their size and do not fit good at all. The Colton is a much better shoe in my opinion. I will be giving these to the clothes closet at my church in hopes that someone can wear them. I hate these shoes.
1,Defective- Hopefully a one time event,"Bought these in black, size 11W right after Christmas 2011. Began wearing them to work in January 2012 (office environment). Within 30 days the soles on both shoes began separating from the body of the shoe. After a couple more days the left sole had separated over halfway off the shoe (felt like I had clown shoes). I contacted ShoeMall and they promptly sent a pre-paid shipping label to return for refund....way to go ShoeMall!I have faithfully purchased Nunn-Bush shoes for years and the last two pair of the Cameron's I had lasted for about 2 years each. I will try again...maybe I just got a Friday afternoon special off the assembly line. Hopefully this is not a sign of systemic issues with their overseas manufacturing"
2,Comfortable but extremely poor wear,"After 3 months the soles on both shoes are cracked and worn showing hollow areas within the sole. I am used to shoes lasting several seasons at least - I wear winter shoes in the winter, replacing them every several years, and the same for summer shoes. I don't expect shoes to last only 3 months. Overall they are comfortable once one gets used to the ""Comfort Gel"" inserts at the heel. These shoes will be going back to the non-Amazon store where they were purchased."
3,"Comfortable, but loud.","My husband has worn this pair of shoes for several months now, and although they are very comfortable and have held up well, he complains all the time that he can't stand them because they squeak so loudly on the floors in the office. He's decided he's getting rid of them and that's why I'm here shopping for a new pair."
2,Coulda been a lot sexier...,Theres some topless shots and alot of implied stuff that doesn't really show 'the goods' There's a couple sex with clothes on scenes. Woulda been better to have more nudity in it.
1,didnt care for it,"I did not care for it : 1. Poorly done, 2.seemed like cheap porn trying to be a movie i started it then quit did not aWatch the whole thing"
3,A Decent Urban Vampire Tail,"It wasn't flashy, and there there were several plot holes, unanswered questions, and a few of the actresses weren't the best, but all in all it was an OK low-budget vampire flick that kept my attention the whole time.Another reviewer seems to think this was intended more as soft-core erotica, and if that was the case then it failed in its endeavor. It did have some titillating scenes but nothing to write home about, but that didn't seem to be the focus. So I doubt that was the film-maker's primary intent. It felt more like an early, indie, stab at vampire horror.Worth the rental, worth the watch. It won't be one I'll probably watch again though."
4,Great educational toy,"This is one of the few N. America puzzle maps available for purchase. It's overall very good - but for a beginner. The reason I say beginner, and this is also my criticism of the map, is for 2 reasons.First, this map is very detailed with the states and capitols of each state and country in North America, but it excludes Mexico. For example, all of the Canadian states and USA states are included, but the Mexican states are excluded.Second, it is confusing for a beginner to understand that 1 puzzle piece includes several states. For example, all of the New England states are grouped together. It's hard to teach a beginner that there are 5 or 6 states on one puzzle piece, especially when it's so small."
5,How Could I Resist?,"I want to relive my carefree college days by buying my favorite artists from back in the day. My personal favorite from this album is ""Pray"". It almost sounds more gospel than rap."
3,Superb start for the New Pastor,"If you happen to be just coming into ministry, as am I. I would recommend you get this book. Dr. Powell does a wonderful job of laying it out as to exactly how a new pastor should approach a smaller church to start their pastorate. Dr. Powell is a experienced and knowledgeable pastor and former Baylor regent."
5,exquisite,"The musicianship throughout this CD is a marvel. Peter Schreier's wonderful, pure tenor, and the outstanding chamber orchestra of the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart, whose lead instrumentalists shine on every track, make this a lovely recording for Bach enthusiasts. Sadly, there are no liner notes, so the soloists are not identifiable. One of my favorite tracks is # 2, ""Frohe Hirten, eilt"", with its crisp and glorious string section.At the helm is Helmuth Rilling, one of the world's great Bach masters, and his pacing is perfection.Peter Schreier, who was born in 1935 and had his early musical training from his father, a Church Kantor, has been singing since childhood, and though he has gained acclaim as an opera and lied singer, he is much loved for his interpretations of oratorios, usually in the part of the Evangelist.The sound on this excellent recording is good, and total time 47'58."
2,Stick with your old 8.0,For starters this new version takes about twice as long to load up when you open the program. When I'm working with this 9.0 version I keep getting the hour glass every time while working with some tools. It's always processing stuff. I NEVER encoutered this with 8.0 version. After a while it gets really annoying. I purchased this newer version because Adobe finally figured out how to support transparency in Illustrator. I have still yet to get it to work. Even my neighbor (who runs a graphics company) can't figure out how to make this Windows transparency thing work. I think the Mac versions are much more of a breeze though. Anyway long story short I continue to just use my 8.0 Illustrator while using PhotoShop for transparency stuff. 9.0 is a waste of money!
4,It just gets better,"I have used a version of Illustrator since the first one in 1988. Every subsequent version just keeps getting better. I love the new transparency effects and the interconnectivity with web graphics. The primary engine for Illustrator is now based on PDF but I really wish it was more stable. I sometimes get the annoying and certainly cryptic ""PDF is having trouble saving the file"". The workaround for that is to save as an older version but I am looking forward to 10.0."
4,A book for professionals,"The book gives good quality, in depth information about the Windows kernel and system architecture. The way it was written (approach by example where possible) is a clear advantage for the reader. However, the information is better understood and assimilated if the reader also accompanies his/her study of a topic with reading through the Windows Platform SDK, DDK(newly WDK) header files."
5,Excellent technical reference,"I purchased this book mainly to get detailed information about the NTFS file system. Not only did it satisfy this areas of interest, but I found it to be very informative in associated system areas such as the cache and virtual memory. I feel this book was an excellent purchase."
5,Great Service,Book ordered was received in a flash. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this vendor again.
5,Wish I could give it more stars,"I read a LOT of ""computer books"" and this doesn't even fall into the same category! This is required reading if you want to get a glimpse at what Windows is truly all about.Mark E. Russinovich and David A. Solomon have once again put together a true masterpiece. This book is very well written and has information that you just can't get anywhere else. I think one of the best things that this book does is actually gives you real world ways you can apply this knowledge - not just a bunch of theory.To see a little more about the level of expertise behind this book check out Mark's site at www.sysinternals.com - you will also find some VERY helpful tools at that site, both free and for sale. If you do anything in Windows support you recognize that site!"
5,System level Book,"Firstly I think that the writers have done hard work to writeThis book, anyhow this book give the reader what he need toUnderstand the architecture of Windows NT with experiments, but the good thing it give the reader good base to understand the Vocabulary that related to the windows system so you can easily understand.I am a beginner device driver programmer, and I found the missing Topics ignored by other books. Also it is comprehensive book I think every SYSTEM SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER has to own a copy of it."
2,Bit of a Screw Job - Review 2,"In a past review I labeled the book a bit of a screw job. That was somewhat unfair. My biggest gripe is the lack of an ebook. In the past the ebook has proved an extremely useful tool and I believe critical to using the information in the book.Its too harsh to associate Mr Solomon and Russinovich with an obvious action by Microsoft to squeeze a few more dollars from us. It really isn't fair to criticize them as they maintain MS has the final descision of ebook availability.I have absolutely no issues technically with the book. Its well written as technical tomes can be and I believe accurate. How ultimately useful, is open to debate because of what it lacks."
1,Disappointing results,"I purchased the Lexar Image Rescue 2.0 software because I was having trouble with two Lexar 1GB Professional CompactFlash memory cards. The case containing the software CD arrived broken. The installation instructions that came with the software are poor and I had to contact Lexar for further instructions. Their recommendation was to install once, remove, and install again. Did not make a lot of sense but it did work.At the end, the software did not solve my problem, it recovered frames containing checkers from 3 or 4 different pictures. Which led me to eventually discover that the Lexar memory cards were not compatible with my camera (Canon 20D). Lexar replaced the cards with new compatible cards for free, shipment of the bad cards not included. Time and money wasted."

5,"Thank you, Mr. Schulz!","It's a sign from heaven: The boxed set of the 1950-1954 Peanuts comics. Now, who doesn't know who Charlie Brown or Snoopy is? The kid with the rotten luck (he gets rocks while trick-or-treating) and the awesome dog. Here it is, folks, the once-rare pieces of work from Charles Schulz, who is now resting in peace. I think that this is what he would have wanted:millions of people to enjoy his work for future generations. I salute you, Mr.Schulz, for bringing this to us. Bless your heart."
5,The Complete Peanuts 1950-1954 Boxed Set,"I have a 41 year old son that loves the stories of Charlie Brown. He recently mentioned that he had the original Charlie Brown book we gave him as a small boy. I saw the collection on the website and thought it would make a great Christmas present for him this year. I can only say that he will love them and when I told his 13 year old son what I had done he said his dad would be really ""cool"" with them.After Christmas I will let you know how my gift was received. Charles Schulz has been a favorite of ours since the very beginning."
1,"Saw great, battery's design faulty","It is a shame that what I think is a great saw is hindered by lousy battery engineering. The battery is a BL1830.There is an intelligent circuit inside the pack that needs to be powered, and it draws its power from the very cells it is monitoring.The basic design flaw is that the circuit is wired to be powered by only one of the many cells in the pack. The PCB draws a constant although small current from that single cell. If the battery is not used for a few weeks then that cell will deep discharge causing a weak link in the bank of cells, the pack then fails in the charger.Makita has programmed the circuitry so that if you try to charge the battery 3 times in this state, it will permanently disable it. Normal behavior is to think ""why is it not charging, let me try again"". If more than 1 year old, it is out of warranty.I would not buy any more Makita tools powered by this battery."
4,Remarkable,"I spent years as a contractor buying heavy, powerful hand tools and ignoring battery powered tools. I am a convert, now, however. I don't do the heavy work I used to do, but I used this saw and the drills and drivers to build a 30'x10' floating dock using heavy materials and everything went smoothly, When it became necessary to change batteries I was ready for a break myself. Buy extra batteries as this speeds you along. With these batteries, the spare was always charged and ready by the time it was needed."
2,"weak, expensive, not a replacement for a corded saw","Bought it, used it, returned it the following day. Lacks power and endurance even for simple, light duty tasks. I realize it's a cordless saw but for $300 I couldn't have been more unimpressed. It's equally horrible to the cordless Dewalt I bought ten years ago. You would think cordless saw technology would have gotten better by now. It hasn't. Don't waste your money. Buy something else."
3,Speed clips,Not really impressed with these. The have a tendency to unclip on me. As you move the webbing moves. When the webbing moves the hooks on the end of the speed clips come undone.
2,Great premise lacks substance,"Hitler makes a pact with the devil for world domination. Excellent premise. It's the execution that's lacking. The first few chapters are great. Hitler is the main character. The author did his historical research.After Hitler commits suicide (which is not a spoiler because it's historical fact) the novel shifts to four treasure hunters. They are a likable bunch.However, the reader is left with a question: What does this all have to do with Hitler? We are finally told that in the last chapter.The last chapter is rushed and far-fetched. It is a shame because the story was very enjoyable. This book can be read in a day or two.Yes, this story is entertaining but the ending has absolutely no bite."
1,Do not buy,"If you just want to look at the screens recorded, that's fine. If you want to export the file to the other device or DVD, forget this. Very limited DVD format for burning. DV output port to PC requires special device driver from Victor company in Japan. and the device file can not be found in the world. I was deeply disappointed with this machine and JVC."
4,"meschan, radiology","dear sir,how long is the ship to my country ?what's is the payment for the ship ?thank tou for your attention.riantono sutomo"
3,Ehhh...,"It's just ok. It's very light, kind of hard to use to curl or straighten hair. I wouldn't buy it again if I had it to do over."
3,Not good enough,"The performance of the songs is great as usuall, but the girl isnt as good as Bobby is, i think she is a little bit nervious(africa, hold the line) and she didnt make her best.Besides, Simon plays better in the annivesary album, the drums are pretty important in TOTO.If you are looking for a nice live version of ""I ll be over you"" you should buy this, but NOT if you want nice vesrsions of ""Georgy Porgy"" and ""99"".Those really sucks¡"
5,simply splendid,"mr. gould was world renowned for his interpretations of many of bach's works for keyboard. here is a fine example of why--the playing is superb as gould evokes the passion and the energy of bach's french suites. these suites are not as lengthy nor as involved as the english suites, but they afford enough challenges to the pianist to make them mechanistic and devoid of feeling as the artist simply tries to make it through. here, though, there is a joy that comes through. mr. gould makes these completely crafted pieces sound improvisational and almost momentary in their construction. in short, they're fun to listen to. the effortlessness, though, is an illusion. the quality of the playing is entirely indicative of the effort applied. get this cd and enjoy!"
3,Way too fast,"As much as I love Glenn Gould, I think Bach's music was written mainly for the enjoyment of the soul. Anytime I listen to this recording I cannot savour it properly. Gould plays them at a devilish speed. It is fine to appreciate Gould's skills, but the grace of this music is lost in the process. Try Richter instead."
5,Real Men do get spider veins,"I know because I am one of them! After reading this book, I became much more comfortable and less anxious about my problem. I thought I was the only man to have this condition. Not only that, I learned what I could do about it and was thrilled to realize that it isn't the end of the world. This book was easy to read and helped me find the best treatment. Also, in my job I do a lot of flying and I learned from the book that I was at high risk for developing blood clots--and what I could do to prevent them."
5,I Love Raffi!I,I play this CD during bathtime for my 18 month old granddaughter...it is relaxing and sets the tone for the soon-to-be bedtime!
4,Puts me to sleep too!,This CD is great for putting preschoolers to sleep and keeping Mommy entertained too. I usually get really sleepy listening to it.
5,Another masterpiece from Raffi!,"Raffi has done it again, another brilliant piece of work from this amazing artist! I bought this CD when I was expecting my son, & he has been listening to it at bedtime since we brought him home from the hospital. It never fails, by the 3rd song my son is asleep. He just celebrated his 1st Birthday & this CD is still part of our nightly routine. Beautiful songs in that soft, soothing, familiar voice. A gentle blend of songs that soothe the soul. Blessed Be is a song that will touch your heart. Any home with a newborn needs this calm, quiet CD."
2,I don't get it -,"I'm previewing cds from the library before purchasing for my new grandson. The first Raffi cd I listened to - ""Rise and Shine"" - was wonderful. This one though is a mixture of styles that seemed disjointed. Twinkle Twinkle is whiny, Sunflower is beautiful, Like me and you has a nice concept, but doesn't seem all that restful, since there's no repetition, it's just a litany of kids names and the countries they're from. One of my criteria is that the cd must be enjoyable for adults as well as kids, and this one just isn't that great from my perspective.I'm happy to see that other reviewers' kids enjoyed the cd, but I just don't get it."
5,Raffi Quiet Time,"Having enjoyed Raffi's music for my own children, I was happy that his music was still available for me to purchase for my granddaughter, and for other little people, as gifts. His music is timeless and his clear, soothing voice is very appealing to the ear."
5,COME EXPLORE THE LIFE OF HEMINGWAY PALIN STYLE!,"Michael Palin to me makes travel so enjoyable. This two part series is one I highly recommend for everyone to see. This was a new challenge for Michael and he does an excellent job. The videos are a look into the life of Ernest ""Papa"" Heminway and the places he lived. What makes it fun is how Michael tries to emmulate Heminway by trying some of his hobbies which are hunting and fishing. Of course, I can't forget Michael's great sense of humor which is what I love most. I feel like I have traveled with Michael to all these places which include Spain, France, Italy,and Key West. I loved the feature on my hometown of Chicago. Again, even if you have never read Hemingway like myself you will enjoy this two part series."
2,"Good design, bad execution","I have the same issues as several other reviewers: the diverter does not shut off flow completely. Flow volume is good, and flow is enough to have satisfactory pressure to both the showerhead and handheld simultaneously. But neither off position completely stops water from flowing through. Worse yet, it leaks from every single connection point and seam."
2,Bad design,"I liked the looks of this valve but the holes where the water comes out are way too small and decreased the water pressure and flow too much.The bigger issue is that the sliding valves did not fully shut off and when opened, they automatically closed half way due to the water pressure. Makes me wonder if the mfg even tested this product. I sent it back."
3,Forgotten Jimi Jamison's Solo,"Jimi Jamison is best known by the vocalist of Survivor since Vital Signs album but before that he had been doing some of the obscure hard/melodic rock bands such as Target and Cobra that have already been deleted. Since his latest work Empires in 1999 is almost like Survivor, Jim's debut solo album in 1991 might be of more help if you want to find his music tastes and influence. Of course not comparable to Survivor and Empires but it is not so bad album. This is more blues-flavored hard rock than Survivor maybe somewhere between Lou Gramm and David Coverdale. My favorite is True Lovers and Believe In Love. Recommended for die-hard Jimi Jamison fans and some of Ready Or Not and Too Hot To Sleep appreciators."
4,Similar to the Hiding Place,"An excellent account of WWII in Holland. Similar to Corrie ten Boom's ""The Hiding Place"" but more earthy and with less spiritual accounts. The Bible is mentioned far less, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it's still worth reading."
5,Amazing story,"I read this story aloud to my husband as we drove on a long journey. We were sad that it ended. However it is a good complement to The Hiding Place, giving a lot of historical background to that time. Diet was in the same prison as Corrie Ten Boon at one point. Poignant story of God's miracles!"
5,Fantastic,"Please,read this book.This is one of those books you can't put down and when you do have to take a break you can't stop thinking about it and only want to keep reading.It stimulates the mind in such a profound way,making one rethink the important questions.This book has left my brain seering with thoughts and theories and quest for knowledge!Beautifully written it takes you on a journey you don't want to miss.Thanks to the author."
5,Fantastic.,Love this series! Robert Conrad is the perfect actor to play the famous Greg Boyington. This show used real combat footage & filmed aerial scenes to show ww2 combat in the pacific. The show started me on my interest of the history of the Pacific theatre of ww2. Great series.
1,almost a good buy,"this is not amazon's fault......but.....when i purchase a product i want the whole product. i am not interested in buying a part of a season or one show...i want the whole season. If they would charge a fair price for their product, the would sell, but they, i mean the studios, are just sitting around trying to fiqure out a way to screw the consumer out of their hard earned money. so i will not be purchasing any more seasons of black sheep squadron."
5,baabaa black sheep vol 2,excellent series. enjoyed dvd very much. brought back some good memories during running of television show.
5,GREAT SHOW,VERY ENTERTAINING TV SHOW. WILL KEEP YOU WANTING TO WATCH MORE. HUSBAND LOVED IT FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. WE WATCHED BOTH VOLUMES IN 4 DAYS.
4,Straffing Run,"It was as I remembered when it was first on television. This irreverant look at life as a marine pilot, was a roitious adventure. Greg 'Pappy' Boyington bent, broke, shattered the naval regulations every chance he could. although far fetched at times, the series held true to the spirit of the book.The ONLY complaint is that it takes 2 purchases to recieve ALL of season one. (who are these guys? Columbia House??)When is the second season going to draw its' sights on the populas??"
4,Corsair Heaven,"Don't purchase this if you are looking for an accurate history of the air war in the pacific in WW 2. If you are looking for over the top, corny acting and great aerial scenes of Warbirds, this is for you. The series is alot of fun if you keep the right frame of mind and as I said before, you cannot beat the Warbirds in it, not just the Corsairs."
4,Revisiting My Youth,"When I was a teenager, Baa Baa Black Sheep was one of my favorite TV Show's and I was very disappointed when it was taken off the air, after such a short run. Admitably the storyline wasn't very realistic at times, but the aircraft, props, uniforms where always very well done and I always enjoyed the flying scenes. I missed some of the episodes, when it was on TV in Australia, but now that I have Volumes 1 & 2 on DVD, I can watch it whenever I want! I can't wait until Season Two is released on DVD!!"
1,Products that are unavailable?,"Amazon.com:I have always favored shopping at your web site.Dan Rivers Jacquard comforter sets are my all time favorites, I found one on your web site that I love but it is unavailable for an undetermined amount of time. My question therefore is why would your company show items that are not available.I am very disappointed to have found the Dan Rivers comforter set that I would have purchased, after my time and search, your company has failed me by presenting an unavailable product.Thank you in advance for reading my review and for the consideration of all amazon.com shoppers.Most Sincerely,Ponchan1955"
2,Update needed badly,"I spent a few weeks this summer in Cambodia and relied heavily on this book. While this may be the definitive Cambodian guidebook, it is dangerously outdated. So much has changed in Cambodia since the second edition was published in November 1996. Much of the basic information and maps are helpful but I would not rely on any of the places to stay reviews, prices, or schedules. The Cambodia section of the Lonely Planet SE Asia on a Shoestring has a more recent review and was much more helpful. Hopefully an update is in the works."
5,Review for books,Very happy book came on time for class and looks new :) no missing pages and was here a week before it was spouse to great job was worrying but was a huge load off when it was here in time for class.
2,Pages Missing,"I purchased this book with the understanding that it was used. The description mentioned that the cover may have been torn and there may be highlighting. However, there was NO MENTION of MISSING PAGES!!!!!If there were pages missing, I would NOT have purchased the book from facetextbooks! I never inspected the book for missing pages when I got the book, so it was too late to return it when I received my assignments from class."
4,"all in all, pretty good","the learning curve is a little steep for topo usa, but certainly do-able. i really like the profile feature. it is quite useful if you pull a trailer. you can easily see the steep grades. i still prefer ms trips and trips(ver. 2004)to plan routes, and topo usa to review the route."
3,"Broad coverage, but low resolution and small printouts","I guess my expectations should have been lower. If you want to get some information for everywhere, what's in the box is pretty good, about what you will find on the 1:100,000 map sheets. If you want nice-looking detailed printed maps for a specific area, this is not the 1:24,000 7 1/2-minute quad sheets with their fine local detail of structures and landmarks you are used to. First, the data is low-resolution compared to traditional quad sheets. Shorelines and streams are jagged lines rather than smooth curves reflecting local detail, and topo seems to be 25-foot contours whether the terrain is flat or steep and whether 5-foot contours are on the real quads or not. And you can't print quad sheets - there seems to be a hard limit at 11 x 17. I found this useful, but not what I wanted or expected. The sales literature needs to be specific about the limitations - should have a precise spec sheet that makes these limits clear."
2,Topo 6 and 3D,Topo6 does not work in the 3D mode with many new laptops that run microsoft Vista and dont expect it to work anytime soon.
3,It is a toy. Do not try to plan your backpacking trip with it.,"Topo USA is a very good software if you want to sit at your desk and dream about future trips. Do not try to plan details of your trip using their maps.I had both Delorme 3.0 and 6.0. Both suffer from 2 major problems:- Majority of trails even in the National parks (e.g. all over Sierras, Denali, Yellowston) are missing- The database of lakes and rivers and the database of topography are shifted by several hundered feet. Thus, in the maps roads/trails cross the lakes and lakes are located on mountain slopes.If you do not believe me, open their May 2007 advertizement brochure and take a look at the bottom of page 3. It shows a lake on a mountain slope and a river shifted from its riverbed.It makes life miserable if you try to navigate by natural landmarks using a printout of their map."
5,Black Widow,I ordered this book because of the authur. Robin McDonald also wrote a book on the Tokars murder. He covers every angle with verifiable facts from interviews and public accounts. He makes the characters in his books live with fairness to all.
1,"Not true crime, but tabloid fiction","Personally, I find it difficult to become interested in much fiction, so I prefer non-fiction, including true crime. After reading such lines as ""in a state that has earned a reputation for being hopelessly backward and endlessly violent"" and ""Most of the town's (Anniston) residents lost their virginity on one of the back roads..."" I knew that the author was grossly incorrect and that I simply could not trust his judgment or voracity. I beg to differ with this author's ridiculous statement about Alabama being endlessly violent. Having lived in this state for most of my life and working as a court reporter, I am aware of the fact that Alabama is not ""endlessly violent."" Don't waste your money on this tabloid ""journalism."" Give me Ann Rule any day."
5,Jake Trout & The Flounders,I missed purchasing this CD when it was first released.. If you love golf.. Ya gotta buy it.
3,"Silly parodies, clever, but tired.....","I thought this was good, until I heard two other golf music CDs, one by Billy Mac (TEE IT UP) and then read about TEE IT UP in July's GOLF Magazine, they gave it FOUR stars (****). Dueling golf songs, Jake's are spoofs on songs, Mac's are all original and heartfelt. Jakes's for rockin' fun, Mac's for real music and great lyrics. Buy both, I say."
5,Jake rocks.. so does Diesel Dave,"I heard this golf music while visiting South Padre Island and chilling on Diesel's Golf talk show, the only one in the valley. Keep it up Jake. You too, Diesel."
1,Wrong product as to what we Thought,"We thought it was going to be singing about golf,but it was too ""jazzy"" music and hard to understand the words."
1,uhm...,"This movie starts off with some timelapse photography of flowers blooming, which is actually a trailer for the movie that you've already bought. Other parts of note:- The 2nd chapter is the cameraman playing frisbee with his dog.- There is a wasp's nest at 56:19 of Chapter 1.Also, the entire film looks like it was shot on a digital video camera.Enjoy your purchase."
4,Lessons Learned,"This book is great for kids; short (and exciting) enough to keep their interest, and packed with lessons for everyday life. Main character Daniel Martin isn't the brightest kid in school--he gets made fun of a lot. But when he and his classmates get stranded in the wilderness, he saves the day.Will help to teach children not to necessarily judge others by their appearance. Not as charming as Hatchet, but still a great read. Paulsen is definitely a master of tales of the wild."
3,Cameron's Review,"Have you ever been thrown into a river in a car when it is sinking? Well Daniel has in Danger on Midnight River by Gary Paulson. Daniel is with some of the boys from his school. Although he does not like them, he still helps them on their adventure. If you want to find out if Daniel survives you will have to read the book Danger on Midnight River.The age group for this book is between 10 & 12. This book is very adventurous, and it is also helpful for camping. One of the weak points in this book is the ending. And one of the strong points is the crash."
4,Danger on Midnight River,"I like Danger on Midnight River by Gary Paulsen. It was a good adventure story. I liked it because it was realistic and made me think of my life. You see, Daniel (the main character) did not want to go to camp, but he got in the van anyways. Did Danny end up at camp or did he end up somewhere else? Read this adventure story to find out!"
2,Not for me,"This album struck me as ""weak pop."" One of the few albums I own that I don't plan on listening to again. If this is your thing try the Connells or Smithereens for a much better experience."
1,K-TEL?,"Do NOT waste your time on this CD. It's cheap, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. The label (I'll assume) slapped together 10 songs with out even a nod to feel. As a matter of fact, it is part of something called ""Ten Best Series"" that feels a lot like those old K-TEL compilations. Some other fine ""Ten Best Series"" artists included The Babys, Billy Squier, Spandau Ballet, and Corey Hart (I hope that gives you a sense for the bargain-bin feel of this disk - There's not even an insert sleeve for the CD, just a single slip of paper with a picture on the front and a blank back). Had I read a review of this CD, or even been told by Amazon that this was part of some lame series, I would have spent my cash replacing my old 3 years, 5 months..."
4,GREATHEST COOL HITS,"This album contains the best songs of arrested, the sounds of hip hop-reggae is very cool and the lyrics of tennessee, easy my mind, mr wendal, people everyday and united front are all classic."
3,Balancing AD's Scale,"Although some complaints have been made regarding how this collection was assembled, it *does* represent all of AD's released singles from their two studio albums plus the single recorded for the Malcolm X sdtk (""Revolution""). However, it then tosses in a few random songs that maybe the label thought were the ""most listenable""(!?!). Ah well, what can you expect from the major labels anymore? I still prefer to put on 3 Years... or Zinga over this collection, as both albums have either subtle or blatant themes that hold them together, but I suppose if you're in a pinch..."
3,"Great movie, bad sound on DVD","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The picture quality of good, but the sound on this DVD is horrible. Try anohter vendor if you buy this."
5,The Needlepoint Cat,I bought this wonderful book years ago and I still refer to it for backgrounds. There is a cat for every cat loving needlepointer!
5,SIMPLY STUNNING !,"This book may be the best book of photos of classic cars ever published. Simply stunning. The photos of the Duesenberg ""Twenty Grand"" alone were worth the price of the book."
4,A Beautiful Book,"Elegant, pretty, but not designed to give much in the way of details on the cars, or more than one or two pictures per car. But he gives you a top 10, and top 100, and a second 100 - but where are the Triumph roadsters?"
4,Cars can be beautiful,"I'm not particularly a car aficionado (cars for me are something to get me where I'm going and as a last resort, at that), but this book could almost change my mind. Adler picks out what he considers to be the 100 greatest cars of all time, lovingly photographs them, and provides some background on how they came to be.There's an intriguing assortment here. Some cars are veritable icons (we all know what they look like): the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz with its enormous fins, the 1963 Corvette, the Porsche 911, the original Volkswagen Beetle. Others, like the Alfa Romeo BAT 5 are exotic and tend to remind one of the Batmobile. Still others exemplify a type: the Ferrari 250 GTO as the quintessential sportscar, the classic Bentleys with their running boards, the bathtub styling of the 50's Hudsons, and so on.It makes one realize how beautiful a car can be and regret that so many modern cars are little more than aerodynamic boxes with wheels."
5,This is a truly beautiful book!,"I purchased this book for our lobby at work and we gave it to a client who absolutely raved about it. I've replaced the copy and I keep hearing ""ooh""'s and ""ah""'s of appreciation from our clients as they pour over the picures. The photos are large and very clear. The cars are positioned in romantic gorgeous locations which fuels the imagination. I don't expect this copy to stay long either!"
2,"""Life Goes On"" TV Star","Note: The track listing on Amazon.com reflects the correct songs, but the names listed after each song are incorrectly printed. All songs were sung by Tommy Puett. Review: The vocals are alright, but there is a reason Tommy did not record further albums. This item is strictly a novelty item for Tommy Puett fans or fans of the series ""Life Goes On""."
4,A diffrent side of the 'tones,"After producing 2 hard albums, its time for the deftones to take a step back look at whats been done, and think about a little change.The change has come through white pony, although still a rough around the edges. Songs like 'digital bath' show where the band is heading in this album.Although there is this new direction things go back to there normal heavy self in the likes of 'Elite', and others.Overall this album signals a new path for the deftones, and one where they will wisk you away and live you thinking. A very thoughtful and emotive album! :)"
4,voila du bon son!,on retrouve bien ds ce CD les samples de deftones et surtout cette magnifique voix qui m'a fait aime deftones.certes il n'egalera pas leur dernier album mais tendra a lui faire de l'ombre!
4,Good followup to Around the Fur,"I have to say the first two Deftones CD's were better. But this is still good. They should have picked Elite to be their first single. My favorite songs are Digital Bath, ELite, and Change. I recommend you get this cd."
5,Atmospheric rock classic,"This is one of the few albums I own that never, never, never gets old. I mean it! I bought this album right when it came out after liking 'Around the Fur' moderately. I was shocked at how far ahead of the last album this one was! I mean light years ahead! (no disrespect for those who worship 'Around the fur' and 'Adrenaline'.. they are both great albums but simply lack the distinct, brooding atmosphere that the 'Pony' reeks of) I have rarely come across and album as absorbing, and haunting as this.From start to finish, the Deftones bounce back from dark, depressing, atmospheric pieces to violent, heavy tracks that just blend together to create something truly frightening. Chino, of course, stands head and shoulders above the mix, with his droning, dying, beautiful voice. You dont come across something this well put together every day. Intentionally or accedintally 'White Pony' is... amazing... simply amazing.."
4,"a little softer, but still deftones.","While softer, this album maintains the deftones feel to it. It has some bone crunching heavy parts as well as some spine chilling gentle songs. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Definately a heavy somber one,"I bought this album as soon as it came out and played it over and over for awhile. The sounds are incredible because even though the guitars are so up front nothing seems to overpower or distort. It has a lot of great moments in it but I really was impressed with Chino's range, thats some powerful vocal cords.I think it could add to any hard rock fans collection."
3,Some awesome songs on this cd,"I bought this cd without knowing the band, simply by hearing 'change' so I didn't really know what kind of band they were. I'm addicted to Digital Bath, Teenager, Knife Party, and Change. I have yet to listen to the rest of the album properly, some of the rap type songs put me off at first because I'm a rock/alternative type who's not into heavy rock-rap. Overall this is a good cd."
2,Too slow,This cd is way to slow for a deftones cd. I wouldn't say they sold out though they just changed into boring slow band.
2,3rd time is not a charm,"I SO wanted to love this CD, I really did. I have had a copy for months before it came out, so I have gotten the chance to REALLY listen to it. ""Passenger"" with Maynard Keenan from TOOL fame is the first song I heard off the CD. After hearing what came to be my favorite song off that cd, I proceeded to listen to the rest of it with the same expectations. I just could not get into that whole ""be quiet and drive"" vibe through the majority of the CD. ""Elite"" is a good track, and a lot like the harder stuff they are known for. Im not giving this CD 2 stars because it's not hard enough, but because I don't think it is that great. ""Aroung the fur"" had WAY better song structure. I am sure you will listen to this CD and right off the bat you will day ""All right!"" and love it. But just keep listning.....BUT if you are a TOOL fan, I highly recomend listning to ""Passenger"". Maynard and Chino are awesome, and that is a creepy song. Have fun!"
3,WOW,This is a brilliant album. I just couldn't believe it. So much pasion and hate in it. You'll love it if you are a deftones fan
3,Elegant only when elongated,"Credit should be given where it is due, and in the stinking cesspool known as radio-friendly nu-metal, The Deftones are cited at the top. Naturally, that does not add up to a whole lot, but did end up marking a particular sound amongst the generic haze with some personal style and production. White Pony suffers from it's mixture of half-baked, semi-experimental tracks, uninteresting, sludgy power-riffs, and self-absorbed vocals. With most of the album running by in a forgettable (though not dismissible) adolescent artsy angst, I am only reminded in the final stretch what happens when the band takes it's time (and to me sounds their best) to bring a splendidly recorded, time-lapsed decay to the process."
3,What the hell?,"This CD is okay. I like about half the songs on here. I mean, they are good, but I'm extremely disappointed after having this CD recommended as 'the best deftones CD'. I have to say that I researched it, and when I saw the video for 'Back to School', I thought, 'Wow, this is gonna be good, hard rock.' Nope. Not really. Not nearly as much screaming as I wanted, no really catchy riffs that I noticed, and the lyrics are just too damn creepy. I don't mind weird, as I've heard all of Around the Fur, but there's fine line between oddly melodic and freakishly weird, and for a lot of the songs on here, deftones leaps over it. It is pretty good, though, but listen to all the songs on their website (they let you listen to the whole album), and then decide if it's worth your money. I love passenger, feticetera, and back to school, and some of the parts on the other songs I like, so that's what gave it the three stars."
5,A Great CD,"This CD is great. Every song is good. Plus, this is the coolest enhanced CD I've ever seen. When, you put it into your computer, you get pictures, music, and games. It's awesome. You should definently buy this CD. You won't be disapointed."
4,and mass appeal for all.,"I like Deftones a lot, I just don't like that people associate them with such contemporates as Korn and all those other lame bands. I think this is a really good album that shifts bewteen light, lush, soft spoken music and vocals into harshly disorted screams and trasitions into harsh music scapes. don't expect to like this if you want a band to stay in one sort of zone, becuase this shifts often (even in a single song). And do not hate this if you think this is just another band like Korn, it isn't so shut up."
3,so so album by what was an above average band,"not even close to the landmark album ""Adrenaline"". While there is nothing horribly wrong with this cd, it seems to me Deftones have lost some of their rough edginess to become more acceptable. Who can blame them, Korn did the same thing."
4,"Fan from Dallas, Texas","The Deftones do it again. They successfully deliver an album with raw emotion. Although not as heavy as previous works, they lean toward another aspect of their creative and musical expression. If you are a new Deftones fan, this album is a good start, but explore the previous albums as well. Overall, I rate this as a must have album."
4,Kisss It,It is a definately good c.d. Worthy of your buyingness. It is a hard C.d. and is one of the best new Core C.d.s on the market right now.
3,A boring compromise,"Some may say: even one star is too much, cause we have only Elite on here. Forget Deftones and switch to Five Pointe O.Others may think: well, if you're really crazy about Elite, you may as well like Korea, and Passenger. Besides, there are two nice sleep pills on the cd: Change, and Digital Bath. Three stars would work, and you can also try Flaw.There are definitely those who would happily scream: that's just the best by Deftones. Do we have enough stars available to vote? There's nothing like Deftones at all.So, why don't we all get a compromise?"
2,The end of the deftones,"The first 2 cd's kicked ass! Looks like the deftones have slipped into KoRn's sell out category. Will the deftones be on puma commercials next? They are playing family values 2000, all the sell outs do."
2,EXTREMLY over rated alblum,The deftones are a decent band. I have always found them to bequite over rated. They constanitly have been called a korn knock offby some or this phenomical genius of a band by some. to me they are just another knock off of korn. I have been a fan of both bands for about 5 years now so iam not some (edit) who watches T.R.L. Adrenaline was a great alblum so was around the fur. This alblum is comparable with korn 1998 alblum follow the leader in that they are trying for radio suppourt. It's defaniatly not a limp bizkit record which is good. it does have a few good songs but it's just another sell out alblum
2,"Mediocre, at best...","Here I am writing this review AGAIN (wink wink) and I will ""keep my comments directed toward the content of the title."" (wink wink-again) So, here I am again, saying how average this album is. After Change and the rockin Back to School, I was totally psyched to buy it. However, I went back to borrow my sister's copy, and I'm glad I did. At first listen, a lot of tracks stand out: Back To School, Elite, Knife Party, Korea, Passenger, Change and Pink Maggit. However, after many listens, I usually go to Back to School then skip all the way to Passenger. Actually, BTS is a remix of Pink Maggit, but Pink Maggit is too long for its own good. Korea, Passenger (even though it includes vocals from the EXCELLENT Maynard Keenan) and Elite soon grow boring, and the other tracks are too slow. There's nothing spectacularly bad about White Pony, but it's average at best. It's been two weeks, and I can come to this quick conclusion-buy the friggin Back to School single."
5,The White Pony is One Ride You Definently Don't Want to Miss,"This is an excellent album. The Deftones use their ecclectic sound to its fullest on this album. Not one song on White Pony isn't good. But, I'd have to say that my favorites are ""Digital Bath"" and ""Knife Party"". In both songs, the Deftones show their softer side, with acoustic guitars and more use of electronic sounds. The lyrics are as smart and poetic as ever, and the music is still brutal. Don't pass up this album. If you like the older material by Deftones, especially Around the Fur, check out White Pony."
5,Masterpiece,"White Pony is an offering that shows a maturity added to the bands show of emotion, primal rage, and melody. Lyrically, a lot of the lyrics are quit vague, which can give a listener an actual opertunity to find a meaning to each song. This, the third offering from the band, is more melodic than the first two albums, but still offers the primal rage, and raw emotion. It shows more maturity in their writing, and composing. At the end of this amazing ride, only 2 questions.......What is in store for their next offering, and why not put out all their different acoustic versions of different songs????? An amazing offering, truly an album for any hard rock fan to own, along with Adrenaline, and Around the Fur"
4,I Didn't know alt-rock could be this sexy...,"This is a good album. My favorites are the slower songs, Digital Bath, Teenager, Changes. In these songs Chino's voice give off this synthetic warmth that just makes me wish there were a whole album of slow deftones ballads. Not that the faster songs are bad by any means. Feiteciera(sp?) is an amazing song, ditto for knife prty. Only song i really dislike is elite, way too loud, almost unlistenable. It's pretty much four minutes of wall to wall guitar noise and distorted screaming.But yeah, it's a good album. Word is Chino is working on a side project of ambient-type music, hope that's true. it would seriously make my year..."
3,An ok cd for the Deftones,This cd is ok but I like some of their older stuff and it is good cd to buy but if your are looking for something with an edge I suggest 311.
2,what happend?,"man, i just do not like this deftones cd, i am a big fan of the band too..and i just cant get loose to it..i do like the songs ""elite"" and ""passenger"" not the greatest cd in the world"
3,Not anything like the other cd's,This cd is mellow and soft. It's nothing like there other cd's. The 1st 2 cd's are for hardcore moshing this sounds like a mix of Dave Mathews Band and the smashing pumpkins cd -ADORE! If you listen to the lyrics its pretty cool. But if you want something for rocking out get one of there 1st cd's. This is music for falling asleep!
4,Back to School is sweet..but is it worth a whole CD??,"I LOVED White Pony.. In fact I had downloaded the album off of the 'net before it was release officially, and the promo had Back to School on there. I was upset it wasn't on the CD. NOW I understand. A marketing gimmick! Well, I will probably still buy it, just because I'm a die hard 'tones fan, but it stills seems like a crazy idea. If you don't own White Pony, buy this one. If you have it, I wouldn't bother."
4,different but still really good,"i am a huge fan of the deftones. and i did have some apprehension about this album. However, i bought it yesterday and it's really good. I'm not so sure if it's chino singing in the middle of Knife Party. If it is, it's amazing. collaboration with Maynard is made less exciting by boring music. vocal effect on track 3 will make you want to rip your eyes out (not in a good way) it's THAT irritating. Lyrics like ""Here's my new address: 664...oh i forget"" really made me worry when i first heard the internet bootleg version, but once again, deftones manage to rock. This album may take a little getting used to like Incubus' ""Make Yourself"" cus it is different. In my opinion, heavy fans will be dissappointed with tracks like ""digital bath"" and track 2, but feiticeira, street carp, and change, will remind fans of why they fell in love with the deftones a while ago."
3,Different Style,"This album is so different than their first two its hard to even compare them. Don't expect ripping tunes like Engine #9. I don't think this effort is all that good, but it really isn't my style."
3,Pony,I just brought this CD home from the store and after listening to it for three times I still have mixed feelings about it. Much more serene and quiet than their first two albums. There is no Blind or 7 Words on this one and overall I feel that something is lacking from the CD. If you do not yet own Adrenaline or Around the Fur you should buy those first but this is still a fairly good album though a bit disappointing from this band.
3,2lite is all i have 2 say,"I have loved rock/metal music for quite awhile and i thought I'd give this cd a try. so, i bought it and i liked it. it has a lot of light songs that i don't care for,like digital bath, rx queen and a few more that are like that. overall its a good structured cd and i would recomend it very much.I think the best song on it is Change(in the house of flies), the funniest song is Street Carp.if u like rock, the lighter stuff buy it if your into metal don't buy it(but u can if you want 2 expand your cd collection) i am a rock and metal fan and i think its ok."
4,evolving!!!!!!!!!!!1,"that's right! these guys are evolving along with their style,since adrenaline deftones started to make a softer sound to their following 2 albums....white pony is undoubtedly a masterpiece BUT chino must go back a little to his authentic metal roots .....right!?"
3,This cd is ok...,"This cd is ok ..I thought it would be better though. it's not as good as their older cd's.. My favourite songs on the album are street carp,change, korea and digital bath..."
5,Awesome Deftones CD!,"This is a very cool cd that I think every Deftones fan should have. It has some of the coolest beats and mixes and just rocks! Especially the song ""Change"". I love that song. Check it out."
3,Pop Rocks Candy,"the deftones 3rd studio album rocks... i'll admit that. but unfortunately, in their attempt to broaden their horizons a bit and expand on their musical talents sometimes results in a more generic pop-feely sound...granted, it's still loud and the strength of Chino's vocal chords still astounds me, but in general, the album sounds quite a bit more radio-friendly than their last two efforts."
4,Deftones' new cd is powerful,"The new Deftones cd, White Pony is powerful, heavy and deep. Their sound resembles Tools' and as a matter of fact Maynard James Keenan does some vocals in the song passenger. Also, their hit song Change is one of the best new songs this year. If you like Tool, A Perfect Circle, the Deftones of old, and/or their new song Change, then you'll love the cd."
4,white pony,Not as hard as the first two but I still love it. The songs seem to have a little more work put into them than the standard play and record and after you listen to the album a couple of times you will appreciate it and want to crank it up.
5,What They've Been Building Up To,"What can I say? I was blown away by this. Everything flowed together perfectly. I was afraid they'd lose something when I heard that this would be completely different from their old works. However, the complete opposite is true. They do something truly special here, mixing elements of their two previous works and yet doing something totally abstract from the previous albums.The album starts off well and only builds up from there. Each song is different, but coalesces with the others so that there is a definite flow. From the heavy Elite to the beautiful Teenager everything here comes together perfectly.It's hard to pick a favorite song, because I like each one, but I was especially pleased with Passenger, Digital Bath, and Knife Party."
2,Blah,"Probably one of the most repetitive, blandest albums I've heard. Plain vanilla. Nothin' special here."
2,Ouch,"The Deftones are one of those bands that I can respect for writing their own stuff and not worrying about popularity. Unfortunately, I cannot appreciate their music. All of their songs sound just about the same, and none of the musicians in the band are particularly talented. The lifeless, effects-heavy vocals are probably the worst part of the album: Chino seems to do little more than whisper in a very annoying tone or deliver a tiresome, emotionless scream that serves no purpose. This being said, the Deftones have managed to put out another generic sounding, bland metal album that is listenable, but by no means ""essential"" nor even all that interesting."
2,A BIG Dissapointment.,After 95's adrenaline and 97's around the fur. I was very excited for this album to come out. What a big dissapointment. All the songs seemed to be 4 minutes of noise. If you want to get a real deftones cd get around the fur. It is there best one.
2,I have a little problem with this CD...,"Just to let you know that despite the 2-star rating, I think this is a great CD, but if you're planning on getting it (which I highly recommend) you better do so after October 3rd, because 'Back To School' (Mini-Maggot) will be added to the CD. Unfortunately for the 500 000 who already bought this CD, you have to go through the tedious ordeal of going into the multimedia portion on your computer (it's an enhanced CD) and downloading the new song if you really want it. I'm glad that the band thought about those who already purchased it, but unfortunately, my computer is too slow and I can't access the multimedia portion of the CD, so I lose out. Go figure..."
5,Chino Man !!!!,"WWWWZZZZZUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPP CHINO !!!What do think of these bands,""Between The Burried and Me"" and, ""Glass casket"".If that is really you Chino, when is the new album coming out ?and when is the Team Sleep thing coming out ? You're awesome Man !"
3,It's OK.,"I'm into lots of styles of music, rock, punk, alt-metal, but I can't get into this album. I don't dislike it, I've just never really gotten excited about it, even after a few years. At the times when I think I could like it, I realize I'd just rather listen to something else. I don't think I like the way this guy sings/screams. I think they remind me too much of ""Staind"", who's better, and I don't even really like them. I do like the songs ""Change (in the house of flies)"", and ""Passenger"" though. I know some people probably worship this disc, but I'd rather listen to ""Tool"", ""Korn"", ""Rage"", etc."
4,Deftones best,"White Pony is the Deftones best, now with the awesome extra track ""back to school"" its even better. The reason I give it only 4 stars is a few songs sound the same. Not a big deal though.Heres what I rate the songs""Back To School:10 (awesome)feticera:7Digital Bath:9 (great)Elite:5RX Queen:8Streat Carp:8Teenager:6Knife Prty:8 (weird)Korea:10+ (the best song on the CD)Passenger:9Change:9Pink Maggit:5Im a fan of Korn,Bush,Nirvana,and some Limp bizkit (the non-rap stuff only)and I think the CD's great evrn if it isnt as heavy.Go buy it."
2,I saw this on TRL,"I love TRL and the kings of metal P.O.D. told me to vote for this and I did and it was cool. I bought the album and I put it on and it scared me. I was like ""hey they have heavy guitars like KoRn"" but the lyrics are scary. The song Knife Prty played and I almost stabbed my Micheal Jordan poster but then the song was over and I threw the knife out the window. Needless to say I don't listen to this album much but I like Ponies and Change in the house of flies is cool cause Carson likes it so I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Long live SR-71!!!!!"
4,its aiight,This cd was pretty good it is not as heavy as there other cds but it is still listenable. The best song is passenger because chino sings with maynard from tool. The robot is really rusty i need to put oil on him so he can move. two ninjas jump on my roof hey get down from there ninjas i dont want u on my roof
4,Sexy new feel to the deftones,"The Deftones previous albums were very rap and korn orientated. This album has many new ideas which have made this album. Chino, the front man of deftones wanted a more sexy feel to this album. This album has followed his idea with smooth flowing fast distorted riffs. It has more of a mellow feel to the songs. ""Elite"" is however an edgy song much like a more heavier song from before. The main differences with this album is the new ""evolved"" style within the band, seperating themselves even further from korn and limp bizkit."
4,limited edition cd is bettter,"This is such a great cd. I went out and got the very last copy of the black limited edition cd at my local best buy this morning. Its worth every cent. The cd is enhanced so its got a really spiffy program with pics, movies, and even a game. If you are willing to spend a couple of extra bucks and you're a die hard deftones fan, i think you should get the limited edition cd which comes in red or black...most of them are probably already gone, so if you're a deftones fan..i suggest you get it while its available!"
5,BEST CD,"An excellent cd. The songs range in emotion, from heavy to soft. There is a great contrast between a more sedated sound then, to songs like elite. Also, for anyone who likes Tool/APC, you'll love Passenger, which uses Maynard James Keenan's vocal talents. personally, i feel that this cd is as good as around the fur and adrenaline. if you don't have either of those, be sure to get them. my personal favorite songs are: street carp, elite, change (in the house of flies), and pink maggit back to school (also known as mini maggit)is ok, though pink maggit is betteri'd like to add Chino's comments on elite (it's full of metaphors, infinity 2)""this is laughing at everybody trying to become what they already are. if you want to be one of the elite, you are. im sort of the a**hole in the song, pretty much talking sh*t about everybody else. you're supposed to feel stupid after listening to it and wonder what it is to be elite."" - Chino"
2,something that could have used more work,"what the hell is this? since when are the deftones supposed to be soft? thats all that this cd is... it sorta irritates me to spend 12 bucks on a cd thats not all that great. the only things that i liked were: passenger and the pacman style game. if you are a real deftones fan you will like skinlab, chimaira, or pantera"
2,Dispointment,"This CD was definitely a disapointment. I like the song Change(in the House of Flies), but that is it. The rest of the album doesn't have anything to keep my interest. I have returned this to the store, because if I kept it I would have never listened to it again. Don't waste your money."
1,Deftones of what,The only interesting thing about this CD is the cover. After that it's pretty much generic modern-metal-rock. YAWN.
2,"Is this Nu-Metal?...not really, just boring","This CD is really nothing special. The songs aren't really that interesting, and the lyrics are almost meaningless. However compared to some other bands this is acceptable. If you like other Deftones CDs you might like this. The music on this CD is so bland you cant really come up with anything substantial to critisize."
1,Fabricated Sturm und Drang,"I don't mean to run counter to the herd, but most of the reviewers are giving the Deftones way too much credit. Chino Moreno's vocals are so gritty that they are unlistenable, and the lyrics are so contrived that I don't even think the thirteen year old weepy child of divorce that the Deftones are targetting could find them anything but laughable. The ""Back to School"" song is an excellent example of the way people who pretend to find high school an agony capitalize on it long after leaving; so sorry that plodding through the school system is so hard, Chino.The one slice of brilliance in this CD is the track ""Passenger"", which features Maynard James Keenan as many have noted. Sadly, I stomped this terrible album to pieces before discovering that.Oh well."
5,"Great,,,But Not as Good","The new Deftone's cd, White Pony is great but the other 2 cds were a little better. My favorite songs are street carp and pink magot. Even though its not as good as the other cds i would still suggest to buy it and see what you think. Im glad I got it. The band is a lot better than before because they got a new band member. Chino is just as good as before,, but the music isnt quit as enjoying to listen to."
4,"Not as hard as ""around the fur"", but....","...who gives a f**c, pony is still very good. Intensive, emotional and sh*t like that."
3,it sounds good but not as good as before,"out of the three deftones cd's that are out this is not one of the better ones. it is still good but just not as hard as some of there older stuff. If you want hard Deftones then get ""Around the Fur"" which is a better cd."
4,deftones white pony,i just finished listening to this cd and it left me wanting more.good songs a lil more melodic than the last but still the deftonesit sounds a lil more refined cleaner but is thatwhat i want from the deftones? they still have a lot of power. bottom line not as heavy but still a good cd.
4,This album was worth the wait,"I really like this album because the Deftones keep their same style as from their previous two. I think there are a lot of good songs. The first track is a great way to start a cd, and I liked pretty much all of them. The one that stands out is Knife Prty. That song is totally amazing. Now that the Deftones have a little more exposure and popularity, hopefully they won't pull a Limp Bizkit and change their sound. Next Chino will get onstage and sing with Christina Aquilera. God I hope not!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Heavy, yet beautiful","First off, don't say this CD isn't heavy. Just because the lyrics are more upbeat than usual on a few songs (Digital Bath, RX Queen, Passenger), that doesn't mean it's not as heavy.But at the same time, this CD is beautiful. The lyrics are touching, the guitar work is stunning, and Chino's voice---I can't even describe Chino's voice.The best songs on this CD are Back to School (I have the white version, but it seems more people read reviews for the standard silver version...), Feitceria, Digital Bath, RX Queen, Street Carp, Teenager, Knife Prty, Passenger, and Change.No matter how awesome Around the Fur was, because that CD is also a masterpiece, White Pony is that much better. Get this CD today."
3,Emotional and good!,"Deftones makes some rap-metal music...and obviously, I don't like that kind of music, but this is different. Chino Moreno's voice is beautiful and touching, unlike most rap-metal band's singers. Listening to this album gives you a warm shiver, you feel like being alone in a huge bubble. It makes me feel closer to myself. Strange isn't it? It's true though. The best songs are ""Change In the House of Flies"", ""Back to School"" and ""The Passenger"" which features Maynard James Keenan, the vocalist of Tool, and he has an awesome voice, and this song is great! Deftones is a world itself, and I go there when I need to feel alone. The only thing is that some songs are repetitive, but it's a good album overall. Pretty emotional but heavy at the same time...weird but great mix!"
5,GOood,"This CD is so amazing. Some people say Deftones are nu-metal or something. I'm into indie/emo stuff but I love this album! It's really simple and Chino's voice is so emotional and good. I really like songs like ""Digital Bath"" , ""Change"", ""Knife Prty"", and ""Back to School""."
3,a good buy,"to all those who like fred durst, and that type of music need to buy this cd. although it is not as good as deftones earlier album ""around the fur"". the cd is although definately i think all rock fans should buy."
3,if only every song was like digital bath,"This cd could have been truly phenomenal if every song was like digital bath, hands down the best song the deftones have ever recorded. One reason digital bath is such a great song is because chino sings rather than screams, and experiments with the extremes of his vocal range without making it sound vulgar. Another reason is the softer approach taken, as this song could harly be classified as heavy metal and as a result is much more satisfying than the rest of the material on this album. If the deftones are looking to take a new approach to thier music, songs like digital bath and teenager should be the direction they are looking to take. There are other good songs on this album, but the fact that digital bath blows them all away shows that the deftones should be striving for something more than simply this, because they are capable of it."
3,Every other song is good,"This album is disstressing. Love one song, hate the next, love the next, hate the next, etc... Stop it! Very frustrating listening to an album that way. Gosh, and the good songs are really good and the bad songs are really bad. How can they not notice this? I can't tell if I like 'em or hate 'em. A little bit of both. I'd recommend it, though, for the good songs, of course."
2,Not my type of ride,"I did not enjoy this album. Based on the triple digit number of reviews for it, I must concede I am in the minority. This is a chart topping hit. It is also well produced, and performed. No one should be ashamed for liking this CD. Maybe it's just me, but I found it to be boring. The sound is intense, as are the lyrics. However, it seems that variation is achieved through modulating tempo alone, and that plays out quickly. And yes, I did give the ENTIRE cd much more than one listen. If you like the first three songs, I would think that you will like the entire album. Regretably, I failed that test. If you are interested in intense, heavy music or are interested in what is currently popular, this CD might be interesting to you."
5,Pony's Rockin' it,"This is a classic deftones album. It has all the visceral bite the previous album did, yet it bathes each song on the album with an abstract melody that up until this point was unheard of from the masters of sonic emotion.Nowhere on the album is this more evident then on the second track digital bath. It has the ability to bring me to tears every time I hear it. It's so beautiful yet raw that it pulls you in two different directions threating to bring you to your knees (In a good way).I love this album and would recommend it to anyone who is sick of the same old schlock and wants something diffrent."
5,"Buy 'em all, people!","Every DEFTONES album ever made is worth the money. No filler here, people. There were 2 before this and one after with another on the way, and if you don't own them yet - GET THEM! You hear me? Don't steal them, don't 'borrow' them -- BUY THEM! This band is worth the money. Others may come and go, but Chino's voice will always be sexy."
5,Their best Ever,"This is the best Deftones album ever released. They were really at the top of there game here. They took numetal and made it both really heavy and slow and melodic at the same time. Chino can rap and scream better than any of those horrible numetal bands that exist now. Back to School (mini magit) and Pink Maggit both rocked my socks off as well as Passenger, Street Carp, and even the ballady Teenager. There isn;t a dud on this album. If you want to move away from hasbeen Korn and Limp Bizkit, pick up this good album!"
3,beauty is paint,"i really love these shoes, they have little star cut outs- and who doesn't want that at your feet?? my only complaint is the strange fit, i have no idea why the back raises up and then bends a little.. almost like it was intentionally made to give you blisters. it's tight too. aughh. :("
1,summon room,"I thought it was psychotic and morbid, with no social redeemable qualities. I purchased this compilation on line because I enjoy the spoken word. I didn't just throw it in the garbage, I broke it first."
5,Adventure with a Message,"Little Horse is a wonderful children's book about using ones own talents for the good of the community. With a handicap, Little Horse is able to use his strengths to save the herd from the encroachment of humans. It is a great story about focusing on our strengths. Filled with adventure, this book keeps you wondering what is going to happen around the next bend."
5,Great fun for playing fetch!,"These balls are just perfect for playing fetch with our cat. He absolutely loves them! They are bouncy enough to make chasing them fun, and small enough that he can pick them up to bring back to me."
1,Bad smelling,"Cat behavior varies, of course, but our cat took one whiff of these Sponge Balls and walked away, totally uninterested in having anything to do with them. They have an industrial chemical smell that probably takes awhile to off-gas. By comparison, our cat loves theHartz Pom Poms Cat Toy, which have no discernible odor."
5,Purr-fect Cat Balls :),"My cat is obsessed with these soft, spongey balls. They roll, bounce, and stick easily, so they are sort of ""interactive"" for the cat. She goes back to these over and over again, ignoring her traditional cat nip toys. Definitely worth the money. Would buy again."
1,Don't buy this. It's junk.,Bought this card and it has been nothing but trouble. Crashes on deep sleep and occasionally also causes my entire system to fail.The worst thing is Sonnet support just says don't use sleep. No they are not fixing or replacing my card because the problem is known and intermittent amongst buyers. And they don't mention it for that reason. Not good service or a good product.
5,"great pointer, but one complaint","I absolutely love this pointer, but the display shows a silver pointer with chrome accents, but I was sent a black one!! Maybe the retailers would accept a return of the black pointer and send me a silver one"
1,Save Your Money!,"I bought this yesterday and watched it and I'm returning it today. This was the biggest waste of money. Most unentertaining streetball dvd(s) ever. Anything from the And 1 series is definitely better. If you're into seeing ankle breakin' crossovers, tricks and passes don't get this. Granted there are a lot of dunks, but they could've put everything really on one DVD because there's only about 15 min of basketball footage total that just gets recycled over and over again. And the thing is that 15 min is so damn boring! It's like you could've made the same video yourself just going to your local spot where people ball."
2,does this product really work,I have used almost one bottle but I have not seen skin lifting result but it does give lots moisture which is not what I aim for....
2,Didn't see much of a different,"I didn't see any different, I used it every night untill it was finish. I would not buy this product again."
1,There is a better choice,"This ball is inferior to other products of the same size. The material is weaker and therefore if you are a bit heavier than average the ball does not maintain it's shape. That is to say taht you can not do situps as it becomes too ""flat"". I tried inflating it more until I could not inflate it any moer and it still flattens out when you sit on it. I previously purchased a 95cm ball by Physioball (like the one I had been using in Physical Therapy)and it did not flatten when sat upon. I had no problem with the ball (until the cat puntured it). I do NOT recomend this ball if you are overweight. Look for one which is a bit pricier as they seem to be made of a better (thicker perhaps) material. If I had the paper work I would return this ball!!"
3,Yodel in ten minutes,This book is in two parts. The first part by Rudy Robbins is five stars. The second part by Shirley Field is one star--hence three stars overall. The first part by Rudy has the phonetic and normal/falsetto patterns written down plus songs to match the patterns. You can yodel right away and sound pretty good in ten minutes. The second part has no phonetics or vocal patterns. It has musical notes. I can listen to Shirley and try to mimic and guess that high notes on the scale are falsetto but it's a guess. You learn by mimicry more or less; not helpful. If the second part--the advance lessons--had the phonetics and vocal patterns written down too it would make it easier. Buy it for the first part which is very helpful for beginners.
3,very nice but....,"spring broke, you can get a replacement spring from others but it is a hassle. others have had a spring problem as well but this one is no different. other than that a nice piece."
2,The sole came off,I wore this for about 9 months and the inside sole came off. I also rode a motorcycle while wearing this pair and the gear level rip off part of the upper sole. Overall quality is poor but the gel feels nice.
2,Grindingly boring,"Sharpe is living on his reputation with this one. I suggest you avoid buying it and read Porterhouse Blue or the Throwback to see Sharpe at his very best.Sorry Tom, but you need to keep your writing sharp!"
3,a humorous yet tiresome read...,"Okay, Sharpe does write funny material. The dialogue, complete with cute double entendres, is especially hilarious. And Grantchester Grind, a farce concerning the shenanigans at a stodgy old Cambridge (UK) college, has all that. The author makes great fun of both Americans (loud, vulgar, stupid) and British (snobbish, prudish, self-righteous). However after the first couple hundred pages it all starts to feel repetitive, as if the author doesn't know where to go with the story. In the end I was glad to be done with it!Bottom line: the author has written better. Not recommended."
4,Not too shabby,"I prefer Motion Man's second album to this one, but both are underground hip-hop classics. I still don't understand why Motion Man isn't more popular. He's one of the most talented and skilled rappers I've ever heard blessing the mic."
4,The Amazing Motion Man,"Motion Man does it again. The tracks are high quality brillant rhymes. If you like trashy radio rap avoid this album but if you like some real [stuff] then this is for you. If you've heard motion man then you should've already ordered this. If you haven't heard motion man then this will get you into him. Exceptionally incredible tracks include Hold Up (feat. Biz Markie), call da national guard, and the hidden track... Enjoy.Only 4 stars due to lame skit tracks that interrupt the vibe."
3,Could've been better!,"I've waited a long time for this CD to drop, ever since I heard Motion catch wreck on several Kool Keith albums. Now that I've heard the album I must say I'm a bit dissapointed. This dissapointment hasn't got anything to do with Motion, cause he drops some tight lyrics and flows on his first solo-project. It's his producer KutMaster Kurt that somehow slips up. Don't get me wrong he drops some ill beats on this project, actually all the beats are dope and fit Motion's style well. The problem is Kurt's sound gets too repetetive, because all the beats are produced in the same style (with exception of ""call the national guard pt.2"" and the hidden tack ""come hack this"", wich I think are the best tracks) and the album starts too get boring with it's large amount of tracks. If you like albums like GangStarr's ""Moment of Truth"" and Non Phixion's ""The Future Is Now"" I recommend this one to you, but if you're expecting this album to sound like anything from Kool Keith, don't buy it."
2,Eh!,"If you like the politically correct style WIP films of the '90s, then you will like this one too. It was too PC for me. Only saving grace was that it has some sapphic t&a. The film is very weak, otherwise. It fails as a drama. It's schmaltzy. Has little to no action, or violence. And scores almost a zero for subversiveness."
3,It's falling apart after half a day,"Beautiful dress, but already has a rip on the seam at the waist, and even worse...the fabric is ""running"" like pantyhose around the rip. So I'm at work and my dress is falling apart. Good thing I stuck jeans in the car to change into! I'm sure it can be repaired before tonight's party for one more wearing, but seriously, if I had paid $30 I'd expect this. Not expecting it on a $99 costume."
5,A Nice Costume,"I bought this costume to work in a haunted house. While expensive, it has proven durable and comfortable, and gets compliments. Most costumes seem to last a day or two, this one will last much longer. I am very happy with this buy and would recommend it."
3,Simply stunning,Very expensive for its quality from far you could tell is a costume.. the fabrics lok cheep but its beautiful .
5,5+ Stars!,"Teddy Pendergrass is great. He's got such a great, silky smooth baritone voice. I think more younger,up and coming recording artist should listen to the mastery that this man accomplishes in every single song that he sings. He has such a unique style that I haven't necessarily heard today's new R&B/ Soul male artists pick up on. Best songs include ""Turn Off The Lights"", ""Close The Door"", ""Love TKO"", ""Can't We Try"", ""Joy"", and all the rest of the songs on the CD! 5/5 stars and more stars if I could give more!"
4,Teddy Titilates,"Mmmmmm....Teddy puts the ""T"" in touching. Each song shows his soulful sexy way. He was around long before the imitators. These songs will make you smile. Get it today.Thanks--CDS"
5,A First Class Serving,"One of Gordon's lesser known albums, far more in the style of the time it was recored. More electric than accoustic,but still with the same depth of feelings and emotions as his later work.Vivaldi's Song, though not written by him recives the same depth of feeling as one of his own.Castels in the sky, asks us why we feel compelled to do as others say.Breathing In, is one of those song you will find yourself singing time and time again.Whisky, takes us back to a place we have all been at sometime in our lifeThis is a beautiful album made up of a collection of wonderfull love songs. So with a bottle in one hand and your loved one in the other, snuggle on the sofa and enjoy."
2,Cheap & Don't Buy,"When my this shipment arrived and I opened it, the color of product is ugly. I thought it may be the color only, but product will work fine(wishful thinking). Once I used this flapper,still I can see water dripping in toilet bowl. It doesn't fit nicely in the toilet tank. I should have bought BRAND NAME product. Well lesson learn on my part"
1,Dud,"OK- for basic techniques like rolling paper beads, but really falls flat on design inspiration. Instructions are sound, but the designs are what you might expect from a child's summer camp activities. There's not one piece in the book that I would consider wearable by an adult. Some, like the papier mache fish pins, are flat out embarrassing. The woven paper bracelets might be fun for tweens."
3,Not the best,"The mask isn't thick enough to block sunlight coming in through the window, it fits poorly, and it falls off easily. It's better than nothing though,"
2,Uncomfortable edging,"This sleep mask is nice and silky as the others reviewers say. However, I am surprised no one mentioned that it has a ropey edging to it, making it uncomfortable if you lie on your side. I tried it last night and it was both uncomfortable while I tried to sleep in it since it dug into my cheek and would definitely leave a mark when I got up. I would not recommend it."
2,falling apart,"It worked great for a couple months, but one of the elastic straps broke and the other one is breaking. I probably use it no more that two or three hours a week when my roomie is getting ready for work. Would not hold up for very long if you plan on sleeping with it every night."
3,Won't stay on,"This mask does a great job of blocking out light, and it is super soft and silky, but it does not stay on! I wake up most mornings with the mask having fallen off."
4,Desperation of the homeless,Steve highlights the plight of the homeless and the unknown on the streets where we all live. Nice going good book.
4,The best of the last,"This CD is a compilation of Lennon's solo career. I'm a Beatles fan and I've always thought that the evolution of Lennon in the 70's wasn't exactly the best. This CD is a testimony of that period of time in Lennon's life. Being a Macca fan also made me a little critical about Lennon, but if you are a 'new' fan (let's say a '1' fan) you'd better buy some Beatles CD's first (Rubber Soul, Revolver). Then you can buy this and maybe Wingspan. But don't try to listen to Lennon music without understand his previous music. For me it's the right way to enjoy for example 'Watching the wheels', a song that is -in my opinion- great song in the proper context, almost like all the others songs in this CD, with the exception of 'Jealous Guy', 'Woman' and of course 'Imagine'."
5,Cold Turkey has got meeeeeeeeeeeee!,"Man ""Cold Turkey"" is incredible. That song alone is worth getting this album. John Lennon was one of the greatest songwriters ever! This album is definitely the best for solo John Lennon material."
3,A waste of money for anyone who own the Lennon Collection CD,"For those of you who have Lennon collection album, this album will be very identical... So why should waste your money and buy this album if you already have the John Lennon Collection? It is the compilation of the John's best song but this album is nothing new. There is no new songs that will make this album to be different from John Lennon Collection CD. In my opinion, this album is bad album because whoever try to make this album want to exploit our money and John Lennon fame.. To reissue the Compilation of John works under different name and make it look new, to me, is a deceptive business practice..."
4,Not much Lennon left so buy,"Pretty much come to the bottom of the Lennon barrel....if have to get one thing to show todays ""music' lovers,this is it..."
5,Start Here,"The contribution John Lennon made to Rock and Roll music can never be measured.. Where would one start? Founding the BEATLES.. Being the BEATLES creative and intellectuial conscience..Being the BEATLES greatest Rock and Roller and slyist verbal Wit.. Leading the PEACE protests of the 60's..Writing and recording some of Rocks most memorable music after the demise of the BEATLES.. These are but a few things for which John Lennon will always be remembered.. So if you would like to find out more about John Lennon and what all the fuss is about him ,buy one of the many Books written about him.. Watch one of the many movies done of his life..Or if you choose to purchase this fine CD, ""LENNON LEGEND"", it is a very good starting point to begin an appreciation of John Lennon's music..With timeless songs such as, IMAGINE,INSTANT KARMA,COLD TURKEY,GIVE PEACE A CHANCE,WOMAN,WATCHING THE WHEELS and NOBODY TOLD ME, you should not be dissappointed..So start here.."
5,It really is the best of John Lennon,"This CD compilation contains just about all of the ebst songs John Lennon ever did. If you want the most complete selection of his solo hits, this is the CD to get."
3,john lennon legend,"Nothing will top the John Lennon compilation from the early 1990s,which was a 4 cd set called John Lennon!!!!"
5,its a great cd,all ican say is that as a whole its a great cd many good tunes the price was good am very happy many hours of enjoying the songs
3,Overrated.,"I don't want to be the one to rain on anybody's parade, but except for a few songs (Imagine, Instant Karma, Happy Xmas) this CD is subpar. I expected it to be great because I like some of his solo work and later work with the beatles, but I thought that all of his songs would be like Imagine. I warn you not to make this mistake...if you're willing to buy the album for these few songs, then do so, but otherwise, don't encourage Yoko and help her to continue her lavish lifestyle. All the money goes to her and Shawn, you know, none to Julian, and I think that really sucks. If just for that, don't buy anything more from John Lennon...that's my advice!"
3,Not his best!,"The John Lennon ""Imagine"" soundtrack is a much better collection of songs than this CD. It includes more of his work with The Beatles . How could any Lennon hits package not include ""Strawberry Fields""? That song is just simply one of his best songs ever written!"
3,"Obviously a great compilation, but i have a suggestion...","While the songs on this album are obviously great, hence, a greatest hits album, i think that one would be better off buying an album which was actually artistically aranged by John Lennon. A good album to start out on would be ""Imagine,"" or ""Plastic Ono Band"". These albums actually allow you to experience the music the way that it was originally intended to be heard, not just a somewhat random compilation of hits. In my case, I bought this album first, became obsessed w/ John Lennon, and than I bought other Lennon albums, making this purchase totally worthless. My only warning is, for Lennon beginners, dont purchase something like ""Two Virgins,"" The wedding album,"" or ""Life with the Lions."" If you purchase a ""sound collage"" album first, your odds of liking John Lennon are about as good as the chances of Marilyn Manson opening a day care."
2,the cd was scratched,the cd was not y good condition wen the CD arrive i put that in my radio and what a surprIse the music bump
4,sweet,"this is a pretty good review of john lennon's solo recording career. although if they were to take off ""Mother"" and put on ""Remember"" i would be much more satisfied. Plus maybe take replace ""Borrowed Time"" with ""Isolation"". butts, its pretty good. I listen to it quite a bit."
5,Lovely album,"Goodness gracious. I'm sensing alot of hostility in the reviews about John as a person or musician or whatever. Look people, no one's putting him on a pedestal..at least, I'm not, but you can't deny his talent. Ever heard the saying ""If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all""?. Please apply that. Most of you that are saying such rude things were crappin' your diapers when they were making the whole world sing. The guy's not here to defend himself and that's just low-down dirty. Have some respect."
5,Great songwriting,"John Lennon was a genius not only for his songwriting but for what he done in the 70s-80s. All John wanted was peace and he got it, he didnt want fights or wars or anything like that. John Lennon was a pure genius at the things he done before his death in 1980. John Lennon is one of the world's best singer or person in that fact. If you liked The Beatles, you will love John Lennon at his finest works."
4,"Everything You'd Want, and Then Some","I'm not a huge Lennon (solo)fan, but he did turn out 6-7 indespensible songs in his post-Beatle career. This collection has them all, plus a lot more."
3,Lennon's Solo Best,"While I prefer his Beatles songs, this CD has some of Lennon's best solo tunes including:""Imagine""""Instant Karma!"" (my favorite here)""Cold Turkey""""#9 Dream""""Stand By Me""""Just Like Starting Over""""Watching The Wheels""""Nobody Told Me""""Give Peace A Chance"""
5,The Ambassador,"John was the quintessential Beatle - an Ambassador to world peace, great songwriter, singer and lyricist. Tragically, he died way before his time. I always wondered what he would have accomplished had he lived longer. A must have for any music collection. Instant Karma, as always, remains an inspirational piece with transendant lyrics and Nobody Told Me is a piercing evaluation of modern times. Probably his best lyrical composition. Mind Games and Give Peace A Chance are classic Lennon songs - outward, communal and insightful. No wonder the Beatles were so good."
4,Needless to say!,"Why the review is my question, i mean, like the title says hes a legend, everyone knows the tracks, its just good to have all the best on one CD. The only thing i have to say about John Lennons music is how good it is to see someone who writes there feelings rather than a load of nonesense thought up in the pub. Druged up maybe but feelings they were!"
4,Excellent collection,"Almost every song belongs to the best of Lennon. But I don't like the Chritmas song, just don't fit the mood of the album."
5,Great Music,"This is a great cd with 20 songs but its missing ""im losing you"". Why they omitted that song ill never understand. It is though on the john lennon collection. The sound quality is terrific. John lennons music is timeless."
5,"Lennon, a great artist and a great man.","Outstanding words and music from the Man who made us all think about the finer things in life. I also recommend ""Across the Universe"", on DVD, for all you diehard Lennon fans. Great story and music. Thanks very much. Ron Caylor"
4,pretty good intro. to john's solo work,"i wish it had more tracks off of plastic ono band but this is a good introduction to john's solo projects.i really like the songs instant karma, imagine, watching the wheels, and jealous guy. the others are good too."
2,Overrated.,"Seriously, do ""Give Peace a Chance,"" ""Nobody Told Me,"" ""Instant Karma,"" ""Imagine,"" ""Mother,"" and ""Working Class Hero"" strike anyone as good music? My understanding is that in the mid-'60s, Dylan asked Lennon why the Beatles' songs didn't say anything. There followed a spate of limousine liberal songs of the most predictable type, and they're mostly very boring; not only did Lennon fall into the typical rock star trap of having to ""prove himself"" by going solo, but he also had to try to ape Dylan's inspired protest songs. ""Girl"" is about as witty as he got, and the rest is sheer pretension. ""God"" and ""Imagine,"" for example, might have seemed deep if the man had been 13; for a grown mega-star, though, they are the most childish of ruminations. What junk. Why not spend the money on a good volume of Dostoyevsky -- and avoid the lousy, clunky music, to boot? -- Former owner of 69 Beatles and post-Beatles recordings by the four lads from Liverpool."
1,Just another compilation...,Just another compilation trying to cash in over the great John Lennon.Sad.
2,This is the best of John yah right.,"I have gotten this cd becasue there was a time when i listen to the beatles all the time. At the time i listen to classic beatles cds like rubber and such but i rarely listen to this cd. Actually i liked George Harrison's last cd better. There are good songs on this like imagine but that has been played to death. I like the song mother becasue it is very personal. I also like jealous guy but Roxy music did a better version of it anyway. Why do people keep critizing paul for doing senitimental sap John has done his fair share of it and alot of it is on this cd. Songs like dream 9, beautiful boy, just like starting over are sappy. Even Someone as bad as celine dion covered beautiful boy. Another thing about john was he did not have much of a voice it was not bad but it also was nothing to write home about."
5,Watching The Wheels.,"For those who don't want to buy all of Lennon's solo cds, this is all you need. Less lengthy than his box set, this single disc compilation has all his hits and non-hits, digitally remastered. Classics like ""Imagine"", ""Give Peace A Chance"", ""Woman"", ""Working Class Hero"", ""Mother"", ""Cold Turkey"", ""Watching The Wheels"", ""Nobody Told Me"", ""Borrowed Time"", ""Beautiful Boy"" and ""Love"" plus more. If you want the complete overview, buy his boxed set, if you have less time and money, this will do nicely in any rock collection. A must have for any rock collector."
3,A nice introduction to the Genius of John Lennon.,But eventually you will need to buy his albums if you want to really experience Lennon. This compilation just doesn't quite do justice. One thing that I was disappointed about is that the Sometime in New York album was completely left off.
3,Quite good but could be better......,"It is one of those rare Lennon collection albums with a comprehensive body of his work from 'Plastic Ono Band' to 'Milk and Honey', which is good, but sadly I think some of his best work, 'Woman', 'Starting Over', 'Nobody Told Me' was towards the end, true he did some classics at the start of the seventies and I wouldn't knock that but 1980 showed that Lennon was entering a new musical phase and attitude which was sadly uncompleted."
5,"Explicit i don't think so, only one song comes to mind","I can't believe what I'm reading on the screen here John Lennon legend album Explicit? Hmm well I don't think so, only one song that comes to mind where that tag should be put, Working Class Hero. Other than that, I have no idea why some bonehead decided to label all these wonderful songs with that label that aren't filthy, call it pure stupidity. All the other songs on here are worry free for hrs of enjoyment. The sound is crisp and clean just a wonderful greatest hits album for any new or old Beatles or classic rock fan.Highly Recommended"
4,"Lots of great songs,","and two or three that are not. This is the most complete collection of Lennon's solo work I've heard. Lennon reminds me of the old poem about the little girl with the curl in the middle of her head. When he was good, he was very, very, good (""Imagine""), when he was bad, he was horrid (the primal scream stuff he did with Yoko, which fortunately isn't included here)."
5,Must have for Brad Paisley Fans,This CD is great. I highly recommend purchasing it. This is a lot of fun to listen to.
2,Not nearly as good as previous cds,"This whole cd is bland compared to the previous releases. There just aren't as many great guitar licks and the mixing doesn't sound as good to me. On top of that, they lyrics are clever but too racy for my younger children."
2,His earlier CDs are better.,"I guess 'Ticks' should have tipped me off, but the material on this CD just isn't as good as his previous CDs. Other than the Carrie Underwood duet, I don't really care for any of the songs."
3,"Some good, well known songs - but a lot of lesser known ones too","This album is fine. I like Brad Paisley's voice, so had purchased this several years ago. There are some good, well-known songs on this CD - but a lot of lesser known ones too. I'm listening to less country music now, so I'm not sure if I'd purchase this album again, but I did enjoy some of the songs."
5,"Clever, Cute, CREATIVE!!","First - not typical trucks, drunken break-ups, sex-filled derogatory-ness!I LOVED the ""sneakiness"" displayed in ""Ticks"" - - ;>)Brad Paisley! You ROCK! aaaaaaand your Grandfather would be VERY tickled for you, Kim & Huck - - -I thank God for you & your freshness!JJ"
3,not my favorite,"I love Brad Paisley. I think he's an amazing country singer because he has the voice and talent, and he sings about things that just really seem to fit his personality. I loved this CD for ""Online"", ""It Did"", ""Ticks"", ""I'm Still a Guy"", and ""Letter to Me"". Unfortunately, the rest of the songs didn't really spark any interest in me. Overall, a good CD, but I prefer his others to this one."
5,Just Great!,"Not only did this CD have the exact songs that I was looking for, but ones that I hadn't heard yet and just love. Brad Paisley fans will not be disappointed with this one."
5,Buy It!,"As normal, Brad cranks out happy American patriotic funny tunes. I wish I could just begin to play the guitar like him. Not a bad song on the album. Its an oldie but goodie:-)"
5,Top Gear,"Just when you think he can't get better, Paisley surpasses your expectations. There is no song on this album which would not be a hit single. The power and subtlety of his guitar work and the charming corniness of his humor have only improved. It is impossible not to salute the relentless pursuit of perfection, especially when it is combined with humor and humility."
5,Just Brad,"I suspect the reviewer who gave the album one star doesn't know what he's talking about!5th Gear is just Brad. It's a Brad Paisley record, it's fun, serious, romantic and sweet and all in a perfectly shaped package. The only big disappointment is that there was nothing to match ""She's Everything"" from Time Well Wasted, but all in all, an amazing album, and deserves one of my album of the year accolades."
5,"love it, love it, love it!!!!","I recently purchased this cd because I heard and loved the clever tune ""Ticks"" Now that I have it I love every song on it the guitar work is incredible and the lyrics are great. I actually went through all of his CD's and realized I am a Brad Paisley fan and just purchased all the others."
3,Good Country Sound,This is a good album of solid classic style country music. I hadn't tried any music by this artist and bought the album without any preconceived notions about it. It's enjoyable.
3,"I Didn't Enjoy 5th Gear as Much as ""Time Well Wasted""","I love Brad Paisley but didn't enjoy 5th Gear as much as I thought I would. I couldn't wait for the cd's release although I didn't enjoy the single ""Ticks."" I also did not like the single ""Online"" although I love ""Letter to Me."" I guess that's the problem with this album; its very hit or miss and I was expecting more from the lyrical content. I enjoy every other song it seems like and thus, I see this album as being average. While Brad's vocie is great to listen to, I need more than that and don't think this album stands up to ""Time Well Wasted"" or ""Mud on the Tires."""
3,Brad Paisley 5th Gear,Again I will admit that my wife is the bigger fan of Country Music. I like Brad Paisley and enjoy his music. We purchased a cd with his Christmas recordings and it is great cd to listen to and enjoy. He has alot of fun with his peers and contemporaries. Give him a chance and listen to this CD if haven't already. You might just like his voice and style.
5,still shifting gears,"This is a fantastic CD - in true Brad Paisley fashion! A great variety of fun, up tempo songs like ""Ticks"" mixed with touching ballads like ""Letter to Me"", and signature Paisley humor, like ""Online."" I bought this CD when it was first released and I recently went out and bought my 2nd copy - of the new version with ""Waitin' on a Woman"" on it. That was one of my favorite songs on the TWW CD and I am so happy that Brad went back to that song and released it!!! Made a great CD even better! Way to go Brad!!!!"
3,Decent computer,"It's not as fast as a P4, but it's a good system, and it's pretty cute. My main complaint is the weak graphics. I mean for 3 grand you think they could do better than a 64MB video card? You can hardly find a game that can run on that little video ram. It would also be nice if Apple could come up with a faster CPU. Frankly I buy them for the looks."
1,Softimage and other top companies drop mac os!,Apple has lost the battle and the war to Linux and Widows.
2,"Good, but not as powerful as a PC","OK, I feel I need to let all of you out there in on some information. MacWorld Magazines recently conducted a test pitting the G5 2GHz against an Athlon FX-51 and a Pentium 4 EE and the poor Mac was blown out of the water. The PCI-X in this machine is good for the future, and of course 8x AGP. Could be bundled with a better video card."
1,CHEAPER ELSEWHERE,"I LOVE this CD, however the price is offensive. I just bought a copy on ioffer for $15.90 including shipping. Thought people might want to know about that!"
2,Thin and cheap,"You get what you pay for here. The skillets are very cheaply made, very light and don't last long. You're better off buying $2.99 pans at Walmart."
4,No-stick and easy clean-up...,"just as advertised (although it's usually someone else that does the cleaning up, but I HEAR that it's easy)."
1,Deceived.,"I ordered the three pack ""First Course"" set, supposedly a heavyweight Farberware product as I've seen in stores. I received a light weight, flimsy product called ""Cook'n Ease"" that was so thin you could easily burn food and warp the pan in no time. Very disappointed."
3,Real basic,"Very lightweight, I don't know if that is good or bad. Judging the product based on its appearance I expected more. My empty 12 cup coffee maker weighs more than these three pans combined.They do let you cook in them without anything sticking. Simply put, you get three basic fry pans to use without fear of losing major income if they get ruined. As with most nonstick, don't use high heat as the manufacturer indicates."
1,Don't Bother! These pans are not worth a penny,Very thin..handles get very hot... coating was bubbling and flaking off after the first grilled cheese sandwich. I paid under 3$ after a rebate... and you get what you pay for. These shouldn't have the farberware name on them. they are to good a brand to put out such a shabby product.
4,Very affordable,"It seemed that I was always needing another nonstick pan. So, I bought this set. The aluminum is thin, the pans are shallow, and lightweight, but they work well enough and are easy to clean. I can cook a lot of breakfast bacon or home fries in the the large pan. It is too big for my large coil burner and any lids that I have, yet with a little attention everything cooks nicely. The metal handles will get hot close to the pan so I hold on to the ends. Great deal for the money."
2,not flat!,"Unfortunately needed a large flat bottomed non-stick pan to cook in fort the holidays. Well, I whipped out my new large pan and it would not set flat on my stove top. I almost got my meat mallet to pound in the bump in the middle of the pan, but went to the smaller one and had more success with that one. What you get is what you paid for, I guess. Farberware - you can do better than this!"
1,Kgaul,"The large skillet was mis-shapen, the eggs stuck to the pan, they are extremely light weight, pan height is very shallow. These are not worth purchasing."
1,These pans warp....,"These are cheaper pans as everyone has said, but I want to explain why I think so.When I cooked with them on a higher heat, they warped. They can't go back now. Even if I only use them on medium or lower, they are warped for good. :(Also, the non stick coating seemed to have come off after a few washes, and its on but things stick to it a lot more now. I'm ready to toss these and I haven't even had them that long.You're better off spending a little more and getting something you can use a lot longer!"
1,Absolutely worthless!,Don't be fooled by the photographs! They are light (not suitable for electrical stoves); they are extremely cheaply made; they bend easily in high heat; the non-stick surface is for laughs; and they have very short lifespan. Spend the same amount and get one pan but of better quality.
1,cheap starter set,"Just way too lightweight for any amount of serious cooking. Within a month of daily use at low to moderate heat (say 4-5 on scale of 1-10) the pans began to warp so badly as to be quickly worthless. I've already thrown away both of the bigger skillets and I only use the small one for applications at very low heat. If you're into any kind of even quasi serious cooking, buy something else."
1,Bad product,"These pans are very thin even compared with other cheap cookware sets. They are smaller than the stated dimensions so my lids don't fit. There is lots of good, cheap, non-stick cookware out there; you don't have to buy these."
4,Had for several yrs now...still good!,"For the price, they're still in good shape, even though I've had them a few yrs. One is just now starting to peel a little. But considering what I paid, not a bad deal."
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!","The pans are not Farberware quality. Cheap handles, Cheap nonstick material, and Cheap price. The price is right, but the quality is poor. Not a bad pan for the price. If you want a good Farberware pan spend a little more and get better quality."
5,WW II,"James Garner is good in this world war two flix. A good story about a commander who is ""by the book"" but for some reason not clear in the movie the commander forgets the book when the character of James Garner comes into play."
4,Even in black&white its great,"I'll be frank. ""DOWN Periscope""Down Periscopeis one of my favorite movies. After watching it for maybe the eighth or ninth time I remembered its name was a parody of the earlier ""UP Periscope"". And even in BxW James Garner gives a performance that reminds you he wasn't only a TV series actor. The cast who play the submarine crew amplify that great performance. Great suspense movies DID exist before high tech -- this film is proof."
4,Editorial Reviewer has it wrong.,"The Editorial Reviewer, Robert Horton, has it wrong about Alan Hale. The reviewer confuses Alan Hale, Sr. with Alan Hale, Jr. Alan Hale, Sr. appeared in Destination Tokyo (1943). Alan Hale, Jr. appears in this movie, Up Periscope (1959). Alan Hale, Sr. was Errol Flynn's friend and appeared in many of his films. Alan Hale, Jr. is best remembered for his role as ""the Skipper"" in Gilligan's Island. You would think that Robert Horton, the Editorial Reviewer, could at least get his facts correct."
3,Steady as She Goes,"James Garner plays the role of a demolition/diving expert sent on a secret mission in Japanese held territory during WWII. His method of transport to his mission target is a U.S. submarine whose commander is feeling insecure having just returned to port with an injured seaman who dies in hospital. The film has two main plots: one deals with Garner attempting to successfully complete his mission, and the other centres around how far the submarine commander is willing to go to assist Garner in completing his mission, without putting at risk the submarine and its crew.The acting was fine but I found the storyline fairly routine and this review is from someone who enjoys a good war movie, action or not."
3,OK,"As an old diesel submarine officer collecting old diesel submarine movies, I enjoyed this one I had missed."
4,"Good, but not great","A good production - I was especially impressed with the sets of the sub's interiorThe young James Garner's acting was pretty good - but he had room to improve.(As he did, obviously)I bought this to add to my James Garner collection - I'll probably watch it every couple of years, but probably not more frequently."
4,ALAN HALE WHO?,"Robert Horton is mistaken. Alan Hale Jr. was not in Destination Tokyo, That was his father Alan Hale Senior."
3,UP PERISCOPE,UP PERISCOPE IS A TOP NOTCH WORLD WAR II FILM STARRING JAMES GARNER & EDMOND O'BRIEN. WELL WORTH WATCHING. A TRUE FIND IF YOUR A WAR MOVIE BUFF LIKE ME.
4,An Underrated Submarine Film,"Up Periscope is a a World War II film with James Garner. Garner's mission is to infiltrate a Japanese held island to get a secret code book. He's under a lot of pressure and the submarine commander, a tough Edmond O'Brien, is a no nonsense commander. Garner is going in - alone - and unsure whether or not O'Brien is going to wait for him past his deadline. You can see why Garner became a movie star. His dashing good lucks and onscreen presence is strong. In addition, there are a few film stalwarts among the crew such as Alan Hale Jr. and a young Warren Oates."
4,Good little tale...,"Pretty pedestrian as war-flicks go, but a nice way to spend a couple of hours. Well acted, with good video scenery. This is the usual story about sneakiness, secrecy and stealth, with a twist of a little upheaval of authority and disunity of command. The suspense comes it while Garner sneaks into enemy territory underwater and is delayed returning to the waiting submarine - a submarine commanded by a by-the-book skipper who has little tolerance for special operations and vowed to leave Garner behind if he isn't back at the sub on time. Overall, a pretty enjoyable flick."
4,Good Sunday Afternoon Movie,"Great movie for a Sunday afternoon. James Garner's acting is what you would expect from an excellant actor. The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.) was also a pleasure, even though he plays a fun loving Officer."
5,"A real ""Killer""!","This is the first of these re-issues I have bought....just for that elusive ""Squid/Octopus"" bonus track!The sound is pretty good ,still some hiss in the tapes, but the bass is very nice and punchy!But the real Killer is ""Squid / Octopus""! This is one deranged(in a great ,""mad"" way)track. It's full of wild ,on the edge,dissonance,and imagery in the lyric which is way out in the ""acid"" zone(Acid Prog?)! It's been a long time for me to finally hear this fabled track,....It is worth all the pennies! The producers let the tape run out after the session so you can hear someone just go wild at the end in the studio about this mad ,hot take! This COOKS!!!Buy it for this track!"
5,SATISFIED ONCE AGAIN,Thank you! We've been begging for some sort of PJ fix for months!! My friends and I saw PJ twice Summer of '98. We even drove over 20 hours through tornados to prove how faithful of fans we are! This video is exactly what we needed to stay home safely and still enjoy the genious works of Ed and the rest of the guys! Along with this amazing video everything PJ produces helps us get through the day!!...Waiting for more...Please...
3,Good but could have been better. . .,"I really thought this video would be great. . . but it wasn't. It could have been a little longer and covered more depth about the band. Overall, it was interesting, but nothing special."
5,Good Movie For Big Fans or Musicians Who like Pearl Jam,"Over all it was a very good video for me, a long time fan. I wouldn't recpmmend it to anyone who hasn't followed Pearl Jam from the start but if your in to music and Pearl Jam's evolution this is the video for you."
5,"Good product, fair price.",This is usually what you'll need if you're restoring an old 10 speed and giving it a new road bike or fixie style saddle. Usually fits the existing seatpost too. Opens up a lot of possibilities for saddles.
3,A poem for the expendable,"I found this book to be a melancholy poem to the expendable, in this case the great artist Maria Callas. Callas is gone and Verdi and Bellini live on, and there will always be others to sing their music. No one will ever sing them like La Callas. I already knew that, but I didn't really know or realize the dizzy spiral that was Callas celebrity and social life. It was a change to read an account of this woman that seemed a bit irreverant, yet respectful of her immense talent. She certainly had her vocal flaws, and the author seems to lay them out with no apologies. I think I like her a little better now that I have seen her, warts and all. Thank God she didn't write her own memoirs. Most celebrated singers and their syncophants put down some really boring stuff. This was a breath of fresh air, rather than the ususal litany of virtues.Alvaro in St. Cloud"
5,fructose product,This company has a good quality fructose product that is very good quality. The delivery was as scheduled and the quality was very good. I think any user would be pleased with the quality of this fructose.
2,Incomplete directions hamper completion of projects!,"The directions on many of the projects are incomplete. For instance, they tell you to roll a spiral that's a certain number of inches in length when completed, but not how much wire it takes to make such a spiral. Through trial & error and wasting much wire, you can figure it out, but a how-to book should include all the details. And the clasps they tell you to make are ugly and weak.The book is basically a sales pitch for their brand of wire-wrapping tools & equipment (which I do own)--if you don't already have their jig & twist-n-tool, you'll have to shell out about $25 more dollars to get them before doing any of these projects.I found ""All Wired Up"" to be a far superior book: ISBN 188301073X"
5,My cat goes crazy for this food!,"My MC like-d only one brand of cat food prior to bringing this food home for her. SHE LOVES THIS FOOD!! We just got a 2nd Maine coon, and the breeder suggested this food... Not sure what is in it, but she goes crazy for this food. She is a smaller Maine Coon, so it will be interesting to see if she begins to fill out a bit on this food. It is pricey, but overall worth the $ as she's eating more and her coat after 2 weeks is already looking fuller and prettier! The kibble is bigger, but she is able to handle it and doesn't seem to mind the size. Definatly worth a try if you have a Maine coon."
1,Yeah they like it because it is just junk food.,"After feeding this cereal to my Maine coon who was 6, for only 8 months, he died of bladder stones. URI After his tragic death, I decided to research what caused his demise.l I found that dry cat foods are in now way suitable for any cat because of plant based proteins, not animal based. Cats can't digest plants they are carnivores. high usage of grains, high levels of carbs and of course no water. Do Yourself a favor and feed only wet food to your cat. This stuff or any dry food is nothing more than meat flavored cereal, made the same way as Capetian Crunch. If you don't beleive my review, do your own research. My other cat who is just a year will only eat wet food now which is low in all the bad stuff and roughly 75% water. Hydration in cats is everything."
3,Some good stories,"Some really good stories and some rather confusing stories. If you're a James Tiptree, Jr. fan, of course, you must read."
5,This Book Saved My Back,"I had chronic back pain for 13 years. Sometimes to the point of not being able to walk. After many years, I could ""manage it"" to a point but was often limited in what I could do actively. I kept asking my Chiropractor if there was anything I could do on my own to save my back and he always said no.After being fed up with going to the chiropractor over and over and not getting better, I was convinced that there must be a way I could help myself. I found this book and another one. The first one did not really help. Then ""Cure Back Pain with Yoga"" arrived in my mailbox.The next morning, I tried some of the exercises in the book. Then I ran about six miles without any pain whatsoever! I never see the Chiropractor anymore. I now have a great sense of when I have back pain what is the cause and how to fix it - a huge freedom. I run every morning and I have this book to thank for being able to do so.To anyone with back problems, I recommend this book full heartedly."
5,"Excellent, effective book","Both these authors know what they're talking about, and provide advice on using yoga to alleviate or end many types of back pain that you're unlikely to find elsewhere."
1,Bad advice,This book has some really bad stuff in it. It has lots of back bending/arching exercises for lumbar stenosis which is just wrong. Try Back Care Basics by Mary Pullig Schatz. It is based on science and the expertise and wisdom of B.K.S. Iyengar.
4,Milwaukee cut off saw,"Well improved design. I used to have the older model but the ""D"" handle and cast plate are much better to work with. The clamp is also a good improvement. I put it a notch above the De Walt."
3,Suge Knight shot me !,"The interviews were deep! Especially the line ""I was there when he said that he would sell his soul for 1 million dollars and I'll be damned if the devil did'nt have a receipt (...)! I couldn't get that line out my head throughout the movie. It's crazy! I don't think that no one was misrepresented here due to the story still have that same ring that it always had just those who was there during the genesis of the label is telling the story this time, but I was expecting to hear those Death Row cuts besides the Tales of the Darkside tune throughout the movie. Other than that it's official ! I'm thinking about getting that Suge Knight Presents... Cause I can't get enough info on the label and the 2Pac/B.I.G. unsolved murders. A real fan is never satisfied! I'll continue on buying as long as it's official !It is what it looks like and this be what it be !"
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"If you are a Death Row fan, then spend your money on a better product. Buy Suge Knight: The Real Story from Suge Knight Films. This film is full of lies and hearsay. Dont wast your time or money. One."
3,"Death Row is Dr. Dre, Snoop, Daz, Kurupt, Makaveli & Outlawz","Every damn Death Row documentary focuses on the same sh_t. Come on, tell me about the early days and how DPG came to be. Tell me how Daz met Kurupt, and how Dre signed all of them. There was only 10 basic members to the first Death Row family. And here they go again focusing on Suge (boring story heard a million times) and Dre leaving. No talk about DPG & Outlawz??? Barely anything interesting on Makaveli & Snoop*. Same East vs. West sh_t we been hearin'. Tell me about how Makaveli created these masterpieces, not what he thought of Biggie. I know that sh_t, its old. Snoop* - there was a side interview in the special features that had Snoop talking about Daz, D.O.C., Above The Law. Stuff I never knew, but it wasn't even in the main feature. That is the reason why I gave it 3 stars. Rent, don't buy it. Go buy some DPG albums instead."
4,Nice Documentary,"For anybody who used to be a Deathrow fan, you will like this. This video is basically behind the scenes at deathrow. It has interviews with a number of people affiliated with DeathRow Records. Its really full of intresting facts that have never been told, from how the record label came about and how it went down. It also has some footage of Tupac, and footage of the East Coast and West Coast feud. You wont regret gettin this."
4,Tells the Untold story on Death Row,"Alot of candid interivews on Death Row's orgins. Documentary moves very fast. Compelling chapters. Much better then the poorly produced/interviews on Tupac: Thug Immortal.This DVD goes into more detail about the behind the scenes of death row then the VH1 Behind the Music Specials on Dr Dre and Snoop.Unfortuanely, Dre-Snoop-Outlaws did not contribute to the making of this DVD (scared?), so it falls a bit flat in comparison to the BTM specials."
4,Inside look at the Infamous Death Row,"This documentary does an excellent job of exposing some of the good, bad and ugly of the infamous gangster rap record label ""Death Row"" and how it was run in the 90's. From the overbearing and mostly in the way behavior of Suge Knight to the genius artistry of Tupac Amaru Shakur as well as Dr. Dre (Andre Young) and Snoop Dogg it's all covered."
2,disappointed,"It took a long time to ship. The jelly was extremly sweet and short on the pineapple taste. Between the price of the product and the cost of shipping it was a ""high priced disappointment"". Won't make that mistake again!"
4,Great Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, it kept the attention and was very well acted. I have always enjoyed Patty Duke too, so that was an extra bonus."
2,slowwwww to ship,"Ordered and paid for 10 days ago. Still not a package in sight.All other orders from amazon came within 2 to 3 days after confirmed payment. RIDICILOUS ""VISION"" ON DELIVERY OPTIONSSHIP ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY IN 3 DAYS BY UPS OR FED EX"
3,Comprehensive!,"I was assigned this text for my first women's studies course and I couldn't have been happier with the professor's decision. Reading it was easy and interesting. The language used is simple, to the point and keeps the reader's attention. The concepts discussed are relevant, current and worth learning more about. I stepped away from this book having gained a different world view."
4,great for first time fans,"i saw goran in concert twice and i have collected quite a few albums.this one is a great introduction since there are quite a few ""hits"" here but more than that, it is a good sampler of what i saw on stage and that was absolutely great.goran is a guide on a journey through alcohol induced fun and dance, melancholy songs about love and country, traditional ballads about life...the weakest parts are the english songs...buy the cd...catch his concert."
4,Good shock misleading ride height,I installed this product on a 99 trans am with a sts turbo kit. The only problem is that the shock lowers your car by about an inch which with a sts kit can be bad. The turbo kit is a rear mount and is already close to the ground. My car scrapes both in and out of my driveway. On a better note the car handles very well and the shocks are worth the price.
5,One of the most underrated and sophisticated American novels of all time,"This was Kantor's Magnum Opus, and he spent years researching and writing this book. It shows. Arguably one of the most underrated, yet best pieces of truly American fiction. Sophisticated, detailed, and profoundly realistic, this book cannot be read and appreciated in a few days. The characters honestly come to life, as Kantor spends pages upon pages of describing every aspect of their lives. The character's hopes, dreams, thoughts, and personalities are revealed to the reader in such an in depth way, it becomes impossible not to form a personal connection with the characters. For a good book, nay, a once in a lifetime book, I would strongly recommend the purchase of Spirit Lake."
4,Sklz Rainmaker Review,"This piece of equipment is essential for the development of shooting confidence. After about an hour of shooting with the rain maker,my eight year old son admits that once it's taken off, the rim looks like an extra wide bucket."
2,Guitar Giant Settles For The Pop Market,"It becomes evident upon first listening, that Robbie Nevil is a fine musician. Specifically, his jazz-inspired guitar breaks permeate this recording and bring excitement to what is, otherwise, a rather obvious example of pandering to pop sensibilities. It is not that the songwriting is bad, he has plenty of practice as a major lable in-house songwriter and, indeed, it takes skill to compose this type of pop/funk;rather, Mr. Nevil is capable of so much more. A more jazz or fusion-oriented approach would allow this monter guitarist the room he needs to really stretch out. And, whatever the merits of the compositions, one has an uncomfortable feeling of listening to a jazz artist caught trying to work within the constraints of the 3 minute pop format. It is not very convincing and you just know that mr. Nevil does not sit around his house playing this kind of stuff. If only we could hear his real gift, what a recording that would be!"
4,A Very Unique Diary!!!,"Reed Massengill started photographing Brian Hess in 1992 at the age of 18. Over the next nine years Massengill photographed this model's coming of age and physical transformation, from a young man to a mature independent man. Over the years they became very good friends. This is a very different kind of diary showing how radically Brian changed over the years, and how he changed physically by adding tattoos, piercings, and scarifications on his body.Brian is a very handsome young man, which adds to the wonderful photos Reed did over the 9 years. The photos can be very serious, introspective, fun, and very erotic indeed. I really enjoyed this book because it's always fascinating to see the changes people go through over the years. Brian changed so much in appearance but basically remains a very handsome man. If you like Brian's looks you'll love this book, but even if you don't it a very interesting photographic study. Well done!!"
4,An Older Mold...But A Classic,"This one has been around a while. But Hasegawa hit the ball out of the park, on this one. Excellent mold detail And just about perfect, except for one item. The top of the wing halves have several low spots that need to be sanded and filled. Not a big or tough job, but needs to be done or it will show itself on the finish. Otherwise, this can almost be built from the box. The only PE I added was seatbelts, exhaust, cowl mg's and decals. These items pretty much get replaced on every model out there, anyway. The exhaust is usable but will need drilling out. Also, for the purists the tires could be replaced.One last thing...mounting the wing to the body is pure genius. I wish more manufacturers followed this example. A well thought out model that results in an excellent display piece. Well done Hasegawa."
4,A wonderful baroque organ,"I had never appreciated Gould at the organ before this. The wonderful pedal tones, and the responsiveness of this instrument make it a most contemplative experience."
5,"Amazing, terrible, profound...","Gould's final performances of the Art of the Fugue - particularly the final, unfinished Contrapunctus XIV - are absolutely stunning. They are probably as close to divine as music can aspire.His earlier attempt to master Bach's monumental work is on organ and it is a shocker - the first 10 tracks of this cd are worthy as a curio or for the perverse.But the last half of the album redeems the organ catastrophe and then some. Listen to the last fugue and realise that even with Gould singing, even unfinished, it is truly awesome."
3,Great for pre-teens,This book is good for any family with slightly different beliefs and traditions. Great for children who wished their taditions could be more accepted.
4,This was a gift,I purchased this as a gift. Have not read the book yet myself but I was told it was a nice book.
4,"Good, gritty mystery","Good atmosphere, good characters, pretty believable story. The only thing is, when the murderer decides to kill McMorrow, it's not quite believable that McMorrow falls for his trap so readily, carelessly going out to the canal all alone. And wouldn't McMorrow's murder really only draw more scrutiny into the whole affair? From the book's point of view, the story had to end like this, but logically, in life, it would have made more sense for the murderer to have just moved out of town."
5,Marvelous Maine Murder Mystery Makes Me Merry,"Mr. Boyle has written a good, solid mystery. Jack McMorrow is a wisecracking journalist who left the New York Times to run a rinky-dink newspaper weekly located in a remote Maine paper mill town. Speaking as a person who grew up in a very similar environment, the author's description of living in such a community (a poorly disguised Rumford, Maine) rings very true. It contains just the right amount of colorful characters, wisecracking banter, mystery and suspense to keep the reader's attention until the very end. Mr. Boyle has a wonderful, sparse writing style which fits this genre well. I look forward to reading the second Jack McMorrow installment, ""Bloodline."" I fun summer read."
2,Not the greatest mystery ever written,"Slow moving mystery set in the mountain town of Androscoggin, Maine. The photographer for the weekly newspaper is found dead in a remote area of town and nobody seems to think it is suspicious, except the local editor, Jack McMurrow. The story moves very slowly and only picks up speed as it approaches the conclusion, and the conclusion leaves many honest questions about the plausibility of how the mystery is finally solved. Gerry Boyle started his career as a police beat reporter, and it shows. His writing style is that of a reporter and not a novelist. His novel is filled with 'filler' that fails to contribute to the story line and only succeeds in adding to the page count of the novel. If you pass on this novel you won't miss anything."
5,Wisdom for all Seekers,"I couldn't put it down from start to finish. The human journey within is so easily identifiable, whether you're affiliated or non-affiliated to a religion, everyone will benefit from its words of wisdom."
5,Very early cookbook,As much a history book as a cookbook and I read it as such. A cool read. Vey fun and educational.
4,"Robert Townsend: Partners in Crime, Vol. 4",I bought this DVD for my brother and he was extremely happy with the DVD. You sent it so quickly and made sure it was unharmed in transit.
2,Relief! I'm not the only one...,"...who was a bit disappointed by Fundamental. The album seems a bit ""bodyless"" to me, and I miss the little saucy details which usually make the Lady's music so unique. But who is in best shape every day? I am looking forward to the next Bonnie Raitt album, anyway."
3,"UNEVEN BONNIE, BUT.....","Since ""Luck Of The Draw"" Bonnie Raitt has been releasing uneven albums in the studio. Maybe the blame can fall on her record producers. I still like her live in concert and DVDs as well. ""Fundamental"" comes at times like a jam session. There is really nothing special on this CD, except for ""The Spit Of Love"". When are we going to hear a song like ""When The Spell Is Broken"" again? Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums. One thing I did like was her taking a risk after going too commercial. The previous albums started to be too much of a predictable formula. I do hope Clapton's team gets with it and books Bonnie Raitt in a future Crossroads Festival. Why was she the only player at these things that has been excluded?"
2,Is someone filling in for Bonnie?,"Weak, cliched, and over produced, Fundamental sounds like more like someone trying to emulate Bonnie, rather than the real thing. Nothing stands out on this album. I am an avid Bonnie Raitt listener and eagerly await each new arrival. However, she seems to be either stagnating or selling out to the high-selling and bland Yuppie market (all the way down to the fashion statement album pics). Fundamental continues the downhill slide that followed Nick Of Time. Don't be surprised if her next album is heavy with big name guest artists.I'll take her Nine Lives album over Fundamental anyday!"
2,Try Luck Of The Draw Instead,"See Bonnie Raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs, actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `The Fundametal Things', but no."
1,What a dissapointment!,"After being convinced that I would never hear a Bonnie Raitt song that I didn't like.....I have now heard an entire collection among which there isn't one I DO like!Seems like an experiment gone terribly wrong....please don't do that again, Bonnie!"
2,Disappointing playlist and production,"Bonnie Raitt is my favorite musician and I will always buy any album she does. This one, however, coming after four earthshakingly great albums was a real bummer. Boring songs and really bad production. Did she have a fight with Don Was? No songs stayed in my head, and pretty much everything reminded me of something on another album. Oh well."
4,"an orange cty. fan, Bonnie at her best,","you can listen to the cd over & over, i don't suggest you play random for this. Bonnie has set the mood for you & she's gone back to the music that got her started."
2,Production is intrusive and at odds with Raitt's groove.,"I don't care for this much. There's a few good tracks but Mitch Froom's ""quirky-for-the-sake-of-quirkiness"" production seems real forced. It sounds like he came up with the junkyard groove arrangements and then had Bonnie sing over the top of them. That stiff clank-clank stuff may sound great behind someone like Tom Waits, but Raitt has a different way of feeling the beat, so it never seems to gel.While I can appreciate Raitt's willingness to try something different, this experiment didn't really produce favorable results. The string of albums with Don Was (producing) were among her best and the change of producers was a ""mistake"", at least as far as the listener is concerned.Disappointing album."
1,fundamentally blah,"One reviewer says this is the best blues ever heard. Get out of the house and open your ears!! This album sounds like it was called in from a phone booth. Sorry, Bonnie, I'm only disappointed because I've heard you do so much better."
2,Fundamentally went wrong,"Tried it a couple of times and although the songs are good, the production is mediocre. Sounds out of phase, almost mono it its reproduction. Very little character to Bonnie's voice which comes across harsh and flat. Probably sounds OK on a car radio, but not for a good hifi system which reveals the flaws."
1,NOT MARILYN MONROE,"Please, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. This is NOT Marilyn Monroe. It is in fact, Arline Hunter. It sickens me that this film is being sold simply to cash in on Marilyn's name. You can view screen captures from this film all over the web. Any true Marilyn fan will instantly see that the woman in this movie is NOT Marilyn."
1,"BUYER BEWARE! NOT MM, NOT ARLINE EITHER!",Arline Hunter is not in this film! Marilyn Monroe is Not in this film either! This is an ongoing legend. The woman in the film is not as pretty as Arline or Marilyn. Buyer BEWARE. I can't believe Amazon is listing this TRASH!
2,Really Marilyn?,"I wonder what film is stored at the Erotic Museum. The one of the three films that look the most like Marilyn, in my opinion, is the second film. That one has been stated as being acted by Arline Hunter. It is a much better quality and is more believable as it is primarily a tease film with poses like Marilyn made in her career. The other two simply do not look like Marilyn and the quality is so extremely bad, it is doubtful anyone could be certain. Also it seems doubtful that anyone filming would do it with such poor equipment. A stage film is shot to be seen. The first and third film are basically unwatchable."
5,"Fun, fun, fun","This novel is extraordinary funny.The main character, Malory, is the military commander of an arctic scientific outpost, who acts as a mindless horny teenager whenever she is around the outpost cute doctor, Corky, the only other female around.Corky deeply hates, despises and wants to painfully kill Malory for her antics. Their interactions are hilarious, thanks to the gross sense of humor of Malory. But their relationship slowly evolutes and Corky learns to appreciate, care and finally love head over heels the caring and loving heart that Malory is hiding under her bravado's mask.We also enjoy a funny parody of terror fiction, when a zombie outbreak takes control of the outpost and Malory, shotgun in hand, has to save the day, save her crew and her love. ""Hail to the Queen, baby"".This book is a must-have."
4,lesbian sci-fi horror!,"i really love this author. this book is well written, refreshing, and very fun. oh, and the sex scenes are NICE."
5,AWESOME BOOK: PERFECT FOR MAC EVANGELISTS & APPLE LOVERS,"Guy Kawasaki has written a great book on Apple and the Apple business method. Very funny. Extremely unique and marvelous, like Apple. Perfect for brushing up your Mac Evangelist skills! One of the best books I've ever read, and I'm not even done! Guy truly embodies the Macintosh Spirit. everything about the book, from the footnotes to the illustrations, is like the artistic perfection of Macintoshes! GUY KAWASAKI RULES!!!EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK AND BUY A MAC!!!!!!"
4,Pass the salt,"Good price on these shakers. Sure beats wondering if Wal-Mart will have them in stock. If you need a lot of shakers I can recommend this purchase. I would have thought more care would have been taken with packing. Bought two 12 packs, and one out of each pack had shipping damage."
4,"Good product, but take care of it...","Works well, scale seems accurate enough. However I went on a couple saltwater fishing trips and neglected to clean it after each one ... got noticeable rust spots and a bit stiffer operation. Nothing that a bit of WD40 didn't fix, but I'd definitely recommend making sure you clean it well after each trip (especially saltwater). Overall very satisfied, the grippers work well and are solid."
4,"Does what it is supposed to do, what more would I want?",Works well. Have had it and used it for a few weeks. No problems encountered so far. Nice item at a fair price.
1,Poor Quality,"First one fell apart early in fishing season. The gripper came loose from the handle/scale part. Fortunately, all the pieces fell in the boat. I returned it to Berkley and got a replacement. After a couple of months use, the second one started to give wrong weights. I wouldn't recommend this unit."
4,wish I could do a proper review,"I used this for precisely one fishing trip. Somehow, I managed to misplace it as I was loading up my vehicle. Boy, I was pissed. What I can say about it is that it's fairly large and heavy owing to the additional scale readout built into the handle. I did not have the opportunity to validate the accuracy of the scale. And instead of purchasing the same unit as a replacement, I opted to buy a smaller, lighter, cheaper lip gripper and a separate Berkeley digital scale. I have rated it 4 stars because it performs as expected but was a bit too large and heavy for my purposes."
1,HUNK OF JUNK,ACTUALLY I'M NOT ABLE TO GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW ON THE ENTIRE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT FILLED UP WITH RAIN WATER THE FIRST TIME I WENT OUT IN THE BOAT.I NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO USE THE GRIPPER. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE BATTERIES GOT FILLED WITH WATER AND THE DIGITAL SCALE FAILED TO WORK ON THE FIRST TIME OUT.AVOID THIS PRODUCT. I RETURNED MINE.
4,A Good Recording,"This recording of Bach's Christmas Oratorio is an early digitalone from Hanssler Classics it has been reissued in theirMasterpiece Collection series. The libretto and liner notes canbe downloaded from the Hanssler web site. This is one of thebetter recordings of this work. The soloists aquit themselvesquite well, the chorus does well too, and the orchestra does too.This is a modern instrument style performance as opposed to theGardiner, EBS, MC recording on Archiv. I have no troublerecommending it at all."
3,Comfy but not sturdy,"Purchased this air mattress to sleep on when I gave my bed to my ""vacation"" guest. It was very comfortable and easy to inflate. However, after two nights of sleeping on it, one of the ""baffles"" popped and left a ""bubble"" in that spot which made it out of proportion. I was able to put that area at the foot of the bed and continue using it. Only slept on the mattress about 10 times over the course of the summer and then it developed a ""leak"" which I was never able to find. Ended up tossing it out and purchasing a different brand at Target. Must say the Wenzel was more comfortable than the new one. Too bad it was not sturdier."
5,"So far, so good","Has worked well for my mom, whom I purchased it for. She has been helping out at my brother's quite a bit and has been using this to sleep on during those occasions. So far, it's held up..."
2,cheap as cheap does....,"bought htis for limited use, camping, I am kind and careful of my gear.I used this for three nights, good news it blows up in seven minutes with the hand pump.Bad news it had several slow leaks that got worse every night, by the the thrid night I had to pump it up twice while trying to sleeep.amazon will pay shipping back, so it goes back and I will try another model."
1,Might not last long!,"Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester.After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much.Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing."
3,Adequate but marginal on comfort,"Slept on it for a week. Appears to be well built. Built in pump is handy (and eco friendly vs battery powered pumps) and was easy enough to pump it up, even my 78 yr old mom could do it. Held the air well, only needed to give it a few extra pumps every other day or so. My only beef was that it felt lumpy with the deep cushion style indentations, but then maybe I had it pumped up too hard. Anyway I found myself waking up often trying to get comfortable. But it'll do for short durations."
4,Worth the money,My wife left me and took all the furniture and the kids furniture so I needed some temporary replacements. My 3 children told me that these air beds are more comfortable than there original beds. Thanks for bailing me out of a bad situation.
1,Bad news,I bought 2 one only lasted a week before it leaked then the seam split around the pump. The company sent a new one but they don't seem to hold up.
2,Dissapointing,The pump wasn't what I was expecting. Time consuming to inflate and difficult to deflate.
1,Failed after 9 months.,"The title says it all. Worked flawlessly for 9 months (had it mated with a Tivo series 3), and then failed. The Tivo drive tests say that it is suffering from read errors.The drive warranty is only one year. That says a lot about the product, but fair enough. So, I go to the Western Digital support site and enter the serial number. It says the drive was manufactured in 2006 and I need to provide a purchase receipt to get warranty coverage. A hassle, but again, fair enough. So, I find my Amazon receipt online, save as PDF, upload to Western Digital support site and... nothing. No response except an email saying they have received my message. That was 10 days ago. I again send an email. Again, no response. Perhaps they are trying to wait out the warranty. Anyway, given the hassle, I can't recommend this drive."
1,Not worth buying,"I bought this external HD in December 2006. Now in November 2007, the unit clicks and clicks and clicks LOUDLY! My computer recognizes that the hardware is attached but does not show the drive in my computer so I can't even use the stupid thing!I didn't buy at Amazon. I wish I didn't buy it at all."
1,3 Dead Drives in 18 Months,"We bought two of these drives 18 months ago. Within 6 months, one was dead - bad drive sectors, 300gigs of data lost, and it wouldn't even let me reformat to try over again. I received good customer service, and a new drive. Three months after the new drive arrived (9 months after purchase), the second original drive died, same problems, data lost.Now, 18 months after we first bought the drives and a year after this new replacement drive was sent, IT dies too! Again, bad sectors, windows fails to write, ALL 300GIGS OF DATA LOST.I bought this drive when Amazon had it available, but I will never buy a Western Digital brand again. After being burned THREE TIMES, I'd be a fool to trust their products!"
2,Don't Buy A plug-in external,"I bought this drive and it taught me a lesson. I planned to use it with my laptop but since the drive needs it's own power supply it's not very mobile. I should've gotten a USB powered drive instead. If you want more storage space for your home, just buy an internal and have your kid install it. Also, WD's SATA enclosures are terrible. They bend the SATA cable at 90 degrees which causes guaranteed failure. So if you have one of these and it no longer works, take the HDD out of the enclosure and put it in your PC. You should be able to get your data. (Doing that will probably void your warranty)"
3,"Great Features, good support, questionable quality",This drive has some great features like dual interface and auto power down. It worked as soon as I plugged it in (USB) and worked for just over 11 months before it died. I found that it would work for a few minutes after being powered up and then fail. I was able to erase it and WD sent a new one. I paid to send back the old one but they have a deal with UPS that saves a little over a buck. The new one didn't work at all. I just sent it back and they are sending another. It was great while it worked and they did make warranty replacement easy but the quality is not what I expect from WD. With the new drive I'll have only a 30 warranty.
2,Would have been great if....,"....my computer would have recognized it. Spent hours trying to get it to work. Reading someone elses review, I now see that I'm not the only one. Something about certain adapter cards not being compatable. Very annoying, wish they said that on the box. Returned it to Bestbuy. Got a LACIE hard drive-much cheaper and worked right away."
1,Check customer reviews for the 500 GB Essential version - same story here,"Same story like some other customers:After less than 1 year of usage (used it to store TV movies) the drive started to make strange noises - no way to get XP recognizing the drive anymore (tried several computers).Got a new drive from WD, however, this one is not working as well. I wrote to customer support three times and didn't get ANY response for about five weeks now.What else should I say?"
2,NOT FOR TIVO,"Decent hard drive,a little slow with USB. Originally purchased for TIVO HD expansion, the model number looks the same but it is not supported by Tivo. Do not try to link with your DVR, but it does make a good Time Machine back-up for my Mac."
3,Good for some things not others,It was pretty cool. Plugged it in it worked straight no issues till I tried to store a file that was 7 gigs it would not support that. So I moved my iTunes library to it instead. Im not unhappy kust mildly dissapointed because it wont do what I wanted it for. But if you only intended to store file smaller than 6 gig this is for you.
1,"Works Great, then Dies leaving you scrambling, shame on WD!!","I've had this for a little over a year, notice only a one year warranty comes with it. PLEASE do not store anything you really don't want to lose on it. I had about 250 gigs stored from my photography company, luckily I run more than one machine. It died, oh, it comes on and the USB port shows something there, but the device is clicking like a tap dancer on speed. Try to use one of WD's data recovery preferred partners with price starting at $595.00. I will be moving up to a more reliable brand after I try to get all my stuff off of this dead one. THANKS WD!!!"
2,Helped my dog somewhat,"This worked better than the shampoo. But ONLY for hot spots. Even then, it still only reduced scratching of those spots by 50%, if that. When I applied it to general small areas where he is digging with his back feet (sides, sides of face and chin) it did nothing. The best way to apply it is only to hotspots (rashes from digging) or to a bigger yet still smallish area, in which you would have to have your dog have a very short haircut. This is the last resort after I have tried everything else (changing food to non-color, non-chicken & non-beef, treating carpets for mites/bugs, and a dozen other things). The only thing I havent tried yet is herbal medicine that the vet said would help a lot, but it is expensive. Only cortisone shots work, and they are expensive and last about 2 months. Its a shame I was hoping this would work at least half as good as all the other reviewers have said, but it doesnt for my dog."
3,Did not worked for my Shih Tzu,"I got lots of recommendation on the hot spot treatment, but at least for me...this one did not worked.Product itself may work, but, before purchase the medication, you should try your loving one exposed to the alergy.In my case, when I switch the food, the hot spot issue resolved."
1,Not good for my collie...,"I have a rough collie with a little hot spot on his thigh. I applied this on a cotton ball to the area gently. My dog was in so much pain from the sulfadene he looked at me wide-eyed and was shaking, it must've burned a lot so I immediately stopped, put some aloe on the hot spot & petted him until he relaxed. Unfortunately, this product doesn't work on my dog so I give it 1 star. I'll have to keep looking around for a natural hot spot remedy for my dog..."
5,the best ever !!,"My german shepherd had a hot spot on her front left leg. She was nibbling at it to the point of almost making a sore. If I took her to the Vet she would wear a collar and get steriods and I didn't want either for her. I asked someone and they recommended sulfodene. My dog licks and eats ""everything"". She hated the smell and did not lick it. I had to be sure to put enough on and not just ""dab it"". I really never thought it possible ! This is going to be a staple on my shelf. I'm sorry I didn't know about it sooner. Believe me I'm spreading the word !"
4,Very absorbing read,"Definitely a ""women's"" book, but anyone who is a woman, who has been single, who has been married, who has sisters, a family, love relationships, parents or children, will relate to the lives and problems of these very realistic and believable women. I was wishing the book would never end. It may not be the greatest book, but it involves the reader deeply and is very affecting."
1,Movie Sunk Like USS Arizona,"I thought when I reviewed the caption on what was involved with this video that it would be a good purchase. I was scuttled. I can't say anything good about this video. The narration stinks, the movie clips are horrible, the historical facts on some of the narrative is questionable, and this video needs to be trashed rather than sold. This is one of the lousiest video's I've purchased, and all I can say is, I encourage anyone thinking about buying it to save your money, and if you want it bad enough, give me your address and I'll send it to you free, postage included. At least I'd be rid of this bilge rat of a documentary."
5,USS Arizona to USS Missouri: From Tragedy to Victory,This movie was a great portrayal of the Pearl Harbor Tragedy. It was very emotional and very detailed. An excellent movie!
4,Better than average hose for the price,I have used this hose with my freeman nailer for a few months now. I haven't had any problems with the material of the hose rupturing or any air leaks from the fittings. This hose for the price seems to be pretty fair. I have paid more for hoses that didn't last very long at all. I really don't think you can go wrong for the price. I would get another if something happened to this one.
2,Is ok but nothing wonderful,I LOVE books about weddings and I was really hoping to find something unique in this book. I was sadly disappointed as it offered nothing that I had not already read in dozens of bridal magazines and other books previously purchased.My opinion? Forget this book and buy the magazines. At least they have pictures to show you what they are talking about.
3,"Nice, but doesn't last","I really wanted this to be my ""signature scent."" But, it's gone in under an hour.... oh well, the smell is very unique though!"
1,cant play it on the comp,you have to have a very old computer to play it and my comps are too are to new and all my comps are xp and higher
1,Wig did not look like the picture,"I couldn't figure out how to shape the actual wig to match what the picture looked like. The wig came bunched up and it was not clear how the hair was supposed to be parted. Also, after trying it on a couple of times, the fine black mesh that was inside of the wig seemed to come out and I could not figure out how to get it back in."
2,Middle of the Road,"i can't understand why everybody&there Momma has to have a greatest hits but such is the case here.Wilson Phillips has this one.well aside from a couple albums what else did they do?i will give them ""Hold On"",""Give it Up"" my favorite of there's is ""Your'e In Love"" something about that song still holds up.i really dig that song.but they never came back&the material at best was Middle of the road."
4,Smart idea for EMI to do this.,"While some fans might irk at this idea, I like this album. Their best songs are well displayed here. This album shows more of Wilson Phillips' harmonies and their midtempo songs. They placed half from the 1990 album and half from the 1992 album on here. I thought that they would continue right after the second one--they'd be ten albums and many more platinum albums and hits later if they continued to stay together. But their new album ""California"" more than makes up for that long 12-year hiatus--I plan to get it soon. This album sounds good all the way through. They sell it for a low price in some stores, but the music is well worth it for that price. Very nice and gorgeous pop from these girls!"
1,-And why would anyone purchase this if?????,"-They could not listen to samples? I mean seriously, what makes a worthy purchase by a worthy group is being able to listen to a few samples...Shelve this one forever..."
2,The Giller Jury Disapoints Me,"It is beyond me why anyone would enjoy this novel, better yet,how the esteemed jury for the Giller Prize could think of nominatingthis book. It is poorly written and the plot and characters are sillyand inconsequential. None of the story is believable nor is anyof it particularly interesting or amusing. And I fail to see where anyof the humour is in the book. The humour that does exist is of thejock locker room variety, not very sophisticated or particularly interesting. The event that brings the characters together is so sillyand unbelievable, that the novel reminded me of an episode ofGilligan's Island. The whole thing reads falsely. And there is not oneappealing character among the bunch. I couldn't wait for the novelto be over and done with and on many occasions thought of givingit up because I found it so dull and silly. A dreadful read."
3,"Oh, get off the high seas for a moment...","I have enjoyed and admired all of Partick O'Brian's works, and this novel also served as a pleasurable read. Yes, I agree, thirty-odd pages of bleak Naiz prisoner stuff is a bit of a slog for an introduction, but ""prison"" is what the book is about- the artificial prisons we construct for ourselves and those that circumstances trap us within. No, this is not an adventure novel, unless self-discovery may be called an adventure, but it is a good read for those who want to visit another time and commune with a character seeking the solution to the maze he finds himself trapped in."
3,An interesting portrait,"No, it isn't as good as ""Testimonies"" or any of the Aubrey/Maturin books. But it is NOT terrible or colorless. I thought it was a rich portrait study that could have been resolved better, and (like some of the Aubrey/Maturin books) ends way too abruptly. Sure, would have loved to have more espionage explored in it. But this is O'Brian! We just don't read him for the rousing naval action, but for his prose and characters. And he paints a fine portrait in this one."
2,Not a Jack Aubrey Novel,"This is a look inside a confused artist from boyhood to when he is in his thirties or forties. The majority of the story is told from the mind of Richard Temple and it is confusing. The ending is lacking any conclusions. The story just sort of stops. I read the hardback edition which shows Richard Temple inside a German prison camp. Its an interesting read, but the ending left me wondering what was happening."
5,Lovely,"With the seemingly simple use of spare color, deliberate lighting, and delicate textures, this beautiful book captures the complexities and subtleties that we can only understand as paradise. It left me breathless. It does this in a most evocative, sensual, and modest form. Barker tells the story of paradise in the voice of Eve, beautifully aching, terribly innocent, and in hopelessly in love with her partner. Each poem is like a morsel from earthly heaven, more delicious than the last. Like no other collection I've read before, I finished this book in one sitting. It relives the most intimate moments between lovers who cannot help exploring the heights and depths of their human limits, their new understandings, and this amazing planet we in habit. It is a celebration of love and creation, in all of the generous bounty we can hope to grasp."
1,Disgusted,"This saw blade has proved to be of poor quality. The blade was installed and used to cut light gauge steel, of 18 to 20 gauge. The blade teeth wore out in a very short time and was unusable in less than a week. Some teeth broke and some lost their sharp edge after very short use. I am sorry that I ever spent good money on such a poor quality tool."
2,Only for the Undertaker Fans!,"I bought this tape when I didn't know wrestling was staged. I was a huge fan of The Undertaker but watching it now is brutal! This is purely for the old-school fans that love Undertaker, the tape features the legendary Undertaker w/. Ted Debiase (Actually ""Bulldozer"" Brian Lee) vs. Undertaker w/. Paul Bearer."
1,Very dissapointing,"This is a terrible selection of Taker matches that makes me question his greatness. First you get the Undertaker vs. Fake Undertaker. The crowd isn't into it at all, and rightfully so as it is a very boring match.Undertaker vs. Kwang is a decent match, but certainly doesn't belong on a highlight DVD.Undertaker vs. Yokozuna is pretty much standard fare for the Undertaker, and fails to grab your interest.Undertaker vs. The Anvil is a complete joke. The match ends in a countout! A complete waste of space. Undertaker vs. King was only on video, and is probably my favorite on the disc, although that isn't saying much. In summary, don't waste your money on this DVD."
3,Undertaker He Buries Them Alive is good,"IMy name is Michael, I give this VHS 3 star because it's normal,not good. I have the 1994 video release, and I want asking tothe people has the DVD version. Are there DVD extras and bonusfeatures in DVD? In my video there are four matches like Undertaker vs Yokozuna, Undertaker vs Kwang, Udnertaker vs JimNeidhart, and Undertaker vs.... i forgot sorry but it's not vs Jerry lawyer. And if anyone have the WWF video Undertaker Gravestmatches,i will buy 9.98 or 9.95 please e- mail me at niginwid @yahoo.com or call me at (503) 2335034 in Portland.But this videomust good"
1,Undertaker He Buries Them Alive is Suck,"Don't buy this DVD. This DVD is suck, becauseonly five matches there are vs Jerry Lawyer,Yokozuna, Undertaker, Jim The Anvil, and Savio Vega. There are not classic battles as extras inthis DVD, i want his classic battles with Bret Hart, Razor Ramon,King Kong Bundy, Ric Flair(old time),Mankind, Kane, Shawn Michaels,Diesel, and Mankind.This video is 1 star, because suck. I promise thereare Undertaker's DVD will many old matches likeUndertaker(1993), if Undertaker(1993) re- releasein DVD."
3,The Phenom of the WWE,"For more than a decade, The Undertaker (Mark Calloway) has been a driving force in the World Wrestling Federation. This hour-long dvd features matches from the early part of the deadman's career.You'll see The Undertaker facing off against:>Yokozuna>Kwang (Savio Vega)>Jim Neidhart>Jerry Lawler>Ted DiBiase's Fake UndertakerAt the $9.98 retail price, it's a great buy! Unfortunately, these matches were poorly chosen. Not found on the disc are his classic battles with Shawn Michaels, Kane, Diesel, Bret Hart, Hulk Hogan, or the demented Mankind. Bonus features are also lacking. I give it a rating of 3-stars, because I think a 2-disc set with the matches I mentioned would have been much better. I would have also liked to have seen the promos and spots leading up to the matches. Poorly done!"
3,Worth the price,"I just bought this DVD the other day for $8. I didn't get into wrestling until around the begining of the NWO era. I really like the matches on this dvd, I didn't care to much for the ""Bad Ass"" Taker I like the ""Phenom"" better. can't wait to see him return at Wrestlemania XX on March 14th. Anyways, well worth the price. :)"
2,Keep this DVD buried,What were they thinking? I'm a HUGE Undertaker fan and this DVD is just a tease and dissapointing. I agree I was hoping for a 'From the Vault' type DVD with the actual career spanning history of the Undertaker.Hopefully they are in the process of making one a DVD that The Undertaker deserves. A Neidhart match? Good God !
3,Old School,"Okay, first off, for all the people who think this is a new ""from the vault"" or ""ultimate collection"", you are far from the truth. As most people claim to be Undertaker fans, they have to realize that there was a very stale period in WWE(F) history. This dvd represents that. It was not only a bad time for the industry, but a terrible time for home videos. Until recently, with the additions of the ""from the vault""s and the ""ultimate colleciton""s, WWE home video was horrible (for the most part). This is a mere glimpse into the past of the deadman. I can't wait until he gets his own ""anthology"", until then, we all have to deal with a lackluster dvd and our memory of the great matches he put on in his prime."
3,"Out-of-date, but a priceless document of history","At this point, OUT IN THE WORLD is anachronistic, but this is a blessing: the gay and lesbian movement progresses globally, and the conditions - which in some cases are quite dire - Miller relates here have changed somewhat. Published at the dawn of the internet, the change has been dramatic in at least a few instances.OUT IN THE WORLD is still very valuable as a reminder of history, and of the struggles vast numbers of great people had to make to live with some dignity and security. In an era in which certain numbers of gay and lesbian individuals might be tempted to take certain hard-fought goals for granted, this is a vivid antidote to complacency.For a more up-to-the-minute investigation of the state of the gay and lesbian world, take a look at the 2003 documentary DANGEROUS LIVING: Coming Out In The Developing World, which revisits much of the same territory investigated by Miller.-David Alston"
5,go on a journey with Dr. Seager,"I found the style of this book to be unconventional and thereby uniquely engaging. This was not just Seager teaching you about Nichiren buddhism, soka gakkai, and Ikeda..but rather him taking you along as he leared about them more deeply himself. Having the opportunity to join a knowledgeable person as he himself derives conclusions and impressions from his experiences makes the book, or the story really, much more interesting and enjoyable to read."
4,A good start for people interested in the SGI - and skeptical,"In his lack of objectivity, Professor Hughes Seager provides a unique perspective on the Nichiren Buddhism as practiced by the SGI. (I am a member.) Professor Seager interweaves his exact 'subjective' experiences in researching this book into his academic look at the SGI. He freely admits the SGI hired him to write the book and he frequently wonders if situations have been orchestrated to make sure he would see things in a positive light. Any reader can ask themselves the same questions; that's what makes it a particularly good book for anyone who is interested in the practice but also skeptical--and that probably covers everyone."
4,Kidney diet,Well researched with good nutritional info and useful recipes. She does recommend coffee creamer a lot which has trans fat.
5,No need for boring and bland food if you cook from this book,"I bought this book for my son who will shortly be starting dialysis after he was told that any food that was tasty would be banned from his diet. I searched the net and found this book which was written by the wife of a man who is on dialysis and hated the bland and boring food he was required to eat. The recipes in this book are anything but bland and boring. What really stands out is that the author gives a breakdown of all the minerals, fats and carbohydrates contained in each recipe, making it easy for the person to calculate their daily allowances of each of these constituents. Furthermore the recipes are suitable for all members of the family as they are all delicious and easy to prepare."
4,"Well done, and helpful","The cookbook is very high quality. The recipes are good, and it is a good first book for those starting dialysis."
5,Great Book,This book verry much helps anyone that needs to eat right.I bought this book when my mom need help when her kidneys were giving out.I now have the book and still use it.
5,Buy this book.,"This translates the dialysis food lists of do's and don't into actual meals with nutrition information (potassium, sodium, phosphorous etc). There are doable, ""normal"" recipes for all meals of the day including desert. So glad I found this book!"
5,Incredible Book!!!,"I was used to eating out all the time and had no idea how to cook a meal, when I was told I needed to go on a renal diet. I thought I was either doomed to live on bread and water, or not live at all!! I've only had my book for a couple of days and I have already made several of the recipes. They were quick and easy to make, and many of the recipes use a lot of the same ingredients. They also tasted incredibly good!!! I was amazed!!! I learned that with a few substitutions and some portion control I can eat meals that are better than what I got in the restaurants! I feel like a gourmet cook already!!! Thank you so much for this book! It really is a life-saver!!!!"
2,Hidden Ingredients,"Palm oil and coconut oil, 2 of the least healthy oils, are used in the date sugar. I wish this was made clear in the description. I cant eat it!"
1,product not vegan,"when I received this product I discovered that it contains calcium sterate, which is made from animals. This should have been made clear before I ordered the product."
3,The 20D is a good camera that is overpriced here,I own the 20d . It's a good camera but with the technology today I would pay about $400 TODAY WITH THE LENS. If you want to pay this outrageous price but the newest cameras with better technology
1,very very over priced,why would you spend 1800+ dollars on an old 20d + an entry level lens when you can get 40d + 17-55 f2.8 is for the same amount of money. You must be crazy to buy this combo !!!Stop trying to rip people off!!!
3,Add $130 to your price...,"Note that this model ships with the 10.2 version of the OS rather than the latest (and much improved) 10.3 version. There's no upgrade. You'll probably want to buy the full version of the OS (retail $129).Otherwise an impressive, quiet machine."
2,The G5 does not support Virtual PC,"The G5 does not support Virtual PC. If you want to run dual operating systems, do not buy this computer! I'm stuck running two computers now."
1,Lame duck,"Due to the lack of support for this product, I have to rate it low. The service of an Apple computer requires that you mail it off for repairs constantly. Add in the enormous shipping and insurance costs to the price, and it's not such a good deal. Also, while its gone, you cant use it, so obvioulsy even if it were free it still woul not be that great a deal.Alienware PC's are much faster and cost several hundred less on average."
1,Not For Me,Bought this scanner for the sole purpose of scanning 35mm mounted slides. Never could get a single slide scanned. Did not have the time or the inclination to pursue the issue with Epson. Gave the scanner away and obtained one from another manufacturer that works just fine.
2,slow & noisy with basic software,"I replaced a 5+ year old Acer which bit the dust, and am I sorry it did. Pluses: The Epson can scan slides and negatives; can scan multiple pix and ""separate"" them. Minuses: You press the 'copy' button, and again, and again, cuz you think nothing's happening - then 18 seconds after you pressed it the first time the copy program pops onto the screen (and I have 3Ghz with 1MB RAM)! My wife often crops and resizes her scans, which was a breeze with the software that came with my Acer, but torture with Epson's. She would also 'tile' a portion of a scan to make multiple copies on one page, which the supplied software can't do. And it's twice as noisy and half the speed as my old one with comparable resolution. The price was ok, but now I have to buy third party software to do fairly basic stuff.Needless to say, considering Epson is a big name, and I thought a 5 year newer scanner would be quieter and faster, with good software, I was terribly disappointed."
2,Death after 3 scans,"Initially I was very impressed. I had the scanner hooked up and the software installed in no time. I immediately scanned about 3 photos just to make sure it was working and I was surprised at how quickly it did them and good they turned out. Two weeks later after not touching the thing, I tried to scan something and it refused to work. After a half hour on the phone with Epson support, it was determined that it was a hardware issue and I needed to return the product."
3,Great price and feature set,Under Win XP the device installed quickly and seamlessly. The buttons on the front of the unit allow for a one-stop scan or more sophisticated features are accessed with the included software.
4,Epson 3490 Scanner,"As typical from Amazon, delivery was excellent. Product worked right out of the box. Excellent software included and due to TWAIN, can be used with any application that allows access to scanning.Large and small photos, gray scale or color, scan perfectly. Conversion from and to slides and film strips could be a bit less involved. Speed is average. A great buy for the money."
4,Epson Perfection 3490 Photo Scanner,"works great, once I took the time out to figure things out even the the quick buttons on the front of the scanner worked but its not intuitive. So its 4 stars cause I can't give it a 4 1/2"
3,Effective and speedy,"This works as expected, but I really disliked the Mac software it came with and opted to scan and edit via Photoshop. Also, it only scans 3 slides/pass. Sorta lame if you have hundreds to do."
1,Disappointing,Very poor quality. I know the book would be old but it was dirty and smelled like mildew. Not what I expected at all!
4,An excellent resource,"This book looks at everything from a history of cartoons to marketing your own work in modern media. The book discusses composition, perspective, styles, techniques... of course it does not go into any of these in any depth. That would be for other works or classes. But this will give anyone a good overview of the business and I consider it a valuable resource."
3,"Not much for drawing, but...","This book is actually quite useful. It gives you some real important tips on copyright and licensing that are INDISPENCEABLE. While it is laking somewhat in terms of how-to-draw, this is still a pretty good book"
1,trash,"After one month in my car this thing is registering bad. I go to amazon for a return slip and find that I am only going to a partial refund, have to pay shipping both ways-zero chance I will do that. Don't by trash like this, go to a local auro parts store so that you can at least have someone stand behind their product. What a let down-UPDATE-amazon was great, offered a total replacement and if paying shipment. as to the product, it obviously should have never gone bad in a month"
2,Dangerous if used for long time,"I bought HairMax laser comb about 3 years ago, and used it consistently as indicated by the manufacturer since the day I got it.Recently I started noticing a numbing sensation and some tingling on the left side of my face, near the brow, the cheekbone and chin. The tingling gradually got worse and persistent. I approached a neurologist who recommended I stop using the laser comb. A couple of week after I stopped using it, the tingling got considerably less, and then disappeared completely.Being an optimist, I thought maybe it was just a coincidence, and resumed using the comb. After the first night, I experienced facial tingling all over again. Then the following day it got better. I used the comb again 3 days later, and tingling returned again with considerable force.This may be just one person's observation, but do beware of the affect of laser on your tri-geminal nerve. If that nerve is damaged, it is irreparable and may cause terrible pains."
4,"Not super amazing in AZEK, but does the job","I used these biscuits in AZEK trim board. They are great for alignment purposes, which was my main concern. As far as ""Self Gripping"", these do not work well with AZEK. I haven't used them in anything else thus far."
4,Non-Fiction,"A reasonable book on the chess endgames, with some significant amount of time looking at the quite common variety of king and pawn endings.An older book, it uses old-style notation, so if you don't want to read that, get a more modern version. Following on from early work this is a reasonable piece of chess writing.3.5 out of 5"
5,Great bedtime reading for kids ! ! !,"I bought it for my three year old son, and I can't express how much joy my little one has every night when he goes to bed, he immediately runs to bed and literally ask my wife or me to start reading. I highly recommend it for all the little ones!! ! !, you won't regret it."
3,Anime's answer to Total Recall,"In the not to distant future, mankind colonizes the moon. However, one of the main companies behind the huge domed cities on the moon's surface appears to be planning on using some alien technology they've found to create a new weapon. A group of special infiltrators called Bounty Dogs come from Earth to investigate. One of them keeps having flashbacks about his sister dying, and is somehow linked to a bunch of evil little girl clones of her. What proceeds is a series of kickass car chases similar to BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, and action sequences with mechas designed by GHOST IN THE SHELL's Masamune Shirow. This isn't exactly the greatest 2-episode OVA ever made, but it is pretty up there if your a fan of action sci-fi. If you liked the manga SERAPHIC FEATHER, then this is right up your alley."
3,"Webster Spanish-English Dictionary, Williams","Just average. Adequate but nothing special. Misses many more recent forms. Lacks interpretation and variants. Still, OK for about Sophomore College applications. Reasonably priced. R."
1,Not enough words,"I purchased this dictonary to help me translate an essay by Garcia Marquez. Out of the first 20 words I looked up 16 were not present.These were not difficult, rarely used or obscure words. Just the words of a literate spanish writer. The rest of the translation was a similar problem. I can not recommend this dictionary for serious work."
3,New. Haven't used it much,I am sure that I will find this book helpful. However some of the words that I looked up wasn't it in.
1,"Stop sending me your spam. Imagine you buy a simple article in a groceries store, and the store manager keeps on bothering you","Stop sending me your spam. Imagine you buy a simple article in a groceries store, and the store manager keeps on bothering you.You wouldn't go there again would you?I promise to never buy with amazon again if you don't stop this"
2,Disappointing and meandering,"Prof. Singal has an interesting thesis here, one well worth exploring, but his book needs more focus. Singal wanders from psychobiography (including some ill-fitting speculation into Faulkner's neurological problems!) to literary analysis to critiques of other Faulkner critics. Singal ends his study when it reaches the midpoint of Faulkner's career, essentially saying that Faulkner did not write anything interesting after 1942 or so--and while this well may be a valid opinion, asserting it without substantiating it is a cop-out. At times I felt I was reading the work of a talented undergrad rather than that of a tenured professor.Readers interested in more rigorous studies of Faulkner's life and works should stick with Blotner's *Faulkner: A Biography*, Brooks's *WF: The Yoknapatawpha Country*, and Frederick Karl's relatively recent *WF: American Writer*."
3,its an average book,"This is a great book that has many series and has a lot of mysteries and action that will make you keep reading this book and wont let you put it down. It is about this creatures named Fone Bone, and his cousins that were kicked out of Bonneville. They go through a lot of adventures and meet new people. For example Thorn is Fone Bones' friend and Grandma Ben. They also meet this weird looking creatures that look like spiders and want to eat them. Another thing is that their is a big red dragon that always protects them. There is a lot of mysteries in this book to discover for example why is the dragon protecting them also why are the rat creatures chasing them? Also there is a book that tells you the story of Thorn's Grandma Ben it explains why grandma knows everything. The book also has many amazing pictures. Its a comic book and when, in addition when Thorn falls asleep she remembers part of it.So to really find out what is happening then read the book!"
3,Book for Son,"My son burned through this series, loved it, felt like he was reading something trendy. Good entertainment. Thanks to the seller for providing."
3,Uk release of Ms. Former Gospel tween star.,"This is the Uk cd single release of the moderately successful release in the States of the former Gospel singer Stacie Orrico. Now a favorite of the TRL crowd comes the single that came in the UK charts at #11. The reason and only reason to buy this single is for the FULL 8:25 Thunderpuss Remix!!! The original song was produced by Dallas Austin & Matt Serletic and that was a okay version. The remix was a number one Billboard Sales Chart hit in the edited US release and this remix is not one of Thunderpuss' best work. The other track ""Until I Find You"" is okay. An okay track from an artist who shows some promise to be the next Amy Grant."
5,"Unique, moody, beautiful","Robbie Robertson is perhaps one of the first rock musicians to successfully fuse Native American styles with contemporary music. This album is truly brilliant, I recommend it together with all of Robertson's earlier work."
5,Emotional Absinthe,"Better than therapy, lovelier than a summer rain, smoother than smoke, heart pounding like Bison, sentimental like a first kiss, tougher than leather, rapturous like love. Robbie Robertson delivers once again. This album does the very difficult: it communicates an authentic sense of culture and history without beating you upside the head, while also being totally OPEN and embracing to outside influence. This music communicates its history to you in simultaneously subtle and overt ways (just like most Indigenous people do in person), and speaks to your head and heart at the same time.And for good measure, it also gets you off your ass and gets you dancing. Now what could be better than that?For God's sake Robbie, you've made us wait long enough! Give us another album already!"
5,Awesome! About time.,"I'll be brief. This album is a must get for anyone wanting to hear a fine blend of Native sound, message and danceable rhythms. Sacrifice, with Leonard Peltier's voice is strong and moving. This is also one of those rare CD's where I like...really like nearly all of the tracks. Kudos and thanks to Robbie for this achievement!"
4,Robbie searches his soul,"Robbie Robertson has always been a talented songwriter and musician. Now through "" Contact from the Underworld of Redboy,"" he is giving something back. Sure the music is good (minus one star for drum machines instead of native drums) and the songwriting is good, but what makes this album great is the spirit. The spirit of the Native American, the spirit of Native American music and the spirit of the struggle of the Native American. Thanks, Robbie, sometimes we forget."
3,The Master Stumbles,"Robertson has had his hand in some of the best recordings of the modern era. This is far from one of them.Lazy writing and arranging hobble this half-baked set of songs with Native American themes. His earlier ""Music from 'The Native Americans'"" is much better developed, as are all his other solo releases.Over-reliance on programmed synths and loops prevent most of these tunes from taking fire. Robertson's trademark assets - passion and dynamic range - are held in check by this curious choice of sound and style.Robertson's return to his roots has been a welcome and surprising turn to his productive career, but we should hope he digs deeper on his next attempt."
5,A GOOD CD BY A GREAT MUSICIAN.....,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SONG ""IN THE BLOOD"" I HAD TO GET THIS CD. ITS FILLED WITH GOOD MUSIC Robbie Robertson IS ON MY TOP TEN LIST FOR CD'S TO OWN."
4,Good enough,"It is a disc holder. It is designed with separate sleeves for the cd's allowing you to re-arrange or take out as you wish.The two problems I had with this:- The sleeves had to be slightly stretched and did not fit comfortably on the binder rings.-The sleeves have plastic edges which are very easy to scrape your discs across accidentally if you are not very careful when removing them. Personally I believe they are designed this way so that you scratch your discs and they become unusable so that they cannot be sold used and new discs will need purchased, but I guess I'll have to be careful.Overall I thought it was decent in terms of what it is meant to be. It holds discs and is decently priced. This case comes with a sturdy handle attached."
5,a classic,"I have come back to this book time and time again, the voice is so clear and the range of characters so cleverly drawn and so real as to be breathtaking. I wanted to kill Isolt so many times, each time she stumbles into the trap, I know she is young but she is not blind, I find her one of the most fascinating protaganists of the last decade. Christopher is the dark satan, a wonderfully drawn portrait of abuse, poverty and dellusion. It is he I was sorry for in the end. His life was too cruel and arbitary for happiness to be his destiny. I hope more people read this book. It is an underground classic and will be remembered as one of the great books this century. I've no doubt it is a book I will pick up thoughout my life just to revel in the sheer poetry of entanglement, despair, and wierd salvation."
4,This CD is more than just bedroom music!,"I will admit it that I, too, bought this CD for the Sunscreen song. I mean, c'mon, who had really heard of this artist? But after listening to this CD once, I was hooked. The pomp and circumstance this CD reveals is right up there with any classic dance album. Check out different versions of The Cardigan's ""Lovefool"" and Prince's ""When Doves Cry,"" and Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time."" They give the original songs a run for their money. And the mixture of original tracks infused with remixes is wonderful. One listen to Doris Day's ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,"" and you will find the meaning of rejected love! The songs mostly come from the films that Buz directed, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet. And if you haven't seen Ballroom, you are missing out! This CD is more than the sunscreen song, so take a gamble, you will be amazed the purchase will redeem itself in your CD carosel!"
5,"This is the best song ""Everybody's Free"" I love the song.","The words from the song ""Everybody's Free"" has had me do a lot of thinking and has helped me change my attitude to be more positive and take time to enjoy life before it's to late."
3,"Sunscreen available elsewhere, you know","For those who care to dig, the April, 1998 issue of CMJ New Music Monthly (a magazine that includes a free sampler CD each month) featured ""Everybody's Free."" It can probably still be back-ordered, and would be a better value."
2,Words of advice for soccer moms,"Ah...the monotonous intonations of supposed ""wisdom"" for Generation Y. YEEECCHHH! This song is popular in the cubicle culture, meaning those that sit around in offices and listen to yuppie radio all day and latch on to the lastest fad. This song is the ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" of 1998, wihout the catchy riffs. My only hope is that this ""song"" will inspire interest in the spoken word, thus spawning sales for William Burroughs and Jello Biafra cds. Those are muchmore worthy of one's time and dollar."
3,Buy it for the Mary Schmich song only.,"Other than the Mary Schmich piece (originally attributed to Kurt Vonnegut) ""Everybody is Free to Wear Sunscreen,"" the CD is pretty much crap. However, ""Everybody"" just tilts the average value of the record up from zero to three.Too bad they don't release singles any more. Cuz, the rest of of the stuff on the CD is pretty weak.If you're interested, there's a great interview with Schmick on Simpleton.com."
5,"Simple, refreshing, and trully inspirational",Listening to the Sunscreen will make one pause and reflect on life. A reminder that the simple day to day things are really what make life worth living. In Short don't sweat over the little stuff. Do one thing everyday that scares you.
1,"Useless, puke inducing swill!","Those who plan on buying this album as a graduation or wedding gift for a loved one would be better off dispensing some THEIR OWN advice, rather than sticking this vapid cd in the player and saying, ""I feel this way, Jenny/Jake. I am profound!"" ICK! Please speak for yourselves, moms and dads. Don't let a soccer mom with a word processor tell you what is true. Pleeeaaasseee!!!1"
1,"Everything that goes around, comes around","Do you remember the song ""They're Coming To Take Me Away..."". Was a one hit wonder a long time ago with a guy talking. He was going nuts over the course of the song, and if I hear 'sunscreen' one more time, I'm think I'm going to go nuts as well. As quickly as 'coming to take me away' went away, so to will 'sunscreen' and this CD."
1,people pay money for this?,"If I could give you one piece of advice, save your money and don't buy this CD. This CD will be forgotten in a month or 2. (hopefully sooner)"
4,The speech may not be a song but it holds truth.,Everyone who is slamming Baz needs to shut the hell up this song/speech is great.
1,Don't bother.,"So you may have heard ""Everybody's Free"" and your thinking about getting the album. Don't. The song's novelty is sure to wear off and the rest of the album is lame. If you still want it after a couple of months, I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty of used copies for sale."
2,This is inspiring?,"""Sunscreen,"" though clever and quirky, is the last thing men need to regard as sound advice. It encourages determinism and superstition. Not to mention the fact that a spoken-word performance should be backed by something more substantive than unoriginal, pseudo-electronic trash."
1,Everybody's free... to make fools of themselves,"Geez, after listening to that dumb 'song,' I wondered why nobody yet has taken advantage of the numerous dupes who'll easily swallow the shallow Hallmark-card styled advices contained here, which I could've come up with in my stupor, by releasing numerous self-help books."
1,WhO CareS WhaT AnY of YoU ThinK,"I heard the song a few times and take from it as I please. Not exactly sure why you people get off on analyzing this damn song so much. Whether this is a SONG or not, just STFU and listen to it or don't listen to it..."
1,Um what did he do?,"On the ""song"" Feel Free, all that's there is a simple drumbeat. And those lyrics have been broadcast over the internet for years before that song came out. The rest of the songs on the CD are just there to sell Feel Free. In Pennsylvannia we have a word for this, PLAGERISM."
4,Unique Song,"Ok, people can say this isn't what they call a ""true"" song, but what is? I like the song Everybody's Free ( To wear sunscreen ) because it is different from the everyday stuff you listen to on the radio. Just think about it. Don't dis out the song just cause it sounds different."
5,perrffecctooo!!!,I loved this song it's the perfect life's story's of advice. it is the best worded song i have ever heard. i want to find the place where the lyrics are so i can print them out.if some one knows tell me!!!!!!!!!!!pRINCESS716@mailcity.com thanks
5,One of the most powerfull songs of the century...IMO!,"The first time I heard Everybody's Free, I was driving in Montgomery, AL. I had to pull off the road and listen to the entire song. It has such a powerfull meaning to everyone. Everybody should listen to this AT LEAST ONCE!! -AJM"
2,A one-song CD,"Most of the music on the CD is forgettable (possibly regrettable), and if not for ""Everybody is free"", the album would be a total loss. ""Everybody is free (to wear sunscreen)"" makes me think back to the unexpected popularity of ""Desiderata"" by Les Crane. Maybe the public really wants (and needs) good advice disguised as a catchy song. I know I stopped working on the yard and went in the house to hear it better when I heard it for the first time."
5,"THE NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM. LEARN IT, LIVE IT, LOVE IT!","The first time I heard this song, I was about to get out of my car. I had to pause because the words drew me in. I turned up the volume and tried to soak up every word. Like most people, I have things that I wish I could change about my past. As the song went on, my jaw dropped and I shook my head in disbilief as the lyrics described many of my regrets and worries that I've had about myself and my loved ones. I bought the CD with the intent of learning every thought. I hope to instill some these truths in my daily life. The ideas are all so simple. Why do we have to make everything so complicated?!"
