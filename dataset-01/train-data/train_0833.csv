5,So what's the beef?,"Before buying I read all the gripes and complaints about Kindle problems, no chaper numbers etc,no way to hold it blah, blah, blah after buying mine it's seemed to be a lot of whining about nothing, sure a few things could be improved but in truth what's not to like, Kindle is outstanding in many respects book downloading is awesome, it's easy to navigate, as for chapter headings and such who needs it all I want is to read the book content,further more I disregarded all the hype about problems becuase I've never been disappointed in anything I've ever bought from Amazon and that's a lot of different things, super easy to shop, order placing is a snap with one click and Amazon makes me feel as if I'm an important customer, prices too can't be beat anywhere in the world, hats off to you guys Kindle is just one more winner in a long line of winners, keep at it,"
5,Perfect for physically handicapped,"I spent a considerable amount of time researching the Kindle by reading the reviews posted to Amazon and independent reviews before purchasing. The original price of $400 was just too steep a price but when it dropped $50 I decided to try it. As a physically handicapped person (forearm amputee) it has always been difficult to read books, especially mass market and thicker books, because I could not keep them open. It would become tiring to fight with the pages so naturally, I tended to not read as long and it was more of a hassle to read. Audio books were one of my options and I listen when driving (audio books can also be played on Kindle). The Kindle has alleviated the physical hassle to reading and it is much much more enjoyable to read because I only need a finger to turn pages. I recommend the Kindle to anyone with arthritis, vision problems or arm amputee's as a viable option to read more with greater ease."
4,Kindle,"I like it. I've had my Kindle about a month and I love being able to ""carry several books"" with me with so little weight or bulk. I like that I can have a new book added without waiting for business hours or going to a store or waiting for a shipment. I don't like the fact that it is hard to find a place to hold it without accidentally turning pages. I have gone several pages forward and it is difficult to get back to your place. Because there're buttons everywhere, it isn't easy to hold it without doing something unintended. The cover doesn't help because the Kindle doesn't stay in the cover very well. I have considered sticking a piece of Velcro on the back of the Kindle and inside the cover to solve the problem. I haven't resorted to that yet. Despite the problems, I am glad I purchased the Kindle; I use it all the time."
1,Where are the books?,"The Kindle is an innovative new product that allows the user to purchase, read, and edit text from virtually anywhere. The design is sleek and operation is easy and user friendly. Blah, blah, blah.Not withstanding, out of a supposed 90,000 titles available, there seems to be very little worthwhile content available to download. Out of the first twenty books and periodicals I searched for, I got zero hits. What is available is a myriad of insipid garbage.The bottom line is this: If your literary needs can be met by a trip to an airport bookstand, the Kindle might be for you. Of course, one might wonder why you would need to save, highlight and take notes, etc. on your latest copy of Harry Potter, DaVinci Code, The Secret (insert latest crappie popular title here ad nauseam)...If you're interested in reading books that don't suck, save your $400. You can always purchase most of what is available on Kindle in a few months at a yard sale.But hey, other than that, great product."
1,Kindle: Made from re-cycled Commodore 64 computers,"This was the funniest, AND MOST ACCURATE, quote I've yet read. What a lame piece of equipment. Pay for blogs? Um, yeah, right."
2,"good idea, bad design","The kindle is an innovative device and is very useful. The problem with it was Amazon's design team's lack of simplicity and style. Basically, the kindle is boring and ugly."
4,my kindle,"you should sell new book spray. i miss the smell of new pages. never enjoyed used books. i think it was the spagetti sauce and the byproducts of sneezes. the dogeared and yellow pages etc. my reader is clean crisp. the print size adjusts to my comfort level. when i finish one i can be reading another in seconds. what's not to like. the critical people will always nitpick. if you give them a million bucks they complain about it not being in small bills. i love my kindle, love it you hear? marty"
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I live in Montana and there is no service for the Kindle here, something I didn't see in the fine print until delivery."
3,carrying case and page buttons,"The carrying case for Kindle needs to be redesigned. The device slips out and cannot be held securely with one hand. If one uses the rubber band to secure the device, the rubber band covers the page button and hence it is not practical.The buttons to turn the page are large and easily pressed when one is trying to handle the device, shift it from one hand to the other and so forth.Whereas the features such as the readability, the ""ink"", the ability to increase the font size and the quick downloads are exceptionally good, the design of some of the features, as noted above, need to be refined."
1,Kindle= bad news,"i think people really need to think before they act when it comes to the amazon kindle. Everything these days has turned into technology and inspite of the fact that technology is great i think once books can be stored inside a ""machine"" thats scarey. People who truely enjoy reading enjoy turning pages, and the smell of book, and the weight of books. Books are the last aspect of leaving the readers imagination to finish and invision the story and with a thin electronic device i feel that takes away from the beauty of reading. Please dont purchase the amazon kindle, go to barnes and noble and buy the real thing"
2,Nice Idea But.....,"Kindle is a good idea...in principle. But think about the charm that comes with reading a book and turning the pages with your bare hands that will be lost by the use of a digital books. Could we even call great reads page turners anymore? It's doubtful.In a digital age, books seemed to be the one thing we could hold onto as something forever non-electronic. Think on that."
3,Back light,"If it had a back light, especially one you could turn on and off, I would buy one in a second. Reading in bed without disturbing your bedmate is an unmet need!"
1,Deliver Block,"The Kindel Reader being not available in Canada is a complete and totaly unfair. Please do something about this problem. I have been a loyal customer and this is the first time I have been so disappointed. despite my having to choose a rating of one star I really have to choose ""0"".Brian Manuel"
2,Wake me when it's available for the iPhone.,"I'm not about to carry ANOTHER device around. I already have a MacBook Pro and an iPod...when Amazon ends production and decides we already have enough devices to carry....and ports this technology to the notebooks, iPods, iPhone and the slew of copycat devices or God forbid use existing technology like the Zinio Reader....wake me....otherwise.....*yawn*And yes....I have typed on the iPhone. Anyone with 3rd grade or better dexterity can type on it. You learned to type on a QWERTY, use a dial phone, a touch-tone phone, a cell phone....an iPod....figure it out.."
3,Oops...,"While I'm sure this is a fantastic device- one of my favorite things to do is read while I'm relaxing in a hot bath.This being said, I don't think this would go over well- in fact just last week I dropped my copy of ""His Dark Materials"" in the tub."
1,"Very, very disappointed!!","After much anticipation, I was extremely dissapointed. Although I grew up in the computer generation, if this is the future of book reading - leave me out!!"
5,Fantastic,The Kindle is great. It is so simple to use and it is awesome in one click to buy a book and have it in your hands the next minute. I am a big fan of the Kindle.
5,Best Purchase I have made in years,I am thrilled with every aspect of the Kindle. I use it for both Audio and Electronic books and have nothing but praise for it. I particularly love the ability to adjust font size on the fly and to to look up definitions of words immediately upon seeing them. Great job Amazon! My only concern is that I may go broke buying and reading books because it is so easy and fun to do so with my Kindle.
5,I have needed you for 30 years,"When you are a fast reader and travel a lot you end up with a sore shoulder from carrying books for the plane trip! No More!!For the last 3 weeks we have been on a boat in the Bahamas, at one point we had to stay in one place for 6 days. In the boat beside us was a woman who had brought 17 books for the trip and was worried about running out --I had to share that I had 27 books all on my little Kindle. She plans to buy two, one for her and one for her father-in-law! Truly a wonderful invention!"
5,Talk of the Office Kindle,"I loved this product so much that I ordered a second one for my daughter. I brought it to the office and downloaded a title in front of my co-workers in less then 10 seconds. They were amazed. What I love is that I now have a permanent library at my fingertips. I'm moving to a more remote area, and the gas savings alone, justify the cost of the product. I look forward to eliminating the piles and piles of books that I keep accumulating. The Kindle makes me ""green"" and provides me with hours of reading entertainment. If I get the urge to read a book I've seen discussed on TV, I can just ""poof"" order it and start it. For the reader, and now getting older, so I can adjust the font as my eyes tire, this is the best of all reading worlds. I don't know what the hip phrase of the day is, but this product is it!"
5,Love my Kindle,"I love my kindle and have now given two others as gifts. One came in damaged but they were quick to replace it, even though it was the holiday season. The books download quickly and the choices for reading are quite good. I have one piece of advice for those who keep the original covers--two small pieces of velcrow on the back of the kinlde to attach to the cover will keep it in place and keep it from slipping out while holding your kindle at an angle."
4,The Kindle is awesome,I love my kindle.. I haven't been into reading for a long time.. BUT I am now. The Kindle makes it so easy to read with the ability to adjust the font size. I also love that when you turn it on it will go to the page you left off at. I strongly suggest this item!!!
5,Kindle,"I am enjoying my Kindle. I just use it for reading books, haven't tried the other services. Sometimes it's hard to hold with the large page turning clicks on each side and it doesn't stay well in it's cover if you're reading. It doesn't get service in Alaska, where I took it for a trip, but the computer download worked well."
1,Dumb Dumb Dumb,What a stupid idea--How do you lend a book to a friend?How do you touch and hold and electronic book--Where are the aesthetics?How do you read a book that's not on the list?Who would want this stupid thing? Why would Amazon invest in this stupid thing?
1,"Amazon please invest in the external design, this is no ipod is more like a Ford Pinto","Amazon please invest in the external design and develop a sleek cool looking product (of course without compromising functionality). This is no ipod. People who liked the looks of the Ford Pinto will definatelly be buying this item. I can tell you, there isn't many of them."
1,Need PDF support,"Upfront, I have not purchased this product. When I first saw it I was excited. I'm a student and have to read hundreds of pages of PDF journal articles each semester. I love books too much to replace them, but I'm open to the idea of digital books for my studies. Anything has to be better than reading off laptop screens. However, this doesn't support PDFs and the wireless network isn't available in my area. In a few generations when they realize the market of students and business people, sign me up. But for now I will continue to read off laptop screens."
2,What about books I already own?,"I can see the potential for this device for newpapers, magazines, bestsellers but what about the library of books I already own? If Amazon can come up with a way for me to transfer my book to the Kindle then I will be all over it!!!"
1,Another screen?,Why on gods green earth would someone want to buy another screened device just to read books! Part of the pleasure of reading is turning pages and not getting headaches from staring at a screen. It also seems incredibly over priced!
2,yet another electronic gadget to carry,"This is another item to carry with you (in case you want to buy this).Imagine having a laptop, a phone, ipod and now a kindle. Why cant it be all in one or just use your laptop to do the same . why pay for another device."
3,Kindle reading device,"This looks like an excellent but partial idea or concept. As a pure ebook it is almost too large. But what makes it seem even less functional and practical is as large as it is there is no multimedia for audio books or MP3 music or educational videos. This also means that lack of great graphics in Kindle severely limit its potential market in the areas of technical literature such as engineering, medicine, architectural, industrial applications just to name a few. At a time when more and smaller are necessary to make the communications age more usable, Kindle take a a very partial step in the right direction at best. But with all the capabilities mentioned, I think it would be an indispensable tool."
4,Great product,"Overall, I love the Kindle. The two issues I have are: not enough of the books listed for sale on Amazon are available, newer books in a series,(mysteries for example), but not the older ones and there isn't a back light inside. The ease of buying and getting the book right away is great."
1,Sprint Means US Only?!?!??!!,"I don't have this product yet but was very interested and ready to buy. Sadly, it's apparently stuck with Sprint and their EVDO (therefore CDMA) network, so it appears it will never work outside of the US. As an international commercial airline pilot, this product would be perfect! But with this poor choice of networks, it's apparently tetherd to the US only. Oh well, there goes many sales."
2,I had to return my Kindle,"I loved the kindle and what it is capable of doing except that the ""next page"" button kept being hit accidentally by either my fingers or something else. It was very frustrating to keep losing my page and having to look for it. I think the next page button on the right side of the machine covers too large of an area and it is in the way. It also goes all the way to the edge, thus increasing the chance of being hit my mistake. I will buy a Kindle once they have redesigned it so one can hold the machine comfortably without worry of hitting the wrong button my mistake."
1,Deal breaker: No support for PDFs or other text documents!,"I have always loved the idea of an e-book reader, and I've been waiting for someone to get it right. When I read that Kindle was announced and had wonderful features like- wireless support- SD card support- PC sync- an online storeI had my credit card ready. But then I realized that it does not support PDFs or other text file formats.What am I going to do with the hundreds of e-books I already own?What if I buy e-books from other vendors and want to read them on this reader?In an age where everyone is moving towards providing an open platform to content creators and consumers, here is a device that will tether me to using its service. And that, for me, is a deal breaker."
1,useless without PDF support,"As a professor and researcher, I'd love to have a product that would allow me to store, carry, read, highlight, and annotate PDF files of peer-reviewed papers. Without PDF, this is entirely useless to me. I have no interest in constantly reformatting PDF to MOBI in order to be able to use it. Please support PDF. Better yet: Dear Apple, please come out with a competing and characteristically graceful variant that also supports PDF. I'll cheerfully be first in line to buy one! I'm usually an Amazon fan, but this non-PDF Kindle is a complete non-starter."
1,Discouraged,"I am sorry to say that the Kindle wasn't all it was advertised to be. I gave it to my husband for his birthday and have already returned it. Why? The design is such that it is almost impossible to hold in a relaxed position without inadvertingly turning the pages. Then once you turn the page-unless you are very careful it is difficult to hit just ""previous"" page. Also, we had several times when it would just freeze up and had to be reset before we could continue-and of course, had to go back to the beginning of the book and once again find our place. I am also sorry it doesn't have a back light. Once improvements are made in the design, I feel it could be a great product. But, for the price and the problems I experienced-I was very dissappointed. Amazon was wonderful in crediting me back after I returned it."
4,Great Product,"I have owned this for nearly a month now and have downloaded three books and I LOVE IT! It's easy to use, easy to read from and convenient to take anywhere. My only complaint is that it's hard sometimes to not push a ""page turn"" while reading because of where those buttons are located."
5,This thing is great!,"I've had it for a week. It's all that it's advertised to be and more. The internet works well. The case is good. The battery life is great. The book samples are awesome. All people who are giving exceptionally low reviews do not have one. Or else they're just technologically incompetent or want the kindle to be a laptop. It's worth $400. By the way, everyone I have showed it too first says, Wow! $400 that's a bit much, but then when they actually use it they say not too bad."
1,Screen defects make Kindle worthless,"I have had my Kindle for slightly more than a year. While I found it useful, it recently developed lines on the screen that make it unreadable. It is slightly beyond the one year warranty period. I was disappointed Amazaon would only offer to replace it with a refurbished model for $180. After spending so much money on the Kindle, I expected it to last for more than one year. I discourage any of my friends from buying a Kindle."
5,Love My Kindle!!,"I absolutely love my kindle!!! It is the best invention since sliced bread!!! I live in Eastern Oregon and don't have a Sprint tower near, closest is 30 miles away. So, I download my books to my laptop and load them into my Kindle. Life has never been so good!"
4,Amazing Kindle,I received my Kindle about 1 1/2 months agao. I have downloaded 6 books and am in the process of reading the last one. It only takes about 5 seconds for the books to be downloaded. I really like everthing about the kindle. I was with my family this Thanksgiving and was showing everyone there how it works and everyone was really impressed. I would recommend the Kindle to anyone.
4,"Good, could be great","I bought the Kindle the first day that it was released and overall am very pleased with the concept, quality, service. That said, it could be much better.Pros:1) Books are reasonably priced and extremely easy to obtain - anytime and anywhere.2) I love the variable type size.3) I love carrying multiple books at a time. Great for browsing!4) Free web browsing for the price of the reader. That's a great thing on the fairly fast Sprint wireless network. Many ""reviewers"" don't understand this great added benefit.Cons:1) Plastic case is smooth and slippery - easy to drop. Needs a rubbery, more tactile feel. Want more rounded edges - better in the hand.2) Needs a backlit source for night/dark-room reading.3) Needs a MUCH more competent web browswer capability. It's downright primitive in its ""experimental"" form.4) Needs a color screen to enhance web browsing and magazine reading.5) Want the ability to wirelessly (wi-fi) print out 1-2 pages."
4,Not exactly everything said to be,"I do love my Kindle, but somethings aren't exactly like advertised. Sometimes downloading a book can take 10 min or longer. Also the battery doesn't last long - even with the wireless turned off. It only last a few hours. Also the ""sync to last page read"" doesn't take you to the last page at all. With those few minor complaints, it really is a great product."
3,"Great concept, but...","I love the concept, but probably won't be an early adopter. Why? Because I don't necessarily want to own every book I read. I'd like to see some sort of NetFlix type subscription service. With the wireless connection it seems like it should be easy to add a ""done"" or ""buy"" option - allowing me to keep a book I really like or go on to the next book in my queue. However, it's probably easier to imagine the technology than it is to work out the economic model."
2,Mobile Library,"The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. If you already have a large book collection, I wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. Besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it? What are you going to do, stare at it?"
3,Poor Coverage,Sprint has extremely poor coverage in Arizona...an alot of other areas too. If this worked on Verizon or AT&T; it would be much more practical.I go to our summer home in Pinetop and can't download papers or books. Same when i am in Sedona.
3,People are Dumb,"Its funny to read comments with people complaining about it not being an ""open"" technology, then saying they cant wait for Apple to make a better one.When i think of apple and iTunes, the term ""open"" does not really come to mind."
4,Near perfection in portable print...,"Kindle knocks me out on an ongoing basis. It's the sort of device we geezers dreamt that a bounteous techno-future would produce. Light but not flimsy, vastly readable, portable as a paperback, and constantly renewable. Just to have a solid book of history on hand to wind down with before bed--not too many breathless escapes or astounding unforseen plot twists to juice you up--I ordered TRUMAN by McCullough. I remember toting the hardcover around when it came out. Even holding it up to read in bed was a workout. It downloaded in a minute and is an engrossing joy again. I change print sizes according to whether or not I'm wearing my glasses, which means switching to bigger type in bed--instantly! I love that it always returns me to my exact place in each book I'm reading. Only drag is the search function, which doesn't allow a search by author--yet. With luck, Kindle will solve that too. A sweet deal!"
5,I Love My Kindle!!!,"I am a person who loves, loves, loves to read and my Kindle gives me much more opportunity to read than I have time to read!!! This is the best gift I have ever gotten. My boss gave me my Kindle for my anniversary at work and I couldn't have been more surprised. I love it, love it, love it!!!"
5,Amazon Kindle,"I received the Kindle two days after I ordered it. It was a gift for my dad for Father's Day and I was worried about receiving it in time, but it came several days earlier than I had dare hope. Packaging was first rate and I was very impressed with both the packaging and fast delivery - particularly as shipping was free! My dad loves the Kindle. He's over 70 and has no problem using it and getting online with it. In fact, when his DSL broadband service was down for a day, the Kindle was his means of getting online and checking the latest news. He has already downloaded several books, and the larger font size option is really an appreciated feature. Thanks, Amazon, for a great product and great service!"
5,An idea,I purchased the Kindle as a gift for my wife as she is a very dedicated reader. She adores it; raves about it; tells friends. I am glad she likes it so much. She gets so entranced with her reading materials on the Kindle that she loses track of time. Why not include an auditory or vibratory alarm that the reader can set? Just a thought.
1,KINDLE SWINDLE,"I paid full price 17 months ago and ebooks were $9.99 for the best sellers. Now, the Kindle is cheaper and the ebooks bestsellers are more expensive. I wouldn't mind paying the higher ebook prices if my Kindle had been $189 but I was one of the first to jump on the wagon at $350.00 Shame on me. I'm back at the library. I'd rather borrow the books than pay $12.99 for a bestseller. I'm a little miffed, obviously. KINDLE SWINDLE they could have given us early purchasers a gift card to lessen the KINDLE SWINDLE damage. That would have been great marketing damage control."
5,Kindle,"The Kindle is extremely easy to use with multiple applications. The ability to select the text size, the convenience of a dictionary at hand and the light weight are just a few of the outstanding features. I am sure I will find many more favorite features."
4,Feather Light,"The only thing wrong with the Kindle is that I hit the forward button too much. However, I think I've found a way to overcome this problem...leave it in its cover, support it with your left hand, and then allow your left hand fingertips to lightly rest on the ""next page"" button. Then when you're ready to turn the page you're already in position. I can use my right hand to steady the Kindle and use the other buttons. I just bought it, so I'm still getting use to handling it. Speaking of handling...it's soooo light! Your hand/arm doesn't get tired holding. It is very user friendly. I only read a few of the directions, and I was off navigating through it. It is totally cool and the books are CHEAP! That is a very big plus. I now buy more books than I have ever done in my life. The free wireless is a huge plus. I probably wouldn't buy so many books if it were not free. I love it and so will you if you love electronics."
4,Love My Kindle,"I thought long and hard before I decided to invest in my Kindle. It tookjust one look around my home and all the stacks of books everywhere thatmade me decide to buy it. So far I love it and it was really great on arecent trip I took. The only thing I have found so far is that for me the cover was a big part when picking out a book to enjoy and sometimes Ifeel like I am reading a ""generic book"" My son joking suggested to printthe cover from amazon.com and stick it on the inside cover of my Kindle.I might just do that! I did have trouble with the Kindle falling out ofthe cover put a couple of sticky Velco strips took care of that."
1,Poor product poor customer service,Purchaces a kendle for xmas - kindle will not hold charge for 8 hours. contacted amazon was told to buy higher priced cover - 10 days later kindle still will not hold charge for 8 hours. Amazon wanted to charge for second Kindle - Now I'm stuck with poor product - then I learn this morning two other people I know here in Omaha also pruchased a kindle they two have the same problem that their kindle will not hold charge and amazon has will fix problem. This is just absolut crap that we have a company ripping people with this poor product.
2,Public Library,I am not happy that you can not get free books from the public library with a kindle. All of the other readers can get free book.
2,Kindle is hard to give as a gift,"Product works OK, not sensational, but is hard to get transferred to a new owner if you're giving it as a gift. I bought a unit to give to my wife, but she's had difficulty getting it into her own name.... just an irritant, something easily solved if anyone at Amazon was paying attention."
2,different carrier,I think Kindle needs to use different carrier. Sprint is limited by the amt of towers. If you live in the country like I do and am 7mi from being able to get the service it is frustrating. I would think ATT would be a better choice. I was very upset when I couldn't get it to work without even having to download book to my computer and sent it back. Also I have not seen anything on your website showing how hard it is to download a book to the computer then load to the Kindle.I don't even know what it's called when you download a book to computer. I think you need specific info on your website.Pat Johnson
4,Love the Kindle,"I have been using my kindle for a little over a month now. I really like being able to read anything I want on demand. I live out in the country and was worried about picking up a signal, but that has not been a problem. The only complaint I have is about holding the device. I frequently hit the page forward button by accident. I guess this is one of those things that takes time getting used to. I enjoy not having books cluttering up the house and saving paper as well. I would highly recommend this product!"
5,Wonderful Device,"I love it, and have probably ""sold"" 5 in the last month because of my enthusiasm. I read it on the beach all summer in a Zip-loc bag. I find the page turning bars easy to use, the Back button marvelous when reading the paper, and the clippings section wonderful for saving quotes for speeches.I can get wireless connectivity in places where my Blackberry doesn't work.I have bought enough books at the reduced rate to almost pay for the device. I find I read faster too, because I click the bar one paragraph from the bottom, anticipating the short pause, and the timing is perfect.Everyone who sees me reading it gets an enthusiastic lesson. Bring on the color version!I'll upgrade!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"The Kindle is really amazing. It does take a bit of getting used to as far as not turning the page when you don't want to, but you quickly get used to it. It's easy to use and doesn't take a lot of setting up before you start reading the book you want. Getting a new book is simple - quick - AMAZING! It eliminates a problem I have . . . where do I keep all my books? With the Kindle - that's not a problem any more!"
5,Good book...only better,"When I ordered my Kindle, I was a little nervous about whether I would miss the feel of real paper pages, but I have found that I enjoy books on my Kindle just as much as ""real books"". Having so many books at my fingertips is the best part of owning a Kindle. I can hear about a book, find it, buy it, and start reading it in a flash! Anybody that loves books would love a Kindle."
4,Love my Kindle,"Never thought I'd be a convert to an electronic reader, but I spend quality time with my Kindle every day. I've also started reading my newspapers on the Kindle and prefer that experience to reading news online, though it's still not as good as the real thing. But saving paper (and money on much cheaper subscriptions) has won out."
4,on off buttons,The Kindle is a wonderful device. I wish that medical journals were available. My one comment is that the on and off buttons would be much better if they were on the top of the device rather than on the back of the device. They are very inconvenient.
2,Too expensive,I think as a concept this is an awesome product. So long as Amazon makes all books available in this format and we don't end up in itunes like wars with NBC where they pull content.Why aren't I buying one? Price. 400 bucks is nuts. I'd have paid a buck more per book. 400 bucks is just too expensive. 100 bucks would be my trigger point.
1,Kindle has no maintenance support from Amazon: Therefore Useless,I love Kindle but I can't use it because Amazon can't seem to manage to send me a replacement power supply with charger and ours is no more. All technology is useless if the vendor can't supply the most simple replacement part. Be afraid. This is a super-techie talking.
1,Damaged Kindle,"The Kindle that I purchased for $400.00 is totally useless. The screen was damaged while carrying the kindle in my backpack and, amazingly, Amazon has absolutely no repairs available. They basically told me that there is nothing to do other than throw this one away and buy another one.Maybe I overlooked thinking about possible repairs, but honestly, who would ever think that Amazon would not be able to repair their own items.$400.00 (or new price now is $359.00) down the drain. Too bad, but I will definitely get $400.00 worth of pleasure retelling this story to my friends."
4,Criticism from a Kindle Lover,"I love my Kindle. Period. Here's is what I'd like improved:1.) The dictionary is a joke. It defines words like ""car"", ""lay"", ""apple"" but ignores words like, well, I need to look up! This is a joke.2.) Agreed: Difficult to handle. Buttons awkward.3.) Need bigger selection!!#1 and #3 can be, thankfully, accomplished without new hardware version. Go for it, Amazon!"
4,Kindle review,"A friend showed me the Kindle in September. I am an avid reader and I'm out of bookshelf space again, so it appealed to me. I'm becoming more aware of the environment, including cutting down trees and petroleum needed to transport items. I still travel (petroleum usage notwithstanding) and usually drag 4-6 books along with me. I got the Kindle in early November and took it on a plane trip. Other than having to turn it off when we were taking off and landing (with longing glances cast at those who had paperback books and could still read!), it was perfect. I read two and a half books on the trip and it only required one two-hour charge of the battery. It's light and easy to handle. It's easy to change the font and VERY easy (thank you, Amazon!) to order from the Kindle store; books really do download in one minute. There are reviews on the Kindle Store website, which are helpful. All books are discounted. I am having to practice great self-restraint, but I do highly recommend it."
5,kindle,I love it!!!!!! So easy to operate and the screen is perfect. I have purchased three extras for friends and family... that should say it all!
1,DON'T BUY,"STRONG DON'T BUY - if you have any problems with your unit, Amazon will tell you ""there is nothing they can do"" ---- no repairs, no replacement parts. High priced unit with no warranty, no help - finding this to be typical of Amazon service of late. DON'T BUY, DON'T BUY, DON'T BUY."
2,So stupid!,"So, I got really excited about this as soon as I saw it. Well, then right before I ordered it, after I had read all the amazing reviews, I saw there's no coverage in two states in the US. I live in one of them. COME ON!!At least get some coverage in Montana! Even Wyoming has coverage! I would have loved this if there was coverage here. But, there isn't. So now, I hate it."
2,I will when...,"Nice idea, and one day I will buy. However, the $399 price is way to steep. I will buy when the screen is color (not for reading the actual material, but for the shopping pages) and when the price is managable, like $50. I assume they will make plenty of profit from downloads and purchases. I am absolutely positive my purchase of reading materials will skyrocket with a product like this. They will make more money off of me than they do now. There will be price drops. Maybe in a couple of years I'll get one. Or maybe not."
1,"Be very, very wary of Kindle outside the US","What a disappointment! I bought a Kindle as a surprise birthday present for my wife. The surprise was on me. The Kindle books, available in 90 seconds via wireless, are not available if you are outside the US. We live in Canada. The website for ordering has State/province, but no provinces are listed. It has Zip/Postal code, but won't accept postal code format. So she has a lovely, useless bit of hardware and software, full of promises but no delivery."
5,my kindle,This has to be one of the best electronic devices I have ever purchased. Plus.....it works as advertised....
4,Highly functional,"I find the Kindle very functional. It's great to have so many reading choices when traveling. But no need for page buttons to extend all the way to the top corners, sometimes in the way. Case/cover was clearly an after thought, because the page buttons go to the top it's very difficulat to keep the case on, too bad; great product but lost a star because of the cheap cover."
5,love it!!,I bought the Kindle one month ago and have to say I love it!! I don't know how I lived without it.
4,Kindle,"Handy, convenient, and easy to use. Comfortable to hold and page buttons are well placed. The only complaint I have is battery life. You must keep network turned off, otherwise you have to recharge daily. Highly reccomend getting a spare battery."
4,My Favorite New Toy,"The Kindle is a useful, addictive device, basically an iPod for books. The snags in it are largely obvious ones that will be ironed out in the next generation; odd button placement, wireless that apparently doesn't work in the state of Alaska, weird file format support, an incomplete library of available titles. But it's a little device that you'll definitely find uses for. Waiting for a ride from the dentist's office? Browse and download the lastest release. Read a book and you can't stop telling people about it? Carry it around and show people, but not in a creepy look-i-have-ten-copies-here-in-my-man-purse way. Best of all, if you want to read texts on how to be a more responsible global citizen, you don't have to purchase a paper copy that was made at a big factory and then shipped across the country. A cool way to go green."
4,Kindle reading device,"I am happy with the convenience of having a small unit for reading. The fact that I order my books on line is easy and time efficient.The only downside is getting used to holding the unit in order to not deploy the advance option before I am ready.I have had limited customer service calls, unfortunately on one of my first calls I reached a person who was not at all helpful, in fact wasted a lot of my time and accomplished nothing, after much frustration I called again and fortunately reached a knowledgeable helpful rep who helped me in seconds."
4,Love it but.....,I love that's it's linked to my amazon account and I love how easy it is to order and even pre order my books. I also love that I can set the type size. However I don't like the location of the page change bars. With the buttons on (both) sides it's hard to pick up or hold without accidently pressing one of them. I nearly sent it back for this reason. Maybe the next generation could have smaller better situated bars and possibly include a backlight for us night readers? The booklight doesn't really stay well with the book cover.
4,Kindle,I love my kindle but the page turn buttons are too easily touched. Hoping the next generation has a better way to hold it for reading.
4,The Kindle--a delight,"We took our new Kindle on an eleven day cruise from Dover, UK to New York. What a joy it was. While the ship's library was a joke, the Kindle was a delight. I'd loaded all of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Thoreau, Sherlock Holmes and a couple of contemporary books as well. What a movable feast that was. The Kindle worked perfectly, faithfully kept my place and more than lived up to its prior billing. The only minor criticism I have: the cover is a bit awkward and didn't hold the Kindle well (a replacement will probably work better though a strip of velcro did the trick on the trip).Bottom line: For the inveterate reader, a joy to behold and to read!"
5,Bravo Amazon.com,"I have had my Kindle for a little over 24 hours now. I ordered one and then cancelled the order because of the inital negative reviews. After reading positive reviews that pointed out most of the negative reviews were from non-owners, I ordered two Kindles. One for me and one as a gift.The Kindle is amazing. I have quickly bonded with it. I love the fact that you feel just like you are reading a book without needing to hold the weight of the book or fiddle turning pages. It works great for newspapers, too. I woke up early this morning and it was a freezing cold day---I read the entire NY Times w/o getting out of bed.Brave Amazon.com! I love your Kindle!"
4,Add pdf support and it's 5 stars,"As a new owner of the Kindle I just love it.-Screen is easy to read, much more comfortable than a pda/laptop/iphone.-I wake up in the morning, grab the Kindle and my newspapers are there ready to read. Amazon whispernet is awsome.-Book selection is deep.-Design is perfect. very comfortable and easy to use. Those that put down the design or looks just have not seen it in person yet.-USB connection to both my PCs and Macs is easy. Plug and play.-Search, bookmarks, and personal notes are far better than the competition offers."
4,Cap'n Tommy's Kindle,"My wife gave me my Kindle for my 70th birthday! I love it, being retired I like to read a lot. The down loads are quick and easy. You have to be careful when handling or give it to someone to lookat. The page buttons are very easy to click. What a great gift. My wife whants to know when the color version is coming, so I can give mine to her! Being a retired airline pilot I love being able to go the great weather site. Weather Underground. Kindle is a trick piece of eltronics."
4,krs,I am really enjoying my Kindle. I have had issues with the battery butAmazon has been great with their help. I will continue to use it and by electronic books!!!
5,Can't live without it.,"Paraphrasing a well-known commercial, I don't leave home without it. Even though I had a little problem with the display itself, the thought of not being able to access my Kindle throws me into a panic. Before I would just stnad in line, trying to not be impatient ... now if I am in line, I just take out my Kindle, and start reading. It is better than my ""regular"" books because sometimes I am in the mood to read something else ... now I don't have to carry several books with me. I also read while I am dining alone and can see if there are any new books I might be interested in. The ability to read a chapter first before I purchase has also led me to read new authors and new genres. Now if only ALL the books were available on Kindle, I would be a happy girl!"
5,Kindle Fun,"The Kindle makes finding books a breeze. I was reluctant to give up books in favor of something ""electronic"", but it really does have the feel of a book. The dictionary and highlighting features are awesome. The only thing I miss are the cover designs of the books I choose. Amazon makes it easy and convenient to download books anywhere. I'm taking a trip this week and will have my Kindle along!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I cant tell you how exciting it is to have a KINDLE! I love to read,when I have time and it makes it soo much easier for me to hold and turn pages with my hands.Tho it sure would be much better if it had a built in light feature!! Just one extra thing to have to haul around or set on my kindle when I am in a dark area to read. ALSO I wish the next page button,on the left side was the BIG button instead of the little button. I find myself pushing that one instead. To me it would just make more since.Thanks to all that participated in making this new reader!! Love it!"
5,Excellent,"I love this item. It is perfect for a person who loves to read and is retired and travels a lot. Wish they had this items years ago and I wouldn't have such a lot of books to store that take up so much spaceLove it, Love it Love it!!!!"
4,Kindle,I really like my Kindle. I am having a little trouble with audiobooks downloading properly [...]. I wish there were more text books available. But over all I am not unhappy
1,Don't buy if you read for more than pleasure,"I am a student and bought this so I could study for exams without hauling books. After only two chapters of the first book I tried to study, the Kindle blocked me from any more highlighting. Since I can't flip through pages on this thing when exams come, the highlighting/clipping function is crucial. It's misrepresentation and false advertising to promote this product as if you could do ""everything"" with it that you would do with a book. After spending twenty dollars on a book I can't use or highlight in, I have to spend another twenty to buy the hardcopy so I can highlight as much as I want. You better believe, I won't be buying it from Amazon.Amazon, no more false advertising. Please let students know that they can't use this device for studying!"
5,"Hated the first few pages, no cost","If you buy books, hate the first chapter and never read the rest, this is for you. The book preview is worth the cost. Download any first section of a book for free. If you like what you read, buy the rest of the book. That's it. You'll love it."
5,JINDLE READING GADGET,This is one of the most outstanding electronic/computer products I have seen in some time. It does everything it says it will do with ease and speed. I really like the light weight and compact size. It's ability to hold so much data is unbelievable. Amazon has really out done themselves producing the Kindle.
4,Almost Returned the Kindle!,"I researched the Kindle before buying it but obviously should have researched more. I bought the Kindle and tried to download books. Much to my surprise, I was unable to download books as Sprint's data network coverage does not include North Dakota. On the Web site it states the service was not available for Montana and Alaska, nothing about North Dakota.Now I am downloading through my computer which works just as good. I look forward to the day when I can use the wireless feature though. Other than that, I love my Kindle and just ordered one for my husband for Christmas and it is on backorder until March 4. Now that was a real disappointment. I would recommend the Kindle to anyone who enjoys readng!"
5,Kindle review,I really like the Kindle. I almost think I read faster using this product. Even those that aren't computer knowledgeable will havean easy time with the Kindle. A few things that I would change would beto move the page turners up a little higher because you don't have enoughroom to hold the kindle without accidently turning the page. Also put theon and off switch on the front. All in all a great product and fun.
4,This time they got it right,I purchased an RCA eBook several years ago. Our local library loaned them out and I was so struck by this device I bought one. Shortly after my purchase the eBook was no longer supported by RCA. Along comes the Kindle and after my purchase I realize the Kindle did a number of things right:1. Being able to buy books with a wireless connection. A definite plus.2. Major price break for Kindle customers. Buy 15-20 books and the Kindle pays for itself.3. Size and weight factor. The RCA eBook is a brick compared to the Kindle.4. Easy access to the battery.My wife and I enjoy our Kindle. Amazon delivered ahead of schedule and we were delighted. Improvements like a touch screen would be nice but there's always v 2.0 just around the corner. Can a trade-in program be in the works?
3,a real page turner,"While I love this device, there are two things that really bother me. One, it is hard to hold without changing the page. The buttons to turn the page are a lot larger than they need to be for convenience. Two, I have never gotten the cover to fit right. The kindle falls out of it every time, without that elastic band around it."
2,BUYER BEWARE! DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT A WARRANTY,"We saved up so we could get a Kindle for our son for his High School Graduation. He LOVED IT!!!! He is always reading and this was the perfect gift. He took it to college and was thrilled when he could get some of his reading material on the Kindle instead of having to buy it from the bookstore. One morning he was reaching over his bed to get something off the floor, and the Kindle was on his bed. He kelt on it and cracked the screen. He had only had it a couple months, and so we checked into the warranty on it. We found out that there is NO WAY TO FIX IT. They told us to hang on to it and if there was ever a way to fix it we could send it in. He is so drepressed aobut it and I am just mad. Considering how many Kindles Amazon has sold you would think they would be able to fix them or at least have some sort of replacement warranty available."
2,Not good for Alaska!,"We hurried and bought two after watching the ""Opra"" show. She made it look so so easy and wonderful. We even rushed the order and were excited to receive them. Both being avid readers we thought this was ideal. We couldn't upload anybooks without using the computer, which was a major pain. To top it off the first five books I wanted to download were NOT available, the same with my husband. It's a great idea but needs work.Back to buying books!"
3,Doesn't work in rural areas,"You MUST download any books/products while you are in a city, because inareas with bad cell service, you cannot purchase/download anything. Twoof our favorite places to relax is a farm in Kansas, and our lake housenear branson, MO. We have not been able to download ANYTHING in theseareas. As long as you are in an area with great cell service, you arefine. Make sure you download EVERYTHING you want before you leave town."
4,"Not Perfect, But I Love This Thing","Yes, there are some ergonomic things that need to be changed -- the page turn buttons are too big so you actually have to learn how to hold it without moving around in the document, and the on/off buttons on the back are a problem (how about along the bottom edge where the volume controls are?).But overall, I love my Kindle. I love how I can try samples of things. I love being able to search the store, wiki and the web at once. I love the periodicals and how they save trees. And I really like having all my important books with me. Good job on how long a battery charge lasts too."
5,Great e-reader,"The Kindle is a great device. I love the ability to get my newspapers delivered overnight, the fact that it remembers my bookmarks for multiple books, the fact that you can expand memory with an SD card, and the long battery life. For travel, it's wonderful, although I wish the airlines would allow me to keep reading when we start our initial descent.Delivery of content is lightening fast and I love being able to download a sample chapter of a book. The ability to change text size is also a great feature for these tired eyes.To sum up: what's not to like?"
1,Have had the Kindle for 6 months--wait for the next iteration,"I've had the Kindle for six months, and have traveled with it. At best, it is adequate. I hope the next iteration will address issues such as: pagination that feels more book like; a ""skimpy"" feel to the plastic housing; awkward and inflexible controls; a not-yet-""natural"" feeling screen; slow page refresh times; too small a reading screen (to feel more ""natural"" I think it needs a bit bigger dimensions, perhaps 1/2 to one inch all around; font flexibility.I'm not traveling now, so I've put it up on the shelf. It is not particularly comfortable for me for ""just reading""."
3,A little too complicated,"A friend who got the Kindle loaned it to me to test drive. I like the device, but I can't say that I truly love it. I own a Sony e-Reader, first generation, that I do love. The Kindle is a little more involved than I care for in regards to an electronic reader. I also have some concerns regarding the wireless applications and security. I will be interested to see what Amazon does with the second generation of this device as well as when the price drops."
2,No coverage!,"You created this incredible leap in technology, which will change the way we read, but you gave it the limited coverage of one declining cell phone company, which has lost the coverage race. I was ready to buy two for my wife and I, until I found it only works in major metropolitan areas, not in our little bit of heaven, we call eastern Washington state.Signed, So Disappointed"
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. Can't get phone service to the Kindle where I live in South Mississippi. Yes, we get service in the big towns but I live 30 miles from the nearest service. We can download a book on the internet from home but we must drive at least 30 miles to have it download on the Kindle. I wouldn't have bought one if I had known this.Jerry CooperColumbia, Ms"
3,An Okay Item,"I found this item sort of hard to navigate. However, there is a forum with a lot of nice people who are willing to help. PDF files have to be send to Amazon to be converted or you can obtain a free conversion program online. Over all, it is a nice item...clear screen, holds many ebooks, nice size."
2,"It's not as great as ""they"" say","There are good things about the Kindle but many negative issues. First, the pictures, drawings, etc. are not good. There is not backlight. Please.... this should be a requirement in this device. To add yet another item you must purchase is ridiculous. Too expensive for what it is. I don't like the ""location"" rather than page reference. Just another difference that isn't needed. All-in-all it is an okay device but will never replace the book. My advice, buy the book."
3,Kindle Use,I would appreciate a WRITTEN user booklet - so that I'm not fighting a Kindle I don't know how to use while trying to learn how to use it.
4,I think it is a wonderful idea,I dont have one..YET. I would love one. Like every new piece of technology... you might have some little minor bumps but I think it is a wonderful idea. I would love to have one... bad thing is that I can not afford it. I am watching the CEO on a TV interview now and I love this product. Hope to get one. I love taking books around with me. If i could take this Kindle with me instead of two or three books... that would be wonderful. Maybe it is not the most beautiful looking items but it is a wonderful idea. thanks.
1,Kindle,Print is too small. I have macular degeneration and it's hard to read. I tried to delete the order but was unsuccessful.
3,Less Books is that Good?,"Finally got the kindle last week. I was excited about it till I realized I wouldn't be able to do the crosswords or sudoko from the papers. Ok, I can get by then I bought a book and everytime I moved I would hit the previous page tab...and back it would go...I guess until I get used to this... this is going to happen over and over again..."
1,Is there or isn't there a new Kindle coming out. What is the HUSH?,"I am cautious of buying this thing as there have been many sidebars on it. Are they or are they not coming out with a new version. I don't want to buy it and the next day the IMPROVED version comes out. The Kindle folks while nice, just say get on the waiting list. Any thoughts? thanks...jim"
1,"Hello, America. This is the world calling ...","Someone should break it gently to the directors of Amazon that there is a whole world beyond the United States. People in the US may or may not be buying Kindle. People in Europe are buying the Sony e-book because it is available and Kindle isn't. By the time they finally get around to rolling it out, they will probably have already lost the battle."
1,Purchased a Kindle & won't work in Canada!! Weren't told!!!!,I think the Ceo On Oprah really mislead the audience.Why would he havenot said US only??
3,kindle library?,"Looks very interesting but I would like a projection of where the library is going. I see Joyce and Melville but no Nabokov. Kerouac but not Burroughs. No Laxness, Saramago. One only Sebald.I am not interested in today's bestseller list."
3,Good - Could have been great,"The Kindle is easy to use, and that's the main thing, isn't it? There are many titles available, and many of them free. Search for ""free kindle books"" and you will find all the classics - all of them totally free. One might think though, for $360 they might have taken care of a few details to get from good to great. Why not add a backlight so we can easily read in the dark? The screen area is small - how much battery is necessary to backlight the page? And the cover. Please. Bezos, did you actually try this thing before you signed off on it? I doubt it. Just throw it right in the trash and order a 3rd party one. Best advice: wait for version 2.0 - hopefully they will iron out the kinks, and find a way to reduce the $360 cost. If you just can't wait though, go ahead - you won't be terribly sorry."
2,Lousy Design,Purchased the kindle and used for 28 days and returned it. Already own a Sony ereader and like it much better. The page forward and back buttons on the kindle are too easily activated and are a nuisance. Would be interested in buying a kindle at a later date after they redesign the buttons. Also if you want the kindle to read newspapers or magazines - the format is horrible.
4,This thing is great and endless book,Oh my god I bought the kindle a few months back becaks my boyfrined and I are plaining on talk a long two day trip down to fl. I got it because I wanted somthoing to read and this just seemed like such a cool idea. I love getting the samples of the book I buy the book it really gives me a good idea of the book beofre I perches it. The only porblem I have is that alot of the books I might want to read arn't on the kindle store yet I'm hopinh weith time after I've rerad the book that you do have that I want to that the kindle libary will have grown I would higly recomend this porduct to anyone who love books
1,Don't bother if you want is soon,"Very disappointed in the customer service aspect. Ordered it over a week ago and it was noted that the device was ""in stock"" when ordered. Here I am a week later and still no Kindle. I should have stayed with my local Borders."
3,Sugestions for design,"My Sugestion? Improve the design!!Simple: I will buy this device when you give me 2 pages to read.I mean, make it like a regular book: when you open it, you see two pages to read... also, the page shown in this Kindle's too small, make it like a regular page of a book.Why this: simple again, because I dont want to spend more time turning pages than reading!!. When you read a regular book, every time you turn a page you lost concentration, if the page is too small (and this is the case with Kindle and other e-readers) you can't enjoy the reading, you can't immerse yourself in the reading!!. Make two screens, one for each page. More expensive? Maybe, but that's the way it should be done!"
3,"Rest in Peace, Kindle","This was a really great idea. Expensive, and out of the reach of many, but still fantastic.Today, Kindle died.Apple's iPad is far more effective at providing a user-friendly full-color and multimedia experience for browsing books, magazines and news.I'm very excited to buy an iPad once it comes to Canada, where I live!"
3,very handy!,"The Knidle is very handy, great for traveling. The only downside is books with pictures."
3,kindle,"I think this product has great potential....but missing a few features.I was reading a book that referenced pictures and tables on specific pages. I couldn't search them because there is no way to know which page you are on, nor how to move to a specific page...couldn't search picture or table references either. This product is limited to novels the way it is, not reference or text books.The other feature which would be nice would be text that lights up against a black background for night reading.....or on a plane with limited light. I like the ease of reading the text as it is during daylight....but a button that switches it over for night reading would be awesome!"
2,probably good if you live in a metropolitan area,"I returned my Kindle. What they don't tell you is that in order for the downloads to work you have to be in an area where Sprint has EVDO service otherwise you need to purchase books on line, download to the computer, and then transfer to the Kindle. I'm fairly computer proficient, but loading the book I purchased never did work. Also, per their tech support, many on the features such as newspapers, email, etc. will only work in the Sprint EVDO areas and cannot be accessed any other way. Sprint doesn't service our area although we have great EVDO service from Alltel and AT&T locally. The closest Sprint EVDO service per tech support is 125 miles away. I'll continue to read the old fashioned media until someone comes out with a system that will operate on a wider choice of networks. This was not worth the price."
3,NO BACK DROP LIGHTING,"I have owned my Kindle for a couple months now and was totally disappointed with the fact that there is no light for the screen. You actually have to have a book light attached to your Kindle to read in the dark. If it weren't for this small inconvience, I would be totally in love with my Kindle."
4,Best eBook Reader Yet,"I travel a lot and thus end up buying a lot of expensive and space-consuming airport paperbacks. Kindle is providing hardback books at paperback prices, meaning I can now read more recent books not yet out in paperback. Had a Rocket eBook a few years ago and liked it except for the book prices (but Reader's Digest who owned it killed the service).Best feature is the wireless connectivity provided with no service fee. This pretty much justifies the high price of the unit.My only real gripe is content. Started reading a series of novels, but found that only the first and third book are available, not the second..."
5,Kindle,Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceI love it. After seeing it several of my neighbors have also purchased the kindle.Only suggestion I would make is to put the on/off switch in front not in back. It makes it difficult to turn off/on when in the case.
4,"Great, but . . .","I bought a Kindle for my mother, who needs larger type to read easily. It works great for that, and it is simple enough to use that she can master it. Except, of course, that she keeps turning pages inadvertently. I do too, when I use it. Please, in the next version, get rid of the redundant right-hand page turner.I was also disappointed to learn that I live in one of those large areas of the country in which you cannot get wireless service (the upper peninsula of Michigan). I'm hoping for an expansion of service, even though I can download books on my computer."
2,Less than perfect,"I purchased two Kindles, one for myself and one for my husband.And guess what? The coverage map (when I entered my zip code) indicated that there was wireless coverage where I live. It turns out that there is no coverage IN MY WHOLE STATE!!! Sprint coverage, at best, is extremely spotty except in high population areas.Major bummer.And, to add insult to injury, I can't download the free samples of books to my computer, only directly to the Kindle.Please Amazon/Kindle, fix these problems!"
4,Best device ever for readers!,"I love it! 2 drawbacks. I would like the on switch on the front, and it is too easy to turn the page. I think the bar should not extend all the way to the top. I would also like an easier way to find my place. Any suggestions are welcome. Helen"
4,John's Kindle,"Overall, I am delighted with this product and have enjoyed telling and showing many others of it. I am certain that a good number of my friends and associates have also purchased Kindles, based upon my enthusiam and recommendations.From a design standpoint, accessing the on/off button while retaining the Kindle in the portfolio holder is awkward, and often allows it to slip out of the holder. Also the elastic band, if used to secure the front cover of the binder (behind the Kindle) while reading tends to loose its elasticity.Finally, the holder periodically causes the back plasic battery compartment cover of the Kindle to become disengaged from the Kindle.Dispite these engineering issues, I very much enjoy the functionality of the Kindle."
1,"can I give it ""zero"" star?",why would anyone buy this? you can't see pictures or graphs. it won't hold a charge more than a day.
3,iPhone is a tough act to follow,"This is a great device in so many ways, but it is years behind modern designs like the iPhone and iPod Touch. And so many people are complaining about the looks, ergonomics and case quality. I am really surprised that this is the design Amazon decided to release. It really does look like a portable 8-track or Soviet-era rocket launcher control.Still, I think this is a great concept and that it will be a big success. I expect others, like Apple, Sony and Microsoft, will jump in and provide a lot of competition. This will spur Amazon to really complete their product and all that will be very good for all of us. Hurry up!"
2,Black & White Screen is the deal killer,"The 4-level greyscale screen is a killer in my opinion. I can get color pictures & graphs in USA Today, etc., which makes digesting the news easier. Even the NYT uses color occassionally. This seems like a step backwards."
1,Back Light Needed,"I have not purchased this product, however, I did purchase another brand and returned it the same day.I read books on my Palm. You need a backlight to prevent eyestrain or simply to read in a dark room.I am hoping that all makers of this type of product will ""see the light"" and start making them with the backlight."
1,missed Christmas without warning,"I ordered this on 12/12 and was not given any indication at the time that the order wouldn't arrive in time for Christmas. It's now too late to buy a different gift (i fly out on Sunday), and I was never informed of this delay. I am only finding out now by going to the website to check out the status of my shipment. All in all a horrendous way to treat a customer spending several hundred dollars!!!!"
4,Great Gadget Beautifully Packaged,"Kindle does everything it promised. Hoping for a wider selection of material in the future, and for people like me with poor eyesight I hope the menus and online material will someday be in large print. The downloaded material is very readable."
5,No more hunting,No more hunting for a book. I have already used this for my childrens book reports and used the features to save and bookmark. I would recommend this for anyone who loves to read constantly.
3,Beware...,"Beware - when I read all the hype for this, I felt that Amazon made it sound like the newspapers came for free with quotes like ""No monthly wireless bills, service plans, or commitments"" - You DO have to buy ALL your content. Yes, you can use the USB cable to upload to the device, but even sending it an email costs money... Oh well - I wish I could afford it."
1,What a Waste of Money,This thing is a joke. it looks like it came from the 80s and the picture sucks. black and white? COME ON!!! its 2007 and it cost 400 bucks! I was angry after i used this for a day. I HATE IT! What a complete JOKE!
1,Ecchhhhhh!,"Call me old fashioned, but I like REAL BOOKS - not ""Beam me up Gone With The Wind, Scottie."" Some things just shouldn't be high tech. Having every moron in the universe able to email me is bad enough. I fart in your general direction!"
1,Price is insane!,"Great product idea- Sony's Reader is similar. Until the prices of these things comes down to earth, I can't imagine many people buying them. Come on Jeff- think of all the books you can sell getting these machines into distribution."
2,A major flaw with all these readers,"I like to write in the margine. It would be nice to type in the margin. Even better, to access all my notes from a menu."
4,Suggestions for improvements,"The Kindle is amazing. Easy to use, and the lookup and highlight features are a real plus.Handholding is a little difficult, the switches on the right hand side should be shorter so you don't accidentally press the back button when reading.The on and off switch should be on the front of the kindle, it would be much easier to use when the book cover is being used."
4,Very Happy with My Kindle,"I read quite a bit - mostly on the train to pass the time on the commute. I was very interested in the Kindle to keep the growing mound of paperback books in my home office under control. I have to say, I thought about it quite a bit, but went ahead and got it. I'm glad I did.The screen is great - not paper white, but very nice. The Kindle Store is wonderful and being able to get first-run books at paperback prices is a Big win for me. The battery life with the wireless turned off is OK, I don't use it that much for connectivity - mostly just reading.With the addition of a 4GB SD card, I should be able to hold several thousand books on this guy. That's a real benefit to me. Highly recommended."
4,Kindle font options is limited.,"I love my kindle very much, but am a little frustrated with the limited options on the fonts, I'd need it to go one more size up for comfort reading, yes, can still read, but a bit straining on the eyes.Also no back lights on the product, if I was riding in the car or bus late at night on a trip, i can't read kindle without having to use a secondary item to do so."
3,Good item - needs work,"I read alot and was therefore very excited to get Kindle as a gift. I was soon disappointed. The device arrived packaged beautifully and was a treat to open. Kindle takes some time to get used to, some of the buttons are odd, the scrolling device is strange. As is the menu features.Most of the books I read are not available for Kindle, also I did not realize how annoying it would be to read a magazine or newspaper on the Kindle. It reads like one long word document. The book are slightly easier to read because the text appears on the Kindle almost like it is in the book.I returned my Kindle."
3,Tough to hold on to,"Kindle is great for the avid reader with space and dollar savings over time. Changeable type size is great. Problems: Kindle doesn't want to stay in case. Tab in case to hook on back of Kindle is not most efficient and back cover of Kindle itself tends to slip off. You also have to develop a strategy for holding the Kindle. Almost entire right-front of unit is a ""page forward."" Almost entire left-front is ""back page"" and ""next page"" buttons. I spend some time getting to the current page because of pressing these buttons while just trying to hold and read."
1,Hate.,"I hate the kindle so much that sometime i want to throw it against the wall and watch catch on fire. Then, I would laugh. I would laugh very loud."
1,Save your money,I have ordered and paid for a download that did not transfer. When I talked to the tech support they had no other help than requesting I be patient. Twelve hours later there is still no download. I feel like I was defrauded out of $400.00. Don't buy this item without knowing that it is totally unreliable.
3,Long way to go,"Seems to be a good idea, but has a long way to go. The biggest issue is the price. A lot of people won't read books if you give them away. But look at movie rentals. If you charged your fee for the reader, then had a reasonable flat monthly fee for the downloads, your idea would be much more profitable. Netflix is < $20 per month for all the movies you care to see. This should be similar to really be worth the money and to get real consumer response."
3,What about colors?,"Why is it black and white? If I read a newspaper I want to see color pictures in 2008 - and if I browse books I want to see colorful covers.Kindle is a nice idea, but somehow it looks like a prototype in many ways... the keys at the bottom always remind you that it's not a book but some kind of cell phone. But if it's some kind of cell phone, wouldn't it be nice if you could use it as one (optionally)? At least it would be good if you could use it to write e-mails and SMS messages.Wouldn't a touch screen like you have it at your iphone make much more sense then this ""Newton""-like buttons everywhere? Last but not least I would feel better if it would have a top side, like a notebook. It would look more like a book that way, and you would be able to see two sides at a time. This would be also useful for special features - one can be used to fade in options like the dictionary."
3,Text to Speech?,I'm awaiting a Kindle to try it hands on. But is there any text-to-speech option for people with print-related disabilities (or just tired eyes)??
4,Can't wait till I get one!,"I can't wait until I get one of these, but what is keeping me waiting, is the price! Help me out Amazon! We're good friends =) Aren't we?"
2,"One word: PDF, PDF, PDF","Almost anyone who uses a computer frequently for work and is serious about getting work done efficiently uses PDF extensively. PDF has become the de facto standard, its use is becoming more common, and there is nothing on the horizon to replace it.To design Kindle to be incompatible with Kindle is a show-stopper. Until Kindle is able to support PDF so that users can seemlessly use the product in conjunction with their established working procedures with PDF, it will be all but useless.Although Amazon has reasons to exclude PDF from Kindle, some of which are nearly impossible to overcome - such as document copyright security - perhaps, sometime, the designers of Kindle will recognize the urgency of the need to overcome the PDF issue nonetheless, and find a way.Until then, Kindle is merely a gimmick, with only limited serious application.Dan N"
3,Will wait for...,"Great concept, but will wait for the following before buying, buy will buy when the product gets there.(no particular order)1. Color (nice to have)2. PDF and other file format support3. $199 price point4. Putting more than one on an account; one for me and the wife to share titles5. Reconcile subscription issues for newspapers; I already pay for an online and print subsciption to the Wall Street Journal for instance which is less than the Kindle pricing"
3,EBooks - getting closer,"I have a eBook reader but it is limited by not allowing PDF books just like this device. What I do like is the ability to read eBooks AND Audiobooks which this device claims to be able to do. I download 24 - 40 audiobooks every year along with 50+ books from Amazon. So this device could be useful to me to limit having to pay for shipping and storage of the books and having a MP3 player for the audiobooks. But this device is costly and I am getting eBooks from other sources for $2 - $6 each. Some books are more costly but I will not buy them.I do have a problem with books as they require storage space and if anyone moves frequently, you quickly know how much a box of books can result in backaches. So if anyone can get the eBook technology right, I will donate all my books to the local library who in turn will probably send them to the local recycle center."
2,After buying thousands of dollars worth of books ...,"I have not used a kindle, but after buying thosands of dollars worth of books, I am insulted that I am being asked to buy this from amazon. I have bought several hundred books, most of which I have highly annotated.Give me one or show me the benefit of laying out $400 when I will continue to buy books."
2,Price Blows the Sale,"I'm sorry, but $400 is to much to pay to have ""the latest thing"". I'm not a Kindle owner and probably won't be. Not at that price, then have to pay for the book too? Not that much, granted, but, no matter how I slice it, $400 is TOO MUCH MONEY!"
1,"problems, problems, problems","Have had three of these to date. My third one just died. I treat them with care. On two, the screen has gone out; one the hard drive died. I am at a year and 4 months. Since my original kindle was ordered over a year ago, I just had to pay $190 for a replacement. I have no faith this will ever be a durable device."
3,Almost Perfect.,Well after 3 1/2 months I like my kindle 1. Like anything it has it's pros and cons. Pros to me are as follows1) The fast and easy downloads of reading materials.2) The portability and convenience of having a reading device handy especially at work for reference books and PDF's.3) The SD slot.4) Battery Life.Cons1) No backlight2) No way to organize your books categories and or folders.3) Slow page turning4) Button issues (layout)5) some books contents page outline different from actual page.6) Not easy to Import PDF's and other reading formats.But over all the Kindle come in handy in long lines and waiting while wife is on shopping sprees.Have heard Kindle 2 is not that great of improvement. Maybe someday improvements and dollar value will match.
4,Way better than I'd hoped,"LOVE my Kindle! I'm reading and enjoying reading more. If you travel a lot - like I do - it is an unbelievably fabulous tool! Very easy to use out of the box - and great for people with arthritis in their hands as it's so light and easy to turn pages. EVERY book does not translate well to the Kindle version -- for example graphics and maps are difficult to view - so if those are integral to the book it may be better to buy the old hard copy. And it can be a challenge to flip quickly back and forth through large sections of material -- like you do with a reference work. However this is somewhat mitigated by the search feature. These two comments aside, I absolutely love it and am very satified. I use and enjoy the built-in dictionary and really am reading more than I ever have. I'm hooked and highly recommend. It will get 5 stars when the display adds color and when it does a better job with illustrations."
3,Quality not controlled,I had the early Rocket Book. It was very well made and had a battery that would not quit. Eventually it became impossible to get current books for it. It was very well made though and was back lit. This was appreciated on many red eye flights with a darkened cabin.Now the Kindle. Overall I like it. The way it retrieves books so quickly and seamlessly is excellent. It is made in China and if feels that way. It is cheaply made and raises durability issues. The leather cover really does not fit. The on and off switch is poorly placed and will certainly fail early as it is so cheaply done. There is no back light. THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL. It goes down just by sitting (with the Sprint connection off). I started a book 3 hours ago and I am already at half battery.This is a first class idea with mediocre execution.
1,Restocking fee for defective product should be a crime.,"When you buy a product you really feel that the company will stand behind it and make you feel good about buying it. When that product turns out to be defective by design you feel bad but you can always return it. Sure you can return it and get charged for being part of the R&D department for Amazon. I think it adds injury to insult to charge a loyal customer for returning a defective product. The charge is $79.99, not a small fee. The Kindle is expensive to start with and then to have to pay to return a product that should not have been released until they worked out their issues that really sucks. I really enjoyed the kindle, sure their were some changes I would have made but it worked. Now would I try to buy another one after they worked out their bugs. HELL NO!!!!!"
4,"Reader, Writer Publisher Reviews A Kindle Briefly","Length:: 2:57 MinsHi everybody! I was able to interview Kim Greenblatt. He is a reader, writer and publisher. Here is a very unpolished brief video review of theKindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device, and his tax help book,Bad Tax Idea, Good Tax Idea. Part of the proceeds of all his books go to Rett Syndrome Research. Thanks for your time.-Francis"
4,Wonderful,"The reading experience is terrific; screen is perfect for reading. I would prefer single recessed forward and previous buttons (and also a back) rather than current design, but I have gotten used to the interface.I subscribe to the Seattle Times and have purchased books; all seamless and excellent. My wife wishes the latest Harry Potter was on it (we had it in hard cover) since it would be nice to search for a name when one wonders on page xxx ""who was this person again?"".I love that I have the paper every morning without the paper. Always hated the waste."
4,amazing,"I purchased the Kindle for my 91 year old mother who has always loved books and reads at least one a week. Her eyesight is failing so the ability to increase the font size will allow her to continue her love of books. She was intimidated with it at first, thinking it was a computer and she would not be able to understand how to use it but after a few minutes of instruction she was reading her first book on Kindle. She has no problems with it at all and I thank Amazon for creating it. Now, if I had one for myself..........."
2,Too expensive,"It's a cool product, but sadly too expensive if compared to competitive products. Amazons' advantage is that they have a great consumer base and even a better marketing platform, so I'm convinced the Kindle will be a great success. Let's hope they use this success to create a more reasonable price :)"
3,"Cost, Cost, Cost","I would love to have a Kindle, as I read voraciously and it would sure beat a lot of trips to the library - having almost instant access to books is a huge plus for me! Still, the cost of $400 for a device just to read (when I can get the books and read without it) is a huge turn-off. If this device is really aimed at being more than a niche product, the price will need to be much lower. I can justify spending the same amount on an Iphone which has multiple useful functions much more easily. I look forward to the time when this item is much less costly and I will be happy to get one. In the meantime, I will stick to hard copies."
2,Non owner hesitates,"I've been a fan of ebooks since they started coming out. I have multiple ereaders on my PDA and keep quite a library in my pocket.I've read all the negative and positive comments. All that aside, I just can't see paying $400 for this thing, especially since it locks me into Amazon."
1,what a rip off,"theyve got to be kidding, you can get a complete pda or something that runs windows mobile for cheaper. why would anyone pay that price for a simple ebook reader with afew extra features when you can get a complete os and be able to do way more for cheaper. ill wait a year when it hits the bargin bin for 99 bucks. as i think its not worth more then 150."
1,Design?,"I agree with the folks who said they'd like a device to replace laptops, not to replace paperback books which are smaller, lighter and last longer than the batteries in a Kindle. I like gadgets as much as anyone but this one is just so, well, boxy and clunky-looking. It surprises me that most decision-makers still don't 'get' the appeal of Apple design which is minimalist and clean, and appeals to the majority of consumers. This poor Kindle thing is just plain ugly. (How sad and dated it would look if placed next to, say, an i-Phone.) On the up side, all the complaints should be very helpful to the next generation of this thing, if there is one."
1,Don't drop that baby!,"I love my kindle - or I did, until my wife dropped it. Dropped, as in slipped out of a 5' tall woman's hand unto a thick carpet.... and it broke. Well, no biggy, right, I've only had it a few months, still under warranty - WRONG!- I'm not sure what 'ordinary use' is supposed to be, but don't ever knock that baby off the coffee table. It has many abilities a paper back doesn't but a paper-back won't cost you $400 and then DIE. I've dropped PDAs and cell phones (maybe I'm clumsy?) but they tolerate normal human flaws. Amazon can down load the log from your Kindle, btw... perhaps they'll target slow readers?At any rate, until they offer replacement insurance or spell out that it is too bad so sad, caveat emptor, or maybe caveat lector, I think I'll buy paper."
1,kindle sucks,"Ordered this for my husband, an avid book, buyer, reader. He could not download books onto it. He ended up calling the company, and was told to go to ""higher ground"" so the signal could reach him. After driving for miles, no go. Called the company back and was told he could ""hook it to your computer"" and get them downloaded that was. That's not how it was advertised--it said you could download the wirelessly. What a joke. I send it back . Keep in mind the price then was over $4oo., I believe, and perhaps improvements have been made, but they said ""download books wirelessly from anywhere""."
3,Kindle Review,"Although I just started using the Kindle, its clear that I will not be able to use many of its features such as newspaper and blog subscriptions. I live in a suburb of New York and yet am unable to get connected at home. In addition, I just came back from Nassau, the Bahamas and there was no connectivity there as well.So that leaves only books which I haven't read any as yet. One other recommendation if I may; on the right side the next page is a large button and on the left it is the smaller of the two. I would have preferred the next page button to be on top of the previous page button on the left.thank you"
2,Not happy with the construction.,"The concept is great however, it is very hard to hold without hitting next page or previous page. More thought should be put into the construction."
5,I love It!!!,"I enjoy my kindle so much! I'm not a big gadget person but this one I love. It makes reading a joy, no book to hold or fall out of your lap, it's compact and when I'm done I just look to see what book I want next. I and my husband bought one for each of us with the $50.00 off promo, we could hardly wait to get them. Happy Anniversary and Merry christmas to us!!!!"
1,High tech solution for a low tech problem,"Buttons placed so that it is too easy to accidently turn pages... My screen has gone black, and no response from Amazon tech service... Dest not work in Alaska nor Wyoming... Just carry a book onto the plane -- at least they cannot make you turn it off."
1,title selection extremely limited,"If you travel a lot and are only looking for bestsellers then this product might be for you. Searching for major titles that aren't recent bestsellers (Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, The Razor's Edge...) I found 10 out of 10 not available for kindle. When browsing by subject I found the selection horrible. Less than ten titles on running! Hopefully this device won't affect the publishing world at all. I would hate to find my reading limited to the choices here!"
1,*** BEWARE***Can't get what you want on your Kindle,"I am an avid reader. I was beside myself when I heard about the Kindle. I got one for Christmas and yes, it is amazing and easy to use. THE BIG PROBLEM became apparent when I realized that not everything is available in Kindle format - like the new Grisham or Evanovich for example. I thought I was going to save a ton of money (and space)because I wasn't going to be buying all those new releases. I was totally ignorant with my assumption that I could read any and everything on my Kindle. And try to get older books for your Kindle - can't be done."
1,The dumbness of Kindle,"I guess there are too many things going on in the world for anyone to notice what a really stupid idea this is:It needs batteries and runs electronically. That means it can (and will and some point) crash. Now you'll never know if he gets the girl in the end.Books never crash, and never need re-charging.You can't underline the Kindle and write in the margins.Damn thing costs $400.It's still easier to flip pages in a book and find the passage you need to re-read.It matters less how many books you get through. What matters is how many books get through to you.Books smell. They smell like books. This is important.You can't stick your gas bill and to-do list in the back of a Kindle.You can drop a book, and it might break the spine, but the book will still be readable."
1,Why?,"Got the kindle, nice and all, yes, BUT I cant use it! Why? Because I don't have a USA registered credit card, and the system doesn't accept outside the USA billing addresses, although Amazon does, and although I have purchased the kindle with a non US credit card. I even called customer service and Kindle Support, got the answer: ""There is nothing we can do about it"". So, Amazon, I have one question for you: WHY did you sell the Kindle to me initially, having me pay hundreds of dollars, accepting a non US registered credit card, if I am not to be able to buy books for it? What to do with it now? To look at it, and say: Oh, it's nice, I have a kindle! That's redicilous and you should have thought about that, so fix that soon and add ""country"" in the one click settings, as far as the billing address is concerned. Otherwise, refund my money to my UK registered credit card, plus the shipping cost for me to send it back to you."
1,Did Anyone at Amazon Try This Out?,"I gave my father a Kindle today. He powered it up. He read the introductory screen. He read that the battery charge indicator on the bottom of the device should be lit. He turned the device over to check, accidentally pressing several buttons on the front in doing so. When he turned the device over, the screen was in a curious state that he could not decipher because instructions on its use had disappeared. The machine is now completely unusable. Never has a piece of equipment rendered itself inoperable in such a short time."
3,"Nice, but missing a key use-case","As a software engineer & product manager I am frequently carrying more than one technical book in my backpack. I consider e-books from the perspective of freeing me from lugging heavy books and not having *the* book I need at the moment. Near as I can tell, O'Reilly, Wrox, etc. don't support the Kindle -- without that, the Kindle doesn't meet my needs. Period."
2,Hard to use for physically challanged folks,"The basic concept of the Kindle is great. I love being able to have several books @ one time in the device (I read several series of authors' books concurrently) and getting them quickly without connecting to a computer is a big plus.Where the Kindle (and most of the competition) fails is in book navigation. When your fine motor skills are impaired, even a large tab like the Kindle is hard to control. This is the one thing I like about the MacAir. Gestures on a large pad (or the screen a la the iPhone) make it a lot easier to move within an item. My hope is the next generation of the Kindle has some sort of feature like this."
3,Looks like a bible,It looks like a bible. I am not religious and I am uncomfortable carrying it around in public. The cover needs some skins or possibly different colored covers. The button issues are well known and I too concur.
2,No PDF support limits usefulness,"Most of my professional reading consists of PDFs. If only Kindle supported them. The thought of being able to read PDFs without hauling my laptop around is wonderful. Alas, disappointment!"
2,waiting for Kindle #2,"I am sorry to say that i sent my kindle back mosty due to the frustration of constantly touching a wrong key on the side. The keys for locating different pages, chapters,etc., are placed in such a way that it is difficult to avoid hitting them by mistake.I am looking forward to the new version of Kindle which I am sure will correct this problem.mizterij"
3,"Good, but overrated","Better than the Sony eBook by far. But, a bit overrated for the price. I bought mine refurbished, which is just as good. The next button is a bit annoying as it does get pressed accidentally and you would have to page back where you left off. Features is very good, but could use more administrative tools, such as the ability to remove all bookmarks as oppose to deleting each one. The web is similar to the 1st generation cell phones, which most are HTML based now. Should've been HTML based since the technology was there. But, the cost would've probably costed over $1,000. The online service, which is free by the way is good for something quick to search, such as books. Don't be surprised when Amazon starts charging to use the wireless feature in the future. Overall, good unit, better then the Sony eBook, clear view. But, a bit over-priced still. Would recommend."
2,Kindle unstable,"The software appears to be buggy. Frequent lockups that require me to remove the back and reboot using paper clip.Also, need to shrink size of right side buttons. To many inadvertent page turns. Also missing a lot of classics. eg No Pearl S. Buck"
2,"so far, no good","I received my Kindle as a Christmas gift and have had frustration with it since then. Despite that I live in a strong whispernet area, I cannot transfer items because of lack of connectivity, even when all the bars are full.A book I purchased literally disappeared and even the support tech had no idea what is going on with my unit. And now I have to wait up to a week to have technical support contact me.I asked for this device because I am a voracious reader and thought it would be great to just have a book to read in a snap instead of driving to the book store when I could find the time. So far, I am very disappointed and frustrated and am wanting my husbands money back."
4,kINDLE WIRELESS READER,"I love this item-it is light and easy to take anywhere with you-it is easy to hold-there are only 2 reasons I don't give it 5 stars-the battery does not hold a charge for a week as advertised even with the wireless aspect off. The other thing is if you want to read a new release you have to wait a few weeks to get the price to $9.99-not all titles are $9.99. A recent release was over $23.00, and I had to wait 2 weeks for the price to drop. This is a great item to have for a traveller, as you can take several books with you without the weight."
3,Two defective Kindles,"I loved my Kindle for the first few months and I think they are wonderful. But, despite the fact that I took very good care of it; it broke after about three months. I was willing to forgive that..stuff happens. And, they were very nice and sent a new one almost the next day despite the fact that it was a few days before Christmas.However, now, two weeks later my new Kindle has stopped working and I wonder if the defect is in the design.Of course, both times it broke I was engrossed in the book I was reading. I'm glad i didn't depend on it for my periodicals.****I am adding this a few weeks after I received my new kindle. I use my computer to watch videos and web TV. The kindle was often on the same table as the laser mouse and I may have used it as a mouse pad. I didn't see a warning but suspect it may have caused the problem. If so I would add a few stars to my review."
4,Indispensable at the nail salon!,"So I think I've found the ""killer app"" for the Kindle: reading at the nail salon. Since you don't have to turn pages, and you can use the side of your palm to advance the book, it makes the logistics of reading much easier! No more wet pages, no more messed up manicure.Now if I can just find a way to beach-proof the Kindle, I'll be all set. So far, I'm too worried about sand getting in it to take it with me.Finally, I wish Apple would get a hold of the Kindle and do some redesign. I use the Kindle on my train/subway commute, and I always seem to be accidentally advancing or backing up pages as the train/subway bumps along."
3,I love this device: BUT,"The device worked perfectly and I absolutely fell in love with it - until the power supply went, 1 week into ownership. Only to find out that I cannot buy another. I had to purchase one from a 3rd party.Support appears to be abysmal as well. I wonder if Amazon shouldn't stick to selling books and partner with Apple to provide the consumer electronics and the subscription serice to Amazon content...."
4,I Love My Kindle,"I love my Kindle but I'm not going to go into detail since so many have already done so. The only thing I will mention is that many say they are accidentally turning pages. Despite all the photos, the kindle is meant to be used with the cover and I have never accidentally turned a page. The only thing I don't like about it is that I'm a fast reader so I'm constantly clicking the next page button. I've made the font the smallest so I have more words on the page but I do wish the screen was bigger. Honestly, I haven't bought many books from the store since there are so many free ebooks out there and I love that I can just put them on myself or email them to my kindle. I see myself using this for a long time. And for all those people who don't have a kindle and write negative reviews, get a life. If you think it's useless or too expensive, then don't get one. Very simple."
4,Faster than they said,"Just finally received my kindle. Still getting used to it. I keep hitting the next and last page buttons when I shouldn't. That will take some getting training on my part. I downloaded 2 books, and was amazed at how fast they loaded, and I was on the alternate network (had ""1x"" above the bars) that the instructions say may take a little longer. I didn't time it but it was more like 30 seconds than the minute they tell you. The screen looks just like the pages in a book - you soon forget you are not looking at print on a paper page. If I get in low light I may want to make the print bigger though, to make it clearer. I have it set at ""2"" and I can go up to ""5"" in font size. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,the best thing since amazon.com & zappos.com,"as a senior citizen, (who me?) with the usual vision issues...i welcome the kindle with open arms! thank you for a portable ereader that i can carry everywhere. i love the changeable font sizes, the easy on the eyes aspect...actually i think the kindle is easier on the eyes than a regular paper book. i can't talk about the price, it was a gift...however, after using the kindle for awhile i would pay the price! i have heard that a color screen would be better...well, then i could just read on my pc screen....i love everything about the kindle. it is a winner in my book! thank you..."
3,Needs a redesign,"-Too easy to hit the buttons by mistake.-Takes too long to turn a page; about two seconds.-Should be compatible with the ebooks I have already purchased from Amazon.-Should play mp3s in order so I can listen to audio books that I have purchased on-line and on CDs.+I cancelled my paper subscription to WSJ and now receive it on Kindle. Saves trees.+I needed a book and wanted to start reading it now. It took 60 seconds rather than two days to ship.+I also have a Sony book reader, but there are only 1/10th of the books available from Sony and Amazon is adding books at a rapid rate.+Like the Wright brothers first airplane, this thing has many problems which should be addressed. Also like the Wright brothers, it is a technical breakthrough because it has the Sprint connection.Meanwhile, one has to love it.don"
3,DRM Mobi and native PDF - so close.,"I want to love this thing but can't. If it had mobi DRM and native PDF support I would pay the high price. I could then choose from a huge selection from Mobi books (owned by Amazon! why not support it?) or even download Mobi ebooks from my public library, and I could carry all my work documents and other ebooks in PDF. It all comes down to a small software upgrade - do that and I'm on board. DRM Mobi and native PDF. It is kinda ugly, but that's ok."
3,Kindle design flaws,"I received my Kindle a week ago. In theory it is a great concept but did they ever give it to an average ""Joe"" to test? It is impossible to handle the Kindle without pressing the next page feature. Additionally, turning it off requires removing it from the case, turning it upside down and holding the sides. This potentially increases the possibility of dropping the device and again fast forwarding the pages when one grips the sides to turn it over. Less importantly, the case is a disaster. The Kindle slides out so easily, that I fear using the device in busy locations such as the subway, train, or plane. I believe that Amazon will ultimately rectify these features on the next generation of the Kindle, however, this does not help those of us who currently paid $400 for a device that is best used a home or in other ""safe"" environments."
5,Kindle - original,Great product! Easy to understand and use. Portable. Screen is very easy on the eyes.
5,It will change your world,I've had my Kindle for about 6 months now. I bought a first generation used on Amazon. I got used to it in about 6 seconds. These days I never read a book that is not on my Kindle. GREAT device!!
4,Kindle Review,"I think the Kindle Wireless Reader is great! I am an avid reader. I have books everywhere. With the Kindle Wireless Reader I can download my books, save them and conserve space. I always read my books more than once. With my wireless reader I don't have to remember which box has the book I want to read in it. I've got it right here.I haven't had it that long and I'm still getting use to it, but so far I love it. I like how I can download a sample of the book and then decide if I want to buy it.I don't usually give reviews or do surveys, but this product is great to have or great to give."
4,Love the convenience!,"I love my Kindle! I travel a lot and often read several books at at time and like the fact that I can have multiple books in one compact, light piece. I can have my business books, self help books and fictional books all in one and read the book that sparks my fancy at the time"
4,I love my Kindle,"I got this for a gift, after our last family vacation where I literally took an extra (albeit very small) suitcase of about 10 books--so cumbersome. How great is it that this trip I only had my Kindle loaded with almost 20 books and it slipped neatly into my purse. It is so easy to handle, and comfortable to read. It took some getting used to time turning the page, there is like a 2 second delay when you go to turn the page, but I found that if I hit the button 2-3 sentences from the bottom it is smoothless. My only wish is that I could view my books in icon form with pictures of their covers. I love my Kindle."
4,Love my Kindle,"I very much enjoy my Kindle. No more books piled on my end tables.On the negative, I have been unable to get every book I've wanted."
1,IT WAS A $399 GAMBLE.,"One week after the warranty expired, so did the Kindle. This unit was not exposed to heat, moisture or rough handling. I turned it on one day and the entire screen was inked. I called customer service and they said they would not replace or repair it, but I could buy a refurbished one. So, I was out the $399 plus all of the books,magazines, etc. that I had purchased. It was an expensive year of reading. If they advertised this unit as prospectively a one-year-unit, they would not sell any. I would NEVER gamble again on a Kindle. I can buy a lot of books for the $ spent on a Kindle, and they won't up and vanish."
4,My Personal Library,"The Kindle - WOW - I'm so excited each and every time I get a second to sit and read, browse through the Kindle Store, Amazons Library. I can't wait to finish this book so that I can get on to the next book. It just seems so much easier to read off the Kindle than a regular book. Paperback, hardback don't compare, cannot compare with Kindle. No bookmarks to move around, no fingers to lick inorder to turn a page, and I don't lose my place should I happen to fall asleep. Plus the fact that I can review a book before I decide if I really want to read it, that is really great.Just one thing. If you could change the closing ability of the leather case. Something more in the line of the method used for closing the box the Kindle comes in. Elastic bands wear out quickly and then the cover is less apt to contain the device safely. Let me know, I have some ideas too.ThanksMT"
1,Dismayed and disappointed over lack of Kindle customer support,"Just for those considering buying a refurbished Kindle 1, I'd be wary of purchasing one since Amazon's technical support, or lack thereof is quite disappointing. I enthusiastically bought my Kindle when it was initially announced in 2007 but recently, the screen went completely dead and nothing I do on this end could revive it. When I called into Amazon to look into options for repairing the Kindle 1.0, I was essentially told there are no options. I can choose to put down another $180 for a refurbished Kindle 1.0 but that was it in terms of helping repair my Kindle since I was out of warranty. Even if I wanted to pay to repair my Kindle, I was told that option wasn't available. The customer service guy was nice but essentially told me I was SOL. I'm really disappointed and this gives me pause about thinking to buy a new one if it will fail this soon and I lose all my purchased books. Buyer beware."
3,"Good idea, but need to be improved.",. I want touch screen.. I want a electronic pen.. I want audio.. I want video.. I want multiple language dictionary.. I want it can store more books.. I want it cheaper.. I want the eBook cheaper.. I want .....
1,Are they nuts?,"Why on earth would I pay $400 for a hideous thing like that plus $10 per book when I can buy used books or go to the library for far less?Plus, I would probably break it in no time from splashing it with water, dropping it, falling asleep with it, etc.There is a reason books have been around for so long."
5,Perfect for travel,I love my Kindle. It is better in every way than the e-book readers of the past. Easy to download books etc. and wonderful selections from which to choose. I find it very easy to navigate and no problems with cover or buttons when reading. I recommend this to anyone who travels or just wants the convenience of being able to look for a new read whenever you choose.
1,Forced to buy Kindle?,I feel like being deprived of the rights to access normal books. Some books I would love to have are only in Kindle edition now. e-books can be good for information storage. But how many times have we printed hard copies to read? The Kindle device reminds me of the Vista system from Microsoft. Both of them force us to pay for a worse life. That's not what modern technology are supposed to do but only shows greed of mankind.
3,"price, price, price",I love to read and this looks great. I only wish it were affordable. apparently reading electronicaly is reserved for the rich. When the price comes way down I will probably get one.
1,Just rating its look...,"I am glad that so many beta testers have chimed in but there is a problem with this device and forgive me for judging Kindle by its cover but that is the problem here. As many electronics manufacturers - including Apple - have proven over time... its all about the interface if you want to sell a hand held device. It looks like the interface, button layout, keyboard, etc. were an after thought. Great looking screen - lousy interface and case design. Please do a total redesign of the case - remember that the iPod sold because people wanted other people to see them with the iPod because the iPod looked cool - why do you think that the iPod ads showed a white iPod and headphone wires on a black silhouette? Try imagining the Kindle on a black silhouette of a person and you get the idea."
5,Best gift I've ever bought,"I was fortunate enough to view both the Kindle and the Sony ereader in person and talk to someone who had both. I purchased the Kindle due to it's superior features. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and I have never seen a better response from someone in my life, including the time she received a much wanted kitten for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! Oprah featured it soon after on her TV show and for 1 day only you could receive $50 off with a certain code word. I wanted to return it and reorder it to save $50 (a substantial sum) and my 30 year daughter cried and stated that she could not give it up for 2 weeks. I of course, did not save $50. It is the best electronic device on the market! It superceded all expectations. Anyone debating whether or not to buy one, need not debate anymore! BUY IT!"
5,WONDERFUL!!,"Well, it was a little expensive, but I'm thrilled with my Kindle. You couldn't ask for more--I mean, there are some picky little things I could go on about, but I actually love my Kindle more than my laptop. I was really surprised that I could get reception for WhisperNet because we live in a very, very, very rural area, but I just turn it on, go to a certain corner of my house and here come my books. This made the perfect Christmas gift from my husband!!"
5,No buyer's remorse here,"The Kindle is great. It was so compelling I let my wife drive the 300 miles to Chicago while I sat reading in the passenger seat. My reading list is growing and I find myself browsing books in genres I typically don't explore. The access to the web and book reviews are great. During lunch break I can read samples of books before deciding to purchase. I'm very pleased with the durability, technology and ease of use. Strongly recommended for those on the fence unsure whether to buy. A non-regrettable, non-buyer's remorse purchase."
3,One Thing . . .,"Does it have the ability to read and upload your own .pdf, .doc, .chm files????? Is this think hacker proof where you are limited to buying and reading stuff only from amazon??"
2,MISSING FEATURES,"I don't know the answers. Here are some questions. Does the Kindle handle color? Video? Illustration? If so, what are the limitations and methods available? As far as I can see, there has been no comment on any of these matters. These are omissions of profound import.JIMBOps. You might add communications other than with Amazon."
1,Ugly and stupid,"This product look like what I used 20 years ago.and the interface is so stupid and how can it compare with iPod?Amazon should spend time to make the shopping experience and website better.Not to selling some ugly, and bad interface product."
3,Must be a best-customers gift.,"I haven't this product, and I confess I probably will buy it, if the price goes lower. I think that this product must be a gift from Amazon to us, the from Amazon's beginning customers. Could be better wait to a new less expensive version. Thanks for all those years Amazon..."
1,Isn't US$400 way too expensive?,"I don't have this product, and I'm not planning to have it. US$400 is an astronomical amount for just reading. You can do the same with a legacy palm m500 or any other cheap device. Well, actually I can do more without propietary formats and a high base of applications to choose. I know perfectly why e-books are not the default media for new books and it's because all of this expensive gadgets designed only for reading books, instead of using existing products. What if I have an smart phone and I'm traveling for a couple of weeks, should I bring my smart phone plus my bulky book reader in my hand bag or should I purchase my e-books in a format that can be read by my smart phone?"
4,Kindle Reader,Kindle was easy to use with almost no hassle during startup.Just wish more books were available to chose from. Downloading was a snap.Adjustable fonts a blessing.
1,Spend money for a toy which isn't yours,"It's quite sad to spend such amount of money to get a product which is still owned by its manufacturer. I prefer to have books without DRM in .odt or .txt , .latex or even .pdf file-format. I still use a Palm 501, but I'm its only owner :)"
1,Don't buy products that promote new DRM limitations,"Books have been around for a long time. Don't add DRM to the already-functional ""book"" model. There's no reason for me to buy such products, as long as the companies who sell me the products and the content continue to cripple them with unwanted features like DRM.The technical literature is filled with horror stories related to DRM and the perpetual control asserted by the schmucks who sell the equivalent of temporary, revocable licenses, instead of the actual right to use what you bought, in reasonable ways."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I ordered this product because it seemed like the perfect gift for my hustand who read constantly. I actually bought two. I received the Kindels but was never able to download a book. I called the help lines and was given all kinds of reasons as to why. You are not in the continental U.S. (Virgin Islands). You need to set up an account. I had one and gave them the number with my credit card and all. Still would not work. I was then told to buy a gift card and put in my account. I did that but it still did not work. Then I was told to go to some store and buy a prepaid card and charge to that. I did not even see an option for that. Understand, there were plenty of bars and had no problem downloading the partial books to see if he liked them. I have to send them both back as I cannot use them. Very disappointing and your tech people should be better trained. Zona Corbin"
4,How to make version 1.1 better,The previous review I read were pretty accurate outlining the pros and cons. The kindle is everything it claims to be including the ease of use. The negatives regarding the placement of buttons are also a fair. What I have done to overcome the negatives is;1.Placed a piece of scotch tape along the left edge which still allows use of the buttons and reduces inadvertent page turns.2.By velcroing the kinle to the case also makes the case more functional while still allowing access to the buttons in the back of the unit.3.I place the velcro in the center of the case.4.Remember you can turn the unit on and off by using the Alt and Font buttons.
3,An idea as yet to come. Think twice on cost.,"Bought as gift for heavy reader, but returned unopened after studying the cost benefit. Use too many sale books and then share those books with friends and have access to good library. Turned out that the fixed price even when a fraction of the publisher price in the long run was too high although the idea seemed neat. May still consider in the future."
2,Suggestions for Amazon,"I have read a lot of the reviews and thought I'd add my two cents.I appreciate the feature of not having it connected to a computer, it means I can buy another book when I'm away from home if I need something else to read. I'm willing to live with the fact that I'll have to buy books specifically for the Kindle. I would primarily use it when I travel as a way to not have to pack multiple books or make a decision before I leave what kind of mood I'm going to be in during my trip.However, the biggest drawback I see (and the one that will keep me from purchasing this until until it's resolved) is that a paper back book I can read on an airplane from the time I board until the time I land. A kindle has to be put away from the time the doors close until 10,000 feet, and then again when we land. If Amazon can clear this device with the FAA (even if ""Airplane mode"" must disable the wireless while airborn) then I have a real reason to purchase this device."
1,Cool but Overpriced,hat a another great Ebook device that is way overpriced. The only way people en mass will move to ebooks is when they are affordable and practically priced. There is little about this or any Ebook to justify the high price.
3,later,"When the case goes to non-gloss, dark gray and the price drops a couple of hundred dollars I will consider buying one of these."
1,What a Disaster - Amazon will lose a bunch of $ on this!,This is a poor attempt at a reader.- Very expensive- limited titles- waste of money- buy sony if you want qualityI am very disappointed with Amazon on this disaster of a product. You would be better served donating $399 to a charity than buying this piece of garbage.
5,Great device,"I debated and researched quite a bit before asking for this for my birthday, but I'm very happy I did. I've added quite a variety of purchased and free books to keep me occupied while waiting in different places, and for travel. I have not found the 'blacking out' while page turning distracting, and I'm very happy with the product."
4,Very useful and convenient.,"I have had my Kindle for a little over a month now, and I have to say that I love it. This device is very convenient. No more driving to book stores all over town or waiting for books to be delivered in the mail. It's 10pm on a Sunday night and I feel like reading...No problem. I fire up the Kindle and download a book instantly. Pretty nice. My only complaint would be, as others have stated, it is too easy to accidently turn the page as the right Next Page button is simply too long. Otherwise, I am very happy with the product."
5,A traveller's gift,"As someone who travels a great deal and always carries several books, the Kindle is a special gift. No longer do I have to carry heavy books, but can carry many different ones on my Kindle. I now tend to read several at a time. And I love the feature of downloading samples from books to learn whether I want to read further and then downloading entire books within minutes. And when I accidentally dropped it and its screen no longer functioned, it was immediately replaced without charge by Amazon with the most helpful service imaginable. I couldn't ask for more. The Kindle is no longer a luxury for me, it is a necessity."
5,Love it!,"I've had my Kindle for about a week and a half and I love it. It ranks withmy TIVO now for ""things I can't live without"" Microwave and Dishwashercome in second. The page buttons haven't bothered me at all. I did splurgeto buy a leather cover (in red) The Kindle is expensive so I decided to have somethingsomething elegant to carry it around in. Great selection of kindilized books. II bought the Education Of Henry Adams for 99cents."
4,Kindle,"I've had my Kindle for bout two months now and overall I love it. Buying and downloading books is very easy and the selection available is very good. I must add, however, that I'm on my second Kindle device. The first one ""died"" at a very inopportune moment--I had it loaded with books to read on my way to a 3 week trip to Europe. I switched it on at the airport and the screen froze. Consequently, I had nothing to read during the trip (I had to break down and buy an overpriced paper book at an airport bookstore).That said, when I returned from my trip Amazon promptly replaced my Kindle--very quickly with no questions asked, and all has been well ever since.It's a great device and I'd recommend it highly."
5,Great for Travelers,I absolutely love my kindle. I received my as a birthday gift a little over a year ago and have read a ton of books on it. It is great to take with you while traveling as you can download as many books as you want and not have to carry extra weight in your luggage. Just make sure to bring your charger with you. The only draw back is you cannot share your books with friends or family.The best part is you get the book you want instantly! No waiting or driving to your local bookstore to find out they don't have the book in stock. This would make a great Fathers Day Gift as well as Mothers Day Gift!!
5,Even cooler than I thought it would be!,"Have you ever been sitting in bed, and finished the book you were reading, but then realized you were out of reading material even though you weren't ready to go to sleep yet? It used to happen to me all of the time. NO MORE! I just wirelessly connect to amazon and buy another book. It takes 2 seconds. Also, all of my books are on it- so if I go on vacation I don't have to think about which books I want to take. I was worried when I bought it that reading on a screen might give me eyestrain, but I have had this about seven months, and no problems. The screen is really different than a normal computer screen. It actually looks like a page in a book- it is weird, but it really does. I am such a fan!"
4,Love this thing!,"Love this machine! I only wish there were more titles (Catch 22, Rice Mother) and that the buttons weren't located in a spot where they are easily depressed in error. In conclusion: BUY ONE!!!"
3,kindle user for 4 months,"I purchased this item in October, 2008 the problems that I have had with the Kindle the page turning bar on the side is not very practical too easy to touch and turn page while reading. Battery life does not last when you are connected to whispernet. To keep battery up you need to shut whispernet off. This will give you more reading time. I am disappointed that the newer version came out 4 months later for the same price with some feature changes that I have mentioned in my review. Better battery on the new version so they say. I like the kindle because I travel and like to read on the plane or in the car and its conveint,not bulky and you can get a new book when you want as long as you can get a signal. I hope that amazon will stock batteries for the older model. My fear is when new models come out old products disappear this is a very costly item for that to happen to."
4,Kindle is worth great,"I am enjoying the ease of use of my new Kindle. The books couldn't be easier to download from Amazon and all the products I've wanted have been available. I love not having to turn pages and keep my husband awake when reading in bed. Also like the feature to change the text size. If there is one thing I don't like is that the next page buttons are easy to bump and accidently turn a page. I have also noticed the screen having ghost images of text( I have had the kindle for a month) it does not affect my reading but I wonder if the images will burn into the screen more as time goes on. But in all, I love the Kindle !"
4,Love my Kindle!,"The Kindle is very easy to use. I love being able to download reading material all the time, and no matter where I am. The only drawback is that not every book that I want is available."
2,Kindle Keyboard,"Extremely disappointed with the Amazon Kindle. I bought it because I was under the impression that it would be useful and efficient for my university work. However, half of the time the files do not send to the kindle and when they do they are not fully there. It is also slow and unresposive. I would not recommend paying anywhere near 150 for this product. Thoroughly disappointed and irritated."
1,not AGAIN!?!,"The kindle is one of my favorite gadgets to use. I love how easy and convenient it is to download books and have them instantly available on the kindle and kindle library. It is a great concept except for the fact that the first kindle I purchased lasted for two glorious weeks then froze, rendering it completely useless. After I received my replacement kindle I downloaded some school textbooks and a couple novels. In the middle of the novel, (one that is impossible to put down), my brand new kindle FROZE. Again. I was devastated that one of the best books I have ever read was ripped from my grasp yet again, not to mention my extremely expensive textbooks were not available to me during class. I wish I had a device that was worth the $139.00 I spent on it!!! If I can't use the device due to technical difficulty, I guess it doesn't really matter how ingenious a concept it is..... Wish I spent the money on some old fashion paper books instead."
5,"So easy,even for me ....",Easy to download the books I enjoy with no trouble at all.I get so much enjoyment from it !!!
4,1st Generation,At the time - it was fantastic! I loved being able to look up word definitions quickly while reading and ordering new books immediately when I first saw them on TV etc.
1,Poor quality and worse customer service,"I got my 3G kindle for mother's day in 2011 - it was great- I love reading on it, the ease of use, etc was wonderful. It crapped out in January 2012 - 9 months later- lines and bars on the screen etc, The customer service then was great- replaced it right away- no problem. I have had this second device 363 days and it just crapped out too - same problem, lines and bars on the screen. I was told it is no longer under warranty and that I just have 'bad luck"". I could replace it with a discounted refurbished kindle for $79- why would I? My track record is that this device is not good for very long......The 2 service reps just apologized nicely and couldn't offer anything better or any assurances that a new device would be better. This is terrible customer service> BTW we have a Mac, Mac laptop, IPad, etc- devoted Apple people= but not for the kindle. They really need to improve the manufacture of these devices.Roberta"
1,Expensive Three Year Investment,"This consumer owns a first generation Kindle just out of warranty period. The product's screen is wearing out. The cursor moves upon and down the left margin and defines the initial word on every line then jumps about the page when a menu selection is attempted. Higlights appear suddenly and screen lighting fades in and out. After numerous attempts to correct the problem with customer service support, I've been informed that there is NO FIX.That being said, I asked for compensation toward a new product and was told by Jim, 694813, that I would be compensated $20 toward a reconditioned Kindle Touch or 3G Wi-Fi. Initial investment of $320. I have had the product for three years and bought $700 in books.I would not purchase any Kindle product or any e-book from Amazon. I am no longer an Amazon customer.This situation reeks of corporate greed."
2,Kindle Paperwhite,"I recieved a Kindle as a gift in December 2011. As of January of 2012 I have 120 archived items. I loved it! Christmas 2012 I recieved a Kindle Paperwhite and have read 2 books since and there is no comparison to my original. The only good thing is the light. I don't like the fact that you can't see the page you are on, changing pages is awkward and takes several tries every time, but if you even tough the screen my mistake it changes. The fancy bookcovers instead of the list of items is not an improvement and the other book covers that are I suppose to make me buy other books are not welcome. I am very very disappointed with this new device and will most likely go back to my old one. I would not recommend the Paperwhite to anyone and I was a big fan of my original."
1,Very disappointed,"Terrible product, I cannot believe there is a line for this... I think they just say sold out to make it more popular. I ordered this product and about a month later I got it. I was so excited to try it out.. and it worked great for about 3 hours... then it got stuck, it wont navigate away from the page that I was on. I tried to reset, take the battery out.. everything. Even the guys on the phone werent able to figure out the issue.I think the eINK technology has not integrated well with the amazon product. The customer service guys said this was a common problem and they would send me a new one. That turns off my interest in eBooks for the time being.This is a great product if it works...unfortunately for me, it was a terrible experience."
3,"No High School required reading available, no backlight","I got a Kindle for each of my daughters who have low vision and could use the large print capability to read their school books. Alas, none of their required high school or college Freshman level reading assignments are available for Kindle. Couldn't even get them ""The Tale of Beedle the Bard"" just for fun reading. Wasted a lot of money. Also, without a back light it is so limited. If we could get books to read on it, it might work out for them just fine. There just isn't a selection yet."
2,Hard to hold,It is neat but was hard for me to hold since barely touching either side turns the page. Even with the cover on. I had to return. Too expensive and page turner in the way.
1,Kindle Not Acceptable To Business People,"I would really like to buy a Kindle as I often travel and I'm tired of lugging around books and a computer to read my business pdf documents. A Kindle would reduce that to one light-weight reader. BUT the Kindle won't read pdf files without having to send them in via email to be converted. Businesses don't like this because it violates confidentiality - what kind of business would want their unencrypted business plans and financial reports going through email to be encrypted and then back as equally unencrypted pdf documents? I'm a management consultant dealing with corporate compliance and all of my clients have strict policies about confidentiality with many of them having encryption software required on portable computers. Amazon is really missing the mark on this and since the Kindle is based on LINUX, it should be fixable. After all, it would increase sales and I'm sure Amazon would like that."
2,"Too expensive, not enough titles","This is a good idea, but the price is way too high and the selection of book titles is too limited. I seldom buy best sellers. If the price were lower and all of Amazon's book inventory were available on this device, I would consider it."
2,Price over Performance,"If sold at $100, I could definitely be interested in this product. But when you sell it at $400, then people are going to compare it with iPhone technology. At $400 I would expect the following:A sleeker, easier to use design (it looks 5 yrs old)Touch screen (keypad takes up 30% of device)Color (why eliminate more books)Multi document support (at least PDF / Word)Books on tape capability10 book creditI could go on but you get the idea. It's a cool concept, especially when traveling and I like the wireless network at no fee. Hopefully down the road they (or Apple) will get it right."
4,best e-book reading I've experienced,"I got my Kindle during the $50 off promotion from Oprah in October 2008. I have to say that despite the expense, I recommend this to anyone who loves to read and is ""mobile"" or travelling a lot. I am reading a lot more now that I just have to carry this little paperback-sized device in my bag. Sure, it's got some minor flaws that can be improved upon, but since there isn't any planned redesign on the horizon, I took the plunge and am GLAD I did!"
5,Kindle rating,"I love my kindle. I love the idea of the books ""on demand"". It is convenient and just the right size."
5,LOVE the concept device is so so,Have used my Kindle for a few days now. Love the concept and the service. Shame the SD reader is not SDHC as it would be nice to use it with some of my larger cards. I'm not so sure it was USB 2.0 the transfer was a little slow but I did walk away from it when moving files to my Kindle. I cant stand the Page next and Prev page buttons. I seem to always be hitting them. Would be nice to be able to lock one side or the other. The amount of plastic sucks. For the price it should have been a nice metal. And ugh! No power on the USB port. So forget a usb light.
5,When I was a child I allways had a book in my hands but......,"I am originally from Cuba. When I was a child I allways had a book in my hands. Came to this country, new language,need to read technical books, etc, I forgot was easy reading was.The Kindle has brought it back to me.Please Amazon, keep increasing the choicesI know it can be improve, what does't?But it does a wonderfull job"
5,New Kindle User,"I can't say i know all there is to know about the Kindle or that i have taken advantage of all its uses. I can say, that right out of the box i was able to use it - was very intuitive. In the less than 48 hours i have had it, i think it is the ""cat's meow""!"
2,Search Flaw,"When I received my Kindle the very first thing I did was go to the Kindle Books section to see which books I would like to download. After selecting a topic (Mystery) my first search criteria was author. I wanted to see the available list of books by author. Well, I couldn't. I called customer service and explained my problem hoping the representative could tell me how to go about looking up selections by author. But alas I was told that was not an option within the browse function. I find it hard to believe that I'm the first person who tried to browse by author. After all, every bookstore I've ever browsed through, after being sectioned by topic, is then alphabetized by author. I think browsing by author would be a lot more useful than browsing by price. Whether the price is highest to lowest, or lowest to highest. I hope in the near future the selection of author will be added to the browse function."
3,Content just too expensive,"I kept the Kindle for about 2 weeks. In that time I downloaded some sample chapters, one book, and subscribed to a newspaper. I just couldn't see that the expense of the books and papers were worth it. I enjoyed the book I purchased quite a lot, and then realized that I could not loan it to anyone, because no one I know has a Kindle. I downloaded tons of free books from the Project Gutenberg site, but I could have done that to another e-reader, a cheaper one without the wireless download capability. The reason I chose the Kindle was because the wireless feature sounded so convenient -- and it was -- but I couldn't see that the expense was worth it.I read a lot, but mostly books from the library. I don't buy books all that often.One day I will own an ereader of some kind. It will have to be compatable with ebooks from the library.I returned the Kindle."
2,Kindle Review,"This is the coolest peice of technology - when it works. I have had my device a month and it freezes periodically for days.....its very unreliable and very frustrating. I would wait until the next generation comes out, its got to get better."
3,1st Generation Has Some Issues,"Since this is the first generation there are issues with this product. No backlight so you can't read it in any place that is not well lit. No color. If you are going to download magazines there are no color pictures (i.e. Time) not sure that it is worth downloading magazines until they can make it more like the magazine. Newspapers are very good. USA Today needs to step up and get going to get on this device.And one more thing, the registration process you go through if you have bought this as a gift is not very user friendly. The process is difficult and cumbersome and Amazon needs to make it easier. One click the registration instead of trying to think ahead and register the device to the Amazon account that bought it as a gift. You should have asked that question when I was buying it so we wouldn't have had to go through a Deregister process."
4,????,"i don't get why people are nagging on Kindle. It's just like the reading PADDs from Star Trek minus the cool colors. It is a convienient tool. My back pack will no longer be laden down with books on trips. It might contain a crossword book once in a while, but other than that Kindle all the way. It does not mean I am going to stop browsing through book stores though. Nor will it keep me from opening one up in Florida."
5,Kindle love,"I have had my Kindle since December. I really have enjoyed it tremendously! It really is the future of the printed word. Some bugs have yet to be worked out. The case does not protect the device securely, and many of the books I would like to read are not as yet available. I am patient, I am sure they will become available eventually.I would highly recommend the Kindle for the avid reader. It is small and convenient, with no hassle about finding storage space for the finished books."
3,Kindle Wireless Reading Device,"This product is amazing. It delivers what it promises - wirelessly downloading your purchase in under a minute. It was easy to read. My disappointment was in the design. The 'next page' features are on the edges and you are constantly changing pages when you don't mean to. Color would be a big plus - especially if you plan to download magazines and other material with pictures. I returned my product and decided to wait for some improvements in the design and reduction in price. I also have a concern that like everything else, prices of reading material will go up. Unlike owning a book, you can't share it, donate it or display it, and once you've read it, you've read it. I would hate to invest this much in a reading device and have the ebooks become priced above what makes sense to purchase them.Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device"
4,Kindle -- both good and poor,"Using the Kindle is fantastic, you can really get into a book. We have had no technical glitches at all -- everything we have tried has worked. The wireless receipt of a book is a great feature and has been flawless. We especially like the font size button and easily read screen.I think the next page and previous page activators need to be revised. It is way too easy to hit one or the other when holding the Kindle. The on=off switch needs to put on the front of the device, so that you are not always putting it in the holder or taking it out. And when you do, you always hit next page or previous page.I think the fees for the books are also pricey.But all in all, I am glad we got it and will keep using it."
4,"Great, but.....","I love the Kindle, but like lots of folks it comes up short in two areas:folders (that sure would be nice) and repositioned/resized page turn buttons. Other than that, I'd give it 5 stars."
3,No Sprint Coverage,I have to wonder why they chose sprint's network? I live in Rural Oregon and Sprint is just about the ONLY cell phone service that will not reach here.
2,Warrenty problems,Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading DeviceThe battery failed it seems. The warrenty is is not easy to use. They send you to companies they deem responsible. Spent lots of money for such a poor service.
4,"Great new toy, but it's more than that....","Just getting used to it, it takes just a few minutes to get comfortable with the main controls. I'm amazed at how fast you can get a complete book downloaded. Price is fair, and the book prices I've found have been more than fair. The NowNow service is also amazing, and has already come in handy. This one is a keeper."
5,I can take my library everywhere!,I'm enjoying reading from the Kindle... I often read more than one book at a time... I live in the country... whenever we go into town my husband drives and I read. I can choose any of my books to read at any time because I have them all with me.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I wanted to order the Kindle last year when it first came out, but my children convinced me that I would rather hold and read the actual book, so I took my name off of the list. They were wrong. I have had my Kindle for 3 weeks, and just love it. It feels great in my hand, and is very easy to set up and learn. On a recent plane trip 2 flight attendants and several passengers checked it out. I think they are going to ask for one for the holidays!!Thank you Jeff for your wonderful invention! Suzanne Rubinson"
5,Efficient Kindle Review,"I am an avid reader. I never thought I would switch from paper to an electronic reader. After a few days with the Kindle, I never want to go back to paper. I read on my way to work on a commuter train. I didn't have a problem with glare or flickering text. Thank goodness, the screen isn't like a laptop monitor! And I can store multiple books.....I am truly in book Heaven!I have a couple of bones to pick with the Kindle Designers though. The holder isn't so great. The Kindle almost fell out a couple of times. I would buy a different case if it were available. Also, the Kindle is a very ugly battleship grey color. On the plus side, no one would want to steal it. Yes, people it is that ugly.Kindle is wonderful but you are not getting cute."
4,great idea,"I've had my Kindle for a few months now and have very few complaints. The main one is that I like to share a really enjoyable reading experience with a close friend or relative -- and I can't pass my Kindle around! The other is that now that I'm accustomed to it, Amazon has come out with a new model and no discount for us old-timers. There should be a trade-up allowance or some other incentive. I take mine everywhere and it is such a convenience to pull out at the Dr's office or DMV while I wait!"
5,Easy to use,"The Kindle is really easy to use. What I love most is that I don't have to lug loads of books around on a trip anymore, it's cheaper to buy the books and I'm helping the environment by not printing and shipping."
5,kindle,"One of the coolest toys I ever bought. Access the internet---though limited, but still good---from anywhere for free. read new and classic books you purchase at reasonable prices from Amazon---more than 220,000 titles, download to computer and transfer hunreds of thousands more public domain classics---really cool."
3,kindle,The Kindle is terrific except it is not back lit so that you can read in a dark room. I know I can buy a light however it is not convenient.It is really easy to order a book with out your computer
2,Too expensive,"I can't afford to drop a $400 dollar book. If I drop a paper book it doesn't break. If I (worse case) drop it in a puddle I can dry it out.If it were $100 dollars I would buy 4 (one for each of the readers in my house).Books are about content. A reading device needs to follow that logic. To become universal, any reader needs to deliver content without detracting from the experience -- $400 detracts from the experience and is out of reach. Also, $400 and buys an awful lot of regular books."
2,Can get an ultra-portable laptop for this price,"ASUS Eee PC 4G Notebook PC (7"", 512 MB RAM), Pearl WhiteSame price and so much better: flash hard drive, color screen, stereo speakers, built-in WiFi, etc.Amazon should give the Kindle away with a requirement that consumers buy 2 or 3 e-books per month. Whomever set this price point for Kindle isn't too bright; how are you supposed to afford books after dropping $400 on this?"
1,Aweful!!!,"So, I've now owned the Kindle reader for about 6 hours & have nothing but problems with it!! Customer service is a JOKE! No one is even there I swear! The product's Wi-Fi is aweful! It can't pick up service where my laptop & cell phone are strong signals!! And yes, the wi-fi connectivity is ON. I can't register the product on-line or thru the device, so pretty much it's a $400 worthless paper-weight!! I HATE this thing!! And was way excited to get it too!!"
2,Lacks PDF support,"This looks like a good product, but the way that I'd use it, it's not complete yet.If it had color capability, that would be good, but that's not critical. See below.The thing I'd use it for is to store and organize the hundreds of scientific papers that I work with (I'm a physicist.) They are all available as .pdf files, and not jpgs, gifs, or word documents. If this device could store and manage .pdf files, I'd get one in a heartbeat, even for $100 more. But the headaches of reformatting papers is a killer - I'm still worried about having to e-mail them to the device. If it could tap into the internet (like it does for wikipedia,) and get .pdfs, it would be a killer device, and almost every working scientist would have one within 2 years.Regards,Martin"
5,"Best ""Book"" ever invented.","I feel very Green with this product. With the amount of books I read, I feel that I have cut down on the number of trees elimated. Best of all, the Kindle is so easy to get used to using. When I mistakenly dropped my first Kindle in the sink, it was hard to wait for the replacement."
5,You've Got to get it!!,"I absolutely LOVE the Kindle!!!! It is so user friendly and the ability to get new reading material in less than a minute is awesome! I have been showing everyone my Kindle and they all want one. Don't hesitate, order this and I know you'll love it!"
5,Kindle a great product,"I love my new Kindle. I am going on vacation soon, can't wait to use it on the plane and at the resort. Money well spent"
4,Better than sliced bread....,"This is better than sliced bread or the invention of the automobile. This is the best thing I've owned in ages! I'm an avid reader, out of shelf space, and too anxious to wait for the library to make new books available quickly. It's easy to use, eco friendly (think of all the trees that will be saved), easy to read and handles like a book; I take it with me where ever I go. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because some books I'm interested in reading are not available, perhaps because some authors are not making their books available as an e-book. I think it is only a matter of time and they all will. Any book lover will treasure this."
5,YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY THIS!,"I am an avid reader and let me tell you, this product has changed my life! I have two children that I have to take places (we're talking doctor appts, sporting events, stores...you name it.) A lot of time is spent waiting to be seen for something. Now, I just take my slim, space saving, light weight Kindle from my purse and read while I'm waiting. It's so convenient! Everyone should get one! I love it!! I will be buying these as Christmas gifts this year. Everyone can use one. The beauity of it is you don't have to have computer knowledge in order to operate it. Best buy ever, you won't regret it! Say goodbye to heavy costly books - the Kindle is here to stay!"
4,Delicate Kindle,"Great for reading and carrying your books. The reason I took the 1 star off is that you can't handle the book while it's on. If you do, you'll be spending hours looking for the page you were on because the page turner is on the edge, and you can't avoid it. Especially when you have arthritis in your hands."
4,kindle review,Great gadget. Have bought many books without leaving my chair. Love the long battery charge. The ONLY thing I wish it had were a light so that I could read without a light on.
2,Screen Still Not Right,The e-ink display on the Kindle flashes black when you are changing pages and takes about a second to 'turn' the page. This forces you out of the imaginary realm of what you are reading into the real world.When you actually sit down and try to read on the Kindle (or Sony eBook) - you are constantly shoved out of your imagination by the lag and the full-screen black flash.Many have commented on the limitations of formatting and content. I have a simpler complaint - I can't get lost in a book in this format. The Black Flash kills the continuity.
1,Library use!!,"I just purchased a Kindle for my 72 year old wife that uses the library often only to find one can not download library books......she will be VERY disapointed!! Suspect I will need to return the ""book"" without even trying it!!"
2,Format of the Text is Deplorable,"I recieved my Kindle as a gift. The formatting I have seen in their version of the book I'm reading and a few samples is deplorable (spelling, grammar, no paragraph indicators, etc.). It's like reading Facebook -- only it's not Facebook: it's literature. Shame on Amazon."
2,Kindle's days are over,"I've owned my Kindle for two years and stopped using it six months ago.- Book Pricing: The prices are going up on the kindle books and periodicals. WSJ price when up 50% last spring.- Kindle Pricing: Watch more devices approach the price of the kindle and offer many more features - tablets that let you watch movies and browse the web in color.- DRM: Paperback books and Kindle books are effectively the same price but with digital rights management, my kindle book is forever tied to me. I can't share it with a friend or family member or trade it at a used bookstore."
4,"Just need more titles! What's your problem, publishers??","I like the Kindle very much. I couldn't disagree more with anyone who has any problems holding the device or using the buttons - it couldn't be more ergonomic or easy to use.My only complaint at all is that most of the books I want to read aren't available on the Kindle. I'm not sure why publishers wouldn't all want to do it -- I would pay full price if I could just get the books. Just a sample - I want to download 2666, Replay and The Name of the Wind, and all are unavailable via Kindle. I can only hope this is a fairly early adopter's issue and that it will be better in the future because so far I've been frustrated with that. But the device itself seems great. I love that you can read in the sun unlike a lot of laptop screens. I also love the environmentally-friendly aspect since I belong to 2 book clubs and I'm sick of the books piling up."
3,How Far to Go & Flipping pages,"I like to know how far I have to go to the end of a chapter -- for a good stopping point -- but, I've not discovered any way to tell this other than advancing page after page to check it out, and then flipping back page by page to resume reading. I have a problem with accidentally touching the ""next page"" and ""previous page"" bars -- this happens far too frequently which makes me question the overall design."
3,Kindle,"The Kindle is alright to read from but the buttons on the left side are not comfortable for going to the next page. I have a terrible time typing on those itsy bitsy keys but I suppose younger people who are used to texting wouldn't have a problem. I like being able to read the first chapter before buying a book. I also like the instant delivery. I know if I get snowed in this winter, I will be able to acquire books."
4,Enjoying my Kindle,"I received my new Kindle a few weeks ago and am enjoying this new reading experience. I love the sample aspect and it does provide instant gratification for my reading selections. I live a long way from a bookstore so the sample aspect it very helpful.Now the criticisms. I don't really like the cover. It just doesn't seem to work right. Perhaps a slip cover would be better for transport and protection. The Kindle is rather hard to hold and probably needs a more ergonomic design. I like the rubber part on the back. The operation itself seems smooth and I haven't had any problems. Overall, I really like this new play toy."
4,Love the Kindle!,"I just got the Kindle for my birthday, and I love it. It's easy to read on, easily transportable, easy to use, and generally awesome. I also love the preview function to determine when you can buy a book. I have a few minor complaints (hence the 4-star instead of 5-star review), but the good parts far outweigh the bad onesComplaintsNot enough books on KindleSome of the books that are on Kindle are not well adapted to the technology (the table of contents aren't active on some of them)it's too easy to accidentally hit next pageit's too easy to buy books on Kindle (just one click...I'm getting addicted!)You can't opt to pay for your Kindle books on your Kindle with a gift certificate (you can on Amazon.com, but not when buying directly from the device)If you are a voracious reader, like I am (3-4 books a month, at least), the device will pay for itself in no time. It's wonderful, especially because I live in a studio apartment and have no more room for books."
4,Easy to use and goes anywhere.,"Really enjoy the Kindle and have bought 3 books in a short time.Only complaint (problem) is that the off~on and internet switches are extremly small and hard to work. (I am 70). Also they are on the back and you have to take the Kindle out of it's case to turn it off and or on.Other than that, I like it and would recommend it to anyone that likes to read."
4,Fabulous!,I love my Kindle. I have already read 3 books and have bought half a dozen more. The samples are great to decide if you want to buy. I usually carry at least 4 or 5 books on a trip and the space saver is great.It is much easier to read since page turning is so simple. That is also the only thing that keeps this review from having 5 stars. The page turn buttons are so large that it is easy to hit them and skip to the next page before you are ready. The Kindle doesn't seem to want to sit securely in the case. I think it needs some velcro or a hook of some type if you are going to read it while in it's cover.Keep adding more books and magazines!Mehri
1,VERY disappointed,Kindle locked up. I hit the reset button on the back and it would work for about 5 minutes then lock up again. after several times it would not come back on again. Also I would lose my place in the book. Even removing the battery would not unlock it. I have returned it for credit.
1,failure,"This product is even worse than Sony eReader, which was pretty bad to begin with.1. No PDF support2. Need to pay Sprint for file transfer,3. no Wi-Fi,4. Screen is too small,5. no back light option,6. unnecessary buttons,7. ugly8. $400 ???You gotta be kidding me!"
3,Must support PDF and have a larger screen to be useful,"I have borrowed the device from a friend of mine and spent a day with it. First of all, it's a lot smaller in person than it looks on the photo, which means the screen is really tiny as well. This is par for the course for the current generation of readers, but really, I will need a larger screen before I consider buying it, particularly if it's almost four hundred bucks. Second, one of the reasons for me to get one would be to read scientific papers on it. So I was disappointed to find out that it doesn't properly render the equations. Again, when a full blown laptop is cracking the $400 mark, I expect something like Kindle to properly support PDF at least. So I'm waiting for Kindle 2.0 with 12"" 300dpi screen and full PDF support. Don't disappoint me, Amazon!"
3,"I would love to try this product, please make it $100!","All of the advertisements and author recommendations make this product very appealing to me. I am a tech-geek and avid reader so it would seem to be somewhat targeted toward my demographic.The price tag is what is preventing me from purchasing and therefore trying this product. This strikes me as a risky purchase, particularly when you consider you'll also have to pay for books which further drives up the total cost.Since I don't have the benefit of seeing this device first hand, I'll never know how much I really want it!The right price-point for me to try this product solely on the positive author recommendations and clever advertising would be around $100.I really hope the price comes down and this product is successful enough that future improvements and iterations of the product line will be made - a device like this is missing from my life."
1,Beware the coverage area,"This was a gift to me - I gave it back to the giver for them to return it because, you guessed it, the wireless service used by this device doesn't cover the area where I live.So regardless of features, available books, privacy issues, coolness - look at the map before you order this. Look at the map closely. Remember that this particular wireless service is well known for lack of coverage away from cities and Interstate highways. Yes, I could drive about twenty miles and sit by the exit from the nearest Interstate and read. But I won't do that."
4,Kindle,"I just finished my first full book on Kindle, ""World without end"" by Ken Follet. I was pleased in all ways. It is a different experience than reading a large hard back book but its really like the difference between reading a large hardback and a paperback. If you have a choice you''ll read a hardback but you can't take a 1200 page book everywhere. Its a fantastic device to take several books with you when you travel and the function to change font sizes is a welcome feature if you like to read at the end of the day when the eyes get tired. Its different and its not the same experience as a traditional book but its strengths out weight any of its short comings."
2,You know how many books I could buy for that?,"Great concept, way too expensive. I'm a geek and a bookworm, so this appeals to me greatly, but who can afford that kind of price for a single use gadget? Good start Amazon, now bring it down to reality."
3,i dont own one but i know what it needs,"What about back lighting for reading in the dark. It seems like a pretty easy thing to do. If not actually back lit, (hard on the eyes), maybe low light built in the frame around the screen. I'll wait for the next Generation when it's all touch screen and has worked out the kinks. But if you have the cash I don't think you can go wrong."
2,Check out the wireless service before you buy....,"I was suckered into buying 2 kindles after watching Oprah rave about them. Come to find out after receiving mine, there is no Sprint wireless in my area! Major bummer. Can't get newspaper or magazine automatic downloads. I must go to Amazon to purchase a book, download it to my computer, then download it to my kindle. About a 5 step process, not so easy. Need to get another wireless service as Sprint is not found in about 50% of the USA. Come on Jeff Bezos at Amazon and Sprint! Get another wireless company or expand your service area.Also, price is way too much! I wouldn't pay this much again.I will keep it and give it some time, but definitely not my favorite thing...."
3,Carlson Reaction,"A convenient way to buy and store books. Especially like font size flexibility. I'm not clear on how I will ""remove"" books read. Understand you store copies of my purchases on your servers. Right now I'd like to remove sample pages I downloaded. How do I do that? Think you need a better book management system for users. If there is one it should be more transparent."
1,Coverage everywhere?,Might be interesting if they bother to provide coverage in my rural area of northern Virginia. I give it no stars.
5,May be the best purchase I've made,I am an avid reader and have a whole library of books. In fact I don't have much room for any more. I was at a Salon and a woman next to me was reading her Kindle. I thought it was amazing. As soon as I got home I signed into Amazon and read all about. It took me about two weeks to decide if I should really spend that much money on an e-book. I had never heard of an e-book before. I love it! I got carried away at first and kept ordering books. Now I have paced myself. Also there are a lot tips in the community forums and such where you can learn how to get the most out of your Kindle. I was a little disappointed in the cover. Mine never seems to stay on right. I see now that an a/c cord is included. When I bought mine that was not the case. That is great that this is now included. I highly recommend the Kindle to anyone who reads a lot.
5,Kindle Rocks,"I've had my kindle for a little over a month and I have to say that it is exactly what I wanted out of an ebook. The device works just as advertised I can read it in any lighting condition and forget that I'm reading on a device and not a book. The selection through amazon is wonderful considering this is a first gen device. The dictionary feature is particularly nice, instead of deducing what a definition might be I can look it up in under 30 sec and know exactly what it means. I haven't really come across any major drawbacks, as long as you remember that this is an ebook reader and not a palm pilot iphone or gameboy. All in all this device is great for any avid reader and will help save space from all the books in your house that are now on one device that's about the size of a paerback book."
5,Kindle is great!!!,"So far it's a wonderful device, easy to operate (Unfortunately for Amazon Customer Service, dense ""Operator Error"" on this end --) Got one for my Brother-in-law [has more time for reading than I do] for the upcoming Holiday, so he will let you know what he thinks too!!! I'm very pleased, but just wish I had more time to delve into it."
5,Christmas Present to Me,I bought the Kindle for myself for Christmas. Of course I had to open it as soon as it was delivered. The Kindle is ready to go when you get it.The download time is just what they say under a minute. It's just like reading a book. I had to change the font size but that was easy also. This is the best money I have spent and worth every dime. The Kindle is everything it is said to be.
4,GEE Kindle Review,"Overall love Kindle. Page turning buttons a little too sensitive. One has to be very careful about where you place your hands. Would recommend on/off and wireless buttons be moved to front and the place to plug in earphones be moved to side since one tends to hold the Kindle in vertical position by resting it on your lap, pillow or something. Think you could find a better term for the music prompt than Expiermental. Thanks for opportunity to comment.GEE"
4,Bought it for my wife,"She loves it and that she doesn't have to carry multiple books. More and more titles added daily. Hope the price comes down, it is way overpriced for the technology."
5,Kindle--Works Great--Good Support,"Amazing Product--My only complaint was the difficulty in canceling a ""trial"" subscriptionHowever, got great support--"
2,What about audio?,"I do not own the Kindle and will not buy it because it is not an audio-book as well. I will wait till they combine an audio-book and an e-book; this way I can read at home, or listen in the car. I also think that school books would be best served as a combo; if students both read and listened at the same time, it should help them."
1,wait for 2.0,"Design isn't perfect, especially for the price. Very cool product, but its bugs are irritating. Believe me, if you plan to read 10 pages a day---which isn't much---within a week you'll wish you'd waited for VERSION 2.0. Funky buttons. Weird, sporadic back flashing. The buttons aren't right. Wait. Wait. WAIT. Amazon got a solid double on this one, but won't get a run scored until the next batter."
2,"good idea, not yet there...","Another failed try! Let's see, if we want to replace paper books and save the Amazon rainforest; the technology is here: e-ink. The Sony e-reader and the Iliad by irex.com were the first. But, wow! amazon.com didn't review the previous and just made another try! Price is VERY expensive, first drawback. But the worst is this: no open to external formats!Dear Jeff; you must find a way to sell your e-books safetly trough the web site and let the Kindle read any other files from a PC. I guess the point is to control that the e-books aren't craked and fall in file swapping sites like emule like mp3 music.But have in mind soon you'll see a Chinese made e-reader open to all formats by 99,99.The point is to create crack proof e-books (hard task).Is a matter of software.Then the e-ink revolution will kill paper books."
2,They let the engineers do the aesthetics...,"That much is obvious. Apple brings in artists to do their product designs, it's why they always end up in MoMa's industrial design gallery. This...looks like the pure-mathematics engineers designed it. I'm sorry, but it's terribly ugly and unappealing, it looks like part of a fax machine made in the 1990's. It does not entice you to pick it up like an iPod Touch does.As to functionality, $400 is WAY over the mark for a device that nickel-and-dimes the consumer for all of its content. For that business model, they should have gone with the inkjet printer paradigm...the printer's $79, but they keep selling you ink.And as to the e-ink and all...can you tell me exactly what this device can do that a ten-year-old Palm or nearly twenty year old Apple Newton can't do? Text files in nice fonts, check. Backlight...doesn't have it? And it's proprietary.Sorry, but I think Bezos missed the mark here. Steve Jobs won't be losing any sleep."
4,Kindle Review,"Overall I love the Kindle. I have experienced 2 problems so far. 1) I frequently hit the right side page turning bar unintentionally. ie the bar i s almost the entire height of the Kindle and there is very little space to hold the Kindle without touching the page turn bar). 2) I was in a bookstore in Rhinecliff, NY and found a book I wanted to buy.(A Pet Nutrition Book). I decided not to buy it because I knew I could order it on my Kindle. The Kindle Store did not have it in their inventory. I was disappointed. Aside from that, I love the product and enjoy reading. In the next model, please provide more room for holding the Kindle while reading. Thank you, Rosemarie O'Gorman"
3,co-mingle,"I was given a Sony Reader for Christmas, which I really enjoy, but.....some books I've found in the Kindle and not in the Sony reader, it would be really nice if they could co-mingle, yes I know, and peace on earth!"
5,AMAZING!!!,"The Kindle is revolutionary and is an amazing new product! When I got my first one, it arrived broken and I immediately replaced it. I LOVE it. Being a mother of a little one, this device has allowed me to read on the go and not have to worry about the bulkiness of a book. My mother also got one and LOVES it as well. I recommend it to everyone. My two favorite features are the fact I can look words up right on the spot and the kindle store makes things very easy. GREAT job AMAZON!!!"
5,Kindle the best thing ever,I have never read so much since I got this. I bought it right before I went on a 14 day cruise. I was going to be at sea for 10 days and figured I would need to take a lot of books. Then I found this. I ordered it and got it 2 days before I left. I loaded 7 books the first night and it was so easy.The only thing was I could not load anything while I was at sea so I am glad I had gotten everything I wanted before I left. Just a note the newspaper or magazine subscriptions would not work on some trips.I purchased it at the end of October and it is now the end of November and I have read 5 books. I just can't put it down.
5,I think my Kindle is awesome!,"Before when I would be leaving to go some where my friends would make comments like ""Are you moving out?"" Mainly because I had a huge bag filled with reading material. Now I just grab a simple little device that is no bigger then a book itself. I don't have to fight with turning pages, or binders that are hard to keep open.The reading area is a good size even without changing the size of the font. Love being able to sample a few chapters of the book before deciding to buy.The only problem I had with it was keeping the Kindle from sliding out of it's cover. But I fixed it by placing a small strip of velcro on the back of the Kindle that attached to the inside back cover, which holds it in place on the cover.But it is an awesome thing to have."
5,"Mi amigo, Kindle!","I purchased my Kindle because I live in Mexico and it is soooo expensive to buy English language books here and/or have them imported. I've been wanting one for a year and finally realized that I could download to my computer and transfer to my Kindle. Kindle is definitely my ""pride & joy"" and I wouldn't part with it for any amount of money...have had several offers too. I LOVE IT!!! I am soooo happy that I have the joy now of reading whatever I want, whenever I want, without the hassle of trying to get books to Mexico. May I say 'MUCHAS GRACIAS' to the KINDLE TEAM. You are the GREATEST!"
5,Best Purchase of the year,I love my Kindle and recommend it for anyone who travels and loves to read. The ease of downloading books and convenience of carrying all those books in one neat package.
4,I LOVE IT!!!!,"I love it!!!! The only thing I would change is the ON/OFF stitch, moving it from the back to the front. When it is in the holder it is very inconvient to separate the Kindle from the holder to turn it off; especially if your concentrating on reading and suddenly your called because its now your turn. But other than that I have had no problems with the Kindle. My daughter and her boy friend saw it and now its at the top of both their Christmas lists."
5,kindle love,"what a brilliant and clever and wonderful product. i do alot of traveling and carrying books and newspapers is just a big pain. now, i have my kindle and no more heavy bags, no more desire to leave books in hotel rooms because i dont want to carry them home.there are a few technical issues that i would fix if i was designing a new kindle....it's hard to hold it without hitting a button. too many buttons in too many places.otherwise, it's a gem!!"
4,Life changing for me....,"I was originally holding out for the next generation, because I could see there were some issues and I wanted color for cookbooks, etc. But then I decided that it might be some time before the next generation is developed. After all, everyone isn't Apple. (thank god)So, my husband encouraged me to ""just order it already, you know you want to!"" and I'm so glad he did. The ease of ordering new books when I want them, and the fact that it's so easy on the eyes (mine are getting old) has completely rekindled (no pun intended) my love of reading. So even if the next generation is out in 6 months, it will have been worth it for me.Buy the aftermarket leather cover if you want one that works well. I think it's about $30. Just chuck the one it comes with."
4,Cool device,"I've had my kindle for a few months now. It's terrific for what it is meant to do. Buying books, reading, and ergonomics are all well done by Kindle. A few items for a future version would be:Color DisplayFaster page turningAccess to Kindle Store made internationalStill many gaps in published work (cannot purchase on device)A scroll device for moving through the book (not just up and down the page, but through the book) as opposed to using buttonsIt's fun to show people the product and they have many questions. It is a curiosity. Once you get used to it, it is superior to holding/transporting big heavy books.It is a bit expensive still, though you do save a little on the published book price. Hopefully the price will drop dramatically on the standard (current) device as they release a new version."
4,Stan's Kindle Review,"Overall I think Kindle is an excellent product and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I like the ability Kindle provides to download books almost instantly, store them, and then read them on a well-designed, compact and portable device. I especially like the ability to look up words in the built-in dictionary. Sometimes, however, I miss the ability to flip through pages as I would in a printed book."
4,kindle review,"Overall a good purchase and enjoying reading on my Kindle.Nice size, navigation buttons still take a little getting used to and sometimes difficult to re-navigate to the page I want or stopped at. Not intuitive like the Mac. New York Times download not nearly the experience as reading the full newspaper (no ads or color pix). Downloads are quick and easy. Major problem for me: I assumed I would be able to order any book that Amazon carried, which was most books. Instead you are limited to those they have chosen to put in Kindle format. I wanted Catcher in the Rye (nope) and Barry Mindow's con man book (no again). Oh, well...Maybe the selections might improve! Would hope they could eventually open up all books to downloading instead of just the most popular..."
4,Kindle Review,"Bought the Kindle primarily to use while traveling. Have found it very easy to use. It gives an experience almost identical to reading a regular book. You very quickly get use to hitting the paddles to turn the page and it becomes second nature. It is perfect for reading while on an airplane.The books are reasonably priced and very easy to select and purchase (almost too easy!). The Kindle seems a little too expensive. Considering I don't have to lug books onto planes and try to find the right book in paperback, I feel OK about the purchase and price.The wireless service that allows you to purchase books is great and very easy to use. The Kindle has a web browser build in that at this stage is rather clunky but serves the purpose of getting weather, sports scores and news."
4,Back cover problem,I love everything about my new kindle but there is one problem I've had since the purchase. Every time I take it out of it's bookcover the back of the kindle where the battery is located falls off. I need to snap it closed every time. Whats up with that?
1,does not meet my expectations,THere is know way at all to organize my readinings! It is acomplete waste of money and i had to sell it on ebay. please do not buy this product
1,$400!!!.....will wait for the price drop in 6 months....,"Great product, great idea....but $400! You have to be kidding. For that price, most people will pass, or buy an Ipod and like 30 books! Whoever priced this thing had no business degree. If they were smart, they would take a loss on it, price it at $150 and grow some market share. Make the maoney off the downloads, not the hardware. Poor poor decision. I think they will learn and drop price once the initial sales are lackluster."
3,cool tech toy but give me a book!,"This new device has some great features like dictionary look up, newspapers and magazines from everywhere, and it is extremely portable and great for travel. The downside is I love the way a new hardback book feels in my hands. I love it when you pick up a new book and the cover art jumps out at you, the pages smell new and fresh, a book is a substantial weight in my hand. A book can be a treasured friend and books are a tremendous part of our past and future. Books from a hundred years ago are still read by children at night before they go to bed and the wonderful timeless stories still leap off the page and fire the imagination just like they did when the book was first published a century earlier. What would the world be like without libraries full of shelf after shelf of books, just computers lined up on desks? Books are forever let's hang on to them!"
3,"Needs some improvements, but I like it.","The page forward and back bars are too large. You cannot handle the device, even in its cover without inadvertently paging one way or the other. It falls out of the cover too easy also. If the on/off buttons were on the ends like where the charger plugs or on top opposite the plug in, the whole device could be secured in its cover. Also, I am hoping for a color version that would include the cover art (which I miss with this device), and would allow for manga and graphic novels, a fast growing niche."
4,Oops! No Sprint service,"My husband got this for me for my birthday. Had some mixups on getting it and the rebate. I think I would really like it except we have no Sprint service in our area. I think Amazon should have a way to let potential buyers know this. We will have to hook up to the laptop to download books. I still have a few days of my 30 to decide whether I want to keep it or not. If I can get past the no Sprint service, I think I will really like it."
4,DIX FAMILY,"ENJOY THE KINDLE, OUR FAMILY OWNES THREE.BILL...AGE 69..SAYS...HOLDING THE KINDLE IS AWKWARD WITH THE PAGE TURNER BUTTONS ON THE SIDE. BUILT IN LIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.JUDY...AGE 66...SAYS... THE COVER ATTACHMENT COULD BE BETTER.LISA... AGE 17...SAYS...WOULD LIKE PAGE NUMBERS TO SHOW. SOME BOOKS I WANT (LIKE HARRY POTTER SERIES) ARE NOT AVAILABLE. HOPE SOME DAY YOU HAVE TEXT BOOKS ON THE KINDLE SO I DO NOT HAVE TO CARRY SO MANY BOOKS.WE ALL ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT OUR PURCHASE AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE BOOKS ARRIVE.HAVE A HAPPY KINDLE DAY."
2,"Bezos aimed for the iPod, but hit a pothole","I would love to praise the Kindle, because it is a great idea and I love Jeff Bezos. But it just doesn't work at several levels. The first 3 books I tried to buy (and they were common titles) were not available. Paperback size is not a good format for reading a newspaper. Mostly, it is hard to avoid hitting the wrong buttons and losing the page you are on. I think one might get used to holding the Kindle so as not to do this, but it was a pain. Also, we went on a trip and there were several places where we didn't have wireless reception, so I didn't get my newspaper and was unable to connect to the store. It's a great idea, but needs much more refinement. Also, the book cover was very cheaply made. Not good for a $400 item. Sorry, it's still at beta level!"
4,A handy divice,"A little difficult to turn on -- can't highlight specific words 9these are minor) -- the main problem for me is that there are not enough books available (I have tried to buy at least three, Amazon had them but not Kindle."
3,Prototype,"I would call this item a prototype for the future. The possibility of having one item that would hold a great number of books is exciting, especially if companies start considering academic books. However, the items build worries me. The alphabet seems unnecessary with a scroll wheel (like an apple ipod), and I would be afraid of damaging the screen.I absolutely love the fact that I would be able to see the screen in the light or the dark. But I heard that websites, online, show up choppy. I would trade the free wireless for a reasonable fee that included decent web site viewing cababilities and the ability to transfer over any document (word, etc) for free, even on my small income.Either way, I'm looking forward to what companies come out with in the future. This time, though, I think I'll pass."
2,"Cool idea, entirely too expensive","I just got this as a gift from the parents. Cool idea, I'm sure everyone has thought of this at one point or another.That being said, I'll never use this. My parents spent $400 on it, and then they want you to pay $10 for each book you read? This thing is entirely too costly. I tried sending a word doc to my kindle and it even tried charging me for that! This thing nickels and dimes you every which way it can. I understand $10 is a good price for a book, but not after you just spent $400 buying the device to read it."
2,The Kindle Potemkin Village,"I have just received the Kindle as a gift, and I could say a lot about what I like about the Kindle - which is quite a bit - but until they actually have a decent book list, they are doomed to failure. Many of the major authors of the 20th century are not represented at all - Faulkner, Bellows, Steinbeck, to name just a few. No Tolkien, in another genre. The book list is padded with junk no one will ever read - hence this is a ""Potemkin Village"" of an e-book device. They gloss over this fatal flaw but it will do them in soon if it is not fixed. I strongly recommend that you search the book list on line before buying."
3,It's ok,"I really wanted this and was glad to get it, but it is hard for me to read it.It is so you just can't see it clearly. If maybe it had a backlight or something so you could see the letters better"
5,Best Present Ever,"I received the Kindle for my birthday a few months ago and I have to say it is the best present. I carry it with me and download many books. I really believe this is the wave of the future....paperless and easy. I look forward to more authors and publishers sending their books out ""wireless""."
1,Poor customer service and a less than reliable device,I am one month out of my year warranty and last night my kindle froze. Nothing woud work despite my attempts to reset and reboot. When I contacted amazon for help they basically said that this kindle is out of warranty so despite the fact that the product seems to be defective I woud need to pay a $65.00 fee plus shipping and handling. A brand new kindle costs $79.00...According to the man that helped me this is a common problem and they have not yet resolved it. I understand that a warranty is a warranty I just expected more from this product as well as from this company. I loved my kindle so much but I am concerned that this a common problem and I don't want to make the same mistake twice. Does anyone have any advice or has anyone had better luck with reading devices from other companies?
3,Still doesn't replace my books...,"I like my Kindle, but I'm not a total convert yet. True, it's easier to travel with than my heavy books, but it's touchy and awkward to hold without hitting the ""next page"" or "" previous page"" levers (even when I followed directions and left the cover attached). Also, I didn't realize that I would have to turn it off for take offs and landings in the airplane, a small annoyance. I like the availablility of titles and the price and speed of downloading books, and the ability to sample a book before buying is great."
4,great but needs light,I bought this product in October. I absolutely love it. I read on the average of 15 to 20 books monthly and enjoyed the paperless and cheaper aspect of the books. The greatest is that the books are truly at your fingertips (let your fingers do the walking). The only draw back that I have is their is no installed light around the screen where their is truly a place for it. I have book lights. The updated version of this really needs a lighted screen when user needs it. That is my only draw back. I saw the new one out by Sony and I am glad I made this purchase instead of it.
4,excited but disappointed,"I love the innovation of the product, but was surprised to find how many titles are not available. I'm not just a New York bestseller reader. My subject interest is broad. Hope there is resolution soon, as well as academic text book availability."
4,Love it!,"I have enjoyed the Kindle since I received it a month ago. It is easy to use and the size is perfect to fit in a medium size purse. I take it everywhere I go.My only complaint is the prev and next buttons are a bit sensitive, so at times I advance by accident. Other than that, I LOVE KINDLE.Hopefully Amazon will get more new releases Kindle formatted soon!"
2,access to service. I,"Upon arriving in ND, zip code 58495 I decided to get another Kindal to use during my extended stay. Imagine my frustration upon receiving my 2nd Kindal that this area had almost no access to service! Had to drive 150 miles to even connect this device. Needless to say, anything in archives cannot be accessed from my present location."
4,I love it.,"This device is great. My only criticism is that it is too easy to inadvertantly turn pages because of the configuration of the bars on the device. I understand this problem has been largely corrected on the 2nd generation Kindle. I especially like the wireless connection to the book store and being able to sample books, magazines and blogs before buying. The device is easy to use, and the screen is easy on the eyes. I'm hooked."
3,kindle,"KINDLE IS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT HAS ITS DRAWBACKS, MOSTLY IN THE FORMATS THAT CAN BE LOADED INTO THE PLAYER. I HAD EBOOKS THAT I HAD PURCHASED IN THE PAST FROM DIFF EBOOK SELLERS AND SOME WERE PDF WHICH CANNOT BE LOADED INTO MY KINDLE. I FIND THAT IT IS ALSO TOO EASY TO HIT THE BARS ON THE SIDES AND TURN PAGES BY MISTAKE. I ACTUALLY WISH I HAD PURCHASED THE SONY...."
5,my first 3book reader,I am a retired USAF officer and a retired Mental Health Professional. I enjoy reading but library space is getting out of hand. I bought a kindle2 and have enjoyed reading once again. I have had no trouble downloading ebooks on the whisper net even though I live on a timberfarm back in the woods of the Mississippi Hills. Thanks a lot to the makers of kindle2.Ray WilsonUSAF Retired
1,Bummed in Alaska,"After seeing the Kindle on the Oprah show, I immediately ordered it. It arrived quickly and with no shipping charge, but...the wireless network needed for the Kindle is not available in Alaska. So, I had to send my wonderful toy back.I now know that the wireless information is located in the online product description (if you keep scrolling down). Wouldn't it would be better service if Amazon would warn Alaska buyers before sending the product?Couldn't an optional wireless internet feature be added?"
2,Kindle vs. Sony,"I must say I enjoy my Sony 505 much better than the Kindle. The books are cheaper and with the new 'light' I can read anytime anywhere. I use my sony just for books and have no need for the newspaper or blogs as I have a computer at home and a laptop for that. I wish I would not have waisted (my opinion) the money on this. I find the Sony and its new cover w/light a much better product for the money. I am an avid reader and find that the fonts do not tire the eyes. I would recommend the Sony for folks who need the book for books only. If you want an all-in-one well.....for what its worth, save your money until they get a 2nd or even a 3rd generation."
2,Review of Browsing Kindle,"Although I love the Kindle, browsing for books to buy is tedious bordering on impossible. Leafing though thousands of pages, with 6 books per page, soon discourages me. Then there are the six or eight repeats of the same title to go through. I like older books, especially older mysteries, but there is no way to browse. If it were possible to skip to location ""***"", as we can do when locating a page in a book, that would improve browsing."
4,Paper and glue,"I have shelves overflowing with books, and I've taken a couple of classes where I learned to make blank books, so I'm definitely a ""book person."" BUT, that said, the smell of paper and glue are wildly overrated...the Kindle simply ROCKS! Books are about stories, words, and mental pictures, and the Kindle delivers. Love it. (Even with its eensy flaws.) Get one. Now.That is all."
4,great product,I like my kindle a lot. I do find it awkward to use the on and off switches. It takes awhile to figure out how to hold the kindle in order to press next page. All in all I am quite pleased.
5,Kindle Bookreader,"The Kindle is a wonderful device--one of the few with potential to improve, significantly, the quality of my life. I bought it to eliminate the physical clutter associated with my daily paper newspaper subscriptions. (I have never been willing to haul around a laptop computer, in order to read the various online editions. By contrast, the Kindle is small enough to travel in my purse, yet has a screen ideal for reading). Given the Amazon Kindle online store, there is no lack of reading material possibilites, with instant availablility. I am adding material, as my budget allows."
3,great device.book prices horrible!!,i was just looking at a new lee child book.the hardcover edition is cheaper than the kindle edition.is it possible that it is cheaper to produce and ship a hardcover book than it is to produce a download?
1,Beware,"Beware, Amazon charges more for some books on Kindle than it does to buy the hard copy. How does this make sense? A fully digital version of this book that will be read on a device you paid for is substantially more expensive than a hard copy that requires trees to be cut down and turned into paper, printing, binding, and shipping? Is this price fixing in digital publishing?"
1,Does not work for people with poor eyesight,"I specifically chose the kindle because of its large font size option. This was for someone who was unable to read normal print size. While the larger print size worked, the small size of the controls and keyword made the kindle unusable."
3,My Dead Kindles,"I was so pumped about my Kindle I think I must have sold 20-30 for Amazon just with my raves. Until it died 15 months after I bought it. There is a 90 day guarantee. So I figured lightning can't strike twice, right? So I purchased a refurbished one and it lasted all of 6 months. Again, 90 day guarantee. So now, as much as I love my kindle, I am thinking about not replacing it. There are too many slick gizmos on the market now to throw more good money after bad."
3,"better, but still not great","The Kindle is the best ebook so far. It is light and easy to read. However, it is still too slow to turn pages; the pages should turn instantly. It is too hard to navigate through the book. You should be able to access the book chapters and the pages should turn as quickly as flipping through a paperback.Keep working on it!"
1,3rd Kindle 3 and still have to reboot to use it...everytime,"There is something seriously wrong with 1) the device and 2) customer service. I've sent two kindles back in the last three months...each time for the same reason....I have to reboot the device to read...its absolutely frustrating now that I have my 3rd and it is not working. I've asked customer service if there is a problem users in densely populated areas are having and they have no answer other than ""we'd be glad to send you a new device"". I was told by one customer service person that there is a 3% defect rate...I can't believe it given my experience. I love the concept, size, screen but if in the end it doesn't work I'm done...this is a YUGO. Don't buy it."
5,"There are two in our home. 1st generation, the one that gets a little grief...... is great. Get used to it.","There are two in our home. 1st generation, the one that gets a little grief...... is great. Get used to it. The 3rd generation my wife reads is great too. Both are dependable and take a bit of getting used to. Even the 1st generation can be held and munipulated comfortably. We have carried them all over the country and read them in many different light conditions and not ever been disapointed. People see them and ask, and are always amazed how well they can see them. I like to fold open my cover shell, make a stand with it, then rest the unit against it, simply touching next to turn the page. Easier than than a book."
1,Don't buy,"They don't tell you that you can only download books from Amazon. It will not work with any other source such as the public library. I am returning mine, big disappointment."
2,user friendly,the Kindle itself is not user friendly. The books on Kindle has lot of mistakes.I am not happy with the books or the kindle.
3,I prefer the SONY reader,"Tried the Kindle and loved it, then tried the Sony PRS-650 and was amazed by its awesomeness. Sold the Kindle, got the PRS-650."
5,Kindle,"I love this thing, I do not have to wear glasses anymore when I read. It is not big and bulky, it fits into my purse so I can take it anywhere. I don't have books piling up in my house anymore. I just wish there were more titles available but I am sure that's coming."
4,I am IN LOVE!,"I fell in love with my Kindle straight away! I cannot imagine life without it. It is so convenient, I use it ALL the time. The battery has a very long life. The one thing I would like to see is some sort of ""backlight"". I bought the attachable,flexible LED light for when I am reading in bed. It works great! Oh, and a clock, a clock would be a nice addition too."
5,the Amazing Kindle,"From someone who loves to feel the print and crinkle of a newspaper or dog-eared pages in a great book, I have come over to the Kindle-side! This is an amazing invention that I wanted no part of from the start. However, the ease of use, automated downloading and note features make life easy and entertaining, needless to say, my vocabulary has increased with the dictionary function. Each morning I now turn on my Kindle and before I can pour a cup of coffee, the days NY Times is downloaded and enjoyed. No longer going out in the freezing cold to get the newspaper.Thanks Kindle!"
4,Kindle E-book,"This device is great! It has a few minor problems, but none that are serious. Its comfortable to use at home as well as when traveling. I even bought a book when I was sitting in the basement of a hospital building. This book does everything it promised."
5,Great for the Elderly,I love the Kindle. It is so easy to change the fonts. I haven't been able to read books due to my eyesight changing in about 3 years now. Everything is so user friendly. It is worth every penny!!!
4,Book prices misleading,"I have owned my Kindle for some time and love it. So far it has worked flawlessly. I do have a problem with the price of books. Perhaps I misunderstood, but from the advertising I assumed that the price of books would top out at $9.99. Yesterday I tried to download a recent release and the price was $20.00. Quite a difference and had I realized earlier that prices could go that high, I might not have bought it. The price difference is the reason for the 4 stars, otherwise I give it 5 stars.For changes in the future I would recommend back lighting on the screen and that large bar on the right side can be a pest at times."
4,Love my Kindle,I have been an avid e-reader for years using my Palm devices. When I decided to combine my phone & PDA on a windows mobile device the e-reader was ok but too small. I've been busy reading again since I bought the Kindle.
5,Fun to read again,"I am 57 years of age, as a result I have used reading glasses for years. The Kindle allows me to read again without glasses. This is worth a lot to me. The font is very clear, and I can read for longer periods of time.I read a lot of science fiction. Do I wish I could get more titles on the Kindle -- of course. But I believe the number of titles will increase as more people adopt the Kindle or another e-reading device.I am very satisfied that I purchased mine now"
3,Poor battery,"The Kindle is an excellent product but beware of the battery. Many of the batteries, like mine, are failing at 4-6 months. I am getting about half the battery life after only four months use. I have ordered another battery but for the cost of the Kindle it should have a higher quality battery. At $20 each, you may have another $20-$60 owners tax to pay each year."
1,Warning to potential purchasers,"After you have bought books to read on this device, Amazon can delete them from your Kindle in your own home without your permission."
5,THE BEST ITEM I HAVE PURCHASED MAYBE EVER !,I PURCHASED MY KINDLE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! AS A PERSON WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IT IS A PLEASURE TO READ AGAIN BECAUSE I CAN HOLD THE KINDLE WITH EASE. IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT MAKES IT EASY TO HOLD FOR A PERSON WITH PAINFUL HANDS. I ALSO LIKE THE ABILITY TO HAVE LARGE PRINT (BAD EYES) WITH EVERY BOOK I READ. I HAVE ALSO FOUND MY READING SPEED HAS INCREASED AS I CONTINUE TO READ WITH THE DEVICE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO EVERYONE. SURE IT'S A LITTLE PRICEY INITIALLY BUT THE USE I HAVE ALREADY GOT OUT OF IT HAS MADE UP FOR THE PRICE. A+++
5,BILL ERB'S REVIEW OF KINDLE,I read in bed at night and find this product comfortable and easy to read. I purchased the light that attaches to the Kindle and it works fine.
5,Satisfaction w/Kindle,"I spend considerable time in Africa and, in the past, my link to the outside world that kept me sane was WorldSpace radio. For this trip to W. Africa I am now finding that the Kindle is filling that need. The satellite for this area is not functioning properly (for WS radio) and even if it was I am sure I would be reading many more books than normal! In addition to liking the unit itself I have found the Kindle Support to be first rate and the way I can download to my computer and transfer to the Kindle is so quick and easy! I am truly satisfied."
4,Surprisingly Good,I was skeptical about the Kindle and tried to find every review available before I decided to purchase. Sure there are some things I would like to see changed like addition of folders for books and better handling of technical material but these can be added in a future software update. I love my Kindle.
5,The Kindle is really amazing and fun.,"I've had my Kindle a month and am loving it. My skeptical husband loves it too now that's he's tried it. I guess we'll have to buy another one for him soon! I think it is so much easier to hold while reading than a book, expecially large books. So far I haven't downloaded magazines or newspapers but I have tried an audio book. Frankly I'd rather use an MP3 player for audio but having it available will be great when traveling. I'd like to be able to put pdf books on it since the library has resource books available in that format but all in all I am very pleased with my Kindle."
1,No Customer Support,"I really wanted to like this product. However, after carefully reading the introductory material, I was pretty much unable to navigate anywhere in this product. It was also virtually unable to connect to my router's wifi. I have a pc. But all of my own, wife,s and daughter's Iphones and I pads connect just great to wifi. But the Kindle, I had to turn off and turn on each time I wanted to connect. Then, I bought a ""story"" for $1.99 from Amazon. It was the tiniest short story! I thought it was a ""novel.""I tried to find a customer support number. Figured I needed about a two minute primer on this device. But, I couldnt find a customer support phone number after looking for 15 minutes and typing in a question online. Overall, I just returned this product."
1,Got a Lemon!,"My Kindle stopped working several months after I bought it. I thought it was just needing a new battery (already?!?!) and the new battery worked for about five minutes and then blew, too. It took MONTHS and MONTHS to even get the new battery! I'm so darned disappointed! I had received the Kindle as a retirement gift and looked forward to having some quiet time to finally enjoy reading. That was a whole lot of money wasted! The warranty is expired because I've had to deal with other more pressing issues and did not have time to deal with this huge disappointment. Has anyone else had this problem with their Kindle?"
5,Review from a owner,"I have had my Kindle for about 2 months and am in love with it. I have traveled with it, read it on the beach, in cars, and everywhere. It fits into my purse so I have instant reading material right at hand. It really does download in 30 to 60 seconds! Print is very readable and adpatable to all sizes. I would be lost without it!"
3,Getting Close But Not Quite There Yet,No PDF support! Big problem for those of us that travel and need to review PDF documents attached to eMails. Controlling content may be useful for some but a more universal approach will probably yield significant sales.
1,boom voices of the sixties,"I purchased this book today. I was told it was in my kindle at that moment. So far I have not found this to be true. How may I reach you, amazon? to tell you so."
3,Kindle is kind of booring,"I have no Idea in this age of digital electronics, how some one come up with a black and white screen device with such a high price. Most of the text books, leave aside news paper and magazine etc, uses some kind of color images , illustration etc..but with this device its all black and white."
1,Way Too Much Money,"When The Kindle hits $150.00 I'll buy one. By that time I expect it will be even better as well as make more sense monetarily. I don't mind spending $400 on a PDA and I have a few at that level. But this is bascally a one-trick, dedicated device. I just do not see a book reader, no matter how great it may be, being worth that much money to most consumers."
3,KINDLE,I WISH THEY MADE A KINDLE FOR THE BLIND WHERE IT WOULD ACTUALLY READ THE PAPER OR BOOK TO YOU. HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE?
1,Beware,"I have a kindle that cost over $300.00 2 years ago. It is now a paperweight, it will not connect any longer and Amazons policy is. Go buy another!So if you have enough money to justify this wasteful lifestyle have at it. I do not.Very disappointed in Amazon.Spread the word - these guys did me wrong, don't set yourself up for the same disappointment."
4,Really Enjoying It,"I decided to buy a Kindle after reviewing a few of the other devices of this sort and deciding that I like what the Kindle had to offer. I've used it now for several books and many short stories and whenever I switch back to a paper book, I keep missing it. At some point, I'll probably stop reading paper all together.The only real downside that I have noticed about this device is it's lack of being able to group authors together. I have quite a few individual short stories by a few different authors and they are all listed out seperately on the Kindle's menu. I wish there were a way that you could group them together in one folder, under the author's name and open it when you choose rather then viewing them all at the same time. I have six pages (at the moment) in my table of contents and it's mostly because of short stories.Other than that, I am completely happy with my purchase and hope to continue reading on it for years to come."
1,Waiting for APPLE,"I was all ready to order one as a Xmas present but, after reading the reviews, I'm willing to wait a while longer for APPLE to do it right. Too bad."
2,Bummed at Amazon hijacking my computer time after time after time...,"I am so SICK of Amazon hijacking my computer time after time after time, every time I sign onto Amazon, and taking me kicking and screaming to look at Kindle! Kindle! Kindle! Electronics and Kindle! when I TRIED SO HARD to select BOOKS!! Over and over and over and over and over and over and over, and if I wanted to look at, review, shop for Kindle, I know where to find it! The truth is, since they're been trying to shove it down my throat, and I suppose every other loyal customer's throat, I'm NOT EVEN INTERESTED!! Amazon, wake up! Grow up~!!!!!!!!! Kindle is NOT why millions sign onto your web site! Quit jerking us around! Or, I'll (we'll) just find ANOTHER booksite that respects us, and doesn't try to force our hand! Now, QUIT IT! YOU HEAR?? (I tried to comment via the question/comment mechanism, and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. Amazon, GET A CLUE!!!!!!!!!)Dr. James Hufferd"
1,Expense a Problem,"I think the price is too prohibitive. I couldn't get my boss to okay such an expense. He would rather I purchase a book that is tangeble. Otherwise it looks useful. Maybe someday I can read my journals, texts, and other association document on it. But for now, not so much."
1,"Sorry Amazon, but offer a dark trim...","Cons:* High price* Bright trim that makes my eyes hurt just looking at it on the website, at least offer a dark gray or blackAmazon obviously doesn't want my business."
4,Expensive,"Since I read a great deal, this product looked very interesting. It certainly would be easier to carry than some of the books I carry around with me but the price is way too much for the convenience it offers. Perhaps when the price goes down a bit..."
1,Why dont you buy a Tablet PC?,"Just add another $400 or so and you can get a nice Tablet PC which may be little slower comparing to other Tablet PCs but much more powerful than Kindle. If you can spend more, you can get an extremely light weight Tablet PCs such as the ones Fujitsu makes. I simply don't understand those people who are willing to spend $400 for the device that let you just read books, magazines, newspapers and nothing else."
2,"too big, expensive and black & white","I have been reading e-books for years and was excited when I saw the introduction of the Kindle, but upon further consideration have decided not to buy. It is too large, expensive and I don't like that the display is black and white. I also don't like that you need a worm light to read in the dark. I much prefer reading on my old Palm Zire. It is small, has a bright color display screen, and you can change the background to a darker color (or black) for nighttime reading. It's easy on the eyes and convenient to use. I don't mind having to sync with my computer to access my books. The only complaint is that the charge doesn't last as long as the Kindle. I would definitely be interested in a Kindle if: 1.) a smaller package; 2.) less expensive; 3.) color display (especially important for pictures, if there are any); 4.) backlighting for nighttime reading; and 5.) cheaper books."
4,The future of print,"OK, this is it! I have seen the future of print. Once you have one of these things, you can see the paradigm shift that will eventually make other print media obsolete. Goodbye newspaper and it's expensive delivery mechanisms, etc.The device isn't perfect, ergonomically and otherwise. But, it is pretty darn good. The future reading devices may be somewhat different -- multifunctional computers perhaps, but this e-Ink display, the wireless delivery via cell phone network -- this is where we are going, and it is great to see Amazon taking the lead with such a usable device that is encouraging people to read again.I love my new Kindle.Way"
5,nontechie in love with Kindle,"This will be short and very sweet. I have had no other type of e-reader and that is because I really didn't know about them. I love reading and have a huge library of hardback books. I have been an avid reader since grade school and now I am in my 60's and my eyes are OLD. Along comes Kindle and I can go to my room, no TV and read to my heart's content. I have also found the tabs on each side for page turning were a bother at first, but you get used to it. My husband and I do a lot of traveling in our motor home and boy has the Kindle been wonderful. I can be out in the boonies and if there is cell service I can download a book of my choosing. I have been traveling at times and have run out of reading material. So the Kindle is the answer for me. I have purchased many items on Amazon and have always been satisfied. Now with the Kindle I will always find Amazon where ever I go. All my friends know about my Kindle also. Thanks, Kay Barents"
5,Can a lifelong reader take the plunge and go totally digital?,"I have always been comfortable in my room with my four bookcases and my collections of favorite authors. However, I have gone past age 65, and collecting doesn't motivate me as much as it used to. I just want to read. I've read between 15 and 20 novels on my Kindle, and I have become a fan of this e-reader. (The process of clicking to purchase a book and then watching the download to my Kindle fascinates me. It's mezmerizing!)I have just about decided to order a second Kindle. I am comfortable with having my digital library of books stored on my Kindle and at Amazon. I am confident that I can contine to maintain my trusty laptops and my Amazon account, so I don't really need to have dead-tree volumes any longer. I can certainly find enough to read among the Kindle offerings. I've talked myself into it. I'm going to order another Kindle. Do I need another? No. Do I want another? Yes."
2,great if it had voice!,"I think this would be a great device for people who aren't exactly good readers if you added just a few more services. For instance, people with dyslexia would benefit from being able to choose different screen colors. Others with difficulty would benefit if the Kindle read out loud while highlighting each word so that people who find it difficult to remain on task could enjoy the book also. I think you are moving in the right direction. Just don't forget the special needs people!!Thanks,Carrie"
3,Biased titles?,"""God is Not Great"", Bill Clinton's ""Giving"", etc. etc. Gee, it seems the Kindle forces you to read what Amazon wants you to read, from one narrow viewpoint. Thanks, but I will stick with printed books and freedom of choice."
1,"Love the Idea, Not the Reality","Black and white???? No color???? I like the idea of getting content on the fly. However, until the reader is less expensive, and provides color. . . no way!"
2,Is it even cost effective?,"The device is $400If you figure that you will save an average (according to the Amazon Video) of $5 per book, it will take about 80 books to ""pay"" off your purchase. 80 books at $10 a pop is $800 bucks + $400 for Kindle = $1200.A. Have a cool new piece of technology to read your books = $1200orB. Buy a new book case and 80 new paper-books to fill the book case = $1200I know what my choice is."
2,Needs more,"It looks exciting but I will not be buying one until:-it has better design, it is so ugly-it's international--can handle special characters, buy books in any language-pdf-is cheaper-textbooks!!! (if it offered textbooks in the languages I needed I would buy it now at that usurious price)-has a better (international) selection of books available, as well as papers and magazines-it isn't drmAs it is I love to read and have no problems reading from a screen, but I will definitely be waiting a few years until the above is accomplished. I wouldn't mind if Apple ran with this, either, their design is so good."
2,Love it but i am having 2nd thoughts,Had a Kindle for one month and the screen started acting up. Half the screen went blank and the other half showed text from the book i'd been reading. Tried resetting. No good. Was able to get replacement. Made me very happy but concerned that I'd only had it for a short time before it went nutty. How long before this one does the same?My daughter has the same problem with hers. She had the device turned off but the screen still reads Amazon Kindle. Gonna have to call tech support again!!! #%$@%^
5,Perfect!,"I purchased this item for my husband and he has hardly put it down. It is easy to read, ergonomically friendly, and simple for him to add books too either from Amazon or online. He has become a Kindle evangelist - he sells one almost anytime he goes out. If only they had a program where he could get credit for the people he sells on the device he would never have to buy another book!"
3,"so smart, yet, I am waiting.","I love to come to Amazon to look for stuff. It has everything. When I see kindle, I have doubt, but after the video clips, I love it.But I guess I will wait for the next generation, since it has no color, how can you read a magazine without color? Beside, the newspaper and magainze are not large selection at the moment. I guess I will wait. ^_^"
1,REALLY dissapointed,"I bought this for my father. The ideal gift for someone without regular access to bookstores or a post office. He lives in a remote part of Australia.However, while I can buy the device I cannot buy the content. The Kindle books are only for Americans. Really ? I can order the physical book in Australia and have this delivered but not the electronic version.What a farce.I'll return the device, but this has been an (extremely) unsatisfactory experience."
5,"love it, love it, love it!","I love to read and this item was right on! It fits in my purse, whereas some books don't. It goes wherever I go now. So if I have to wait anywhere I have something to occupy my mind. Text size is a big plus also. And I'm paying much less for books now, saving trees now, and not having to make a place for my books. The only con is it is too easy to turn the page when you are holding it."
5,Longtime Ereader Who Doesn't Miss Her Backlit Screen,"My old ebook reader finally died, so my husband bought me a Kindle. I was a little hesitant because I love to read in the dark in bed. I didn't want an ebook reader unless it was backlit. Well, I am hooked on the Kindle. I just attach a book light and read away. The Kindle is very easy on the eyes. Amazon makes it so easy to use. Help our environment and save paper - buy one today. You won't even miss holding an actual book in your hand."
4,If you're an avid reader highly recommended,"Pro: I recommend this product for anyone who reads a lot and/or travels. The battery life, thanks to the e-ink screen, is great and allows for reading in all types of lighting including the sun.Con: The refresh rate could be better and the overall button interface is a bit first generation."
4,So far so good,"I got my Kindle for Christmas. So far so good. Few small things that bugs me but most of my experience is positive.The good - It is simple, it works as advertized. A little on the expensive side but I took it to Canada, worked in cold climate, dropped it in the snow and it stillwork fine.The things that bugs me - The design is somehow not very comfortable to me if you use it without the book cover. I have big hands so it may explain why. The lower corners are a bit sharp to me.From the post I read, this is a great book reader, not a computer or a surfing tool.If you are an avid reader, this is a great tool. It is simple enough to give it to Mom - Dad and evenmaybe Grandma.. if she is a tad technical.It was a present and a very appreciated one.Good reading"
4,Love my Kindle!,I absolutely love my Kindle. The wireless connection is great especially when I'm waiting at the train station and need to download a new book. The screen is easy to read and I've read it for 3-4 hours at a time without having eye strain like I do with the computer screen. The two main pains are the Next Page button on the right hand side. It gets in my way when I'm picking up the Kindle so I often accidentally hit it. I also with there was some sort of light option so I can read when I'm somewhere without good lighting.I tried out the Sony ebook reader at Borders and definitely preferred the Kindle.
5,Kindle,"I found out about this product on Oprah and took advantage of the $50 coupon on my purchase. It is easy to use and reading on the screen is clear with no eye strain. There are thousands of products to download including newspapers, books, etc. Adding the SD card expands the memory dramatically for minimal cost. I'd highly recommend the SD card. Amazon emails items that might be of interest and specials frequently. It is portable, durable, and easy to use. Downloads take just seconds. When we travel we have access to numerous books without actually taking the books with us. I would highly recommend the Kindle."
4,Ease of Newspaper Reading,"On a daily basis, I appreciate my new Kindle most for reading the news. There's no need to go outside in the cold and snow to collect the day's paper -- at least not to get my first news ""fix"" of the day. Instead the day's edition (of the WA Post) is ready and waiting at the bedside table. Even with minimal light, it's an easy read from bed.In addition, I'm convinced that I'm reading more news AND spending less time at it than before -- whether from a print edition or on the web -- because there are far fewer distractions to divert ones attention.I also find it a great way to read fiction and cope with a lack of available space in my bookcases. I'm less enthusiastic about its usefulness with books that I want to browse or that cry out for frequent references to earlier material."
2,Are there plans to increase the service coverage?,"I was about ready to order this product, and even had it in my shopping cart. I paused and went back to read most of the fine print, and I learned that my address does not have coverage for the ""Whisper Net"" download service. The product sounds great, but not if I cannot download where I live and work. Either the coverage area has to improve, or it needs a Wi-Fi option. It is not really clear on the site that many geographical areas cannot use this, even though they do have cell phone coverage from some networks.Kurt in zip code 53821"
3,Mobi and PDFs,"Kurt wrote, ""The Kindle supports MOBI files. It took me five minutes on Google to find the Mobi site, download their desktop software, and convert a PDF file to Mobi. Problem solved.""Unfortunately, Mobi does not have a Mac version.Amazon would have a home run if it supported all eBook formats and lowered the price."
2,no service for product,"I loved my kindle, then a small splash of wine dropped on it. Now it no longer works. I e mailed amazon, they responded promptly that I had to call them. I did just that and their answer was too bad, nothing can be done. They would not give me a refund on the books that I had bought the day before it broke. Nor do they service their own product. I strongly recommend waiting to purchase this until they are able to fix it when it breaks..."
4,Lovely but needs redesign,"Both my wife and I are enjoying this. It's light, very readable, stylish, and such a convenience when you want a book now! Here's an improvement that needs to be made and one I'm surprised Amazon didn't figure out before the introduction. The sidebars on each side are really in the way. Where do you hold this thing?? So often I accidentally hit the 'next page', 'previous page', or 'back' bars. They run along both sides with nowhere to conveniently put your hands. In trying to make things so easy, you've made it more difficult! Dont' worry about left-handers. They've been living in a right-handed world all their lives..they can cope. Put three buttons at the bottom of the screen (preferably on the right hand side) and let it go at that. You have to be able to hold this thing someplace. My wife has taken this thing away from me, but I don't think I'll get another until you fix this. Please be prompt since I want one."
2,Mine was defective,"I love the idea of it and was enjoying using it. I would like to see changes in the placement and size of the ""next page"" and ""previous page"" buttons. It was a little hard to hold it without inadvertently hitting one of those buttons. The biggest problem was that mine was defective. It wouldn't turn on even when the battery was fully powered. I had to hit reset each time, and then on/off many times before it would come back. It was a dud. I'm going to wait for the next incarnation, if there is one."
2,$400 for black and white?,"This is a joke, right? Who in their right mind is going to spend that sort of cash on this gadget? $40 perhaps.Screen is too small. Is too bulky. Isn't in color.What's the point?Will be the latest ebook failure..."
2,My Kindle Doesn't Work,"I just got my Kindle out of the box and I could not get it to download any of the books i ordered. I then was going to email Kindle support when I found an email from them telling me that my Kindle was not registered at shipment and they don't know why, but to contact them as soon as I got it and to give them the serial number. I did that and then they told me that there was ""A known network error"" that they were correcting and that my Kindle would be bricked for at least 1 more day. The only good things about this is that they are on the ball enough that they knew about the problem before me, and for my troubles they gave me a $30 kindle store credit (yay). I'm giving Kindle support 5 stars for being on the ball, but I'm giving my Kindle a 2 star rating overall for shipping me a brick."
2,"If You Like the Feel of a Book, This is Not the Toy for You","I received this as a lovely, thoughtful gift from someone who knew I loved books dearly. It weighs less than a trade paperback and the text looks as much like the real thing as it possibly can. But all too quickly I realized how much I missed turning pages, underlining, truly using a book that I love, and then having it on my bookshelf as a proud trophy when I'm done. There is no substitute for this.In addition, the resemblance to book text is also the unit's downfall: it only shows grayscale images, and so any books adapted to kindle that have color photos (books you might actually want to carry around in electric format) are completely unreadable via this medium.I ended up returning my Kindle in exchange for an Acer Aspire One netbook, which costs almost exactly the same amount."
3,Pop Culture on Toast,"Like ""educational TV"" Kindle has succumbed to presenting the essence of literary claptrap gleaned from book sales. Significant and serious books are not to be found. Market values are seldom right in literature. Is there no one serious at Kindle? The only redeeming quality is the availability of Gutenberg for down loading."
1,The Kindle bookstore inventory is not good for me,"I thought this would be an exciting product and immediately placed my order; but then I realized that almost every book that I am interested in could not be found in the Kindle book store. The books I researched were #1 sellers; like 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People', 'Journey to the source', 'Pulling your string', etc. So I decided not to buy it now. Hopefully in the future it will have more variety."
1,kindle,It's a nice electronic device! But the only thing is I can't use it! I live in the Caribbean and you have to be connected with sprint to download books on the kindle wireless! I even tried with the USB cable that comes with the kindle! That doesn't work either!
2,KINDLE REVIEW,"I WAS STARTLED TO FIND THAT INSTEAD OF GETTING THE FULL BOOK, IT IS ABRIDGED AND A LOT OF THINGS RE LEFT OUT.....ALSO, IT IS HARD TO HANDLE WITHOUT ACCIDENTLY TURNING PAGES OR GETTING LOST .....I AM HIGJHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE KINDLE."
5,Senior reader,"My new Kindle is my favorite ""toy"". I've shown it to all my friends and family, and they are clearly envious. Both my husband and I spend most evenings reading (having found television generally a waste of time). The Kindle guarantees immediate access to whatever I'm in the mood to read. I often have more than one book under way, and now they are conveniently located in one lightweight package. I especially enjoy the variable print size since I can now read without my glasses. Only one problem...I won't share it with my husband. I may have to get him one for his birthday!"
4,Love it! Hope the book selection increases soon,"Received mine last week and have been enjoying it each day since. Great for reading books and it's very easy on the eyes. The book selection is quite large although I'm hoping to see many more added in the coming months. Being able to order a book you want and then enjoying it a minute later is really awesome. I found the device is not that good for reading newspapers, though, as the screen is a bit too small for that. All around, a great device. With a bigger selection, I'ld give it 5 stars."
4,Could Be Better,"I really like this but 2 things make it a pain. The most important is Sprint or whisper net stinks. I have had it almost a month and had to drive 2 hours from home to download a book, have not been able to download since. Also no place to hold the Kindle comfortabably without hitting next or previous page. For the price should be able to connect to any wireless to download. Cathy from rural Michigan"
3,"Great, but ....","Fun and interesting device. I do find a problem holding it when I am in relaxed positions; i.e. in bed, on the sofa. I find that I change pages and go back unintentionally as I juggle the device which has fallen out of the cover. Does not need large bars for page forward to occupy such valuable positions on both sides of the device. Needs redesign to allow for a better holding position."
3,"Close, but still needs refinement; DOWNGRADE TO 2 STARS","I bought my kindle about 6 months ago. It is okay, the screen needs more contrast, and the paddles are poorly placed, but it _is_ convenient, and the prices of the books were good. More lately, I am finding that the prices are the same or just slightly less than the paperback. This is not good. With the paperback I can loan it to my wife, and keep it for years. No so with the kindle. I am finding that I choose not to buy books for my kindle and buy the paperback instead.Bummer."
3,Not enough areas to hold it without pages turning all the time,"So, far, I like the Kindle; however, it's quite frustrating to have so many places that turn pages & not enough places to place your hands so this doesn't happen.I know there are many things that the Kindle can do but I haven't taken the time to look into that area as yet.I'm going on my first trip over Thanksgiving & taking it on the plane as I think it's a lot more convenient than carrying a book."
1,Jonathan Ive of Apple - Help!,"I am a gadget freak and tend to be an early adopter of cool new things (Toyota Prius, Apple iPhone, etc) - but this product creates absolutely no desire for me beyond its interesting concept.Kindle could really use the Apple design touch. The Kindle is just plain ugly. I think I'll wait for Apple's version..."
1,Can't xfer/share/etc....,"bunk!read several articles about this amazing new reading device....i call shananagins on this....it states you can not xfer or share what you download from this device to other devices or people or pc's.this is by far the most pathetic restriction next to the amount of music issues similar in nature.if i buy the darn stuff, i want to be able to do what i want with it. period!!!!if all you want to charge me is a measly $0.01 for a book to DL to the device, then i would go for it.but for the prices they want for the books and not be able to share is BS.dont buy - keep buying real books instead of this...."
3,My Wallet Hurts.,"I've never seen, touched, or used a Kindle; however, I have seen, touched, and used the $400.00 I'd pay for one. Personally, I can think of plenty of ways I'd rather spend that $400.00. While I am excited about the technology and convenience a Kindle provides, I will wait until they drop down to the $99.00 to $150.00 range.Buyer beware, if you leave your Kindle on the bus, I will gladly take it!"
5,Love the Kindle,"From one who has been an avid reader for close to 70 years - the Kindle has given me a new lease on reading. Because of a torn rotator cuff, I've only been able to hold a ""real"" book for a short time, but the Kindle has made it easy for me to read again. I'm currently enjoyingAntony and Cleopatra: A Novel (Masters of Rome), a fairly large, heavy book, which I've taken with me on Kindle to the dentist's office, to lunch, wherever I go. I've praised the Kindle to everyone I know. I like the availability of so many books and the ease of downloading, the ability to change font size, the built-in dictionary, and so many other features. In short, I'm delighted with the purchase and the product.I'd also recommend buying theM-edge Genuine Leather Executive Case for Amazon Kindle (Red)since it serves to carry not only the Kindle, but also a few extras such as lunch money, driver's license, credit card. Saves carrying a purse in many situations."
4,New Kindle Owner,i really enjoy reading books on my kindle. it is very simple to operate and i like all of the features. do not try to read your kindle when it is in the leather cover that was provided...it falls out of the cover. it is good for storing your kindle and putting it in your briefcase or suitcase. this is the only disappointment i have with the kindle.
4,Kindle review,"I am enjoying my new purchase, the instrucitons were easy to follow, and the product did what it promised. My kindle froze while I was reading the directions, I called the customer help line and they fixed me up right away. I have 2 small problems. 1. The back cover comes off easily and often. I find it difficult to connect the kindle to the reading cover. 2. There is no built in light for nighttime reading.Thank you."
3,Wait a few years till its mainstream,"Good prodeuct, but most of the books I wanted were not in this digital format. I was still having to buy books in hard/soft cover. Most publishers still do not offer their books for this product. I received it for Christmas and I sold it on Ebay."
2,"Too much money, too little marketing sense","Way too expensive for the market it has targeted itself towards. My old iPod will do everything that this does and the books are free!! If Amazon is serious about this format, they need to practically give these things away. Under $100 would be a perfect entry level price for the masses. Charge what you want for the accessories, you need to get these into the consumers hands in a big way. Now onto the books. That is where the real money is to be made. The more users you have, the greater the profit from the book sales. Get your head into the new age, it is the content that makes the profit, not the hardware."
3,"I like the concept, but...","I love the concept of an electronic reader like this. This technology has a lot of promise in my opinion. But to me it seems a bit expensive considering what it does. You can buy a cheap PDA or phone that can do much more than this thing can. Can you back up all of the books & content that you have purchased? It concerns me that you could build up a big library of books, magazines, etc. and one day somebody steals it out of your car or something. Will you be able to reclaim all of your data? Why not store the data in some common format so people could back up their stuff and possibly access it with a standard PC. I'm still hesitant to shell out this much coin for a device like this."
1,"Great concept, but...","Could they have made it any uglier? It has the same look as my old Compaq from 1997. And for the price of an iPhone, it should at least be in color and have a touch-screen. Maybe I've just been spoiled by Apple's usability & design, because for Kindle, there's just no 'WOW' factor at all."
2,where is the sound,I don't have one of these --- but when they get one that reads the book to you with the words.. then maybe I will spend 350.00 on something like that.. I can buy a lot of book or actually go to the library and read the books for free. ---
3,too expensive,"I haven't purchased a Kindle yet, but I would love to. My main reasoning is that the prices on the ebooks seem to be higher than the traditional formats sometimes. I would want a classic book (especially a public domain work) to be $.99 or $1.99 at the most. And a newer book needs to be under $5 in my mind."
1,Stupid product. Give it up Amazon!,What a stupid product! And it looks so cheap and plastic. Why would anyone buy this?? It's cheaper and better to buy a paperback. Get this off the Amazon front page already. Give it up already!
3,It will or it won't,It is good or it is bad. Buy it or don't. Overpriced? Not an mp3? PDF ok? Buttons in bad place?Not gonna change my daily life one way or the other. Jeez!!!Who wants Pizza?
1,"Stupid, dumb,Idea","What a stupid, dumb idea! Who cares about the Kindle revolutionize anything? At least when someone steals your book it cost 10 bucks to replace. What happens when they steal you kindle with all the book software inside? How can this black and white ugly thing replace full color magazines? Why is there a need for it? This is nothing but a rich stupid dumb toy with no real purpose. I am tired of looking at this in the middle of my Amazon screen every time I log on. I don't want it, and I don't care about it. I am a HI-Tech guy with HD DVD player. If you want to impress me offer a Kindle with a 1600 Native resolution LED Screen."
1,The product is junk,THis product does not allow you to put your own content on it.You can only buy it from amazon so they can mark up the price.Until you can download your own product on to the reader it is worthless.
5,A better way to read.,"I've had my kindle since Christmas, and love it. The folding cover does suck, the page turn buttons are awkward and easily hit on accident, and the keyboard would be better as a slide out. But on the whole, it is so easy and pleasant to buy and read books. And when your done, you don't have a book to sit on a shelf, or to try to resell or anything."
5,Amazing item.,"The three things I love the most about my Kindle is that it is NOT backlit (so easy on the eyes), the battery lasts a very long time, and that I never had to figure out how to hookup, download, transfer and/or whatever other nonsense that would be necessary without Whispernet. That I can stay in bed on a Sunday morning and ""go get a paper"", is something that will never cease to amaze and tickle me. That alone is worth the cost. I've seen complaints that it takes too long to turn pages. I hadn't noticed that, maybe because I automatically got into the pattern where I know at what point on the current page to press the next page bar so that I am comfortably at the bottom of the page when it turns. Literally 2 seconds or less. I'd rather it was black. However - I LOVE THIS ITEM!"
4,Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device,just what I wanted so I don't have to take so many heavy books with me when I take transit or travel
5,The wave of the future!!!,"I was blown away at how cool this is!!! Now I can read while lying in bed and not have to flip back and forth to get the light on the page that I am reading. I love the size which makes it easy to carry with me to work so that I can read while on breaks. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read...I just started Moby Dick, which I would have never brought with me to work... Who needs to carry that much extra weight around???"
4,Kindle Review,This is a great way to read books. A little difficult to download books to if you don't have a wireless signal.
5,Amazing Kindle,My Uncle was using his Kindle on cruise. After a quick tutorial I decided enough paper books for me. Going to buy the book- reading it- and then finding a bookshelf (which were already overloaded) was enough to convince me. It's easy to use- love the wireless feature. Just click and your new selection is in the Kindle. No fuss/ No muss.This Kindle is a must buy for yourself or as a holiday gift. Easy to use for us baby boomers who may or may not be too gifted when it comes to using the new technologies. Just wish every published book was available on Kindle. Soon enough I'm sure. If you're a reader - this is a sure thing to purchase.
3,Kindle Review,"The kindle is a great invention, but is lacking in certain design details. The next page button is in a bad place, I am always hitting it by mistake when adjusting my position or moving the kindle. The pages seem to be too short, not like in a book, therefore, one is always going to next page. There is no way to tell how many pages are in the book. There are little dots at the bottom of each page to see how far you have come, but no page numbers. When reading a book I sometimes like to go back to read something over, regarding a character, etc. In the kindle it is too difficult to do that. I also like to read the blurbs about the author, his or her other books. The kindle just has the book pages, nothing else."
4,Accessories,Great product but for $360 the reading light and D/C car charger should be included. Amazon knows everyone will need/want both items.
4,For me Kindle is a wonderful,"I'm a voracious reader sometimes 2 or 3 books a week. Kindle has freed me from toting heavy, cubersome hard copy books aound with me.THere are only a few minor things that bugged me at first but I quickly learned how to get what I wanted from my kindle.It was well worth the money."
1,Kindle - Lack of Coverage and Subscription Support,"If you are considering buying a Kindle you should be aware that Whispernet is not supported in all area. Whispernet is a Sprint service. If you do not have Sprint coverage in your area the Kindle's features prove to be limited and very inconvenient to use. Specifically, you need to download all content to your Kindle via a USB connection and subscriptions are not available.If you live in the states listed above you need to be aware that you will only be able to download books via USB to your Kindle. Amazon does not make this clear in their promotional materials. I wasted a lot of time discovering this through troubleshooting.Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device"
3,If it's stolen or lost Amazon has no way of disabling it for unauthorized use.,"Loved it. Customer service was ok, if somewhat dim witted. (""That's not my area of expertise."" i.e., That's not my job.)However, I left mine on a plane by accident (my fault), called to see if they could block the serial number from being reregistered to someone else. They can't. All I could do is deregister to keep them from using my account. Best Customer Service could do was tell me to file a police report and they would be happy to work with the police. WHAT?With all the technology and the enormous database that this company has at it's disposal you would think that there would be a way to report the device as stolen and block downloads. I'm writing a lengthy letter with recommendations to JB as well.I can stop someone from using my $100 cell phone but I can't stop someone from using my $400 ebook. What a world, what a world."
4,adding light for nite readers,"I am the owner of kindle 2. It is a great product. The only item that is missing ,is a light for night readers. The light will enable you to read without disturbing your spouse or partner's sleep.It is a must do. Please call me to update my unit when you have the new version with light installed.sincerelyHabib Anwar, M.D."
2,Disappointed,"My Kindle has been difficult to use. Although I downloaded the instructions, I would have appreciated a written book of instructions. Several books I wanted to order were unavailable in the Kindle store. Mosat serious is that my Kindle is now experiencing technical difficulties which are going to require the intervention of your technicuans. I was on the phone with Dave trying to resolve the problem via instruction but that did not work. I would like a new Kindle. I am displeased with a new product that is having the level of difficulty that my Kindle demonstrates. The current problem is that my Kindle is unable to establish a connection when I attempt to order from the Kindle store. Please stand behind your product and replace my present Kindle with one that is problem free. Thank you very much. Alison Strong"
3,"Decent, but hoping a second iteration of Kindle","I received the Kindle as a gift and was excited when I first got it. I travel quite a bit and was tired of lugging around books from place to place given that airlines are now making you pay for checked luggage. Anyway, it is easy to read, but I don't like the usability of the product. The buttons are too big and there is always a strange delay when either pressing a button or moving from page to page. You can't comfortably sit with it and hold on to it and just read. If you brush against the next page or previous page button it just goes. The buttons are too large and too many to turn the pages. I'm hoping for a second iteration for improvements like please go to IDEO or a Japanese or Italian product design firm for some better product design and user improvements."
2,Don't Drop It!,"I bought my husband the Kindle and he absolutely loved it. You could say he was addicted. He was thrilled to have it for the airplane trip we had planned. Then, within 3 weeks of owning the Kindle, he accidently dropped it on the carpeted floor. It quit working. Customer Service couldn't help and told us to return it to them. We did and all we got was a deeply discounted refund (Amazon kept over $100) and no more Kindle.We don't feel like we can afford to replace it since we didn't even get a full refund.So, but with care."
1,Artificially crippled,"I'm not a huge fan of the looks, but that's not stopping me from buying. I'd like more store options, but I'd still buy being tied only to the Amazon store via EDVO.Even the ultra-limited web browser wouldn't kill the deal for me.My deal breakers are the lack of PDF reader support (non-DRM would be fine with me), and lack of MobiPocket DRM support (which Amazon owns). Why limit reading my own content DRM (via MobiPocket) or whatever I'd like from my PC via PDF (without a costly conversion)?Amazon, you are so close, and yet artificially crippled your product for what seems no good reason. I hope this thing can get it's software upgraded via the EDVO connection, as you will undoubtably be shown the error of your ways by the unfooled consumers.Such a shame."
1,Amazon's kindle non repair service is HORRIBLE and UNACCEPTABLE,"Length:: 1:42 MinsI Love the Kindle. I am totally addicted. Wonder full the reading and fulfillment process. Couldn't be better.BUT! THE SERVICE & SUPPORT ARE HORRIBLE.My 2.5 yr son dropped the kindle in the airport. Stupid of me. The Kindle Screen is broken.Of course I should receive no warranty! BUT! Amazon.com does NOT REPAIR BROKEN KINDLE'S at all.Support they told me: BUY A NEW KINDLE.ARGUMENT: Did you not read the warranty info? We do not repair.Come on! I love amazon since 1996. I buy EVERYTHING from them. I love their first concept kindle design but THIS NON-SERVICE IS UNACCEPTABLE!If your kindle has a problem with the power supply plug they cannot repair it. Only problems with manufacturing are covered. If one of your key is broken, sorry! No repair.I do not think this is reasonable for a $355 device. Paid Repair should be an option.SHAPE UP AMAZON!"
3,Get it but order an extra adapter!,"I really like my kindle. Yea the buttons that turn the page are a little easy to push but i don't have to hold a heavy book and the print size can be changed easily. However, i haven't been able to use my kindle because the adapter broke. Without it your kindle is a paper weight. I would recommend that if you buy a kindle to go ahead and put your order in for a replacement adapter. It will not charge through your computer so this is its only source of life. Without an adapter you have a $350 peice of equipment that has a copy of your books, newspaper, and blog subscriptions that you've paid for but can't use."
2,Not for serious readers,"The thing does not permit taking handwritten notes on the page, either in the margins or in the text. That disqualifies it as a serious reading device and makes it useless for students. My copies of, say, Paradise Lost or the Republic are a sea of notes scribbled all over the page, and on every re-reading I add more. That habit, I have found, is shared by virtually every serious and engaged reader. Notes on separate pages (or another computer) are simply no alternative. Once I can scribble to my heart's content, and the thing reliably preserves my thoughts (and perhaps even allows later editing, which might be rather nice once earlier concerns are overcome and new questions arise upon continued study), I might take the device seriously. Without that capability, it's just another silly plaything."
3,Learn from Cell Phones!,"When they get this puppy down to $100 and great content availability -- I'll snatch one up in a heartbeat -- and I'll bet Amazon couldn't keep them in stock!Cell phone companies have learned that it is the content (for them -- the wireless service) that makes the $$$. Amazon has clearly made a significant stride forward in the ""reader device"" arena. Why not seal the deal by upping content availability and dropping the price! They could become totally dominate in this market with just a few strategy adjustments!"
2,No tech support,"I received the Kindle for a birthday present last May. I LOVE it and used it non-stop for 4 months. Then the unthinkable happened. I left it on the floor and my dog stepped on the screen and ruined it. When I called to see if it could be repaired, I was told there is no repair facility and that I was just out of luck. I was told to keep the Kindle in hopes that someday there would be a repair facility. So now it sits unused, gathering dust and I'm frustrated. I don't understand how a product is sold knowing there is no way to repair items broken through carelessness and/or stupidity!"
1,Fabulous,I love my kindle. This is a must have for the road warrior. No more tons of books to carry on long business or leisure travel. No more sitting in the airport for a delayed flight without a book that. A new one will be there in seconds.
1,Item never arrived,"Very disappointed due to the way amazon choose to ship. After 3 weeks from date of purchase item never arrived, due to the way amazon choose to ship using DHL to ABQ, postal service then it got lost in the postal system. DHL sent this package all over the continental US for 2 1/2 weeks before it ever arriving in NM. (Started in Denver and should have ended in Albuquerque, NM.) Then postal carrier never notified me when package finally arrived, When I did find it was here, the postal system couldn't locate where it was being kept. After speaking to a supervisor at the USPS I told them to send it back to amazon, Since I was tired of dealing with this nonsense and aggravation. Frankly I could have driven to Denver, Colorado and back to NM in 1/16th of the time it took to arrive. This has happened with other shipments bought thru amazon. I will not be using amazon to shop in the future."
4,Cautionary tale,"The product works as advertised - however - be warned. I left mine on a plane. While you can de-register it to guard against others downloading, amazon will NOT give you any kind of price break to replace it. The paperback size device is $400 down the drain if you lose it - AND - if you don't rebuy (I won't) at full price, your unread purchased books are dead too. This is the great risk of the device - and Amazon is very short sighted to not offer a replacement at a reduced price (<$200 would be the price point)."
3,Odd Choices,"While a wonderful concept, I find it odd cater technology to mainly urban areas. People living in rural areas without large libraries or bookstores would benefit more from this product. Why Amazon chose to not include wi-fi is somewhat stunning. Many rural areas do not have EVDO access, or even if they do, it isn't Sprint.Hopefully, Amazon will realize the blunder and add wi-fi to the next generation."
1,I want to buy it....but,"I want this device, but $400.00 seems a little high, given the lessons we learned form the ipod and iphone, in 30 days it will be 50% less and perhaps with more power. I think the price point was set too high, good luck getting the early ground swell. For a cutting edge org, someone missed the price point."
1,$400? Really???,Let's think about this...1. It's Ugly2. You can't resell a book when done3. You can't buy used books4. Poor contrast5. Buttons? Perhaps they didn't see the iPhone6. EXPENSIVE... It'll take you 400 books just to start saving money with it.7. Only slightly cool thing is the ability to download from anywhere without an internet connection.
4,Good but lacks features for students,"I would love to get my hands on one of these to replace my enormous stack of expensive college text books. However i am going to wait until they produce a new generation model that allows a reader to underline, highlight, and bookmark places in the book so they can become a study tool and not an untouchable text."
3,Internet Access,Let me surf the web on this device and you will have a killer app. Being able to surf the web with a device like this with that level of convenience is the future.
2,Should Sell for about 19.95,"I agree with the razor-blade argument. You have to pay 400 bucks and still buy the books? Huh? Should also come with a built-in MP3 player. And even then it should sell for about $39.95. ""The future of reading?"" Not yet."
4,enjoy the experience,"I have had my kindle since late decemeber. It is light weight and very handy. I have purchased a cover for the screen and a jacket. I have really enjoyed the ease of use and how simple it is to down load books. Books download in minutes, it really saves a trip to to the library or the store for the next novel. My major issues is that there is no back lighting, having a light on the unit would make it awesome. I also want to fully load this thing but the organization seems a little difficult. these are things that could be worked on to improve this product."
3,changes to kindle,"I have my kindle for one year. I love the convience of always being able to have a book to read. A few issues: While away on vacation I was unable to download books. I was unaware of a global kindle and can not understand why I can not change my sevice to include it. There are many books unavailable on the kindle. These are not new books and are very popular books. A few suggestions: A lighted sceen would be very helpfull for nighttime or airplane reading. A picture frame backing so I can stand the kindle up while sitting at a table, a remote to change the pages. It would be great to have a trade in when the newer kindles come."
3,Kindle shortcomings,"I read the many comments regarding the awkward 'next page' bar design, but ordered a Kindle anyway. At this point, however, I find it virtually impossible to hold the Kindle in a comfortable reading position without touching the 'previous' or 'next page' bars, as they encompass the entire left and right sides of the device - and wish I had waited for a fix to this serious design flaw. It is incomprehensible how the Kindle made it into full production without someone realizing the problem - and I look forward to the availability of some sort of retrofit case that protects the sides from inadvertent contact. Such a retrofit should be made available at no cost to all who purchased the Kindle."
3,"Kindle media bust, books hit","I purchased Kindle to replace the hard copy of my daily newspaper and cut down on paper waste. However the experience of reading the paper on Kindle has not been satisfying. I shall probably sign up for the paper's online version instead, where the text is unedited and the graphics are available. The books on Kindle promise to be a very good experience, however. My first book appeared on Kindle without delay and is there for me to read at my own pace with a choice of type size that obviates eye strain. I intend to build a library of Kindle books."
4,Kindle for Christmas,"I gave my husband the Kindle for Christmas, and he is very pleased with it. He likes scrolling through the book store and checking out different books and reading the reviews. He ordered one book and found that it was easy to read, especially after enlarging the type a little. The Kindle is also pretty user friendly.Even though over 200,000 books are downloadable, we are having trouble finding books that we like. Some of our favorite authors do not seem to be available. But all in all it was a hit as a gift!"
5,Much Better than Reviewers Claim,"I owned a prototype Sony eReader with electronic ink. It still had controls in Japanese with limited functionality. Then came the English version Sony eReader which became stable and usable but it gave access to obscure books that never interested me. Now, Amazon has taken a great ""quantum"" leap in reading techniques. Their wireless option, range of fonts, simplified downloading, and multi-function improvements make this device state-of-the-art with an implied certainty that Amazon will continue to support it and grow the library of available books and documents. Regrettably, many reviewers complain about the price. I wonder what they think is fair? Are you aware of the current prices of sophisticated technology? What about an Xbox, Nintendo DS? These are expensive toys while the Kindle has the potential for expanding our personal library and minds."
4,Kindle Review,"Would be better if buttons for ""Next Page"" and ""Previous Page"" were smaller. They are so long it is hard to find a way to comfortably hold the machine without accidentally changing the page.It would also be better if the ""On-Off"" switch were on the front instead of the back.A great concept, but I bet later editions will be better ergonomically."
5,How did I live without it?,"I was a little hesitant at first, because I love my books so much. What would I do without those items that have brought me so much pleasure in the past? But I was encouraged to give it a try. NOW, how did I live without it? It makes it so easy to carry my reading material(s) with me in my purse. I can skip from one book to another, from my Bible to my latest fiction in just a few seconds.I think these are the answer to all those school children loaded down with text books. This is the 'killer app' for the Kindle. School Textbooks!!"
3,More options for highlighting please!,"I love my kindle but the options for highlighting is so limited. Only one color!!! Please make more colors so that i can analyze my texts with further accuracy and go more in depth. More colors for more annotating please!!!!!!Other than that, the kindle is great. I can access it anywhere and so convenient to use. I love the way one can flip the pages like a real book."
4,Great device. Would like improvements to make it perfect:,Very nice device. Great for windy beaches.When reclining on lounger it is hard to hold and turn pages.Would really like to be able to turn pages with two identical scroll wheels on opposite sides of device and get rid of large buttons.nice site for classic books: feedbooks.com
4,kindle,"I really like the convenience of the kindle. Only downfall is that you cannot use it to download without ur computer when traveling abroad. Within the U.S. able to download so easily and spend $$$ so easily. I like the feature that you can get a sample before buying. It is fairly easy to navigate and figure out, but I wish there was an easy or simple start guide that is included in most electronic device. Also, I think there needs to be more books available. Some books I want say they are coming soon but that is all the info that is given. Overall, it is good for a first attempt and i enjoy the convenience of it. Maybe Amazon could get creative and design some more creative cover than a ""little black book"" look. If anyone has seen more creative covers, plz let me know. Thanks"
1,"Another soon to be out-dated book reader. sorry, but no thanks.","I played with one of these:Pros:For the content it does deliver, it does it well.Good screen, good battery life, good usability.Cons:No PDF support = worthless to IT, Science and Academic FieldsProprietary Format from Amazon = all of those files worthless in the futurePrice = I can almost buy a UMPC for this much money (micro pc)Considering that amazon knows book buyers, I would say, shame on amazon for not delivering a truly useful product."
1,Lack of serious documentation.,"Two pages into the opening program, it turns off. Restarting the program seems impossible. Even the reset button does not work to restore the opening message. Documentation, like step by step opening or extensive trouble shooting is non existent. I have not called tech support yet, that will happen in 40 hours. It is hard to pick up the device without turning the pages forward or backward. You turn it off by extracting it from the book cover and locating the button on the back. Wireless hookup does not work where cell phones do not work. Otherwise is implied in the advertising. The book cover does not hold the book! Only the elastic holds the book in the cover when not in use. During use, there is a %50 probability that the mechanism will fall out of the cover.Its a great idea, but poorly appointed and lacks adequate operating instructions. Next I make the phone calls. Already I feel gypped."
3,Kindle,"In case anyone cares to know who the OEM and front for Kindle are then listen (look closely, read closely...er... whatever) closely. Thanks to tipster John H. for doing a bit of snooping on the FCC because he's uncovered a few secrets about Amazon's e-book. The front is Payne LLC. based out of Delaware who requested a confidentiality agreement on October 31. The test reports reveal that the Kindle is manufactured by Hon Hai Precision Ind. Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and was tested on July 8. The report talks about EVDO and SAR (specific absorption rate), which has nothing to do with tampons, so there it is. Mystery solved."
1,No PDF? What's the point?,"I go through 200-300 pages of PDFs a week, and for now either have to print them out or read them on my laptop. I've been contemplating buying a tablet PC, but because of the price thought I'd hold off until this little gizmo came out. Great - light, easy to read, good battery life with the wireless off. Oh, but no PDF support. What were they thinking? So it'll be the Sony Reader Sony PRS500 Portable Reader Systemfor me. True, it supports fewer titles, but for me at least that is not the main objective. The Sony Reader is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and gives me the flexibility to upload onto it anything I want. No wireless? No problem. That's what my blackberry and laptop are for. I need a reader - I'll let my Blackberry do the rest."
5,Happy with my Kindle,"I'm 92 years old, still working and reading at least one book a week, not to mention newspapers, newsletters and business and engineering magazines. My Kindle has become a right arm. I enjoy browsing through books, taking samples and especially being able to adjust the print size on the screen. I can highly recommend it to anyone of any age. It brings back the ability to read for me at leisure time. In closing, I can't say anymore than ""Good Work Kindle."" Bravo!Mort Silberman"
5,Kindle is an unbelievable and wonderful way to read a book!,Kindle makes it possible to have a book at your fingertips at all times. I love to be able to make notes as I read and to be able to look up unfamilar words. I have showed off the Kindle every chance I get. I always have to take a suitcase of books when I travel. Now I can take the Kindle in my carry-on or in my pocketbook. It's a great invention!
1,Too Fragile to be Practical,"I bought a Kindle 3 months ago and have enjoyed it for all the reasons others have until yesterday. I pulled my Kindle out of my purse (which was on the floor)and as I was doing so it slipped from my fingers and fell to the carpeted floor (about 6-8 inches). I had seen the drop test video and thought nothing of it, except now my Kindle doesn't work. The toggle that allows you to view the menu, etc no longer depresses. I called customer service. The device cannot be repaired. The warranty does not apply, but I could replace the Kindle for $180. I have uploaded several books, 6 of which I have not yet read, and will not be able to. I will not be replacing the device. Customer service is nonexistent. The device is simply too fragile to be practical."
4,Technology Getting Better,"Hi there - I've owned aSony Readerand much prefer the Kindle. Kindle's interface, keypad, navigation and pageturn speed make it superior in my mind.That said, the pageturn speed still needs to be significantly improved and the book selection needs to be dramatically increased."
4,Love my Kindle,"I've had my Kindle now for about six weeks; I actually love my kindle. I truly enjoy receiving my new york times each morning. The only downside is the fact that if you touch it in the wrong way, the pages turn. This should have been better designed. Turning the Kindle off is a challenge without moving the pages backward or forward. This problem needs to be resolved. Also, it's much easier to search or purchase books on line rather than through the Kindle. Those are my only critcisms."
5,Simply Amazing,"I've had my kindle for about a week and love it. The Kindle is such a great device for readers - small, slim and easy to carry. With the Kindle, you can always have your book, magazines, and newspapers with you. The ""paper"" screen really is like reading a book. I am not a fan of reading on a computer screen. The Kindle screen is completely different as the product description and more detailed reviews discuss. I am especially looking forward to using the Kindle when I travel from California to China."
5,Kindle worth the money,I like to read novels and this product is perfect. I purchased the Kindle before having hip replacement surgery. It has really kept me occupied. Reading can be done using one hand so being in bed is not a chore. Kindle would NOT be good for my other reading habits; gardening books and digital photography books. I am glad I made the purchase. A nurse and a hospital tech asked me about the Kindle. The nurse was sold on it when I showed her how to change text size...Her parents will be getting a Kindle for Christmas!
4,A few beefs,"Now that I've had my kindle for awhile, I have a couple of problems. First, I wish I had known that there were a few of my favorite authors that apparently don't want to let there books be sold on Kindle, namely, John Grisham. Second, what happened to nothing over $9.99? The last two books I wanted to buy were $14 +. I read faster now, and that means buying more books...I still love the reader, but I am disappointed a little :{ If I am wrong about this (someone at Amazon?), please let me know. Thanks."
2,bound for failure as it stands,"While I enjoy the idea of this product, it either needs to be half as expensive or come bundled with 20 free book downloads. Why spend $400 on a closed function device whose sole purpose is to inspire you to spend more money on manufacturer controlled content?Will there be a ""coffee table Kindle""?"
2,Ergonomically Horrible,"The Kindle does not handle well. The position of the left and right turning buttons are ill-positioned. Everytime I went to pick it up, I turned the page inadvertently. I also found it to be slightly bulky; maybe because the turning button takes up the entire left side of the Kindle. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.Sony's Digital reader is not only more affordable ($299) but is designed a lot better. The only good thing I can say about the Kindle is that the screen and e-ink are crystal clear. My recommendation is to wait until Amazon develops a better version of the Kindle."
3,Wish it had a back light,"My friend just bought one and I love it. I have not ordered my own because I use a pda with a backlight to read in the dark. I would buy this tomorrow if I could read in the dark. I am sad I cannot find a use for one at this price if my main function is to read in the dark when the lights are out.Amazon, please consider a back light."
2,No direct document import???,"I've been playing with a borrowed Kindle and like what I've seen, with one major exception. The look and physical design of the product is very good, Whispernet is a great idea and the ebooks are priced fairly. That said, I will NOT be be buying the product because it does not allow you to directly upload documents from your computer. Reading paperwork (PDFs and Word docs) on my e-reader would be the NUMBER ONE reason (and justification) for me buying one. Until they sort this issue out (and don't make us pay to read our own files!!), I will not be buying the product.The Sony Reader at least takes a stab at trying to handle user created documents. No wonder all the big publishing houses have gone the Sony route for reading submissions and internal docs..."
4,Pleasant reading,"I have owned my Kindle for a month and have enjoyed several books and a daily newspaper subscription. The size, weight and screen are all comfortable to handle over any period of time. I read my Kindle like a book for hours and do not experience eye fatique. My only criticism is it is too easy to hit the next page key by mistake. When you are reading the operation keys are in the correct locations, but moving the device when it is on creates some issues. Knowing this, I have learned to handle the Kindle around the edges. Otherwise, I love my Kindle."
4,Amazon Kindle,"I love my new Kindle. I'm still in the process of learning it's features and how to best operate it, but so far it is everything I had hoped. I have bought several books, and tried a sample of my local newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, but found I don't enjoy newspaper reading on the Kindle. But it's ability to hold multiple books is more than worth this purchase.My only other criticism is that it is not backlit. That would be a wonderful improvement if you would do this. I did purchase the Mighty Bright Light that clips on, but this is a bit cumbersome, and when traveling a backlit Kindle would be preferable."
4,Kindle,"Love the Kindle, but why does it not have a back light.....the mighty lite is okay but with all the details and thought put into this product, I would have love for it to have a back lite."
5,Can I rate it over 5 stars?,"I've had mine since Chritmas Eve (a gift from my wonderful wife - I even tried to lobby her to let me open it before 12/24, since she had it 12/4 - no luck!If you are an avid reader as I am, I'll make it very simple - BUY IT. I've followed the product in it's developmental stages through Endgadget as well as viewing all reviews since 11/19 when it came out. I could comment about the buttons or the cover, but these comments are trivial at best. It does what it's was designed for better than anything else! The Sony reader, which I also own, doesn't even come close.As a commuter with a 2 hour trip each way, this is the only electronic device that makes my trip bearable.Thanks Amazon - Cant'wait to see 2.0."
5,Get it or die!,"All the good stuff has been said and it is all true. Ignore the naysayers and just do it - they don't know what they're talking about. In my case, 50 years of reading, collecting some 400 volumes of history and now it is has all been made so simple. It is like dying and going to library heaven.Thank you Amazon for an amazing product. You rock!"
4,Kindle Fun,"I bought this for myself as a birthday present, then discovered that my Family chipped in to buy it as a Christmas gift. They thought it would be perfect for an avid reader like myself. They were right!!! The only thing that would make it perfect would be if it were in color. I'm still learning, but so far, it's terrific."
4,Love My Kindle!!!,"So convenient and easy to use. I absolutely love my kindle. At first I was a bit reluctant to order it because I thought it would be yet another device that would be difficult to understand and operate. Lucky for me I was wrong! The Kindle is so easy, convenient and absolutely great to use. Download takes a few short minutes. Browsing for new books is fantastic!The only thing I would change about the Kindle is that it is hard to hold it comfortably without accidentally pressing the turn-page button. It takes getting used to! I do love it!!!"
3,Kindle Review,"The Kindle is a most capable ebook reader. It efficiently delivers ebooks via the built-in network hi-speed connection so anywhere you have Sprint service you can shop and download ebooks from Amazon.The single biggest problem I have with the device is the extremely poor human factors design. You can barely hold it without touching one of the Next or Previous page buttons as they take up both sides of the Kindle. Also, the wireless switch for the battery draining cellular modem is on the back, necessitating removing the device from it's cover in order to toggle it on and off.Overall, I enjoy the product, though I wish Amazon would've tested it with users before releasing it. I can't imagine they did."
4,Great for those who read a lot of books and don't like them piling up.,"I have had this kindle since December, so I have had a few months to ""break it in"".I go through a lot of books so it is great that they are all present on my kindle without me having to hunt for them elsewhere. I used to use Adobe Acrobat reader, and Microsoft reader but if you ever have to reformat your hard-drive or if you change computers I always ended loosing some books. With this it is right there in one spot, and you can re-download things to your device.Here is my big HUGE problem, I like to skim books then go through them again. I also like to read anthologies, more then one story in one ""book"". You cannot skip to the story in the middle, you have to flip page by page, or you have to guess and use this menu on the bottom that does not correlate with the page number (it is 1-0 so it does not tell you if pushing 4 will take you to page 57 or 89). If you like flipping back and forth between pages this gets very annoying."
2,Amost a good product,"THE GOOD NEWS: The concept is great. Before Kindle, I abandoned more than half of the books I purchased after reading a chapter. Kindle's ""Try before you buy"" is saving me a few bucks.THE BAD NEWS: Kindle's human factors department should be banished. Reading in bed is so difficlut as to make me abandon the practice; Kindle falls our of its cover and page-turning ""buttons"" are badly placed, too large, and inadvertently pressed.Amazon is sold out now. I hope that the new production models will be improved.Revolutionary idea: Bring in a some readers who actually use the product and get their comments on any proposed new design."
1,"If it's not open to other formats, its not for me!","The price is a bit high but would be OK if the device accepted other formats. There are many classic eBooks out there for $2.00 plus libraries have regular eBooks for free. I've waited a long time for the right device, I can wait a little longer."
1,Kindle Not So Great,"I bought this gift for my daughter's 17th birthday. The Kindle device had problems with getting a strong signal and was very slow every time I tried to navigate between different screens. Most times, the Kindle device would freeze and lock up. I was able to download books successfully from my Amazon account. The Kindle advertisements bragged about download in less than 1 minute, but actually took closer to 10 minutes. I also attempted to download some books for a 5-year old, but found a traditional book with color and pictures to be much more stimulating for a young child. Also, the selection of books for a 5-year old are not very good. My Kindle is now dead, less than 2 weeks after my daughter opened this for her birthday. I plan to return it for a refund."
4,Ideal device,"Kindle is the ultimate book to carry along. Easy to use. Ordering new material is easy and exciting. So very light and convenient to read while waiting anywhere, anytime. It made a great Christmas present for my spouse and he is so happy with his new ""toy"". Just wish the list of books and magazines was more extensive. Want USA Today. Also, everyone who sees Kindle wants to own one. Very inovative. Just love it!"
5,Amazing!!,I love this reader. This is technology at its best! It is so easy and the downloads are fast and inexpensive. Way to go!!
4,Convenient,"I love the kindle, it is so easy to use. If there was one negative it would be that the buttons on the sides are to far down and it sometimes is difficult to hold without pushing a button accidentally. That is my only complaint. I love the ease of ordering and it has already come in handy for me."
5,GREAT,"Amazing ... have the power, knowledge, entertainment and relaxation of several books in the palm of your hands. I only wish this item could be used anywhere in the world ... at this time you can only download books in the USA. Looking forward to using it around the world!"
4,JUST WISH IT WAS INTERNATIONALLY COMPATIBLE!,"I love the videos, seeing the reviews from other past customers and also the very tempting prices. I would love to see this product come here to Australia as I would immediately buy one.I also think that maybe a touchscreen/touch pad would be better alongside the scroll wheel? Most people these days do carry their PCs with them, so how about desktop software that manages all your electronic books? Maybe a simple web browser might be nice?"
1,Beware-some of your favorites may not be available,"I love books so my husband gave me a Kindle as a gift. I thought it would be handy for traveling and that I would be able to carry lots of books with me in a small space. Truth is I love the feel of a real book so could never see a Kindle taking the place of books altogether. I have however been disappointed in the books available in Kindle format. I like to read in Spanish and have thus far not been able to find anything written in Spanish. I looked up some of my favorite authors: Marquez, Allende, Mastretta. Nothing in Spanish OR English. That strikes me as peculiar that Marquez, a Pulitzer prize winner, is not available. I have concluded that the Kindle is not well suited for the kind of reader that I am. If you are a buyer prospect, take a look first in the Kindle store to see if their selection suits your interests."
1,This product is not ready for market,Waited 5 days to receive my Kindle and it did not work out of the box. The only thing I could read was the instruction manual. It could not connect to the wisper network. When I called customer service they told me that it would take 3 days to get an answer as to what the problem was. This product obiviously still has some design flaws ans is not ready to goto market. For $359.00 I would expect a product that works and customer service that can actually do something. I am very dissapointed with this product and have returned it to Amazon.
2,Occasionally ok,I have had the Kindle Reader for 4 days now and it is easy to use and easy to read. However there are faults which are immediately apparent.1. The cover falls off repeatedly.2. The back cover falls off repeatedly.3. There are so many buttons on the front that it is nearly impossible to hold without accidentally pushing a button and turning your page and losing your place.4. I looked for 40 books today that I wanted to read. I did not find a Kindle Edition of a single one.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I almost never read novels, etc. The Kindle seems desgned for such books only. Graphical charts, ets, are very poorly displayed, even after experimenting with print size.Also very few recent books are available in Kindle format, especialy if they have a conservative point of view. And the newspapers, magazines, etc are almost always far left!I have almost stopped using the device. I do expect it will someday be useful, but it isn't now.RHSc"
4,Present for my wife,Got it as a gift. After a few days of getting used to it she's had no complaints.
5,GG's word,"I enjoy it most because it is easy to transport, read and download additional books, newspapers, magazines, etc. When flying, vacationing or just lounging it is very convenient. I've probably saved quite a few dollars on book purchases as opposed to the 14.95 to 26 dollars I normally spend on novels. I look forward to acquiring a sizable library on my Kindle. My husband and I travel quite abit on vacation, we're retired AF, and the Kindle saves a lot of weight in our luggage that translates to money saved. Thanks to Oprah, I received a good discount on my purchase, as well."
4,If only it had a backlight...,"I would have given it 5 stars although it reads well even in low light. For those of us who already have to use reading glasses however, it would be much easier to read with a backlight.Other than that, I love this device. I was already a big reader and I travel quite a bit, however I detested lugging around all those books. This is the solution plus some. With the availability of magazines and newspapers delivered right to the device, I just love it. Also very easy to use; you can figure it all out without reading the directions."
5,Kindle is amazing,I have had the Kindle since February and I love it. I am never without it. I read on the train where many people stop me and ask what that is. I then precede to tell them and show them.I am an avid reader and enjoy that Best sellers are available and also that some writers are writing exclusively for Kindle.
4,Kindle is awesome,"How convenient, so many books so little time except with the Kindle you can carry all your books with you at once. Just wish it was backlit for long rides in the car at night.."
4,Kindle,"I like having all my reading material on one device. I can switch from reading reader's digest to my favorite story by one click.One suggestion for improvements would be to slightly change the angle of the next bar on the right. When trying to hold the kindle in the case, I hit the next page bar by accident.Overall, if you're an avid reader, this is the device for you. I find I'm reading more often now.Thanks Amazon and Oprah"
2,Kindle,"Nice idea, but not really what I wanted. But your return policy is great! No problems with the return, making it this easy, I will always consider my purchases with Amazon.com."
1,Limited 3G access,"Having thought my Kindle 3G was better than sliced bread, I must now revise my opinion. When I bought it in December 2011, I was promised unlimited 3G access. This was the main reason I bought it. On using it in the Canaries this November, I found that I had been cut off after a week. When I complained to Kindle they said that from July 2012 they had limited access to 50 mb per month. I had had no notice of this and do not agree that they are entitled to do it unilaterally."
4,my new constant companion,I love my kindle and take it with me everywhere I go. Renewed interest in reading!!!
5,Well worth the wait,"I waited about 5 weeks for my Kindle and am extremely happy with it. I'm reading more than I have in a long time. I carry this with me to work, on the bus, just about anyplace that I can get in a few minutes of reading.I know some people have had an issue with the page buttons on the sides, but it really doesn't take any time to get used to holding it so you don't accidently turn the pages and even if you do, it takes less than a heartbeat to get back where you were.I also haven't had any trouble with the cover. It doesn't seem to be that hard to set the Kindle in place and it's quite easy to flip the cover to the back and secure it with the elastic strap. It's not difficult to slip my finger behind the Kindle while it's in the case to turn it on or off.I love having a whole library with me in one tiny package. It's also easy to shop for books at Amazon.Over all, this is a really great product."
5,Fantastic,After a bit of a wait I finally got my Kindle. I am delighted. Download was lightening speed and the book selection is great. I was so excited I didn't even realize you can load audio books and music.I've had no problem operating it and enjoy the enlarged type. It is very easy on the eyes.Best thing is several books I ordered were a third of the price of an actual book. My library shelves are full and now I don't have to worry about how to sort out the popular fiction I don't keep and can carry numerous subjects around with me.As far as I'm concern this is the best thing since the wheel.
4,only one reason for 4 instead of 5 stars,"The only reason this product rated 4 of 5 stars for me is the very obvious design flaws that have been mentioned ad nauseaum:The page forward and back buttons interfering with the handling of the device and the inconvenience of the on/off and wireless buttons on the back requiring removal from the case to access, often causing the back to fall off.Other than that...the device is incredible and the SERVICE is the best! I finished a book and ordered another on the subway yesterday....never interrupted my reading on the hour long commute, when I would otherwise be staring at the walls.I've read more after purchasing the kindle than I have in years!Hopefully the next generation Kindle will enhance the ergonomics and make this a killer product!"
4,My review of the Kindle,"The Kindle I bought in July was a gift for my son.I bought a Kindle for me after seeing Jeff Bezos talking about it on the Charlie Rose show. I ordered one right away and love it. However, I wish one could fine tune it a bit. I have an eye condition called Macular Degeneration. It would really help if I could make more of a contrast between the background and the text. Also it would help if I could make the text larger. I already have it on the largest size. I am currently reading a book that has larger print in the first sentence of each chapter, so I know it is possible.Sometimes I am surprised at the unavailability of a book. So far I haven't been able to access ""Fearless Fourteen"". I know you carry the author's other books, so why not this one?I think it is great that one can read a sample before buying. Also, like the Save for Later, and the ability to look up a word in the dictionary. Most of all, the instant gratification of downloading a book so swiftly.Maxine Owen"
4,love it,Great device On the whole. A little unhappy with the inability to blow up the size of maps and switch easily to index.
5,"OMG, I love my Kindle!","Just for the record, it was my favorite thing before it was Oprah's! :) I was one that wondered if I would miss the feel of holding a book and whether a screen could deliver the same experience....Im a believer! :) The only problem is I can never finish reading, cause everyone keeps asking me to tell them about it and about how it works...Make the leap! You will be glad you did!"
5,Simply Amazing!!!,"I am an avid reader, and this product is created for that person in mind. It is a simple device that allows you to read, sample and search for books, magazines and newspapers with the touch of the button. I recently traveled to Hawaii for vacation, and it saved me so much hassel in packing books for our trip! I had several people come up to me and check it out, and it was really easy to show them how to use it! Others suggested books while sitting by the pool, and I was able to select a sample right there! I am on my 4th book on my Kindle, and love it! I am still learning about it, but think for people wanting to take their books with them, and get things instantly and for a more discounted price, then this is the product for them!"
4,Love Love Love It,"The Kindle is even better than I had hoped, although it is a bit pricey.I purchased one for my dad for Christmas. He is going to love the ""look up"" feature.My one complaint would be battery life.Great job, Amazon!"
3,"problem for citations,","Because of a problem I've experienced, not yet resolved or paid attention to by Amazon, I've cut my use of the device.My problem relates to its use for one purpose -- citations to text other than by ""location."" What I've pointed out to Amazon, by phone, is that when contemplating an ebook purchase I'd like to know whether the ebook will show page #'s for text or my notes.This is important for me because I use citations when writing. I cannot assume that those who read what I write will have an ebook to check my cite or will be near libary with a hard copy or an ability to call up an interlibrary loan.I understand that book publishers chose whether they will provide an ebook that will call up page numbers as well as locations, e.g., with David Brooks' new the Human Animal and I know the publisher's decision isn't something I, as an individual, can change.However, I do believe that Amazon should find a way to indicate what I seek when I call up a book from the ""store."""
1,Power adapter wire falling apart,"Like many others my power cable wiring starting chipping away and falling apart, leaving bare wires. And Amazon has the audacity to charge $20 replace them. This is a serious liability issue since the wire protective coating falls off leaving bare wires."
4,Considering the Kindle ?,"I read a lot and thought that the Kindle might be a good product for me I have just completed my first back. What I like about the Kindle is: readability options in terms of being able to enlarge the font, ease of use and navigation. The feel is good in the hand, it is easy to order books, and the prices are excellent. My only concerns are that the controls for page turning are somewhat awkward and you have to be careful where you put your fingers when holding the unit as a result. I think this device can be useful to avid readers. Neat tech tool!"
3,inavilibility of reading material,"The Kindle its self is great. The format is great, easy to use, user friendly, and convienant. My problem is with the reading material availability. I am involved in a couple of book series and some titles are missing from the middle of the series. To me this does not make sense, and causes a great inconvienance to the user."
3,no wireless in Canada,"Love the Kindle, but no wireless in Canada, so I have to download to my computer then to the Kindle, a very complex procedure. The buttons to turn a page are a bit too sensitve"
5,It is easy to use and light weight.,"It downloads new material, books, newspapers, magazines, blogs,etc. nearly instantly. The search function reviews all the books on the device plus the web. I also love the form factor: no more trying to fold the newspaper with one hand or hold a heavy hardback book."
4,I love it.,"I love to come to Amazon to look for stuff. It has everything. When I see kindle, I have doubt, but after the video clips, I love it. I have the good wireless, the EVDO, just as promised. All my books were available pretty much as soon as I turned it on. Also the pictures are fast and better than I had expected."
4,WSJ on Kindle,I receive the Wall Street Jounal on my Kindle every morning--a great advantage over waiting for home delivery or the mail. But why does my version of the journal include a section on New York City. I'm from the midwest--I could care less about what happens in NYC. Is there anyway to have a midwest news section versus the one I see now.
4,Page Key Placement,"Great product that I love to use. The only negative thing that I have found is the location of the page up/down keys on either side of the unit. I find that more then occasionally, I am flipping pages because the unit slipped in my hand, or my hand hit one of the keys while adjusting my hand position to read text that I covered with my finger, so that I wouldn't hit a page key while reading. Don't know that anything can be done to future iterations of the Kindle to correct this annoying problem, but I wish your HF engineers would give it a try.Thank you"
3,Where are all the magazines for women?,"I bought the Kindle to travel with hoping to down loads some good magazines.Most of them are all news related or things I am not interested in.The only possible I would consider would be the ""Shape "" magazine.What about Oprah, Good housekeeping, cooking, fashion, decorating magazines.Where are these kind of magazines?It seems like the Kindle caters to men only in the magazine area.Also I think the Books are expensive to purchase.When you purchase a hard cover you can at least share it with your friends.I am not sure if I made a good investment here.Think about all this before you purchase this."
4,Love My New Kindle!,"I just finished reading my first Kindle book - Nineteen Minutes by Jodie Picoult - what a phenomenal experience! I just kept tucking the Kindle in my purse and pulling it out to read whenever I had a spare moment. I wasn't sure how I would feel without the actual book in my hands, but this was awesome! I kept the wireless off, and the battery lasted over a week. The only drawback I can see is lack of light. It would be great if there was a built in light for night reading. A clip-on light on a Kindle seems like a bit of an oxymoron to me."
4,Wonderful where it works.,Somehow I thought that when a book was downloaded into my Kindle it was in my Kindle. Not so. I down-loaded my novel and then brought my Kindle along with me to my farm where my cell phone does not very often get reception and low and behold my novel was not there in fact there was a message that my Kindle was not able to get reception. So even tho it's nice to use when I'm in the city it does me no good when I'm at my farm which is about 50% of the time. If I had the hardcover book I could be carrying it back and forth with me. I'm not sure but I think there's a way to download it onto my computer for a charge so that may be something to think about. I just jumped into the purchase without much thought of my traveling back and forth.
3,Kindle,I like the Kindle. It's easy to use and the downloading of books from Amazon is seamless. My only complaint is that the buttons to turn the pages are too sensitive and it's sometimes difficult to do other things with the device without activating them.
2,Beware of lack of service in your area,"I love my Kindle but I have to leave my house and drive 10 minutes up the road to get it to work. After I bought it I found out there are dead zones all over America. I am not exactly in the boonies. I live on the Eastern shore of Maryland on the water. The problem is Verizon has my area locked in. So check your cell providers before you buy a Kindle. I think Kindle likes Sprint in order to work. Anyway, you can check maps on the Internet or call Kindle Support. They know exactly where the dead zones are.I think this technology is great and it will improve. $399 is a lot of money when you can't use an item as it was intended in your home home. 4 stars if I had service!"
2,Underwhelmed,"As many previous reviews have noted, the button placement is poorly thought out. Screen resolution is so-so, and this limits fumctionality when reading magazines or newspapers. After almost a month, I still find the machine ""in the way"" of the material I am reading. For me, the arrangement, size and feel of the Kindle are distracting. For the price, I am quite disappointed."
4,Kindle is pretty cool!,I really like my new Kindle because it is lightweight and easy to use. I have had nothing but good experience with Amazon as far as any issues I have encountered. I do wish pictures were clearer and in color and the buttons were either smaller or in different places. It is impossible not to hit the turn page button while reading by mistake occasionally. The downloads are superfast and great and the type is easy to read. I love my Kindle!
4,Even better than I expected!,"An avid reader, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to make the switch to an e-reader. But it was easy! It took me a few hours to keep from switching the page by accident, but once I learned my personal best way of holding after trying several recommendations from the forum, I'm now completely sold. I had 2 sacks of paperbacks and a few hardbacks that I hadn't read yet, so forced myself to switch back to paper and there basically was no difference....except that the Kindle is so light that I tend to read longer than I do with the paper books. In short, I love it and will never look back! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I do have trouble at times connecting to Whispernet even though I have all the bars, and I have the Kindle freeze up on occasion and have to reset. So I always keep a couple of extra unread books on my Kindle and I have a paperclip in the cover. Still I think it is well worth the investment!"
5,Love books,"I love books - I love to smell them - I love the way the feel in my hands and I love shopping for them. My problem was arthritis in my hands and especially thumbs making it harder and harder for me to hold a book for very long without extreme hand discomfort. When I first saw the Kindle being introduced as a Christmas item last year, I thought this might be my answer never guessing how much I would love it. It is the greatest. Even if I didn't have bad hands I would still use it."
4,"Great Product, Missing Key Features","This is a fantastic product. I love the reading experience, buying books, the internet connection. It's missing PDF support, almost unforgivable. Needs more subscriptions, hopefully these will come soon. I'd like to see PC Magazine, CODE Magazine and a few others."
5,love new Kindle!,"Fabulous new product! I received mine for BD, and have hardly put it down. Easy to learn, convenient to hold and use! I love to read --in bed, at breakfast, any time, and the ease of download, perfect size, clarity of type make it more fun than ever! Only thing -- I don't believe I should use it in the tub! Could you make one that floats??I love it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a lot, loves to find new books, and is running out of bookshelf space!"
4,"Love the convenience... but I keep hitting the ""next page"" buttons",That's my only real complaint. I find it not entirely comfortable to hold and keep hitting the next page / back page buttons on the side. (hard to imagine this wasn't an issue during beta testing!)
5,My Kindel,I had to wait 1 month for my Kindel to arrive. I have to say I am very impressed with this little device. I encourage readers to purchase one.The Kindel can become your own personal book I think that is awsome. I am still new at it but as you read on in the manual you learn new things everytime. Downloading is a snap. I feel the key board letters are a little small? The screen is very easy to see on your eyes. I do think that Amazon needs to add more books for the Kindel A.S.A.P.For old titles and new titles. I am a very happy customer.
3,"Decent Hardware, Terrible Searching",Pros:Books on the flyAll books in one deviceSaves paperDownloads are fastAccessible most anywhereGood Battery life when wireless is offCons:Terrible searchingNo way to find books by seriesThe buttons are too large and are easily hitHolding the book is awkwardNo way to share books between readers. When books are downloaded the kindle serial number is embedded in the book file in binary form.Slow
5,I love my Kindle,"I came across the Kindle by accident the first time and thought, ""What a cool device!"" So I started to research, and found the Sony and the Cybook; and they were both excellent. But they didn't have the wireless...so I gave in to the Kindle. And I am glad! I can download free books from the internet, as well as buying things from the Kindle store. I think I'm going to have a huge library in my purse! Ha!"
4,Overall loving it!,"I've had the kindle for a few weeks and although there are a few kinks, overall I'm loving it. I've downloaded half a dozen books, the NY Times, and a few blogs. Every morning I wake up to the Times on my kindle and between that and the books I've always got something to read. I'm happy with it and am having a great time. I've enjoyed the search function and the book previews the most. My biggest complaint is that the blogs don't update throughout the day like I thought they would. I was hoping to get updated info during the Iowa Caucus but alas nothing new came through while I was looking for info."
5,Just buy it...,"I know, you've be checking out kindle for months now. Just every so often. Wondering if it's really all that. Capitulate now. It is. Just take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it."
4,The Future of Publishing,"The Kindle is absolutely the future of newspaper, magazine and book publishing. To be able to (almost) instantly download newspapers from around the country and the world, the latest magazines, and in just minutes, a full size book, is truly an amazing power to hold in your hands.One of the great features of the kindle is the ability to sample (at no charge) the first three chapters of a book. With many books, that's quite enough! I also love the ability to change the font size to relieve tired old eyes.The Kindle is beautifully designed and easy to navigate through. When I first opened it, I thought it was too small -- smaller than I'd expected, but after using it, I love the size -- completely portable and unobtrusive.Someday (soon) every student in America from middle school through college will be carrying a Kindle containing all their course materials, textbooks, reference materials, and personal reading, and the backpacks will be a distant memory.GF"
1,"$2,397 (plus tax)","I'm not so good at the maths, but if it's $399 for the device and $9.99 per title, it appears that the Swindle would cost me over $2,000 to fill 'er up. Why on earth would I want to do that? Especially since the iPhone/Android has pretty much sealed the deal on getting my newspapers/blogs on the fly. You're going to have to do a lot better than this, Amazon. If I'm going to spend money on books, they'd better be making my bookshelves prettier."
1,Dead in the water,"I ordered my Kindle on 11/29, I received it on 1/7/08 and the device didn't work. It would not take a charge so I can't really comment on the features.. I called Amazon and they are shipping me a new one sometime in February. This has been very frustrating and I'm wondering if the rush to get these products out has hurt quality control..."
1,Waste of money,A book is much easier to keep up with and a lot cheaper. Not sure what all of the hype is over the Kindle as I think it is very over-rated.
3,BATTERIES,"Kindle sounded neat, UNTIL, the cost was TOO high. AND, after a person gets to the favorite plot, the battery stops running. Thanks, but no thanks !"
3,One charge is NOT enough for War and Peace!,"It took me FIVE WEEKS to read War and Peace (2007 translation), averaging about 240 pages a week. Maybe you should revise your advertising, since I don't think the Kindle batteries last long enough to get through that particular book on one charge."
4,"a great idea, but could use some work.","i absolutely love the idea of this product, but there are a couple complaints i have. first, the ""next page"" button on the right is incredibly inconvenient and i find myself accidentally skipping ahead pages simply because my hand naturally lays where amazon has decided to place the button. argh. aside from that, the only other major complaint i have is the cost of the books sold for the kindle- why am i paying $9.99 for a book i can buy in hard copy for $1-$2 more in the stores?? i can only imagine how many more people would buy this product if they were able to justify the cost of buying an electronic copy over a hard copy of a favorite book at a considerably discounted price. right now, that's not the case. $5 is a MUCH more reasonable price to pay."
1,Annoying ad,Tired of seeing it everywhere on Amazon...sooo annoying... plus it is black and white!!! who cares?!!!
1,Give it for FREE since you will force us to purchase from your store!,"Amazon has dropped the ball on this product. 1. once you purchase the books it should be under your ownership for life. DRM is a big mistake and will force more people to find ways to copy. If I lose my books, I'm not going to pay again and will find a way to obtain it free. 2. The device is overpriced, Amazon can make more if they lower the cost of the device since people will start to buy only from them. 3. Give it FREE if we purchase X amount of books per month. If not I have no plans to purchase this and will wait for Apple to come up with a better idea via iTunes."
1,Sony PRS-505 is waaaaay better,"Borrowed this device from a friend of mine who was an ""early adopter"". I spent a full week with it, and read 2 full books. Overall? Not impressed. The design isn't as streamlined as I'd like, and the e-ink is less sharp than on Sony's PRS-505. The wireless feature is neat, when you can get to an area that supports it. Page turning takes longer than the PRS, as well. The color is hideous.Overall, I'll take the Sony. Sleek silver, more streamlined, better clarity, a full $100 cheaper, and I can download my own stinkin' files with ease, and for FREE."
1,Ugly!,"I've been waiting for a ""killer"" ebook ready for a long time. I ""want"" to make the leap. But this is not the product. The design is horrible. Couldn't they have consulted ebook reader fans before committing to a design??? The price is way too much. Plus, I have no desire to have yet ""another"" device to lug around. DRM is a big turnoff as well. This product misses on many levels. I'll stick with audio and real books for now. Maybe version 2.0 will be better but its not there yet. Please Amazon: listen and learn from these reviews... the answers to your products success are clearly listed."
1,newbie needs to know,"I do not have a Kindle or any other reader. I am 77, and have arthritis in my hands, which means I can't read the new translation of ""War and Peace."" I want to know if there is a reader that I could comfortably use without too much prior computer experience. Is the Kindle it? (No, I can't afford it at this time, but would put it on my wish list if I could use it.) And this is the best way I know to ask."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"For the price of this product, I can buy a playstation 3.. which has a blu-ray dvd player included. Dont get me wrong I am a book lover, but most will agree that for $399 it might be more fulfilling to spend that much on the actual books themselves."
4,Visually Impaired and love the Kindle!,"The Kindle has been great for me. The largest font is like reading in 'large print' but there are so many titles to choose from compared to what comes out in large print books. Love, love, love the selection I have available with Kindle! The only problem I have had is losing my place. Ugh! No page numbers! So I have learned to use the bookmark everytime I put the Kindle down. I LOVE to read! With Kindle I read more often and more of what I really want to read!"
2,Not Completely Happy,I have had a number of glitches with my Kindle so I cannot rave about it. I sure like the idea of it. My husband loves his and has not had any problems. So I keep working through mine hoping I will fall in love with it also!
3,Problem Downloading,"I really love the the concept but unfortunately I live in a rural area where the neareat tower to me is in another county 35 miles away. Which means there is no way to get newspapers, magazines, etc.and to look for and order books I have to do it online. When I purchase a book I have to download it to my computer and then from my computer to my Kindle. But I do love the fact of saving trees and that it is so compact. I have arthritis and it is easier than holding a heavy book. So if you live in a rural area I would suggest you check out where you need to be to download. It's just not where people can get a cell phone signal which is what I thought. It has to be where you can pick up the Kindle signal."
2,Just a word about he screen,"Forget about the price, copy protection, and lack of PDF. The key point is the screen and this is where the product fails. Eink is a great idea that just isn't ready yet. The screen can at best be described as grey with type rendered in something just short of black. The contrast is so poor on this and other devices like it that use in other than well lighted conditions is too great a strain on the eyes.If I had it to do over I would wait until they had a display with greater contrast and the background at least approached white."
3,Great step in the right direction - way too expensive,"I read on my Palm Treo so I won't be buying one of these. It's just way too expensive for my budget.Give readers a reason to read on electronics, don't give them an excuse not to."
1,"Too expensive, clunky, and ugly",This unit is way too expensive. It should be free if they expect me to pay $9.99 per book download! Good idea--bad execution.
2,I have read and read,"I have read and read. Finally, I got to what I wanted. After spending $400, I would still have to purchase books to read, as I understand it. No freebies here. If I am wrong, please let me know, someone!But, will not buy until these types of readers are under $200 and offer books for free."
1,Are you kidding?,"$400? No way can a middle income household afford this luxury, particularly in this economy! My Public Library, here I come!"
2,"Worldwide,why not???PDF,why not???","Why didn't you make this work worldwide? And what about pdf files,does it works with pdf??No good!!!"
3,AS TO A $10 charge WHAT?,To the person complaining--& I dont own it either--about $400 up front & $10 per book was ridiculous. SHe's right! She misread it--it's 10 cents NOT $10! dont give it a bad name after poor read thru! Read carefully ALL--that's just good business. WHether you buy it or not.Anonymous
1,Dumb and dumber ....,These things never make it ... maybe when we have paper thin flexible screens ... but little clunky boxes to read ... nope not for me!
1,"Awesome at 39.99, ABSURD at 399.99",You have got to be joking! I can buy a small notebook PC for that. This thing should be 50-60 bucks tops and it will be before long or it will go the way of the dodo - mho
4,Love it,"I had read many of the reviews during my decision process and while I love my Kindle, I do agree with many of the comments. I wish there was a better way to keep the Kindle itself in the case. It has a tendency to fall out unless you hold it in yourself. That bugs me the most. I have found that if I use the elastic strap diagonally across the top right corner it will stay in and work just fine.I do enjoy being able to have some access to the internet also. I hope they continue to improve it.It was an early Christmas present and I really am thrilled with it. No more suitcase full of books when I travel.Overall, I highly recommend the Kindle."
5,Best product I have bought in years!,"The Kindle is amazing! I didn't believe it when I saw it on the web, that the display would truly look like paper - but it actually does! It is very comfortable to hold, easy to navigate, has an ultra long battery life, and is reasonably priced!The ONLY downside to the Kindle (and this isn't the Kindle's issue) is that there are not enough Star Wars books available for purchase. I am trying to read them in chronological order, and only certain books are available - which makes it impossible to read them in order. I don't understand why the complete library isn't available, or at least more books - and more current ones. But that may be a Lucas or Delray issue."
5,Love my Kindle!,"I bought a Kindle a few months ago and absolutely love it. I think the mission of making the device disappear and the story emerge has been fully achieved. I can't believe that a first generation machine can be this good. My one and only ""problem"" is that sometimes my cat rubs against it and changes the page before I'm ready. Changing the print size is great. The screen is very easy on the eyes. The downloading is amazngly fast. I love it, can you tell??? Come on authors, all of you need to make your books available because I won't be buying any more traditional ones.Diane in West Chester Pa."
5,Love it!,"Although I usually wait for later versions of new technologies, I purchased my Kindle due to my scheduled 21 day trip to Europe. Inside my Kindle, and barely denting it's capacity, I brought with me 26 books! It is compact, lightweight, and works beautifully. The built-in dictionary is also a delight. Even if you know the definitions, the ease of the look up function encourages deeper exploration. And, holding the Kindle with one hand while flipping pages with the same hand, always leaves one hand free for that ever-present beverage! Reading in bed, or on the plane, is also much less stressful on the hands with such a super light gadget - as opposed to holding open a heavy book. I truly love my Kindle and cannot wait to see future versions."
5,Best gift I've received in many years,"I have advanced arthritis in my hands and wrists which make the Kindle a great reading tool for me. I love the placement of the buttons, the ability to search for books online and the look of the text (font, size, etc.). I wouldn't change a thing."
4,Kindle Review,Great way to read. Downloads are really fast. Only drawback is that the screen in black and white only. Highlights and book covers would be more effective in color.
5,radically alters how we read,"I have used my Kindle for two weeks during long flights and through the usual long waits in airports. To have a virtual library of choices of fiction, biography - the list is long - is a luxury. The display is easy to read and navigation simple. Buying the ""book"" is a wonder in itself.Now I need a chip in my brain to transfer the knowledge and wisdom from these great works at a faster pace - just ki(n)dd(l)ing.As the technology and device improves will schools in developing countries order a few kindles and have an immediate, storable, vast library at low capital cost?"
1,"Kindle was shipped to Alaska, will not work there","My wife purchased the Kindle for me and had it shipped to our home in Alaska. Unfortunately, the wireless service does not work in Alaska (or Montana). Amazon was apparently unable to point this out during the order process even though our Amazon account is registered in Alaska and the ship to address was Alaska. They do mention the lack of coverage on the website, but should make it much more prominent or provide a warning when someone selects shipping to Alaska or Montana."
1,Difficult to review,"It is difficult to review something one cannot use.The advertisement was misleading. The Product Overview gives a lot of details but ...It implies that Kindle can be used around the world as per this extract from Product Description - Introducing Kindle ""With Whispernet, you can be anywhere, think of a book, and get it in one minute..."" There is nothing that says Whispernet is solely accessible in the States. And not having a credit card issued by an American bank as required for this purchase, prevents me from downloading to my computer.It seems a very good product and I would love to use it but not living in the States makes it impossible to connect to Whispernet. We order books regularly and have had no problem before. It was a nice present from Walter, my husband, but a disappointment to me since I read and travel a lot.Micheline Stepko"
1,Ugly as hell,"What a shame this, otherwise quite appealing device, is ugly as hell. Amazon should have taken a page out of Apple's book rather than the Standard Soviet Design Manual ..."
5,best reading device i've ever had,"the amazon kindle is the best reading product i've ever had, there are some down sides like the buttons to change pages are too sensitive and i have to keep going back cause there is no good place to hold it without hitting the changing buttons. I haven't checked all the other stuff on it yet but i like that i can read in bed and not have to flip through the pages to do so. it's also great to take to the doctor's and read while your waiting for them to call you."
3,I could have done better,"This is a great idea but the execution could stand a lot of refining. It is very difficult to hold. The ""Next Page"" button all the way down the right side and the ""Next Page"" and ""Previous Page"" buttons all the way down the left side - then you have the keys for typing covering the entire bottom - there's no place to put your hands. I was also very disappointed in the cover. It looks like it was designed and made by a fourth grader. I still have mine because I wanted it to work so bad I just kept trying to make it work and went past the deadline to return it. I do like being able to change the font size and also the built-in dictionary. It just seems to me that with a little thought it could have been so much better."
3,Kindle,"This is a great item that I bought for my husband. If it was backlit, like a computer screen, (then you wouldn't need a mini light to read), it would be an awesome item...Great item for traveling and taking more than one heavy book. I hope I get one for Christmas!"
5,Not Activated Yet,I haven't had time to download any books or music yet. I do not havecell phone access in my area and have to download to my computer andI want to have someone talk me through it when I have a little moretime.The Kindle looks great but just haven't had the time to activate it.Thank youK. A. Sitzman
3,kindle,"i like the product, but there should be a way to edit the samples to delete them once you have purchased the book. Also I find that the kindle slips out of the casing and that I seem to be hitting the next page when I try to stop the kindle from slipping."
3,3 Star,"I enjoy the idea of receiving a book in seconds. However, I did not realize I live in an area where it does not work. I have a microwave set up for my computer and thought it would download since I also am on line in an instant.I am disappointed in the screen, GLARE from any light is distracting for reading.I am disappointed in my reading of a first book. When I go back and turn Kindle on, it typically is not where I left off. I do not understand the location numbers, which change every time I turn the page. As an example in the book I am reading location reads 5426-40 I hit prev page and it reads 34?Anyway, I guess I bought it."
3,"It's a cool device, but needs some major improvements imo.","I'd love to see a backlight. I'm sure they'll be able to develop one someday for E-Ink technology. Also movement of the page forward/backwards buttons, seems like no matter how you grab your kindle, you're going to hit one of these buttons. A larger 8 1/2 x 11 screen, Wi-Fi, more color options for the chasis would also be great to see in the futre."
4,Are there hot-links?,"One big advantage of digital document is the feature of links, not only to outside documents (such as dictionary), but within the document, e.g.1. search for word in document,2. author provided hot-links, such as footnotes or references.3. jumps to index page or from index page.Does Kindle have these features? I will wait for them."
4,No coverage overseas,"I work in Egypt, home in the USA twice a year, finding this device of little use -- no coverage overseas. My wife spends six months a year with me, so maybe next year for her. This device does sound perfect for my wife. while I read scientific literature (medicine and astronomy), my wife would find it very useful for many of her book choices."
2,"Good, but priced way too high","I like the product, but the price point is way too high for us masses. Also the lack of color is a major drawback. I would expect future models to cost less and eventually add a color display.It should also have a handle or wrist strap. It is inconvenient to have to carry it around like a book all the time.For now I will wait for the price to drop in a few months. I might try it out now if Amazon offers a 30 or 60 day trial. Then wait for a price drop OR find that I can't live without it."
2,This agression will not stand man!,"Simple put...it's alpha product that simply doesn't fit the bill. Used it for a day and returned it. The cons out weigh the pros. It's supposed to be simple to operate, but I found it not so simple. I had to hard reset the devise because it froze up. Connecting to the kindle store in the NYC area just didn't work. Returned it within 24 hours of use."
2,Great concept but not so great physical design,"I really love the ease of use and the light weight nature of this product but it is very difficult to hold. They didn't design anywhere for your fingers to go and I constantly find myself clicking the 'next page' bars when I don't want to... It is annoying and i'm sure the next version will address this issue. Too bad I didn't wait!!Aside from that issue (which is rather important), the device is great. The reverse out print takes a little getting used to on every occasion but after a few minutes, it is mostly forgotten.I LOVE how much easier it is to use while reading in bed, but again, this is when the problem with the awkwardness of fingers comes into play..."
1,my mistakes,"I purchased this when it was a special on the Oprah Show, and I made two mistakes. I did not check to see if my area received Sprint Wireless, which it does not. I have to travel 20 - 30 minutes to get to aa area I can download books. My second mistake is I wanted to wait to use it because I knew I was having sugery and would be layed up. I quickly went through area downloaded some books but now the medicine I am on makes it hard to concentrate so I can't give a review for a couple of weeks. I will give a better review at that time."
1,Disappointed,"I returned my Kindle. I live in Hawaii. I don't remember being told there was no wireless service available in Hawaii for the Kindle Store access, so when I found out, I immediately returned it. I also learned that most books that interested me were not available for Kindle.Great idea, but not for me!"
2,UGLY,"Beside all the previous reasons why not to buy this reader is, IT IS UGLY.BEGIN RANT:LOOSE THE WHITE CASE AND ACCESSORIES!!! Ever since the first Crapple Ipod, all these portable device manufacturers think the case has to be WHITE. You're out of your minds. Even Crapple offers their device in colors because WHITE IS HIDEOUS!!! Don't you know that a white portable device will look like s**t after a few hundred miles of use. Just do black and leave it alone.END RANT.I still wouldn't buy it for all the other reasons."
3,11 weeks to ship,"The kindle seems like a great device and that it is what so many of us have been waiting for. I commend those who developed this product and am happy to see Amazon.com taking the leadership on this. However there appears to be a problem with execution in the supplying of the Kindle to consumers. We are in the middle of the Christmas season and there is an 11 week wait! It seems that the plan with this is to expand the book market for Amazon.com: So why the lack of supply? I also wonder where this is being manufactured? If in the US then given the large supply of labor shouldn't be a problem.Anyway, being a loyal Amazon customer I look forward to owning one of these some time next year."
1,DOESN'T WORK IN AK OR MT!!,I was so happy to get this item in just a few days!Then I tried to connect to download a book and it doesn't work in Alaska or Montana. What's up with that?! I sadly returned it the same day.
1,"more useless, pathetic technology","The pathetic tech-twerps, who spend their lives in closets, will invent anything to replace the sensuous, the tactile, and the simple. I love the look and feel of books. From the artful covers to the informative jackets and everything in between, you can skip pages, read in any order you want, highlight passages, and appreciate the style it's published in. Once again, the tech-twerps are making this obsolete. Somebody should kick their heads in. I will not have my visual field reduced to a boxed in screen."
2,"Don't have one, but would get one if it were cheaper","I know, I know, reviewing a product I don't have. Overall, I like the device. E-paper is awesome, and the wireless aspect is cool. I also happen to like Mobipocket format (which is what Kindle is) over pdf, much better, IMO. I can get Mobi books from most e-book vendors, like My Bookstore and More and Fictionwise. So unlike Sony, there's pleny of places for me to find material to put on it.The one and only thing stopping me from purchasing this thing, and the only reason for the two stars, is the price. If it were half the price, $200, I'd snatch one up this minute.Five stars on the device (much improved over the early photos, ick!), but two for the cost. Make it cheaper, Amazon!"
2,waiting for second gen,"These seem to be so many positive attributes to Kindle, but the few flaws are bothersome. The deal breaker for me though is that the device dose not do the one thing I had hoped it would do... text-to-speech output. I will buy this or any reader like it that will allow me to listen to, as well as read the books, blogs, news that I wish to receive. I realize that the typical speech output of text-to-speech is not that good and that there is an Audible.com option, but I find the content far too limited through that source. Please add the text-to-speech and I'll have my order ready!"
2,my third kindle,"I am now up to my 3rd Kindle. While the concept of paperless reading and the disposing of my $$$ after I have finished a book or Magazine in the trash is bothersome to me. And now the reason I am on Kindle 3 is because I also entertain the word games as well as reading. NOW THE PROBLEM..... THE LETTERS ON THE KEYBOARD WEAR OFF.I AM UNABLE TO KEEP THIS DEVICE MORE THAN 2 MONTHS. THE LAST KINDLE LASTED ME ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE LETTERS ""A"" ""S"" ""D"" ""L"" WERE COMPLEATLY GONE. I think I now have to look into a device that has different kind of keys."
4,I love my Kindle,"Migrating to an e-reader seemed to make sense to me. I'm an avid reader with a wide range of tastes. I thought that the problem for me would be the loss of that tactile feel, the smell of a book; dog earing pages and so forth.I'm happy to report that I made a successful transition. I'm reading more than ever."
3,"Great item, but $15 is ridiculous for a E-book!","I have had my Kindle since christmas 2009. I love it and have bought and read a ton of books. When i received the Kindle all books were supposed to be 9.99 or less, but now many new releases are 14.99. That is ridiculous considering you cannot share the books with other kindle owners. I will not pay over 9.99 for a book, and have scaled down my kindle purchases because I feel it is simply greed that is driving the prices of these books up. I will continue using my kindle and concentrate on the many free books available."
3,So now you have it - but do you?,"Device is great, print is easy to read. OK, you've learned how to hold it without inadvertently advancing the page. But now you want to read books, right. Woe is you, however, if you are a lover of literary fiction. even Kindle admits it is only 1/50th of books available (~2000). And if you want to browse the titles you have to start at the beginning each and every time. If you want to see the 1,850th title you have to advance through 1,849 titles before you get there. While I am swimming in high tech heaven can't I get to the end of a list without going through it from the beginning. C'mon guys, fix this. It is a real chore to find books to read by browsing. You have to know what you want. AND - No Philip Roth!!! Over 100K books and some of the best authors are missing. I won't bore you with a list (it is very long). There is a lot of room for improvement in getting your buyers connected to books of their liking."
1,Awful. Absolutely awful.,"I was excited to learn about Kindle, but I found out buying books with it locks you into Amazon and the as evidenced by Amazon's recent treatment of 1984 and Animal Farm, the Kindle is built to restrict, not enable what users do. You can't copy, backup, or really do much of anything with your eBooks. Text to speech is ""disabled"" on many books.Do not buy. Absolute rip-off."
5,Great reading,Thanks for coming up with the kindle. I love to read and own tons of books. Many of which I have purchased from Amazon.com. Recently I developed a vision problem impairing my sight in my right eye and making it almost impsibnle to read print. But now since I have my kindle I can enlarge the print and return to reading books. Thank you amazon and Jeff for creating such a wonderfully needed reading device.
5,my kindle,"love it, love it, love it. i carry it with me all the time. most rewarding$ spent. easy to use. i find that i actually read more and actually save $. jane"
1,"""You can't do that with a Kindle.""","$400. For that I expect a lot, or at least, what I've already got on my Palm.1. With Palm, I can direct load *any* open (no Digital Consumer Disablement) text format, including RTF, TXT, HTML, or MobiPocket text via a USB cable and have it readable. I have open-source/free converters for all of the listed formats and don't have to pay for the privilege of loading, say, John Ringo's magnificent ""Sister Time"" into my PDA.You can't do that with a Kindle.2. With Palm, I can transfer text to and from my PDA at work *and* at home, which makes a great way to keep my collection maintained when I buy stuff at work on my lunch hour, download it there, and haul it home.You can't do that with a Kindle.3. My Palm has a backlight, so I can read in bed without disturbing my wife with a booklight.You can't do that with a Kindle.'nuff said. This is worthless e-Trash."
1,Kindle is Not Ready For Market,"The Amazon Kindle is not ready for market and neither is the Amazon technical support team. I received my Kindle two days ago and it crashed seven times. I called tech support and they were only able to tell me ""I understand your frustration but there is nothing that I can do"". I really don't need to say any more. That is enough to put the Kindle in the sucks category."
3,DubaiResponds,I do not like the case - the reader comes out at the most inopportune times. Also have the next page buttons on both sides leads to page flipping at all the wrong times.But the biggest problem I have is living in Dubai where I can not shop on WiFI.Own a Sony and find your product far easier to use for downloading books when I am in the US.
5,tech support,I just wanted to say first of all I have been more than pleased with the amount of customer support I have received from Amazon.com. I was the on who got a defective Kindel to start and I called and Tech Support and they were wonderful about shipping me out another one instantly.I purchased this for my mother for christmas. I have been buying books for her so she can get started right away when she receives it at christmas. I must say I am jealous and am thinking of getting one for myself.
4,Amazon Kindle,Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading DeviceThsi is a great product. One thing that I would change is the side levers that you use to turn the pages. They are too large and I often turn the pages when I do not want to.I like being able to order the books on the Whispernet service. I do not like reading the newspapers on the Kindle because it just not the same as getting the paper.I have read two books so far and I am very satisfied with the experience.
4,the kindle,"Very pleased with the Kindle so far.Pros: Great display. Light weight. Great selection of books and mags. Great technical support.Cons: This may or may not be a con for some, but I'm not crazy about the button layout on the sides. The layout limits how you can hold the Kindle. You almost have to have it in the case. Speaking of, the Kindle falls out of the case easily unless you secure it with some velcro.Great product. The redesign should be even better (although that may not happen for awhile). I had to contact technical support b/c my Kindle stopped connecting to the main server and would not download my purchases or samples. ""Scott"" in technical support was very pleasant and friendly while being very knowledgeable and helpful. We got the problem solved. Just had to reset the thing. Although, he did say you don't want to have to use the reset button alot b/c it's not good for the Kindle.Overall, very happy."
5,Just ordered a 2nd Kindle,"I ordered a kindle a few weeks ago. I thought it was a good enough technology to get one for my wife.It has some drawbacks. The physical design, an anemic web browser, an inability to have two credit card accounts to charge for kindle book purchases (say, one for business and one for personal). The screen is very readable. Wireless access is terrific. It is well suited if you want a portable reader that really works.It's a 1.0 technology and the 2.0 is overdue, buut I can't afford to wait till a 2.0 kindle comes out."
3,Kindle is Not Nimble,"I bought the Kindle that everyone is raving about. Yes I love the fact that it can easily be carried around with you absolutely anywhere. However, it is not that easy to use. Getting from your books menu to the actual book is not the easiest. I usually get the book opened purely through trial and error. The bookmark doesn't always hold the page either. The thing that really bothers me about the device is that due to where the page turn buttons are (one the edges of the device) I am always hitting the buttons and turning the page when I don't actually want to. Overall, I am happy that I no longer have to have a bookcase collecting dust, in my house!"
3,enviromental,This device is excellent it will be saving trees and space in your home besides all the other obvious advances these i find the best. hopefully it will be able to have books that have been out for ages as well. great idea amazon thanks.
2,"Great technology, bad hardware design","It's unbelievable to me that a company such as Amazon can spend three years trying to develop a break thru product and in the end comes up with something that looks like this.WHY??????Even the ad for the product looks like a commercial on QVC. Perhaps that was the idea....How can you develop this sort of product and ignore the kind of attention to detail that companies like Apple are giving to their product design. There is nothing that makes me want to pick up this device and read from it, despite all the technology.I will wait for Apple's version of it, where you can just turn a page with your finger on a touchbase COLOR screen."
1,Watch out international buyers,"It would be wonderful to be able to use this device. Amazon was ready to charge my kindle device order with an internationally issued credit card yet they are unable to sell me content with the same credit card. Thus it is a very expensive piece of nothing! Cannot use it, no warning anywhere during the purchase process! So watch out!"
5,The Best,"I am so impressed. Kindle is much more than I anticipated. Downloads are fast and the ease of use is incredible. I have begun having trouble reading regular print, especially paperbacks, and sometimes print gets too close to the binding. Kindle's adjustable print is a winner."
4,Kindle for frequent travelers,"Got the Kindle about a month ago, totally pleased overall. The downloads are fast and the reading is easy. Takes a while to get used to where to put your thumb - it would have been nice if the Next Page bar on the right hand side didn't run all the way the full length. The only serious design flaw I can relate is that the leather cover, although great when closed, doesn't hold the Kindle very securely when opened, and yet is a little too stiff to fold all the way back out of the way like a paperback book cover. That needs some work.Minor stuff. The device is great - I took 4 books on an 8 day trip, it packs like it was one book, and you never have to root around in your luggae at 30,000 feet for another book after you finish the first one."
5,Awesome!,"The Kindle is so well thought out and designed for ease of use. Much cooler than I thought--and I thought it would be cool! Light weight, comfortable, even in my small hands. Downloading is a snap and being allowed to read 2 chapters before purchasing is a great feature. Congratulations on this winning product, Amazon!"
5,FANTASTIC,"[[ASIN:B000FI73MA Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device: This item is fantastic,very handy, I do not have to carry around books when I travel. I love the fact that I can look for books at my own time and that the price for books are so reasonable."
4,Lack of password protection is a serious flaw.,"The Kindle is a great product, easy to navigate and easy to read.However, the ability of anyone to pick up the Kindle and order and charge dozens of books and magazines to your credit card without a single identifying question being asked is a serious flaw.A child could easily order a number of items just by navigating the screen.I brought the Kindle with me on vacation and was afraid to put it down for a minute."
4,kindle,"this is a great product. wish it had a light in it..since I read a lot at night and in bed or on an airplane in the dark. Sometimes the kindle goes back to ""neverland"" and I can't figure out why. The ease in downloading is great. Also, wish I could separate the completed books from the books not read.thanks"
4,Almost Very Happy,"My wife (Mary Ann) and I have enjoyed our new Kindle's for about one month now. The product design,ease of use and convenience is great. The only feature we are not satisfied with is the protective Kindle cover. The covers seem to have been developed as an afterthought with little attention fit and practicality. The top and bottom positioning tabs located near the cover binding do not align and secure the Kindle's properly. No matter how carefully we insert and secure our Kindle's, if we don't hold them in manually they fall out of the cover.We hope these comments are useful for future product improvments."
3,"Kindle's cool, BUT......","I got a Kindle for Christmas, and it is kind of amazing really but I find that when the battery needs charging, I just go to one of my paper books and the Kindle sort of sits until I can go dig up the manual and box to get the cords and charge it. Consequently, I have only read about a chapter or so of the book I downloaded. Also the page turning bars are so touchy that I find myself constantly having to go back to the page I'm reading and re-find my place. This is so distracting that I just put it down in frustration. There is no inner light so it can't be read unless you have a book light, and the one I have won't clip on unless you have the kindle in it's case. I could go on a bit more and add pros to the cons, but this review page keeps clicking off and on and is wildly distracting. Perhaps more later...."
3,enjoy using this,"while the book selection is good, the magazine choices are limited. AND the newspaper selection is poor. East and west coast is covered...what about the midwest?"
3,$400 is too much,"I'm very interested in the device but $400 is way overpriced. Mr. Bezo, please listen to your customers and lower the price to about $200 and you'll have a big winner."
4,Kindle review,"I was so excited to get my Kindle! I actually ordered 3 of them (gave 2 away as gifts). I love it! The only thing that I think could be an improvement would be if the screen had an option to ""illuminate""...that way you could read in the dark. I've told so many people about it! It's so easy to use and believe me...I'm not the most ""tech savy""."
5,Love the Kindle,"I love the Kindle. It is easy to set up and use. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the cover that it comes with is not great. It slips out of it easily and it is hard to turn on while in the cover. Should have a hole at the back of the cover where the on/off switch is for easier access. Other than the, case I think it is the greatest item for readers."
5,"Save trees, buy Kindle!","Bottom Line:Buy Kindle as a replacement of a hardcover book. That is the main reason I bought Kindle.The portability and light weight is what I was looking for and it does all that and does it well. This is why I gave 5 stars.Don't buy Kindle as a stand-in for your PDA, Cell Phone, Laptop, Desktop, MP-3 player and such.Don't buy Kindle for internet browsing, emailing and such.Now as a stand-in for a hard cover 2"" thick book it is priceless. I could hold it in one hand in my bed, chair, lounge with very little light falling on it and still read it comfortably. The line width and line spacings are perfect for me for fast reading and are far less stressful on the eyes than a printed page which has wide lines and less white space between lines.The only side-effect of having a Kindle is, I will be reading far more books than I normally do now. In that sense it is a time sink during my busy period. But it is a boon during a retitrement or vacation period.Happy Kindling."
4,Kindle,I am totally satisfied with the Kindle. It is so nice to be on vacation and not carry so many books. I would like to recommend possible future accessories: Attachable light and a different (durable) cover.
5,Kindle,"Bought the Kindle for my Husband for Christmas who is an avid reader. After watching the Oprah show, I thought this would be a great earthly friendly economical gift! Haven't even opened the box yet, it's wrapped up and under the tree. I'm so excited to give it to him! My question is, can I buy books, newspapers, magazines now without having opened it so that when he does, there is already some reading material on there? Or do I need some kind of code number that might be inside the box? Thanks for you help and support.Rhonda Tinti from Rio Linda"
2,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"After spending 2 weeks on & off trying to connect to wi-fi I decided to ring the helpline. I spent 1 hour 15 mins on hold before eventually giving up. Sadly have had to return my Kindle. Come on Amazon, where is your customer service?"
2,Amazon Kindle,"I bought my Kindle at Staples. The device was defective 12 days after I bought it (5-way key pad). Accessories were overpriced. 39.99 for service contract? Look around, you can find better values, both for the device and for the accessories. Get a Nook!"
3,Bad Customer Service,"I ordered the kindle using the free shipping option. The kindle was sent to the wrong location. I contacted Amazon service and I had to literally argue for five minutes with the guy on the phone that the address I provided was correct. He literally accused me of providing an invalid address. I live in a sixty year old house on a well established street. So no, my address was not invalid. He then offered to send it overnight and the package arrived the next day.The kindle is fine, although I'm extremely unhappy with customer service accusing me of making a mistake on my address, especially in the manner and tone it was done."
3,"nice, but limited selection","it is too expensive. but works well. easy on the eyes, and it is nice to get a paper no matter where you are. but the book selection is pretty thin. very mixed feelings."
3,I like the concept,"This looks like a great product. I would actually like to have one myself, but not at $399! At $199 I'd jump on it! I have piles of books around here I really don't need. If they were all on a single device, easy to read, that would be great. If I could get all the Books I'm interested in, that's would be another plus. I don't think it's the Best Looking device, but it's functional, and looks pretty simple to use which is really all the matters. I gave it 3 stars mostly because of the price, with a half a star to the looks. Plain white, and the buttons maybe could have been done a bit better. I don't get the name, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I would still buy one at $199!"
2,Mac users beware,"If you are a Mac owner you can't download free e-books and read them on Kindle. The only program for converting and using .pdf files is Windows-centric, MobiPocket Creator. There is no Mac program that will do the trick. That is a major problem for the tens of millions of Apple Computer owners. The price of Kindle is a major problem for me. Still, I salute Amazon for trying and I hope that they can resolve these problems soon. The concept is a good one."
1,Be very aware,"I purchased my kindle in July, I loved it. I took it everywhere! It slipped off my lap (about 26"" to the floor) ITS BROKEN. There is nothing Amazon will do for me, I am out the $360 for the kindle pluse several hundred dallars in books! There is no repairs services available! My advice is to wait to purchase the kindle until repair services come available."
2,Canadian Credit cards not acceptable for use with a Kindle,"For two months I have been using the kindle, getting used to it's nuances but overall enjoying it. Today I tried to buy three books through the kindle store and was not able to. When I phoned the support line the response was ""it is our policy not to sell kindle documents to customers who do not have a US billing address"" It was bought with a Canadian Credit card, I bought several Kindle version books using the Cdn credit card over the past two months, I am/or maybe was receiving a subscription to Time magazine using the Cdn credit card.I have been buying hard print books using the same credit card and having the books delivered here to my home in Arizona. What is this? My credit card is honored globally but not for Kindle?Now I am told to pack up the kindle and send it back, and a ""sorry but that's our policy"" !!! Well I'm not happy in Arizona."
1,"PDF support, deal breaker","The lack of direct pdf support is an absolute deal breaker. I have been patiently awaiting this release and I find the product quite disappointing. While the EVDO support seems interesting it is ridiculous that all content must be added via this link. When the device is capable of directly being connected to a computer via usb, it is silly to have to transmit content via Sprint to be converted (and be charged for this service). The price of the device is high but not necessarily out of range when looking at the alternatives, most directly the Iliad and the Sony Ebook reader. Being a technology consultant I patiently wait for the day when an eink device comes out that would allow me to read all of the technical documents that absolutely dominate my profession without jumping through hoops or paying as much as much as a low end notebook computer. Truly disappointing and I can only predict that this device will fail unless hacked to be more usable."
5,Keen on Kindle,"As a booklover for 60 plus years I am surprised at how much I love the Kindle reading experience. I can order and receive a book in moments, sit back with a glass of iced tea, set the print to a size I like and proceed to get lost in my favorite passtime.I did not expect the ease of use this device allows. The tech explosion did not come in my youth so I lack the second nature understanding of electronic products; but the Kindle is set up so that everything just falls into place and the instructions are clear and make steps obvious and simple.And I did not expect all the reading activities to be present--I can underline, make notes and I confess--I can easily engage in my habit of reading several books at once (with no need to search for where I left the second book).What a wonderful experience. I'm grateful to Amazon for such a sweet blending of old and new."
4,Does what I expected. Great concept.,"Fun product! Makes reading books easy and love the ability to carry many with me - or grab off the wireless whatever strikes me. Works well for newspapers like the Wall Street Journal. Tried a magazine - Time. That was a poor fit for this device, especially the Time implementation which does not even try to bring over any graphics. This is not a tool for enjoying magazines from my experience.The screen is easy to read. However, I find the buttons down the left and right used for turning pages to have a very fragile plastic feel to them. I am concerned they won't last a long time - very flimsy feel of thin plastic.I have found the ability to pull down samples of books to be a great feature. This try before buy approach works well with the Kindle concept."
3,Amazon Kindle,"It remains to be seen whether the Kindle can make a big dent in paper type reading materails. It's certainly handy. My daughter is a flight attendant; the device is excellent for her because of small size, portability, and ease of downloading books."
2,Not under the pillow!,"I was given my first Kindle a year ago, and three Kindles have packed up on me within the year. I only used the Kindle to read in bed, and kept it under the pillow the rest of the time. I can only assume that the pressure of my head on the pillow has destroyed the screen somehow, so I would advise against keeping it under the pillow or alternatively advise keeping it in a case.Amazon readily replaced the first two that packed up but unfortunately the third time was just outside the one year warranty period. After one year, there is no repair option, though Amazon may offer some concession on a replacement.On the plus side, I was surprised that I readily adjusted to the Kindle format and found it much easier reading in bed with the Kindle than with an ordinary book.The moral is be very careful about putting any pressure on the screen when it's not being used as Amazon are reluctant to admit that the device is vulnerable if you inadvertently pressurise the screen."
3,accessories not included- sometimes,"The 1st Gen Kindle I received from Networth had a defective battery (wire in module broken) but more importantly the kindle did not come with a power supply or a book cover as indicated in the product description. In an email I received from Networth they explained ""This item comes without any accessories"" and I should return it for a refund since it was not working. I did reorder another 1st Gen Kindle after returning the first one. The second Kindle did come with a power cord and a book cover but it does lock up at least once a day which requires a manual reboot with a safety pin. So basically when ordering the refurbished Kindle you may or may not receive a power cord or book cover and your kindle will most likely have a few issues but it is a cheap alternative if you want one that doesn't need wifi to work."
3,fairly cool at first,"I scored my kindle last November when they were 400BUX.I loaded her up and read quite a few books while recovery from major surgery.You can read fast with this thing.The design is a bad joke,all weirdassed angles and you can't pick itup without changing a page or two or three.The tiny piece of cardboard tab that ""holds"" the cover on lasted about three days.Once you get used to the silly design it is a fairly cool device.Biggeset gripe is my kindle no longer will buy a book.It USED to work beautifully but no more.To buy a volumne I have to go to this site to purchase stuff.Not so cool.When attempting to buy books right from kindle I get a promt saying to try back latter, for four months and counting.Wait for the next generation and save dough and aggravation. UPDATE:January 2009. Guess what? All the issues I was having with this Kindle disappeared when I moved.My last apartment was in a basement and that was the problem.I now live on the 5th floor and I'm back in business.JOY!!!"
2,The Kindle could be so much better,"The Kindle is an acceptable e-reader at best. It's real value is with the deals that Amazon is making with the publishers and the cell connectivity.I have 5 criticisms of it:1. When it is powered on, it is difficult to pick it up without turning a page; I would put the buttons along the back sides so the screen could be larger (assuming #2 below is not possible);2. The screen should be touch-enabled; it could then be full length, with a keyboard that would appear only when needed (the screen refresh time would have to be reduced to make this work well, but there is already a big latency between the key press and the appearance of a letter anyway); this would also remove the need for the the roller thing to select from menus;3. The bottom right and left corners should be rounded off so it would be more comfortable to hold;4. The power switch should be on the front;5. It really, really, really needs a hierarchical, folder-based storage system for content."
4,Satisfied,I am a proud owner of the Kindle. I appreciate that I can read the newspaper without all the distractions of advertisement.I appreciate the quickness of the book downloads.
4,NONNA'S KINDLE,"I AM ENJOYING MY KINDLE. I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME IMPROVEMENTS. ONE WOULD BE LOCATING THE ON-OFF BUTTON IN A MORE CONVIENT PLACE. ALSO THE NOTEBOOK HOLDER DOES NOT HOLD THE KINDLE, IT KEEPS SLIPPING OUT AND I AM AFRAID I WILL DROP IT. THE SPEED OF RECEIVING THE BOOKS IS GREAT AND READING THE SCREEN IS VERY EASY."
2,Kindle,"I found the kindle hard to use. It was hard to hold it and read and not press the ""next page"" button, so I was always skipping pages then found it hard to go back. There is no place for your hands to hold the kindle."
3,Kindle,"Overall I like the Kindle.Pros. The font is clear and easy to read, just as you would with a paper book. The dictionary feature is the greatest part, love that.Cons. Not so easy to hold, keep hitting the next page button or worst, other buttons which take me somewhere else in the book, not so simple to go back where you were.Suggestions. built in light would be nice. A picture of what the real book looks like (as if it was opened) page by page would be very helpful for those of us that are more ""visual"" so you know where you actually are."
4,Night Light?,A great machine but why not backlit to read at night without turning on the bedside light. Maybe Kindle 3.
4,It's a good device,"I enjoy using the Kindle. It is convenient, easy to use, and a good selection of books to download. The only frustration I have is the buttons are mistakenly pressed and I'm constantly going back and forth. I would prefer the buttons to be in a spot that I don't push all the time. That's just me though. The cover that comes with the Kindle is useless. I mostly keep my Kindle out of it unless I'm traveling with it. All in all, it is a very good device and I enjoy it."
4,Great reading device,"This little device is awesome, especially the cellphone connection to replenish books. The only negative is the sharp corners on the bottom which bite into your hands after a while. I tried reading with the book cover, but found that to be uncomfortable. Also I would recommend against using the entire right side to go to the next page and the left side for previous, just a small section would suffice. I am forever moving to the next page or previous page when I shift the hold on the unit. Also I would recommend a smoother transition to the next/previous page. The flashing in between is a little annoying. I would hope that with enough feedback the next edition will be perfect. Still with all the aforementioned issues I am going to buy a second one for my wife since she keeps using mine."
1,battery issues,"I have had 3 kindles and all have had battery issues. The battery will not hold a charge after I have had the kindle for about 3 to 6 weeks. If I try to resolve the issue, I have to sit on a chat line for a long time, then get transferred to a 'specialist' and sit on the chat line while the party seems to be working with multiple people at a once. then I get sent a reconditioned unit that also doesn't work. This is without a doubt the worst electronic device I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. it is money thrown away!"
1,Kindle keyboard,"I really enjoyed my kindle keyboard until today. I removed it from charger, went to turn it on, & it went haywire. There are pixilated lines running horizontally & vertically. I called customer service & was told once those lines show up the device is DONE!!!! No way it can be fixed. I've had the kindle for 18 months, did NOT put much wear & tear on it. Didn't drop it. Didn't get it wet. Amazon tells me I can purchase a new one. The warranty is only 1 year. I don't know that I even want to purchase another. I think it's disgusting that they do not stand behind their products. It's probably better to buy the book from my local bookseller instead of supporting amazon. Or maybe I'll purchase a nook."
4,Darn good for first attempt,"I bought the Kindle because I travel and have moved to a condo with far less storage. I was willing to put up with the 'clunkiness"" for convenience. Well, was I surprised! Within 10 minutes I was in love with it. I read two books, then picked up a paperback, and read it. Couldn't wait to return to the kindle.There are some improvements they need,such as moving the on/off switch to the front; being able to select which part of memory to display from the home screen; and a way to disable the back button which I keep hitting.In short, it is well worth the investment."
5,Kindle,"I absolutely love my Kindle, especially because downloading new books is quick and easy. It's a great device, and I highly recommend it to any book lovers or people on the go. Great product, Amazon!"
5,Kindle-I love this e book reader!!!!!,I am so glad I bought one of these. They are so convenient! They are small and are great to read from. The type is perfect and can be adjusted. There is no glare. I just love everything about them. Good bye to real books. No more clutter! Yeah!!!!
4,Traveler's Dream,"I travel overseas extensively and despite what they tell you, laptops are not/not durable. I have gone through 6 in 8 years. Since I normally do not have internet access when I am abroad, I carry my reading materials on the laptop. Now with Kindle, I don't have to depend on a laptop and I can carry my reading wherever I go. OOOHHRAHH.Problems: Where I live in the States, I do not have access to the Sprint network, so I have to either download my books to my computer and then transfer them to the Kindle, or, wait till I go to somewhere that I can connect to the Sprint network. Not serious, but irritating.Altogether, I'm pleased.Mike HoganKindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device"
4,"If you're a reader, you're going to love this!!","I'm sure this has been said time and time again, but I love my Kindle.I love the idea of it, and the ease of it.It is easy to navigate around, and the screen is easy to read.I've read several books on my Kindle already and the experience is that of reading a book, only better. The device is light and comfortable in the hands.My only complaint is that I turn pages when I do not intend to.If you've been thinking about a Kindle, give it a try, you're gonna love it too."
5,Excellent,"I treated myself to a birthday present. I ordered the Kindle Thursday night and Friday at 10:00 AM had it in my hands. It is amazing. I am an avid reader and love how easy it is to get the latest bestsellers in seconds and for less than half the price. I was able to operate it just by scanning thru the manual. The cover was a little hard to put in place but once on it felt just like a regular book but much lighter. I am in love with my Kindle and will recommend to friends and family. Of course, it is a little pricey, but is worth it in the long run."
5,"""How do you say, 'I love you, Kindle!' - without getting personal?""","""Thank you, Amazon.com, for inventing this really neat electronic device, The Kindle! It works great for downloading books, newspapers, magazines and for connecting to the internet. I can get my E-Mails when I'm out and about, and if necessary, I can go home and open up more complicated E-Mails. I really appreciate having certain subscriptions automatically downloaded every morning and waiting for me to read them. Getting a chance to sample the books or other subscriptions before actually buying them is really handy. THIS KINDLE ROCKS!""Larry D. NuttingWausau, Wi."
5,Kindle,"I purchased the Kindle for myself as a graduation present from college. I love to read books and after many years of reading textbooks, I can enjoy any book with a click and start reading. It is simple and with the built in dictionary I find it the greatest little electronic device to be found. I can adjust the font size and makes for easy reading. I am very happy with my Kindle and highly recommend."
4,"Love it, but it needs redesign","First, I must say that I LOVE my Kindle! The electronic paper is good to my eyes after hours of reading. The instant purchase and receipt of books are amazing! However, the design is clunky and it really takes some maneuvering to avoid changing pages. I cannot understand why the designers thought we needed almost all of each side of the ""book"" to find a way to change pages. Not at all necessary, and I'm betting that the next generation will have taken care of this. The scroll and select button is too easy to miss with. That said, I still love it.I haven't begun to explore all the ways to use it, because I keep reading books! Go figure.I just hope that Amazon will consider us bold pioneers who bought the ""first edition"" of Kindle and give us some kind of break on future editions.I LOVE MY KINDLE! Even with the minor problems.Cheryl Gaston"
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!!","I got my Kindle for my Birthday, it was delivered 12/1. I love it so much, it goes everywhere with me."
5,Wow! I love this product,"I'm completely satisified. The display is amazing. It's light and convenient. The books are cheaper and lighter than paper. I've got several books with me and can choose which one I want to pick up. I can turn the page with one hand. When I go to the cafe or get on a flight now, this is the only book I bring. You can see more info at kindlegeek.com."
5,fabulous,The Kindle is a wonderful accessory to have. I can see clearly on it andit is so convenient to take on vacation. I really am enjoying it.
4,Very Good But Some Tweaking Needed,"The Kindle is compact and easy to use. Downloading a book is quick and easy and the ability to preview a book is an added plus. Overall I'm very happy with the Kindle. However it is pricy but the ""Oprah"" deal was the catalyst for my buying it.I'm disappointed that the direct help feature was dropped, I believe it was call NOW NOW, and help for downloading MP3 music was not available. The on off switch is located on the back of the unit and when reaching for it you inadverantly turn to the next page. These are minor complaints and overall I rate this as a very good product.I had also looked at the Sony and although it is less expensive (unless you get the Oprah discount for Kindle)I didn't find it as good."
4,"The ""green"" alternative to books in print.","I really love this device. My only complaint is that the page turn buttons on the sides are just a bit too big. It is easy to accidently turn the page (this is the only reason I didn't give it five stars). I wish the buttons were just a bit smaller so that there would be a place to grip on the edge without turning the page. Other than that, I love being able to shop and purchase books whenever I need one, look up words in the dictionary on the fly, and change the font to a bigger size in the evening when my eyes are tired. Wireless access to the web and the availability of book samples before buying are also a plus. It is great for travel since it reduces the weight in my carry-on bag."
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!,"I love my Kindle and the fact that I can travel with so many books all contained in this small parcel. I am also delighted that I can download a book or newspaper most anywhere in the USA. Another important feature is that I can access the news on-line, thus keeping up with the latest news without having to travel with my laptop. I would like to see additional news agencies represented other than MSNBC and the BBC, especially Fox News.I am now on my third Kindle, the new Kindle Brightpage and love it. I didn't care much for the Kindle Fire and returned it.All in all I give Kindle 5 BRIGHT STARS.Thank you.Phil G. GiriodiScottsdale, Arizona &Kailua, Hawaii"
4,Reading On The Go,This is a fun and convenient way to take your books with you although a little pricey. The downloading is easy. It took a few tries to understand the paging and and clicking the button but relatively simple. I am still trying to master getting to a specific page (but I have not really attempted learning that part). Great present for your avid readers!
4,A readers dream,"I love to read and this is a truly great gift. I loved it so that I brouht on for my daughter also. The ability to order a book right from the kindle or online and have it minutes is a really neat feature.There is only one drawback that I have, they only give you limited direction on the use of the Kindle. You have to go online for the complete direction guide on how to use the reader."
5,Certain to be a revolution in reading!,Will have as much effect on how people read as the Commodore 64 did on computing. Brilliant technology!
5,Simply Amazing,"I've had my Kindle reader for approx. 3 weeks. All I can say is it's downright Amazing! Who would ever think this small reader could do so much--- I've subscribed to a blog, previewed chapters of books I'm interested in reading. Shopped for books. Downloaded a few free editions, purchased some of my favorite authors books and read several books already. It is simply great fun! ---and I've already decided I will never be without a Kindle. I'm in my 60's and like techie gadgets anyway---but the Kindle is my most impressive purchase recently---and more useful than most too. If you like to read and want to save money on book puchases, this is the way to go."
4,bobc7bobc7,Perfect... almost. Needs to have a front turn off option. And a light source. Otherwise a great product with lots of books to view.
5,Gayle's Kindle Review,"From the idea to the marketing ""addeds"" (such as the ""book"" design of the packaging and carrier) to the look-up functionality, Amazon.com library retention, wireless download capability and speed, it's a total consumer experience.My only question, and I cannot locate the answer in the in-Kindle User Guide or printed Usage Guide, is how do I know when the battery is charged and why if WhisperNet and the Kindle are both in the off setting does the battery loose charge? I just downloaded my first book and have only used the User Guide in Kindle to-date and yet my battery was depleted and required re-charging."
2,It cost what?!? Surely you must be joking....,"Market a brand new, first generation, unproven technology that is supposed to be paradigm changing - release it in an unstable (and receding) economy and charge an astronomical amount for it????? When you expect customers to immediately buy their favorite reading material from it??!! Who came up with that recipe for taking what should be a great product in the long run and dooming it from the start? Sad that such a promising idea is crippled by greed and poor market entry strategy before it can even get a foothold. Oh but wait, I almost forgot, the shipping is free! Someone in marketing at Amazon has an interesting sense of humor..."
1,No PDF??,"Why would I buy an expensive device that did not read PDF?? If I want to use this for work it would be useless. I also already have a library of books and docs in pdf and other formats. They seem to be useless with this device.Come on, it is a good idea, but get rid of the stupid limitations and make it functional."
1,Let me get this right...,"Let's see... Pay $400 for a gadget then pay $20, $30, $40 for a book to read. OK I don't have to turn the pages. Am I missing something?Apple squeezed the RIAA to get songs for $.99. Can Amazon do the same?"
5,I love my Kindle!,Before I bought my Kindle I read all the reviews here and elsewhere that I could find. That was helpful in deciding between the Sony Reader and Kindle. I don't know about the Sony Reader as I never have actually used one but I love the Kindle!There are some draw backs that are listed in many reviews. The only real one that I have is that it does advance the page too easily. However that is a minor thing that you can adjust to.Sure it is not the sexiest looking device but it works for what I want it to do. I travel a lot and have never before been able to take larger books with me on the road due to their weight. With Kindle I take an entire library! It is great and easily readable.I gave it five stars and recommend it highly!
4,Traveling Reader,"I am a person who loves to travel and loves to read...and I combine them quite a bit. Since the airline industry is becoming increasing concerned with luggage weight, I decided to invest n the Kindle so that I can take many books with me on my travels! I will try it out in December when I go for a 21 night cruise."
5,Amazon Kindle,"The greatest thing since sliced bread!!! I can ""buy"" a book and start reading in a few seconds. And the dictionary in it is so helpful."
5,Generic Comment,Does what it needs to do well. Page back button is clicky and the scroll wheel is loud if I'm in bed trying to be quiet.
2,I won't buy without these...,"Product is very appealing, but I won't buy until it will accept .pdf files without having to be converted and offers optional backlighting."
1,bookem,"The concept is a good one, but 400 dollars? I would pay $49 to $99 for the product as is. The value isn't there to spend $400. Also in this day and age at the very least I would expect a color screen. This product has some great ideas. I saw Mr. Bezos on Charlie Rose. I wish he would have addressed the price point of the hardware. Also, at least for me, the book does not disappear when I read. The book itself is very much a part of the reading process. I love books. I hope the day doesn't come when all books will be standardized e junk. Sometimes the tactile quality matters when reading.Lower the price and I'll buy one in a minute for all the trashy, fun and sometime informative reading I do while traveling or on holiday."
3,The huge flaw,"For novels- it's brilliant! I've seen a friends and after losing thousands of books, my library of a lifetime in the New Orleans flood it's attractive.The problem is that the lions share of those books had pictures.90%. In color. Most of what I read is heavily illustrated, even the New York Times. What would the Times be with no color and pictures? Fashion Week and Art Fair Week coverage would be pretty lame without the pictures. Even war and peace news has glorious color photographs- which I wouldn't get.So great for some things, but I can't imagine Elle or Vogue on this. And it's a brilliant concept- by very non visual people. Even news magazines are enlivened by excellent color photography- do we want US News and World Report bereft of illustration?I'll keep buying art books and how to tomes in ten pound lots, thank you."
2,Books too expensive and most not on Kindle,"I bought a Kindle after watching Oprah talk about it on her show. While it is a good idea to have all your books in one small notebook, don't believe the idea that the books are a lot less than a print book. The last book I bought was only $2 less than the hardcover. And also, there are many books that are not yet on Kindle, so I still have to purchase them in hardcover. There are no graphics, but I understand the Kindle 2 has newer features. If I had to do it over again, I would wait until the price is reduced both on the Kindle and the books and a lot more books are available on Kindle."
5,nuff said,"I now own three Kindles. Mine (the first one I bought) and, after using it for several weeks, one for my wife and one for my son. Nuff said."
3,Kindle reader,"I need a device for storing hundreds of documents and didn't purchase it for reading books. Unfortunately, Amazon was unable to ever get my docs uploaded. I work for a major university with a corresponding firewall, and the Kindle folks could never tell me why they were not receiving my emails with docs attached. We've had the same email system for 20 years, and no one else has ever had issues receiving my mail. So, I sent it back. Also, the keyboard on the bottom is overkill for my planned use. I have received the Sony 505 ebook unit, and, while I may have some issues categorizing my docs, it definitely is easier to move docs from my computer to the uit."
3,not easy to use,"The problem with the kindle is the buttons are misplaced. The whole edge moves to different pages. Just a slight touch and you lose your place.Therefore it makes it difficult to hold because one always grabs the side edge to hold it and it moves you away from what you are reading. There needs to be only small push buttons easily located to give commands. The other problem is one pays to high a price for montly subscriptions. The other problem is they don't give you an operators manual to look up how things work. They want you to look everything up in the electonic manual, which is very time consuming and not efficient."
3,Page Turning,It's to easy. In fact it is almost impossible to use this e-book and not turn a page. It is very awkward to hold. No matter were you grab it a page turns. Very frustrating. Much easer to buy new books and down load than Sonys e-book.The cover is also annoying in that the e-book keeps falling out of it.Is not as cozy to use as the Sony e-book. The Kindle has more features but lacks the friendly user feel that Sony e-book has while reading it in bed at night before sleeping. U and sony should get together and pool your resources
4,Great but could use some improvement,"The problem I have so far is that the pages ""turn"" too easily. Maybe if the page bar wasn't so big. I have to get used to it. I would not reccommend it for a man with big hands as he will go crazy holding it too delicately so as not to turn the page every 2 seconds.The ease to which a book transfers is amazing. its easy to use and transport.I am also having a problem putting it to ""sleep"" its sometimes takes a few tries.I love the dictionary feature..brilliant. And being able to change the fonts is wonderful."
5,AWESOME!,"I could not have asked for more! This is perfect for reading anywhere, any time.Ok, so i've loved my Kindle since the day I got it, but THE BEST part is the awesome service! Not only are my books delivered on time every time, but when I dropped mine, there was no hassle about getting it replaced. I just called customer service and they arranged to send me a new one in a few days. All I had to pay was the shipping to send the old one back. I am so relieved! Thank you Amazon, this is well worth the price."
5,Need more conservative blogs for Kindle,"I love my new kindle. I find I'm reading more because it is easy on my eyes. My only complaint is that I'd like to have access to more conservative blogs. The ones you have a great. However, I'd like to get Human events, Ann Coulter, etc.Thanks."
4,"Good, but not as good as current generation","I think that goes without saying. This version is good, but it features slow page turning and the keys are hard to press. It will work great for anyone who doesn't need a ton of speed, or who isn't a hardcore user. Everyone else should go with the newer version."
5,Enjoy on the go reading,Absolutely love this product. There are tens of thousands of books etc available in seconds. I find this a wonderful product for people who travel. Also saves lots of space in my bookcase.
5,Sliced Bread,"The Kindle is truly the neatest thing since sliced bread. I love it! Where ever I take it people are curious and want a demonstration. The price is a little prohibitive; however for an avid reader the initial cost will soon be made up in amazon kindle book savings over hard covers or paperbacks. The only down side for me is my cell reception where I live, so it's sometimes difficult to get onto the Kindle site."
4,Amazon's Kindle,"I purchased my Kindle approximately three weeks ago. For me, the best part of owning a Kindle is the convenience of choosing a book and having it at my fingertips within 15 seconds. I plan on purchsing a Kindle for my daughter for Christmas; a perfect gift for the person who loves to read!"
4,amazon kindle,i was given the amazon kindle for xmas. i love reading and there are books all over my home. the kindle is great i can download books and take it anywere it connects to wifi effortlessly. the only down fall is it has no back light so u still have to read with the light on at night that still anoys my other half. it wud b nice to have it in colour for the mags n news papers but for 109 and the fact it is for primeraly reading books u cant complain
4,My Kindle,I just absolutely love the Kindle. The downloading of books is so easy and I have been able to find every book I want. The only negative I have found with the Kindle is that I wish it was backlit so you didn't have to have a light to attach.
5,Kindle The Mgic Reading Device,"[[ASIN:0307266931 War and Peace]I purchased Kindle last December, and it has been great for my reading; especially when I travel I no longer need to carry so many books. Kindle is so smart that it carries for my volumes of books electronically. Actually, i can carry a small home library in Kindle. In addition, I can do annotations and take notes for my research, without needing a pencil or papers. i think Kindle is a dream of avid readers that has been realized by smart peace technology."
4,"Read, read, read",I have never read so much as I have since I received my Kindle....it is wonderful. My only complaint is that I often inadvertantly turn the pages - especially when attempting to close or open. It is a little difficult to hold without touching the page controls. I can hardly wait to load it up and do some traveling.
5,Awesome,"I have been reading these reviews for almost a month now, eagerly awaiting the kindle as a gift for Christmas. Christmas Eve came and I haven't put it down! Any negatives are far outweighed by the postives. It has re-kindled my love of reading!"
5,Amazing!! Totally satisfied!!,"I ordered my Kindle about a month ago, and it finally arrived yesterday. I have to say, it is simply the best ebook reader device I've ever used. I'm already half way through my first book on the Kindle. When I use the Kindle, after a few minutes, the Kindle disappears, and I'm right in the story on the printed pages. It's ergonomically designed. It comes with a really nice leather cover, which I'm using. It makes the kindle feel like I'm holding a book. I hope the Kindle really catches on."
4,kindling,"the kindle is amazing - easy to use, lightweight, good legibility. a few minor complaints: the cover doesn't stay in place, the side controls (which turn the pages) are super sensitive, so frequently turn a few pages instead of just one at a time. the downloading is super quick and easy -- do kind of miss handling a real book, the cover, flipping the pages if you want to re-read something - but the kindle is a great device. especially convenient when traveling."
4,Kindalized,"The first time I used a handheld TI calculator, I had the feeling that I had entered a new dimension. The same holds true for OUR new Kindle. The tug-of-wars over who is going to use it will only end when the next Kindle arrives. Surely, I can think of numerous improvements, which will be forthcoming in future models. That should not deter anyone from buying and enjoying this new lightweight portable electronic book/newspaper/audio."
5,A very neat toy,"This is indeed a neat toy. I read all the reviews and, yes, there will soon be upgrades and it will undoubtably be cheaper, but it is very neat now and I am glad I decided not to wait. The book download process is a breeze--and I have found a wide variety of interesting books to choose from. Amazon also has a link to request a kindle edition of books that do not now have them--I hope the publishers will listen to the requests. I have old eyes and I read a lot, so the ability to increase the text size is a real plus for me. I wish it had a light--but I am sure that would be a real battery drain and I plan to buy a booklight for it soon. I really am enjoying this product and am having trouble making myself carry around the books I had already bought in hard copy! I will be buying as many as possible in this format from now on."
5,kindle review,"I was considering the iPhone if I found that it could play ebooks, videos and music files. I asked a guy in the mall if his iPhone (noticed he was using one) would do those things; he said he did not know but that his father had a Kindle and loved it. This was after I had just been treated badly (ignored, rebuffed) in a Sony store in which I was going to look at a Sony reader. Would probably have bought it if they had been helpful. Ended up, fortunately, researching the Kindle and bought one. Like the guy's father, I really like. Would like to see you experiment with video and improve the web search function, even at a monthly fee to connect with the internet, if it was fully functional like the iPhone. Thanks, Cecil"
3,lets talk bare bones,"I have enjoyed my Kindle very much, however, there are a couple three things I feel would improve it's user friendliness. First, the page turn bars are too easy to accidently hit. This can happen in any number of ways of which I frequently experience...and because of their positions holding the Kindle is a challenge. Second, it would be a really nice addition to put some kind of back lighting in the machine so one could read in the dark, this is a suggestion from my husband...one last thing, I haven't had my kindle long but I cannot figure out the ""page number"" system you have. Oh, and the holder cover you send with it does not grasp the Kindle well, mine keeps slipping off , it's a pain. The thing I LOVE the best is the dictionary, it is so great being able to get the definition of words immediately. When I purchase the next version I will be looking for these types of improvements. Thanks for the Kindle!! VJW"
3,need some variety now,When are the second generation Kindles going to come out? I want to purchase them as gift for my siblings but they are so picky about color. Putting in my request for a hot pink one!!!
4,I Love My Kindle,"My husband bought my kindle when Oprah had it on her show, to me it's great I can carry it where I go don't have to worry about holding my page, or constantly running to the book store to buy my favorite book. The only problem I have with my Kindle is the page bars they need to be smaller to give you a place to hold the book without changing the pages. I have learned how to hold it without turning the pages,It isn't very comfortable for long periods of time.If they can fix that it would be perfect for me!"
4,Kindle is Cool!,Bought it for my Husband and he loves it. Only thing I wish is that it could be used in the dark.
4,gina's 2008 K,I really really Love my Kindle. However I keep turning the page by mistake? Thank you so much for this invention!GMM
4,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"I really like the Kindle, however, I have a problem getting the music function to work. Contacted customer service with an e-mail and got no more info than I found in the manual. I find it very easy to use and the content available is very good. I will try calling customer service to resolve the music player issue."
3,Kindle -- Good but could be better,"The concept is great but there are several things that could be improved.1. the next page buttons are very annoying as they are where your fingers naturally fall so any wrong move will turn the page. VERY VERY ANNOYING.2. The software could be a lot better. For example to delete an item, you have to go through several menues and when it asks for a confirmation of the deletion, it doesn't give a list of what is going to be deleted, only the number of items.3. The leather cover could be designed better: the kndle keeps coming out or it.4. On the BIG PLUS side, I download articles and editorials from the NY Times, etc. every day and don;t have time to read them at work so I read them on the subway on may way home and airplane flights ....awesome.Even with all the annoying negatives, I would't give it up."
4,Portable books,The kindle meets my expectations. I like the ability to store several books when I travel. It's very easy to read. My preference would be to have the instructions re use also in hard copy for easier reference.
4,Kindle Review,"My new favorite thing! I will NEVER be without something to read. Between my Kindle and my Ipod, my digital life is complete"
4,Very good e-book,"I like everything about the e-book, BUT...I live in an area that does not receive Sprint Whisper Net and I have to take the book into town (76 miles round trip) in order to download new books. It's not really too bad as I go to this town about once a week and can download all my purchased books at one time. For some reason I can't download them from my computer. Otherwise I love the e-book and the fact that so many books are available for a very reasonable purchase price."
4,A humble suggestion,"For all of you discussing the good, the bad and the ugly of this product here in the review section without actually having seen or used one (and yes, I count myself among you) why don't you use the discussion forum? That way people interested in actual reviews from people who have actually used the device won't have to sift though hundreds of entries from people who have no more actual experience or information to share than what can be learned from reading the product description."
4,A Boon for the Sight Impaired,"My 100 year old mother doesn't see as well as she used to, but she took to the Kindle like a duck to water. The print enlargement feature is what did it.I had bought the Kindle for myself, and I demonstrated it to my mother expecting her to find it difficult to manage; we were both very pleasantly surprised.Now I have to buy my own Kindle."
5,Love my Kindle!,"I've had my Kindle for over 2 months now and am absolutely thrilled with it.Before I ordered I was skeptical about reading off a gadget, but I've never once felt that the gadget has gotten between me and my reading. In fact, I find it much easier to read off the Kindle than the printed page. I read faster and more often than I ever had before.There's not much more to say that hasn't been said already in 3,175 previous reviews. I mainly wanted to put my 2 cents in and let my 5-star review offset the many 1-star reviews written by people who don't even own a Kindle."
2,Slick unit - but I wouldn't pay this price for it.,"I was one of the test users. It's pretty slick and mostly easy to use - much of the usability feedback was pretty nit-picky. I also suspect that if I'd had a manual I could have figured out some of the questions I had about navigation, but I think that was part of the testing - to see how well we could use it without direction.That said ... $400 is not a price point that interests me at all. I would pay half that perhaps, but only if I could also read things in different formats; I purchase frequently from Amazon but I also use my public library heavily. The inability to get ebooks from other sources would make this product considerably less attractive to me, particularly at a $400 price point.I have had jobs before where I traveled extensively for work and I could see this being a much more attractive product for someone with that type of lifestyle."
3,Good reader,"Yes it is a bit pricey but It is a pleasure to use. Easy to read and operate. I have read ebooks on my Palm Pilot for a number of years and was not planning on purchasing a Kindle because of the price and because I could not share the ebook with others. I enjoy books and have easy access to libraries. News papers are all available for free on line. What you are paying for is convenience. There is no reason to have a device that holds 100 books as I never read 100 books at once. But if you read a number of different books at a time a Kindle lightens your load, especially while traveling. What would make this an ideal unit would be if the price would drop about $150 and if you were able to give the books to others with Kindles to read. Most of us buy a book and after we read it give it to someone else to read. We should be able to do that with a Kindle and there should be a way we can do that and make the file active on only one unit at a time."
2,Not for me,"I think that this is a very good idea, but it's not for me. I read in a little known genre called Christian Fantasy. I looked up all the big names, but not one was in there. If you could ask for them to put books on there that they don't have and they would do it, this would be something I would be interested in. But at $400 and not really any books I want this item is not for me."
1,Kindle does not work In Montana,"I bought a Kindle with high hopes. I live in Missoula, Montana, which is one of the largest cities in the state. It turns out that the wireless connectivity that the Kindle requires does NOT work in Montana. After several tech support calls they admitted that there is no coverage in Montana. There may also be no coverage in other states, such as Wyoming and Alaska. This means that the Service component of the device is useless, and that many, many people may be duped. I think this is bait and switch advertising, and I think Amazon owes people in Montana, as well as other non-coverage areas, an apology."
2,Looking forward to the second version.,Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading DeviceThis is an ugly unit. Very Eastern European retro hideous.Love the concept and the features. Like the cost savings on purchase of reading matter and am excited at the future opportunities for learning and entertainment. Its appearance is repugnant and an affront to anyone who considers design and aesthetics an important part of their life journey. Roll out Kindle Mark II.Cheers...Mike
3,Questions!,"I want one of these and almost purchased the Sony version, before I knew of this product, which looks much better. What stopped me from getting the Sony was the lack of book titles.I enjoy Science Fiction, philosophy, quirky novels, and stuff off the general beaten path. The Sony model seemed to have books which I call ""drug store"" or ""airport"" kind of books. Those are for people who don't love reading in my opinion, but let's not argue that point.I'd like to reduce the number of physical books which I collect, but I want to be able to have the kind of subject matter which I enjoy. So, what are the plans for working with a wide range of publishers?I looked at the Amazon Ebook section and saw none of my favorite authors.This isn't so much a review as a request for feedback."
5,It can change your life,I'm still learning what the kindle can do but I'm very impressed. I tried a blog on the kindle. Boing Boing. It's Great; much more news than CNN and much more fun. Thanks Amazon for the kindle. Oh yes and for telephone support that works
1,way too pricey,"If amazon really wants to push this thing.. the price must come down. The tech inside is a few years old, on black is less than full color LCD and how big is the hardrive? No wifi? No bluetooth? The cost to produce can not be close to a full service PDA or smartphone. Get it down to $150 and I'm in. Not a minute before then.."
1,Another poor introduction and half-baked product of a cool concept,"This, and the Sony Reader, remind me of the Palm Audrey that was introduced about 6 years ago. It has a great premise to begin with, portable reading of books on a device smaller than a laptop but bigger than a Palm. However, it's not in color which is useful when reading technical books on a device like this or articles in the papers. I like graphs in color. Buy the next version that comes out. Forget this one. In this day, with tech savvy buyers that have been burned by idiot tech marketers before, I can't understand why a product like this would be only half-baked? It hurts what could have a been a great launch of a technology on either the Amazon Kindle or the Sony Reader."
2,Why not get a Nokia n800?????????? Or even an iPhone??????????,"I have no idea why someone would try to invent a lousier wheel, let alone an expensive gimmick like this. First of all, book idea or not, you can get something like an iPhone or (better yet, as I have an n800 and LOVE it) a Nokia n800 for roughly half as much??? All the hard work in making a truly portable 'internet tablet' has already been done, and the n800 is a full computer with wifi and bluetooth... it can watch youtube videos, view pdfs, view webpages as normal... why oh why would anyone drop over twice as much for something clunky and fairly useless for most other tasks??? Maybe they don't see all the Apple commercials about how people DON'T WANT TO CARRY MORE ELECTRONICS AROUND, and how they want SMALLER DEVICES..But hey what do I know about reality???"
2,What! No PDF?!,"NO PDF = No purchase. No way I will buy one of these things, unless it were a $10 purchase, without PDF support. I'm sure that leaving out PDF support was no accident! There are thousands upon thousands of FREE PDF books available, and I have been waiting for a product like this to come along so I could perhaps download and read some of them, without using up a lot of paper and ink, needlessly.If it weren't for the fact that a lot of people who don't mind throwing away a lot of money to download PAY PER READ ebooks will probably get some use out of it, I would have rated it ONE STAR.'Tis a shame, I say!Come on, Amazon - get it together - PLEASE!I won't be buying it without PDF support - EVER!"
3,Design flaw,"I am a fairly new owner of the Kindle. The only complaint I have so far is that, in my opinion, it has a design flaw. The page turners on each side are way too sensitive or poorly located. I find myself touching one or the other and loosing my place in what I'm reading. It's very irritating."
4,Paging kinetics,"I agree with the comments about the page turning controls. There is no need for both sides of the Kindle to be taken up in their entirety. There is no convenient way to grasp or pick it up without risking turning a page inadvertently; otherwise, I love it!"
2,Watching a movie,"If I've already downloaded a movie onto my fire, why do I have to have wi fi to watch the movie if the wi fi is turned on? The whole reason you download a movie to the device is so you can watch it when you don't have service! It's ridiculous that I have to turn off the wi fi to watch a movie that's already on the device when I have a weak or no wi fi signal."
2,"Faulty Advertising, Defective Product","1. Jeff Bezos told Charlie Rose on Rose's TV show that one could download books ""anywhere."" Not true. The area in which one can download are limited pretty much to the populated areas. We wanted to use the Kindle in our RV and while travelling to Nicaragua. We thought we could use it wherever there is cell phone service. Wrong.2. We downloaded one book and the Kindle froze on one particular page. It is of no use to us now, and while in Nicaragua, there were no current books in English available. We will be returning it when we get home."
1,bad marketing,"A device that costs 400$ and adds a new e-book format to the already packed with formats e-book cyberspace without supporting the previous formats eg pdf and lit (to which many have invested time and money) is simply a waste of money and bad marketing. I would rather buy for the same money two of the ""100$ laptop"" by MIT and send one of them to a kid in a developing country that needs to enter the information age as well"
2,A suggestion,"I just finished watching Charlie Rose's program on channel 13 with Jeff Bezos. Kindle is a good idea. However, I feel it has many features in common with ipods and as such, if feasible, the additional features of Kindle may be combined with ipods so that the book lovers would carry just only one device instead of the two. As I understand, Kindle lacks audio capability, and with my suggestion this shortcoming will also be overcome.Moe"
1,Abysmal Implementation of a Much Needed Device,"This is exactly the kind of lightweight, portable device that's needed to bring e-books into the mainstream, but gets everything WRONG on pricing, content, software, end-user rights... Maybe the worst part is, when this bastard child of vendor/publisher greed goes deservedly belly-up, it will ""prove"" that there is no market for such a device- when the TRAGIC FLAW is in the IMPLEMENTATION. So disappointing- a huge false step for Amazon."
1,What a failure?!,"This must be a joke!A horrendously ugly reader, overpriced, that requires charging every other day (batteries will start losing charging capacity, so it's going to need an every day charge). Haha..I hope they didn't bet a lot on this one."
3,Any hidden monthly Amazon fees?,"If this device uses a cellular network (instead of wifi), who pays the monthly access charges?"
3,Version 1 - No Thanks,400 bucks! No color! No browser! No Video! No Thanks!Gald to see Amazon getting behind a book reader but until the above is addressed - I'll wait.
3,Sold Out,"Great, I'm willing to impulsively take the plunge by letting my daughter 'beta' the thing for me, by getter her one for X-mas. Amazon is out and won't have any by then. Nothing is more of a 'buzz' killer (for an 'installed base' marketing model) than being not able to supply potenially interested buyers during a rollout. Way to shoot yourself in the foot Amazon..."
1,Unsatisfied,"As patron services director of a regional library for the blind, this device would have been so ideal for our patrons for books not done by the Library of Congress. However, leaving out an audio screen reader, leaves out a great portion of the population unable to read normal print due to visual impairment, blindness, physical disability, and for some with reading disabilities. Thinking only ""one-sighted"" in new technology in this way is not, in the least, something to shout about as being forward-moving."
4,Kindle,"I love my Kindle. I'm a teacher and had great plans for closet cleaning this summer. Nope, not gonna happen. I'm hooked. Yes, it has a few minor things that are a little hinky, but I'm used to them now. I'm a little disappointed that the new Janet Evanovich book isn't available."
4,Kindle Review,"I have had the Kindle for about a month. I enjoy the readability and the range of available books. It's a little expensive, but for me, worth it."
1,Beware - No satisfaction,"I own a first generation Kindle. It has had very little use but recently the screen froze. After replacing the battery, trying the reset, the company informs me that it can't be fixed. They have no service center of any sort that can repair this for me. After a lengthy and frustrating conversation with their help line they offered me for the mere charge of $99, another ""refurbished"" kindle with a three month warranty. Are you kidding me? The supervisor actually said to me ""I can't guarantee it will work for a day or a month"". Are you kidding me? He quickly replied that they would replace it within the three month period. NO THANK YOU. I am on my way to look at Sony and IPAD. Hope to see you there."
1,No DRM support for Mobipocket eBooks!,"My title says it all,... since I have a big collection of purchased, DRM'd, Mobipocket books, I will only buy an eBook reader (to replace my Palm LifeDrive) that supports these files. I think it is downright snarky that Amazon owns Mobipocket and will NOT allow them to write a Mobipocket driver that will read my existing eBooks on either the Kindle or on Apple's iPhone. Therefore, I boycott Kindle and will never buy an eBook file from Amazon."
2,it breaks with incredible ease,"the product is generally good but INCREDIBLY fragile. mine fell from a coffee table (with the cover ON) and the screen became illegible.i am upset because i bought mine less than 2 months ago!!Amazons policy is to charge you $180 to send you a ""referbished one""."
4,Amazing Device,"I admit I wasn't sold on the idea of an eBook. I like to hold a book in my hands, turn the pages, yada yada yada. Same as most of the other reviewers. I was wrong -- I am totally sold on the Kindle. (In fact, I've sold at least 4 of them to friends -- where's my commission, Amazon?) The mix of a lightweight device, wireless access and instant book delivery is amazing. Only one small complaint -- you need to be able to toggle between the ePaper (great for reading) and a backlit version. The only thing that keeps this device from being 5 stars is that you can't read it in the dark."
4,Kindle,"The Kindle beat my expectations - it is really easy to read the text and the purchasing process is simple.however, the ability to use the kindle overseas should be improved. the best features of the kindle, such as the ability to sample a book, are not available outside of the u.S., which is frustrating.also, a reading light would be very helpful, as the gray page is hard to read in dim light."
3,Lots of Good Stuff But My Hands Are Killing Me,"Love the ability to order a book and have it immediately available. The wireless service has been great, no problems at all. Battery life is good. And I find it very intuitive. I am a big fan except....I read a lot, for long stretches at a time, and I've had to put my kindle away for a while. My hands developed painful cramps. I actually booked a hand massage to try and work out some of the kinks. I've never had problems with my hands before, but the Kindle hasn't been kind to them.That's my biggest grievance and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to overcome it.My other gripes are smaller: I wish the screen could be lit. I wish you could delete a sample chapter without having to go to a separate area. I wish you could put books in folders and/or tag them. In the Kindle Store, I wish you could access ""what's new"" by category of books. I use this a lot on the website and miss it on the Kindle."
2,out of stock?? -50 points.,"I ordered a Kindle. Now I wait, and wait, and wait some more. Why is a highly hyped item allowed to be out of stock without even so much as an estimated ship date? Part of the charm of a Kindle is not having to wait for a book to be delivered. So to have to wait to even be told when the Kindle will be delivered is utterly maddening."
4,Great Reading Device,"I am very pleased with my purchase. I have recommended the Kindle to my family members, friends, and co-workers. If you you are avid reader, you will love the device because you have 24/7 access to a wide array of books. It is a little pricey but I believe it pays for itself. If you read like I do, I was spending at least $150.00 per month on books. Now my dollars are going further. Thank-you Amazon!"
4,Opinion on Kindle,"I love the Kindle. Could it be improved - yes, but overall it's fantastic. What I think should be changed is a case a little larger so that you're finger doesn't accidently hit the page forward or page backward button. Also, I'm really not too happy regarding the audio set up. You have to buy the books from Audible and if you have audiobooks already, they cannot be uploaded. If and when they can be, there is no way to create folders so that the audio plays in sequence instead of random. The price point on the books could be a little lower since there is no way to move the data from the Kindle to another unit. Also a back light would be nice. If you plan to purchase a Kindle - do so without hesitation."
5,Thee Universal Book: a must have!,"The Kindle seems to me the next revolution since Gutenberg: not only from paper to e-paper, but in combination with the internet, you get an electronic library at Amazon.com and access to any book you want to buy from essentially any place. And, you can ask wiki and google anytime you want :) In my opinion it's a must have for each and every member of the family!"
5,Kindle Review,"I am really enjoying my new Kindle. I can't wait for the link to the Gutenberg Project to be fully functional since I have been enjoying classic books that I haven't read in years.Since receiving my Kindle in July I have read dozens of books. I love it. I am a voracious reader and love that purchasing a new book is so convenient and inexpensive. I love the part that you can download samples of books before purchasing the entire book. It has also helped to keep my bookshelves less crowded and has made travel easier.When I had an issue with my Kindle (the screen started doing some weird stuff). After calling Kindle support, I had a new Kindle in 5 days and a label to return my broken Kindle - no charge. I can't be happier with the service that I have received from Amazon, from new purchases to support for past purchases."
4,kindle power,"the kindle works great. EXCEPT: if you live in a rural area like i do, you may have trouble connecting. i receive no signal at my house so i have to go somewhere else to download. it is a pain on weekends when i do not have to go to work. keep that in mind."
4,Kindling along...,"I finally got my Kindle from Amazon last month. After a wait of about 45 days (since placing the order) it was exciting to take a look at one of the latest gadgets.I like the device - strong points are:1. Easy to read - very close to a book feeling2. Fast download of books from amazon.com3. Highlight and Note features are great4. The best one - you can download a sample chapter of each available book before you buy it.Downside:1. Black and White Screen - No color2. Only over 100,000 books available in ebook format3. Most of the good ones are expensive - about $9.994. Hey - and I cant show of the books I buy in my bookshelf!I tried a few sample book and bought my first one - 'Your Inner fish: A Journey into the 3.5 billion-year history of the Human Body' by Neil Shubin.More on that later..."
4,New Kindle Owner,"We watched the online demo of the Kindle at work. Within a day I ordered mine. I have read e-books before using a Palm Pilot. This is much better. A completly different experience. I like to read and thought that I would stick with the book in my hand, the smell of the paper, the sound of the pages as they turned. I still like that but the Kindle is what I have been looking for. I like the features and the ease of purchasing books. I am looking forward to the day when I can check out books from the library with it. The one thing that I don't like is the placement of the page turning buttons. I would prefer it if one side or the other could be turned off. I read with my hands holding a book on the side and getting used to holding the Kindle at the bottom is awkward. I turn pages when I am not meaning too. Other than that, and that is really a behavioral change, I think that I will love my new toy."
4,love it,"My Kindle attracts attention wherever I have it. It is small and easy to carry. I find that books pile up at home, and I end up donating them or saving them in a closet or bookcase. And now I enjoy having a 1000+ page book on the Kindle. I would like to see more products available in the Kindle format. I especially wanted travel books. I am planning a trip to England and France this spring and wanted to take travel books on the Kindle to save room and weight for airlines. Also, the side bars to change pages are too easily touched by accident. everyone who holds my Kindle changes pages unintentionally. And my Kindle does not stay in the folder--it falls out, even when I put it in there correctly. I will have to use a strip of velcro to keep it from falling out. I think these things will improve with the next version. What a great idea this was !!"
4,Everything I hoped it would be!,"I have had my Kindle 3 weeks now and I totally love it! It is everything I hoped for. I initially saw it on Oprah and though I do usually like her suggestions, I did a lot of homework before purchasing it. I'm sure glad that I did. Love the feature of being able to preview a book before purchasing and also the ability to access the dictionary mid-reading to look up a meaning. Enjoyed the 2-week free trial of the New York Times also. The only change I would make would be to put the on/off button on the front instead of the back because sometimes I inadvertently press ""next page"" when I am taking it out of the cover to turn off. Other than that - I'm happy!"
2,Kendel,A great idea---a reading device. The side tabs were too long for page turning on both sides. That did not leave enough room to hold the kendel like you would a book without turning pages. The book cover was not very good quality or comfortable to handle. Nothing made in USA as well. I decided to wait for the refinements of this new product and until there were more book choices. I looked for several and none of them were available. Keep on creating!
3,I like it but you can't get all books,I like the Kindle but I was not aware that you could not get any book you want. I saw the Kindle on the Oprah show just like I saw David Foster telling us about his new book on her show. David Foster's book is not available on the Kindle. This was the first book I wanted. So I am very disappointed.I believe Amazon should be very clear that there are many books that are not available for the Kindle.
2,my kindle in Montana,"I love the kindle, but I had no Idea why I couldn't get any service or bars when I bought it. I had to do quite a bit of research to discover that my Kindle is supported by Sprint and Montana has no Sprint service.Once I learned how to download books to my computer then to my kindle, I can read a book but that is all I can do with the device. I wish I would have been aware of this before I bought it."
2,Disappointed,"I find the kindle difficult to manipulate through the menu and hard to understand. I have viewed your online videos but that, along with the instructions, do not explain clearly how to properly use the kindle to its full potential. I also was not reimbursed the full amount for a second kindle that I ordered by mistake."
1,"Good idea, crappy implementation","The price for the device and the books is terrible high. The hardware is proprietary and if your device is lost or damaged, you lose your library. The adoption rate of this product will be low because of those factors. Amazon will have to significantly lower the price. Wait a few months before purchasing."
4,SHOULD HAVE AAA BATTERY OPTION,"SIMPLE. SHOULD HAVE NORMAL BATTERY OPTION IF YOU'RE STRANDED. CELL AND CORDLESS PHONES LACK THIS WISE FEATURE AS WELL. IS EVERYONE JUST DUMB? LIKE WEEKEND ELECTIONS, IT'S A NO BRAINER IMPROVEMENT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. WEIRD. AMAZON...ADD A PLACE FOR A BATTERY.HOW DOESN'T THAT MAKE PERFECT SENSE?JEFF. HOW COULD YOU MISS THIS?AND WHY CAN'T I TRANSFER MY EXCERPS AND COMMENTS TO ANOTHER COMPUTER SO I CAN HAVE FAIR USE FOR MY OWN WRITING, SHARING WITH FRIENDS ETC. OPEN THAT OPTION UP FOR STUDENTS, WRITERS, TEACHERS. DO A LOT OF GOOD, AND COSTS NOTHING. AGAIN, HOW DOESNT THAT MAKE PERFECT SENSE?"
1,Frozen,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I have learned to deal with the poorly placed buttons and was very exicted to download my first books. I read the first one, no problem. In the middle of the second, the screen froze. No amount of pushing the reset button or fiddling with the Alt aA buttons will unfreeze the screen. I removed the battery. As it sits on one side and the Kindle on the other, the screen is still lit and frozen, although in the Off position. My sister's terrific Christmas present to me is worthless. Oh well, I can go to my computer and finish reading the book at least. But no, I am unable to open the file. What a ripoff this entire thing is. I hope my sister can get her money back."
2,Lack of Content,"I really like this reader, I don't regret buying it, and I think the concept is simply wonderful. However, I have found 3 books I wanted to read (love the free chapter feature)and I would have purchased about 15 others except they are not available for Kindle.The device is 5 stars, the service is 5 stars, but there simply aren't enough titles available. It is a huge dissapointment to me, and why I rate Kindle with only 2 stars."
1,Screen is FRAGILE and still too few titles,"I've had my Kindle since July 2008 and it's January 2009. I haven't used it as much as I thought I would due to a lack of good material. I haven't traveled with it much for the same reason. Good thing. Here I am on holiday in a foreign country and the display cracked while in my luggage. Don't believe the picture in the product listing showing it being put bare into a back pack or surviving a drop. Kindle's screen is very fragile and if not well protected will crack with slight pressure. Mine didn't get any hard knocks and still cracked. I think this is a nice product idea but not nice enough to justify the price, nor is it robust enough. I really don't care if it is as heavy as a book, as long as it's just as tough. It should be able to be dropped from several feet, should have a built in cover if the display needs protection, and it should use the usb port for charging, not require a different charger."
3,The Cost For This Gadget is just SILLY...,"I definately would not shell out this type of money for this gadget. Sure it looks interesting enough. You may be getting a discount price on the book 9.99, but you've already paid the difference when you purchased the gadget. I personally wouldn't have any use for it. I purchase books from Amazon, but I also purchase books from other stores. Then there are the discounted books. Most of these hard cover books you can get at a lower than the 9.99 it will cost you at Amazon. I would rather wait a bit and save my money which will in turn allow me to purchase more books! And what about the get 4 for 3 sales?There's just so much more one can do with the money."
1,"Useless outside of the U.S., not open","""Unlike WiFi, Kindle utilizes the same high-speed data network (EVDO) as advanced cell phones--so you never have to locate a hotspot.""Yeah, right. You forget that EVDO is mostly a U.S.-only technology.Until Amazon works out a GSM (GPRS/EDGE) version, it's useless outside of the U.S., for instance, down in South America where GSM is the norm.Second, until Amazon opens it up to other ebook formats, I won't even touch it with a 10ft pole. I already have purchased content in Audible, eReader, Mobipocket and PDF. I want an ebook reader which can read it all, rather than restrict me (PDF, HTML, TXT, eReader, Mobipocket).Try again, Amazon..."
3,"GREAT concept. OK product. AMZN design team, talk to Apple Inc","This is the kind of product I have been looking for; Wireless access to blogs, magazines, books and texts. Almost a dream come true. But...If book reading were to be replaced, it must have a MUCH simpler interface:- maximize reading surface area (maybe eliminate keyboard with a touchscreen keyboard)- optimize interface for reading (NOT Buying - buying will come if reading takes on, imho). While I read, I flip pages, bookmark, write on them.... Given it is electronic, i might want to ""search"" for words, ""go to"" table of contents or a particular chapter. A simple interface for this should be possible.- A minimal ""interface"" with an attached e-pen perhaps?I am sure this concept combined with some folks who think and design like apple can crack this one. I hope they do. I really think this is the future. Paperless.Cost coming down from $400 would help as well."
3,Really Exciting & Useful Technology!,"I'll be back to buy when there is more content available (of all types) and the prices on everything (including the device) have come down significantly. I know you're trying not to cannibalize your own book sales by keeping the prices fairly high on kindle content, but you can't have your cake and eat it too. You're either going to change the world by transforming the way people read and by helping to increase literacy around the world (therefore creating a larger market)....or somebody else (like Apple) will do it.Keep up the good work, Amazon!"
1,Closed product,"Nice direction. I need such a device, but...Where are:1) open SDK2) file format specifications3) support for pdf and djvu + easy connectivity from Linux boxWhy buy Kindle when Chinese Jinke provides all this for a fraction of the price?"
1,Little use outside of the U.S. - I will wait for a GSM version,"This device seems to be all about vendor lock-in. First the DRM in ebooks... that's awful. Amazon made history by going DRM-free in music with its MP3 store and now they stick DRM to ebooks?.Second, the issue of EV-DO... they should have imitated the iPhone and gone GSM. The World+Dog has gone GSM, with the only exception of the U.S.In short: they should release a GSM version, make it DRM-free, make it able to read PDF files and other popular eBook formats (like eReader)."
3,Overseas Usage for Military Personnel??? (I don't own one yet).,"I am in the military and will be shipping out for 6 months or so where there might not be wifi connections and stuff like that, and I want to get a Kindle, but not sure if it will work out. I know that it doesn't work off of Wifi, but I am kind of hesitent about getting one. This would be perfect for the down time that we will have over there. Anyone have any similar experience that they can share?"
2,"Rather have a regular book, but I see its uses","I think I would rather have a book to be able to flip through which I like to do when I'm reading. I like to know the words are printed and won't disappear, or get erased. I also like to be able to lay down with a nice paperback that is not hard plastic. But I do see the benefit for some people who travel alot and like to read the paper or magazines. It is probably good for the environment/trees, and to save paper. It has its uses, but I just hope that it doesn't replace good old fashioned books."
4,Amazing Little Machine,"I was an avid reader at one time. My youngest daughter asked me one day if I knew what a Kindle was. I didn't, so she described it, and told me to look at it on Amazon.com. I did, I bought, and the rest is history! I've read 2 books in 1 week!It is very user friendly. However, the on off button is an awkward place at the back of the Kindle, and the next page bar would be better a little smaller. However, all in all, I absolutely LOVE the Kindle. So much so that I purchased another Kindle for my oldest daughter for her 31 birthday. I've told anyone who'll listen about The amazing little machine!"
4,Props to Amazon,"simply for allowing any all all reviews, positive or negative, of their new product (including people who have never seen or used one).Typical class act from Amazon.Yeah, I wish it were cheaper, but I'm giving it a shot."
2,Prefer a paperback,"I got a Kindle for Christmas. I enjoy and like to have electronic gadgets, so I thought I would like the Kindle. I tried it for a few days over the holiday time off. The screen is very good and easy to read, just like a regular book. It has lots of neat features, marking/saving quotes in a book, searching, and the on-line access worked very well. It worked anywhere in my home, places our cell phones did not work. Down loading was very fast. I found I missed having a book, and the handling of the Kindle was awkward for me. I kept accidentally hitting the page forward/back buttons, there was little room to hold it. It is a little bigger than most paperbacks, it does not fit into your pocket easily. Most Kindle book prices are $9.99, compared to buying paperbacks, that is little high. It uses an electronic format that is not compatible with other electronic formats, so you can not use most other electronic formats. We sent it back, after a little hassle we got a full refund."
5,Great Product for Readers,"I love the Kindle!! What can I say? I haven't enjoyed reading so much until I got this product. Its all good. The only con: Kindle book selection is still quite limited. I am missing books from my favorite authors. On a side note, for those who complain about accidentally pressing the ""Next Page"" button, I haven't had this problem because I keep the Kindle in its cover and I just hold onto the edges of the cover.In summary, I am very thrilled with this latest in technology. It is truly an excellent product for readers of all ages."
2,"bulky, flimsy construction","I've owned a Sony Reader since they first went on sale as well. Being able to buy books on Amazon.com is a huge win even if the content library is still too small. Wireless delivery makes using the device much easier, no desktop syncing software required.My primary complaint is that the device is incredibly flimsy and too big. I far prefer the form-factor of the Sony Reader, which is both sturdy and compact. The Kindle's big flimsy next-page button got a plastic strip ripped off it the second time I threw it in my carry-on laptop bag, despite being in the book cover. I repeat, the _second_ time. The sony reader has weathered many many airplane trips in that same bag without hardly a scratch -- and it takes up less space to boot. Amazon seriously needs to revisit the physical design of this device to make it more durable and more compact."
2,"Wait until it supports illustrations, maps, charts, indexes, etc.","Physically this device is very impressive; it is easy to hold, the screen is clear, you can change the font size and what is most surprising, you can navigate around the book.However, the lack of illustrations, etc. is a major disappointment. This eliminates my favorite type of book: non fiction.The ability and pleasure of passing a book along to a friend is also eliminated. Probably I'll use it mainly for the literary classics."
3,Non-US customers should think twice about buying this,"Don't get me wrong - the Kindle is a great device for reading electronic texts. It's just that if you don't have a credit or debit cart issued by a U.S. bank you will not be able to use the Kindle Store to buy and download anything - instead you are stuck with other sources of electronic texts which you have to port over (I recommend the Project Gutenberg website - Google for it!).I am currently living in the United States, but have a German credit card - and I only discovered this after I had already bought it. Since this little factoid is mentioned nowhere on the product page (at least as far as I could see), I am forced to give Kindle only 3 out of 5 stars - essentially, this was a blatant withholding of vital information to a small, but significant minority of customers.If I had known what I was getting into, I would have given it five stars. So if you are a U.S. citizen, by all means go ahead and buy it."
1,Keeps freezing up,"Everytime I used the Kindle it would freeze up after about a minute of use. I had to keep resetting it per customer service recommendations. I charged it fully, but it still kept freezing up. I am returning it for a refund. I was really excited about the concept and am really disappointed that it was not functioning properly. Maybe the one I received was defective."
4,Kindle is Great!,"I owned Kindle for a little over a month, and I like it. It is great. The only thing I don't like about Kindle is the design of the Next Page button. It is easy to hit this button, and thus causes the page to turn unintentionally. Amazon should redesign it so that the button should be smaller and not easily accessible to accidental touch or hit.Also, the case for kindle is also poorly designed. The cover case for Kindle doesn't hold kindle very well. Kindle can easily slip out of the case without the user's intention to do so.If Amazon can fix this poor designs, Kindle is a perfect electronic reading book to have.Sang"
5,I am KINDLE-d!,Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading DeviceThis is an incredible product for a very reasonable price. I am excited about more books being available for the device.It is worth every penny!
1,Usability is Dismal,Luckily i didn't pay for one of these. I used one of my friends and being a software engineer I figured I would be able to figure it out... no such luck. I spend 15 minutes trying to use some of the most basic functions (read) without success. I'm sure if you study the manual it is probably useable but it still has a long way to go before it will be able to replace the usability of a book. Aside from the usability issues the display refresh is appallingly slow i couldn't imagine the suspense waiting to see the next page of the book. I do have to admit once the display refresh it is beautifully easy to read. This isn't going to replace a book for me any time soon even though I'm a tech junky.
1,But can I get this in Alaska?,"I can get AT&T; service in the little town of Klawock. I can get AT&T; service in the little town of Hydaburg. Can I get a Kindle, avoid 10-day shipping waits and surcharges for shipping books to Alaska? Avoid having to give all my books away if I'm posted to another small town $500 planefare and one carry-on away?Nope.This is really frustrating."
1,No PDF is a JOKE!!,"Kindle apparently displays attachments, that is if you don't want to view 50% of that attachments out there. Does NOT view PDFs and most attachments are PDFs. Viewing attachments is a JOKE without PDFs. You can not open PDFs, beware if you are buying it for that reason."
1,Completely unnecessary,"Not only is this thing completely HIDEOUS, who would pay this much to carry around books? It takes days/weeks to read books - cannot compare to carrying around a music collection. Awful idea, awful execution."
5,TED'S KINDLE REVIEW,"Reviewed this product extensively (&competition;)before purchasing.Far superior, even though a little more expensive, with wireless connectionsfor free;sample books;&extensive; magazines & newspapers.Kindle: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device"
1,There's no way to organize the material!,"I intended to use my Kindle as a convenient way to accessand read more than a hundred different journal articles in several major subject areas. While I was uploading the material, and Kindle appeared on my computer desktop, I carefully created different folders and subfolders to organize the content for easy access. But when I tried to read my uploads, I soon discovered that the Kindle unit itself doesn't recognize or show any folders at all! As a result, all the many different documents ended up lumped together in one overly long and totally disorganized list. That's VERY unsatisfactory and negates any value the unit would have for uses other than reading one book at a time."
1,item not shipped at all when company says they do,item was confermed my money taken and then a message weeks later we do have in stock thanks for wasting my time and screwing up my credit card
3,You should get the GZMG255,"I started with the GZMG130, but the still camera is worthless and the resolution is 640x480. The 255 has 2.0 Megapixel and a flash and firewire built in. Just plug it in and iMovie imports the clips right in. Plug into USB and iPhoto opens right up."
4,Great Camera,"I'm very pleased with this camera. The only drawback is the use of a proprietary file format for the videos it produces (*.MOD), although it appears the files can be renamed to .MPG so that Media Player and other software recognize the files. Other than that video quality and ease of use is great."
2,"So far so good, but software sucks","If you buy this video camera , you have to add another 100 bucks to buy a software for making DVD, otherwise you would be turned out like my situation: take quite many hours of video but no solution to transfer to DVD. The attached software has bug, I tried several times to make movie, it just wasted my DVDs."
1,Can't get it to work with iMovie,"The saleman at BestBuy assured me that the camera was compatible with iMovie software on our Mac computer, but my experience, and what I have read since on the web tells me that is simply not true. I will probably return the camera. Bummer."
4,Do Your Homework!,"The GZMG130 is a great camcorder.Unfortunately it's incompatible with MAC / iMovie.There is third party software available for the MAC which is painful to use.Do your homework; The GZMG255 is a few bucks more, has FireWire, delivers mega pixel movies and a better choice for MAC / iMovie users.It would be nice if JVC and/or Apple would ""step up to the plate"" and address the issue."
3,"good price, bad static photo","It is good price, and the movie is ok.But the photo it takes is too bad.I can't believe that the photo it takes is worse then I take by my cell phone!"
3,Not what I expected,"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing a video camera. My final decision was between the jvc everio and the sony handycam. After reading reviews and consider the price, we decided on the jvc. I am disappointed in the video quality during playback on our computer. The video looks great on the small display window on the camera so it was quite a shock to upload the videos and see how grainy it looked. We even switched the mode to record in the highest image quality and I am still not impressed.The camera is easy to use and very small. It is useless for still photos but that is why we have a digital camera. We haven't had any issues with the battery either. We bought an extra just in case but havne't had to use it yet.Pros: small, easy to use, easy to playback and delete on cameracons: video quality not the best, still photos are horrible"
4,Pretty good for the price,"As a camcorder it has many benefits, including easiness in using, and holding as it is very small (the size of the hand). Also the 30Gb of memory is fantastic as you don't have to worry about how much time you are spending on recording. I think that 7H are more then enough for 1 day and maybe even for 2 days. Also, 34X optical zoom is very greate and with a very good quality.On the other side being digital recording doesn't mean that the quality is very good. For example, when I focus my camera on one object, it is very good quality, whereas the sorrounding might be turbid. This is more evident when I record at night. Also, the camera which is inlcuded in this camcorder, can't be used for anything, as the quality is very bad.After all, as a camera it is very comfortable to handle, easy to use, and good quality. In short, it is worth it for the price offered. Enjoy"
4,It is a good deal for a normal user.,"I am attracted by this camcorder like many other guys by the hard disk drive function. I have used it almost 10 days and admit it is good. The camera of this machine is just so so,so don't hope it can be substituted as a camera.It can record the real world satisfactorily. yes there is some delay,when you displace the camcorder fast. when there are at the same time a shadow and a place under sunshine in the eye of camcorder, the camcorder will be puzzled for a while.So if you have excellent requirements,you will be disappointed. For normal users, It is good enough."
3,Good camera but needs some refinement,"The camera overall seems to be constructed well, controls are in logical places, and is a solid performer. There are some issues with total overall pitcure capture quality (a bit more artifacting and pixilation than I expected) and it would be nice to simple directly plug into USB and transfer instead of having to go through the motions of setting up the PC connectivity through the camera first.It's a great device for the price. Just wish it had a little more ""oomph""."
1,negative five stars,"The camera is great, but the main purpose of it is to import it to a computer. They claim its Mac compatible, but you have to buy hundreds of dollars of additional HORRIBLE software to get it to work. Their ""mac friendly"" claim is a lie and misleading. I was thinking plug in, imovie, happy. Thats what the salesman led me to believe too (because they claim its mac compatible). I'm taking it back tomorrow. PC USERS: Have fun. MAC USERS: Run while you can."
2,too dry,"Perhaps this would be a good book for a hardcore medieval history buff. The author lays down facts and geographies and genealogies, but all from an observed distance. One never feels what it is like to live in those times or in that style and culture. There was no excitment; no feel for the adventure. Too dry for me."
2,Awdaghast,"The people of Awdaghast were berbers, but they were not ""white-skinned"". They were light brown and likely ranged from yellow in color to black, like most other Northern Africans today who live between the northernmost edge of Africa and the Sahel. Thoughout all known history, this region has been a mix of the peoples who frequently migrate across it. To label this city in particular as ""white"", as if some barrier existed between it and the black cities around it, is ridiculous. This is especially true, considering that the city was founded by blacks (soninke) and was abandoned as the people (everyone - berber and non-berber) moved further south to more fertile lands."
5,This really works,I have a bone condition and this has helped me so much. I have also given to my large dog who are now 9 and 12. They have no arthritis. I started it with them when they were pappies. I figured if it was good for my pups and then I found out it is also great for mem
5,Best glucosomine on the market,The shipping is free (with Prime) and it's a third of the price charged in a store. How can you beat that?
4,Good effect,Knee pain has been reduced. I'll keep using it for a while so I can really measure its efficacy. Glad I bought it
4,Really Helps,"I have been using this product for about 6 months now, it really does relieve the pain associated with my osteoarthritis in my hip. It's not completely gone, but definitely reduced."
5,vitamins,So far so good. Shipments are quick. Pills are easy to swallow. I can't tell if they work any better than others but I will keep you posted.
5,Quality product,High quality yoy expect from Source Naturals as always. Really has helped out my hips and shoulder here as I have Lupus and RA.
1,Horrible product,This product does not help to learn the piano at all and the keyboard is a piece of junk. Also there is no customer service phone department once you have purchased the item. Just sales. So if you are having trouble setting it up good luck
2,Beware: Doesn't work with Windows 7,"This software either doesn't work at all on Windows 7 (as is the case for me), or works very poorly (as I found mentioned in several people's blogs when trying to search for solutions). I recommend saving your money until version 2.0 is released."
5,The Best. The Absolute Best!,"Celine Dion has done an awesome job on this song. It's a wonderfull song. Her voice is an absolute amazement, I love all her albums, including this one."
4,One of her best,"Celine Dion has alwayz had good songs, but this CD in particular has more pizazz, more fast songs, and is definetly more ""in"" with teens than ne of her albums. I recommend this album if you are looking for more fast beat songs, but also if you like the old Celine."
1,again and again,"her music is so predictable celine dion is the worst artiste in this decade, madonna can do better than you!"
3,what happened?,"Let me first say I'm a HUGE SYLAN fan. That being said,maybe I got spoiled by the utterly incredible Posthumous Silence, Artificial Paradise and even X-Rayed. After digging the first track, One Step Beyond, Presets falls incredibly flat.Ballad after slow ballads dictate the rest of it.It seems so simplistic after previous efforts.Maybe after making PS, which is very deep and complicated, they needed a break because these guys are much to talented to put out something so uninspiring.This is the first Slyvan cd I find myself skipping tracks trying to find something that moves me.Still a huge fan and will always buy what they put out and have faith they will get back to previous form next time. Three stars for the first and last track,everything in between seems like filler."
4,Always Never the Same,"Where have I heard that title before. Anyway, so it's alot of ballads, but it's how the ballads are presented. Lush, melodic harmonies are actually pretty good. I'm a new listener to this band, kind of stumbling upon them. I listen to RPWL and you could say their last cd was, well, enough to put you to sleep (I believe I reviewed it). With that said, as far as I'm concerned each cd from an artist needs to be different from the last. When they all start sounding the same then you might as well just buy the first one and leave it at that. Every cd out there is personal opinion and this group presents something a little bit different with this release and quite enjoyable from my point of view. Is it heavy enough, I don't know. I'm a big Dream Theater fan and each release is different from them, but still sticking to their roots, relatively speaking. Some like each release and some don't. That's just the way it is. Happy listening."
1,Worst video quality on a DVD!!,This is the worst video and audio quality i have seen on a DVD. These Lucy Show DVDs from Delta and Laserlight are horrible. Don't waste your time and money. Maybe the other reviewer was reviewing a version of The Lucy Show from another company because this set certainly does not deserve 4 stars...more like 0 stars!
5,Well Done!,This book makes a convincing case that coconut oil and coconut milk are as good for one's health as they are delicious! The chapter on the chemistry of fats is very well researched and written; it makes a complex subject easy to understand. The whole book was very nicely done.
1,A Waste of Money,"I've heard a lot about the health benefits of coconut oil and was excited to read about it. This book, however, was a big disappointment. The authors spend too much time discussing their views of trans fatty acids, flaxseed oil, antibiotics, and other subjects and very little time on coconut oil. Out of the 84 pages of text only about half actually discusses coconut oil. It's like the authors didn't know enough about coconut oil and had to pad the book with other subjects. The authors have no background or training in science or medicine and make several inaccurate statements and misinterpret some of the studies cited. Although I believe coconut oil is one of the good fats, this book did not present a very convincing argument. I thought the book was a waste of money."
1,Too many problems...,"From the moment we received this printer there were problems. First problems started when papers would continually jam in both the document feeder as well as the paper tray. Next it would not print from my computer or scan. I've had to download new drivers several times to try to fix several of the problems. Now I am receiving another message stating paper misfeed. I've searched high and low through all the compartments in this machine and there is NO paper misfeed. Assuming it's a bad sensor? Anyways, it won't print, scan, email, fax or photocopy anything. This machine is extremely fussy and not at all user friendly. So needless to say I have a $900+ printer that is fully non-functional taking up space in my office. Buyers beware!!!"
5,good value cd,"excellant cd by Rhino,with only 10 songs, but they are all good and original and the price is right, songs are:grease,blue moon,tears on my pillow,yakety yak,great balls of fire,la bamba,blue suede shoes,do you want to dance,barbara ann,save the last dance for me"
1,Poor Writing Makes It Impossible to Enjoy,"When I read the back of this novel, I was intrigued by the story and looked forward to reading it. I tried to enjoy this novel, but the poor writing and unrealistic characters made it impossible to recommend to anyone. I can see how some people can overlook the poor quality for the unusual story, but I found it difficult to ignore."
1,More Self Centered Revisionism and Hypocrisy from this Clown,"Dersh obviously carries a lot of personal guilt inside for the Holocaust and refused to let go. So here through his main character he creates a way to pretend he's brave by getting ""revenge"" today for something that happened 50 years ago. Honestly, if Dershowitz is so torn over killing innocent people that he can't let it rest than why vigorously defend such an obvious murderer has OJ Simpson? Does this mean that the Goldman and Brown families should knock off Dershowitz and his kids?Basically, this guy is ""Just a Hypocrite."""
1,Gag,"The first thing this author needs to do is learn the proper use of the words ""who"" and ""whom"". I also found it distracting that the college-student daughter calls her father ""Daddy"" and that he constantly refers to her as ""sweetie"". Gag me. I agree with the reviewer who stated that this is Judaism at its worst. I have read many wonderful and moving books with Judaism as their focus. This was not one of them."
1,"this guy is Nuts with a capital ""N""","in this book, mr. self righteous himself strongly advocates extracting harsh penalties on the innocent off spring of criminals. in that case, most his clients kids would need 24 hour guards."
1,dershowitz as we know and love him,"Trash, trash, trash. What else would one expect from the most embarrassing member of the scholarly legal profession and from a man who has singlehandedly done more than criminals to debase the American legal system."
3,education in novel form,"The ""Dersh"" once again shows his multi faceted talent in using the novel form to educate the reader in philosophy, ethics, morality, law and judaism. An enjoyable quick read,that leaves you with new insights into the victim's dillema-- Forget and be miserable,or remember and be miserable. The imaginative ending is a relief and catharsis for all."
3,Just Revenge good story line but>>>>>>>>,"The story line was very good, one recommendation and request to Mr. Dershowitz, the word ""sweetie"" was definitely overused. It gets to the point that you just dread the next time he talks to his daughter as he has to call her sweetie almost ever time. Reading about the holocaust is a worthwhile subject (even for us Christians) as this could happen at any time and place for any race or religion. Hope to see further stories that does deal in this subject and that gives us further insight in how a race of people can survive such a terrible atrocity."
1,Steer Clear of this Trash,"Wish I could give no stars. Poor writing, weak concept, self-serving author. Was given to me as a gift; little did I know it was a gag gift. :( Joke was on me, don't let it be on you."
5,A compelling view of justice only Dershowitz could write.,"This thoughtful novel brings to light the triple sword of justice as it relates to the Holocaust, the inequities of the legal system, and the ever- present dilemma of enacting a punishment that truly fits the crime. This is the second-best book I've read on the subject. As Dershowitz looks at the Holocaust from the legal perspective of one person's act of revenge versus justice, in his classic novel - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob & Zev - Jerry Marcus examines the Holocaust from the dual perspectives of one's personal responsibility to remember the atrocities, and society's responsibility to expose the roots of anti-Semitism and speak out against both its overt and subtle forms."
4,Very enjoyable,A very enjoyable plot that makes you wonder how you would find the admitted murderer...innocent or guilty? Justified or unjustified? I truly liked this book because it left me with thinking to do once I finished it.
1,SHALLOW and Predictable,"Much like the author, this book is predictable and lacks substance. It is all noise but there is nothing here to read."
1,Why Is This Guy Still Being Published?,Dershowitz is a wacko as dangerous as skinheads hiding out in log cabins in the woods. Here he advocates extracting revenge on the innocent relatives of crime perpetrators. This guy's next book (and let's hope there won't be a next) should be written behind jail cell bars. He belongs there for inciting violence.
3,This should have been as good as his legal work!,"This book has a compelling and a great idea behind it. But it fails to live up to what could have been a great novel. It's thought provoking, but the execution is weak. Too much happens at the end, and it's too neat and for my part, unrealistic and strained. And I believe there is an error in the section on the judge's instructions. If this book were as good as the author's legal work, we would have a pulitzer."
1,"Awful, Corrupt, Sick","This book asks the question: ""Is it right to commit unspeakable acts on innocent family members of criminals?"" The answer is of course ""no."" It's how one bad acts never ends and it's not even interesting. It's just nonsense. But in Dershowitz warped world anything goes. This guy is dangerous. What can you expect from the man who defended OJ?"
3,Intriguing universal questions,"Dershowitz has not written a quality literary work. The characters lack depth, dialogue is not realistic or imaginative, the plot does not exist. The genuine merit of this book lies in the questions and issues it brings to the table. If the legal system fails to punish an individual for a horrific action, does the victim or his relatives have a right to exact their brand of justice. This book presents a brilliant discussion of that issue."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"It only took me about three days to read this novel and I can't wait to read more from Dershowitz. What an excellent tale of survival and revenge (the revenge is brilliant!) There is not a slow moment in this book, yet the character shaping never suffers. Dershowitz forces the reader to examine one's own thoughts regarding justice, revenge and qualitative punishment."
1,Unrealistic with great liberties on how legal system works,Writing style is basic at best. Developoment of characters is flawed and uninteresting. The author uses great liberties in describing how our legal system is applied in a jury situation and some of it is actually inaccurate. Book does not create much suspense and many of the plots are given away by his use of present tense rather than past tense when describing the alleged murders of the Prandus family. The ending leaves you hanging and does not really address the issue of revenge murder. The book was a waste of money and the author should stick to teaching what he thinks the law is at Harvard.
3,British Review,"Get past the somewhat stupid band name and you'll find those old stalwarts from Defunkt, trombonist Joe Bowie and guitarist Kelvyn Bell, teamed with Austrian saxophonist Sigi Finkel (also on keyboards and samples). Formed in 1998, this debut was recorded in Vienna for Sony Austria, with its composer credits divided quite democratically. While Robert Riegler's slap happy bass seems to be talking in tongues, Bell's guitar chews up the wah wah pedals. Bowie blasts his trombone like a bumble bee, slipping fully out of harness when he sings on the title number and ""With Love Comes Pain"". Meanwhile, ""Ride'em Slow"" starts out as an atmospheric slink, developing a ram-drumming momentum. Bell pours out copious amounts of guitar filth, building up to an abrasive peak on the tightly-wound Bachendl, turning fast-chord chops into free-form gushes. --Martin Longley"
3,Oops...,"I thought I had finally found the 1970 Christmas album by Feliciano, with ""Feliz Navidad"" and 11 other songs (my vinyl is wearing out). But this just has 2 songs, ""Feliz Navidad"" and ""Little Drummer Boy"". Oops. The price should have clued me in."
1,Don't be misled!,"Although the two songs are quite good, note that there are ONLY TWO SONGS on this CD. The total play time is just over 5 minutes. I definitely felt cheated, since nothing in the online description prepared me for this! And the only review was clearly written by someone who had not actually heard the CD."
1,horrible guitar,finish is terrible - black paint smeared on frets - finish looks like it was done by a monkey. Worst thing I have ever seen - would be ashamed to go out in public with it - I wanted to return it immediately - I didn't expect this from amazon!
1,Buyer Beware..,"I have seen this model up close and personal. All I can say is it is NOT worth the money and WILL fall apart in a month or so. A guitar is an instrument that takes hours upon hours to build properly. This is not what you should buy to learn on. It will discourage you from day one because it sounds terrible and is harder to play (poor design & construction). The minimum price for a decent beginner guitar should fall somewhere between 300-400 dollars. Try Seagull, Yamaha, etc.. You can learn and grow with the instrument. This model is a waste of money and time."
1,Awful experience,The guitar arrived in a very flimsy cardboard box with several chips and dings in it. The neck was warped and cracked to the point that the guitar was unusable. When I took it to the music store because I could not get it to tune was when they pointed out to me that the neck was cracked and very warped. I was highly dissatisfied with this experience. I recommend not dealing with these sellers.
4,Austin Bazaar Black guitar,I was pleased with the shipping time and was thrilled with the Guitar! It was packaged with good padding and the guitar came shining clean.
1,Horrible Experience,"I purchased this guitar for my son as he is taking a class in High School. I figured it would be a good ""learning"" guitar and got it as part of his birthday gift. Within the first two weeks of school the flimsy case broke and I had to spend more money to get a decent case for it. Now (only 15 days into the school year) the guitar is falling apart and is practically unusable. Now the company is telling me they don't want to work with me because there are absolutely no returns after 30 days. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GUITAR. I know it might seem like a good deal but I've learned the hard way, ""You get what you pay for,"" and in this case it's a piece of junk."
1,"Austin Bazaar 38"" Black Guitar","What I thought was a good deal was not. 2 weeks after I received the guitar, the neck seperated from the body. The Box arrived in far far from good condition (poorly packaged for shipment). The strap connection (on the rear of the guitar body) was plastic and broken upon receipt. I am currently awaiting a reply to my customer service inquiry."
4,A part of history that needs to be remembered.,"Mary has a tremendous interest in preserving the Lincoln Highway. Having been an elementary school teacher she presents her story to children in an interesting and informative way. This is a story that all ages need to hear about America's first ""coast-to-coast"" highway. In our town, Grand Island, we have an original-mile section of paving of the Lincoln Highway, which was the second such ""Seedling Mile"" (as those first-paved sections were called) in the United States. This book is about a man's (Carl Fisher) dream of creating a highway acorss America. It tells of the struggle and dedication to build the highway as no government money was available for such projects at the time."
3,Who knew it was a kid's book?,"I was interested in the subject, but it was not described as a children's book, which it is. The information is correct, but very basic, and written so that a child may understand. I have just about every other book ever written on the Lincoln Highway, and was anxious to read new material. I don't think this was advertized as a children's book. If it had been, I would not have purchased it."
5,Link Across America is useful for travel.,"My husband and I are getting ready to make a trip from the West Coast to the Midwest, and I remembered reading the book, ""Link Across America"". This book taught me a lot about the highway. I decided to re-read the book and thought I'd like to share it with other readers. So, please, research this book if you are planning a trip down the Lincoln Highway."
1,Bad Flute,This flute was returned because of poor construction. The head joint was too loose and leaked air. The foot joint was too tight and required a hwrculean effort to assemble. It took from 9/17/07 to 10/20/07 to get my refund. I hope that this was not indicative of all of their flutes.
2,Movies don't play through,"The movies look almost bootlegged compared to previous products of same series. Movies shut off, partway through. May send back for replacements. Going to give them a few more tries, but dissappointed at this point."
3,More Chuck for the Buck,"Package recieved in good condition. No Complaint on quality of package received. This is a typical Chuck Norris, kick butt show. I mainly got this as I am somewhat of a Chuck Norris fan, and like the show. If you like the show, and have the prior seasons; this is one more for the collection."
5,Walker,Ordering the whole series for my 11 year old cousin cause he likes to watch walker when he comes in from school.
4,Charming romantic comedy,"Charming romantic comedy about a 34 year-old Indian American physician and restaurant owner searching for love. Her parents and friends all mean well by trying to help, while she just needs to follow her heart. Great original music that sets the romantic mood"
3,A Convenient Book,"This book lacks critical analysis, but it is useful as a comprehensive overview of the important pre-Islamic sites in Anatolia. Joukowsky tends to confine herself to certain labels and boundaries when discussing ancient Anatolia's civilizations, failing at times to see the fluidity and layered character of the ancient cultures she discusses. Overall, it is a good resource for Mediterranean archaeologists because it is really a collection of short site abstracts, rather than an analytical study. The writing is not always good, but the illustrations and bibliographies are helpful."
5,Simple and Solid,This stopwatch does everything I need and more. It has a solid feel and is easy to read. It does not feel like the button will stick etc. like other stopwatches I have owned. If you have to have one... treat yourself to one worth a few extra dollars for the quality.
5,Eheim 2028 Pro II Filter,"Silent filter with good flow. Easy maintenance, with long Mean Time Between Cleans (MTBC). The unit is about 18"" high and 9"" Length x width. Tubing with inlet and outlet to tank, made with good quality. Filter media is included. Good Application for filter is 50-70 gallon tank with moderate - heavy bio-load. I have one on my 56 gallon planted tank and it is ideal. My water from this filter flows though a CO2 reactor and heater. If your application is similar you would not be disappointed."
1,Rip Off Shipping Charges!!,"BUYER BEWARE! This company charges $8.80 for shipping of ANY and ALL items purchased! I ordered a single lipstick, along with other items from other sellers, and without realizing it, clicked ""ok"" to this ridiculous shipping charge. When I realized what had happened, I tried to contact the company. The receptionist basically said, ""Too bad,"" so I asked to speak with a manager who also said, ""Too bad"" and then he HUNG UP ON ME!!! I immediately contacted the manufacturer to let them know, but ultimately, nothing was done to rectify the situation. I will order directly from the manufacturer from now on and will tell everyone to avoid Cache Beauty at ALL costs. Incidentally, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the lipstick itself!!! Order from L'Paige in Dallas directly!"
5,I'm in love !!!,IS a great way to cool your cpu ...is the most faster and louder fan that you can buy ....but it guarantee that cpu and case will be cooled ...plz .. if you are married or live with your mom .. plz don't buy itor you can buy a fan controller to put it low when is cold. ..i adapted to my regular cpu fan and my cpu low more than 30 degrees ...y recommend it ...
5,Excellent ideas for the little one!,"The Little Hands Art Book is a wonderful book chocked full of creative ideas for parents, babysitters, older siblings, etc. and little ones. Great book!"
3,More Crafts than Art. found here.,"As an artist and parent who now teaches art to young children, I think this book has some cute craft ideas but is not the best introduction to art for children. I prefer Scribble Art by Mary Ann Kohl - it has a similar easy-to-read format with projects that can be adapted to almost any age, but Scribble Art involves more open-ended projects that allow for creativity and self-expression. Little Hands is more results oriented - for instance, if you want to make a quick turtle using a plastic bowl, this book will show you how. Many of projects involve a specific end result - a representational image of a pumpkin or porcupine. Granted, there are times for this; however, I prefer an approach to allows children to create their own subject matter, or explore freely within a given material or technique."
5,"Simple, realistic art projects for toddlers and preschoolers","I have a three-year old daughter with whom I wanted to explore arts and crafts. I looked at many different arts and crafts books before choosing this one to buy. Many other books that I looked at had projects that had complicated instructions or used materials that were expensive. I needed a book that I could pull off the bookshelf, open up, and pick a suitable art project quickly. Little Hands has realistic projects- by that, I mean projects that are meaningful, uncomplicated, and use basic materials that you're likely to have around the house."
3,so-so,"the only thing i got out of this was the noble eightfold path. it gets way too dictatorial on the issue of a higher power, saying that, beyond any doubt, there isn't one. well, that's hogwash regarding what the buddha said. the buddha said not to worry about such questions. instead, a person should use his techniques to destress their lives, their minds, etc. i believe in a universal higher power AND the noble eightfold path. so there."
5,Perhaps the single best simple modern book on Buddhism,"Well, I think the title says it all. This book is, perhaps, the greatest, most simple, most easily understood book for the beginning student of Buddhism ever written. Understand, however, that this book deal with only ONE school of Buddhism (Theraveda), not all schools, but this does not (in my opinion) diminish its greatness as an introductory ""text."" The simplicity of language and terms is perfect for any reader. I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to understand Buddhism for any reason."
4,An Effective Introduction,"""What the Buddha Taught"" by Walpola Rahula is an effective introduction to Buddhist thought, dealing primarily with the Four Noble Truths, and the Eight-Fold path of Buddhism. The text focuses mostly on the doctrine, and not on the life of Buddha, or the various types of Buddhism that exist. Some excerpts of classical Buddhist texts also accompany the work. Rahula offers a clear, concise introduction to Buddhist thought that should be illuminating for the introductory reader or student."
5,Good Starter Text on Buddhism,"I have some experience with Buddhism; I studied it in college in a world religion class, I asked everyone I could about their experience with it, and my girlfriend and her family are buddhist so I have some personal experience with it. This text, in my humble opinion, is a great start to a wonderful religion/philosophy. The writer straddles an academic approach and a religious instruction approach. He backs his interpretations up with primary writings and also lends his personal touch to much of the book. The book relies heavily on original teachings of the Buddha as well as the development and splintering of Buddhism since his enlightenment. If you want to delve into Buddhism, check this out."
5,I lost my first copy and was excited to purchase this book.,I really enjoy exploring Buddhism and we read this for a class I had in college. I lost the original copy and bought this because i missed being able to use as a reference.
1,Disappointed to find writing in this 'new' book,I was very disappointed to find that this 'new' book I purchased had someone's notes and underlines in the pages.
2,"Confusing, tangentical","This book was a truly frustrating introduction to Buddhism. Most of the chapters read like religious partisan rants. Rahula spent the majority of the book addressing what he felt were misconceptions about Buddhism without really explaining what Buddhism is. I agree with the reviewer who said that the second chapter was pretty much a nitpicking semantic jeremiad on the word 'dukkha.'That said, the book contains one of the greatest lines of all time: ""So Pukkusati went out in search of an alms-bowl and robes, but was unfortunately savaged by a cow and died."""
4,buddhist philosophy,"If you are looking for a book on buddihst philosophy, this is the right one. this guy knows his stuff. I understand he is a Ph on buddhist philosophy. He even quote Buddha throught out the book all the time. His explanations are very clear on the subject. I read one book from tich nat than, and this is far superior in terms of understanding. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't very satisfied in the topic about No Self or annatta or anatman. It demonstrate he doesnt know the way of Zen. Althought, he is one of the best when it comes to Theravada Buddhism."
4,A good books for experienced students and beginners alike.,"I thought this book was wonderful. I wouldn't choose it for someone who is just starting their Buddhist study, but you certainly don't have to be an expert to understand what the author is explaining. The footnotes were particularly helpful."
4,Okay,A good overview well researched but you may need to know little bit more about Buddhism to understand parts of the book.
5,Don't worry be joyous!,This book is fanastic - I too hae given loads of copies way to friends. It saved me from several years of cynical gloom and nihilism brough about by studying western philosophy and that dualist suff that has ruined our lives for so long - mind and body are not two - and there is no eternal indivisible self - so don't worry be happy and joyous!
1,Shipping took forever and horrible customer service,"The board took over two weeks to get here, and when i called the company didnt really care. I will never buy from them again."
4,My review of the Dimplex DGWH4031 heater,My heater arrived fairly quickly after I placed the order. It was easy to install except that I had to change the wall outlet to accept the type of 220 volt plug which came on the heater cord. I have an insulated workshop about the size of a single car garage. The heater will bring the temperature from about 32 degrees F to a workable 50 degrees in about an hour and a half. I'm happy with the way it performs but I'm afraid it will come at a fairly high cost on the electric bill as I had expected with an electric resistance heater.
4,Good for it's price,"Purchased this to keep my Iowa shop warm. Works good once the shop is warmed by propane heater. Will maintain temp in single car garage at a comfortable level. I don't recommend trying to use this to bring from sub freezing temps. All in all, good for it's price."
3,"Warms up the garage, sometimes too much","Installation was very simply and it does the job of warming up my garage. However......It's only been in use for about 2 months and the built-in thermostat sticks so the heater doesn't shut off at it's preset temperature!!! It just stays on full heat!!! This could be a hazard!Instead of going through the headache of sending it back for warranty service, I'm just going to buy a programmable thermostat rated for this unit and controlling it that way.I would not buy this product again due to the thermostat problem. The built-in thermostat is very cheaply made aparently. Quality should be paramount due to the type of unit that it's in. I should have looked for a unit made in the USA. This unit is, like most everything else, made in CHINA.*************************I've installed a programmable thermostat and it's working great, since it's not being controlled by it's built-in thermostat."
2,Nice unit but did not last,I installed the unit in a well insulated 800 sq ft shop. I used the unit to keep above freezing and also warm up when working in the shop on weekends. The unit was not used very hard or extensively. The unit thermostat control just failed after only 2 years of use (winter only). I will now try to get a new thermostat and update this post after dealing with the Dimplex phone menu.
4,nice little heater,"The heater works fine and is not terribly noisey either, though probably best suited for a garage or basement. It comes with a cord, something not mentioned in the description.I was surprised by the small size of it, but it is not a problem.Good value in my mind."
3,"I like it, but returned it.","I have a 2-300 square foot garage and this unit was not big enough to really heat it. It's not the fault of the unit itself. I should have been more careful in choosing one big enough to heat my space. This one did raise the temperature about 5 degrees after an hour or so of heating. If you have a smaller space and it's not as cold as mine (about 39 degrees in winter) then this might just be the one for you. It worked well, it just wasn't big enough for me."
1,terrible 0 stars.,Absolutely hate this item. Makes a ton of rattle noise like something inside is lose. Warms my one car garage to 60 but never shuts off and sounds awful. Called the company and sat on hold for well over an hour. Company and heater both very disappointing.
1,Mirbea Inn & Spa,This heaters fan is not strong enough to heat the small room that I installed it in knowing that I would have purchased something bigger. The room is not insulated.Mark Hawker - Facilities Director
4,decent little heater for the money!,"This is a decent heater for the money. I have a 75K BTU Hot Dawg that I was too late (read: too lazy, waited until there was snow on the roof so I could not vent) in installing this winter. I purchased this because it only needed 12 gauge wire (20A) 220V power and it was easy to update the 110V outlet and breaker from 110V to 20A 220V, to accommodate it. It doesn't really heat up my garage like the Hot Dawg, but it certainly takes the chill out of the air and makes it more comfortable to work in there. I just turn it on a few hours before I head out there. I like it! Not sure on the cost increase on my electric bill, but it is probably minimal since I only used it maybe 20 hours total last month. Even with this heaterit has been a cold December January in Chicagoland!"
2,Not good as garage heater,"The product quality was good, but it does not heat up garage/workshop area very well. In order to feel heat you must be within 3 feet of heater. I wanted to use to warm up workshop area prior to actually working in area and it just did not due the job. The heater is good if you are right next to it, but don't count on it to heat up work area...especially if you live in a state like Wisconsin."
1,soundtrack for Vanishing Point,CD was scratched and did not work. Too little money to fool with return and such but disappointed with the product. I guess these things happen. Alan Weathersby
2,Bayou Classic TB650 Triple Burner Outdoor Patio Stove with Extension Legs,"The frame & side tables had dents/small bends that must have occurred during shipping - not a problem, since it was an outdoor cooker. The slip fit hangers on the side tables had to be adjusted before they would fit onto the side of the frame. The extension legs are too short and need to be 36"" tall. Cooker worked fine when only 2 burners were lighted, but when all three burners were lighted and we tried to turn them all the way up, all three burners shut down. Also, the frame gives minimal wind protetion to the burners. A better/taller wind deflector would be much better when cooking outside. On the positive side, the burner flame adjustments were good, allowing cooking at low temps and high temps with good control. Perhaps the 2 burner model would be a better choice. We returned the cooker due to the third burner problem."
4,Ultimate Party Stove,"This Grill rocks, I have a griddle that fits over two of the three burners for a complete breakfast fast. Legs could be a little longer and bracket that holds the burners stronger, but all and all a tough grill."
3,Pay attention:,"Company did not prepare stove for shipping, all brass threads were damaged and had to be cleaned up with a 3 corner file. Air vent for burners do not have a accesible location for the two screws, which are placed at 12 oclock and 6 oclock, which interfere with the brass fittings for propane, should be 3-9 oclock. Stove is way toooooo low for normal use and I will have to make longer legs.Now once I have corrected most of thier ineptness, the stove does perform, all burners produce a nice clean flame both hi or low burn. I will also add wind protection to cut down on heat loss/required to maintain temperature. But the simple things really agg my butt...PROTECT BRASS THREADS FOR SHIPPING! MAKE ALL SCREWS AVAILABLE FOR ADJUSTMENT!!! PUT LOOSE SCREWS IN A BAGGY, NOT TAPED TO A LEG!!! ADD 10 INCHES TO THE LEGS TO MAKE IT A NORMAL STOVE HEIGHT!!"
3,Swamp Viking,"Assembly was careless and due to poor packing a leg had to be rewelded.But the stove works and gets the job done. Flame control is coarse and the unit needs constant watching.You don't want to do real blackened fish or even alot of pan-fried chicken indoors unless you have a bad cleaning compulsion.This unit, for all it's limits, is the way to go."
3,"Very informative, pertinent truths","Taylor gives very detailed views of the atonement. He shares several different theories on the atonement and proceeds to give argumentative reasons to views that contradict his own. Although the book is easy to understand for the most part, if you are a newer student in the area of God's atonement, I would strongly recommend an in depth study of the atonement along with this book."
5,beautiful ...,"I bought this for the Scarlatti pieces to hear his 'interpretations' and found it truly inspiring. His melodic touch, beautiful phrasing, I found unique and ethereal to put it mildly. Inspiring and a joy to listen to!"
1,Looking for a better one,"I've had this radio for a few months and I'm currently shopping for a new one! The sound quality isn't bad at low volume, but when you turn it up high enough to hear over the shower noise, it gets so distorted you can't hear a thing. Totally worthless for music, FM talk is ok, but I can only understand about 50% of what's said because of the distortion. AM reception is practically non-existant."
1,Lousy product,Can I give it 0 stars? Just don't buy this product. It doesnt work well. Try another brand. DW
3,Decent Radio,"For the price this is a decent radio. However reception for me was not to good. It could just be my location. But, I ended up adding a separate antenna to this unit. I purchased the antenna a Radio Shack and just spliced it into the small internal antenna. It now gets great reception with the 30"" antenna.I gave it 3 stars because I would assume pretty much all small radios with internal antennas will get poor reception if they aren't modded. Battery life is good using it every day I would guess they last about 3 or 4 months."
3,IM ON A EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER,"THIS BOOK WAS OK I PERSONALLY LIKED THE FIRST BOOK ""TRUE LIES"" BETTER THAN THIS ONE. IN THIS BOOK GINA GOT EXACTLY WHAT SHE DISHED OUT TO DAJAH DONE BACK TO HER. AND RICK DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS COMING OR GOING BUT HE FINALLY GOT HIS HEAD STRAIGHT,AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DAJAH DID HER THING AND CAME OUT ON TOP IN THIS BOOK."
3,This Time for Gina?,"While I am a big fan of Margaret's, my anticipation for this sequel got lost in the many twists and turns of ""Gina's Life"" which would have been a more appropriate title. While it is good to show the growth of a character, I thought there was too much concentration on her than on Dejah the one who gets burned in the first book. However, I was pleasantly surprised by one visiting character I should say, and that did spark of a ""Warm Hand"" of nostalgia."
5,Crossroads Cafe Worktext B,Nice addition to teaching English as a Second Language. I bought the video series from a library and now I can use the books to help my class prepare for viewing the tapes.
2,Babyfood,"I guess this might be a nice introduction to Plato for junior high kids, but it's not quite authentic. These are third person versions of the dialogues with a fair dose of interpretation, not simple translations of what Plato wrote(which would read something like Socrates: Meno, Can you tell me what virtue is? Is it learned? Can it be taught... Meno:... ) I was disappointed. Not the real deal. If you want the real deal make sure you preview before you buy."
4,Works of Plato,"It included the top dialogues of Plato, but did not include his cosmology (the timeus)."
4,Encouragement,I think this movie really tells you what happens when realaity hits you in the face. It's about real things that happen in real life. And it teaches a good lesson not just to young people trying to make it in life but it teaches everyone.
2,Not really a BDU...,"These pants are really just canvas civilian cargo pants that have been dyed with the ACU pattern. The style of the pants are not really consistent with the military ACU pants that are associated with the digital camo pattern and the colors are slightly off...the actual military pants are a little less pronounced. I ended up buying a pair of ""Propper"" ACU digicam pants and cutting them at the knees. While it may seem excessive, the build of the military grade pants is significantly better (in my opinion, anyway) in quality and cut. FYI - ""Propper"" makes the uniforms sold to the military, these are definitely not the same."
4,nice product and services,"nice product and services good material , delivered in time nice product and services good material , delivered in time"
3,Cheaply made,"My son initially loved this set, but within minutes the vest and telescope were broken. It is not durable at all. He loves the swords, but again, within a few hours one was broken. My son isn't rough with his toys, but with regular play the pieces were falling apart."
1,BIG waste of money,"It is really a BIG set. My son was so excited to open such a huge box. And it had plenty of items in it! But the hat wasn't able to be fixed on the head; the vest was torn in first half an hour; sword were broken till the end of a day.... So the set is VERY undurable. My son didn't break or tear anything on purpose, he was just playing - and still this set didn't survive even one day! So don't waste your money - kids will be sad......"
3,Before Thunderpuss hit their stride...,"Don't expect a progressive Chris Cox mix here. This is very much a sign of what was going on in the mainstream dance music scene before Thunderpuss brought things on really hard. The Abigail track that leads off this CD is one of the hardest, most Thunderpuss quality tracks on here. Most of the others are either dubby or of the hi-nrg variety that is just so 90s cliché. Not to say that's not fun. You get a remake/soundalike Madonna cover of Live to Tell, plus a remix of the Donna Summer dance track originally released in 1992! Even Engelbert Humperdink covers his own song with an earlier Thunderpuss mix. Time lengths:1. let the joy rise (7:49)2. Something hard (5:58)3. Tonight it's party time (6:21)4. Live to tell (5:47)5. Voo doo believe (4:40)6. Carry on (5:24)7. the way you want it (4:27)8. Who wants to be your lover (4:31)9. Release me (5:22)10. quando quando (5:07)11. Why'd ya let her (4:22)12. be my baby (5:07)"
4,"Not very essential, but nice and encouraging...","I like author's approach to things. He does not scare the reader away; he does not sound like ""the all-knowing, arrogant Hollywood pro"". He is trying to be helpful and more or less encouraging. Yet, he does talk about how things are in Hollywood realistically. He does want you, the reader, to take his advice and to try Hollywood out with his help. This book is not a must-have, but read it, just in case, if you have a chance."
2,Ok in a pinch...otherwise steer clear!,"If you don't care that your lines are clean and crisp, or you are making a cake for a 2 year old that won't care or remember how crisp and clean your lines are, then this inexpensive packet should do just fine for you. However, for anything above that, steer clear! Pay the extra for laser-cut stencils.The Wilton stencils were poorly cut, and it seemed the punch they used to cut out the images had been dull for some time, as there were messy, wispy strings of pastic coming off the cut edges. When trying to pull the image up, no matter how thin and clean the icing or spray, it always looked like an amature had been playing with it.Seriously, pay the extra $[...] a stencil for the good ones. I returned these for my money back."
4,Title goes here,"The DRIV3R gameplay isn't as great as I would have expected from a fairly solid story line, great cutscenes and music, and the big build up it had before release.But the soundtrack alone is something I listen to over and over, and Iggy's voice on the intro's just add something to it reminiscent of both the game, and a lonely midnight drive through the desert mountains."
3,WOULDN'T PLAY IN CD PLAYER!,"The music was wonderful, just as I had hoped. But the CD wouldnt work in my CD player! It just said no CD....no CD, over and over again. I even put it through my ""Automax disc repair system"" which is a real miracle worker. Everything was in mint condition, and it still plays on my computer. My CD player is several years old, and does not play MP3's. This might be my problem, but I wanted to get the word out to warn anyone else who could run into the same issues. Everything else was wonderful though!"
1,Misleading,"I did the exact same thing as the other reviewer. I read all the reviews about the movies Big Jake, The Shootist, etc., the only John Wayne movies I was even interested in, thinking those were in this collection. Now I'm literally furious that I bought this movie collection. I've noticed that amazon has removed all of those reviews now. WHY. WHY. WHY would you write reviews about 4 specific movies that had nothing to do with this collection."
4,I Dream Of Murder,"I would give this book 4 stars because I really like murderer mysteries and this is one. This book was a page turner. I could not put it down. Jere and Avery are two ordinary kids until one day they get caught up in a situation at the zoo. Jere finds out that there was a murder that he witnessed. The problem is the murderer knows that Jere saw him kill. So the murderer must kill Jere and his friend Avery. So if you read this book you might scream ""HOLY COW, SCARY! ""-Angela"
3,I Dream of Murder,I Dream of Murder By Catherine DexterMy book is a fiction book. It is about a boy in a small town and there is a man that he and his friend think murdered someone. So they go to the man's house and the girl gets caught. The book is a mystery and it makes you think. The man looks kind of poor because how he dresses. But he lives in a really big house and he also lives by his self.
4,well made,"This swing is well made, attractive, and sturdy. It will last a long time. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was that my shy bird hasn't used it, yet."
5,Quality Stainless Steel at a GREAT Price,"Using this for a homemade rear end of a chuckwagon cabinet. These are the forms that make the nice tight fit of the overhead canvas. Hard to bend and shape, but that is what is expected of steel to keep its form. Stainless is a great plus since I am using it for an outdoor cabinet."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, however it does get you a little teary eyed and sad during some scenes. What scares me most is that people still think lke this and I hope to God do not do these awful things to others due to race, color or any other differences. Some scenes predictable but overall being a true stoery I found it a good one. Eric Roberts is too funny in some scenes."
2,Old story redone,"This storyline is the sort of story one would see 40 years ago. The acting is poor, the characters are not interesting and the only good part is some of the dialogue. Still that is not going to save a movie so halfway in, I had enough and turned it off."
2,Don't waste your time,"I'm shocked at the good reviews for this movie. It was worse that a bad TV movie. Horrible acting, bizarre choices for music and a poor choice for the scenes where it was used. Everything about this was a cliche' and I ended up using it as background noise toward the end when I realized there was nothing that would redeem it. Seriously - don't waste your time or money on this one - it was just plain bad."
5,What a wonderful thrust washer,I have had months of enjoyment from this washer. The best thrust washer in the world! You will never find a better thrust washer.
3,Ok...just that...OK,"The story behind the movie had some meaning, and that is all that this film could offer...I found the overall film to be boring, typical, and in some areas downright stupid...I found this film to have a low budget look to it. I did not care much for the characters in this film, as a matter of fact, in some spots, I just plain fell asleep!!"
3,Predictable yet cute,"This was an average movie. The music was so fantastic and brilliant and you couldn't help but clap your hands with the gospel singers. Beyonce sings so well but the acting in this from her was only average - not because she can't act, but there wasn't a lot of emotion from her character.The plot was so predictable in a 'seen it before' kind of way, but it was still somehow a feel good movie and enjoyable nevertheless."
3,It's O.K!,"This isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the worst either. It's worth watching though. However, I do believe that if their weren't all those professional singers in this movie it would have been just mediocre at best. It was the singers and the soundtrack that made it actually pretty good. I absolutely love Cuba Gooding Jr, and Beyonce' may not be on the A-list as an actress yet, but she definitely shows potential."
1,"DON""T WATCH","This was one of the worst scripted and acted DVD I've ever seen. I haven't seen such crap since the cable guy. Whenever i rent a movie I always watch the end of it, no matter how bad it was. I couldn't force myself to stay. I expected a good or at least an ok movie."
1,Corny,"What happened Cuba?! As for Beyonce, she can't act her way out of a bag and will yoddle her way through a song (which is ashamed because she does have a decent voice) but is hailed as THE star of now which is why I had to sit through her performance in this film. Too contrived and too corny."
5,Fun and inspiring,"This movie is definitely NOT BORING. Cuba is offthechain hilarious when he's directing the choir, like a crazed lunatic breakdancing, pew hopping, chandelier swinging choir director. Beyonce is amazing, the Ojays are great. The performances are musically and visually captivating. ""He still loves me"" at the end was a perfect finale. And I am usually hard on movies, but this one was really enjoyable. I bought it to replay the musical sequences. Oh and there is a nice little storyline in there too. and dat gurl look-ted good 2..."
4,The musical is back,"Cuba was great, even Beyonce was good (singing) not acting. I loved the supporting cast and the old school gospels were wonderful to hear. This is a light-hearted, feel good movie. If you don't like it or think it is boring, as one review said, they must be the boring ones.....or perhaps it was a bit over their heads.....maybe they didn't understand the black church or humor.....get over it.....this movie was da bomb!"
4,let's give credit,I went to see this movie with my husband and whilst it did not have great reviews in the UK it only goes to show that people who review movies should understand the race and understand the jokes etc. it was a good entertaining movie and one i can watch with my whole family again and again. so let's try to always give credit where it is due.
4,tempted 2 buy temptations?.... YES!,"Fighting temptations is a sweet, cool film, with so many amazingly talented actors who can not only act but r amazing singers too.Although there are slightly cringingly corny moments the wonderful + light comedy of the film satifyingly over shadows it.Beyonce adds a real sexy and classy touch to the film and the astounding sultryness of her voice is bound to hav u admiring her many a time. The funky and soulful songs not only makes u wana get up and sing and dance but go down 2 ur local HMV + buy the soundtrack!The downsides r if ur not in2 gospel or singin, this movie is definetly not 4 u!Although this is a real feel good movie all over, i did feel like there was Somthin missin.Hope my review helped u make the right choice ***"
2,Needs editing,"The book is, I think, intended to add depth to existing federal advisory circulars. But the huge number of errors in it defeat it. Most are typos and homonyms and are probably not going to lead a pilot into a dangerous situation, but they are pretty tedious and confusing."
3,Do not buy this if you have an Intel Mac!!!,"I accidentally bought this not knowing it would not run well at all on an Intel Mac. My mistake, don't do the same!"
4,Definitely Worth 8 bucks.,"I ordered this game because I wanted something new and you can't beat an 8 buck price tag. I worried as some people mentioned frame rate problems and such. No problems here with a first generation Macbook Pro and 10.4. It plays pretty seamlessly.Overall, the game is solid. Some of the cut scenes are a bit long and you keep doing the same thing over and over--eating brains--but it is a nice game to turn off your mind and just enjoy. You don't have to use 50 zillion keys to run it--in fact, I used my touch pad and about 8 keys with no problems. Some sophomoric humor, but a solid game.Is it Halo? No. Is it Medal of Honor? No. Is it fun? Yes. Will I replay it? No, probably not. Is it worth 8 bucks? Yes. For that price, I'll pass it on to a friend and let him enjoy it, too.YMMV."
4,"I'm not much of a gamer, but...","...this title looked too fun to pass up.I was a little worried by some of the reviews here and on the Apple site suggesting that the game would not play on Intel Macs. I have a first generation Intel iMac with a 1.83 GHz core duo processor, ATI Radeon X1600 graphics card and 1GB of RAM. I had some issues in the beginning because I hadn't copied the game folder to my hard drive as instructed in the ""Readme"" file. D'oh!The game started up fine and played as well as could be expected running under Rosetta. Tweaking the game settings also improved the overall experience."
3,Not a review but a caution,"I want to make sure potential customers realize that ""Stubbs the Zombie"" cannot be played on a Mac OS that is 10.3.9 or lower. The game requires a video card your machine won't have, that costs about half the original price of your system. It's too bad, too - looks like a fun game. Sigh."
2,"Fun game, but security is a nuisance","Stubbs is a great game - fun story line, excellent graphics, outstanding soundtrack, ... but ... you have to LOAD THE ORIGINAL DISK INTO YOUR COMPUTER EACH TIME YOU PLAY IT! You can't just load the game, and go on your way. I thought that I may have made a mistake when installing it, so I opened a support ticket, and their answer was ... this is a security feature, to prevent illegal copying of their game ... This isn't convenient if you plan to load it on your laptop, and take it on the road, but if you're sitting home on a desktop, ... go for it."
4,Berzerko Zombie Action!,"I agree with the people up top who say that Mac just doesn't make good action games playable on their systems. I have a LOT of memory that I put into this iMac just for games, even though I only have Stubbs, KOTOR and Warcraft III! This game is great, the humor is very tongue-in-cheek, and if your Mac is tough enough, the game plays great. Be warned: as the other reviewers said, you need a powerful engine to get this game playing smoothly. Aspyr Media tries to port well, but like KOTOR, Stubbs needs adjusting before you play. configuration-wise.However, if your Mac is up to par, play this and find out why it became the sleeper hit game of the past year! Trult addictive and hilarious!"
1,Disappointin,"I found this much too hard to control. I gave up on Stubbs after less than two hours of play. I'm glad that I'm only out $7.99 + tax, I would have been really upset if I had payed full price."
4,Nursing Theories: The Base of Professional Nursing Practice (5th Edition),I had to purchase this book for a class. The material is a little dry but otherwise the book is well written.
3,"Works well, but watch the hose!","I'm giving this 3 stars because of the water stain on my carpet!The cooler works well the few times we've used it. It doesn't seem to need super-low humidity.When we received the unit, we read the instructions thoroughly. We added water & we turned it on. We were pleased at the cool air it generated.About 1/2 hour later, we checked the unit & the water was almost empty. It turns out that there is a hose that circulates the water back into the water tray. That hose rests (on the right side of the unit) on a flat tray with a small hole in it, and it was supposed to drip back into the water reservoir. However the water flies out of that hose so quickly it overwhelms the flat tray & then leaks out of the bottom of the unit... and onto the carpet!Once we readjusted the hose so that the water actually went back into the water reservoir, it seems to work fine & no more leaks."
5,Absolutely fantastic.,"Low price but it looks pretty slick. Great remote that sticks to the side of the unit with a magnet. Let me just say, I have had this air cooler for 5 years now. Used virtually every day for hours at a time during summer and it still works nicely, every single function. Very effective heater in winter. As it's gotten older, it has to sort of warm up longer and longer till the fan slowly gets up to full speed... Odd. But apart from that as long as you keep the removable air filter clean (just rinse it) it does everything remarkably well. I cannot recommend this enough.Keep in mind it's NOT an air conditioner, it doesn't have a huge effect on the temperature even with the frozen bits. In fact, living about 150 yards from the shoreline, on a hot humid day the added humidity can actually make you feel hotter. This is the same for any evaporative cooler however so I certainly can't lover the rating for it."
1,Noisy and awkward,I am sending this item back. It made a loud moaning sound. The directions were very difficult to understand. It was hard to put water into the tank and letting the water out was equally difficult. The unit is also very large.
1,No cooling,I use it in a room of about 1500 sq ft. I have a central air conditioner which was not enough for my bedroom. So I was trying to get a couple degrees lower and run it at night. The ice packs (3) were useless. No cooling at all. Just another fan.
4,Alabama Curiosities,"A ""Can't Put It Down"" kind of book. Gave one as a gift and it almost broke up that marriage! Lots of facinating stuff. A great investment. Be ready to get hooked."
3,This is for HR but not technical recruiters,"Like the person from Malibu, I found this book to be extremely helpful for a Human Resources professional who is new to the internet. However, if you are already savvy with internet search engines, seeking candidates on the usenet and utilizing the multitude of internet resources, this book is not for you. If you are looking for advanced candidate resourcing strategies, take a class from AIRS or Tiburon Consulting. Overall, it didn't serve my purposes but, speaking from personal experience, this book is sorely need by many HR professionals and it could help them immensely."
3,Beginners,A lot of USEFUL INFO for a beginner or Junior level HR and Recruiting professional.... like the URL's of career websites and HR organisations but no indepth information for seasoned Recruiters.
2,Fair,"Although I found some of the content interesting and worthwhile, I did not find it that it helped me enough in my day-to-day needs as a recruiter."
3,"OK, but disappointing","It's gray, no tones of blue like it looks on two different monitors. There were two tiny chips around the rim when it arrived, and after using it one time, there's a hairline crack in the bowl. Not worth the expense and hassle of returning, or I would. Maybe it won't make any difference in being able to use it, long-term. Prompt shipment, though, and it came with sample essential oil and a tea light candle, so I could use it right away."
2,smaller than expected,Overpriced and doesn't look good after a few uses. My essential oils leave greasy spots on this diffuser. Find a better one at your local grocery strore!
