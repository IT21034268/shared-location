3,If you like Will Ferrell you'll love this movie,"I wasn't holding my gut laughing at the comedic twists and turns but I will say it was entertaining.I would consider this a family friendly movie, however, as always check the rating and make your own decision.I wouldn't pay much more than $3 to rent it. It was a typical Will Ferrell better than average movie."
2,Campaign,"I want my $2 back. I fell asleep and tried to watch the next day, but found better things to do. .... Amazon is great, just get the price down to 0.10 cents"
3,It's really just ok,This movie is really just ok. Some funny parts - other parts just gross. Was not as funny as I hoped.
4,Funny,"Good movie. Will Ferrell is great as always. Good storyline, Our political leaders can learn a few things from this movie."
1,Don't waste the time or money.,It was a terrible movie that had zero funny parts to it. Lame doesn't even come close to describing it.
3,Funny,"I already love Will Ferrell and now I love Zach Galifianakis even more. Go see it, It is a funnnnny,"
3,worth watching,worth watching one time at least. had some laughs. good background movie. I liked step brothers more than this movie.
1,Soooo not funny,There's really nothing positive to be said about this film other than it was mercifully short. Please look elsewhere for laughs and light entertainment (you won't find it here).
1,Absolute garbage,"I would rate this at no stars, if I could. Not funny in the slightest. I like crude humour at times, but this was just stupid, boring and tedious."
1,"Cheap, crude attempts at humor",One of the worst movies of this or any other year. Very disappointing performances by Farrell and Galifianakis. These 2 candidates both lost!
1,Wish it could be rated 0 stars.,"Vulgar, nasty, watched every bit of 3 min. before I cut it off. Should be rated X just for abusive unnecessary language. Just not for me or my family."
3,If all campaigns could end this way !,"A Will Ferrell gem ! Hilarious. Really right on the mark for this election year. Loved the baby punching scene (glad no baby was hurt in the making of that film), the ever growing flag pins, Ferrell's recitation of the Lord's prayer etc. Alot of fun to watch !"
3,Good movie,The movie is pretty funny but there are parts where it gets kinda crazy. If you want a movie that picks fun at politics this is the movie.
3,"Good Movie If Ignore Typical Ferrell Bathroom ""Humor""","There's some of Will Ferrell's usual arrested-development, adolescent level ""humor"" in this movie, but once you get beyond that, it's a fine, entertaining, even somewhat sophisticated movie that does a good job of lampooning the 2012 corporate attempts to buy an election. Zack Galifiniakis's performance was fun, touching, hilarious at times, and well crafted. Will Ferrell even managed a surprising level of craft at times. The story is well constructed and the movie as a whole is entertaining and satisfying. But, those sensitive to the ""F"" word should avoid it."
2,A one joke movie . . .,. . . and a very tired one at that. Very boring except for the moments that Shirley McLaine is on screen.
3,Decent Film - Typical Will Farrell comedy... Fun to watch,The Film itself is unfortunately more relevant than most of us would like to believe considering the current elections ridiculous tactics on both sides of the aisle. Will Farrell is funny. Its not his best work but if you like him and his comedy you will no doubt enjoy the movie. Galifianakis is also good. Not his best work but funny non the less. The movie itself is ok. Not as funny as I had hoped but still enjoyable as I like Will Ferrells comedy. Its worth renting. Not sure about buying. It all depends if you have a Will Ferrell movie collection. I recommend it for a rental.
3,Great humor,"Great humor, Ferrell does the jackass white guy again and does it well.The story is based on the same old tired cliche;Rich powerful guys corrupt the system but lose in the end to the honest altruistic simpleton. It appeals to people's needs to blame the successful for their own failings not unlike some politicians today. 1% vs 99%, yadda, yadda, yadda. No real basis in reality but that's what a movie is most of the time. It's funny and worth watching."
3,video blurry,"Did not rent the HD version but another review said that they had and they experienced the problem with quality as I had. The video was blurry most of the way through. From what I could make, the video was entertaining otherwise."
3,Good for lighthearted fun,"The Campaign is a good comedy. It's not fall out of your chair funny, but it definitely has its moments. Enjoy!"
3,james,"it was ok about what i thought it would be. will ferrell is not funny alone , as long as he has a sidekick he does ok..."
3,A little much,"This movie just was a little over the top. It started out okay, but just went a little too far in the jokes, almost like it was trying too hard to be funny. But it did have a plot."
4,Very funny but a lot language and sexual undertones,Very funny but a lot language and sexual undertones. It is especially funny during a presidential election year as it points out the silliness of it all.
1,CRAPPY SPEED,Had problems watching movie due to low quality. Send message into support and they had me do a lot of stuff. Nothing seemed to work.
2,Disappointing,"It truly takes some effort to make a movie as unfunny as this, particularly when it stars Galifinakis and Ferrell. Don't bother."
1,didn't meet expectations,"I think these two guys are hysterical, just not in this movie. It just wasn't that funny. Sure, there were a couple of funny parts, but largely it was just vulgar. They got lazy and this could have, and should have been a great movie, but it wasn't."
2,Quality terrible,Although we purchased this in High Definition the quality was very poor. I would not recommend it and wish I could get a credit for it
1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your money either. This movie is offensive on many levels, and not very funny at best. It contains bathroom humor, vulgar language, and extra-marital affairs. Not worth it. Definitely not appropriate for kids."
2,Don't waste your money or time on this one.,"Typical Will Ferrill movie. Silliness, sprinkled with vulgarity are not enough to save this movie. I would not recommend this movie."
1,Filthy humor that was not humorous,"Filthy humor in some scenes did not add anything to subject, rather detracted from an otherwise funny movie. When you cant be funny and original always resort to base pornography to cover."
1,It wasn't funny,"First off, the Amazon stream of it is just fine. My review reflects the movie itself.I thought the movie was unnecessarily crude and just wasn't funny. The movie felt like it was trying too hard to fit the jokes in from the trailer into it and then to ultimately serve as an indictment against the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling. I know at the end of the day the likability of this movie is going to hinge on whether you find it funny or not. I liked Talladega Nights, but I did not care for this movie."
3,Had it's moments,Love Will and Zach together. Kind of slowed down towards the end. Definitely had it's hilarious moments. Would recommend to a friend.
2,Lame,Boring. All the best parts were shown in the trailer. I hate when they do that in movies. Very cheesy
4,The Campaign,Hilarious movie. My wife and I couldn't stop laughing. Will Ferrell did it again. Highly recommended by my wife and I.
3,Funny enough,"Funny, not amazing. I'll forget it in a week. Fine to watch when you are bored and home alone drinking a beer."
2,Why?,Just another stupid comedy in which Will Ferrel portrays another mind numbing actor with witty comedic lines and even worse scenes.
4,A good chuckle,"If you like campy, slap your knee comedy you'll get a good laugh out of this one. Classic Will Ferrell."
3,Good one liners,Had some good one liners. Didn't keep you laughing like other Will Ferrel movies. Still fun to watch though! Ok
3,Okay,"Not family friendly, sort of nasty..would't buy it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because of it's nastiness."
3,Funny!,Funny but not as Funny as Ricky Bobby. I love Will Ferrell. Just not my favorite of his. Two more words needed to fill this comment.
3,Falls short,"Wanted to love it, but the funny moments are too infrequent. Too much narrative for my taste. Needed more interaction with Farrell and Galafanakis."
3,This one is just fine,"I'm a sucker for Will Ferrell, but this one is just ok. He does punch a baby though so that's something."
4,Two of my favorite comedians,"I love Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis! They are pretty hilarious in this movie! It is a little vulgar, though."
2,This movie was silly but sucked,This movie was just not good. It had some funny jokes but then the movie fell apart and wasn't good. This is one of the only wath it once WF movies.
2,Not Will Ferrell's Best Movie,"This movie was not very good at all some humorous parts in it to get a little chuckle but like I said, very rarely it is funny and it was more sexist than ever and innapropriate to women."
5,Hillarious!,Loved this movie! This is a good movie if you like to laugh. Great for a night with friends! =)
1,so so,"I don't really know what to say, except it was so so, again alot of cussing, and i did not quite get the story line."
1,the campaign,"I really didn't like this movie, the story line wasn't that good and wasn't really that funny at all to say it dragged too."
3,Far from my favorite Ferrell Movie,"Not as good as you expect a will ferrell movie to be. Needless to say, the funniest parts were in the preview. I wouldn't watch it again."
3,good movie,"I watched this with the thoguht i would hate it- i didn't. Will Ferrell, who i think it incredible talented when put on a leash like Jim Carey) went crazy and make me laugh several times. Zach Galifianakis was amusing and played a convincing shy congressman. It was nice to see the good guy win and to be honest- to see a nice ending to movie. I was pleasantly surprised."
2,My least favorite Will Ferrell movie to date.,"There were a few funny parts but overall The movie was a disappointment. If you want to see it for your self, wait till it come for free."
4,Funny movie,Great cast good movie I Enjoyed it went a little overboard on trying to be funny at times but all in all I liked it I am not much of a movie person but would recommend this movie for a few laughs enjoy
3,not as good as step brothers,"the glitchy playback about midway through the movie was annoying. maybe it was my FIOS service (15/5 connection, saturday night, no one else online) maybe it was Amazon. I'll probably never know. What I know is it sucked to sit there watching momentarily frozen scenes and then waiting as the video reloaded.Apart from that, it had its funny parts and a well-heeded warning about the role of money in politics but ultimately just an average comedy."
2,Time to hang it up,"Been a big will ferrell fan for a while, but hes got to hang it up. He plays the SAME roll in all his movies this is no different then any of his past movies. It was very predictable which really took away from the comedy. Zach is pretty much typecast-ed into the same roll again as well. Expected more, not as funny as i was expecting."
3,"Funny, but not great.","There were one or two laugh-out-loud moments, but overall the movie was fairly average. Nothing spectacular and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,"gross sex humor, not overly funny",I was a bit disappointed by this movie. The sex humor was gross and unnecessary. It was not as funny as I was expecting.
2,Boring.,The movie is a typical repeat of Farrell film (with different names and scene). Funniest moments appear in the trailer and it's downhill from there.
3,Did I Miss Something ?,"Huge fan of both, but this movie really sucked... Seemed to have been thrown together in minutes and just in time for an election..."
3,Great film,"Had to watch it on my laptop because it doesn't work outside the USA & Canada. That said, hilarious film!"
2,It's not for everyone,"Although the comedic acting of both Will Ferrel and Zach Gallifinakis was complemetned by some very silly lines as well as timely delivered physical humor, the overall story of the film lacked enough force to be driven by these comdey heavyweights alone. I would still say it is worth a handful of cheap laughs, but by no means as good as any other Will Ferrel comedy, except for maybe Land of the Lost and Elf. I would sooner watch Night at the Roxbury before watching this again."
3,It's just about what you would expect.,"If you're looking for a movie to watch that will change your life, do not watch ""The Campaign."" If you just want to watch a goofy movie that's kind of funny, ""The Campaign"" will fit the bill."
4,The Campaign,GREAT MOVIE! Would recommend to ALL! Thanks Amazon for a great site and the total ease of purchasing videos. I have to admit though that EVERY time we pause a movie it gets locked up and there is a major delay. Please fix this issue. Thanks much!
4,Funny but crude,It's a Will Ferrell movie so it shouldn't be a surprise that this movie has some really crude moments. Not for children but some laugh out loud moments are to be found. Probably a semi-realistic look at some of our esteemed politicians.
3,movie,typical will ferrell movie. It had a lot of funny parts in it and I enjoyed watching it but I dont think I would watch it more than one time
2,Why can't Hollywood keep their politics to themselves?,"An ok movie with some funny moments and lines.It might have been better if there wasn't so much obvious one sided political stereotypes and agendas. I don't care what side of the aisle anyone in Hollywood is on when I want to watch a movie or tv, I just want to be entertained especially a comedy. If I want information and or to be influenced or reinforce my npersonal political views I know where or how to seek out those sources of entertainment. I wouldn't look for it in a comedy. I'm sure the Koch brothers are giggling about how much money is used for this movie and movies like it to be made and the shown to people that don't know the real life references being mocked no matter how poorly."
2,Rent it from redbox,Only one or two funny parts. Played on my phone instead of watching . Looked funnier on tv.Rent don't buy
1,A terrible waste of the talents of Will Ferrell & Zach Galifianakis,And why was this horrible movie delayed & blocked from Netflix DVD rentals? I suspect a conspiracy that goes straight to BEZOS.
1,The Campaign,"I was concerned in advance as so many Wil Ferrel movies are childish and lack of any sense that it would be viewed by someone with a brain. I was correct, this one may be the worst yet."
3,OK,A bored night at home convinced me to check out this movie. I am not exactly sure why because frankly Will Ferrell hasn't been funny since Old School. It had its moments but not as funny as it could and should have been for all the commercials on tv.
1,Terrible,I had high expectations from this movie and unfortunately was just terrible. There were very few laughs and I was sitting there bored the entire movie wondering when it was going to end.
1,Not Good,"Really? Who's idea was it to make Zack a closet, repressed, southern gay male? They should be impeached. It was just bad."
3,OK,"Will Ferrell movies tend to be a hit and a miss with me, but for the most part a hit. This was somewhere in between. There were a few moments, some would deem them crude while I find them hilarious, other than that I was very light humor that at times was a bit reaching for laughs. Zack Galifianakis had his moments but after a while the effeminate accent was kinda of annoying (similar to the one from his Netflix special). Aside from the few crude moments (and Dan Ackroyd) the funniest part-and saddest- is the realization of how true the movie probably is with respect to political commentary."
3,Wait until Prime,"Not too bad, mildly amusing and topical. Definitely not the best work of these two, but would be worth a watch when it goes to Prime."
2,stink a roo,I am a fan of both leads and I really wanted to like it but I just didn't. I think it is one that I would have preferred to see free when there was nothing else to watch.
3,Not their greatest work,"I thought the comedy duo of Farrell and Zack G. would be great, but I was unimpressed. While their were certainly funny parts, I wasn't rolling on the floor like other movies I've watched with them in it."
3,"funny, could have been funnier","I didnt go in expecting too much. I did laugh, it was enjoyable but could ahve been funnier in my opinion. not too bad just dont expect a whole lot from it. these two were a great paring though for the movie."
2,A couple laughs,"Generally, a good 30 minute movie stretched out to an hour and a half. Great characters. Dragging script. ""Election"" is a better choice in the genre."
1,A twisted view of the facts,This is a twisted version of the facts. A lesson on humanitarian principles and peace would serve well to the author
5,Memoir from the Black Forest,"Marcy Jarvis's A Broad in Swabia is a real find. Once I started to read, I couldn't put down the book. The style is engaging and energetic, and the stories leap off the page. A strong and powerful voice.Irene Gammel, Prince Edward Island"
4,A Broad in Swabia --,"I was thrilled to engage with this witty and sophisticated book. Even though I know very little of Swabia, I particularly enjoyed the transcultural flavour which brought the narrative together. Jarvis rivals many of America's great humorists.Jean Paul Boudreau,Ryerson University, Toronto"
5,best to read the WHOLE book,"My parents first sent me on my own to visit my paternal grandparents in Swabia when I was nine years old. I was so excited to find a book about the place that I'd visited every few years during my youth. I read this book several years back but would very much like to read it again (whoever I lent it to, please return it!!). I do recall that the attitude of the author transforms (about many, though not all things) from the beginning of the book to the end, and therefore you should commit to reading the whole book before you start it. I'll write more someday - after I've had a chance to read it again!"
2,Not that great,"I have a Millers Forge nail clipper that I really like, but these scissors feel cheaply made. The scissoring action isn't smooth; it gets kind of caught mid-snip. Winds up pulling the hair as I'm clipping the hair between the pads of my dog's feet and it freaks him out. Still looking for a good pair of scissors for that purpose."
2,you get what you pay for,"these are very cheap scissors..........they were the only curved scissors with blunt ends i found so i gave it a try..........wish they were smaller for cutting around the eyes.......will have to find other.....smaller, sharper scissors for my 2 five pound maltese......"
1,Terrible product.,"I have purchased these and thinning shears and they are both cheap and totally useless. I feel like I wasted my money completely with both products.They were to hard to open and close and tore my dogs hair out, especially the thinning shears. If all of the Millers Forge products are this bad, I will not bother purchasing anything else made by this company. Save your money, they won't even cut paper."
2,Quack and Flap Duck FLOPPED!,"This gift was purchased for my 10 month grandaughter for Easter. She showed zero interest. Her 2 year old brother spent less than 5 minutes with it then it was forgotten forever. The wings did flap and the feet flopped, though you did have to apply a little pressure whether on the carpet or bare floor. Otherwise it had a tendancy to slip. This is a case where I WISH I'd listened to the reviews, but I was going for a theme here. It was Easter and I raise and sell ducks and duck eggs, Soooo... There you have it. No, I wouldn't waste my money again."
2,Quack and Flap was a total flop,"Not only does this toy feel flimsy, but no one in our family could get it to work correctly. Sometimes we could get it to roll and get the feet to ""flop."" But most of the time it did nothing unless we applied just the right amount of pressure and had it on the carpet. Everyone gave it a try. Our 1 year old, our 3 year old, my husband, grandpa, etc. None of us could get it to work the way it should reliably. It's back in the box and on it's way back to the toy store where it was purchased. Pass on the Quack and Flap and get a toy that a child can actually use."
2,LATE,"I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS WATCH. I ORDERED AS A GIFT FOR SOME ONE VERY CLOSE TO ME. I PLACED MY ORDER ON DEC 2 AND PAID FOR 2DAY SHIPPING, I DID NOT RECEIVE MY ORDER UNTIL DEC 23. I HAD TO CALL SEVERAL TIMES WITH LITTLE HELP. I DIDNT EVEN GET REFUNDED ON THE COST FOR 2DAY SHIPPING NOR DID ANYONE EVEN SUGGEST SOME SORT OF REFUND. THE WATCH IS BEAUTIFUL BUT I DOUBT I ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN."
1,"Innacurate Humidity Reading, Calibration Does Not Work","I compared this unit with a ""Western Humidor Caliber III"" hygrometer which I had tested in a controlled environment (75.5% Humidipak Calibration Kit). The Caliber III unit was dead-on which surprised me since I only paid $20 for that. The Extech was off by between 8% to 10%. The Extech has a calibration screw in the back so I tried calibrating it to match my other hygrometer but the screw doesnt even do anything!!! It just pointlessly TURNS! The temperature however was accurate. FINAL THOUGHTS: I'm buying another Caliber III Hygrometer and returning this one. The Caliber III is accurate within 1% Relative Humidity."
2,"Humidity reading drifted, calibration doesn't work","I've had this for 2-1/2 years. At first it seemed to compare well to two other humidity sensors I had. Over time the humidity reading has drifted downward, and it now reads about 15% low compared to the other sensors. As other reviewers have reported, the humidity calibration screw does not work -- unlike the temperature calibration screw, which works fine.So I'd echo the suggestion made by another reviewer that if you buy this, you should check the operation of the calibration screws right away instead of waiting until you need to use them. (On mine these screws were covered by small foam pads that I had to peel off. Don't make the mistake of trying to ""adjust"" the nearby Phillips-head screws that hold the case together.)I would have expected better from Extech."
1,Owned since April 2009 - room temp is now stuck at 176 F,"Extech 445814 HygroThermometerBEWARE!! I've owned this instrument since April 2009. A few weeks ago [11/2009] I noticed the room temperature is now PERMANENTLY 176 degrees Farenheit-- just as this reviewer experienced. The ""humidity calibration adjust"" screw has no effect on this temperature reading no matter how many times one turns the screw. Naturally, the ""relative humidity"" is radically incorrect since it is linked to this unmoveable 176 F temperature.I have tried reset. I have tried removing batteries and reinserting new ones. Still 176F.As far as I can see there is NO WARRANTEE indicated either on the ""User Guide"" or the packaging."
1,good looking but very poor quality,"I live in Sao Paulo, Brazil , and wanted a third themometer/higrometer to monitor temperature and humidity in my apartment.The higrometer doesn't match the readings of the other two, the difference being more than 10 percentual points.The so called "" humidity calibration adjust"" doesn't work.Then after two weeks suddenly the temperature reading jumped to a fixed value of 80 degrees Celsius (same as 176 degrees Farenheit).I tried the ""temperature calibration adjust"" that also is a fake: it doesn't work.Pity: the product is good looking but the quality is not built in it.I am very disappointed by the purchasing of this product.I had to give one star rating just because ZERO is not accepted by the system."
3,about the artwork quality,I just wanted to clarify something in light of the previous reviewer's comments. The reason the art quality is less than stunning is that Callahan is a quadrapalegic and has to draw with a pen held in his mouth. And I've seen other professional cartoonists who don't draw any better despite having more experience and the use of both hands.
2,The noise isn't appealing to my dogs,"So my dogs love talking/singing toys and I thought this one would be great. When I made it chirp for the first time they both just looked at it, almost like the noise was so real they didn't want to attack a little chick! Then, when my sister's dogs came to visit and only her Boston would play with it, her mix did the same thing as my dogs! It's a cute little toy and it makes a loud chirping noise, but 3 out of 4 of my dogs were turned off by it."
4,A starting point for exploring your own wine preferences,The author has divided the wine world into a manageable numberof intuitive categories. There is also sufficient detailto distinguish wines within a category. Try some of thewines in each classification. When you find some you likeyou'll have discovered many more you will likely enjoy.Beyond the author's clever taxonomy is good introductorymaterial on the basics and beyond. A great reference anda fun roadmap!
5,A punk band goes metal,"I first got this on cassette in th 80's around the time it came out. A guitarist/friend of mine got me into it. The album starts out with a guitar groove and the guitar keeps a solid groove through the whole album. There are changes though with very good musicianship for the times when it seemed Metallica dominated the whole scene. There were so many good metal bands in the 80's besides Metallica. The vocals kinda have a crossover feel to them a little bit punk and a little bit metal.I have been looking for this album for a long time, it was so refreshing to hear it again. If you are a crossover fan you should like this little treat but it does lean more on the metal side of things. I had two other albums by them but I like this one best out of the ones I have heard. Check it out!"
2,"Meeh....they're great, if your shooting one shot at a time.","First of all when I bought these, they were pricey, compared to buying .68 or .50 caliber paintballs. It's nice if you already have an airsoft gun and just want to shoot some paint. But I warn you if you have metal clips for pistol, they break easily within the clip and leave a nasty oily mess to clean up. The same thing happens if you shoot the paint too fast and I'm not talking about going auto, just shooting quickly in semi auto can break the paintballs when they're getting loaded up. The paintballs are fun but, for the price, low amount and relatively low shelf life, they just aren't worth it."
2,New technology equals outdated media,"Why these letters have not been placed in CD_ROM format puzzles little old me. Sometimes the annotation includes letters from all over the place, making the sequence hard to follow. Sure, researchers may like this sort of stuff, but I bet even they know better ways of putting it together."
4,I'm on the fence,"I'm really on the fence about this multi vitamin; it's not quite complete for cats (which is fine, we use an additional supplement), but my biggest concern is the inclusion of garlic in the formula, which according to several sources is just a bad idea.UPDATE:After doing some more research, I updated from three to FOUR stars, and I'm much less on the fence. Among other things, I contacted the company who makes this vitamin and got a prompt and polite email back (on Christmas Eve no less) which really impressed me (both the promptness of the email and the information provided). I'm feeling much more comfortable continuing to give this to my kids. Cat parents just need to be aware that kitties need a little more than this provides (if they're like me and not feeding raw organ meat)."
5,Excellent Supplement,"Animal Essentials is a high quality, trustworthy brand and this particular formula, recommended to me by both our traditional and holistic vets is as complete a vitamin/mineral supplement as you can find. Like other great brands (Thorne, Resources, Nordic Naturals and others) Animal Essentials is recommended by veterinary trade magazines and journals. I read and research ingredients very, very carefully, and after reading through the ingredients of the popular brands sold on pet store shelves, I'm not sold on any of them."
1,Unsure of the rating at this time,"My Lhasa Apso has Inflammatory Bowel Disease and I started this product a few weeks back. She had a flare-up a few days after beginning the vitamins and at this time, I'm not sure if the vitamins were the cause or not. She is on a home cooked diet, due to her inability to tolerate most commercial dog food, so I felt she needed some supplemental vitamins. At this time, I've taken her off the vitamins until her intestinal tract settles back down and plan to try the vitamins again within a few days. Therefore, I'm unable to rate the vitamins at this time."
2,Lackluster Performance,"Just compare this performance with the early Angel stereo recording with Corelli-Las Scala, or the 1980 Somingo Video, or the 1994 Pavarotti Met performance available on DVD or Youtube. You will see what I mean. Not recommended."
1,A hideous performance,"I knew as soon I heard the first ""Grazie, Grazie"" of Blind Tenor Andrea Bocelli that I was in for a rough time: Bocelli is totally overmatched in the role, without a single redeeming quality to the performance; Bocelli does not even give dramatic compensation. In his unpassionate Canio, there is no fire, no sturm und drang, only the occasional yelp that signifies severe distress.Luckily, Canio has little to sing beyond his major arias, and Bocelli is surrounded by a compitant (if not wonderful) supporting cast, who manage to weather their below-standard Canio and also their lackluster Conductor. Both Baritones are unexceptional but unobjectionable (the Silvo does some very nice work in the love duet) and the Beppe (a part Bocelli COULD pull off if he wanted to) is sweet-voiced. The Nedda, Ana Maria Martinez, is actually quite good, and it's a shame to see her opposite such a dire leading man. Avoid like the plauge."
4,The finer points of web site globalization,"This work gets under the skin of the web site globalization industry. Highly recommended for students of international marketing, and extremely rich in references. Nitish Singh and Arun Pereira get down to the nitty-gritty of numbers, colors and other cultural aspects of web site globalization. They present an enormous wealth of well researched material, sprinkled with pearls of wisdom, in a very readable book."
5,Who could ask for more?,"I purchased a Canon PowerShot G1 but had not yet received it. I knew that I was going to need CF larger than the OEM 16M. I could find nothing stating that the G1 was compatable with CF larger than 128M, which was the largest one listed on SanDisk's web site. The price prompted me to take a chance. I'm glad I did! The camera formated it without a hitch. Used 8M for system and left 244 M usable for pictures. It downloaded and reformated with out a hitch. Since I am a first time user of digital cameras I can't comment on the speed, but it recorded and download pictures at blinding speed in my estimation. Fantastic value for the bucks."
2,Not as compatible as they say it is.,"I have wasted 2 trips to COSTCO to buy and return a 128mb compact flash card from Sandisk because none are compatible with my Casio BE-300. The package clearly states it is compatible with ALL cameras, mp3 players, handheld comp..etc. but the web site has the actual compatibility list - go there first."
4,Drawbacks,The only hang-up with the CF Card is to remember to flip the card around when inserting it between the Compact Card Reader and the Camera itself to avoid damage to a Card when reinstaling it into either device.Once properly inserted the playback access time is super and the write time when recording is great.
2,Poor Service,Ordered the SanDisk 256 MB card for my NIKON Coolpix 5000. Card worked fine for 6 mos and then stopped working right after Christmas. I called for a warranty replacement (it's guarenteed for 5 yrs or so they say per written warranty)and then the runaround began. They close for the Christmas Holidays for 10 days. NO ONE is available to issue an RMA for a replacement? Finally after numerous calls I got an RMA# and sent the faulty card back per their instructions. Now I can't find out anything about the replacement card as they just don't seem to be able to get back to me with the status of the replacement card. Over a month and no replacement card. Stuck using the camera included card of 32 MB capacity. I would not reccommend this company to anyone. Customer support is terrible. Their promises to contact me about warranty issues is very poor. Caveat emptor. I will now go to Viking. SanDisk just doesn't seem to care.
1,P.O.S.,"Okay, I just bought one of these. Then I proceeded to go on a 6 mile walking tour all over San Francisco taking shots all alongthe way with my new Digital Rebel...everything seemed fine...until I got home and tried to view them on my computer...CF Card Error...then I put the same card back in the camera...Err CF...it's unbelievable the effort I put into getting thoseshots and they're ALL LOST...I'd give it ZERO stars if that were an option."
4,worth the money,"THese dolls can be pricey but they are beautiful doll. She has an authentic look that my daughter responded well to! Soft body and molded face and hands, she is a keeper for many years!!!"
3,"A Fine Translation of Xenophon's ""Hellenica""","Rex Warner's translation of Xenophon's ""Hellenica"" is quite enjoyable. However, the problem lies with Xenophon's writing. Allegedly a continuation of Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War, it is really more of a memoir recounting Spartan triumphs and failures during the period of 400 to 365 BC. Indeed, it should be regarded mainly as Xenophon's apologia on behalf of his Spartan patron, the king Agesilaus. As such it is often plodding reading. It is certainly not as riveting as Xenophon's ""Anabasis"". Yet those interested in Greek history during this time may find it rewarding."
2,Then... why not Diodorus?,"After reading Mr. Warner's introduction to Xenophon's ""History of My Times"" there was only one thought in my mind: if Xenophon is so bad a Greek historian (he is indeed; it just takes a few pages to see it) compared to Diodorus Siculus, then why has Penguin Books not published an affordable edition of the latter's account of Greek history? The only one available out there, if I'm correct, is a bilingual (Greek-English) edition by Loeb Classical Library which costs almost $30 with tax. Hey Penguin guys out there... Are you interested in making some money?"
1,"SOunds good to me, Squash N Squeak","Waste of money. The worst though about TRL, however, is that ""The Bad Touch"" was probally on this. Leave that song to the real Bloodhound Gang fans, and dont' let the Bad Touch ever be listened to by teenyboppers or MTV watchers."
2,Scam!,"Like the other reviewer, one of my favorite shows that I can never miss, is MTV's TRL. Carson Daly is by far one of the funniest, and wittiest guys on TV in general. You can imagine my disappointment when I heard the annoyance of Brian McFayden's voice for the game. You make a TRL game, and you can't even use the real star of the show...how lame is that!"
4,Slow start with a great ending,"The hero of the story, Ian, is one that almost anyone can relate to. Even though he has special abilities, they aren't so out of the normal that you feel he has an advantage in life.A well written novel, with an almost classic feel to the reading. The story does develope the characters quite well, without over doing it. Some of the character's styles of speech get old, and is a bit much at times. Still the book was a great read, and will provide enjoyment for me in the future. Cannot wait for the next one. If you like this one, read ""David and the Phoenix"", by Edward Ormondroyd. An old classic newely reprinted!!!"
1,Waste of Time and Money,This product is a total waste of time and money. The motor burnt on its first use. Customer support is non exsistent I tried to contact them but to no avail well I lost my money.Amazon will not assist because it was not sold by them. The reviews on Amazon were very misleading. Customeers indicated that Mc Culloh is built by Ryobi but I hardly think so. My previous unit was made by Ryobi and it lasted aproximately 6 years.This unit lasted 6 minutes.
2,Choppy writing; not much insight.,"I was disappointed in this book for several reasons. The sentences were choppy and the stories lacked realism--they didn't bring me close to the people the way other similar anthologies have. Then, the majority of the stories were about women who were marrying in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. As a 29 year old woman, I've been wondering why it's so hard to find the stories of younger women. I skimmed most of the book and don't see myself picking it back up any time soon."
3,"Good, Straightforward Explanation of the Battle","Chancellorsville tells the story of the Civil War battle in clear, easy-to-understand language that the average person can understand. It's a nice history for those who don't need to have every detail of every military unit's movement, who just want a straight telling of what happened. Briskly told, the author refrains from getting too far into pop psychology in interpreting the people involved, as can happen with newer histories of the Civil War. All in all, I would recommend this book for anyone who just want a general knowledge of the battle. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on Squidoo."
3,Good for what it is,"Do not buy this book, as I did, if you are looking for a thoughtful scholarly discussion of baroque ornamentation. That, it is not. It also has little, if anything, to say about ornamentation for non-keyboard instruments.For what it is, however, it's not a bad book. If you are an intermediate keyboard player (or a keyboard teacher shopping for an intermediate keyboard player), I can recommend this with slight reservation. While it doesn't offer an interested student much insight into the Baroque psychology that generated this style of ornamentation, it does provide a reliable (if very basic and somewhat superficial) introduction to specific ornamentation in baroque and classical keyboard music, so it would be good for a piano or harpsichord student who is just being introduced to the Bach two-part inventions or simple preludes."
4,A good challenge for puzzle lovers,I give this to my father for present he give me an amazed impression on his face when looked out and now it's pleased and anxious to start it. the size of the box and quality of pieces looks really good.
5,A magical story told in a readable way,"This translation of the Odyssey is one of the best I've ever read, and as a graduate of a classical civilizations degree program, I have had experience with a great many different translations. The wonder and magic of this classic myth are expressed in beautiful language that is remarkably easy to read. The story is conveyed without the poetic langauge being mauled, and without the language itself getting in the way of the tale. I find it encouraging that a young reader found the story ""disgusting"" and ""gory"". The tale is indeed both gory and violent. With so many translations, however, the adventure is lost because the reader becomes tangled in a maze of archaic language and puzzling prose techniques designed to mimic the Greek. Kudos to Fagles for bringing The Odyssey back to the people!"
1,"Not the translation advertised on website; by Butler, not Fagles","This may be a fabulous version translated by some guy named Butler. My son needed the Fagles translation for school. The description lists Fagles and some of the reviews were for Fagles. Very confusing. Now he is having to use a library and sticky notes for annotation. After getting the wrong book, I found several other reviews that noted the same problem. So- be extra cautious if your teacher is picky about the version."
4,Better Than I Thought it Would Be,"It's a classic. It was much easier to understand than I thought it would be. All the extra helps we're just that--helps. The Introduction, though long, was a great guide. I constantly used the Pronouncing Glossary to remind me who the mortals and immortals were and their relationship to one another. The poetic words were a delight."
5,"poetic, timeless, true","This reads so well. It is the best translation I have read of Homer.My Homeric Greek is really quite rusty... but this fine translation gives you a sense of the irresistible flow of the original.Reading it makes you feel really solidly embedded in that ancient world. The characters - gods, legendary heroes, psychotic murderers and monsters... somehow, although they are mythical and removed from the mundane ""real"" world - come across as real. You can still recognize them.The timeless themes and rock solid plot are endlessly appealing."
4,The Odyssey of the Ego,"I have loved this book since I first read it in 1995! People who like poetry will easily fall into the enchanting spell of the Fagle's version of Homer's classic tale of one man's journey to return to the wife and child he left 10 yrs. ago. I'll admit, the main character, Odysseus, lacks some philosophical morals, but if you spent twenty yrs. of your life without your family, raging war and sailing at sea, you'd probably begin to unwind from your natural self. Odysseus is by no means a great man, he's a chauvinist, a merciless tyrant, and a bit of a selfish egotist, but hey, the word 'I' in Ancient Greek is Ego, so go figure. Homer created realisitic characters, and timeless quests in one of the greatest books of all time."
2,"Great story, horrible translation","As a scholar of Homeric Greek I would avoid this translation at all costs. It may be very well written as far as narrative ease is concerned, but it absolutely doesn't follow the original text in either wording or meaning."
3,Couldn't use,There were too many annotations in this book. I couldn't even read it. I could have used am erasure if it was written in pencil.
4,THE ODYSSEY IS FANTASY OR REALITY,"The odyssey is a story that talks about the gods greeks and the life of Odysseus. Odysseus is sent to the war but he did want to go to war. He pretended he was crazy to stay with his family, but they threaten his son and he decided to go. The Odyssey teacher courage, love, and teacher how to deal with all the trouble you can think of."
1,CD didn't work,The CD arrived without a case. The product description did not mention there was no case. It didn't play at all. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Not even a skip. I tried it in two other CD players: Same problem.
2,Save me from The Odyssey!,"Although it may seem intriguing, this book can drive one to the brink of insanity. Forcrd to analyze this book eveyday while reading it, taking out the trash is a more perferred exercise. A warning: If you have the time to read about 300 pages of filth, then 20 of quality literature I would recomend The Odyssey!"
3,i was excited about reading the story at first,"but then it seemed to drag. i really didn't like the story, maybe that opinion was influenced by my not like odyssesus. i don't know. i fail to see the beauty of the story. sophacles was a much better storyteller."
3,A decent adventure story,"I enjoyed reading this story, yet I think much of its acclaim comes from its age. At times it does seem to ramble a bit. My fervent suggestion to those contemplating this is make sure you get a translation appropriate to your purpose. I was only interested in the story of it so I made sure my copy was translated in plain English. As it turns out, many are written in verse which I think would make it near impossible to read to the end."
3,Good but dull,I feel like I heard this story many times before. Not cutting edge. Lots of interesting characters though. Unreallistic platitudes as they relate to the human condition.Homer has a lot of growing up to do.
2,It's an adventure reading this book,"The plot of ""The Odyssey"" is very good- Odysseus, the hero, wants to come home for the first time in 20 years, while his son looks for him. Had this been written by a present-day author, this story would be better developed than what it was by Homer at the dawn of time. You never really get to feel good or bad about Odysseus' character, and the only one you do feel sorry for is Penelopia, his faithful wife who must choose to keep her promise and marry someone else, or stay faithfulto Odysseus. This is a good lesson in mythology, but not an easy read at all."
3,the odyssey a interesting book,"the odyssey is a interesting book. i did like that book because the experiences that odysseus pass in those 20 years, that he fight with cyclopes, and others monsters that was my favorite part. i think thatn i will read that book thousands of time because it talk about problemsthat people have in life and a normal person have."
4,excelent translation,"i have read several translations of the iliad and the odyssey i have found fagles' work has a ring to it that allows both clear understanding with a certain poetic style. no expert i, i just know what i like and i like fagles' work."
4,Excellent!,"Do your self a favor, and read one of the most important books in all of Western literature. The fantasy lands that Odysseus encounters will keep you riveted. Furthermore, the love element in the book is very touching."
1,Amazon.com's listings for Homer get no stars!,"This is a review of your listings for ""Homer"": they are in excreble condition compared to your otherwise well-constructed listing/bibliographies. Someone at your organization really ought to review and thoroughly revise this category (Homer/Odyssey etc. Thanks.If there is another way to contact you with a point of view, please revise."
2,To each his own,"Personally, I thought that this book was extrememly boring. I had to read it in school and I didn't understand it at all. The words were very confusing and the plot had so many different aspects that it was hard for me to keep up. However, if you are a person that likes action and fighting scenes, then I am sure that you would love this book. Many of the guys in my class loved it becuase of the fight scenes. It all just depends on what type of novel you enjoy."
4,I dont remember nothing,I liked this book because I think that this book has a lot of action and is contains some adventure too. And I recommend this because it make you think a lot about how wonderful life is.
5,"Homer's Odyssey, As it was meant to be","Whether you love Homer's Odyssey, or have yet to discover its magic, this full-length recording of Robert Fagles' brilliant translation is the way it should be enjoyed. Ian McKellan is in full, majestic voice as he recites Homer's great saga, modulating his pitch and tone just enough to create the dozens of characters - gods and mortals - which people the tale. The Odyssey started out just this way, as an oral performance by a gifted teller of tales, and it comes vividly to life in this modern version. This is simply not to be missed."
5,Fundemental Literture in the Form it Was Meant,"For thousands of years this story has been told and retold.The reason this story is still being told and still being heard is because it is so exciting and so very compelling.It never grows old.I have read and enjoyed this story from a leather bound book, but it is best heard spoken from a human voice. Ian McKellen is qualified as a modern day bard.Unlike most movies and books of today, once will not be enough.Those who listen to it will not be disappointed."
2,Bait and switch,"I like both Fagle's and Pope's translations,depending on mood. However, I was dismayed when I clicked on the Kindle link in Fagle and got Pope's verse translation. Buyer beware, and shame on Amazon!"
1,This is NOT the Fagles translation (Amazon page for this product is currently misleading),"Unfortuantely, the product that ships for this description (and this cover) is a translation by Samuel Butler. I am very disappointed."
3,Fagles is not the translator to read,"Yes, the Odyssey is a magnificent book; I am shocked at the effusive praise for Fagles' translation, however. The best that can be said is that (a) his translation is not too different from those of his superiors, ie Lattimore and Fitzgerald and (b) he doesn't obscure Homer's timeless achievement too much. But there is a distinct whiff of what Nabokov called ""poshlost"" in Fagle's translation--a sort of suburban vulgarity, with its anacronisms (eg ""Scot-free"") and casual slang. The Fagle translation's instant reputation, will, I am sure, fade away quickly, just another fleeting illusion successfully created by the modern American media's hype machine. Read the Lattimore and Fitzgerald translations, both of which are available from Amazon."
4,excellent translation,"Like the Iliad, Fagles presents this wonderful work in English, perhaps as well as it can be. Perhaps, the most telling review, is that I have presented both this and the Iliad to a fourteen year-old boy who despises reading, and he found himself instantly addicted and began putting off his nightly cartoons for Homer. Furthermore, it has caused him to start thinking about right and wrong. Not just what feels good. If there is a better review, I don't know what is."
5,It started with Homer,"One of the pillars of Western Civilization, Homer's The Odyssey and The Iliad (his other work) are must reads. The Odyssey is a brilliant look at a man's journey in life and in an era when honor was paramount. The Fagles edition is easy to read for the modern reader. You can always make arguments about translation, but this one a strong one especially if it's your first venture into the classics.There is also public domain ones available for free and that's great to try it out before buying."
4,The Great Oddysey,"This book was very cool because you can learn a lot from it and I also recommended it because is one of the most important books, and a story with a lot of imagination, adventure, and ideas of the real world so I would really like you to read it and learn about the ideas that people had in the past, and then try to recommended to another people and see how the characters, the setting, plot and the theme this book has are fantastic. This book is one of the most adventurous and mythological epic stories."
3,"A classic, yet not quite up to par","I REALLY wish I could say that I enjoyed this book, but I can't. I wouldn't reccomend this book to hardly anyone. Only read this book if you're a fan of intricate plots and long, oftentimes boring, narratives. When a character would start making a speach, often I would read and lose all intrest to the point where it just wasn't fun or stimulating. The plot is great, and the actual story is quite interesting, yet the way in which it is told is dull and drawn-out. If you want to read this, go ahead. But if you're not too interested, I wouldn't even take it off the shelf."
4,"Good purchase, but long time for delivery","I already gave up on receiving the item - and then, weeks after the purchase - it arrived... well the item is in good condition and as discribed. Thanks."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"This book had been recommended to me so I decided to read it. It is the worst, no exaggeration, book that I have ever read. It was totally incomprehensible. The plot was not even interesting! If you are sitting there trying to figure out what each character is saying, it's not easy to find the book enjoyable! I do NOT recommend this book to anyone; young or old!"
1,This is SICK!!!,"I thought this story was very gross. I mean come on. We are having to read this book in freshman English. Actually our teacher reads it to us, but it is still disgusting. We are also having to watch the movie of this, talk about gruesome. It's like Scylla comes out of the water and chomps these people out of the ship and blood showers everywhere. I almost threw up every day when we watch this movie. We watch a little each day. I am over there about to puke up my toes and everybody else, all the boys anyway, are saying how cool it is. My boyfriend just laughs when I tell him I almost threw up in there, he is a freshman, so he has to watch it also. I'm sure he thinks it is awesome,but I don't. If you really like gory stories you will like it. If you don't then I wouldn't read it or watch the movie if I were you. I am not saying to listen to me, you can have your own opinion, I'm just saying I don't like it."
1,What on earth?,"Giving this book one star was very gracious, it deserves -2 stars. There is no other word than awful. For school, we had to read this book, and I was kind of excited, I think Greek Mythology is very interesting. I knew that it would be somewhat of a challange, knowing it was poetry and since it was assigned in my Honors English class. Now that we are done with the book, I am forced to write a 5 page paper on it. All that I can possibly say is that it bored me and I could not even finish it, because it was not written a way that you could understand it. I am warning you if you like to waste your time you should read this book, otherwise stay clear!"
5,look for the silver lining,"The first purchase I made from Amazon.com and I was so happy both with the delivery(very quick) and also with the film I just rate as 'wonderful' although I have this on vhs, I have searched for a very long time for it on dvd,it is a very lovely musical, one of my all time favourites, and anyone who enjoys 'older' musicals will certainly enjoy this, you really feel like a part of this musical 'family'its just so lovely, It is a film to watch over time and again, and although it was made in,I think 1949, its still as fresh and entertaining today, as I remember it from years ago.Thank you so much for both having this in stock, and once again for your speedy delivery."
3,Good performances for this movie,"This is June Haver movie and she is good, but Ray Bolger (Wizard of OZ) stole the show. Gordon Macrae was hansome and good but not in the movie for long. The story is about Marilyn Miller famous Broadway actress. I give it 3 stars. Entertaing."
3,A musical biography of the career of Marilyn Miller,"This is a simplified and ""sweetened"" musical biography of early Broadway star Marilyn Miller, featuring June Haver in the title role, and nicely supported by Ray Bolger and Gordon MacRae. Except for Bolger's fine dancing, I thought most of the musical numbers were only of average quality. Haver does a great deal of dancing, but nothing exceptional, and MacRae is not given an opportunity to really show off his tremendous voice; the two times he has a potentially nice number to sing, he is interrupted by Haver either talking to him or dancing. Still, it is an entertaining movie and fine for the whole family."
1,Look for the Silver Lining,I cannot view this movie on my system. I have asked many times when purchasing to ensure your products are suitable for Australia. Most of the time they are NOT. Returning them is such a hassle. I just throw them away. What a waste!!
1,Look for the Silver Lining,"For some reason I cannot get this to play in our DVD machine. It says loading and just keeps on with the loading. I can play with my PC though, so I decided to just keep and not go through the hassle of returning. This is the first time I have had this problem with a DVD. That's too bad because we do enjoy the old musicals. Rating is due to not being able to play in our DVD machine."
4,Makes sense - finally an eating plan for WOMEN!!,I have some questions and was disappointed that the web site and phone number do not exist. Has the publisher contacted the author about this probelm? Having studies showing the difference in dieting men v. women is great. It's about time! Cant' wait to start it. Has anyone found the Good Calorie products in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area or a national grocery store chain? Good luck everyone!
1,More wishfull thinking than scientific evidence.,"I found that often the information in this book contradicted common sense, and once in a while, even his own information. The diet is very restrictive, especially for a lifelong diet program. His whole evolutionary explanation for the diet is bunk. Of course, it is healthier than the typical American diet, which is why people feel better on it."
3,Is there a website? Tell me where.,"I haven't started this diet yet, but am going to make it this years ""New Years"" diet. Once again, new year, new diet. On a positive note: I was surprised in the first chapter how much I can relate to the descriptions of dieting caused anxiety and mood swings, boy, does that sound like me. I do wish that I had the e-mail address to order food products, or perhaps the food products never materialized. Any luck in that department? PLEASE let me know!!"
4,Good Value,"You may not use all of the designs; however, at this price, who cares. The patterns are easy to sew and are easy to transfer. Good combination of styles. This book has something for any beginner."
4,Traditional,This book is full of traditional mostly border designs. Very well-written directions. Can't wait to try them out.
4,60 Machine Quilting Patterns,"The patterns are wonderful,they are just what a person is looking for to make a template from for quilting. They are just what I was looking for.When it come to quilting patterns for a quilt top it is hard not to find what your looking for, you will find that you will use this book over and over again.Thanks so much for looking"
2,decent value for price,"Nothing continuous offered here, although a few could be altered. I would say a good purchase for a quilter without much reference yet and looking for quilting designs."
2,What God has to do with it ?,"What God has to do with it ? It s a shame we re still fighting in His name .I ve seen the reaction of the Enola [...] crew when they really saw what they did.The motive for Fussell's Te Deum is that he was among those enlisted to take part in the invasion of Japan, and he might have been killed .Although a still useful book to understand the way people thought ( sometimes I think they still do )in the past , it s not worth the time if you re not a historian .It s a bit shameful point trying to justify killing Japanese women and children. In the first place he'd better criticise those in Washington who conscripted him to fight.Remember all wars are only fought in people's name and they put God as a disguise. Whatever god they must pray to but isn t surely in their hearts but in their pockets."
1,Offensive and Cheesy...the worst of the worst,"So, if the shoe were on the other foot would it be acceptable? Let's see: ""Piss on Satan"" or ""Lucifer: Stupid Idiot""...or....""Lamebrain: The Devil's Saga""..........yes, all cheesy titles and offensive, too.Don't waste your money or your soul on this trash. Turn to God......He ACTUALLY loves you...."
1,I pray that the Lord has mercy on all your souls!!,I pray that the Lord has mercy on all your souls!!whether you believe in him or not you will have to face him on judgement day and you will see if you're going to heaven or hell. I rather be shour I'm going to heaven.Revelation 16:1111 And they said evil things against the God of heaven because of their pain and their wounds; and they were not turned from their evil works.Exodus 20:77 You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord
1,He wasn't very good in bed!,"Jesus wasn't very good in bed. He kept talking about saving the world and how BIG he was, so I hate this one."
1,Bad bad bad,"Like the title says its horrifying, I cant believe someone would put a record out like that, who gave these guys a record deal, awful just awful, I don't even satan would listen to this. Wish I could give this -5 stars"
5,REAL EVIL,This guys rule as it is. Marduk's former vocalist Legion had probably the best black metal voice next to Abbath from immortal. This album has a good collection of what are some of their best songs. If you don't have this album get it just because of the title.
4,Pretty Good,"This cream is really good at moisturizing and works generally well as a day-to-day sunscreen. Would need something stronger if you were outside all day or in a tropical area. My only concern is that if you look closely, it has little sparkles in it - that's what gives you the 'glow' it mentions - and I don't like the idea of covering my fresh-washed face in glitter."
3,I am divided on this product.,"I have used this product at least once daily for the past 3 months.It keeps my skin comfortable throughout the day and I really like the spf. I even use it on my bikini area and stomach when I lay in the sun because I am sensitive to many suntan lotions.BUT when I apply it, it feels like its scratching me (and not in an exfoliating way) and it has glitter in it! I guess that's the ""glow."" That wouldn't bother me so much in body lotions but ever since I switched to this moisturizer, I've been having more breakouts, which I might attribute to the shimmery stuff, or whatever is scratching my face.Today I switched to the C&C; dual action moisturizer in hopes that it will reverse the breakout patter that ""morning glow"" has caused.So far, it feels good to put on, its just as comfortable throughout the day, but I don't like that it has no spf."
5,Love it!,"I was looking for a new facial moisturizer. I have combination skin so it's difficult to find one that goes on evenly. This is further complicated by how dry parts of my skin gets in the winter months. I tried out Clean & Clear morning glow moisturizer since it had an SPF-15 and would moisturize the dry parts of my skin while not going on heavily or greasily on the oily acne-prone parts. I was delighted when this moisturizer revitalized my face and neck, while protecting against sun damage. In the winter, my skin does still dry out in places, but I use this moisturizer in combination with a tinted moisturizer from Wet n' Wild:Wet 'n' Wild Ultimate Sheer Tinted Moisturizer, SPF 15, Sun Kissed 183, 1 oz.and it works perfectly.Wonderfully scented. I LOVE the dispenser!!!!!"
2,Made me break out,"It says oil free, but with my crazy sensitive/combination skin, I should have known better.I've been using this moisturizer on my arms, shoulders, etc. for some light sun protection though so not all is lost."
3,Good if used in moderation,"My skin dries out horribly during the winter months and can get rather flaky. I recently purchased Clean and Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer and am very satisfied with it. I've tried plenty of other moisturizers out there and found they are waaaaay too thick for my skin.Clean and Clear Morning Glow is by far the best.It's thinner than most moisturizers out there (as long as you use it sparingly), so it won't leave your skin feeling like you just slathered a bunch of grease all over it. It's oil free so you don't have to worry about it clogging your pores and it also has SPF 15, which is a great addition since it's always a good idea to protect your skin from the harmful uv rays of the sun (summer AND winter).It has slight citrus smell, which in my opinion smells great and compared to other moisturizers on the market, is considerably cheaper (price varies by store, but is usually around $5).It makes my skin feel fresher, brighter, moisturized and alive."
2,Made me break out,I should have known that this product would make me break out. The scent is extremely strong. People with sensitive skin should avoid this product. I ordered 3 bottles of this lotion based on the reviews. I gave the lotion to my insensitive friends and they love it:)
5,GREAT PRODUCT,i was a bit skeptical...as usual with any lotion. i find any one that is at a reasonable price and spells good is usually oily and irritates my skin.with this i was happy to find its moisturizing and doesn't leave oil residue on my skin. oh and even though the SPF is only 15...for day to day use it does the trick. haven't burnt yet and its been a scorching summer!
4,Hard to find at this time but worth the wait...,"Not out en mass yet so it was difficult to obtain one for my PDA (which is also new). Light, clearly a boost to memory space on my PDA, it is something you won't be able to do without if you have large programs that require lots of memory (for instance, I run a few large medically related programs on my PDA which have a huge memory burden). I was worried about backward compatibility since my PDA only recommended SD cards as large as 16 MB but it proved to be of no concern as the device I have recognizes the card and all of its memory space. Of course, expense is a concern but I'm sure that will come down in the near future as well since this media type is proving to become an industry standard. Get one! (unless you can wait for the 128 MB cards to show up)."
1,terrible,"no deberian ofrecer productos que ya no se usan tecnologicamente hablando y que pueden causar confusion, lo compre pensando que eran GB (no MB). Terribleterribleshould not offer products that are no longer used technologically speaking and that can cause confusion, buy it thinking they were GB (not MB). terrible"
1,Tricked,The heading tricked me into thinking it was a 64 gig on black Friday. I take the blame and I am keeping it. It cannot even store one picture on my 14 megapixel camera.
5,San Disk Smart Media***,"I love San Disk Products! Their smart media cards are the best. They are very reliable and I have never received a faulty card. You can use them over and over... I like the 64MB size, it's perfect to take on trips and holds a nice amount of pictures. The price has really dropped in the last six months. I just purchased my fourth card. If your looking for smart media, stick with the brands you know and trust."
1,corrupt memory,The 64 MB MMC card from SanDisk seems to have file problem when I attempt to use this with Intel Personal Audio 3000 (MP3 player). Intel site states that problem is with memory card not with player. I have confirmed problem with all four cards I purchased. Would caution all buyers of this product until specific problem found and corrected.
1,Incompatible with the Zaurus,"This card simply does not work with the Sharp Zaurus. Sharp has released an update to the ROM which improves the compability (they don't actually say it fixes the problem); but, in order to install ROM updates, you need a CompactFlash card. If you've got a CF card, then this SD card might be worth a try; but I wasn't willing to spend [money] for a 16M CF card in order to get a [$$$] SD card to work."
4,Concerning Access Speeds,"Admittedly, I have a Panasonic SD card but what I have to say is relevant to all SD cards. My card is 16MB and has about 3 or 4MB of photos on it. When I use Photo Suite to access these files on my Palm M505 it takes 15 seconds to list all the photos on them. Also, video playback is slow but watchable. (On an MMC card video playback is VERY slow.) Once they are listed though it only takes a second or two to view the picture. If the other reviewers are correct in what they are saying then indeed it would seem access times are greater for this SD card. Then again one has to take into consideration what PDA they have. My Palm M505 is a toroise compared to pocket PCs."
3,"Once Again, Viking is Less Expensive","Why is Viking always less expensive than SanDisk? I have been closely monitoring the flash pricing for the past month and I haven't found an instance yet that the Viking card is not at least a few dollars less. In some cases they offer a 33% savings in comparison to the SanDisk equivalent product.According to the dozens of reviews, the cards both seem to operate flawlessly. Since there is no difference in quality (and actually most of the reviews will state that Viking has better service), I took the plunge with a Viking card.I rated this card 3 stars because of SanDisk's reputation for high quality, but the lack of a competitive price."
1,Wrong item,"As you can tell from the photograph, what you sent me was wrong. What you sent me is the cargo liner that goes into the storage space that the third seat creates when stored. In other words the liner for the storage area underneath the third seat. You did not send the liner (as pictured) that covers the area between the back of the second row seats to and over the stored third seats and extends on to the rear of the vehilce. Note: see the picture. Bottom line is you sent me the wrong thing twice (two times). There is obviously a problem that exist between what you advertise and what you actually sell. I sure you would agree with me this type of poor communication in selling makes for bad business relationships. Whose mistake it is has yet to be determined by anyone at your staff or the product provider. I would appreciate attention to his matter and some type of feed back related thereto. Thank you."
4,An answer to the Left Behind series.,"Mr Wohlberg has written a book that clearly exposes the errors of the Left Behind fictional books and movie.He shows that there is no pre-trib rapture.It's not a secret rapture either.Reading this book has led me to consider the historicist view as opposed to the futurist view of Revelation.Reading the Bible in context and studying Daniel(7:25 in particular)with Revelation from a historical standpoint confirms for me that Mr. Wohlberg may be ""on point"" with this book.He has taken apart the the theories of the Left Behind series without slandering the evangelists behind the books and all the while basing his theory on the Bible!"
2,Unrealised,"This had potential, good name, good packaging, decent sound and with Andy La Rocque on guitars, but it falls into an industro syncopated kind of nothing music rather than any of the band member's traditional strengths. I was hoping for some King Diamond like material with a 'normal' vocalist, but this seems like it is more of a Snowy Shaw (drums) project as he writes at least half the songs and it shows.The vocals are...varied, sorta germanic/swedish accented shouts and shrieks, but with a couple of songs showing some good vocal melodies similar to Rob Halford, but not as strong.A couple of reviews have compare this to halford's Fight project, and as god awfull as that was (from what I heard on the radio at the time), Illwill is along those lines, chaotic crunchy groove noise.Not really worthy, but I can say there are 3 good songs on this. They need to wear more clothes and try harder."
2,Too much work,"I didn't know you would have to hold down the button while in use, which makes for more work than it's worth. It definitely takes away from the 'pleasurable' experience."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I was looking for a true Turkish Apple Tea. Found this when I searched and hoped even though it said herbal apple tea that some of the Turkish Apple Tea taste would be there since it also said product of Turkey. Neither my husband or I could taste any apple flavor---we even tried using two tea bags per cup. Can't say it is a bad tea as it may be standard for a herbal tea but just not what I would consider an apple tea. The two star rating was for ""I don't like it"" but this is one of those items where personal taste differs from person to person. IF you are looking for Apple Tea as served in Turkey this is not the one you want."
2,Show me the money!,"Have you noticed that 99% of the time, technical analysis authors never backtest the systems they are writing about (or if they do they never reveal the results) ? This book is no exception. Well I am sick and tired of that nonsense! Where is the PROOF that the systems are profitable? How many pips profit (if any!) will the system generate per month on average? What is the worst drawdown? None of these issues are addressed in the book, even though it would take only minutes to backtest most of the techniques (setups as the author calls them) using software like Omega Trade Station!In other words we are supposed to trade the systems presented in the book (and risk our hard-earned money) without even knowing if they are profitable or not in the long run.I am not saying that this book is worthless, I just want the PROOF that these forex systems are indeed profitable and do not generate huge drawdowns in the process."
2,A lot of filler. An intro to forex book.,"You have to wait till chapter 10 before you see something unique to the book. The other chapters are spent talking about what you can read up on most forex websites. The last two chapters 9&10 are spent on know thy self, analysis, setups and strategy. The setups/analysis is mainly based on bollinger bands. Not exactly keen on Bollinger bands, so my interest was nil. If you are a complete beginner to forex, this book may be useful..maybe."
3,Forex market book review,"Forex market is the largest financial market today.This book is focused on technical analysis and while it has chapters on setups and on trend following ideas it still is far beyond what is a holy grail in forex market trading.Overall a good but not great book,not for beginners but for intermediary levels in forex trading.http://www.themoneyblog.euhttp://www.theinternetbusinessblog.com"
2,Not what I was expecting,I was expecting more elaborate more detail more specifics on Technical Analysis. I was dissapointed as this book just barely scrathes the surface.
5,useful,This is a very good practical book on anger management for all age groups. It is higly recommended for therapists
5,Great meter set for the price,"Yes, you can get more complete kits with more functionality, but this kit is missing nothing that you need and has a really good fit and finish at an appropriate price. The LCD does wash-out at an angle a bit, but not a big problem, really. Just don't view it off-angle. Very highly recommend. Great all around kit."
3,History of HCIL???,"I have met and attended many lectures by both Bens and believe they both have and still have many contributions to HCI. This book is not one of them, as I was suprised at the poor printing quality of this book. Many figures are unreadable, and make many references to the same project, (i.e. Spotfire)throughout many of the papers. The main reason for purchasing this book was to have one place to look for varied theories, methods or appliactions of information visualization. You may be better served by locating papers on this subject via the web and creating a collection of you own."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was hoping for a clear acrylic letter tray but most of this tray was frosted so didn't have the look I was hoping for. ""Similar to the one pictured"" (except side loading)? and ""like new""? Not so much since ther were scratches on the plastic and tape residue that could not be removed, but as an infrequent buyer on this site it was my mistake for not requesting an exact picture of what I was being sent...live and learn."
4,Black Russian Terrier,"This book is pretty thorough. It not only explains the origin of the Black Russian Terrier breed, but it also addresses the temperament and character of the breed. This publication is much more than a ""how to care for your new puppy"" book, although it is basic enough for new owners. The book not only describes the benefits of owning a BRT, but also responsibly stresses why this strong-willed breed of dog is not for everyone, and tells why that is so. The author seems to have touched on every subject concerning the BRT, from coat care and nutrition to housebreaking, socialization and bloat. I didn't care for their unrealistic advice to visit the mom and pop of a litter, because this is still such a rare breed that Americans are still importing these scarce dogs from Russia. However, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of being, or already is, owned by a Black Russian Terrier."
4,On the Mark,"This is a rare breed with a fascinating history, unique temperament and a great dog. But it can be very hard to find clear, concise information on this breed and this book is just that. Well worth the small investment for any one considering this breed."
5,Black Russian Terrier,I purchased this book for my son that lives in the Netherlands. He and his girlfriend just got a Black Russian Terrior and I thought this would be handy for them both to learn more about this breed of dog. Thank you.
2,B & B Plates,"The order was processed and delivered on time. There was confusion on either my part and/or the order entry blocks. There were 6 plates ordered. The Amazon shopping list indicated the plates came in packs of 5 but single plates could be ordered. The plates were shipped in 6 different boxes and, according to the recepient, each box was the size of a small television carton."
3,Alot Of Material Here!,This book begins with a look into Tolkien's books and the relationships to distant history. Information and the process of the author's thoughts drift to linking the Ring lord culture into a roller coaster ride through almost every distant european and middle eastern culture. Lots of this material is well presented and factual. Some is also conjecture on the author's behalf. All is well presented and adventureous to read.
5,WOW! What a book!!!,"That book was great, suspence on every page. Normally I hate mysteries but this book really got me hooked; a must read for mystery lovers and haters alike."
3,Paperquake,I think that this is a fantasic book it is about a girl that is a unidenical member of a set of triplets. I can deffenty relate to this book because this is how I feel somtimes in my family! This book is sooo.. good! It's great for a warm day at the beach or for a rainy day!
5,Reiss Strikes Again,"This was not the first Kathryn Reiss book I have read, but by far one of the best. Their were endless kinks in the plot, which really made you keep reading because anything could happen. The end o and fimal climax is completely invisible from the begining of the book. This is a must read for anyone interested in fantasy, intruige, and a bit of history."
1,Full of Errors - Confirmed!!!,"I stongly encourage you not to order this book! It is full of errors. One problem contained three errors!! While the problem statements are worthwhile and very typical of the types of questions you will see on the exam, I spent a significant amount of time attempting to interpret the author's answers which were often erroneous. The book was so frustrating I didn't even complete it. I passed the test primarily because of my review using the Chemical Engineering Reference Manual - 5th Edition by Randall Robinson. I encourage all readers to base their studies for the PE exam on Robinson's book and avoid the frustration this book caused me."
2,Full of Errors!,"I've worked through the first 16 problems. So far, I've found errors in 5 of them. Units are often omitted from the solution sets, making them difficult to follow. Problem M7 contains numerical errors in the solution set. Problem M13 is a condenser problem that gives a condensation rate, but no cooling water data and asks you to calculate the amount of cooling water required. Problem M14 has dimensionless equation that turns out not to be dimensionless. Problems M15 and M16 ask you to do calculations for a heat exhanger with a ""hot"" fluid going in at 350F and coming out at 450F while the ""cold"" comes in at 300F and goes out at 310F. I haven't yet attempted the PE exam, so I can't say whether or not the example problems are relevant to it."
3,Chemical Engineers Study Guide,"The guide is at providing numerous example problems to work and practice. However, the first edition contains a frustrating amount of errors in the solutions. Some of the solutions contain typos, and several are just flat wrong. Also, the solutions don't contain any formulas, just numerics.... without UNITS. By simply adding the units the author would help folks like me who have forgotten some of the basics. Overall, I would recomend buying this book, but understand its limitations."
1,Better options exist,"This book is full of errors, and the sample problems have almost no units included. I would not recommed this book, go to NCEE web site for a better sample exam."
2,Two songs in one?,"The songs did not come together as I thought they would, as they do on the radio. Is there a way for this to happenwwithout paying for them again?"
3,Not as good as other versions,"I much preferred the Christopher Plummer version of The Tempest. I strongly recommend that for fans of the bard. It is a superb performance.The BBC version has a moldy and outdated feel to it. I also found the ultra-tight outfits to be distracting and unattractive.The Tempest is a great play and deserves a great performance. Not this BBC production, alas."
2,Uninspired,"Squeamish homophobes, be forewarned: this is the most homoerotic interpretation I've ever seen of this play.Warren Clarke's portrayal of the feral child molester, Caliban, was admirable, as was Nigel Hawthorne's drunken Stephano. I've seen more sympathetic and satisfying interpretations of the relationship between Propero and Ariel, though; and I've seen Prospero played with much more humorous sagacity. Still, it was entertaining."
1,Not Recommended,"This version of the play is not only boring (and Shakespeare should NOT be boring), but Ariel and the other sprites wear less than loin cloths -- along with sparkly body glitter. Their costumes, as well as their acting, are distracting and ridiculous.I would never show this to someone who didn't already love Shakespeare. They'd come away thinking he wrote boring, uninspired stories, with a dash of the inappropriately lewd and strange."
5,No complaints so far,I use it in my Olympus 3040Z without any problems. How else can one praise a memory card? :)
2,Works Fine - Grossly Overpriced,"It's a shame that just because Olympus camera stopped making these type of memory cards, that the people who want to sell theirs want so much. Sure the card works fine, but I could get 10G memory on Compact Flash, for what we have to pay for a 128MB card for an older camera. Next time, I'll buy my girlfriend a newer camera, rathern than another one of these cards. A Shame."
1,Do not buy this card,I recently purchased The SanDisk 128 Mb card for use with my Olympus C-3020. I have been plagued by card errors since I opened the box. On three seperate occasions I have lost valuable and irreplacable family photos that I have taken. I have never had problems with the supplied Olympus SmartMedia card or the Viking card that I have since purchased. All I can say is to be careful and always keep a back-up card with you.
3,Not that Bad,"Hello All. I bought this as one of my beginner books. Yes it is about his beliefs however it is a good reference book. I did find his charts very useful, and there is humor along the way. I think the worst author out there is Edian McCoy. I agree that some of the stuff he has no use for is stuff I will have use for but when reading there are books that have a few great chapter and a couple that stink. Too bad you cannot make a single out of the chapters that you you want. Like they do with CD Singles."
1,"Wicca, Wicca, wherefore art thou?","Well...what we seem to have here is a luke warm serving of something very odd. The author, a self proclaimed ""High Priest"" states that he can't figure out a use for the four basic tools of the Craft!! My immediate thought was, okay...then why are you writing a book!?Essentially the book struck me as a mesh of curious basic errors in the understanding of Wicca mixed with the author's own admitted vagueness as to his personal understanding of the keys within Wicca. However, I have to say it is the first of its kind for an author to present a book on what he doesn't know about the topic he is writing on! That alone makes this a very unique book."
3,Wiccan Belieft & Practices,"Got this as a gift. She didn't say she didn't like it, but she was more impressed with Scott Cunningham's books on the subject."
1,Never judge a book by its cover,"This book is typical of the poor quality that has become the standard for popular books on Wicca and Witchcraft. Its attempt at historical data is seriously flawed, which only serves to foster ignorance among beginners who trust an author to provide accurate material. In addition, the material contained in this book contradicts itself and for the most part is just more of the same nonsense that keeps getting cranked out.As the old saying goes, if you can't say anything positive then you shouldn't say anything, so let me say that the book cover is really good. Unfortunately, after that the book is pretty much a waste of time."
5,Cudos for Gary Cantrell,"For anyone learning the world of Wicca this is the most comprehensive book I've read so far, for both coven and solitary practice. Gary Cantrell writes in a very simple and concise form that is easy to understand and gives you the best overview of the many aspects relating to Wicca. Well worth adding to your library."
1,Nope...,"I felt Cantrell's book was pretty much a waste of time. I've read a lot of books on Wicca and this one has nothing new to say. What it did have to say was kind of weak, and I have to agree with the other critical reviews here.But, take heart, there are some good books out there on Wicca. It's just that this isn't one of them."
1,Decaf Wicca,"Here is more of the ""make it up as you go along"" variety of Wicca. As with most books written today on Wicca, the author mixes up a batch of ""instant Wicca lite"" and serves it with a big ladle. Today Wicca seems to be whatever anyone feels it is at any particular time of day. This ""blind leading the blind"" approach to Wicca is very puzzling, but seems to be what people want.So, if you don't really care what Wicca is truly about, and want just another idea whipped up in someone's backroom overnight, then this book is as ""good"" as any."
4,Good. :)+=,"I waited almost a year to read the sequel, and I was expecting something special. This book is good, but Humility is very worn out in this book and only gains her spirit back during the last 5 pages. The charaters were believable (though not always likeable.) If you've read the first book, read this one, even if it is just to find out what the hell happened. Be prepared, however, to want to slowly kill Arity."
5,Best thing since the cell phone,"Used to have a PDA in one pocket, a cell phone in the other with a pager on my belt and my mp3 playet in my top pocket. In a word it sucked big time.This got it all into one device, and my monthly bill went to $60.00.40 for the phone and 20 for data on Tmobile.Best thing I ever bought!!"
3,Beware - no GSM850 coverage!,"AT&T uses two frequencies for GSM service. Originally they only used GSM1900 but as the old analog and TDA 850 MHz networks are made obsolete they are being converted to GSM850. The SX56 supports GSM1900 (and GSM900 for roaming in Europe) but not the newer GSM850 service. As time goes on AT&T will enhance their GSM850 coverage but there are reports that they've done all they're going to do to improve GSM1900 coverage. So if you're lucky your service will be OK but if you have any signal issues with this phone it won't get any betterI have the TMobile version of this phone and it works well on the TMobile network since TMobile only uses GSM1900 across North America. But this SX56 version of the phone is sold ""locked"" to only operate on AT&T's network.This is a problem with many AT&T GSM phones but it's particularly an issue with the SX56 because there aren't any suitable replacements (yet) with comparable functionality that support GSM850."
4,Excellent Phone PDA Combo,"I love my sx56, I have taken it everywhere, snowboarding, skydiving, beach, everywhere. Mine has never broken, in fact it is the sturdiest cell phone I've ever owned. Once I upgraded it to the Windows Mobile 2003 OS it was even better. All the cool standard software was great. Plus I added the Microsoft Voice Command software and can make calls to all my outlook contacts by pushing one button and saying ""Call so and so home"", you don't even have to train or record the voice commands, it does it all by voice recognition!"
2,Clunky and not very functional,"This phone bills itself as ""international"" with two GSM bands, but on a recent trip to London and Dubai I could not get it to work at all and had to revert to my tri-band Sony Ericsson Ti68, so if you travel out of the USA think twice! Also, on weekends, I found the added size of the SX-56 needless and reverted to my smaller phone. Windows CE is less intuitive than the Palm OS - CE does not prompt for confirmation of entries, leaving you wondering if they were accepted. One great feature of the SX-56 is the speakerphone ability, not common in a handheld - but overall I would say stick with a Palm plus a small mobile phone."
4,Great phone - Miss the phone pad,"Terrific phone for business folks on the go. All the connectivity and apps you need in one hand. let me take that back. you actually do need 2 hands for perfect performance. That is the only thing I do miss. But am willing to sacrifice due to the great display.Was lost in Jersey last week, connected to internet, found directions and phone to the location, made the call and then was able to jot down notes.Hopefully with Cingular trying to acquire ATT it will speed up the improvement of the GSM service coverage. As you all know ATT is spotty, when the coverage is good it is good when it ain't it is horrible.Would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to eliminate their PDA, synch with outlook, and access email/internet while on the go.Would have been 5 stars if ATT service was better. But let's admit it, they all stink."
1,Batteries are not available except thru Siemens at $216 each,"Don't bother buying this phone unless you get it cheap! battery replacement is $216 thru Siemens repair depot only. This phone is a real orphan. Talk about a short life cycle!!!I bought mine 2+ years ago and gave up on the phone portion (GSM coverage was lousy). With all the hype about good coverage I switched from TDMA phone back to GSM. Coverage is still bad. What is worse the battery doesn't hold much of a charge now and can't handle PDA and celular functions. As per the above, Siemens wants $216 to replace it plus a nominal 10 day turn around. AT&T; / Cingular wants to know nothing!"
5,Clothing,Exactly what I was looking for. Know how hard it is to find a vibrant purple sweatshirt? Searched for months. Great quality and the absolute perfect color (even if I did have to buy a man's sweatshirt). I am a very happy camper!
5,Very well made,This is a very well constructed moderately heavy sweatshirt. I purchased the burgundy and it washed well without fading. Good thing since I accidentally threw it in with some light colors. Only time will tell if it pills or not.
3,I'd like to hear some enthusiam rather than meek whispering,"The best song on here is ""Thinking in Reverse"". Daniel's vocals are nearly unbearable on most of the tracks though. He holds back way too much, and all the power he'd been capable of seems gone. No, I wasn't hoping for any angry shouting songs he was known for in his Silverchair days, but it would have been nice to hear Daniel be enthusiastic about his supposed new-found happiness. All that meek whispering was just a waste.Nice reference to The Offspring (""Forever and a Day"")"
3,eh... its good,"I loved the last Silverchair record and hated them before that. I ate my words when i heard Diorama. However, i bought this with a now high expectation. This is good but not great. There are some good melodies and some cheesy moments as well. One song has all this whistling in it and it gets really annoying. However, buy it used and you might get your money's worth.Update: Sold it used."
2,Daniel Johns must be absent,"I only listened to clips of a few songs on this album and it made me ill. Maybe Daniel Johns has an evil clone that is taking over his life. The music isn't horrible if you haven't previously listened to ANYTHING EVER done by Silverchair. It kinda sounds like maybe Johns' girlfriend had some input on this album. Silverchair is a great band, and Johns could have done something more ""alternatively"" based. I hope that Silverchair fans don't go insane over this."
4,...and the two powers combine,"A side project, a joke - call it whatever you want. Two musicians, successful in their own right collaberating towards something they havent individually persued. How many people have the guts to do it without seeming plush or arrogant? And further more, how many succeed? Very few.The Dissociatives have made an album thats in many ways disturbing but positive, a melancholy art-pop mix that proves why Paul Mac and Daniel Johns have been regarded so highly as they are.Personal favourites are ""Horror With Eyeballs"", mixing a circus-like verse with a lush melodical chorus, and closer ""Sleep Well Tonight"" which wouldve been a fitting close to Silverchair's ""Diorama"". Think of the difference between ""Neon Ballroom"" to ""Diorama"", thats the kind of comparison to judge between ""I Cant Believe Its Not Rock"" and this album.The Dissociatives are no joke, and will take some getting used to (more so from a lyrical point of view) but its well worth a listen"
2,Its like poison in my ears,I gave this cd a 2star rating just because if you close your eyes and pretend real hard it almost sounds like Silverchair!I am such a big fan of Silverchair and understand that a sideways venture for Daniel Johns is a fun project but I dare anyone to find a song on this album that comes close to any Silverchair classic!!! It honestly sounds like some 2 bit pop rubbish!I hope some popsters get a kick from this but it makes my skin ripple with anger!
1,"Not the ""complete"" history of NM","I purchased this book for myself and 6 of our neighbors as a Christmas gift. I read the book after I gave the book to the 6 neighbors. Had I read the book before giving it as a gift, I would never have given the book as a gift. I was most disappointed in the contents, the style selected for writing the ""fiction"", and the difficulty in following the author's purpose. In short, I gave a gift that has now embarrassed me as a gift giver."
4,It is what it is,"This is a new, unopened prism assembly. Shipping was fast, aswell. However, It is for the prism assembly only! The pole referenced in the title is the candy cane atop the prism. Don't be mislead like I was by the picture showing the long pole attached."
1,Region code restriction,I didn't realize that there's a region code restriction on it. So we're not able to watch up on our TV. Only works in China region system.
5,"Wonderful, Fantastical Read","The Hob's Bargain is one of Patricia Briggs' earlier works. I first discovered Ms. Briggs' writing with her Mercy Thompson series. I have to admit that I left this book sitting on my shelf for quite a while without reading it, but I wish I hadn't.The Hob's Bargain is a fantasy tale first and a love story second. The characters are well drawn out, the story exciting and tense by turns, and the interactions believable. You really come to care about Aren and the Hob as you make your way through their story. This is an excellent stand alone fantasy that is sure to please many different people."
4,If you enjoy fantasy...,"This book han an intresting premise and a fascinating enough world and characters. For me it was an okay book, not exceptional, but decent. I think I might be influenced by the fact that I've read a lot of Briggs resent work before this book, and I find that she has developed forward as a writer, which is how it's supposed to be.I don't normally give 5 stars to book, unless it's book I'd buy again if I lost it, or it's just that good I'd be willing to buy it in hardback, as well. This one isn't one of them."
2,Only work by Patricia Briggs that disappointed me,"Since the other reviewers did great job summarizing and specifying good points and bad points about this book, I will just make a comment. I am a big fan of Patricia Briggs and read all of her books (i.e. ones that are available). I enjoyed all of her books EXCEPT for this one. I don't mind the simplicity of a plot as long as there are a great character development and wonderful diaglogues. I was unable to connect with the main characters. I just did not care what happened to them. To me, it was very slow paced and well...boring. Please don't judge the work by Patricia Briggs by this book. She is a great author and is one of my favorites. In my opionion, this book was just not upto her usual standard."
4,A nice fairy tale kind story...,"In a land that was settled with the help of bloodmagic the hold of bloodmagic is weakening and therefore the wildlings that were bound come back... Aren is a young woman with magic of her own that she has hidden carefully as have all the others with this power, so as not to be killed (the women) or drafted as bloodmages (the men). But now the village needs magic to help it survive after raidings, natural catastrophes and wildlings threaten it. The hob is one of the wildlings that is willing to help the humans. As it is the last of the hobs it needs a wife...Though I liked the idea and the two main characters of the book (and the hob's tail), I felt it lacked depth and vividness. Still it is a nice book."
3,Good book,"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. I thought it was good. It is outside my normal genre. I liked the magic, ghosts, the hob and Aren's struggles. She wanted to do the right thing but so many people of the village were frightened of who/what she was."
3,"Good, but light on substance.","I very much enjoyed this tale, but it ended far too abruptly for my tastes. Excellent world-building, entertaining execution and set-up, which unfortunately leaves you hanging on a few too many points by the end. The Hob is delightful. I wanted to know far more about him!Early work by an excellent author. Ms. Briggs' style is clean and crisp, her build-up great, but the payoff lacks here. Later books by her are better."
4,More please,"I've read Briggs' Steal the Dragon, When Demons Walk, and The Hob's Bargain, and I love all of them. I really look forward to new books from Briggs, and the only complaint that I have is that I think she really needs to continue these individual storylines! They all end in a way that's very conducive to further plot development, and I wonder why she's continued working with her world of magic-hating priests, but she hasn't done any sequels featuring Rialla, Sham, or Aren...If you like adventure mixed with a touch of romance, read these novels."
3,"Good, but leaves you hanging.","The story is good, but how is the relationship going to actually work?"
5,Sets the Standard for Fantasy Reading,"Wow. I never thought I could enjoy anyone's books as much as Patricia Briggs. Though detailed landscapes, storylines, and wonderful characters, she sets the standard with which to read short fantasy. This book is great to read over and over-- just to catch everything you missed the first, second, or third times; it's a fulfilling and amazing read. It begins with a woman imbued with magic in a land deviod of magic. When the magic returns, so do all the creatures that thrive in it.... And it continues from there. Overall, I think it's a great story."
3,"Good, but not amazing","I became a huge Briggs fan after reading her Mercy series, and Omega Wolf book. Her writing is still fantastic in this book, but to me it lacked a lot of action. Major build up, and major detail of the perils that plagued the Main Character and her village. The conclusion was nice too. The only part I didn't like was the build up took too long. The MC doesn't meet the hob until just over halfway through the book, and it took a long time for me to even give a darn about him. All in all, it's a good book, but it's nowhere near as amazing as her Mercy or Omega books."
2,Pleasing Fantasy Elements--but Ho-Hum...,"I thought I would like this. It's a variation on Beauty and Beast tales, which always seem to hit a soft spot with me. However, nothing seemed to gel in this story. The heroine--a perfectly NICE girl, I'm sure, never gained my sympathy nor interest, despite BAD things happening to her (perhaps I hate being so obviously manipulated? Yes, she goes through a lot; I feel bad; she's still not fleshed-out enough to get me to really care about her and what happens to her). The world seemed limited to one valley (definitely limited after magical changes seal the valley off from the rest of the kingdom... but even BEFORE that--I get no concept at all of the world this story is set in). The Hob. Could be very neat. But, again, no quirks of personality that made him interesting or unique.I read the book through, which means that it wasn't awful. It was OK as a fantasy goes. 'Just nothing I'd want to recommend to anyone. Sorry."
1,Jabsco pumps are a nightmare,If you like to have to constantly trouble shoot pumps buy Jabasco. Their pumps are terrible. I have a sailboat and a the problems I have often are their pumps. Look elsewhere
1,Introduction to Electronic Circuit Design,"The seller advertises this book as if he sells the whole book. What I received was in fact only Part B of a two-part book. The hard cover is the whole book, but the soft cover comes in two parts. He did not detail this anywhere, and I had to return it for a refund. He even suggested it was my mistake to buy it and return it, when I really had no way of knowing he was not selling both parts of the book."
5,Healthy cooking,"This book is very well written. The author shows HOW she decreased the fat and calories and comes up with a very tasty alternative. Food values for the revised recipe are listed. A most valuable interesting tool for anyone trying to decrease their cholesterol or lose weight. The food is attractively pictured and her color choices make for a light bright plate of food. Evelyn Tribole is a very imaginative dietitian, many dietitians make diet food look so dull and boring!"
2,"Unwieldy, hard to see","I find this watch unnecessarily heavy. It doesn't stay put. The display is hard to view. I love the style, but if I wanted style alone, I'd buy a bracelet."
4,Great combo workout!,"TWO THE MAX is a super combination step/floor workout. After a great warm up and stretch, you'll progress into well-choreographed step session, followed by a fun, dancy hi-lo session, and then a relaxing cool down and stretch. As always, Kari looks great and her cuing is excellent. The music is motivating and her class is obviously having fun. A good addition to your exercise video library!"
5,It DOES Flip Out of the Way,Please refer to two fotos added by OddJobber in description above.I keep this mounted on-camera most of the time. It has improved by closeup and macro shots 100%!My ONLY complaint is that the diopter adjustment works too easily and has no markings. Just flipping it open to compose the shot then back down to fine-tune focus usually results in resetting the diopters. A couple of dots painted with a toothpick let me quickly reset focus for MY EYES. I guess a drop of super glue would hold it in place for your adjustment if you don't care whether anyone else ever uses it.
4,good for macro and manual focus,For many uses the DR-6 is better...but that one costs almost four times as much as this one.If your main use is macro work then the DG-2 is a much better value.
3,so-so,"they don't mention Nikon D800 here for a reason! this expensive eyepiece does not work on Nikon D800 cameras without the very overpriced trivial $20 intermediate ring. the description to this eyepiece mentions that the additional ring is ""optional"". well, it wasn't included in my option, and I was forced to order it separately.so the whole thing is in $100 range for Nikon D800. probably, you can ask for free ring for their price in the future. I don't expect many buyers are so desperate for this thing for this range of price.focusing with manual lenses is easier, but it's not perfect or very convenient. not very stable and the rubber part is falling off all the time."
2,Expensive & Way too Small,"Nikon usually puts out a quality product, but this eyepiece magnifier is not one of them. The small viewing area defeats any benefit of added magnification. By the way, this originally fit the round eyepieces of the F series cameras.{That should tip you off, it's about 20+ year old technology}. You need an adapter piece to fit the rectangular eyepieces of the DSLR'sIf you do buy it remember that you must focus it by turning the eyepiece lubber part). Never mind, Don't buy this."
1,don't buy this,"When you look through the eye piece you can only see about 20% of the viewing area. This might be good for portraits or macro, but hardly worth it. If it were about 3 times larger it would be great, but its not and it sucks."
5,fantastic METAL album!!!,"Album?!? My apologies,old habits die hard(ahem...)Anyway,heres another great example of ""nobodys reviewed this yet?!!?"".For points of reference,think Man-O-War by way of Bathory(or vice versa?) coupled with Iron Maiden harmonic aspirations.Slower to mid tempo METAL.Great pagan lyrics,great music,great everything.Ive seen this band lumped into the Doom scene,and I wanted to point out the aforementioned references,as Candlemass/St.Vitus/Trouble/etc..ths is not.In any event,this is a KILLER release!An undiscovered classic"
3,The image on the book front was quite wrinkled. I would not have selected this copy had I seen it before.,"I have not yet read the book, just wanted to comment on the condition.The book comes highly recommended by those who have read it."
4,A Princess Remembers,A good read especially if you go to India. It came quick from Amazon and at a very reasonable price.
2,Lifestyles of the Indian rich n famous,"I read this book over a span of 2 days, which leads me to conclude that the prose and sequencing are comparable to any best seller fiction. For a person born in independet India, it was fascinating to read about the jet setting lifestyles of the royals 80 years ago. The author has a selective memory and chooses to speak about the non-controversial aspects of royal living, which was immensely enjoyable. However I wish she had devoted some more pages on the cultural differences between Cooch Behar & Jaipur, for instance what language did she use to communicate with her husband , his other wives....english?? How did she adjust to the lifestyle in post independence India."
5,"A glimpse of a ""bygone India""","I bought the book some 15 years ago while staying in Jaipur at the Rambagh Hotel, one of the princess's former palace.A few weeks ago I have read it again.The author manages to give us a view of the way of life of a very rich people in the early days of the independence of the country. If you have visited India you can feel, even today, the accuracy of the book.It is the sense of a ""bygone age"", of mystery, of oppulence and a portrait of society that you catch when reading the book.I would recomend it before travelling to India, namely to the beautiful city of Jaipur. You will understand much better the spell that India puts on you."
5,Fantastic Metal Polish,"This is a wonderful Metal polish that Meguiars sells through its Marine & RV line. For those of you who have used Meguiars NXT All Metal Polish (Polysh) then you will be glad to know that this metal polish is nearly identical to the NXT version that was discontinued in late 2008. There have been some slight modifications to the product to make it more resistant to saltwater and other elements.I love this stuff...and I don't even have a boat or an RV. I use this on many of the metal products at my house and would not recommended anything else. Plus, this is a big tub of polish (14oz.). Putting that into perspective, most metal polishes are near 5oz. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
3,For Robby Alone,"I have never seen this movie, so it may seem sort of odd to be writing a reveiw about it.It isn't.He is sexy now, so it must be sexy too.This is Elizabeth and Robyn, not some creepy stalker. Well... we're not stalking YOU at least. ;)"
4,Earbuds for Ipod,I really like these Ipod earbuds; they fit comfortably in my ears and they do not hurt. They make the music sound better. I was tired of long cords so I really enjoy that they can be retracted to whatever length is comfortable for you. Sometimes it will retract on its own but I still prefer them over the other ones.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,If you are considering purchasing this product...don't. It is a waste of money. The retractable wires got stuck the second time I used it. I suggest you find something better.
2,Terrible item...,"Ok, so it worked for a few months. A $1.50 set of ear buds will work for a few months too but that isn't what this item is supposed to be. I liked the concept and it saved space but it broke. It broke. It broke. It broke. And just so we are clear, it broke. One ear piece at a time it did! I cut loose the first one that died (about four weeks of ownership) and figured that one out of two wasn't so bad. Then five weeks later the second one broke. In short, a waste of money in my opinion. Try another brand."
1,Retractable Scrap,"The chord, firstly, is not very long at all. If clipped to a belt buckle, it may not reach.I read the previous reviews, so I took great care to avoid stripping the chord. The extra care taken didn't help. Almost exactly two-months after I began using them, there was a snap, crackle and a pop as the audio cut out in one ear... never to return. The other ear-bud soon followed suit.There is nothing positive to say hear other than state that they don't cost much... and that they're not worth even that. They're retractable scrap."
5,Easy to understand,"Having followed the Abraham materials since the late '90's I've always wished this great material could be shared to a broader audience. Margaret McCraw has done so in Tune Into Love. Enjoyable and insightful, and practical as the day is long."
4,Helpful Guide,"Tune Into Love is a useful guide to understanding how to find the love you want and attract it to you. Margaret offers an easy-to-follow four step process that can be implemented immediately. The system offered in this book is not only useful to attracting you ideal mate, but to attracting anything you seek, whether it be health, finances, or other opportunities."
5,clear succinct guide...highly recommend!,"Every page of this book led me on an exciting journey of true discovery of knowing that the power lies within me to create the life I dream of. I found the teachings in this book to be universal, practical, easily understood,and down to earth. My experience is that the principles shared in this book can apply to improving any area of your life you would like to focus on. This is an extraodinary self-help book of self love in the highest sense and attracting your heart's desires in a way that enriches you and others along the way. Please treat yourself to this book, start working with it and start reaping the rewards! It is evident to me that from the stories and examples shared that the author writes from a high place of integrity...one last note...for me it was an easy, enjoyable and fast 'read'."
2,Just Ok,I started out interested in this book but couldn't make it through. It just didn't hold my interest.
5,found the love of my life,"I am a professional therapist who has recently found the love of my life as a direct outcome of reading and studying Dr. McCraw's book; Tune into Love. The technique of vibrational matching has been life altering as I have integrated these principals into my life. I highly recommend this book!!sincerely,Ron Olson"
5,book review,This is a great book. Every woman should read this. It's a book/workbook. There are places in the book to fill things out. It has really given me a sense of the person I am and the person god sees you as. I recommed this book to every woman.
5,Sight reading method,"Bought this, thinking I was advanced enough to skip the first book. After using it a while, I realized there might well be some useful material in first book, both for me and for my students. A good supplementary instruction book."
5,"Oh, so?","Don Rosa is the greatest creator of Uncle Scrooge comics since Carl Barks himself. This book features Rosa's 12 part biography of Scrooge McDuck. Using clues from old Barks comics, he tells the story of how Scrooge became the richest duck in the world. It's a magnicicent comic, which won the 1995 Eisner award for Best Serialized Story. Highly recommended to any fan of Disney comics."
5,Whatever can a Duck do for me?,"I was fasinated by the way Don Rosa treated Carl Barks' story and yet put his own stamp on both the Duck, the clientele and history, even details of geografy like in Dawson. So it may be excused that Mississippi and Ohio are mixed a bit. All in all, if you care for Scrooge McDuck, the book is a must. If you do not care about him, be careful not to read it, you just might become a follower."
3,Be wary when relying on Amazon's description of this product,"Unfortunately I bought this DVD Set 2 after reading only Amazon.com's description of what was on it. But as I wanted the Loch Ness Monster episode particularly I went no further. The DVD's arrived today and Amazon's description is not correct there are different episodes listed.Needless to say I'm very disappointed, I loved The Saint and will enjoy the DVDS but will remember these are the pitfalls when you can't look at the product in your hand."
1,Not compatible,"Like the other reviews state, I found that the car charger is NOT compatible with the Cingular 8525. Buyer beware."
1,Does not work with Cingular 8525!,"Beware, despite the description, these items does not work with the HTC Cingular 8525. I found out the hard way."
2,Will not charge a discharged 8125,"These chargers will not charge a discharged 8125, they will ""top off"" a partially discharged battery if more than half charged. Cheap price, two bit performance."
3,The price is right,The AC unit appears to be non regulated power so I will not use it. But I really bought this for the car charger. Works great and you will have a hard time beating the price. I use this on the 8125
1,buyer beware.,"I ordered Cell phone batteries, my cell fone is 4+ years old and thebattery finally was worn out. The new batteries fail to hold a charge any longer than my old cell phone battery, I expected more from a new battery. They were cheap, yes, but I'm not totally sure they were worth it at any price, good thing I bought two of them. Now I have three crappy batteries. Funny part, the phone in the add for my phone, shows my exact battery, so you'd think you would be getting what's in the picture, NOT."
3,it did the job,"The home charger is great, it's still working to this day w no problems. but the car charger was shaky from day one and it finally broke a couple of month ago. over all for what I have paid, the units did very well for what I have paid for them."
1,unsure and dissappointed,"I bet it is a good product but somehow i didn't even got this delivered yet, its been more than a month by now..."
1,BUYER BEWARE DOES NOW WORK!!! with 8525,CAUTION! CAUTION! CAUTION! I am an engineer neither of these chargers will charge my 8525. The picture of the car charger is not accurate! The cord is coiled not strait.WILL NOT DO BUISNESS AGAIN. DO NOT FALL FOR THE CHEEP PRICE.
1,Not for 8525,"Yes it's only a penny, but they sent me chargers for an Ipod and not an 8525. If this is what you want, great. It was not the item that is shown. Do not order this item or from Bargain Cell."
5,Great little pump,"I don't know what the pressure you needed to get your tires to, but I blew a tire just yesterday on a century ride and pumped it right back up with no problems.Make SURE you fold down the handle or you will be doing a lot of pumping, but almost no filling once you get past 60 psi. I was stuck at 60 for a while until I realized that the pump didn't work too well with half pumps. Once I pulled down the handle I got it up to 90 psi with no problems!"
4,Mounting Challenges,"So far, I love this little pump. It's lightweight and it pumps on both strokes. However, I was challenged in mounting it on my bike in such a way that my pedalling wouldn't be compromised.I ended up ""forcing"" it to attach to my Camelback, using the velcro.Recommendation: Supply a simple set of velcro straps that attach the mounting bracket to any post on the bike.The little pin that holds the top handle on can come out (if your 250 lb friend pumps too hard on the handle...).Great tool, good buy for sure."
2,Failed me when I needed it,"This pump worked okay at first. I rarely needed it as I only used it for emergencies. After being mounted to my bike for about 2 years, duty called and it totally failed. The seals inside must have been worn out. Despite rarely using it the thing failed. Its great to get you up to 60 psi max to get home when its working, but I wouldn't count on it to work when you need it."
2,Next to useless,"2 stars because I guess this could get you through an emergency. I carry this pump everywhere and I leave it on my bike hoping somebody will steal it. I also use Bontrager Hardcase tires and have never had a flat. I have not had a real need for it so maybe I just don't have enough practice with it. But I think I just broke a blood vessel in my middle finger while attempting to hold the pump square on the presta value for 500 strokes to get to about 70% of the pressure I needed. At least bike shops are like coffee shops here in Portland and I can find someplace with a real pump on the way home.I would like to only post positive reviews, but when something is so poorly implemented, I can only hope to discourage sales of the product and save somebody else some money and headache. I know... I should step away and cool off for a couple of hours before posting..."
3,"Decent book, a wee bit repetitive","I think Bobby Sands was a very interesting person and decent writer, especially considering that he had no formal education to speak of. He shows a veriety of writing styles, prose and poetry. However, I think he becomes incredibly repditive! I understand that this is all he has to write about, but I think he obsesses over certain issues and becomes rather self-indulges on hiss own suffering. He seems to leave out many things, such as what the ""screws"" would taunt them with, perhaps this was because they would say how the IRA killed innocent people! He also leaves out the fact that he abondoned his own child and wife, though she divirced him because of his decision to hold the IRA above his own family. I admire his endurance and unwavering belief in hos cause, something which too many people lack today. Conviction!"
4,bought this at Target for $50,"It's not the best quality,but for $50 it's worth it. I would not pay almost $150 for this."
3,Poor cover; bowl rusted within a month,"The fire pit is sturdy, easy to assemble and looked very nice. After a few weeks, the screen rusted, then the cover broke and the bowl itself started rusting after about 2 months. I will continue to use this fire pit as it's still functional, but it has completely lost it's good looks. For having spent a Benjamin and a half I would have expected better quality. Overall disappointing.UPDATE 1/5/2013: I have changed this review from 2 to 3 stars based on the seller sending me a brand new unit on warranty. I will see how long the screen will last this time, maybe I just had a bad one last time. I was impressed with the fact that they were willing to send me a brand new one, and I did not have to send the old one back. That is great customer service."
2,More inferior Chinese workmanship,"We ordered the CobraCo FB6132 Fire Pit, and it arrived quickly on Prime. Very disappointed that the bowl itself doesn't even come close to the one pictured on Amazon or on the photo on the box. I knew it wasn't ""real"" copper, but the finish should have at least TRIED to look like copper. It is just a lousy black paint job over something that looks like copper colored paint. What kind of toxic haze will the paint cause when exposed to the fire? Haven't had it long enough for rust to set in, but we are in FL where it is very humid sometimes so I do expect it to rust based on other reviews here. We too experienced issues with matching up the support pieces - the holes aren't lined up properly. I am really tired of stuff from China - no quality control at all. I would like to have them send a bowl that actually looks like the photo, but that might be more trouble than it's worth if the finish burns off anyway. I feel cheated."
2,Terrible cover = Signs of Rust in 10 days,"This was a gift to us, but as soon as we put it out with the cover on, we found the bowl completely filled with water after rain storms. I held the cover up to the light and could see light shining through EVERY stitch, plus random holes from who knows what. Now that ""copper finish"" has split from the water, and the cover is already rusted within about 2 weeks--having never even used it. Sad. It also came with a 2inch crack in one side of the ledge, but we didn't want to bother the gift giver and return it, so we're still using it. We bought a better cover and are just happy to have a firepit since we don't have a fireplace!"
1,Mary B.,This product was a huge disappointment since it began to rust immediately. I should have returned the product but had already destroyed the packaging. The reviews I read prior to my purchase were positive but that was not what I experienced. Hopefully my experience was an exception and others are happy with their fire pit.
3,Purchase a NEW COVER before you buy,"The cover that came with this fire pit ripped as I put it on the FIRST time. It has seams in it and ripped out on all the seams. Unfortunately, I did not purchase a new cover right off, so the screen has rusted ALOT."
1,Miss,The product is supposed to come with a cover however there was no cover therefore my rating is poor!! This was a gift.
2,WARNING: Shipping box displays picture,"I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. Unfortunately, it was delivered with a picture of the product on the side. Since my husband got to the UPS delivery before I did, he already knows what his gift is. Don't order this as a surprise unless your gift recipient doesn't live with you!"
1,ooooh. a cookie cutter! what better way to pasteurize an already watered-down genre??,"if you can't make music, there is no manual that will help achieve what you do not possess. there might be basic terminology defined in this book, but GOOD MUSIC CANNOT BE TAUGHT. sorry."
5,Would have put 6 stars if they were available!,"This book is a must have for all budding and professional musicians alike. It covers everything you need to know. This is absolutely the best book on my shelf for music production by far. If you're thinking about should I or shouldn't I part with the money for this book, don't worry, just do it as the infomation is well worth the investment. This book covers many genres of music from House to Techno to Trance and more. Furthermore, from this book I learnt how to build a basic website which I consider a bonus for those wishing to promote there music on the web. Nice one Rick, I look forward to purchasing Volume 2, this book is the best!"
5,SUPERB,"Superb reading! great info and a joy to read. Really indept info with lot's of suggestionson how to mix your track. The writer really knows what he is talking about and doesn't mind to share.Not everybody wants to share his knowledge now a days, so this is very nice.The writer knows just about every detail to know on electronics, sounds and musicgenres.If you can get it and if your interested in the subject and have your own homestudio make sure to get it. Even if you have lots of experience this book will help you even further. I just can't stop reading it. i guess i begin upfront again when i first finished the book. Includes a cd-rom with examples. The website and trainingcourse are, however, no longer available."
5,well worth the money,Don't pay attention to negative comments.Most of these people just showing off because they may know a bit about music.This book is worth more than twice it's price.If you know what you're doing in music then you don't need it.... but I doubt it.Everyone can learn from this book. Music explained in simple easy to understand way.This is how a book should be written dealing with highly technical content.
2,Beginner level and historical information,This book seems decent for beginners and informative for those not involved in the underground music scene. But it doesn't offer a whole lot in the way of composition and production techniques except for the most basic information.
2,"Great Lamp, Terrible Battery Life",I bought this product for my Camcorder for special events. After using it for 20 min. it died. The lamp it's ok for the money. I would recommend going the extra mile and get a bigger battery because you are going to be really disappointed with this product.
5,air Control Valve,Works as advertised but I would suggest to go electrics. Pneumatics are to troublesome and electrics are the wave of the future.
2,Doesn't work..,"As a diabetic, I ordered this hoping it would help reduce the pain involved with multiple insulin injections every day. It was extremely awkward to use. Using one hand to hold it in place and the other to perform the injection, I was unable to ""pinch"" the skin as I usually do during injections, and the Shotblocker did not make it painless, despite following the instructions to the letter. It was also completely impossible to use on my own arms, since I could not hold it in place and inject myself. I had high hopes for this, but sadly, it has done nothing but collect dust in a drawer after a few days of trying."
5,"Brilliant, every kid needs one.","Little one gets B12 shots and monthly IVs. No more pain. We used to use EMLA cream but that caused problems for the IV by shrinking the veins, and he still felt the pain. Not even one oww with this awesome product. So impressed."
5,winner,"this works great for allergy shots which my grandson gets twice a week, we put ice pack on his arms and then use the shot blocker and he doesn't even flinch. It's not as effective for some shots, but it has saved my sanity."
4,cute sloth,i was suprised when recieving the sloth that it actually looked as good as it did over the internet. very satisfied and so was the reciever of the present. the shipping was very quick too being on the other side of the world
4,Great Sloth,I bought this sloth for my niece's birthday gift. We decided to adopt an animal through the WWF and she chose the Three Toed Sloth. This plush version is very similar to the photo and adoption certificate she is receiving. Very cute!
5,PhotoImpact XL rocks!,"I agree with the above reviewer. This is an excellent graphics tool! My ONLY advice to potential customers would be to purchase the boxed version, not the download (even though its delivery is immediate.)I am buying a new computer and will now have to re-purchase the PIXL program and I could have avoided the re-purchase had I been patient enough to wait on the boxed version's delivery by post. Ulead built a real keeper in this product! I use it for nearly all of my commercial graphics clients and there are on-line classes available, as well, which I HIGHLY recommend. Just a hint in the right direction (not an advertisement, but this is my instructor), look up Stephanie's Tutorials in your search engine for the best instruction I've come across. She also holds 6 week on-line classes.Check some of PhotoImpact's results on my own website, if you want to see some of the things you can do with this package:www.ofaolaingraphicdesigns.comNeedless to say, I LOVE this package!"
5,Definite keeper!,"This was my first Brownyn Jameson's book and would not be my last. I fell in love with Zara and Alex, saw their struggle to fight their growing attraction to one another. I enjoyed their chemistry, loved the tension and dilemma between Zara and Alex. I would recommend this book."
4,No Photographs,"I'm giving this a 4-star because the recipes looked good and easy. However, I returned this book because it didn't contain any photographs. I know it sounds silly, but I find that having a photo of each meal helps to inspire me when meal-planning."
5,I love this book,"The title of this book is perfect. Moldova certainly is a Lost Provence. Unfortunately this book is at least 10 years out of date. But for those interested in Moldova, it is one of the only books out there. It shows the heart, and the difficulties of life in this poor country. I read this book twice, and I remember many parts of it. For those just learning about Moldova this book along with Tony Hawks book, provides a nice contrast. Just like David Remnick's writings about Russia... I wished that this author would have stayed and kept on writing about Moldova."
2,Ok game but not worth it.,"I thought this game would be fun, but I was bored with it in a few hours. PLus it didn't work right with my computer. I guess it's a ok game, but it wasn't worth the cost."
3,I ordered a little bottle because I had never smelled this before,"I'm glad you can order small bottles in case you decide not to use it. I wasn't so impressed with this scent, it smells to me like an older person might wear it. I'm 44 but when I wear this it makes me feel like it is the wrong scent on me and an older person is lurking around the corner from me. I'm still trying to find the right Curve for me, I smelled it on this one woman and I truly love it and she told me it was Curve...but I didn't realize that there were so many Curve types out there...so I will keep on looking for small bottles until I find the right one for me."
2,Weird cut T shirt & oddly sized too!,"I ordered the white T in extra large. I'm a woman's 14 and it was too small. Not only that, it was a weird cut. The body of it was just a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but the arm size was more like I'd expect on a medium size (like they put medium size arms onto their extra large size T). If you are busty with skinny arms, this seriously might be a good cut of a T shirt for you- no joke! Other: material and logo were very nice. Order at least one size larger if you decide to buy."
2,Not a good fit for the Moccamaster,"apparently people are frequently buying them together, but this filter does not fit well in the Moccamaster and is too slow to keep up with the pump, resulting in overflowing. Better (wonderful actually) results from paper filters in the Moccamaster."
2,Didn't hold up,"Less than six months after buying this one, it's got tears in the filter. It doesn't go in the dishwasher and there's no heavy usage or harsh washing (mostly just rinsing). I thought by spending a little more, I'd get better quality but it's just not holding up to 3x per week use. I'm going back to the Cuisinart one I had before."
1,"Misleading Title-No Hunting, Just Talking","Title of this video indicates that there will be actual grouse hunting scenes and shots to see. Instead what you get is long long boring lectures and irrelevant topics. Tom Hugler looks like a marketing person of a shoe manufacturing compnay. He keeps on telling you about shoes, socks, hunting vests, food & habitat of grouse, grouse conservation organizations, feather colors, dogs etc, sitting on a comfortable chair in a room. Just a few blurred scenes of dogs flushing grouse in very thick cover. Only one or two actual shots fired on grouse during total 45 minutes of film. A complete waste money and time. What you expect in a hunting video is the filming of actual hunting scenes. No one is interested in learning basics of upland game. Every average hunter knows which shoes to wear, what kind cloths and guns are required. A lot of time wasted on interviews and showing techniques of research workers of a grouse conservation society."
1,Unsatisfied performance,"I have ordered two of these CDS in order to get one that performed satisfactory. The first one had a lot of static and geberish when I tried to play it. I first thought that there was something wrong with my stereo system, but I tried several other CDS and they played just fine.The second CD plays just fine.The only complaint other than that is that we can't return a defected CD once it is opened leaving you with a defective product that doesn't operate properly."
3,Jerry Lee schmaltz,Consumate self promoter. But only 2-3 rockers. The rest slow good-ol-boy country. Never knew the majority of Jerry lee's output was country. Liner notes informative.
5,THE BEST of THE BEST,The unsung KING OF ROCK N ROLL!!!!! The best of the best and still going after the rest are gone.
5,"Great, Fun Resource",I bought this book so my children could learn about other religions. I recently took a college Religions of the World class and I used this book throughout my class. It simplified complex religions and made them easier for me to understand. The internet links are great. There were many wonderful sites that make it fun to learn. I will definately buy more books from this series for my children.
4,Easy Enjoyable Read,"I bought this to explain world religions to my 2 year old son, when he starts asking those questions... Most adults are impressed that I have it my collection of books for him and when any adult opens it, they become engrossed in the words and illustrations. More than one person has told me they've learned a few things from this book."
5,I love it!,"I don't review stuff just to kill time. If I really like something, I want other people to know it is a great value.Well, for years I have walked around with a chronically tight lower back. I have tried the usual: Ben-Gay, lying on rolled up towels, hot baths, and having my wife walk on my back. I basically had gotten used to the discomfort and hadn't realized it.Wow!! Who knew HOW WELL THIS WORKED??!!! Comparing this to my other methods is like comparing water pistols to bazookas. How I wish I had bought this years ago!!!! I am sitting here typing and the discomfort of my lower back is noticably less, and getting better every day. I love it, I just love it. And I have owned it for less than a week."
1,not working for me,"The lumbar extender did not help my problem. In fact, I found it to be very uncomfortable and it seemed to cause more lower back problems for me than it helped. The cost is also more than the product is worth. Sorry. This is a thumbs down :("
4,Release the Stress,"I consulted with my chiropractor before I bought the lumbar extender back stretcher. He said that it would be good for my back. It must do something because it hurts when I fully stretch with my legs straight and arms above my head. The stretch is relieved a little when I bend my knees. I think it is a good product, and I would recommend it for people with back problems. I have scolosis and some vertbrae out of alignment. I use it on the days I can't make it to the chiropractor office."
4,Works for me,"I bought this as an alternative to continuing to pay the chiropractor. It definitely helps stretch my back, which is really what I needed. Perhaps not taking care of the other ""adjustments,"" but I don't think those were really doing much for me. I'm trying to focus on self-treatment and stretches which will be better for me for the long term."
3,Temporary Relief,"I suppose there is no magic bullet for chronic back pain. This product is not bad, not great. It helps somewhat, so that is about all one can hope for."
1,Order this elsewhere,"Lumbar Extender Back StretcherMine supposedly shipped April 17th with an estimated arrival date of April 25. As I write this, it's May 1 and no Lumbar Extender in sight. Supposedly it's sitting in Denver. Doesn't do my Virginia back much good there."
5,Awesome product,If you sit at a desk for all day at work you spine takes a toll on you upper and lower back. I use it everyday when I get home from work. It is very realaxing feeling have all the muscles in your back stretch. It think it may also be helping with my bad posture from sitting at a desk all day. Fantastic Product!
4,5 minutes and I am good to go.,"I am relatively young, 26, but have had lower back problems most of my life. I bought this product for my husband, who also has back problems. We both benefit from this product greatly. I use it at least a few times a week to keep my spine in line. This product has helped both me and my husband, so that we don't have to deal with back problems any more. If we feel like we are in need of a little stretch we just pull it out and use it for about 5 minutes and we are good to go. The only thing that is a little bothersome, is that it can get uncomfortable after laying on it for a while. When you are going to get up you should do so slowly."
3,Good for only stretching,"I'm still not sure if this product does any good. I've had it for three months now and have used it almost daily. My back cannot handle the pain beyond level one, although I attempt to try level two every now and then unsuccessfully (I wish the gap between level one and two were smaller). Sometimes my back gets worse from use, and other times I do feel like it gives me a good stretch. At any rate, its construction is durable, and is quite easy to assemble. Overall, my back hasn't gotten better from use; although I notice my posture has improved. Therefore, I don't highly endorse this product, unless someone wishes to use it for yoga or other stretching purposes."
4,Great product,Very good product has replaced my Chiropractor for minor adjustments. Works instantly. Easy to use.
1,Horrible!,"I had good experience with a similar though different product (I intentionally don't write its name) and I wanted to try this one - it is absolutely horrible - I returned mine.Problems: It is not rigid enough, it has the wrong shape and the gap it too wide to support the spine - it doesn't even have rubber buttons to stop it from slipping - if you just need a stretch - this may be a good choice, but if you have any problem with the spine or need the spine aligned don't even get close to this product."
1,Not Comfortable At Any Level,"My husband is 6'3"" and I am 5'1""; if that isn't a broad cross-section of potential users for this product, I don't know what is. At no curvature level of this stretcher was either one of us comfortable. My husband broke his back in college and I had a rear-end auto accident that totalled an SUV...we were certainly good candidates for a back relief product. Too bad this product did not offer any.The plastic is hard and uncomfortable, and the curve levels so over-exaggerated even at the low position that with more than a dozen attempts over the course of a week neither one of us could achieve anything more than additional pain with the use of the stretcher.The same amount of money is far better invested in two decent chriopractic adjustments, or one half-hour massage."
2,Disappointing,It was not what I expected and is quite pricey for a big piece of plastic. It could use a lower setting as even on the lowest setting right now it is a big stretch for the lumbar region and becomes uncomfortable very quickly.
4,Works great..for Piriformis Syndrome,"I have Piriformis Syndrome for years until I discovered this $80 Lumbar Extender. I could have spent $30 for the exact same item in black (also sold in Amazon). I could have use a couple of pillows I already own. But only this $80 Lumbar Extender Back Stretcher could have cure my Piriformis Syndrome. All I have to do was buy one every week, give it to a friend or relative. A few months later, no more Piriformis Syndrome. Like magic!P.S.Piriformis Syndrome also known as Fat Wallet Syndrome."
2,Lumbar Extender Back Stretcher,"It was painful for my husband to use - unless you lie on it just right, it hurts. We haven't used it long enough to know if it really works."
3,not really country,Holly sassafras and sucatash! If it isn`t milk toast country! His renditions of ANYTIME and TENNESSEE WALTZ are just too too much. For a good John Gary album may I suggest SPANISH MOONLIGHT? Malaguena Salerosa is great as is the entire album.
5,Good for kids and adults,"I bought this for my one-year-old son. He likes it, but I was surprised that I like it too."
5,A great CD for just about anyone,"At first I thought the music was really weird when my wife first put it into the CD player; however, it has really grown on me over the week that I have been listening to the music. My 8 month old really loves it too. We all love the song ""Cows,"" ""Snuggle Puppy,"" and ""Snoozers."" I recommend that this is CD is a must buy for all ages."
1,CD scratched,"The CD is very scratched and won't play some songs. I had to upload it to my computer and burn a copy. It was listed in good condition, but how can that be?"
5,Just as Fun for Adults,"This book/CD is just as entertaining for adults as it is for children. My toddler loves the themes to the songs even though the music would be considered show tunes. He askes for this book or Rhinoceros Tap every day. As an adult, I appreciate the humor in the lyrics."
5,"Up, Over and Into the CD Player","This CD is alot of fun.Sandra Boynton takes words from some of her short-story books (snoozers, for example), and creates some brand new lyrics for a really enchanting CD of music for kids that's OK for adults.If you child is anything like my son, it might even spark a career in dance or music (assuming you don't mind dancing to the ""Philadelphia Chicken"" over and over and over again ;))At some point I read a review of this that wanted to know how they got all these famous people and incredible singers to sing on the CD - I did actually ask one of the more famous singers and she said ""Well, Sandy asked me"" - wish I'd thought of that!Then again, when I get as many great books published as Sandra Boynton it might actually work for me!"
4,Excellent Drive!,"I selected this drive for the PC I was building and it works great. I've previously owned Western Digital, Quantum, and Maxtor drives.The drive I received was a Quantum drive in the Maxtor box. This was fine with me for two reasons, 1.) I knew that Maxtor had purchased Quantum's HD unit, and 2.) My 6.4 GB Quantum Fireball is 5 years old and still works fine. Maxtor provides the warranty and support, but I thought the rebadging was something that potential buyers should be aware of."
5,Maxotr 60 gigabyte hard disk reveiw,"This product, Maxtor 60 GB hard drive, is offered for a decent price, and is an overall good product. The actual product is well made, reliable, and efficiant. It can store a wopping 60 GB, so it is a wonderful upgrade to ANY computer! I highly reccomend this product to others."
5,Great Album,"This is an underrated album that should have been in the top ten on the charts . A musical work of art I have been waiting for on CD . All at a reasonable price , MP3 makes it instant delivery ."
3,ships with sails makes it worth getting alone,"I was fortunate to find this on vinyl at a used bookstore. I must be honest, I didnt no what to expect from a doors album post jim morrison. I will have to admit my expectations were pretty low. The album is hit and miss, and ray m. doesnt come close to morrison as far as vocals are concerned, that being said the album has its share of strong moments. The song ships with sails in my opinion is one of the best doors songs ever recorded rivaling just about anything morrison did with the band. it has a steady groove and delivers a signature doors sound, even if this were an insurmental I would have known it was a doors song. On the other hand you have songs like variety is the spice of life wich are pretty awful. All in all the band was bold enough to continue a few years without jim and Im glad they did."
5,good stuff,This is the same stuff that you had as a kid back in the 50's. It has so much licorice it is slightly bitter. I used to purchase this $100 at a time when I would make a trip to Canada 10 years ago. You can now get the same stuff from the comfort of your home. Really good stuff if you are a black licorice freak.
1,Unhappy,You should disclose when items are not being sold from the US or shipped. I purchased this as standard delivery with the assumption it was coming from the US not Canada because this was being shipped from Canada it did not fall into the standard shipping guidelines and was not received in time for Christmas NOW i have to take the time to contact the vendor to see if they will accept a return and pay for the shipping - this would cause me NOT to do future purchase on amazon.com
1,OLD PERFUME,I PURCHASED SUNG AND IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY COMPAIRABLE SENT TO THE BOTTLE I ALREADY HAVE. I REALLY HATE IT AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS COMPANY.
2,For men who likes to smell like a woman,"I bought this cologne because of the reviews that I read on here. When I recieved it and smelled it, I had to get on here and make sure I didn't make a mistake. I thought for sure it was a womans purfume. Weird that the ratings are so good on here."
4,Agradable aroma.,Aroma agradable y perdurable. Buena relación calidad y precio.es un perfume con algún tiempo en el mercado que se ha mantenido.
4,Well balanced fragrance,"Light and ""citrussy"", not to heavy, but a little goes a long way. This is something I use as an everyday scent."
1,Allergic,"My wife loves Alfred Sung perfumes. I decided to try the men's cologne. When I put it on, I noticed right away that this cologne was not for me. I had an allergic reaction to it. However, I gave it to my son, and he has been using it, and has no problem. It's probably just me."
5,What a value!,Using it for over a decade. Clean and cool smelling just strong enough for all day every day use. It's got all the good smells to make you smell great all day-highly recommeded!
5,Love!,"I have always loved this scent. Too bad its not more popular. However, since its not more popular the price is great! Its a nice light spice and citrus"
4,A Great Read,"I am normally not much for time-travel books, but as I know this author I decided to give it a try. The story of Jared and Trish (Mac)is just great. I did not read the other books in the series and I don't feel cheated. Although a few characters from previous stories in the series do appear I feel this story stands on its own. A modern day girl sent back to the late 1800 in a classic fish out of water story. Jared is a Pinkerton detective searching for a serial killer. There is a twist, the killer travels back and forth between Mac's time and Jared's killing young, pure girls in both times. This stories offers lively and humourous dialogue between all the characters and Mac, a great romance, and suspense which makes this a real page turner."
5,door closer,this works great i must say its not even noticable on my door and its even quiet and it adjust so u dont let ur door slame great product
2,Worked well . . . but then failed.,This closer worked normally for 7 months and then failed to close the door properly and began to leak oil. I was using it on a light weight storm door that was frequently used. The previous closer unit had lasted over 10 years but was no longer available. I am replacing the failed unit with a Touch'n Hold Smooth Single Kit - BlackTouch'n Hold Smooth Single Kit - Blackalso available on Amazon that hopefully is more reliable and has the added feature of an easy hold and release.

5,Great router!,"I purchased this abought 6 months ago. I use it mostly in a bench dog router table. I purchased the bench dog router lift kit and plate came with screws to mount router to router lift kit made by bench dog (cast iron model). Lined up perfectly. Router has plenty of power even with 2 1/2"" raised panel bit. Router has special feature were it automatically boost's the power when cutting material to keep rpm of motor at same rpm cutting or not cutting. Collets automatically release bit and I have never had a bit get hung in collet. Great router and I would recomend to any one looking for a well built and powerfull router to use nay size bit they please. A++++++++++++"
4,router,"Works well. Barrel of router smaller than I expected, and smaller than the others I have of the same power therefore not useful in the router table."
4,Awesome workout,"I bought this two weeks ago and have already lost 4 lbs. I really love it. The beginners session is slow and kills my muscles, while the intermediate session focuses more on dance moves rather than cardio. But I'm sweating through both sessions, so I guess it's working. This dvd, however, is not for absolute beginners - you should have some knowledge/understanding of weight shifting during dance."
2,Not a workout DVD!,"I loved ""Fitness with the Pros"" and have been looking for this DVD since. I finally got it, and to my complete disappointment it turns out to be a dance instruction DVD for which you actually need a partner. I totally thought this was an advanced version of the Fitness DVD with other dances and routines. I was crushed :("
4,Not for beginners,I would not recommend this for beginners as it may intimidate you. But it is a good video for advanced students.
2,Not for Fitness,This was not good for a cardio workout. This is for instruction to dancing. You need a partner. I do love fitness with the pros. This is a lot better for a cardio workout.
2,Not for beginners,"The package contains two discs, each containing instructions for two of the 4 dances covered. There is very little initial tutorial for people, such as myself, who have never had any formal dance instruction. The transition from the earliest basic instruction is much to rapid for a beginner to grasp. The lessons would have been better if there was, for example, a ""birds eye view"" of how their feet were moving or they did the dance moves in even smaller pieces then joined them together. I'd imagine there are more helpful instructional videos available. If not, someone should rethink the way these videos are presented to the customers. Don't let the names on the box think you're getting anything great."
2,Not a teaching video,"Great production, but this video fails as a teaching video, unless you learn strictly by watching and picking up moves as they happen real time. It goes from watch to warp speed in what seems like just seconds without much detail or practice time. Going through the video is frustrating as a student and not recommended. If you want to get the video to look at several good looking people dancing for entertainment purposes, that's up to you. I'd much rather just watch Dancing With The Stars."
5,...All The Sparks Fly Up!,Wonderful book Could not put it down. I will be looking for another book by Thomason He can really write
2,"Incomplete, but worth a read","The book is written essentially as a series of stories about Einstein. The book was able to hold my interest to finish it, but barely so - many of Einstein's achievements seem a bit muted, and there aren't enough details about his personal life. Details of Einstein's personal life were casually tossed away in a brief paragraph that should have merited an entire chapter.Having said that, the book might be worth a read... based on why your reading it. It just give details about Einstein's most famous achievements.Of course what's truly remarkable about Einstein is that he lived a life so full of achievements that perhaps no biography has the space to cover the broad sweep of his life. He accomplished as much as 10 Nobel Laureates combined, so maybe you just can't fit a super achieving scientist like this in a book."
3,good but too long,This is really a good book. Mostly becuase Einstein was a great man and did amazing work. But it is not a great book becuase it gets too bogged down in his personal life. When the author is describing his miracle year of 1905 and then ten years later his theory of general relativitiy there is a sense of excitement and wonder. Unfortanately after that the book wanders around aimlessly. I really did not want to hear every tedious detail of his divorce or his (at times) acrimonious relationship with his first wife. It all feels like filler and a distraction from the amazing work that this man did. I'm sad to say but Einstein's personal life is not anywhere near as exciting as his great discoveries and to devote almost the entire book to his personal life seems like a waste of time.
3,Well Researched,"I enjoyed this biography of Einstein, but just wished it was a little shorter. Clearly Isaacson spent a lot of time researching the book, I just wish he had edited down to about 300 pages from the 540 pages the books contains. He quotes many letters and correspondences, with footnotes, to prove his points. However, Einstein was Time's man of the year and after reading this I better understand why. He is much more than just E=mc^2."
3,The Science Stuff,"I flew throught the first six chapters of this book. The science stuff slows me down. Some of it I really don't get, but Einstein was such an interesting guy. I'm really enjoying this book dispite the scinece stuff."
1,Great subject. Dumb author.,This biography's attempt to turn the theories of the greatest mind of the twentieth century into a function of personality is pathetically pedestrian and inane. A pity.
1,Disappointed,I ordered this book (which was advertised as being signed by the author) as a gift for a friends birthday which was one month following the date of my order. The book took over 2 weeks to arrive and it was NOT SIGNED. Am frustrated and left without enough time to get the gift I intended to give.
4,Einstein was a great read,"Einstein was a great read - I gained a new appreciation for Einstein as a person and his scientific world. In the beginning of the book, I didn't know quite what to think of Einstein. I couldn't tell if he possessed great confidence or if he crossed over to being arrogant, and I wasn't impressed with how he handled his personal relationships. However, as the book went on, I gained an appreciation for his thirst for knowledge, his independent thinking, confidence, determination, and even kindness"
4,You Think You Know Einstein,"You think you know Einstein. I thought I did, and then I read Isaacson's well-researched, moving, personal depiction of the man. Sure, there's the stuff everyone knows - relativity, his humble beginnings as a patent clerk, his involvement in (or, as it turns out, his absence from) the Manhattan Project. What few people may know is that Einstein was in some ways brilliant and prone to wildly amazing insights about nature and physics - but he could also be naive, stubborn, standoffish, unable to maintain relationships with those closest to him... in short, he was incredibly human. An added strength of this book, beyond the humanistic approach, was the very clear, concise way in which Isaacson described physics concepts that most people find incredibly hard to understand. Well worth your time, whether you're a physics nut or a biography buff."
3,did the author know of Einstein's Asperger Syndrome?,"Forgive me. I have only read the review while I search for a good biography. I see a grave error. The author is wonderfully enamored with Einstein, yet applaudes a humanistic view? eh? Einstein is a genius. And like many geniuses the brilliance on intellect comes with downsides on empathy/humanism. Einstein is believed by many scholars to have had Asperger Syndrome which is a biological/neurological handicap in understanding empathy and readying people situations. that is, they are emotionally like 3-10 y/o for their entire life. . .which explains some of the absurd non-scientific pontifications.My point is simply that a good biography should understand his pros and cons, including Asperger Syndrome, so as to more accurately portray the brilliant, yet difficult individual."
1,Finally gave up on this book,"I do not read fiction. History is my subject and I have read about Lincoln, Truman, LBJ, JFK, Jefferson, space exploration, the Civil War, incredible tales of survival and heroics, climbing Mt. Everest, etc. I can only recall one other book that I finally gave up on and now cannot remember which one it was. I had just read Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs and enjoyed it and Ben Franklin is waiting in the wings. I now have quit this book about half way through.My take is this: Either Issacson does not do a good job of explaining the theory of relativity (he does have an interest in it and it seems a pretty good knowledge of the theory) or I am just too thick. Now, I am certainly not the sharpest knife in the drawer but I did just retire from flying large jets to international destinations for the last 34 years. Also, as high powered, driven, intelligent people go, I just did not find Albert Einstein all that interesting."
3,Missing pages,"The book was quite good, an appropriate mix of physics and history. My copy had about 35 pages nesr the end that were simply missing, replaced by 35 pages of earlier material I had already read. Apparently a mistake when the book was bound"
3,Fails to paint an accurate picture of Einstein's religious views,"Einstein's religious views have been the source of much debate over the years, beginning long before the great man's death. Yet for a book which so thoroughly explores many aspects of this icon's life, it's a startling - and frankly rather sad - that Mr. Isaacson has elected to exclude a serious exploration of these views.In so doing Mr. Isaacson has foregone an opportunity to clarify Einstein's position, and famous quotes such as ""Der Herrgott würfelt nicht"" (""God does not play dice"") will continue to be misinterpreted/exploited.The interested reader can nevertheless make up for this omission by referring to Christopher Hitchens' ""The Portable Atheist"", which contains an entire chapter of Einstein's writings on the matter of his (non-)belief."
3,Even Einstein can't live up to being Einstein...,"I was impressed with the amount of research that Walter Isaacson put into this book. He obviously worked not only to accurately capture who Einstein was, but also did a credible job of explaining Einstein's discoveries for a non-scientific audience.Where the book left me wanting was not the rendition, but the subject matter itself. There should be some expectation here; Einstein is larger than life and there is bound to be some disappointment once the pedestal is removed. To someone who studied Physics in college as I did (and yet has few advantages in understanding Einstein's work over everyone else), Einstein holds rock-star status. However, I found that were I offered dinner with past figures of my own choosing, Einstein likely would not make my short list."
3,Held my interest for a while.,"I read about 1/2 of the book, getting to the time of his life where he generated his historic theories about relativity. It was generally interesting, but I moved on to other books instead of finishing."
4,The Man,"Overall I liked the book. Learning about the mythical man as a person was interesting to say the least. As it turns out the image I had of him had little to do with reality. He was a human being with all of the dysfunctions that go along with being just that. On the other hand he was a genius of a human being and this got him a lot of passes for what was not a very good personal life.Obviously he was a scientific genius. The explaination and discussion of his intellectual prowess left me sort of lost. I like physics and science but am just not very good at comprehending them. I feel that Isaacson does his best to explain on as basic a level as possible but I really did get sort of lost. Still, all in all a good book and worth reading in order to learn something about the man behind the myth."
4,"Overwhelming, but Interesting","I never had any clue about relativity or anything having to do with physics. Reading about Einstein and how he came to think about things in general isn't any easier to follow, but it's extremely interesting, so much so that one can get lost in the details about Einstein's life, and you'll find that the time spent reading this book passes quickly."
3,A Reasonable Effort,"Isaacson's biographical account of the life of Einstein gives us a wonderful insight into what was one of the 20th Century's best brains. To me this shows that the path to success isn't always straight as Albert spent time as a humble back office clerk. If you like to read about genius brains you might also likeAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert OppenheimerandThe Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atomand if you are into atomsAtoms, Sub-Atomic Particles, Space, Time and Other Cool Stuffand the universeThe Quantum Universe: (And Why Anything That Can Happen, Does)andThe Fragmenting Universe."
3,"great for those wanting to know about Einstein the scientist, but not so great for those wanting to know about Einstein the man","I just finished reading this book, I enjoyed some of the scientific detail about his work and got lost in understanding some of it, but overall I found it lacking in detail about Einstein as a man as opposed to Einstein the scientist. Overall, it read more like a history book than an actual biography and it was more difficult to get thru than I would have liked."
4,You don't have to be an Einstein to enjoy this book!,"You don't have to be an Einstein to enjoy this book but I sure wish that I would have taken physics instead of chemistry at junior college...Isaacson did a good job of trying to dummy up Einstein's discoveries so that JBODS like me could appreciate his genius but I do admit to having re-read a few sections here and there...Forget the geeky stereotypes that one leans toward when thinking of scientists - Einstein was a rebel and cool in every sense of the word. His humanity and adherence to the principle of individual freedom made him a great man beyond just the science that he pioneered.I especially enjoyed the way that religion, philosophy and science came together when developing and testing new theories. And the last chapter about Einstein's brain was entertaining in a macabre kind of way..."
4,Rich and engaging,"I love Walter Isaacson's biographies, and his telling of the life of Einstein does not disappoint. I enjoyed the first third of the book most, which focussed on his exploits in the worlds of physics, philosophy and academia. Beyond that, much of the book (And his life) was centered around socio-political issues. Interesting, to be sure, but not quite so up my alley as the theory of relativity.The book is a bit on the dense side, but no more than one would expect. After all, it attempts to sum up the life experience and extensive contributions of one of the most fascinating, brilliant and important people ever to live."
5,"Put it on your ""to read"" list. Do not miss out on a masterpiece!","Walter Isaacson is an excellent biographer. I have read his biographies of Benjamin Franklin and this one. Both are informative and an enjoyment to read. I plan to read all of his works. Including his recently released biography of Steve Jobs. The narrator of this book, Edward Herrmann, is excellent. I plan to do a search of books read by him and see if any catch my eye. It makes me feel content with the world that writers and publishers can get together to create such a masterpiece.After listening to the audiobook, I will probably buy this book just to have it."
4,An inspiration to budding scientists,"While a scientific background is helpful to fully appreciate Einstein's academic struggles and breakthroughs, the book is not meant to explain the theory of special relativity or quantum entanglement (though it does try). Isaacson references Einstein's own letters, speeches, and notes to show the transformation from a man with deeply troubled personal and academic lives to the most remarkable and revered scientists of our time."
5,Excellent in All Respects,"This is one of the best biographies I've ever read. The author not only explores Einstein's scientific accomplishments, but delves into his personal life and history as well. He uses previously unreleased sources to explore Albert's personal side. Whether you're familiar with Einstein's scientific achievements or not, you'll enjoy exploring the development of one of the greatest minds of the modern era."
5,Nice comprehensive bio of Albert Einstein.,It is amazing what access to personal papers can do for a biography. This is more than just a dry recitation of facts about his life and a rehash of his famous equation. This will likely take several sittings to get through but it's worth it if you've ever been curious about Albert Einstein.
5,A classic,"Biography and phisics, the life and the ideas of Einstein in their birth and development are masterfully analysed and outlined."
5,Gift selection,We bought this as a gift for a friend who loves to read and wanted a book about this man.
5,A truly deep look at Einstein,"I have always been fascinated with Einstein. I had originally gone to school as a Physics major and would have continued down that path had I not seen how many of the old Physics professors lived on the CMU campus. It was a sort of lonely, detached life that Einstein lived but much worse.This book was an excellent and detailed look at his entire career and personal life. With each chapter, you gain more of an appreciation for his leaps of intellectual prowess as well as his many personal stumbles. I gained a new appreciation for everything he contributed, both scientific and political, as well as for how human he was. I, like many, would have loved to have known him."
4,Introducing Einstein,"A very interesting biography for non-physicists like me who would like to better understand relativity, if at all possible... Einstein's genial theories are explained within their historical context, and the author provides extensive and pertinent biographical detail. It is most readable, and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in understanding new ideas in the twentieth century."
5,Engaging and informative,"A very interesting history dealing with both new, mind-boggling scientific horizons, and portraying the human side and individuality of the main character in a sympathetic and touching way. It goes to show greatness comes from qualities like imagination, an appreciation for simplicity, vulnerability, and fulfilment follows personal honesty and respect or awe for life and the creation as it is [observation without personal twists or agendas]. Why do I not know of any movies about Einstein as yet? It will probably take several movies just to cover the main themes."
3,Defective discs,Discs one and three did not play properly; the others were fine. If the discs were not defective I would recommend the audio book for its content.
4,Good but deep,"This is a thorough biography of Einstein. Being thorough, it goes into his disagreements with other scientists and explains the differences that they had, which means discussing the theories of physics over the years. At times, trying to follow the ""discussions"" took a lot of thought for this simple mind, but the author did a good job of explaining them so that even I could eventually follow them. It was enjoyable reading but I had to take my time to let thought processes sink in."
2,You better really like physics or Einstein to read this...,"I'm no mental midget, and I did well in high school physics, but this book just delved too deep for too long. Some of the scientific detail meant absolutely nothing to me--sailing well over my head. Even so, I believe I would have finished the book if it just wasn't so darned long. It finally just became too boring.However, if you have an IQ of 160+, or you have an intrepid interest in Einstein, I believe you will find this book outstanding. I learned some intriguing facts about Einstein, and the book struck me as extremely well researched.So why should you buy this book? If you love Einstein, are really into physics, or are looking for an impressive tome to display on your shelf. Otherwise, I recommend you keep looking."
3,too much fluff to get to the meat,"Maybe I am lazy but I was wanting more of a biography. This seemed to be almost too indepth, too much informtion, too much detail, too personal. If you really want to know the character, this fulfils this need exceptionally well. I wasn't looking for a soap opera. Author does a very good job of explaining Einstein's theories and how he came upon them. Sometimes it gets a little confusing when he shifts dates but after all this makes you stop and think back. I had to just put this book down for a few minutes and try to absorb or figure out what was going on, then continue. Not a pleasant read but I am glad I read it."
4,Einstein by Isaacson,Well written book for the lay person. Reveals many interesting aspects of Einstein's life and works. His works are presented in such a way that you don't need to be a physicist to enjoy the book.
5,a fun guy to hang out with,"Well, I still don't understand the Theory of Relativity. And I was hoping to gain an understanding of what would happen when you travel faster than light.Einstein seem to be a guy I would have enjoyed hanging out with."
3,You DO have to be a physicist.,Very well-researched and thorough. Too science-heavy. Could have been better outlined with appendices that go into the theories in depth.Will be appreciated more by science students and historians than by the regular avid reader. Does not have the narrative drive and hooks of McCullough's biographies.
1,stupid design,"Too small and very difficult to pump unless you have a super strong arm.Not recommended.Tried to return, it does not work."
3,lightweight,"The pump mounted easily to my bike, though the mounting strap assumes that the bike has a water holder built in to the bike already. (It uses the same screw holes used by the water holder.) If you don't already have the screw holes on your frame, you are out of luck using the supplied mounting strap. The pump itself is fairly easy to use. However, I noticed that it seems to pop off the valve stem too easily while pumping."
1,Don't waste your money,"This pump is terrible. My bike tires are supposed to be between 40 and 65 PSI...I can't get them past 35 with this pump. Every time I use it it's like a workout session. The guy that talks about his daughter, or grand-daughter using it, must've had an empty tire. At the beginning it's really easy to pump. But once it goes past 30 PSI, get ready for some fun.Now I'm going to buy an electric pump for just a few more dollars. And I suggest that if you're just looking for something to use at home and not carry around on your bike, you do the same."
1,Perfect for a flat tire,"That is, perfect for letting out whatever remaining air is in the tire. Totally unable to form a seal on the valve. Difficult to use under ideal conditions, I sure as hell wouldn't want to have to trust it in an emergency. Worthless piece of crap."
5,Pumps quickly and compact design perfect for bicycle,"This little unit is very sturdy and very easy to pump bicyle tires to capacity quickly. It easily filled my 26 x 1.95"" mountain bike tires up to 60psi. Though the pump goes up to 90psi, the pumping required a little more effort near the 60psi mark, but I definitely think it is capable. The compact design easily fit on my bike frame and the velcro strap was a bonus feature for secure attachment to the frame. I HIGHLY recommend this pump."
3,Back to Amazon,"The pump is nice work great on American valve, but the one I got can't lock and pump the French valve. I read the instruction and attempt to change flip the two internal parts in the pump head. Only able to find one internal part in the pump i get from Amazon. Maybe you will have better luck."
1,Agree with this pump is a POS,Like the other reviewer used no more than 4 times and would not attach to schraider valve anymore....waste of money.....DO NOT buy this Blackburn air pump!!!!
2,Don't buy this piece of junk.,"The holder will not keep the pump stable on your bike. The pump handle locks into the holder, and a velcro strap is supposed to keep the rest of the pump stable. On rough road, though, the pump will slide down from the handle and dangle off the bike. I have mine secured with duct tape now. Not pretty, and not useful for anyone who plans to use it regularly (Luckily, I have a floor pump to use at home)."
3,haven't had it for long,"pump works like it should, but as i said, i haven't had it for very long so i'm giving it three stars based on the fact that it works. the fourth and fifth star would be given if it lasted a long time (3-5 years)."
5,Nice piece of equipment,"I don't use this for cycling, but for my hand truck with inflatable tires. Anyway, this little baby hides away nicely and works flawlessly!"
3,"Works, But Has Quirks","I've had one of these for about six months. You can't beat it for portability, speed, and storage for the buck. It does have an annoying habit of locking up (part of this may be because my office is not air conditioned and the temperature fluctuates quite a bit.) Since it's FireWire, what I do when this happens is disconnect it and reconnect it. My Mac G3 just says, ""You disconnected a FireWire drive. Please connect it again."" When I do this, it starts working again. I've heard a few other people complain that their drives conked out on them, but Maxtor seems to be good about replacing them. I'll probably do this before the warranty expires.Be advised, by the way, that Macs prior to the G4 *cannot* be booted from FireWire, so don't think you're going to use this as a startup drive if that's what you've got. You *can* use it to hold the Classic/OS9 environment if you run OSX off your internal hard drive. OSX gets along beautifully with this drive."
1,Don't risk your data on this drive,The first one of these I bought wouldn't stay alive for more than a couple of minutes between power-ups. Maxtor kept telling me it was an incompatibility with my computer and wouldn't repair it even though I had tried a different firewire card and computer. I returned the drive for another one. The next one worked more reliably until recently and now it acts like the first one I bought. Maxtor won't admit this drive has flaws!
1,A Poor Personal Defense,"Sorry O.J. Your stories of racially-biased hate mail are touching. But that does nothing to convince me that you are innocent of the crime you were charged with in the respective criminal and civil suits. Nothing else in this book does that either. Why did O.J. feel he needed to write this? His innocence or guilt was to be determined by a jury, not by public opinion. His public reputation would have been tarnished anyway. Maybe he needed more money to pay for his set of ""dream team"" lawyers (now big-time celebrities as a result of this case). It's no surprise that it's out of print at this point."
2,He may say he did it or he may say he did not...............,This book is out there to give a guy a good name and make other's feel sorry for him. but we can not tell if he did it or not so dont judge.
2,Nobody Is Looking For The Real Killer,"There are many black and other Americans who have every right to play the race card. However, O. J. Simpson is not one of them. He had plenty of advantages in his life. Simpson's playing the race card is a sham and a tragedy. It was the only way to get away with murder. Oh well, our system of justice is not perfect. But, letting a guilty person go free is not the biggest problem with our justice system. The biggest problem is the approximately 10% of persons in prison who are innocent. It is far better to let a guilty person go free than to convict an innocent person."
2,Author Can't Make Up His Mind,"This novel is part adventure, part romance, part comedy. It never quite rises to the level of good enough in any of those categories. It's not a complete ship-wreck, but no one seems to have been steering this tanker."
3,Wired!,"Not a bad read, especially for a guy interested in all phases of the oil industry. I enjoyed the reference to the BP/ Diamond Shamrock joint off-shore gravel island venture-Mukluk. Like Masiel's Muktuk, this well was a dry hole, but at a cost of [...] billion rather than [...] million. I was troubled by what appears to be a sleepy editor. On page 63 the tow wire has a 5 inch diamater, pulling the barge a half mile back (page 63). On page 79 the radar on the following tug has the tow at 1 mile. On page 82 we're back to 1/2 mile, but with an 8 inch tow wire. A quibble, but unless I'm clueless about radar and the expansion/contraction properties of cable, these discrepencies should have been cleared up."
4,"Great, drive, poor instructions.","Anyways, this hard drive is a great one, VERY VERY good...I can't even hear it right now, and it is fast as hell. 9ms? Try about 2 or 4. And the capacity is great too, though I don't run a warez site, I do collect alot of programs and that means I need lotsa space, not just 10 lousy mb like my old drive. The only fault with this is with the manual. It goes take out, place on holders, poor poor diagram of screws, put in drive, another poor poor diagram of where screws should go, and then put in tape/power (no diagram at all!). And also they only send you half the screws you need. But it gets a 4 because it makes up for all this in drive quality. I recommend this drive for more intermediate-advanced computer people, novices get a different product or you will have to pay for a computer store to do it for you."
3,Wrong size of shoes,"Ordered Sebago shoes (had some pairs for years, very pleasant shoes, special wide size) from amazon.com and everything went very smoothly. Had my purchase in box at the front door within two or three days. Sadly, I ordered the wrong size, I should have ordered 9,5 WWW US, but the size and width chart of Sebago is not cristal clear. Regret my 190 euros purchase (incl. taxes and transport cost; normal price in US about 90 euros) and won't try buying directly from US again."
3,"Great looking shoes, but tight","I rarely wear Wide shoes. This, I went for a 9W and the toes still feel squeezed. And the paddings that go around the ""mouth"" of the shoe is very uncomfortable. They are thick (something that I would have appreciated at the bottom of the shoe) and rub against your foot constantly.But looks great though."
2,Another great world marred by terrible characters,"Jim Butcher definitely has a talent for fabricating interesting magical worlds, but just can't seem to create any interesting characters to populate it with. This book confirmed that for me. I picked up the series again because I had a good time with the role-playing game set in dresden universe. I got through the book, but just barely."
4,"Good book, delivered quickly, and as advertized","If you like Harry Dresden, you'll like this book. Yes, that;s a lame review. There are pl;ot subtelties and character developments that I really should comment upon. Of course, if I did I'd spoil the book. So, I'll just say, if you like Harry, you'll like this book! Go for it!"
5,Great books!,"Love this series! Great set of books, read them all! Harry Dresden is an excellent character and makes for one of my favorite reads."
5,"Hell's bells, a scary ride","""Hell's Bells!"", as Harry Dresden would say. Great fantasy, truly scary demon/evil stuff, humor to help relieve the tension, and one of the best love scenes I've read in years. Tender, lovestruck, broken-hearted Harry...You can't help but like him. And did I mention the wizard lore, action, religious undertones, a likeable mob boss, a spirit named Bob, and some vampires thrown in? Thanks Mr. Butcher, you write fun stories!"
4,Another fine entry in the series,"After a bit of a letdown with the last book, Butcher gets back to the strengths of the series - a mix of humor, action, suspense, and mystery, all wrapped around a fantasy label. In this one, Dresden tackles the case of the stolen Shroud of Turin. As usual, he gets mixed up in much more than that, and has to juggle numerous pressing matters along the way. We learn a little more about Marcone, the Chicago mob boss, at the end. It is a surprising and effective revelation, and builds another dimension to his character. Familiar characters return for this book, which is entertaining to the end. It isn't perfect, but this has developed into a very solid and consistently good series. Recommended !"
1,Death Mask,After reading all of the other Dresden Files I had looked forward to this one. Up until the end I was not disapponted but then the comment by a character that Jews were responsible for Jesus's death really upset me. This statement although not anti-semetic in itself has been used as a justification for the last 2 millenia to kill and persecute. To put this remark in a 21st century novel is certainly quite provocative if not down right irresponsible. Literary licence aside this could have easily been avoided. I wonder why it wasn't?
4,Three and a half stars,"I'd really like to give this one 3.5 stars. I enjoyed reading it, but it has not been my favorite Dresden book."
4,Deeath Masks,This story was a little dull and left me wondering why I read it. However I do enjoy the characters.
4,Duel with the Reds,"Death Masks brings back the Red Court, McCoy, Knights of the Cross and introducing the Order of the Blackend Denarians and the Archive. As if Harry didn't have his own problems with Vampires, the council, and other assorted Characters, now he has to take on the Denarians. Great concept and perfect Enemys for the Knights of the Cross. Cant wait to see more of the Archive and the Denarians. Excellent read. Poor Harry, so many things to do and so little time"
5,Series really gaining momentum,"Fans of Butcher, you know you'll like it. People looking at the series, this is where things really take off. Butcher excels at maintaining the pace of the various plot threads, bouncing around but still moving the story forward. The vampire war, his relationship with Susan, the ex-girlfriend turned paranormal warrior, and of course, the demonic foes that are almost invincible and plausibly appeal to Harry's darker side.Having read thru White Night, I find that the first 4 books lay the groundwork and the subsequent entries all continue the development of Harry's character from immature rebel wizard to somebody that is going to have a major impact upon the wizard community. Along the way, Butcher has developed some great supporting characters."
4,Harry love/hate relationship with Vampires just keep growing,"Harry is pretty much the same in this episode of ""The Dresden Files"" -- in some ways very unlucky but manages to survive some very nasty characters primarily with the help of his good guy friend.The Denarians are a great plot device and an introduction to a very interesting ""bad guy"".Harry is very predictable but entertaining. It would be nice for Harry to not be complete thick when it comes to women. It would really help develop his character and make more sense for someone who is a fairly intelligent person.Susan's development is quite interesting.Characters: 3 of 5Story: 4 of 5Pacing: 4 of 5"
5,Jim Butcher Dresden Files Wizards supernatural,Received book in great condition and in record time!Good reading that you don't want to put down!!Love getting things from amazon! Always a good experience!!
2,Soy candles,"The packaging was very nice. The aroma wasn't as I had expected. Could hardly tell there was an aroma. The candle burns nicely, no smoke, but you can't beat the small of a glade candle."
4,Great buy for four bucks!,Great for small spaces.....I used 2 instead of one in my living room.It also makes a great gift...
1,Have not got product,"When will I get this product, no tracking information, I am not sure why I can not track package,. I would love know where my order is?"
1,"Cheap,Horrible!!!!","ALL THESE CANDLES ARE CHEAP.EVERYTIME YOU LIGHT THEM,THEY START SMOKIN,AND FILL THE ROOM WITH BLACK SMOKE IF YOU DONT WATCH THEM!!YANKEE CANDLES COST MORE,BUT ARE SOOO MUCH BETER!!"
3,VERY LIGHT SCENT,"CANDLES (ALL SCENTS) ARE VERY LIGHTLY SCENTED. SINCE THEY BURN NICELY, THEY DO LOOK NICE WHEN COUPLED WITH ANOTHER CANDLE (S) THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A SCENT. ON THEIR OWN, NOT MUCH FRAGRANCE."
5,great smell and long lasting,"All smelled very good, plus they are soy so they burn longer and cooler and put less soot into the air."
3,MELTING CANDLES!!!!,I received my order for a few different scents of these candles. They DO smell wonderful even right out of the box. However when they arrived they were all melted!!! I stuck them in the fridge to harden them. NEVER again!
4,soy is the best,love the soy candles. They burn longer and cleaner. This was an excellent product and the seller sent it to me speedily.................can't wait to try some other scents.
5,"Amazing scent, amazing burn time and amazing price","I am a big-time candle-lover, but I hate paying big-time candle prices. I bought four of these Gardenia candles and the scent is just the right strength and not at all overpowering. The candles burn really clean, even and long. I will definitely be ordering more of these candles. I am a gardenia girl, but I might even give a few other scents a try. For the price, it's worth expanding my sniffing horizons."
3,"Ok book, but could have been better.","Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe my fascination with the palace at Knossos made me want much more. Ica was a good enough heroine, but I cared nothing about Jason of Massalon. The bull court, I felt,was poorly shown. And the ending was totally predictable. I prefer to stick with Mary Renault's ""The King Must Die"" to cover this time period. Sorry."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Dissonant sludge-thrash or something, with some kinda amateurish tech-death parts. The drumming is remarkably non-heavy. I don't think whoever produced this knew what they were doing at all. Or maybe I'm missing the point and I just don't get this kind of metal."
5,Reliable and motivating,"Here are a number of the features I like about this watch/heartrate monitor. I've used this solely for running.-Simple operation after the initial setup(put on heartrate monitor and go)-The cloth part of the chest band is washable-There is no metal that touches your skin so it doesn't make you cold on cold mornings-Lot of display options-Very easy to read screen-Lot of useful features (including interval timing, time in target Heart Rate zone, etc.)-You can have the option of setting a power save so the watch 'sleeps' if it isn't used for a certain number of hours."
1,"Nike HRM Triax C8 - poor quality, poor service","I purchased the Nike Triax C8 back in January. After 2 months of daily use it stopped working. I returned the unit to Nike's repair facility. It took 7 weeks for them to return the watch! Well I have been using it for about two months again and guess what? The watch dies in the middle of my run. I changed the battery, still the watch is dead. I will be going back to Polar, the most reliable brand of HRM."
1,Worse product and service I ever had,"Product.not reliable.battery went flat after 6 months. Replaced new one went flat again in 2 weeks. then worse, new battery only last 3 days.Service.Totally non available.Contact nike but reply was slow and was ask to contact local agent. Then local agent does not reply. No reply on whether will honour international warranty or not.My recommendation : Think twice before buying."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"If you are an absolute Wrightophile, then I guess you might want this book. You will not learn anything new about Wright, and you wont see any outstanding photography either. 195 pages of double spaced text. Not much bang for your buck."
3,Not for working firefighters.,I had this watch for about two weeks when I was out in the rain performing CPR and it somehow got water into the body of the watch. It is supposed to be water resistant up to 90m.
3,Too small,"This watch is nice but too small and very hard to read. I would not purchase this one again, sorry."
3,Watch Issues,This is the second watch i have bought from here. The first one the material that holds the watch tore after only 3 weeks of wearing it. The second watch same thing happened so i just had to buy a different strap for it . Then my backlight goes out . This is a good looking watch but very unreliable.
3,Nothing new from Talonsoft,"This game is ""West Front"" with different theme music! When I purchased "" Divided Ground"" I was hoping for a new and different game then ""West Front"", I purchased years ago. Boy was I wrong!!! Not only is this the same game, they did not make any improvements to the graphics, sound or game play! If you never played ""East front"" or ""West Front"" then you may find this game interesting. Keep in mind that this game has outdated graphics."
2,East Front Light,"This game is flawed. There are major glitches, like with a heavy truck, I can fire 1 million times in a turn if I want. Oops...That's not all, it is glitchy overall, and there are very few scenarios when compared to East Front II, West Front, etc. Disappointing."
2,Propaganda,"The Historical Narrative in the booklet, according to the credits, was written by the Israeli foreign Ministry. This is as one-sided as it gets. I expect a war game to allow you to play both sides equally enjoyably. Not so here."
3,Is it good? Great? or Bad?,If you like strategy games this one's is not the best but to someone it might intrest them. The only reason it isn't that good is because it'll take forever for someone to figure out how to play it. I've had it for 2 months and I still haven't figured it out but if you can it's really not all that bad.
5,This label maker is a steal.,"This Brother PT label maker was dirt cheap. A lot of machine for the money. The highest quality. I heartily recommend it.It takes eight AA batteries, if you choose to go portable. I chose to keep it on my computer desk and plug it into the AC outlet.As is usually the case, the manufacturer makes their money not on the machine, but on the necessary complimentary products, the TZ tapes. If you use this machine as much as I do, you will pay much more for the tapes than for the labeler. The manufacturer could afford to give the machine away. And they almost do.That's OK. The tapes are first class, just as is the labeler. They are always available at Amazon.com.I now have two Brother PT label makers. One on my computer desk, one in my woodworking shop. Along with my Brother FAX machine I have three top-notch products."
3,"Ok,","WEll,it's the same senario when you buy a regular printer...the base unit is cheap ann they make their money on the tape refills....My problem is,it seems to waste alot of tape if you print individual labels.For each 2.5"" label it cuts off 1"" of waste.!!!!Thats a 40% waste at our cost...."
4,"Works, But It Was Cheaper Several Years Ago","I purchased this from Amazon on March 22, 2007 for $89.99. At this point (10/18/12) the pricing has increased dramatically. Apparently Amazon is not carrying it in their own stock and outside vendors are supplying it. Seems strange that pricing on a gizmo like this would increase so much in five years... Today it is listed for $148.50. It must be a collector's item now.The unit works well. It's a little wasteful of the tape, as others have pointed out, but the printing is nice and compared to the old embossed labelers of old, this is a deluxe upgrade. I would not buy it at $148.50, but at the price I paid it was a relatively good value."
1,Contiously jams or doesn't print,"Piece of junk for me. It jams or doesn't print more often than it works. Sounded like a great label maker and wish I would of got one that ""works"" for other reviewers. Wasted tons of tape to just print out 1 or 2 labels at a time."
2,Still wastes too much tape = unforgivable,"The tape-wasting of all Brother label-makers is unforgivable. I'm not buying the 'label-curling' excuse from Brother, either. Yeah, there are work-arounds like the 'chain' setting, but why should it be necessary to do that?It's really a shame because the Brother label-makers are otherwise nice products with features that easily beat their main competitor (Dymo). But it's a big 'thumbs-down' for me because of the way Brother has designed in big, 1"" lead and trail margins specifically designed to waste tape for no other reason than to make the consumer buy more of their expensive tapes."
5,Great product!,"I have no experience with other label makers, but I can say that this product is easy to use. I have not been using it for very long so I cannot comment on the cost of tape, but after researching other label makers it seems to be an issue across the board. I love the fact that it comes with an AC adapter, this will save a ton of money in batteries. If I experience any issues I'll update this but so far, Loving It!"
4,Great labeler - versatile and easy to use,"I had a little battery powered only Brother labeler that died of old age, and traded up to this one. The ability to interface with a computer, the array of choices in fonts, font size, and width, and the automatic cutting make this very easy to use.Don't bother with the JV squad ones - get this and you'll be glad."
1,brother labeling machine,"Would not work on a Mac. Use it as a regular labeling machine, which costs a fraction of this price."
5,Great gathering-together of literary names,"I've always been interested in unusual names (though for girls more so than boys); in fact, the two girls' names which have been my favourites the longest are Easter and Echo. This book is for those of us who wouldn't mind naming a child Desdemona, Calliope, Lysander, or Perseus. The names in this book come from Shakespeare, Boccaccio, Dante, myths from Greece, Rome, Ireland, and Norway, and many other poems, plays, and novels from throughout history. Instead of having to look all over a bunch of books, like Shakespeare, Greek mythology, and 'The Decameron,' for example, you have all of these names right here, alphabetised and with little synopses of who this character was and what s/he did. Though the people who are into names like MacMadisonleigh and Quaitlynne probably won't like the names in this book, but who can argue with taste?"
3,So-So,They are soft enough for cleaning my cat's eyes and ears. I had to add a little water to the container because they were just too dry. Compared to other brands these are not any better or even as good and they're overpriced.
2,"Not bad wipes, but nothing special","These are not worth the money, I would recommend using regular baby wipes instead. They worked fine but did dry out quickly after opened. I use all the other John Paul Pet products but this one I will not buy again."
2,kids love it...but paper hands needs reinforcing,"This book is great, but much like every other book with flaps, i will never understand why the company does not invest a few more pennies and get the flaps reinforced with plastic. Sure the kids love it, but if you do one to many ""peek aboos"" then big bird and the sesame street gang have no hands....this makes peek aboo incredibly less exciting...."
2,Too flimsy,"I would actually not recommend this book. The tabs that serve as hands for the characters who play peek-a-boo with baby are too flimsy. My baby boy pulled them all out within a few hours. When something is described as a board book, I expect more heft."
3,lost in translation,I bought about 20 of these titles while in Australia and my son (almost 3) absloutely loves them. Of all his book choices in the house and he has lots these are the books he likes to read. My only gripe is that when the books were brought to the american audience they were altered a bit(americanized) and because of this they lost something about them that made them unique. I wont buy any more of them that were pinted in the united states and now beg friends to bring them back from England and Australia for me. If you never saw the overseas version you probably wouldnt notice the difference but if you started on the originals from overseas the american ones are disappointing. that is the only reason for the 3 stars otherwise i would give them an enthusiastic 5 stars
2,Good Start. Bad Finish!,"I agree with the reviewers who said that this Judith Michael book Pot of Gold book isn't good. It started off okay and seemed like it could have been really good but the more I read the more I didn't like this story. The main character Claire was okay in the beginning of the story but after that she became way too silly and like one of the previous reviewers said, she was too gullible! Also her 18 year old daughter Emma was a major brat and I just couldn't like these two characters!"
3,"A nice, easy read!","I'm glad to have discovered Judith Michael's books. I've read two and enjoyed both of them. There were a few parts in the book a little hard to believe! A virtual stranger, Hannah arrives at their doorstep shortly after Claire wins the lottery. She is welcomed into the home that same day and immediately becomes cook, counselor, and confidant for this mother and daughter. This was stretching it a bit... nowadays, would someone actually allow a stranger to become their housekeeper, caregiver, and confidant?? I don't think so!! But overlooking that, I thought the book was nicely written, with other characters quite believeable. Judith Michael is a good writer who keeps the story moving. It was an easy and enjoyable read. I find myself looking for other Judith Michael's books now. I would definately recommend this book to others."
1,What a disappointment!,"I'm a big fan of some of Judith Michael's other novels, including Possessions, Deceptions, and A Tangled Web. However, Pot of Gold was a real disappointment to me by comparison. It almost seemed like a knockoff written by some other author. The plot twists seemed thin and unbelievable -- for example, why on earth would Claire fall for Quentin, and Emma for Brix so fast? The men were hardly presented in an appealing way. There's just not nearly enough of the lush descriptions and tight characterizations present in other Judith Michael novels. On one page Claire and Emma are described as having a great mother-daughter relationship (which I believed), and then a few pages later Emma is acting like a spoiled brat and they're losing touch with each other, in a not very convincing manner. Don't waste your time with this book."
4,well written and great plot,I really enjoyed this book. The characters were excellantly written whereas you could actually picture them and feel their struggles as well as their happiness. The story was very good and it was very realistic. It actually brought you into the lives of the characters and I think many people feel like Claire and can relate to her life and style before winning the lottery and experience the same feelings as she did afterward. This was my first Judith Michael novel and I will be searching for another one.
4,A nice ice cream sundae,"The Kirkus Reviews article calls it cherry Jell-o with fake whipped cream, but I think it's more like a good ice cream sundae with all the toppings. ""What if you won the lottery?"" is a popular daydream for most people, and here, the authors give us a pretty nice example, not one of those horror stories you hear on Oprah or whatever of people who experienced hell after winning the big jackpot. And, the writing of Judith Michael is not ""awful"" - it's a lot better than Danielle Steele, for example, who's a truly bad writer. So, if you like nice fantasies - especially if you're a woman - and have had one of those ""what if I won the lottery"" daydreams, it's good reading."
3,Not too bad,This stuff wasn't too bad. I had another product and used it more than this. This stuff is very greasy. It is good and compact to carry around though.
5,perfect product,Great little tin to toss in a bag or pocket for application on healing tattoos any time. Smells nice too!
5,goo,this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product
5,Tattoo Goo Good,"I bought this for a recent tattoo after my tattoo artist recommended it. What impressed me the most is a few days ago, I burned my arm on the side of my gas grill. I did the same exact thing in the same exact spot a year ago. Last year, it took 3 weeks for the burn to heal. I decided to try the Tattoo Goo on it, and it is already almost completely healed after 3 days! This tin is a nice size that fits nicely in my purse. I love the natural smell of it, too."
4,"a little slow to arrive, but a GREAT product.",I love this product! My ink work healed beautifully. It smells great and feels good.
2,Gave me a rash,"I put this on the outline of my sleeve and got an itchy rash all over my arm, even where I didn't have tattoo. I guess maybe I was allergic. 2 Stars not one since not everyone will be allergic."
1,Horrible Stuff. Stick with the basics!,"The only good thing I can say about this stuff is it smells good. Other than that, it's junk for tattoos. I used Bacitracin the first few days after getting my tattoo. Then I tried the Tattoo Goo. What awful stuff! Talk about itching. Oh my God, I could have scratched my new tat right off! Instead, I washed it with gentle soap, dried it and applied regular lotion (Curel is good) and it was fine. I thought maybe the itch was due to the healing process, so I stupidly tried the Goo again the next couple of days. I got the same reaction each time. Horrible itching. Wash it off, dry it, lotion. No itching. It might be good for lip balm, but don't put it on your sensitive healing tattoo- you'll be sorry!!"
2,SMELLS LIKE SHEET,"got a tin of this, not sure of the healing properties yet, but i can tell you it smells like a can of sheet.. more like bend-ghey if you ask me."
1,Gross,"Do not waste your money on this stuff: YOU DO NOT NEED IT!!! Tattoo Goo is not a miracle formula, It will not make your tattoo heal faster. all it is, is a moisturizer, and a greasy one at that! Also, it's a little disgusting to stick your finger in a tin all the time! EW! Don't waste your money on Tattoo Goo, Beauty Supply Stores and Whole Foods have many alternative natural-moisturizers and lotions that work just as well but for less!"
4,Portable way to care for tattoos,"The first couple days after your tattoo I'd rather use A&D ointment as it reduces swelling and enables healing pretty quick. After the swelling goes down I switched to the goo as it's portable and really easy to apply. The goo has been making the after care a lot easier with no problems with itching, swelling, scabbing, commonly associated with getting inked. It washes off nicely and re-applying is quick. I like this stuff and would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of product. Bottom line... wash that tattoo between application of anything you put on and your tattoo will heal quicker and look better for years to come. I'd rate the goo a 5 but it doesn't really help with the initial swelling... it's more suited for keeping the mess down once healing begins."
1,Do not buy!!,"This card did not function well for me. I do video editing and tried to copy a 11GB file. It crashed Win2k. I've tested multiple times, and still didn't work.I ended up getting a Promise board (133tx), and worked like a charm. Makes me wonder about Maxtor, especially since it looks like they OEM from Promise. (Promise chips are on the Maxtor board)."
4,"Good board, incompatible BIOS","I spent three days trying to implement in my three year old 300 Mhz PC. Award 4.5 BIOS seemed to be a bottle neck. I could not access more than 30MB of my new 60Mb hard drive. Since I could access this through the mother board IDE, I am selling the board.It was a nice idea, just a limited system."
2,OK; Not Great,"Eagerly awaited arrival. Thought it was, from the pictures, exactly what we wanted. Unfortunately, it arrived without the bottle cover. After several inquiries, we discovered we could not get the cover and, therefore, decided to return. Frankly, we are sort of glad we were not able to get the cover. In retrospect, we believe it would be a ""hulking black thing"". Surely, with the top black cover, you would need a special placed to put it. As to quality, frankly, it seemed a bit flimsier and lower in quality than lower priced ones at Lowes and Home Depot, made by Whirlpool and GE. Perhaps it would have worked fine...we never plugged it in. So, maybe this is a bad rap. But, we returned it and bought a sturdier-appearing model for less money at Lowes...."
1,Very Disappointed,"Received Item very quickly, Did not come with a bottle cover, plugged the unit in after following all directions and there was no power. Amazon was very quick to respond to complaint. Currently returning the item."
1,Misleading/Incorrectly Titled,"I actually purchased this CD from another online retailer and reported the error to them (they accepted my return, I hope anyone who buys from here is as lucky). The title ""Glassworks for Piano Solo"" implies (to me, at least) this is a collection of solo piano transcriptions/arrangements of works from the original ""Glassworks"" recording. For those unfamiliar with it, ""Glassworks"" contained 2 solo piano pieces along with 4 pieces for ensemble. I've had the original since it first appeared on vinyl and was excited at the prospect of hearing solo piano versions of the 4 ensemble pieces. Unfortunately, this CD turned out to be a two-CD compilation of the original ""Glassworks"" recording plus Glass's ""Solo Piano"" CD - another recording I've had for years. I don't think there's anything malicious going on here, just a poor translation effort by whoever designed the CD package (It's a French Sony compilation)."
4,Highly recommended.,"Well, being born in one of those Central Belarussian towns I would say I agree with 95% of material and it's analized with good skills. I highly recommend this book to anyone with interest in Eastern Europe history and to descendents of Poles, Belarussians and Ukrainians.It is worth to remember that Commonwealth expirienced Ortodox( Uniates), Catholics, Protestans, Muslims(Tatar) living together in unity and friendship, while in Europe religious cleansings were at the peak.I was also surprised I didnt found any information about Sluck Fight against Bolsheviks( since it is very important to Belarus history) and general Stanislaw Bulak-Balachowicz, who declaired compliance with first Belarus Government in 1919, not with Poles...and after forcibly evacuating to Polish territories was unarmed by polish ""friend"" Pilsudski."
2,Deep history,"If you ever wanted to understand the exact political reconstruction that occured between Poland, Belarus, and surrounding countries, this book tells you more then you care to know in a way so difficult to comprehend that you'll feel less knowledgable after reading it. Not for casual historians."
5,The Sound of Heaven!,"Katerina Sitaras Makiej has the voice of an angel. Her CD of Byzantine chant is very soothing and beautiful. It is like being in heaven. Our church uses this CD for Orthros when our Cantor and choir are unavailable. Her voice is powerful, and fills the church with amazing heavenly music. I have purchased one for my enjoyment at home, as well as several to give as gifts. I am looking forward to Presvytera Makiej recording her next selection of hymns and chants."
4,Sampler Album - Not complete Hymns,"Very nice sound, but note that these hymns are incomplete -- many just one verse long. Some come in abruptly with no intro -- others cut out abruptly. I suppose this is some sort of a sampler."
3,Are they kidding us?,"4 episodes for $15?I watched it online. I know the Gaara story takes 32 episodes. I expect Viz to release it in two boxsets, each with 16 episodes. If they don't, they'll lose customers.If you're in a hurry, wait for the singles to go for $6 each.And go to Viz and vote for English captions. The kind with sound effects."
2,Simplistic and crude,"This game feels very simplistic and crude. The interface makes it look like it should be a freeware game. There isn't much of a gameplay to speak of. Basically you can go into one of four industries and try to become the next Boeing or Microsoft. The interface is very confusing, and the manual written in poor English."
4,Low Cost Tons of FUN,Don't go into this game expecting a bonanza of fancy graphics and cool openGL stuff. This a 2D strategy in the spirit of Civ. In fact not much has been changed from the free downloadable version but there are difrences. The game is remarkably adicting and loads of fun. Basicly your goal is to gain a certain market share in the world in a number of industries. You hire marketers and set up smear campaigns against your enemys and try to set up in essence the next microsoft or coca-cola. The game is a little dated even though it is a new product but if you like civ and are looking for a great deal this is a must.
4,A great idea with improvements needed,"This is a good, addictive game with all kinds of stuff to do. You can sell cars, Aircraft, computers, and cola. You can research technology to make your product better. You can also do all kinds of fun stuff. But the personalizing features do not exist. I was hoping to actually design my product. (Somewhat like an enhanced version of the old car company game, Detroit) But instead, the look of the product just changes once you research certain technologies. The game could have been a bit more detailed, a bit more realistic, and the AI could be a little smarter. Other than that, it's a good game. It's definitely worth the $... I got it for."
4,Love the album love the band !,Love this album !!!!! The cover of First Rock Star on the Moon is both tribute and a takeover of the song originally done by The Brats of NYC....Also a ton of great VB's original songs on this disc... Tongue Tied.... June Apple ...Bad Mouth....
4,decent intro to chromatic harmonica,There are not many books for chromatic harmonica so I was pleased to find this intro. It covers music notation and has well paced exercises even for those who already know how to read music. I did not give it 5 stars because I think it could have benefitted from having more well known tunes to practice besides the music drills. I am sorry I did not know there was the possibility of purchasing the version with a CD.
2,It is not an introductory material.,"If you are looking for a set of notations, accompanied by CD -it is your choice.If you need some step-by-step introduction, it is not what you are looking for."
2,A Sad Disappointment,"From the title of the book, I expected some sort of instructions on how to play chromatic harmonica. The book is primarily music that you can play, with only three short pages of nearly useless instruction that amounted to ""blow into the harmonica to make a noise; inhale to make a different noise; and push the little button to make still other noises."" They didn't give much information about how to produce actual music, nor how to follow the written music.I suppose I should have used the option that Amazon has of looking inside of the book, before I clicked to buy it. Live and learn."
5,Works great,"I have installed 5 of these AMPs over the years at the restaurants that I run. These are great for powering backgroung music speakers. They are very heavy, sturdy and built like a tank and the oldest one that I have is already 5 years old with absolutely no problems. I will continue to purchase, use and recommend this amp to anyone that needs a 70V/100V amp for background music."
5,"""And When I Say Obey You Will...""","Latex Cult is the follow up record to Impaled Nazarene's most diverse recording to date, Suomi Finland Perkele. Latex Cult is the first album not to feature original drummer Kimmo Luttinen (he was replaced with Reima Kellokoski). Kimmo wanted to take the band in a less ""nuclear"" direction. This release features 14 tracks of hate and punk inspired nuclear metal. Motorpenis, Violence I Crave, Punishment Is Absolute, I Eat Pussy For Breakfast and Delirium Tremens are particular standouts. Also, Mika's lyrics are not to be missed....""Women of all ages and races are begging to be my love slaves."""
4,OLD Man - VHS,"This is a great movie. Caught it on the Hallmark channel some years ago. Unable to find it on DVD. Nice story. Good for most audiences. Title refers to the river, not a character. Would recommend. Would actually rate this 4 1/2."
5,BOUGHT WRONG BOOK BUT GLAD OF IT,"Everyone in my class bought the 4th edition of this book. However, the material is very similar despite the chapters being slightly off. Somethings in the 4th edition were given their own chapter. However, the 3rd edition has just as much current and up to date information. If you want a cheaper version of a new edition this book may be a low cost option for anyone low on cash who wants to start a CNA program or even study for the exam on their own. Very thorough and informative."
5,Great Book!,This book is absolutely great. It has extremely helpful review questions with the answers in the back to quiz yourself. Highly recommend it!
5,Perfect CNA instruction,"If you are taking the CNA Class for certification this is very helpful. It comes with a CD but I haven't listened to it so I'm not sure what is on it. Most colleges don't ask you to buy the workbook with this book so if you are shopping, this will be all you need unless instructed differently."
5,Brings Back Memories,"Wow, I just came across this movie while shopping at Amazon and was so excited to see it on your web site. For many years, I showed this movie to my 4th graders (when teachers used 16mm movie projectors). I never got tired of showing the movie and watching the students in awe of the little boy and his adventures with the red balloon. It is a captivating story for any child and as the other reviews show, it is unforgetable."
4,"My first foreign film, facinating.","In the 1960's (?) there was a TV show hosted by (of all people) Kukla, Fran and Ollie, called the International Children's Film Festival. It was wonderful and this was one of the first films shown. It has always lead me to look for foreign films as an exciting alternative. Wish they could bring the series back. Anyway, this was one of the titles I can recall, along with ""Skinny and Fatty."" Try it, you'll like it."
5,Third generation gift,"When I spotted this classic on video, I immediately bought it for my grandkids. Actually, I discovered it in Paris as a 20-something, and love it still, young at heart years later."
5,Finally!,This has been a long time coming. It was released on DVD a few years back by some company just to make a buck. The quality was terrible I kept my VHS copy. This is enthralling story and to know it will be out and remastered I give it five stars. This movie has such heart and essence.
5,awesome film,"The only complaint I have is this film should have been released sooner. A cinematic treasure that is as timeless as love and friendship. I saw this film for the first time back in early elementary school, and it stayed with me to this day. One of the few films worth owning."
5,Fly away with Pascal!,"What can I say. This is a remarkable little film that tells a story both humorous and touching without saying a word. If you love hope, love, innocence and faith that all will be well, this is for you."
2,Red Balloon Burst,"This is one of the finest short films ever made. Unfortunately, Janus Films opted to use a copy of the film with a defective sound track to make this DVD. I do not understand the mechanics of a film's sound track, but it seems to me that they could have found a better copy to use. Has the copyright run out on this film? Surely the original producers would have been wise enough to avoid this catastrophe. The music is an integral part of the film; it is what ties the various themes together. Shame. Shame.Joel Emery"
3,Alternate opinion: it gave me nightmares,"When I was a little kid, I saw this movie at school. Is scared the fecal matter out of me. The red balloon was an inanimate object, to my tiny literal mind, and therefore should not display any signs of cognizance. I was terrified of animate inanimate objects for YEARS afterwards. Then in the end when the boy is kidnapped by all those balloons that put me right over the edge. I was petrified. He was snatched away by balloons that were going to take him to who knows where? What was he going to eat? Where was his mom? What if the balloons popped and dropped him on the ground?Now as an adult I see the beauty of the movie and the message and all, but beware that kids sometimes don't interpret these things the same way."
2,Disappointing on an adult level,"After reading all the glowing reviews I was determined to see this movie. I genuinely love the classic children stories and hoped this would be another to add to my favorites. But I was wrong. I was completely unmoved by the boy's predicaments or the demise of his balloon, and it normally doesn't take much to make me cry! To be fair, I can imagine a preschooler enjoying this one. And I suppose if an adult had seen this as a child and had fond memories of the film, he or she would enjoy a repeat viewing. But an ""old"" newcomer like me found it of little interest."
5,The Red Balloon,"One of the all time great films. Although it was made over fifty years ago, it stands up just as well today. Equally enjoyable for children and adults. Excellent cinematography. Charming."
1,The Red Ballon,A real disappointment. It comes across as a sloppy copy taken off of the screen of an 8mm film copy of the original.
3,"Great movie, horrible print","I saw this movie as a boy and insisted my mother take me again every time it was shown at our local art center.I love the movie but this print was beyond terrible. Focus is bad except for all the dust, scratches, lint and heat boils they managed to capture. Shame on me for buying a Korean import but I have not seen any other prints available."
5,Simply Exquisite,"Watch in awe as young Pascal has one adventure after another with a balloon that seems to have a mind of its own. Beautifully set against the beckoning landscape of Paris, this film is truly a classic for all time. A beautiful child, a beautiful story, a beautiful setting--no words are necessary for us to understand and feel the joy and emotion being conveyed through this film. A true masterpiece."
1,grade school nightmare,"My grade school owned two movies, one about a boy left to run a donut shop where a lady loses a diamond bracelet and this horror. I used to cringe when it rained or was to smoggy to play outside(L.A. in the 70s). They would trot out this dreck at lunchtime when we were trapped(like rats) inside and all the kids would just scream. There would be 20 of us hiding in the bathroom just to avoid. I just remember it being depressing, the bullies were awful and it just made me sad. It is depressing and dull. When it popped up on my recommended list I actually cringed. BAD. BAD. BAD."
2,stupid,i remember this stupid movie.i may have blocked it from my memory if all my teachers didn't show it when they were absent and make us write 5 page papers on it.
5,Perfection,"I think this move is just perfection. I love the story line, the music and especially the scenery of 1950s Paris."
2,Freezes Up,I purchased one of these drives to help me migrate from one computer to another and then to store digital video files for editing purposes. The problem is the drive freezes up from time to time. To get it working again requires a complete power down of the system and a reboot. This can be a real pain when you are working on a 90 minute MiniDV project.
2,"Slow, noisy and almost useless.","I'm going to return this drive as soon as possible. It took 45 minutes to copy 600 megabytes from a CD. My internal drives would do the same task in relatively no time. I've had to restart repeatedly and the drive makes intermittent hard ""clock"" sounds. It sounded too good to be true, and I guess it was. Maybe it's just a defective unit."
2,It's a great drive when it works,"...I've got one attached to my iBook, and I loved it for the first three months or so. Nowadays it tends to not wake from sleep mode. I have to unplug it from the computer, then from the power brick and let it sit there for five minutes or so.Maxtor was completely lost when I contacted them for tech support.I'm still using it for software and music archives, but I keep all my really important projects elsewhere in case it finally decides not to wake up."
2,Unreliable and poor customer service,"As others have pointed out, this is not a very reliable drive. It worked most of the time with my Windows machine but never with my Mac. Worst of all, I need a replacement power cord and the best Maxtor could do to help me was to say, ""We do not have this item. See if you can find one on the internet."""
5,"Mind Control Studios, We love this drive!","I bought one of these drives for our facility and its great!Fast access times, plug and play, runs like a champ. We haverun DV compressed video on these drives and never had a droppedframe. I want to stack 13 of these drives and have a fullterrabyte."
1,Can't Count on It,"I gave up trying to rely on this drive. I've had the drive a little over a year so it's out of warranty. I didn't use it often, maybe just about 30 hours of usage. The drive started making a clicking noise and sometimes doesn't spin up and I can't access my data. For two weeks it didn't start then finally on one day, it spun up!I left the drive running for a few days with no problems and removed all the data. I scanned the disk for errors and reformatted without any problems. Good... so I shut it off and moved it to another computer and the $*)@&% thing won't spin up again. I give up.Maxtor support was really good but basically told me I was out of luck because of the warranty. They don't repair them but will send you out a new drive.Some advice... Keep the drive running all the time, if it's a hardware problem, it will fail within it's warranty."
1,Slow Performer,"I purchased this drive to capture video, and after getting very poor results, ran a drive test routine from Pinnacle on the drive. Using a 100M file size, the average write is 2.46 MBytes/sec, minimum 1.4 MBytes/sec, and maximum was 9.6 MBytes/sec. Since this is well below the 3.6MBytes/sec sustained rate needed to support an uncompressed digital video capture,buy a different drive if you are thinking of using this for video."
2,NOT compatible with Premiere 6.0,"Though this device serves well in mass storage, many problems are created when used in video editing with Adobe, especially computer lock-ups! With over 4 hours in phone calls to Sony VAIO and to Adobe it was determined by Adobe that there were no fixes available to cure the Maxtor problem. In fact it was recommended that I no longer use the Maxtor with Adobe. Something about incompatibility with ""transfer rates"".....I guess I'll need to find secondary purposes for my Maxtor...."
4,Wonderful illustrations,"Ernst, the blue crocodile, wants to collect things. His brother Sol, a green crocodile, collects many different kinds of things.The little blue crocodile thinks and thinks of the different things he can collect and decides that he wants to collect puddles. And he discovers that there are so many different kinds of puddles: shadow puddles, star puddles, cloud puddles, flower puddles and so much more.Ernst uses his imagination and creativity to collect something that normally couldn't be collected. And along the way, Sol, learns to appreciate his brother's ideas.The illustrations are busy, bright and provide children the opportunity to peruse the pictures and put names to new things.Children and adults will enjoy sharing the adventure of Ernst and his collection.Armchair Interviews says: Elisa Kleven is a children's book author and illustrator of many award-winning multicultural picture books."
3,Not for me.,"The workout itself is OK. You will work up a sweat and feel it in your legs and abs but it is not a lot of fun. Also, there is not a lot of cueing, the music is boring and repetitive and the camera angles are terrible."
3,"Fun, but not good for Beginners","To start, I have absolutely no dance experience at all. This DVD does not teach you HOW to dance, but uses a sequence of dance movements to give the viewer a good workout. There are 3 levels... beginner, intermediate, and advanced. If you're like me, and don't know how to dance, it will probably take you some time to go through and figure out what exactly they are doing with their feet! But once you figure it out, this DVD is SO much fun to do. I use this to motivate me into exercising when I don't feel like doing anything else!I would give this DVD 5 stars if they did a better job at explaining what they're about to do (especially for the ""beginner"" section.)"
3,Need more,Edyta needs to do more explanations of the steps; it's as if she assumes her viewers know them. I would have liked Alex to have taught as well. Good workout however
2,Disappointing,"Poor instruction. Slow-motion help does not break or slow down the steps adequately. During routines, instructions are given with directions for the dancers behind he instructors -- not the DVD viewer."
3,A little too slow,"This DVD is a little too slow for my taste. Even the advance section is not that difficult and you can't get a great workout out of it. I would recommend the DWTS DVD's instead. Sorry, even though I love Edyta."
4,"Good workout, not so great technology","I really like this workout. It's very different from your standard cardio and, although cuing may be a little lax at times, it's easy to follow (for the most part). Not only can you choose from different workout levels, you can choose which of the dances to do in each level. That makes it easier to get a short workout if needed. The only thing that I don't like, and it is a fairly large inconvenience, is that you can't pause, rewind, or otherwise navigate. While that may not seem like a huge deal, it is extremely irritating when your phone rings and you have to choose between starting the dance over later or taking the call."
4,Great Workout and Learning Some Real Steps,"I found this to be my favorite of the current three ""DWTS"" DVDs I have purchased thus far. It has three different levels, and a ""help"" in slow motion for more explanation. It's more difficult than the DVD hosted by Ashley, Max and Kym, but it's a lot of fun. It does perhaps lack the warmth of that one--which is charming, but simpler. This one has really helped me tone, esp. my lower body and core."
2,Didn't like it,"I found it pretty hard to follow. Dvd assumes you have more knowledge of dance terms than I do. Everything is at tempo, if you want to see it slow, you have to go to a special help section. Each section felt kind of repetitive too."
4,Easy upgrade for an old computer,This Maxtor 20 gig is a good upgrade for our older Pentium PC's. We upgraded some software and needed more memory. This was a good compromise for group of 4 older pentium pc's without upgrading the processors. But we did replace the RAM.It's fairly easy to install and the MaxBlast software will print out instructions. Be sure to set your jumpers and don't mix up the primary and secondary master cables. Otherwise it's a piece of cake.
2,Maxtor give you trouble to keep their warranty,"I had this product on my computer. It crashed recently. When I go thru their warranty process, I feel Maxtor just don't want to replace it."
5,fast and quiet,"Great purchase. This drive is inexpensive, fast, and very quiet. I purchased this drive to replace my old Quantum Bigfoot 5 1/4"" 11 gb drive and it's been great. It's cheap enough to consider using it as a second hard drive too."
5,Outstanding Text,"I am a professor and have used this book in one of my classes for preparing managers of training. This book was especially helpful in understanding strategic planning for those who have not been involved in that process previously. It provided several models that can be used to plan strategically the needs of the organization of which talent, is the most critical and difficult factor within an organization to plan for. It is also one of the only books that addresses the issue of people and talent development as a strategic need. It provides a rationale for talent development and an updated review of how the field of training has evolved into Workplace Learning and Performance. The reviewer who was so disappointed with this book probably doesn't understand how these roles have changed. Training as it is tradionally known, would have no need for understanding the criticl nature of talent development. It's time to move into the new millenium!!"
2,Starts out good....,"I got through 5 chapters out of 12 before the ideas started to become repetitive and muddled. It was like someone who talks very fast, sharing every thought and theory without a clear idea of the desired outcome. Way too much jargon and Phrases That Were Needlessly Capitalized. Maybe useful as a text book, but for somone looking for a clear process to assist my organization, it really missed the mark. Oh, and the book started to fall apart the second time I picked it up."
2,Good information poorly organized,"I purchased this textbook for a doctoral level HRD Policy Seminar class. My main criticism of the text is that it is poorly written. While the ideas and concepts in the textbook are valuable any concrete sequential learner will be quickly frustrated when trying to extract core concepts. Perhaps concrete randoms will do better? The softback edition is cheaply manufactured and a after few readings the binding is coming apart. If you are searching for a textbook on HRD strategic planning, pass this one over."
2,Review of Nikon CL S2 pouch for lens,"I don't think this product is done by Nikon since it has a grey color (all the other pouches from Nikon that I've seen are black).It is ok for the color.But what made me rate this as 2 over 5 is the way you have to open and close the pouch. Again, it is different from the usual Nikon pouches. With this design, you have to pull the button seen on the right of the picture very hard towards the center to close the pouch, and then you have to adjust the cloth which will be gathering in front of the button, and then pull the botton once again, and again.Frankly, I am not able to easily and completely close this pouch. As much as i try, there will always be an opening of about 2 cms, enough to let dirt enter...I don't recommend it when you have the option of getting the usual black Nikon pouches."
2,A bear to clean,"I wish this grill was a better product, because it certainly is a great way to cook fish, etc., but the surface is impossible to clean completely. Also, it warped, and on our Kitchenaid glass-top stove it no longer lies flat. This product is really not up to the Calphalon standard."
3,Decent Pan,"Made in China, this pan lacks the true quality of American made Calphalon pans. The interior has still a decent finish, with good quality anodizing, providing an ideal cooking surface. The handle is rough cast stainless. The bottom of the pan has all the indentation lines that form the ""grill"" suface, and has a very rough, poor texture. It works well enough, but I don't think this pan truely caters to the ""Collector."""
1,not real calphalon,"I bought mine because I trusted the calphalon name. but when I took It out of the box I knew something was wrong, It did not feel right, Its much to light which will cause your food to stick, making more work for you when Its time to clean up. this is not commercial cookware and should not be advertised as such.I'm sending mine back."
4,Great little grill pan,"This is a great deal for a quality piece of Calphalon cookware, that normally costs way more than what amazon is selling it for. Please note, this is not a non-stick cookware - and cleaning is not quite so easy.To help with cleaning, after removing the food you've cooked, keep it on the heat, and add some water and continue heating. This will loosen up any pieces that have stuck to the pan. Or, better yet, make a sauce by deglazing the pan: After you finish grilling, remove the excess fat, add a small amount of liquid, (like wine, stock, lemon juice, sherry, etc) to the grill pan and start stirring. Get into the grooves of the pan with a wooden spoon to get all the bits up into the sauce.Oh and it's important that you remove the pan from the heat when adding anything alcoholic so you don't burn your face off!"
3,Non Stick complaints,"I have used this pan for 2 months. I never wash any frying/grill pans with soap.. just water. Never put them in a dishwasher. Yes, at first it looks like the pan is ruined, but after about 2 weeks it develops a hard, stick resistant surface that will let eggs slide off. You should never wash a high temp pan with soap, unless you want to scrub it every time you wash it. High temp surfaces do not need to be sterile... they get to 400F and higher.. enough to kill anything.I agree this pan is NOT the usual Calphalon quality. But if used as above it will work fine. Also, if it warps... beat it back flat with a hammer. It can take it."
2,treat it like cast iron,After weeks of fussing and scrubbing I finally tried to season this pan like cast iron. Since then I have had no problems. It looks ugly but after proper seasoning and NEVER using soap or a scrubbie the pan works fine. Just oil and store after rinsing with hot water. I agree this is DEFINEATELY NOT up to Caphalon standards.
4,Nice Historical NASA Docuement,"This relatively small paperback, was published in 1965 by NASA, to explain the mechanical engineering aspects of spacecraft design to a general audience. Some of the topics covered in this book are thermal control systems, electronics packaging, stress analysis, lubrication, etc. While many of the topics in this book are dated, especially the electronics section, this book is an important historical document that describes the early era of NASA and its spacecraft designs.It is important to note that while this book has been out of print for many years, it is possible to fine many excellent quality used copies of this for between $10 - 25."
5,Exceptionally Moving,"This memoir was very moving and inspiring to me. I find the histories of people during World War II fascinating and troubling. I wonder how it would have been to live at that time under such difficult moral, ethical, and physical difficulties? What would my decisions be in the same circumstances? This book captures one woman's experience of living as a German citizen in Germany during this time period and her small ways of bringing hope and help to others at the threat of her own life if caught. Frau Zassenhaus, to me, is a true heroine, as are others who assist her in the book. While not a ""feel-good"" book, I did, however, find it a hopeful book. It has become one of my favorites since I first read it several years ago. I highly recommend it."
1,"Very Childish, Reads Like A Childs Novel","If you are even remotely looking for a book with BODY & Maturity & Informative, PASS this one up ! After reading at least 180 pgs. I had to give up . It would be a good novel for some young child [ 10-14 yrs. old], but not for someone with a remotely Mature Mind. There is no Meat On The Bone here. Supposedly it is a true book, on a scale from 1 - 10 ,i would give it a 1/2 at the MOST ! After having read so many great books on the Holocaust / WW2 / Espionage / Nazi Germany etc. , i felt like throwing it in the trash, what an absolute WASTE of TIME !!!"
1,Horrible Support,"Here I am, out of town with my phone, my laptop and my bluetooth adapter. The bluetooth adapter software is installed on the home computer, but not the laptop. ""No problem,"" I think to myself, ""I'll just download the drivers.""WRONG! Motorola, unlike most consumer-friendly technology vendors, does not make their drivers available online for ALOT of their products. In this day and age, there's no excuse for not making drivers available for download as a part of your customer service. This is a true failure on Motorola's part.I'll definitely remember this when I'm looking to buy products in the future!"
3,Don't lose your disk,"Product work fine once you figure out it's little idiosyncracies. Had a lot of trouble getting the computer to recognize the adapter whenever i unplugged it. Had to remove and reinstall the software on occasion. Also remember once it tells you that a connection has been established you may still need to press the button on the RIGHT side of the headphones (Motorola HT820) to hear anything. Would recommend it if you can get it at a good price like i did, but would not buy it retail."
4,Not as bad as they say....,"This little unit works great for me along with an H500 bluetooth headset. I use it for making calls via Skype and have had great success. I bought mine used from another very large online auction site and also didn't receive any drivers.A resourceful and web savvy internet user could have easily found them and had them installed in less than 20 minutes....At least that's what I did. Lot's of folks have them posted on FTP servers and other locations. They are out there, you just need to put forth a little effort in finding them.My experience with this product has been just fine."
1,Get with the program,"Like others, MOT policy of not making the software available online stinks. I bought mine in Salt lake City while working there for a number of days - and I think I left the disk in the packaging I threw out when I left.The phone support was OK, and we got it working on my laptop - sortof - but the sortof I think was related to the poor wireless in the hotel.. Anyway, I'm home with no disk, and they want more for the disk than I paid for the unit. I think I will also return this, inspite of how much I like it, in protest. maybe if MOT gets a few hundred back, they'll wake up and do the right thing."
1,Crashed my computer,The software didn't install properly and when I updated the driver through device manager the upgraded driver crashed Microsoft Windows 7 and I had to reformat my computer and start all over.
4,Unit provides freedom to move around,"This USB device eliminates the wire from the PC to the headset via bluetooth wireless transmission. As with most bluetooth devices, pairing is not always easy, but the software interface helps with this setup. The sound quality is excellent and no noise is introduced by the device. With the Motorola S805 DJ headset, you can controll the iTuens playlist and change volume with the built in controls. The range of this unit is about 40 feet indoors."
1,same old driver issue,"Like many others have already posted, the driver is not available online. I purchased it and wanted to install driver on the airport as Albuquerque airport has free internet. Well, driver was not available on the net. I do have the cd but my laptop does not have a cd-drive (its one of those compact 12 inch laptops with no cd-drive). So, I am out of town not having access to my extrenal cd-rom drive and as the software is not installed I cannot use the device's wireless capabilities. I am already thinking of returning it to compusa once I get back home."
3,Okay,"I wanted a universal touch screen remote for two main reasons, the touch screen function and to replace my Dish Network remote, which is unreliable. The Sima remote was just ""okay"" in both cases. The touch screen is not very consistent as far as sensitivity is concerned, nor is the lighting effective. The Satelite remote capabilities are limited, in that the program, review, and other buttons are not readilly transferable to the universal."
2,stay away from touch-screen layout,"Well, it looks really cool on a picture does not it? When you actually use for a couple a month or even less you would regret that you EVER bought this universal control. As any touch-screen device the glass on this thing get so dirty because they dont give you any pen/pencil to press on buttons so you just have to use your fingers.If something spills - this is a history. ALso it does not work for all model TVs so if you have Toshiba or any other model you better get ready to run back to the store for a refund!"
3,"It's contents are okay, but the quality","of the paper and photos are wonderful,just not my style-too rustic."
4,An Interesting Look at an Unusual Side of Criminal Justice,"This book is an interesting look at a side of the ""criminal justice"" system that is rarely, if ever, examined from the point of view of this book. There are a number of books regarding the criminally insane written by doctors,and by ""true crime"" writers but this is the first I have ever seen written by, and from the perspective of an attorney.The writing is well done, and the book is easy to read. It isn't written in legalese so that anyone can read it and enjoy it. The author did a wonderful job of presenting a variety of cases and was not shy about his hesitancy to deal with certain of those cases. He also provided some interesting insights into the problems faced by the ""criminally insane"", the attorneys who represent them and the system and offered a number of solutions to these problems.This is a book well worth reading, particularly if you are interested in mental health or criminal justice."
1,A Terrible Book From A Dispicable Author,"I found this deeply disturbing but not very interesting. Disturbing because the author seemed proud of his role as an advocate for the most dangerous and destructive members in our society. Proud that he used technicalities, character assassination and outright falsehoods to free people who he himself knew to be dangerous. I was disinterested because the book is not a serious work about the work of an attorney for the mentally deranged but a chatty verbose blow by blow of certain trails and hearings the author participated in. The crimes of the defendants and the suffering of the victims are given very little space, while the courtroom `dramatics' and his actions to aid the deranged are highlighted. Most disappointing, he admits to changing details of the stories to suit `dramatic effect'' given this, what is the point?"
3,If I knew sooner,"If the description of the product was clear on all parts included my experience would have been better. I love the bed today, easy to assemble, beautiful color. It does not include rails! You have to purchase these seperately. I found them on amazon."
5,Lightweight but heavy duty,I've been doing construction for twenty years and have used many drills. I was a devoted Dewalt man until I got a hold of this drill. It's very well balanced and is very lightweight. It has great power. The drill is very comfortable and is a pleasure to use.
5,A very well designed driver,"After my 12v makita drill needed a new battery, I decided that it made more sense to puchase a new drill, than it did to replace a 12v battery. I looked at makita,dewalt,panasonic and milwuakee drills( I,m one of the few lucky person to have a berland tools store nearby, so I can see and touch the drills.)To me the bosch felt the best in my hands and the bosch weight was the same as my 12v makita. I know that some of the drills, I mention above have gotten 5 stars. But when I found out that I could purchase this awsome bosch drill for 125.00(you have to purchase 150.00 to get $25 off your purchase, this offer expires 10/31/06).So far, I have used the drill for light duty work. I know that if I was happy with my 6 year old makita drill, that this bosch(with all the new technology) will keep me happy for years to come."
2,Errors in book detract from its value,"Nice photos, but how much faith can you put into the text when simple errors stick out like sore thumbsFor instance:Man Called X: Ken Thurston did not have a girlfriend and had nothing to do with the Cafe Tamborine (that was an entirely different program.)Jack Moyles did NOT replace Frank Sinatra as Rocky Fortune. That series ended when Sinatra left it. Moyles DID star in Rocky Jordan, an entirely different show.It is little things like this and make the book suspect for me. How many more errors are in this book? What can one take as fact and not with a grain of salt?Excellent concept, faulty execution. I would not buy this book again and am considering returning my copy for credit. I do not consider this book to be a valuable reference item. Casual reading yes...reference work...no"
1,"Better than his earlier edition, but.....","Mr. Lackmann has improved this book very much from the earlier edition which was loaded with made up facts and apparently little research. Mr. Lackmann, in his acknowledgements, though has not given credit to the many readers who had written him to correct his mistaken information. He acts as if somehow these facts were miraculously corrected by themselves. There are better reference books on radio than this one. Don't waste your time."
1,Nearly useless.,"The only useful thing about this infuriating -- and inaccurate-- book is the selection of photos. Otherwise, get Dunning."
2,Wright door closer V150 black,This door closer does not work in temperatures below about 15 degrees. Colder than that the door slams shut with great force shaking the doorway and house with a loud bang. The door closer never bothers to cause the storm door to slow down as it almost reaches a closed position to gently position it into a fully closed position. Could it be that Wright's engineering dept. never bothered to test this device in low temps for its functionality? Unacceptable!
5,Lovely Print,"I was so delighted to receive this print, lovingly packaged in brown paper and a triangular art box. Since the print was part of a birthday gift for a friend, I was very pleased to receive in pristine condition.Exactly as described. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,When you need something more than iMovie.,I use this with a MacBook laptop with 2GB RAM without any performance issues. It is a great product for when you have outgrown iMovie but don't need the full feature set of Final Cut. I use it for both perosnal and work video production. No problems connecting and moving video of a Panasonic PV-GS500 video camera via Firewire. There is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master.
3,Runs way too large,"Gave this to hubby as a gift. Like the look and the feel, but even after a couple of washes and dryings...it's still too big. Wish I'd known before they sold out."
3,Antistatic bags,25 pack of bags. They are smaller than most devices. I use them mostly for small drives like floppy or small NICs. 6x10 bags are better
4,Nemesis vs the Beastmaster,"Okay, so Ian Zierig doesn't give this movie a whole lot ofrespectability, but where else can you see the Nemesis (OlivierGruner) battle it out with the Beastmaster (Marc Singer)? That says it all right there.The plot's cheesy and has been used before, the acting does not approach Shakespearian, but the fight sequences with Gruner are a joy to watch, and it'll hold your interest. I'd watch it again."
1,W O W...,"I really don't know what to say... I have never, ever, in my life, seen a worse movie than this. Seriously, I'm watching it now... It's almost over, and my mouth is just hanging open due to the utter crappiness of this movie. It's beyond description. Think of the worse movie you've ever seen. Now imagine that movie was the greatest movie ever written and will ever be written. Even then, you'd have no conception of how horrible this movie is.The acting is wooden. My imitations of bad acting are better than this acting. Every scene is stale. I've seen them all before and laughed at them in the past. As was said, this movie makes Van Dam movies seem Oscar worthy. The absolute horrific acting and laughable plot are only amplified by the cheesey and overly dramatic soundtrack.That being said... everyone should have to watch this movie. Just to give you a view of the bottom of film making. This will replace your ""*insert insanely better film (any film)* was the worse movie I've ever seen."""
4,Replaying old games,"Railroad Tycoon 2 Platinum Edition is a game I sent to Goodwill years ago because it wouldn't run on Vista. I heard it would run on Win 7 in (Windows 98/Windows ME) compatibility mode. I ordered a used copy at Amazon and it ran great, I still enjoy playing it. This copy will stay in my collection forever."
4,Railroad Tycoon 2 Platinum Edition,"My 11-year old son loves this game, which he bought last week for 1/2 of the recommended price. This game will work with Windows XP Home Edition but may have to be run in Windows Compatibility Mode."
3,Not enough money,"This game is very fun, but you never get enough money. And it is SO boring while you wait for your funds to accumulate!"
1,Opinions Applenty,"Brother Kent's intentions are I am sure pure in motive but this book still boils down to nothing more than his opinion. Scripture is pulled out of context and used as a backing for his presupositions and his social agenda against the evil ""CCM"" becomes clear as the book moves on. His foundations are mostly accurate the problem is however in the assumptions he leaps into from that Biblical basis. This book is good if you are looking for an ultra-conservative pastor's OPINION on music. If you are looking for clarity on music issues than I'm affraid you will have to look elsewhere."
5,"Shure PG14/PG30 Wireless Headset System, M7","I love it, it does the job perfectly for me. I would recommend this product to anyone. A great gift."
2,PROS AND CONS,The length of the cord was great but the hose did not hold up under pressure. The hose held up well for about 2 minutes until I stopped the water flow at the shower head and not the faucet. This made the hose split under the pressure. I notified the supplier who was kind enough to relace it with another. Insanity is defined as doing the same thing but expecting different results. Yes the new hose split again on the first try. I went and bought a metal reinforced cord which works wonderfully.
5,convenience,"It's very good for me, since I have RA and need to sit in a chair. It is long enough for all my needs."
5,This figure is beautiful!,This is very good figure as she has great sculpting and a incredible likeness as its pretty movie accurate. I recommend Marvel Movie/Marvel Legends/Spider-Man figures for age 10 and up due to the fragileness nature of the figures. Bottom line this is a must have figure if you are a big Fantastic Four fan! I stronlgy recommend this figure!
5,Fantastic product!,I had used this product previously and absolutely loved it. I was excited when I found it here for a great price. It shipped quickly and was as great as I remember it being.
4,Must Read for Bockoven Fans.,"Another treat for all Georgia Bockoven fans ... good recipe possibilities, too! I found some paragraphs a bit verbose and clumsily written; but those were rare and did not impede my enjoyment. Once I started on Friday night I couldn't put it down until late Saturday afternoon."
3,Just Okay,I wish I'd found it as compelling as the previous reviewers...all those 5 star ratings were misleading. This story would make a decent Hallmark movie but nothing more.
3,Things Remembered,"Three sisters are raised by the grandmother after their parents die. Years later Karla returns home to help settle her grandmother's affairs as she is dying. But there are problems not only with her grandmother but with her sister. This is a story of forgiving and forgetting the past and the imporatnace of family.If you enjoy sappy Lifetime or Hallmark movies, then this is the story for you. Beautifully written; but easily forgettable. The characters are okay, but sometimes irritating and one-dimensional. A good book to cuddle up to on a cold winter's evening."
3,Slow start...,"This book started out extremely slow for me. It was extremely repetitive and overly sappy. Anna and Karla appeared to have the same, heavy conversation every other paragraph. I didn't particularly care for Karla, I thought she was such a pushover concerning her sister Grace.By the way, I wanted to punch that girl in the face. And no, I don't think she redeemed herself in the end.Honestly, I would have been much more interested in reading Bill and Heather's story. They seemed like a loving couple and their story interested me. Karla's did not.Towards the end, I did warm up to the story. I liked Karla and Mark together, though I find it unrealistic that they loved each other immediately.Overall, it was too sappy for me....which is unusual because I can usually handle sap like a boss. In fact, I love sap. But even this was just too much.*This book was provided for review on Confessions of a Bookaholic. All thoughts and opinions are my own."
4,Very mood setting,"I cannot attest to the longevity of the bulbs, but I am using them in 2 recessed light fixtures that aim towards our family room's huge river rock fireplace. These lights are hard to change colors on in recessed lighting, but once set, there you go.The lights are extremely cool in setting the mood in this particular room.I am hoping they last a while!"
4,ESTE LIBRO TIENE UNAS VIRTUDES,ENSEÑA A NUESTROS ADOLESCENTES QUE LOS AFRODISIACOS QUIMICOS NI FUNCIONAN Y SI SON MORTALES CON DEMASIADA FRECUENCIA.A los adultos nos demuestra que UNAS GOTAS DE AMOR DADAS CON LA SABIDURÍA MÁXIMA ( LA DE ESTE LIBRO ) SON EL MEJOR AFRODISIACO...
2,"Optically works, but falls off to easily","Optically, this add-on lens works as advertised and corrects properly for my nearsightedness, for which the D200 built-in adjustment is not strong enough. However, I bought - and lost - two of these. They come off much too easily by simply brushing against the walls in the bag when storing the camera. Last time, I had a $20 Hoodman hoodeye connected (which snaps very securely onto this eyepiece) and must have brushed both off while walking with the camera. I don't understand why Nikon can't design this to snap into place, very much like the hoodeye does when used alone. More importantly, if Nikon were to design their cameras to provide adequate diopter adjustment for a wider range, we wouldn't need these little pieces of poor design."
4,A Giant Heart,"The personal story of Sandy Allen is an easy to read and amazingly touching tale of a woman who accepted her situation in life so bravely.It's a fitting memorial to her gentleness and generosity to others, and her story will stay with me forever."
5,It is a great treasure!!!,"It was wonderful to finally be able to own the Biography of The Revd Norman Vincent Peale on a DVD. the quality was excellent - the only amusing slip up was the blurb on the DVD case's back cover which spoke of an outlaw who killed a banker in the Old West and then became a Marshal, LOL obviously NOT Norman Vincent Peale!!!!"
2,Silly and Dull and Embarrassing!,"This is Hollywood's distorted version of the life of the great Norman Vincent Peale, one of my favorite authors. I've read Dr. Peale's biography, so I know the correct story of his life and this definitely isn't it! How he must have cringed when this ridiculous movie came out--and everyone who knew him must have been embarrassed for him. In this film, either the facts are completely wrong, or they're twisted, overdramatized, or left out completely. The actors look nothing like their real-life counterparts and seem to be dragging their way through the terrible dialogue, scene by boring scene. Ignore this film and instead watch ""Biography: Norman Vincent Peale"" by A&E, narrated by Peter Graves, or the PBS version ""Positive Thinking: The Norman Vincent Peale Story."" Both are well-researched and engrossing and accurate!"
2,Novice owners look elsewhere,"This book was written by a fairly knowledgeable dog person who has never pwned a Canaan Dog. You get about what you'd expect from that combo: basically okay but repeating inaccuracies and missing nuances she had no frame of reference to assess. Some errors are important only to breed afficianados, but others are more general: microchips are the size of a grain of rice, not a kernal of corn (ouch!). Not all tapeworms are carried by fleas. There are no microfilaria (heartworm larvae) visible in the illustration on page 119... The book does contain much good information but unfortunately the novice is going to have a difficult time sorting the wheat from the chaff. The photos are lovely but I agree with other reviewers' comments that it would be nice to have included more dogs, especially showing all color patterns and correct color patterns."
3,A bit small for my taste.,"This is one of the more decent bags out on Amazon. Unfortunately it is a little small for my taste. And the shoulder strap can stand to be a bit longer. Luckily I had an extra velcro strap that worked with this bag, so, all in all, pretty decent."
2,Not worth the money!,"I was VERY disappointed in this book! First off, when I first saw the envelope it came in, I couldn't figure out how there could possibly even be a book in it. Well, there was, if you could call it that. It was about 80 pages long and took me less than an hour to read it. I expected a lot more granular information about the audit process, more in-depth definitions of the terminology used in casinos, and overall, MORE information. Pretty much all it consists of is the same generic audit memorandum after each section. I'm really upset that I paid over eighty dollars, about sixty five for the book, and the remainder in shipping. I'm going to see what I can do to get my money back.DON'T waste your money on this book!"
2,The Pictures Were the Best Part,"I got this book because I really like Heath Ledger. The sad thing is that this is just another one of those teen-idols books. It does give a lot of good information and has great pictures, but it could have been better. If you like Heath, I think you should buy it, but you can only take the quiz in the back so many times. I would recommend since you can take it places where you can't watch 10 Things I Hate About You or A Night's Tale. This is a good book, but the pictures really were the best part."
1,Terrible movie,"The acting in this is simply horrendous, I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it. The writing is unoriginal, and the film is trying too hard to establish meaning without developing characters or providing motivations."
2,Not Much To Recommend Here....,"I guess it didn't help when the movie stopped playing after just a few minutes, but this was not the first time Amazon's streaming did not work properly. When I finally was able to return watching it, I found it pretty boring and decided not to waste any more of my time."
2,Dissapointing.,I know he is John Sayles. I have nothing but repect for the man. But this was better read than seen as a movie.
2,Chapter 18!,"Don't get me wrong: over 50 percent of this book is a great read. But beware Chapter 18. After Chapter 18 this book fails every test of literary competency and narrative continuity. It was either at this point that Mr. Bahr's widow began her ill conceived attempt to finish her husband's work or that Mr. Bahr suffered the unfortunate head injury that led to his regrettable heart attack. You think this review is in bad taste? So was the idea of letting this book out for public consumption. Thanks for nothing, Simon and Schuster!"
2,YOU HAVE TO READ THIS...DONT BE FOOLED,"WHEN BYING THE BOOK IT MAY LOOK WONDERFULL BECAUSE OF ITS COVER AND PICTURES BUT DONT BE FOOLED THE CONTENT IS MOSTLY HOGWASH AND THE ONLY THING WORTH READING IN THIS BOOK ARE THE SUB TITLES.THE PICTURES ARE NICE,EVEN SO,THE CONTENT IS NOT SUFFECIENT.THE ERRORS ARE ATROTIOS AND MORE OF HER LIFE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE BUT MY GOD,A WHOLE CHAPTER ON A NOTE SHE WROTE AND THE STORY BEHIND THE LEETTER TO A TEACHER.A PARAGRAPH ABOUT HER LIFE I WAS NOT HAPPY,OFF CORCE,I' EXAGERATING ABOUT THE PARAGRAPH ON HER LIFE,BUT PLEASE..THIS GUY CAN'T WRITE A BIOGRAFY...IT SHUOLD BE TITLED...THINGS THAT DONT REALLY MATTER ABOUT ALANIS AND NO BIOGRAPHY.DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND RATHER SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A MORE IMFORMATIVE BOOK.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR ALANIS FANS. NEEDLES TO SAY,ALANIS DESERVES MUTCH MORE THAN THIS"
2,Another Quick Study,Essentially that title sums it up. The problem with most of these kinds of books is they cover every facet of the performer's life but they are too close in time and too enthusiastic to be definitive on the career of someone who is clearly talented and articulate but has a long way to go to develop to the level of those whom we will remember a hundred years on. This is a source on a life in progress not anywhere near a final word and analysis.This review will serve as well for the second edition when it is listed here.
3,NOT as great,"Paul cantin's books on alanis are so much better this one is not. its hard to say that an alanis book isn good knowing how big a fan i am and all but if you are a alanis collecter you should get the book, but if your new onm alanis this isnt the greatest source for info"
2,the review of IRONIC,"Normally, I wouldn't give any book on alanis a bad review, but i JUST couldn't help myself. I think that this book wasn't really about alanis. It had a lot of facts that weren,t 100% accurate. (I think he got these on the internet) It talked about lots of boring facts in it and I couldn't bring myself to read past the first few chapters! Sorry, barry grills, I think your book isn't very interestiong, intreguing or informative. Even so, I collect Alanis stuff and this book is a necessity for my collection. Thanks for reading, E.J. :)"
1,two fat thumbs down,"Yuck!!! I was robbed when I bought this book. Almost no info on Alanis, it just dragged on and on. Definately leave it on the shelve."
1,not good,"I stopped in the middle because it got so damn boreing. All the author talked about was Jim Morrison. The contence of the book was pretty lame. I would say the best part of the book was the picture on the cover. ( If you were thinking about buying this book, I wouldn't recomend it! ) , And why I gave it a =2, is because I gave an effort score."
4,Get the Japanese Imports!,"Both of these albums are among my favorite all time Thrash masterpieces, however, as a collector I feel obligated to let would be buyers know that on track 3 of Mind Wars on this set, on the song ""The Immortal Wasteland"", there is a defect... a digital POP / SKIP in the song that is quite noticable. It is clearly an issue on the master itself, as the CD I had was brand new and scratch free. You would be better off tracking down the japanese import or the original 1988 RC disc of MIND WARS if you want to hear the album completely defect free. I know for some it will not be a big deal, and without this obvious defect, I would have rated this set a 5, however, if Powerage, the now defunct label who released this 2 CD set had taken better care to inspect the master before it went to press, the MIND WARS disc would have been flawless."
5,Holy Terror Rocks!,I've tried for 6 years to find this music on the file sharing sites and you can't find it anywhere. I gladly bought these albums because it was some stuff I really enjoyed back in the late 80's. This is some really great fast paced metal! I love it!
1,DON'T BUY THE BLACKEND REISSUE OF THIS CD!!!,DON'T BUY THE BLACKEND REISSUE!!!THIS CD SET IS DEFECTIVE!!YOU WILL BE AS DISAPPOINTED AS I AM IF YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE! BLACKEND IS A DEAD-END! NO LIE!FIND THE ORIGINAL PRESSINGS ON R/C RECORDS.
4,"A must, but ...","Sun Tzu's ""Art of war"" is a must to any reader who has any interest whatsoever in the ways of battle. BUT, to the reader who has read nothing before concerning war - it is a great revelation. To the one who has read and studied the modern rules and principles of battle the book is only an authorization to what you already know. the true wonder of the book is that this authorization was not given after a few field tests in some battle ground in europe - but more then 2000 years back.The one who reads ""the art of war"" must not come to reading it out of the blue - or it will be nothing more then a bunch of nice ideas. But if you have some background in the subject you will find it fascinating."
1,"Poor translation, without the cross referenced goodies.","Horrible translation that fails to maintain tenses within paragraphs, spelling errors, etc. Don't be fooled by this inexpensive alternative to the cross referenced translations available."
4,Good Concepts!,I am not a big war person or understand the in's and out of all that strategy and alliance stuff..but the principals are solid in this book. I kinda gleaned the book more than anything for the concepts. There are a lot of great words of wisdom that I truly am benefitting from and I am very happy with the book.
4,Very good book,"I like the clear language of the actual book. Although it is short, I recommend it be read various times."
3,know your history,"the chinese have been basically lost every war they fought due to individual chinese selfishness (i.e. accepting bribes, misusing funds). i find it humorous that so many people actually buy this book, i guess they think it looks good on the library or in the office. whatever, read a history book instead."
1,maybe great for war,"This book may be great for war, but It is unless for everyday modern life. It took me forever to read. I just couldn't get into it."
1,not worth the time,This book is very slow and tedious. I was very disappointed with it after hearing so much about the great Sun Tzu. Don't bother with it.
5,College gold mine,I been in college for 3 years now and have avoided reading the art of war for some time now. now thought that i am moveing to my policitial studies major i am finding that all the tatics and theroies that Sun Tzu propesed have even more relaiance than it did 2000 years ago. Makes you think if Clition can read or not when it comes to forgien policy. In short Tzu states violiance is the last step to any conflict first anf formost you should use spies and inteliance. THe application of force by the us is frightening and can be counter production mabe all those west point and navel ad. should open this book and learn from a master just my two cents
2,Introductory material is not so introductory,"At the outset, let me say that Sun Tzu gets 5 stars. Having withstood at least two millennia, his thirteen chapters of warlike proverbs are beyond any reproach I can provide.I'm giving two stars to this book's introductory material. If I was more familiar with Chinese history, then perhaps I would have appreciated the introductory material more. Unfortunately, the introduction's academic pitch was oftentimes beyond my reach. I picked this book up hoping to read a great Chinese work placed accessibly within historical context. In the end, I can say that I have read Sun Tzu, but I still can't put him into context."
3,Good Book but not truly applicable,"I enjoyed the book. It was easy to read, but i found it difficult to project it to real life situations. One reviewer says that this book can be as helpful in the football field as in a romantic relationship! I think book is really about offensive military starategy. You cannot really use this book in business; especially not in business negotiations where the most fruitful attitude is win/win (Mutual benefit), if I win and you lose then you'll never do business with me again. This book in entirely about offensive warfare; not fully applicatable to today's business culture (although some parts are)."
4,Now how is this book going to help me in the 21st century?,"My review title says it all. Yeah it's a good and even famous book. But how does this book apply to our current age? Should we pick a nice open field when meeting tough customers just to gain advantage on the terrain?This book should be read without judgement. Just breathe in all wisdom the ancient Sun Tzu has given us. Don't expect instant knowledge, but read this book over and over again and you will get the clue.Sun Tzu's writings hold a vast knowledge on tactics that still apply today, although we throw e-mails to each other instead of spears. You'll learn to recognize his tactics within your own situation. Use them how you seem fit. I even applied it on strategy games and it seemed to me I had an advantage with his knowledge. Even in business we can still 'pick the ground' although it could be a good restaurant instead of hills.Does this book apply to the 21st century? Definitly!"
1,retarded,"dont get drunk and think you're buying the art of war like i did. this is some moron giving his intepretation of the art of war, and it sucks."
2,"exotic, obsolete, and advice for doing business??","Americans have always shown a blind tendency to think the Chinese culture is wise and misterious. No wonder such book found its way onto the market--even its title implis a sense of wisdom and mistery. With such ""wisdom"" of war, the Chinese failed to win a single war against almost any intruder over the past 2000 years. Indeed they won some battles once in a while, but even with overwhelming population and productivity, the Chinese had been defeated and often ruled by Mongolians, Manchurians, British, and Japanese, to name just a few. Moreover, business today is more about creativity than undermining the competitiveness of rivals through cheating, conspiracy, and extortion. This book sure has historical value but I wonder if those who claim that it's full of valuable advice for the war and business today are sincere."
1,This book is not SUN TZU you are warn not SUN TZU,"I purchase believing the reviews what i read, it not sun tzu has nothing of the original book SUN TZU the art of war so YOU ARE WARN! if you want to spend your time & money go ahead but you are warn this isnt any close to SUN TZU the art of war"
1,zzzzz,"Man, after all the kudos my old, dumb crowd from high school had foisted on this book, to finally read it and see what they were crowing about...turned out to be nothing but namedrop, I guess, because its a bore and a half. This edition is 200 pages long, however, the actual text is onnly about 90. But it doesn't matter if you skip the prefaces and appendices, you'll still be reading very dry, dated, technical military tactics. Do not, do not buy this if you are expecting philosophy, martial arts wisdom, or business strategy. They just say that so you'll buy it. One thing was revealing; Sun Tzu's accomplishments and history, like Socrates and Jesus, may be apocryphal, merely an authority figure to refer to who had undeniable wisdom."
3,Art of war falls short of expectations,"The Art of War is a timeless classic written by a Chinese expert on war. Its principles can be applied to a wide variety of subjects and can be interpreted in a vast array of contexts. However, as musc as the book is praised and ""hyped"" it really fell short of my expectations. It is not a ""Bible"" of life, ie. rules to live by for success, but rather a collection of Chinese proverbs that are loosely organized and somewhat difficult to relate to at times. Moreover, most editions have prefaces and other ""additions"" by the person who translated the text, so in reality Sun Su's work was about 70 pages in my edition. I would not recommend buying the book, rent it at the local library instead and save it for a rainy day. For a great motivational book, I would recommend The Fountainhead by Aynn Rand."
4,i wanted this book,"Usually most placid and submissive, this person pushed me too far. i am planning a war on a former friend who betrayed me in the worst ever possible way.She nearly destroyed me. This book showed me how to do it without death happening. No blood shead."
4,read first bevin alexander`s books first;then this book,"i am not commenting on this book. i have one from 1982 by Graham brash published in Singapore. When i first read art of war, it went over my head.but after reading bevin alexander`s books ieSun Tzu at Gettysburg: Ancient Military Wisdom in the Modern World,Inside the Nazi War Machine: How Three Generals Unleashed Hitler's Blitzkrieg Upon the World,etc, i found reading art of war more relevant & practical.also i applied it to video games espOperation Flashpoint Red River Ps3& it`s a great way to test out tactics in urban warfare.so my suggestion is to please read bevin`s books first & then the art of war. will really help solidify understanding."
4,For Statesmen and Military Commanders,"This edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War is noteworthy for several reasons. The book was translated and edited by U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Samuel B. Griffith, who served in China and fought the Japanese in the Pacific during World War II. General Griffith provides useful annotations, while pointing out inconsistencies and uncertainties in the text. For this edition, he wrote sections on the influence of Sun Tzu on the Japanese and Chairman Mao Tse-Tung. As a bonus, this edition includes a later (and shorter) Art of War written by Wu Chi."
3,Simplicity,"Its depth is found in its simplicity. But I can't say that I found it life changing. The famous quote about ""knowing your enemy"" was the best bit. Would have been much better without the translator's constant interpolation of footnotes. Easily two-thirds of the book was the editor talking vs. Sun Tzu."
5,A book for all eternity,"This book is one of the ""eternities"" that Emerson implored us to study.The references to old wars and warriors may not be familiar but the message is apparent to anyone who can pay attention.If you are familiar with the Gordon Gekko character from the movie _Wall street_ you'll recognize the nuggets culled from this timeless book.Not only is this versatile book a psychological manual for the purposes of conducting warfare,it is also handy for the aspiring entrepreneur with a Machiavellian bent.Truly one of the All-Time greats."
4,An Ancient Text That's Still Applicable Today.,"When you hold this book in your hands and read it, it's hard to believe that it was written such a long, long time ago. It easily could have been written in the present time if not for all the references to ancient wars and, warriors. The thing that is even more amazing is that, most of the strategies still are applicable today. Weather in personal life, corprate life or, on the battle field, the writings of Sun Tzu ring true and, hold you on course.A most enjoyable worthwhile read."
4,Great Strategy Book!!,Indeed this is one of my best collection of books I ever have. It reveal thetrue meaning of war and teaches you the methods to defeat your enemy.My best collection after Sun Tzu's book.
5,Art of War,I'm half through it already The preface and introduction provide insight into the history of the author and his counterparts. This book is well wrtitten and illustrated and is a great guide to the work of Sun Tzu
4,An excellent book,"Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" is a great book. I have found it to be very helpful. I have applied some of the principles to sports, and it has helped very much. The principles that Sun Tzu discusses are mostly very simple. The ideas behind it though, if applied properly, could help anyone to achieve their goal. The principles can be applied to any field imaginable. The book was written in China around 500 B.C. This still does not mean that it is out dated, far from it. The principles in fighting a war still remain very similar. Sun Tzu is a military genius. His comprehension of what it takes to win a war will probably never be matched. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in being a leader. This is not just for military leaders either, but for someone who wants to be a leader anywhere. This is a must read for anyone."
3,My thoughts on the Art of War,"The Art Of War has been really interesting, because it makes you think and try to understand the book because of the terms the author uses in it. I felt that the book has a little too much of fighting tactics, it should have been added with action and drama, rather then having the energy of a textbook.This book is amazing because of how long the records lasted of it being written at about 400 ad, and ascribed onto bamboo. Then lasting to the paper era and being abridged onto that.I feel that this book would help a General in an army, or someone that would like to learn on ancient chinese tactics, and how it work's on the enemy."
5,The Abyss,"This was an incredibly fascinating piece of literature that has weathered wonderfully though the eons. The Falcon has heard the Falconer, trust me on this one. When dealing with adversaries, one must remember when looking long into the abyss, the abyss looks long into you."
5,Organizational tactics for any event or confrontation,This classic work contains some indespensible truths about how to adjust and succeed in any situation. It teaches humility in times of great strength and confidence in times of weakness. A book that must be read by anyone claiming to be a leader or who wishes to master his or her own life.
3,Buy this only if you like to read headings.... without commentary,"I bought this book for my wife, but she did not like it because it does not have commentary or explanation. It is as if you are reading only the headline, you may not know in detail."
2,Kindle Version - Poorly Formatted from a Free Source,"The Kindle version of this book is from Project Gutenberg -- a website that makes books that are out of copyright available for free. Unfortunately, whoever created the book did a poor job of formatting it and it has random line-breaks scattered throughout the book. It's probably better to get the book directly from Project Gutenberg."
4,I would like to have read the actual words translated,"I agree with the others who have commented that they would have liked to have read the actual translation, rather than the constant editorializing by the author. Certainly, his comments were insightful, but I would have rather have heard them in a separately noted section, or with different type or SOMEthing.Still, I was able to get the point of the matter, and I can see how marketing folks use exactly this to win all sorts of 'wars' on their target market, etc.And while this information is informative enough, I took a defense manual from it also. It seems that there is way too much of this as common knowledge. It does help to win in competitive situations, however I see this limited to sports. In this context, for me, it works."
2,Not what I wanted,someone told me to get this book so I checked it out and was nothing like I was told. I wonder if I got the right book.
2,"A tiresome read, but worth it...","This book is not exciting. It is written like a text book. I feel that it would be a good read for anyone that is getting into a competative business because it teaches you how to win. Sun Tzu discusses various strategies that one could use to achieve victory under many different circumstances. Again, only read this book if you are looking to learn something. Don't buy it expecting a casual read, because you will be dissapointed."
3,"I was looking for another ""Prince"".","Althought this book contains many valuable Gems, it is not what I was looking for. I thought it would be similar to ""The Prince"", in its applicability to modern life and business. But it turned out to be a book about ""WAR"", and what's more, a book about ""Ancient Warfare"".I would say that I found 20% of the book to be really valuable, 40% to be interesting and the remaining 40% to be an utter waste of time.I recommend you read the Prince by Niccolo Machiaveli."
2,What the?,"I bought this for two reasons, suggested reading book from my school and airsoft. So, it gave me the excuse to buy the book. Only about 50 pages of the book is about what Sun Tsu said. The first 60 pages were filled with intros and biographies. The rest of the book is filled with mostly other peoples opinions and other people's ""Art of War"". I would not recommend this book."
2,Works every now and then,"When this unit is installed, often the PC won't boot in the morning. I can remove the thing and the problem goes away. Mechanically, it's not well designed. The only thing that holds the front pieces of the housing apart is the drive, when inserted. If you remove the drive drawer, the pieces move towards the center quite a bit. I've had a couple of other removable drive units like this for IDE drives and never had a moments problem with them. Surely there are better quality units that work well."
1,size,It would be nice if there were some information of size and/or dimension so I can determine if it would fit the child..
3,NOT TO MY TASTE,"This perfume received excellent reviews on Fragrantica.com and is a favorite of one of my ""perfumista"" friends. However, on me it smells almost muddy initially, and the dry-down is no better.After wearing it twice, I gave it away."
3,Seems different,"This Bandit perfume certainly seems different to me now--I don't know whether it is because I haven't worn it for many years and my memory of it is otherwise or because this one was bottled in the US and may just not be the same as when it is bottled in France. So though I was hoping to love it, or re-love, I would choose another of my favorites..like 1000 or Oscar de la Renta, before I would buy this again. This is too bad because I was really back and forth about my decision to spend this much money on a perfume I hadn't been familiar with for many years--mistake."
2,CERAMIC HEATER ONLY LASTED 2 DAYS,ITEM PURCHASED TO HEAT A WORK SPACE OF 600 SQFT.WAS TO BE THE SECOND HEATER IN ROOM. STARTED FINE BUT AFTER 2 DAYS BEGAN TO SHUT ITSELF OFF FOR PERIODS OF TIME(30-60MIN) FINALLY WOULDN'T WORK AT ALL.RETURNED TO AMAZON.
1,Going back......again!,This heater has a serious design flaw with the thermostat.After the initial warm-up the heater cuts off and on at very short intervals (seconds) with the thermostat turned all the way up. I took the 1st one back thinking it was an individual problem. Now I've got to take this one back. I wish it worked like it looks!
1,do not buy!!!,I have the same prob as stated from other people. it keeps shutting off and will not stay on.
1,Too Bad,"Nice looking heater, just doesn't work.The most warmth you will get out of this heater is what you generate carrying it to the dump.Do not buy!"
4,Videos? Hm... ok,"I tend to agree that they want to milk every last cent out of us. However, being such a huge fan I would probably buy a DVD of Dave burping the ABCs. Normally this is where I would have said, ""WHY NOT A LIVE CONCERT??"" However, the band has redeemed themselves by offering the 12-19-1998 show in Chicago on DVD. This is due out October 23. This show is simply amazing... the opener of Last Stop gives me chills! Add Vic Wooten, Maceo Parker and Tim Reynolds to the mix and you've got perfection. I've had this show on MPG for about a year and I promise you are going to be blown away."
3,Expected much more.,I expected much more of this DVD. It is only a compilation of the Videos. Not enouth extras.
3,"C'mon Dave, You're rich enough!","3 stars- just bring down the average. First, no one you has seen this yet. Second, do you realize how much video one can cram onto a dvd- Dave could give us the 12 videos, the short films, and a concert or two. Third, is there really a demand for this? I think everyone would rather a live show than some videos I could see on VH1 tonight. This happened on the Tool -Salival DVD- Sure, the Tool videos are the best around, but that (and this) dvd could be put together in an afternoon. Don't waste my money, Dave!"
4,Good addition to DMB Collection,"This DVD collection of the band's videos is not all that could be hoped for, but certainly not awful either. The quality of the presentations are first rate. The sound is wonderful and the visuals are crisp and clear. The audio commentaries are brief, but mostly interesting. The ""making of"" short videos were disappointing to me as they didn't really show too much about the concepts and the production, but more-so just a few behind the scenes type moments. Overall, however, if you are a DMB fan this is a good, solid addition to your collection. It is a good way to whet your appetite for this October's release of the December 19th, 1998 show from Chicago."
5,Awesome...,"This CD is great. These guys have the best beats, really original. I would recommend it..."
4,I've seen better,"The real bonus in this DVD is to see 2 playmate of the year in the same DVD, and to see Heather Kozar with long hair is so different to the 2000 edition. Julia Schults stands out for me, along with Deanna Brooks and Layla Roberts, but apart from that, it only average throughout. check out the 2000 Edition, it's longer and better."
5,Great DVD,My daughter is completely in love with it. It is a great DVD. Wish there were more of the same series.
4,Ethics for a Brave New World,"This volume by the Feinbergs, is a fair and even handed treatment of several very important and contreversial topics. As a pastor of a rural church in northcentral Kansas, I am limited in my ability to do in depth theological research. This volume is a wealth of information to inform and enlighten ones understanding on the ethical issues facing our current day. I have read and used it often."
2,life is too short to read bad books,"If you find yourself reading a poorly written book (like this one), find something else to read. If the ideas are good, then someone else said it some place else.... and the odds are that they said it better.And I didn't find much of their argumentation particularly persuasive either. They got two stars, since there is a quite a bit of information in the book. They get that extra star for effort."
2,an academic work,It's not a book for everybody. It's an academic translation. The editor doesn't make any effort to make the book interesting. It's a partial translation. The best parts of the work haven't been translated. I would have liked much more notes and explications. Chinese classics deserve a better handling and treatment.
2,itchy bra,"This bra would probably be great for a smaller woman, but it didn't work for me. The cups offer very limited support, and the back material caused me to suffer irritation and itching."
1,"Bras difficult to buy on line,",This looked so sturdy but when I received it the support straps are so tiny and light they are no support at all. Entire bra very flimsy and not size true either.
3,A Hollywood variation of sex-addict story,"When most people think of addictions, sex in not the first thing that comes to mind. Nevertheless, sex addiction is a problem for a substantial number of people. ""Ultimate Taboo"" explores this topic from the Hollywood perspective. While such approach is not necessarily representative of every addict's life, it certainly gives the viewer an idea of how destructive the consequences of such ""glamorous"" lifestyle may be."
5,Learning to Worship With All Your Heart,"This is a great introduction to the biblical foundations to Christian worship. The weekly matieral is easy to read and the follow-up questions help one to think about their approach to worship. If you are looking for ways to turn your worship ""vertical"", this is a great study guide for personal or corporate worship."
4,Excellent Basic Coverage of KDE,"Just the right book at the right time. Takes some of the mystery out of KDE's layout and utilities. I learned a lot, and use it as my KDE reference. Recommended!!"
4,Dr. Doom,"My 5 year old son has wanted this figure of Dr. Doom to complete his Fantastic 4 set, we just couldn't find it anywhere in the stores. Thanks to Amazon.com he now has his complete set and battles good versus evil in his room for hours! It is a great realistic figure."
3,Doomsday!,"The character of Dr. Doom was not in the movie for long.However,they wouldnt have made a toy of Victor von Doom.This figure is the only Dr.Doom figure I own,so I wont be harsh.This figure has 21 points of articulation(just like the 12"" Doc Ock).That is fine for a figure of its size.I love the paint job on the figure(movie accurate).Two things bother me though,1.Is the hood.Very big on the figure.NOT COOL! 2.is the difference between the prototype and the actual figure.real figure is a darker green.Plus, you might have already heard,the packaging stinks(causes paint damage). Still great toy!"
5,Exactly what we needed,"Perfect match, good quality and price plus I didn't have to go in search of it in a brick and mortar store. What else can you say about a filter? We did look at our trusted local hardware store but they didn't stock the correct Lennox filter so we bought one that was close... well, 1/2 inch difference matters a lot on this type of product so be careful.From now on, we'll look here first !"
4,Fun!,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography is classic B movie, but better. Over all it looks pretty good. Lots of fantastic one liners. Some of the action gets a little redundant, but you really can't go wrong with a bunch of hot vampire chicks with chainsaws.Despite what you may infer from a B movie titled Vampire Chicks with Chainsaws, there is no nudity or sex which I consider a plus.Look else where for the Oscar winning picture of the year, or buy this for the love of original and fun movies!"
2,"Great service, hey everyone begins somewhere","I knew the movie was low budget and so did not expect much. My daughters school teacher was in the movie and wanted to see her in it. Hey, every actor/actress starts somewhere. My daughter just wanted to see her teacher in action and yes I only let her see the parts I felt appropriate."
2,Great diagrams but poorly presented,"As mentioned in other reviews, the diagrams are great, but overall I feel that the book is not well presented. A better way to present the book would be to have more pages, with less diagrams on each page, and the labelling being on each diagram.Found it distracting to look at the diagrams -- find the number on the diagram, and then to try to find the correct number on the other page -- that tells you the name of the various physical systems.I would have been willing to pay more, if the book would have been presented better."
5,Great Purchase,"Nothing to say but GREAT!!! Great price, great image quality, very nice line. Buy it now!!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"My least favorite Melissa Scott effort, it was not holding my attention much at all."
4,NOT FOR 4 YEAR OLDS!,"I purchased this book for a child's 4th birthday. I was going by the age estimate provided in the item description, which says Ages 4-8. Well, the book is actually for Grades 1-3, which obviously does not include 4 year olds. The content is appropriate, but there are not many 4 year olds who will be able to read any of this book on their own. So if you want a book that your young child can start reading on their own, look elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,I keep trying different RainX products because their window treatment is so fantastic. I should have learned by now though that the ONLY product that they make that is great is the window treatment. I was disappointed in their Bug & Tar Pre-Wash gel. It just doesn't work (very well). Spent $6 for the bottle and used the entire content before driving my car through a car wash. Feel like I could have thrown the $6 out my car window and had the same effect.
2,Not that great,"Bought this product after a road trip when I had plenty of bugs and tar on my vehicle. I followed the instructions word for word. To be honest, it didn't work that great. You can get the same results with just a little extra elbow grease. This product will also kill all the suds in your soap bucket, so make sure it has been completely rinsed off your car before you follow up with your wash mitt. The best way to get bugs off is to soak a cotton towel in hot water and drape it on the bug caked portion of your car. Bugs are water soluble, 10 minutes of this and they will spray right off without any chemicals. This product is not worth your hard earned money."
5,Great Product Better Price At Walmart,This stuff works great its amazing it is the best thing on the marjet but you can usually pick it up from walmart for about $3.27 a bottle but right now no walmart with in like 50 miles of where i live has it because its bug season!!
5,The Sirens call you to Fez,"If you've never been to Fez, you'll feel like you have after reading Ruth Knafo Setton's 'The Road to Fez'... She creates and successfully sustains an abstract atmosphere of tension and mystique throughout the story, all the while her descriptions of the land and its characters are so vivid and concrete they are almost tangible. The colors and the smells of a land and time so removed from ours, stick with you long after the last page is turned. Very shortly after starting her story, you'll become familiar with a way of life described so intimately, you are startled to remember that Brit, the main character, is actually not wholly of this magical place. Even Brit has to pull back from her daily experience to remember she has options to return to her former life in the US. The land and people are so real and intense that you, as a reader, will become part of it as well. If you hear the Sirens calling you to read this book, listen to them.!"
5,I love this book!,"This book reads the way a dream unfolds: inevitable and urgent, tale within tale, word by word. Setton is a true discovery! She transported me to a Mediterranean world of sun, shadow, brilliance, a world I've never encountered in American literature before, but one I hope I'll encounter again. The last time I remember feeling like this was after reading the Arabian Nights! I love this book for many reasons but primarily because Setton doesn't write about desire as if it's a dirty word, or something to be avoided. In this book, people long for God, a home and a lover with equal intensity. It's one of these perfect short novels, with not a single unnecessary word. When I got near the end, I kept turning back and rereading because I didn't want to leave the magical world of The Road to Fez. Today it is wintry cold outside but I still feel the power, wisdom and beauty of the characters of this book warming me."
1,Absolute junk,"This could be a very good product if they improve the quality. After the 1st week, The taillight clip broke off and I had to make a Velcro strap to mount it on the back of my seat. After 6 months of use, both the headlight and taillight cuts out intermittently. I almost got hit when the taillight went out. That's when I decided to throw this thing away and put my old faithful vintage generator set back on that was purchased in the 70s."
3,"Great when it works, but only for one day!","After installation, it was great! both rear and front lights. but after only one ride, the front stops working!!I tried to contact the company but no reply. So, I opened the unit and did some simple wiring to disable the IC and make it only switch on or off, no blinking. The rear is still working...."
1,No delivery,Never recieved delivery of product from EDISCOUNTBIKESpoor customer service from supplierwould not recommend purchasing products from supplier EDISCOUNTBIKES
1,Should Lights Be This Hard to Set Up ???,"Now that I've gotten through the set-up, sure these lights work perfectly, but should they be so hard to set up? The front light was fine, but the back one... ?! You have to put the batteries in yourself, and in order to get the casing open to get the batteries in you have to remove 3 teeny, tiny screws. Sounds easy, well I have perhaps 10 screwdrivers at home, but none of them were small enough. Even after I borrowed a tinier one from a friend, it was still very awkward to maneuver, with the clip being poorly positioned, etc. I hope these batteries never run out, because it took me days to get them inside in the first place! Very poor design."
4,Good Item,"The item is great! work fine for me, but if you are looking for something really shining in to darkness, you need buy something more advanced"
4,Nice lights,"I bought this for my 10yr old's electric scooter. He wanted to ""customize"" his scooter, so I thought these lights had a very unique look to them. My son loves them. He put them on his scooter himself and is happy with them. I won't let him ride at night, but he sure loves to tell his friends about his new custom scooter and show it off with lights on and all!"
2,Bike Lights,"The front light is very bright and fastens on easily to the handlebars, then the light slides onto a mounting bracket. Every time I get on the bike I am able to knock the light off. It almost landed in the storm drain once. I will be buying another light that is smaller and fastens securely to the mounting bracket. I recommend the rear light however."
2,"Back light great, Front WAY too big.","I love the Mars 3.0 light, it's super bright, light, tough, and easy to clip.But the Quadrant is way to big, heavy, and cumbersome. I ride in NYC and there's no way I'm going to lug this around with me. Perhaps it's good for riding in the middle of nowhere or calling alien ships (because it is bright), but I ended up selling it and getting a small one.I would suggest not getting the combo. Get the Mars for sure, then something likePlanet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mounteven though the mount is a little finicky. It's just a better setup if you are like me and like not to be weighed down, or leave your lights attached."
2,"bulky, heavy, quickly broke","I like and still use the rear light. However the front light broke after 3 or 4 months.I was using it 4 or 5 times a week for city night riding. It would fall off easily if I hit a bump, etc. I think this was due to its large size and weight (it uses 4 AA batteries). Also, it would occassionally turn on in my backpack, unbeknownst to me of course. Eventually, it became difficult to turn on or off and later stopped turning on all together. It didn't seem related to any specific time it fell off my bike.For what it's worth, I did like the mount and the blinking features, and thought it made me very visible to surrounding traffic."
4,Great for Safety,Both lights are very bright and make the rider very visable. I like the flashing component of both. We had a defective tail light in the first shipment so check the product closely upon receipt. The return for replacement went smoothly.
2,Kuotaninja,"This light appears small and its HUGE! I would not get this light if you a serious cyclist. As a cyclist you want less stuff on your and this light is not a good one. Maybe best for mountain biking or easy going cycling, I had to return this light and get the Light & Motion, which is much more expensive and the best light for serious cyclists."
4,good deal,"Both lights are insanely bright. I'm almost afraid to use them. The headlight does an okay job lighting the path ahead, could be better but is adequate. The taillight does an almost better job of lighting the path behind you. Bright!Would (and have) suggest to a friend."
4,Not bad for price,"The brake light is really bright and has full on, on/off pulse, or random led blinking, but the head white led light isn't as bright as I thought it would be."
3,It's ok.,"It works. I have some trouble keeping the front light aiming in the right direction. I tried tightening it more, but maybe my handlebars are a bit thin. The soft material inside the clamp seems engineered very well to protect the finish/paint on my handlebars, but I believe this leads to the softness that allows it to slip on bouncy roads. Easy enough to fix when it knocks down though.I like the different flashing options, and I'm very satisfied with the rear light. Overall a good product."
2,Ok for safety,"Light is ok to use a a safety light to be seen, but does NOT shed much light for good night riding visibility. Taillight is again provides good visibility to cars, but is a little small and mounting bracket is cheaply made."
3,heavy front light; shines in eyes,"The rear light is great, though I do worry about snapping the clip (mentioned in other reviews - its hard unflexible plastic vs flexible plastic or metal for a more solid build). However, I have issues with the front light:1) it's HUGE. and HEAVY. bobs up and down a bit because it doesn't attach super tight.2) the top isn't covered well, and it shines in your eyes at night a bit. not the best design."
5,blackburn light combo,"very good combo, very bright, blinding when pointed at the eyes. one of the betters bike lights out there, highly recommended"
5,"Great product for the price, very bright!","I did an extensive research on amazon and online before purchasing a headlight/tail light combo. I found that out of all good brands out there, this was the best deal! It seemed like a couple years old model but it works really well. The headlight fell of the clip on me the first time I was riding the bike, but I have to admit it was my fault - MAKE SURE WHEN YOU ARE MOUNTING THE HEADLIGHT TO THE LITTLE PLASTIC CLIP, MAKE SURE IT CLICKS IN PLACE AND HELD SECURELY. I did not ush hard enough and it did not click securely. After the fall I made sure I pushed hard enough so that it clicked in place. I bought two of them, one for my girlfriend.Would reccomend to anyone!"
4,"Good light, great price","I've had the light for a month now and really like it. The tail light is very bright and can be seen from the side, which I think is a big advantage. The front light with the flashing sides and steady center allows the best of both worlds - allowing you to see the road and still catch the attention of vehicles. My only critique is that the headlight is rather bulky, compared to many other lights. It is very obvious on the handlebars and hopefully won't get stolen too quickly. It's also clearly not a serious pathlighter, but is fine for town situations where there's usually other light on the road as well."
4,makes you safer,The lights work well. Although the picture shows the red tail light being bigger than the headlight; that isn't the case. I like how they work and the intensity is decent on the headlight. Glad I bought them. Now I can leave for work earlier in the morning. We have recently downsized to one vehicle. I am saving at least 70 miles a week. Here's to good health and environmental awareness.Improvements:*If the manufacturer could make them so the installation was more permanent; instead of being clip-ons. Someone out there will want a couple of free lights.
3,Good starter or occasional use set,"This light set is a good deal for an occasional rider as a starter light set, or for a backup or extra set.The headlight: First thing to realize: It is not designed to illuminate the road while traveling at any significant speed. It is designed for city riding with the purpose of making you visible to other vehicles. The brightness is excellent, but the mount is insecure, the body seems unnecessarily large, and the top of the light shines back in your face (but this can be fixed with a bit of black tape).The taillight: Very well designed overall. Very bright and good side illumination. However, the light should not require a tool to open. The screws on the light are smaller than standard bicycle parts and require a jewelers' screwdriver to remove."
2,"Great at first, but doesn't last","I purchased this set for use on the bike I use for commuting to work every day. At first, I was very impressed by how bright the light was, and very happy with the product.However, after a few months (a couple hundred miles worth of riding on Chicago streets), the lights (first the front, then the rear) would start to go out after I hit a bump in the road. Turning them off and on or jiggling the light a little would turn them back on, but after a little while they'd go off again. Eventually they just didn't work anymore. I tried replacing the batteries to no avail, so I think something just came loose in the light. Unfortunately there is no easy way to open up the light to make a repair.So I've decided that, while these lights probably work fine in nicer conditions, they're just not tough enough for a commuter bike."
2,clumsy and fragile,"the tail light attach system is not strong enough for mountain biking demands, the hook to attach it broke at third ride. the headlight is too big, the light is dim. The reflections of the leds in the clear front end interferes with your vision.... take a look at the design, the clear plastic allows to spill out the light in a more than 180 degrees, and not to the front,i don't recommend buying this light"
4,Best lights bang for the buck,These lights are bright! I ride most days to work and often come home in the dark. I've had one other set of lights that were pretty decent but the Mars set is way brighter. The front lamp is esp nice since you can see it really well from the side too. That way all those right turning cars at red lights don't plow me over.The clip for the rear light is very well made but I do have some problems with the front light clip. It just doesn't slide & click so well. Also the front light is rather heavy so if the bracket for holding it to your handlebar isn't tight it can slip.Overall tho I think its one of the best I've seen and pretty cheap too. Long battery life too.
4,Great,"This light is great, I ride a lot at night and I have received several praises about this light. It is so bright and with the flashing mode you will be seen at night. Also you cant beat the price on Amazon. I saw the exact product at a local store for $35.00"
4,"the best, but still not without flaws","i bought the headlight about a year ago from my local bike shop without the rear light. they charged $38, so this is a really great deal for a really well designed, durable headlight and rear light. very high quality. my only complaint is with the mounting bracket. it is too flimsy and my light kept falling off. to it's credit, it hit pavement doing 20+ mph several times before it finally broke. i'm getting another one because of the price and it is still the toughest light out there. maybe my bracket was flawed, as someone else said theirs held too tightly. that's what i'm looking for!!!!"
2,"Over the top ""psychological"" thriller","Messiah tracks a team of Scotland Yard detectives on the trail of a serial killer in London. Each murder becomes more grotesque and is described in painstaking detail. The team of detectives moves from one crisis to the next, (both personal and professional), especially the lead sleuth. And, as one can guess from the title, there is a religious twist to the plot. I assume all this is meant to build tension for the reader, unfortunately it all becomes somewhat numbing, monotonous and tiresome, i.e. any shock value quickly wears thin due to sheer repetition. The story itself becomes predictable and formulaic and the good guys and bad guy caricatures of themselves. The book is much much too long and the ending anti-climactic. Pass on this one."
3,"Interesting concept, but a bit confused","I originally read Messiah because of the recommendations from other reviews on Amazon that compared it to famous serial killer novels such as ""Silence of the Lambs"". While I certainly enjoyed the novel, I thought it was a bit confused in parts, something that I think Boris Starling can probably blame on this being his first novel. Starling does a good job of attempting to incorporate a great deal of Christian doctrine into the book, which I thought enhanced the storyline. However, the character development was a bit obviously done a la Thomas Harris, and it simply didn't work for me. The nuance wasn't there.Overall, if you are a serial killer novel fan, this is a good read. If you're looking for something with the richness and color of a Thomas Harris, look elsewhere."
4,Terrific first novel by an author that bears watching,"Wow. I wasn't expecting too much going in, so this book was quite a pleasant surprise. Quite horrific in places, while in other places it actually will make you think, this book is well written, with a main character/detective that is refreshingly different from the hordes of single cops with dark secrets and high sex drives that pervade most books of this genre.The best part about this book though, by far, are the murders and the way the city itself reacts. I think that's what I enjoyed about this book more than everything else, while the plot was good and the characters a treat, the true jem in this book is the realism...I could almost imagine that this had quite possibly really happened. And in fact, there are some real-life murder cases that bear a strong resemblence to this novel...Great job, Mr. Starling! A high recommendation here."
3,A good crime drama.,"First I've got to admit I enjoy reading book reviews. And I know I'm missing something, however, for the life of me I can't figure what that might be. These are works of fiction. Within its genre this is a good book. Psychological thrillers, and crime dramas are not my favorites but I do enjoy a good one now and again. And Messiah is a good one, perhaps three and a half stars. The writing is good, and the story flows - it kept my interest. As to it being contrived, who knows what lurks within the minds of really crazy people. And this book contains its share of those. Which, for me, made it all the more interesting. There were a couple editing errors which upsets me, and it takes place in London, however, I think Mr. Starling did a good job, and I recommend it."
1,A Huge Disapointment!,"OK,I was really looking forward to reading this after all the great reviews it got but after the first chapter I knew it was not for me!!The big reason I love murder thrillers is the author putting you in the demented killers shoes and the hunt the police go through to find him... This book was entirely one sided- you only got the inspectors viewpoint so that ended any sort of suspense for me. Obviously many people loved this book but it certainly wasn't me!!Sorry."
2,hmm...,"Well, it looks as if I'm in the minority here but I have to say that I didn't think this book was that great. It was very predictable and I never found myself really caring much about the characters.The references to Silence of the Lambs made me laugh once I had finished the book. Starling's characters come nowhere near the complexity of those in the Harris novels. I do agree however that it follows Seven very closely.The one good thing I have to say is that the book is a quick read and easy to follow."
2,"Too predictable, but good for a first novel.",I had this book figured out 2/3's of the way through. Had to make myself finish it. I was disappointed. The book had potential to be a masterpiece.
1,Disappointed,"I must be in the minority, too. I really did not find this book ""brilliant"" or ""stunning"". I have definately read worse books, but this one in no way compares to any of the books written by Thomas Harris. It has none of their depth or originality. I'm afraid I found it rather predictable, too. All in all, I was very disappointed by the book, but I hope that Starling will improve and mature with his later efforts."
3,Killer Thriller,"For a story about a serial killer, this one is fresh and original. It is somewhat dark with many surprising twists. The particulars of the case are rehashed a little too frequently, but otherwise a very good read."
4,Stunning Debut!,"Boris Starling's freshman novel reads as though he's been writing fiction for decades! The spiraling plot crescendos into a surprising ending that will stay with you long after you've finished reading.Following Detective Inspector Red Metcalfe as he untangles the web of an investigation into a brutal serial killer takes the reader on a wild ride that continues to build, little by little, keeping interest and suspense high throughout. Red's characterization is thorough and we become voyeurs as we watch him peal back the layers of the killer's mind, putting his own sanity at risk. I liked the fact that Red is not infallible, he is a real person who exposes his flaws and accepts responsibility for them.This is one of those murder mysteries that provides a plot twist at the end that doesn't disappoint. Messiah is a taut thriller that will keep you flipping pages start to finish!"
5,Excellent Read!,Messiah will take you on a bone-chilling ride into the mind of a killer you wouldn't suspect. This is one of the best books I have ever read! It is the most suspenseful books on the market today. You're in for late nights staying up and reading if you by this book. It's as addicting as any tobacco.
5,Best Book Ever,Messiah is the best book ever. I am a high shcool student and that is one of the only books that I have been able to truly get into. The killer in Messiah is the smartest character that I have ever come across in all the reading that I've done. His ideas and methods were pure genius. Anyone who can handle the grusome descriptions should read this book.
5,"The most ""in-your-face"" murder book I've read!","There's nothing restrained about Messiah, a book awash with blood, mutilation, family conflicts and over the top religious symbolism.Despite often patchy writing and some one-dimensional stereotyped secondary characters, Messiah manages to stay a class above the many other wannabe serial murder thrillers. Many other books also offer a twist at the end that supposedly, ""you'll never guess"". In Messiah, a couple of times you think you spot it, but you really WON'T guess this one. Many books contrive human failings for their detective heroes to make them more realistic, but you'd never predict the true nature of Red Metcalfe, the complex and tortured main character of Messiah.Read it, murder fans! DON'T flip to the last pages first! And if you enjoy this book, then don't miss Val McDermid's ""The Mermaids Singing"", it's like this but even better, I promise..."
2,Starry-Eyed,"I'm a little bewildered by all the 5 star ratings given to this book. Sure it's a fast read but it doesn't approach the standards for the genre, i.e. ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" (from which some ideas for the plot appear to be lifted, but without the same effect). The murder scenes were written well but large sections of the book just come off as filler. The characterization of ""Red"", the relentless hunter of ""Silver Tongue"", while voluminous, didn't seem to draw him out all that well and the minor characters were the equivalent of card board cut outs.I bought this book based on the mega ratings it received here and my two stars won't drop it's overall rating one iota. But to potential buyers I say ""Lower your expectations."""
4,An Original Thriller of Biblical Proportions,"Clearly one of the most original thriller plots I've read this year. Sometimes a religious or biblical undertone can make a thriller more sinister; downright ""creepy"".Starling did a great job of building the suspense in this one. Despite some less-than stellar writing at times, overall it was an excellent first effort and I look forward to more work from him. My only diappointment was that I was able to pick the killer about midway through the story. It still had an interesting, and rather unpredictable ending."
5,Great Thriller,Each character of this thrilling novel has his secret and you'll never guess as you read along what nightmarish secrets they are. You just won't believe it. You just won't guess who the messiah is... Thank you Mr Starling. What wonderful thrilling hours I've spent.
4,Vividly Magnificent,"When I read a book and am able to actually *see* it as a movie in my mind, I know I have found an intriguing novel. Through the gore & grizzly scenes, the depth & inter-play of the characters kept me grounded. Superb plot! And here I thought I had it all figured out! A good read. Should make a good movie. Question: Even though it is set in London, did anyone else picture the actor Morgan Freeman as *Red*?"
3,What's With The Dates?,"Although I am not finished with Messiah, I am thoroughly frustrated to the point that I may stop reading it.The book begins on Friday May 1st, 1998, and on that date two bodies are found. The next date, Friday February 12th, 1982, sixteen years earlier, begins chapter four. While I understand the concept of flashbacks, I can not understand how the two bodies found in 1998 can be discussed in 1982. The next date, Thursday, February 18th, 1982 begins chapter nine, and again the same deaths are discussed. The next date, Saturday, May 2nd 1998 begins chapter 18, and is followed by an interlude which is chapter 20.The story line remains the same regardless of the year, but it is confusing and I think impossible. Three months have gone by and yet the crimes seem to span 16 years.Have I lost my mind, or have the dates been confused?Someone please let me know what I have missed.MBENO123@AOL.COM"
4,Fast paced suspence with plenty to keep you guessing.,I picked this book up on vacation on London and sat up all night reading it. An excellent view of criminal investigations in England. The story had plenty of twists and turns and a nice little shocker at the end.
1,Extremely biased documentary - do not watch unless you are a Fatah or Hizbolla fan,"What can you expect from an extremely left wing organization that has promotion of self-hate as its core agenda? What a waste of time. A great platform for Jew haters (and self hating Jews) that can lash out under the guise of humanitarian concerns. It's the new antisemitism, no less."
3,Packaging Review,"I just received this item. Season 1-5, 18 disks in one set. It literally IS 18 disks...in a box. You open the box and out falls 18 disks, each one in a sleeve. No cases, no booklets - just a box with 18 disks in it. If you search around you can find this set very cheaply and if you are a big fan of weeds and simply want the episodes and dont mind putting them in a CD case, this set is for you. Otherwise, purchase Seasons separatelyUPDATE 2012:I have long since gotten rid of this set. It was obviously bootleg as it had commercials and homemade menus - I dont know if they all do or I just got scammed - oh well. buyer beware."
2,disapointed,The DVD's I have purchased in the past have been perfect. But I purhased the Weeds seasons 1-5 and several of the disc's do not play correctly. Very unhappy with what was sent to me.
1,Terrible product,While I enjoy the Weeds series - obviously the reason for the purchase - virtually all of the disks contained unplayable sections. Miserable product.
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I purchased this workbook/cd to teach my 4-year-old daughter Spanish and was surprised by the poor quality of the book, the lessons and the cd. The book is cheaply made (no color, low-res graphics, thin paper, only 59 pages) and the lessons were not engaging to my child. The accompanying cd only pronounced the vocabulary words (no games, music, themes, etc.) The flash cards at the back should have been perforated and on thicker paper. Also, there are only twelve flash cards which seems like a waste of time. I purchased other beginning Spanish books/cds for children (Speak in a Week, Spanish for Children, I Can Read & Speak in Spanish) and was very pleased with these publications. I paid more for this workbook ($29) because of the rave reviews. I'm not sure why everyone else seems so happy with Flip Flop Spanish but I wanted to share my thoughts. I am returning this to Amazon."
5,Great Workbook,I heard about this book from a relative. I decided my four year granddaughter and I should give it a whirl since she is such a Dora the Explorer Fan. I was a little leery since I know no other languages nor am I a teacher. We have had a great time time learning Spanish together!! The CD is a huge help. The lesson segments are short enough to leave us wanting more and the flip flop concept keeps us from skipping around. I certainly recommend this book.
5,Wow,"Ulysses Siren was part of the thrash metal explosion back in the mid-80s in the Bay Area. Due to the huge amount of bands that emerged during the time, obviously some got overlooked. Ulysses Siren was one of them.The problem is, I don't understand why. Ulysses Siren is better than probably 99% of all other thrash bands...and yes, this includes the Big Four (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax).This album will kick you right in the teeth. It's sheer brutality is unbelievable. It's fast and heavy and loud, just like thrash metal ought to be. Not just that, but Ulysses Siren were excellent musicians, and this album showcases their talent well.Basically, imagine Dark Angel taking the 1980's versions of Slayer and Metallica, grilling them over a fire made with vintage Megadeth, adding a helping of Overkill and a slice of Testament and then serving it to Exodus for breakfast and you'll be in the ballpark.Ulysses Siren is the best thrash I've ever heard. Period."
5,THRASH!!!,"I can't believe we have only had two reviews for this highly underrated band. Ulysses Siren could have been something great if they could stay together. Above the Ashes is an amazing album. In fact it is better than some of the stuff the Big Four put out. Levithian is a great instrumental. My favorite tracks are Above the Ashes, The Reich, and No Trace of Shame. All in all, this is great album too bad its been a forgotten relic of the thrash era."
1,not worth the time or the effort,"I absolutely hated this book and thought that it was a complete waste of time. Never in my life have I ever read a book so porely written before. There was no character development, the story was fragmented and never came to a conclusive ending. I would suggest skipping this one and reading one of his other books that are much better. ""Fumi: the fanatic fiance"" ""The Canadian Tennis player and me"" and ""Track Girl""."
1,Blah,"I found that this story wasn't very compelling, or endearing and was hardly thought provoking, except for the initial thought of ""why did I ever choose this book!"""
1,hmmm,"It's too bad that the only option is to give it one star. If I had a chance I would give it half a star or maybe even a quarter. I had read the other reviews and just decided to get my own opinion and so I read it anyways. MISTAKE!!! I should have taken their advice and stayed away from this book. Horrible, boring, just plain bad."
2,a stronger style would match strength of content,"A sad and angry memoir of Dr. Wilson's impressions as a child growing up in the ghetto. He hopes to shed some light for children who still grow up with no hope and no chances.It was hard to get through, not as it should have been-for content, but for style. He jumps around a lot, not only from place to place, but also forward and backward in time. The situations are so much alike that it is hard to follow the first fifteen chapters. I like how he uses his poetry, although like the book, it is one dimensional and angry/pessimistic.A memorable passage:pg. 17 from ""Struggling"": When your hunger turns to anger and your anger turns to hate,/you stop caring and welcome any fate,/YOU KNOW YOU'RE STRUGGLING.In the end, I respect him for having the strength and courage to get past his childhood, and to be able to write about it."
5,Great story and a great young man.,"I had the pleasure to meet the author of this book last weekend in Pullman, WA and was inspired to go buy and read his book.I'm glad I did. What a great young man who has a lot to offer the youth today. I recommend this book to all educator's and coaches and anyone else who deals with today's youngsters."
3,REally cute but useless,"I just got mine and decided to see how the drawstring works...well it practically DOESNT! It's almost impossible to pull it tight and back open, I guess the material around it is too tight.Looks wonderful though, I hope I can find a solution for the problem!"
2,Not the best,"I was looking for a book to introduce my 3.5 year old to the real meaning of Christmas. Unfortunately, this is NOT the right book to purchase. It doesn't flow while trying to read it to your child. Also, it doesn't explain the story in a format for a child that young. Even an older child wouldn't be captivated by this book. Basically it's boring."
1,Very porly done,"More fantasy than fact, this is a fourth-rate biography that is a waste of all effort involved, including the reader's time."
3,Fasctual Errors,"I was disappointed at the factual errors in this book as well as the poor proofreading. On the edition I read the jacket itself refers to Edward as King Edward VII rather than King Edward VIII. The name of Wallis's chauffeur is spelled both Ladbrook and Ladbrooke on successive pages. The decorator Stephan Boudin is said to be with the Maison Jensen rather than Maison Janson. The most egregious error was on p. 395 where the author states that the motto of the Prince of Wales is ""Dieu et mon Droit"" when the correct motto is ""Ich Dien.""One hopes these errors were corrected in subsequent editions of this book."
2,OK until you run out of notes,"I purchased this organizer on Amazon more than three months ago. Since then, the pen has started to show wear in the form of loose joints and tarnished finish.Biggest flaw: I cannot find a notepad of the correct size to use as a refill. If someone finds 2 1/4"" x 4"" notepads for cheap, please let me know! 3"" x 5"" seems to be the smallest standard, and the product description does not specify the notepad's dimensions.If you are implementing GTD, do yourself a favor and get a separate notepad holder."
1,Returned item,"Was looking for a thin pad, looked like it could work - still too thick for a suit pocket. Nice pad, but not what I was looking for."
5,Very Practical Jotter Organizer,Brother got me this as a gift and I love it. Very practical item that fits in my pocket and very handy for jotting down notes on the fly. Would definitely reccomend and love the leather quality. Very beautiful
1,Royce Mini Leather Jotter Organizer,Very light weight. Doesn't look much like the picture. Leather may be real but it feels like cheap fake in your hand. Pockets were a nice touch but a little loose. You would have to fill the pockets to keep anything in them. No snap closure so be careful how you carry it. The dark brown is not the shiny reddish dark brown as shown but a dingy flat brown. Great idea but poor execution in selecting the materials. Not a good value.
4,"A must for lovers of travel, motorcycles, and free-spirits","I had a fantasy on the bus going to work. I wondered what all the grim faces would be like if I could give everyone a copy of Ted Simon's ""Riding Home."" Maybe they'd all be dreaming about doing themselves what Ted did and described in ""Jupiter's Travels""-- leave it all behind and ride a motorcycle around the world. Down through Africa, round South America and north to California. Then on to Australia and up from Singapore into Asia. ""Riding Home"" happily contains plenty of flashbacks and additional stories of adventures from Ted's famous ride. But it also describes him leaving his ancient farmhouse in southern France, finding a new love, and settling down into a whole new place, a whole new life. For anyone who read Simon's bestselling ""Jupiter's Travels"" -- one of the great tales of travel and adventure -- and wished it wouldn't end, ""Riding Home"" is a must."
5,Please remove this from my CD player!,The songs on this compulsively listenable album go straight to the pleasure center of the brain . . . and refuse to leave. This young duo has a production team and writers who spin insanely tuneful and beautifully orchestrated numbers. You don't need to speak Spanish to fall for this CD.
2,hmmm,Well I ordered the two t shirts in a larger size and still have not received them. I let the seller know. I get things pretty quick here but I dont know what happened this time.
4,Awesome 24 Memorabilia,I get complements from everyone on it. It is a dark navy blue. The shirt isn't as comfortable as your run of the mill Abercrombie shirt but it's nice.
4,Fun for kiddies,I like this traditional story. It's fun to read to my little grandson & he loves the repititon of the wolf huffing & puffing.
3,price must be wrong,I was looking for a nice cocoa to buy from Amazon but I can get this exact same item at my already-overpriced local health food shop for $4.79. The suggested retail price on the one I bought at the store says $5.99 so all I can assume is that Amazon simply has the price wrong on this item. How could it possibly be over $12? Maybe they could send three for that price.
3,Just average.,"As much as I love the Ghirardelli baking bars for baked goods, ganaches, etc., I found their cocoa powder lacking in taste."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought this heater to go under my desk at work. While the turn knob is simple and is suppose to allow various settings, I have not had the experience of enjoying any settings. The heater shuts off within a minute. It doesn't matter what temperature I set it at. It will not go back on unless I unplug the heater and let it sit for 5 min. I think my co-workers have seen me under my desk fidgeting with the heater more than actually up at my desk doing work. I will definitely be returning it."
2,Poor design,Loud and not adjustable -- it is either full on or off. I got mine for $10 and it's not worth that.
2,"Creates lots of heat, but doesn't have much blowing power","Bought this unit last week to put next to my desk at work, but I haven't been completely happy with it.The heater turns on and heats up instantly, but it is more like an open oven door than a space heater. The heat is there, but the fan in the unit doesn't have much blowing power... so you end up with heat for 1 or 2 feet in front of the unit but not 4 or 5 feet in front of the unit. I had it under my desk today and couldn't figure out where the heat was going... it sure wasn't circulating around anywhere.The unit does put off a lot of heat... unfortunately I couldn't find a happy medium between cooked ankles and cold ankles.I like the simple temp knob on top, but I end up leaning over to turn it up and down all day as I get cold and hot.If I were shopping again I would get a unit with more than one level of heat, more than one fan speed, and an on/off switch so I don't have to unplug it every day.Stay warm!"
4,"""My New Hero!""","I am a cranky wannabe, and Bob Woodiwiss is my new hero. This guy is FUNNY!!!!! Bitter and acerbic, too, but mainly, just funny."
5,"Made me laugh, and think","This book had me laughing out loud at points, which is rare for me while reading, or really anytime. I thoroughly enjoyed this compilation of satirical and topical essays and found the humor provocative. It delivers some serious, edgy topics in a way where the prose virtually makes fun of itself - similar to the effect of an infinity mirror."
5,A Good Read,At its best The Kind of Things Saints Do got under my skin and wrapped itself around my soul holding me captive from sentence to sentence. At its worst i was simply engaged. This collection of short stories is worth the five or six hour investment of time it takes to finish the read. Throughout the book there is a wide range of psychologically charged characters. Valeri does a fine job depicting complex characters whether a young girl or an old man. The Miami setting in many of the stories also helps push the tales along for Miami is always a complicated and interesting set.
4,Very Good Trimmer,I have had this trimmer for a few years and it runs very well. It is powerful enough for my occasional trimming around the yard. My only issue is the safety button in the handle that you must press for the machine to run--it's a little awkward for me but it's not bad enough to prevent me from recommending. Good tool for a good price.
1,questions...,question...i am interested in the mcculloch #mt203a22 hedge trimmer. asin#80001q2w4u. the product description says standard cord retention clipo keeps the cord out of the way. charging station included?????is it electric or cordless. also the shipping weight is 55.66 pounds...what is the weight of the trimmer? thank you
5,EBC Brake Pads,EBC Greenstuff 6000 Series have been used by me as replacements on the following vehicles: 2000 BMW Z-3; 1997 Ford Explorer XLT; & 1998 Forf F-150 2x. These are great pads and I highly recommend them.
4,Great Speakers,"Good quality speakers, I use with my Motorola Q at work almost everyday. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a remote to control the volume."
2,Poor fidelity bass-heavy flubby audio quality,I use this speaker primarily to listen to news and audio books on my iPhone 4 in the morning while I shower. The fidelity is so bass-heavy and inarticulate that I have to raise the volume far higher than comfortable before the spoken words become comprehensible above the din of the shower. I would have expected that audio quality would be a non-issue for me because I use it to listen to spoken word rather than music; not so. I regret this purchase and wish I had spent more money on a proper Bluetooth speaker.
3,Works as advertised but mediocre sound,"I bought this for use with my phone (as mp3 player) in an off-grid cabin. It paired immediately with my LG 8350, and worked without a hitch. The sound quality is muddled and the ""always on"" bass boost is irritating. However, it was cheap and will fit the bill for what I need. I was considering a second unit for my patio but will look for something else with better sound."
1,Didnt work,I ordered this speaker for a Chrismas gift for a family member that lives out of state. After he recieved the gift and he tried several times to get it to work but it wouldnt bluetooth right? I contacted the company (East Tech) to exchange it because thats what he wanted but they dont do exchanges only returns with a credit to my account. I think East Tech need to expand there customer service skills. I understand when thinks dont work but I dont understand is if you want to do an exchage for the same product they wont let you?? I'm not blaming Sony for there product just East Tech for the hassel..
4,Good Value,"Great sound and very straight forward usage. Actually gets very loud for a portable speaker. I use it golfing and can hear it 150ft from the cart. Range is only about 10ft. Worth the money if you want some portable music. Don't expect hifi, but the sound is still very surprising given that it is a BT unit."
2,not gift friendly! and not very loud,"The item ships in it's box, I had it shipped to my parents house, and they saw what their gift was. Just a warning.Sound barely gets louder than macbook, not worth it."
4,The European Backstreet Boys!,"Are you from America? Do you think that the Backstreet Boys aren't really a boy band but a vocal group? Well, here's a new vocal group from Ireland worth knowing about. Here's the 411 on them: They can all sing, for real. They are definitely cute. BSB is one of their bigget musical inspirations, and their songs definitely show it. Although they only released 1 album in the US, the lads are soon coming here to conquer America. If you're a fan who wants to know more upclose and personal stuff regarding Mark, Nicky, Bryan, Shane, and/or Kian, this is a nice collector's item to have with fabulous pics of the guys."
3,anggun in it!,"all the songs in this album are new,created specially for this movie.many artist in it such as anggun,lou bega,meja, etc.the theme song, help im a fish also can keep the partys goin.basicly all of the songs here have topic such as ocean,love,happiness.what mesmerise me most is the track by anggun, ocean love.her voice really suit the song and the theme of the movie.the music is relaxing and her voice carry the meaning to it's deep soul.i guess it makes me melt deep into the ocean of love."
2,Supertramp fans should read this before buying!,"What we have here is a critical review of all of the tracks that appear on Supertramp's ""Crime Of The Century,"" plus several tracks from ""Crisis? What Crisis?"" and a few more from ""Even In The Quietest Moments."" But do we really need a breakdown of all the songs to realize the true power of these songs? Perhaps if this DVD would have covered ""Breakfast In America"" and allowed full clips of the songs covered instead of pieces it would have been better, do yourselves a big favour and buy the groups individual CD's and leave this DVD to music classrooms where it really belongs. BTW we Supertramp fans are still waiting quite patiently for ""Paris"" to be put on DVD!!!!!"
2,Time for Paris DVD,Agreed. Paris tapes found in Bob's barn in late 2006. I am patiently waiting for the DVD release of this pinnacle concert (November 1979 - Breakfast in America tour).
5,Fun Fantasy read for younger kids,"The Dragon Slayers' Academy children's book series is really fun for kids. Kids who love Harry Potter, but are maybe too young for such a big book can get started with this series, both my son and daughter, ages 8 and 10, love these and have read all of them so far. Great book to keep kids reading."
3,Lots of Pig Latin,"This a fabulous series! My 8 yearold son loves it! This particular book (#14: Pig Latin--Not Just for Pigs!) is a great story, but quite difficult to read because of the abundance of pig latin."
4,Solid Effort,"This is a solid introductory effort to supply chain management and the integral function and role SCM plays in contemporary business.The authors do an excellent job describing the importance of operational excellence in an age of increased globalization. The authors also do a superb job in emphasizing the role SCM plays in shareholder value, and how SCM can be used as an X factor in forging competitive advantage.The only fault I see with the book is the focus on speed instead of authoritative SCM optimization. Charles Fine's Clockspeed and other works handle supply, demand, delivery issues in a more balanced and lucid manner."
5,"Paul Asbell, Master Music Crafter","I met Paul several years ago at a guitar pull in Georgia. At the time, he was just one of many really good musicians and entertainers I met that weekend. When I started buying Paul's CDs, he really separated himself from so many others. Paul's CDs have been in one of the CD slots in my player since I received them. They never get old and I never get tired of listening to them. Working and recording in the music business in Georgia for many years, most of my CD listening has to do with work. Paul's music is simply pleasure, though I do attempt to do a couple of the songs now and then. Paul has such high standards, it's hard for me to pull them off. Purchase Paul's CDs and you will be thanking yourself for years to come. Thanks to Paul for the music."
2,Pretty good hedge clipper,"The good news: I have gotten quite a bit of use out of the hedge trimmer in this package. The battery holds enough juice to get the job done at my in-town residence. I have a corner lot, and a 4-5 foot hedge that runs 50' down the avenue and about 100' down the street. I have used it to cut Kerraganda and cedar bushes, with little problems with branch size.The bad news: I fried the string trimmer the first time I used it (possibly operator error - I've only used gas and corded electrics before) and the blower is severely underpowered.The verdict: If you can, go with a corded electric or gas for better string trimmer and blower results. If you can get the hedge trimmer by itself, it's not a bad deal."
1,First Amazon disappointment,"I ordered this item, as I have many items from Amazon and it did not arrive after two months. I cancelled the order."
4,"Perfect, cheaper than Staples but...","But (?) There is no black ink cartridge. Costco used to sell a similar package but it also included a black ink cartridge.Luckily, I had a black one left over (for when I thought I could just replace what I needed not all of them at one time)."
1,DO NOT FALL FOR THESE SCAMMERS!!!,"These ink cartridges have either been sitting for years or are a fake. Bought it not long ago, I probably printed 5-6 8.5x11 documents with some colors in it and now it prints in 2 colors. These are not EPSON original it's some scam. In fact, the cartridges appear to be full of ink but the colors are horrible. DO NOT BUY."
2,"Great price, but look out for a mess","Product arrived quickly, packaging was good. As I installed the new cartridges, in the process of removing the tab, ink leaked out all over the place. A better way to describe the leak may be the words 'gushed out'. I suspect that my living at 8000 feet above sea level may have caused a pressure difference, but I have NEVER, EVER had ink cartridges leak out. It seemed that once the pressure equalized, the leak stopped. I still have ink stains in my carpet that I have not been able to remove..."
4,Epson Black Ink,"I have given this a 4 star rating because it prints very well, but sure doesn't last long. I am a light usage printer too. I have tried a number of ink cartridge substitutes with poor to bad results: ink leakage, inaccurate color reproduction, and constant cleaning to keep these cartridges working properly. So, I am forced reluctantly to return to this retail product. Other than short lasting, my real major complaint is cost. A combination of the color cartridges and black cartridge cost as much as the cost of the printer. I have no proof, but have long suspected price fixing among the printer cartridge manufacturers. I have long since slowed my printing to essentials only."
4,Good price.,Got just what I needed at a good price. I have an older printer and not everyone caries the ink I need.
4,epson 48 To48920 inkjet cartridge color multipack 1 cyan 1 light cyan 1 magenta 1 light magenta 1 yellow,this multipack color cartridge is just what I wanted and it fits my epson printer again I have recommended it to all my friends but alass many have different printers and will therefore not be purchasing the same multipack for their use but they will probably purchase a multipack to fit their machine
4,epson T048120 48 inkjet cartridge black,this is really great black I enjoy using it and I have recommended it to all my friends unfortunately many of my friends have different printers and therefore cannot use this cartridge packet
2,Use to be a good value,"I ordered this same cartridge in June and paid $13.68. It was a good price and I was happy with the product. When I went to reorder today, it was $18.40. It went up almost $5.00 for the same cartridge in 3 months. I think I'll check out my local office supply store instead. They still sell it for about $14.50."
1,"Ink was not a full cartridge, really disappointed","This cartridge did not even allow me to print 500 copies before it ran out of ink, a total waste of my time and money."
4,great price,"Can't beat the price on this pack, with free shipping. Standard, high quality epson inks."
5,"Works great, cheaper than individual colors","You really want to buy the multipack of colors for ink replacement; it saves you time and money over the individual colors. I wish they included a black cartridge in also, but I'm sure it wouldn't be free."
5,epson ink,Nothing beats genuine Epson ink. I would not use anything but genuine Epson ink in either of my two printers. Quality is number one.
2,Black cartridge is not included,"I am conditioned to purchasing this item at the store where the black cartridge is included in the multipack. This one does not have it so you have to purchase it seperately. This way you pay double the amount of money on shipping charges and you have to wait till you receive it. Meanwhile, tough luck if you run out of ink. Yeah; it is a little cheaper here but it all evens out with the shipping charges. Next time I'm going back to the store where you can get all six cartridges in one multipack."
3,too pricey,"I'll give it one more star, if the price drops by couple of hundred thousand dollars.But then the printers are so cheap (and you are not paying sales tax on this ink) that it may not be a bad deal at all"
4,Products first Purchase,"This is the first time that I have purchased this particular product, but, I believe that it will meet the standards that Epson abides by."
3,...ok?,"Okay, I don't get it. ALL of these FIFTEEN reviews were written on either October 29 or 30th. What are these people talking about it having a $1,000,000 price tag?? It costs $13.49!!! The only reason it's sold at this price is because it's the same size as the other color ones at the same price. The larger black ink cartridge for the CX6400 is almost twice as big, that's why it costs more. Gosh, people these days.But apart from that, I guess the cartridge is okay, I mean, what can you say about an ink cartridge. I had the printer to this cartridge -- BAD printer, the R300. Never worked. But I guess the ink was aight."
3,Ok cartridges...,I swear they run out real quick but I think it is just Epson... being Epson... Work great with my R300.
3,"Good, but","it's inconvenient to get the black cartridge from Amazon, then colored ones from other vendors."
5,Perfect for Epson RX500.,These are Epson inks and worked perfectly in my RX500 printer. I have had problems with using non-Epson ink (the colours didn't come out correctly) so I use only Epson ink now. No problems at all with the printer recognising any of these cartridges or printing.
5,Epson quality,The cartridge inserts easily and the ink doesn't run or smear.Epson makes a quality product but ink prices are just to high for how quickly it runs out. I bought my epson printer for $39.99 and have just spent over $70 on ink?!
3,"Ony 5 cartridges, not 6","Be aware that there is no black cartridge included in this multipack--I didn't notice, and almost ordered it. You can get a better price per cartridge at S*ms Club, since their multipack includes all 6 carts. In fairness to Epson, however, I've found that if you do a lot of color photo printing, the black cart is used less than the other ones, so maybe that's why they make a multipack with no black."
1,Did not work with other original cartriges!!,I just wanted 2 replace the black ink in my printer without replacing the other colors. It did not work! It was working before the original black ink was emptied!!
4,color pack,"Received as ordered. I thought there would be a black included, silly me. Shudda read the description better. Anyhow, they did and are still fully functional."
4,Works just fine,I got this for my Epson R220 and use it to print greyscale documents at home. I popped it in and was able to print right away. I'm not sure how many pages I'll get from it but I don't do a lot of printing so it works fine for my needs.
2,epson is the worst,"Not fair to the ink that I hated this printer so much, but this expensive set of cartridges dried up just as fast as the cheaper no-names... go figure. I finally wised up and bought another brand of printer."
5,R300 ink cartridge,"works well, just like the original. Never had a nozzle gum up with this brand. I'll use these againjohn (:>)))"
2,Nothing in the box,"This is great ink, but I received an empty box! I have purchased this ink before, but I think with the rush from the Holidays somehow they missed it."
1,Outdated ink from Triple Net/Always Deals,"On 4/23/09 I received 2 packages of genuine Epson printer ink from Always Deals as ordered from Triple Net, but one was marked ""use before 11.2006"", the other ""use before 06.2006"".I wouldn't trust this company again."
3,Almost the best price,"The price for this multi-pack is much better than buying the colors individually. However, my local warehouse store(BJ's)sells this product for just three dollars more. The up side is that the BJ's multi-pack includes the black ink cartridge. I suggest people keep shopping."
3,On the Shelf for a Long Time,FYI. I discovered product date is 2 1/2 years old. It is still within the use before date and works fine (2 years left). Think about it - yours could be longer. The product date on the cartridges I replaced are less than six months now. Hence they were fresh when I bought them.
3,Misleading,"These are old, expired Epson cartridges that this company probably buys for pennies on the dollar and passes on the savings to consumers. All of the expiration codes are sctratched off. They seem to work ok and are cheap enough but I don't completely trust a company who is intentionally misleading and lacking full disclosure. It would have been nice to know exactly what I was buying. Caveat emptor."
1,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING!,"The item is called ""Epson T048920 Color Ink Cartridge Multipack"". First of all there is not a black included in the pack. My bad for not seeing that. But, they call it an Epson product and what I got was a smashed box filled with all different cartridge labels. NOT one said Epson!! The package does not appear to be NEW a product. I believe this is a refilled product and feel I was misled by the title. Lesson learned! Will not order from them again. As long as I order directly from Amazon, I don't usually have a problem, but my experience has not been so good with other retailers....Just sayin'"
3,Multipack? = No Black,Please be aware that this so called Multipack does not contain a black ink cartridge. I use my Epson R220 for photos only and the black is used up as quickly as the reds and blues. Be sure to order a seperate black ink cartridge.
4,No black cartridge!,"I didn't read the full product description, so was surprised to find, when the product was delivered, that it does not include a black cartridge. Ah, so that's why it was $20 cheaper than Staples..."
1,*FALSE ADVERTISING*...BEWARE!!,"This is not NEW EPSON INK (as it states and shows on the picture)...I received a re-manufactured cartridge from this company...SHAME ON THEM!...It was not stated anywhere that is was going to be re-manufactured ink...have not tried it yet, but I have a problem with company's that mis-lead their customers"
5,Still the best price in town!,"This is just a follow-up to my last review that was the same ink just another color. I will continue to use amazon, as long as they keep giving me great prices and service!"
3,Epson Color Ink Cartridge Multipack,"These cartridges arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. They are easily installed in my Epson Stylus PHOTO R320 printer, which I do like very much. My only problem is that they are so costly. It seems to me that there ought to be a way for Epson to produce these necessary cartridges at a greater savings. Yes, one can purchase non-Epson in cartridges, but my experience with different brands of those has been very negative."
4,Epson T048920 Color Ink Cartridge Multipack,This item arrived in good condition during the time frame promised. It is a quality product which works well in the computer printer. Thank you for delivering this product as promised.
2,Rip Off,"Epson ink is a rip off. Pages nowhere near the advertised number. They work well but don't last. Most ink cartridges are the same, they give away the printer and make their money on ink."
1,Smudges vs. runs!,"This ink may not smudge much, but it sure runs - a lot!! The least bit of moisture and the words become illegible. I'm going back to HP -- as long as I'm getting ripped off on outrageous ink prices, I may as well at least get something that will hold up."
1,Deceptive advertising,"Epson never mentions this model 48920 ""multi Pak"" lacks a black cartridge which must be purchased separately and is more expensive than the others. They also fail to advise they do sell a ""Multi Pak"" that includes black. I found it at BJ's Warehouse for $64.99. The Epson package is marked ""TO481-9-SV"". However you cannot find it on a product ""lookup"" on Amazon or at the office supply stores. In fact you can't even find it on the Epson.com website. Intentional oversight? Yes, I think so. I wonder what other information about their products Epson is withholding? Epson should be ashamed."
5,The price is right.,"I wish these would last longer. I wish they were cheaper. But that said, and we all know what's going on here with printers and ink, the price is better than what you'll pay elsewhere."
4,Price is Right,"As with ALL Epson cartridges, they are one step ahead of the complaints by bringing out HIGH capacity supplies. The only way to find value for money is to buy at the cheapest price for an original product.Amazon's price with no postage (Prime Member) fits the bill.The PRICE is Right"
5,Great price,"Because I print up photos, I like to use the real McCoy as far as my printer ink is concerned. Because I am cheap, I don't like to spend a lot.My purchase of Epson Ink at Adorama Camera made me happy on both accounts"
4,Better than a refurb,"What can I say. It is an ink cartridge. However, for the price, it was a good purchase and delivered a bit ahead of promised. I have used discounted cartridge generics that for the most part are refills. Although black is black, I found the refill products to often be leaky so I'll stick with Epson and this supplier for now. I use more black than color so getting a few at a time is about the same price as a single at the local office supply store."
2,A little overboard with the emotional stories.,"In a way, this book did not motivate me because of all the anecdotes. They were enough to make me gag. As a beginner runner who does not feel that passionate about running yet, it can certainly turn you off. For example, one story is about a woman who just got some bad news about some test results. It goes on to say that the first thing she did was ""lace up her shoes and run- with tears streaming down her face, she ran towards the sun set."" I don't mean to sound insensitive, but it can be a little overwhelming to read these stories constantly through out the book when you are just starting out and trying to ""enjoy"" running."
5,Good encouragement for women runners!,"I became a runner later in life and started running because it is inexpensive and convenient. I have been an intermediate runner for the last 4 years and have completed 2 half-marathons. Last year I hit a rut and lost my motivation to run. I enjoy the feeling of running consistently and needed something to help me get back into running again. This book provides a good background on women and running, and has helped me understand that we all go through our peaks and valleys with our training. The chapters that cover walking to jogging and jogging to running has reminded me of the fundamentals that I need to get back into a consistent running schedule."
4,great for beginners,"This gave me the motivation to get up and go. This was the little extra push I needed.Awesome read, it made me realize that it takes time and patience, to get to where I wanted to be in only a week's time.I have not yet finished, but I am much better than where I was."
4,Great book with overall understanding of running tailored to women!,"I have been running for just over a year and am a ""newbie"" in many ways. I have read a few other books on running but liked this one because it is tailored to female runners. With an overview of running, from nutrition to running injury free, I have found this book to be an asset."
5,Great book for everyone!,I read this book and it helped me with simple questions that I was too afraid to ask anyone else.
5,The Perfect Motivational Guide,"I have been running for five years now, and there has always been many questions regarding the sport. I found that in the past, this has been primarily a man's sport. What a great idea to write a book focusing on the concern's of women. I felt more empowered and ready to lace up my shoes and go. This was truely a great motivational and informative book."
3,A little disappointed!,"I was so looking forward to getting this book. And I was disappointed. It is ok but not quite ""a complete book of running"" I had taken about 9 months off of running due to pregnancy and was hoping to get motivated again. This book just kind of fell short. I think a ""complete book of running"" should include some routines, that could help all levels of runners (not just the marathoners that are mentioned) and more specific diet advice. More advice on building endurance etc etc. I think this caters to marathoners and just the novice beginners. I have seen better articles written in fitness magazines!"
3,"OK overall, narrow scope","I have always enjoyed the insights in Runners World magazine and Runners World online. The information in this book, on the other hand, is not nearly as open and as diverse. While the book does in fact discuss just about every topic related to women and running, it only presents one viewpoint or solution to each. It gives one way to breathe while running, one way to train for a marathon, one idea of how much and what to consume during the day...While a good reference, it's both ""complete"" and incomplete at the same time."
5,Great,I loved this book. I loaned to many friends and loved all of it. Being a relatively new runner it was very helpful to me and got me excited to keep running.
3,Disappointed,"Personally, I was quite disappointed in the content of this book. I was getting back into running after a several year hiatus and bought this book to inspire me to a new level of fitness. I found the information to be geared towards the beginner and quickly ""outgrew"" it."
4,Good Book,This book has really helped me figure out what and when I should eat before and after runs. This is helpful since I am new to running and training for a half marathon
4,Good for running at any level,This book is good for all runners: one who is just beginning or one ready to run a marathon. I am somewhere in between so this was perfect for me. I appreciate the women specific info. Good book to reference often during your training.
3,"informative book, arrived in poor condition","So far I have nothing bad to say about the contents of the book, but I was under the impression I was receiving a new book. The cover was creased and had black stuff smeared on it. The pages were dogeared in the top corner. I was very surprised to receive a book straight from Amazon, not a private dealer, in such poor condition."
3,"Okay product, but not necessarily new..","It does works, and it fits my college wardrobe top perfectly. But when I received it, it didn't look anything like a new one - stains, yellowish dots... But overall it's okay."
2,very brittle,"I picked this up because I collect fish bones. In all, I had about 283 fish bones. This is not a good storage for anything other than old rags or yarn or ladies bras. It is very brittle, as I learned this while taking my Rubbermaid to the train station and it fell apart. I got a ticket for having fish bones in a public space."
5,Wonderful book,This is a great book. The photos of the different dogs are really good and the individual stories of the women and their dogs are very touching.
3,Nice book - outrageous markup,"The book is wonderful and, except for a razor-thin slice across the front cover, it arrived in pristine condition. That's the happy part. The sad part is that the book had a price sticker on it of $3.99, indicating it had been part of a clearance sale, whereas the price I was charged was $21.95! I feel I was gouged by this markup. I didn't mind paying the $21.95, as this was a gift for my wife, but I think the markup was outrageous."
4,Truly Kitsch!,"This book is a rare jewel offering details about the decor of the seventies era. What was truly revered as ""in"" at the time of the book's writing, can now be considered kitsch. If you are a collector of kitsch this book is a must! From orange macrame plant hangers to the barrel poker table with matching chairs, you will find seventies kitsch here."
5,come to the table,"I had this cd before,but lost it when I moved. This cd is a great worship cd. Once you play this cd, you will want to hear it over and over again."
4,As advertized,"This ""old"" video board (the best my old Dell could take) was delivered promptly and worked fine with no installation issues."
3,Poor magnet threads,"The unit itself is ok but what lets it down is the magnet attachment for the spokes. The magnet screws on to the spokes which should be fine , except that the thread the screw goes into is plastic. Overtighten it and you are screwed!!! as the thread is knackered. Then the magnet gets loose , turns , slides up and down , twists and the unit works intermittantly or not at all. Most annoying. In the end I had to use super glue to fix it. It is a fairly basic design fault which they could easily rectify with a metal thread insert."
3,Won't work on the back wheel,"I bought this hoping that I could use it on the back wheel when the bike is on the training stand in the winter. Seems to me I read a review that said it would. Well, about the first thing I read in the instructions is that the head has to be mounted within 18 inches of the wheel magnet so I figured that idea was out the window. I tried mightily but nothing would extend the range far enough to mount the head on the handle bars. So if that is your plan, this won't work.As a workaround I just put the head on the floor next to the back wheel, so at least I can get average speed and distance.Having said that, the unit seems to work well and it looks nice. Come summer, I will just remount the magnet on the front fork and it will be fine."
2,Sub-par,"Cadence is a requirement for me. This unit comes with cadence, so I thought that it would work well. As if. The unit displays cadence if and when it wants. Ride a bit, reset it a couple times and it might work. And then, in the middle of the ride - no cadence. It has never been able to consistently display.The unit is trickier than a Rubik's cube to figure out. This is the first cyclometer I have ever owned that required a look a the users manual for anything other than setting the wheel size. It's like cramming for an exam before each ride, trying to figure out how each function works.4 displays?? The is room on the display for 4 functions at once. But the top one never displays. I am sure there is a method to turn it on, but I have not yet mastered that portions of the cube."
4,Good for the Money,"The big plus with a wireless is that you don't have to mess with the cables. it goes on very easily and quickly. I already had another Blackburn so I was familiar with the set up but still took a few minutes and the manual to get tire size and mph vs kph set up. It has a lap feature I'll probably never use and a wired cadence sensor I haven't installed yet.One knock on wireless is that you sometimes get interference. I've got about 200 miles on it so far and it did act up once when a train went by. Kept alternating between 74 and 86 mph...I wish. As soon as the train passed me by, it picked right up where it left off and didn't lose a thing.Good sized readout. For the money it does all I want it to. I'd buy another."
1,Absolute garbage,"For one week this worked like a charm and I thought it was a great little computer. It looked nice, the display was large and readable, and it had a nice feature set.Well that was then. The now is that it has died and won't come back to life. It pops in and out of consciousness once in awhile, but it's generally unresponsive. All data you enter, and all data it accumulates (such as the odometer) is gone in a flash. It's not something simple like the battery either. The green display light stays dimly on now, even after putting in a fresh battery.Based on this and one other piece of Blackburn equipment I have possessed, I will never again buy a product under that label. I am now convinced that Blackburn is synonymous with ""cheap"" (and ""cheap"" is not always a reflection of price)."
1,Horrible expirience,"Never buy this product!!! If you need the second bike option, they will charge you 35 + s/H. If your budies buy the same product you won't be able to ride with them without cross talk. And if you have a warranty issue don't call Blackburn, because they are not helping like they used to do. Buy polar or something else with customer service that delivers. This on is only going to get you frustrated every time.Product is good, if you don't have a warranty issue or if you don't have any friends who bought this also. If you talk to someone, please tell them the product is horrible, because if they buy this it will cross talk to yours or mine."
4,Classical Musicians and Singers only,"The story is an embarrassment, unworthy to share time with the great singers and musicians contained within. Vaughn Monroe and Harry James do not belong in the film because they were given poor material to work with. The creators of this film did not know what they were doing in the popular music department, nor in the story department. I would never watch this entire film again. The non-James non-Monroe music is excellent, exciting and worth buying a DVD for, because then you can skip them and the ""story"" and be happy."
3,Valuable video for the performers,"Carnegie Hall is not a very good movie. I think it was created primarily to provide a vehicle for showcasing many of the top musical talent of the day, and it remains valuable today only for that reason. Here are mini-concert performances by classical music names from the 1940's; the conductors Walter Damrosch, Bruno Walter, Artur Rodzinski, Fritz Reiner and Leopold Stokowski; singers Rise Stevens, Lily Pons, Jan Peerce and Ezio Pinza, plus pianist Arthur Rubinstein, cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and violinist Jascha Heifetz. Just being able to see Heifetz playing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto is a good reason to watch the DVD, although he only plays the first movement and it is slightly abridged. Otherwise a viewer can fast forward through the interim melodrama and mot miss anything."
2,Hollywood Dream Machine meets Classical music,"I bought this to have the Heifetz shortened version of the 1st movement of the Tschaikovsky Violin Concerto in my collection. Remember when in 1980 Perlman interrupted his concert to say to the audience ""Today is the birthday of the greatest violinist who ever lived?"" He was referring to Heifetz and his comment took in a lot of territory as no one alive had ever heard, for example, Paganini. Well I feel the same way about Heifetz. So get this one to hear Heifetz at his best. Forget the rest."
4,This is the complete version,"This film features a host of historic singers and instrumentalists in performance in Carnegie Hall, held together by a reasonably flimsy plot about a young pianist whose well-meaning but somewhat domineering mother tries to talk him out of pursuing a career in popular music. See it for the incomparable artistry of Heifetz, Rubinstein, Piatigorsky, Jan Peerce, Ezio Pinza, Stokowski, Reiner, Bruno Walter (who turns in a stunning performance of Wagner's Meistersinger Prelude), and others. While this is the complete version (includes the Rachmaninoff Vocalise sung by Lily Pons, who also sings the Bell Song from Lakme), the picture quality and sound are inferior to the release by Kino Video, which can also be purchased on Amazon.com.Carnegie Hall"
4,The Music is Good,"You would not watch this for the plot or the acting; hammy is the word which springs to mind. But the live performances of conductors, musicians and singers now long dead are priceless and will be treasured by all thise who buy this DVD."
5,"Big Sister, Little Sister","This is an adorable book for sisters of all ages. The creative photographs show such a sweet side of sisterhood. I would enjoy more books like this for gift giving. It would be wonderful to have the whole series, ie. Big Brother, Little Brother, Big Brother, Little Sister and Big Sister, Little Brother. The Big Sister, Little Sister book makes a wonderful baby gift to both the older sister and the new baby sister too."
5,cute book,very cute book no big message here that we don't tell our children everyday but they can see the pictures of siblings having fun together and this will inspire them
5,Sisters are the best,"The pictures clearly depict loving relationships between sisters. It warms my heart to look through the pages and be reminded of special times with my sisters. I would recommend this book to all sister siblings. I'm looking forward to a possible Big Brother, Little Brother!"
4,Hits The Mark,"Enjoyable and comprehensive, but editorally it's less than perfect - found misspellings and sentences which terminated midstream. Although this may not effect one's perspective, there is the question - Did I miss something important here? Examples: ""wotship"" for ""worship"" and ""Dying may not be a"" isn't completed, which leaves one hanging... Other than the few editorial gliches (publishing flaws), the book is excellent."
2,Cheap would be the word.,"I bought because of the sale price. Well you get what you pay for. It does look ok, and work ok, but there was at least three bad issues. Poor instructions. This is nothing new to me, but the problems don't stop there. The bulb coverings don't fit without bending the clips in. I didn't like that. Worse was the center screw holding the wood to the housing is way too short. Luckily I had a replacement in my ""junk"" drawer. Unfortunately the cover nut does not fit now. Off to the ""junk"" drawer to see what I can find... wish me luck.mgn"
4,Do They or Don't They,"Reading Barbara Sillery's THE HAUNTING OF LOUISIANA one is struck by the wealth of historical fact and details that leads to no conclusion. The illustrations bothered me as at times the author mentioned authentic photographs, but used Photoshopped mockups.A good read to add to a growning collection of documentaries of those who walk after death.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,great safety light,"I second the other two reviews, bright, good design, nice package.Down side is battery replacement. Doesn't bother me, but if you don't have a small screw driver/dexterity it could be a problem.Up side... hit a major pot hole on a down hill route causing the stap the light was on to break. The light survived the impact with out issue. (Benefit of the screws, I've had other lights, with out screws, come flying apart in similar circumstances.)So worth the money in my opinion."
1,"Difficult battery installation, poor QC","Wow, buying the Blackburn Mars 3.0 was a negative experience all the way around. First of all (and I'm definitely NOT a tree-hugging granola head), I was offended by the excessive packaging. It was very wasteful. And then only after I opened the package did I discover that installing the batteries required a tiny phillips screwdriver that many people won't have. Plus it was tedious to remove and replace the three tiny screws. It would have been more helpful if they put the battery installation instructions on the back of the excessive packaging. Then I found that the battery tray was too tight, requiring a lot of force to pop the batteries in. Then I discovered that the unit was broken. One LED lit up but the button didn't do anything. I'm glad it was broken because when I returned it I then discovered the Planet Bike Superflash, a fantastic little tail light that comes in very simple earth-friendly packaging."
3,it's a light...yes,"this light works great and is very bright. my only problem is the mount is not constructed well enough for me to go over bumps and not having it fall off. i'm on my second one, because i like the brand and the light but i'm going to be more careful when riding over bumps. the plastic clip broke, but i'm sure ifyou are creative enough you can figure a way to attach it better."
2,Beautifully bright light - bad design,"Like many others I think that the front of this light is wonderful... and the back of this light is terrible. It takes forever to change the batteries and the plastic clip on back is weak. I have returned home from a ride on two occasions to find that the light was no longer attached to my bike. If they could change these things, I would purchase another in a minute."
2,be ready to replace,"Ive had two of these and two died.... Dont leave them on your bike out in the elements... granted yes it was AZ sun, but my bike seat and brakes have lasted longer than not just one but TWO of these.... not only that you need a tiny screwdriver on hand to replace the battery."
3,Great visibility - poor attachment,"This light will make you visible; however, the clip seems prone to failure. I've lost 3 of these due to the clip breaking (twice on the seatpost clamp, once on a rack mount). In the first instance, I was traveling over a rough patch of asphalt. In the other two instances I was on smooth chip seal. The plastic seems too rigid and after enough cycles of road vibration, it eventually just gives out."
2,Worthless due to a poor clip,"Like many other reviewers, my clip snapped off after less than a month of light use. Keep in mind that I'm on a road bike commuting along mostly smooth roads. The light is great, but if it can't stay on the bike, it's just a nice shiny paperweight. I should have paid heed to the many warnings. You should do the same."
4,Bright Light w/ great customer service from Blackburn,"The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because yes, the screws to change the battery are kind of a hassle. Luckily, the light lasts fairly long - regular riding (for me, anyways) is about 3-5 miles/week as the sun goes down with this light on flashing mode - and so far I've had the light for 7 months w/o having to change the battery. I'd have to say however, that one day it just froze up on me. Despite taking the battery out/replacing it it wouldn't turn on. I emailed the folks at blackburn who got back to me within 2 days and are in the process of mailing me a new light! I'd definitely recommend this product because it does what I need it to do, is super bright, and is backed by great customer service. (BTW I have 2 and my first one has never given me any problems)"
5,This light rocks!,"I ride almost every day the temperature is above 10F in varied terrain, regardless of weather.This light is highly-visible and stays on, no matter what I do. It is rather tall, making it difficult to mount on a seatpost equipped with a seat bag. However, I just mounted it on the left seat-stay. The included batteries last an incredibly long time with a bright, strong light.When it comes time to move the light or change the batteries, it unclips easily. Usually a weak point, the battery cover is actually the whole back of the unit and must be unscrewed to remove. While it may seem inconvenient, you'll change batteries maybe every year or two. Also, battery doors usually jiggle loose, allowing water to get in or, even more fun, the batteries to escape.This little guy is a rock solid performer that is durable, long-lasting, super-bright, and well worth the investment."
3,"nice and bright, but fell off my bike... weak clip attachment","Was a great light for the 3 weeks I had it, it fell off at some point in my morning commute this am. I doubt I'll find it on the way home. be wary of attaching it via the clip to anything but the holster..."
3,OK but could be better,Nice bright light but the plastic bracket broke so I had to permanently attach the light to the bike. Also it would be nice if it used larger batteries so they wouldn't run down so fast.
2,"Poor battery life, hard to change batteries","It seems like I'm changing the batteries in this light every other month or so! I have several other bike lights that last much, much longer. To make it worse, it's really hard to open this light up to replace the batteries. I would not recommend this tail light - there are others out there that have comparable or better brightness/visibility factors and longer battery life."
2,i have not been killed since using this light,"this light is bright and has possibly kept me from being murdered by a car. neat! if not getting murdered by a car is important to you, consider buying this.update: less stars. while riding in the park yesterday, this light popped out of its bracket. while the light is nice and bright, its clip isn't sufficient to keep it attached to your bike."
2,Defective design,I strongly recommend you getting the Blackburn Mars 2.0 if you plan to permanently attach this light to your bicycle. The 2.0 uses a screw and thus will stay attached. My 3.0 fell off somewhere along my first ride as soon as it got a tad bumpy (in New York City).I had to buy a replacement light and thus settled for the 2.0. To this date it is still attached to my bicycle.
4,Durable Knights,"I bought this knight and horse for my son, 2, because he enjoys horses and knights. This is very durable, especially considering the abuse that my 2 and 3 year olds put it through. The knight is removable, and it helps my 2-year-old with hand-eye coordination to put him back in the saddle. The only drawback is the lance. It's removable, and that's a good thing if you want to keep the lance away from children. In the hands of 2-year-old, it's bendable, and the point is a weapon! Other than that, the knight and horse has offered endless fun!"
5,Wonderful details,Schleich makes the best toys and the figures have amazing detail and high quality. I purchase the figures for my 4 year old to teach him about medieval times and the details really make the explanation a great visual aid. My son plays with these figures everyday and I can honestly say the hold up to a great deal of abuse. I would highly recommend.
1,Don't buy this buy sailor moon season 1uncut. on DVD,"Don't buy this DIC took so many parts out of this tape. If you buy seasone uncut on DVD you will be able to see all of the parts that weren't taken out. I have this tape bur every since i got the DVD i got to see all the parts that were missing. The DVD has all orignal 46 episoeds and it is great. You get to see Ami, Minako. Rei, Makoto, and Usagi in there orignal selfs. So if you love Sailor Moon I would recomend buying the DVD boxset. The DVD is rated 15 and up and is not for little kids due to cursing, violence, and romance. So if you love sailor moon dont buy this dvd theres season1 uncut boxset alot better."
2,Extremely poor adaptation.,"I can't help but shake my head everytime I either see this episode, or look at this cassette. It makes no sense to me why they had to cut out so much; and since DiC's main concern was violence, why didn't they just remove the most violent scenes, and leave the rest in?We would have been left with the two episodes, and a much more emotional and dramatic ending to the series. Even DiC is pretty good at maintaining the emotion during the intense scenes, but they were either lazy, or not thinking straight.While they did do a good editing job (which is something I NEVER want to say), they really disappointed many Sailor Moon fans. I do find myself defending dubs, even Sailor Moon's dub whenever I come across otaku that constantly bash it, but even I will admit that DiC could have done a lot better..."
5,The best subwoofer cable I've ever used,"This is a very high-quality cable. Construction is solid, the audio quality is great, and the grounding cable is an excellent feature."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"The other review is right about Eastbay's ""customer service."" Not only did they manage to foul up a simple order, but they were incapable of rectifying the situation. Do yourself a big favor and DO NOT order from Eastbay."
1,Costomer Service Review,Service is extremely bad. Shipping and handling charges are excessive. Once an order is placed don't try to change it. Reps claim even the president of the Eastbay Company can't change an order. I will never again purchase from Eastbay. Tom Dillingham
5,Fantastic Christian CD,If youve ever heard Ron's Christian music and if you have not this cd is worth listening to!Praise Gods Children
3,Cry from Tiamat's ancient past...,"Given that this album returns to Tiamat's death metal past, ""Sumerian Cry"" is an apt name. A band that always has had been willing to experiment, Tiamat has jumped from the Floydesque psychedelia of ""Wild Honey"" to the grinding thunder and roaring death grunts that hard-core fans are sure to love, and that old school metal-heads, who have found that life is aggression enough, need a little more liqour to enjoy. The purists are probably happy, but the ancient kings of Ur and Edam are likely rolling in their graves."
2,Melts almost as quickly as the butter.,"Ok, it's a cheap turner. I get it.I am not expecting anything stunning here. We have two or three nylon turners, but not as large as this one.It has a really comfortable handle, otherwise this would be a 1-star.The edge melted with the first egg we cooked, and we're not using a blowtorch or anything super-hot. The ragged edge made using it for eggs challenging as they would stick. Pieces also fell off into our food. Trimming is required every couple of uses to cut the melted material off.Maybe that's why it is so big. They are giving you plenty of room so you can keep trimming the edge off."
4,Turns like a pro,"Not only is this a pancake turner, but it will turn DARN NEAR ANYTHING you put in a pan. Potatoes? Check. Chicken? Check. Vegetables? Check. French toast? Check. Scrambled eggs? Check. Does this thing get cleaned easily? Check. Would I buy it again? Check. Are you pumped up to buy this? Check."
5,like this,i was having issues with food falling off my old turners so i thought thats a nice large one. does a great job of holding pancakes and so many other foods like fries and fish sticks without dropping them back on the baking sheet or worse. the floor. it also doesnt require me to burn my fingers trying to pick the stuff back up since it doesnt fall off! well made worth the extra price for its bonuses. find myself using it daily along with my calphalan fork and oven mitts.
5,About John Barrowman Live at The Royal Albert Hall,"I Just received this DVD Yesterday ( 27 January 2012 ) And I Watched it last night ( 27 Jan 2012 ) and in John Barrowman's own words I can 1000 Percent say John Barrowman & special Guest Star Jodie Prenger's performance in this concert is FANTASTIC! FANTASTIC! FANTASTIC! and is a must have, for all fans of John Barrowman & Jodie Prenger! And there is also a cameo appearance by 2 very special people, But I am not going to give any spoilers here, You will have to buy this DVD and watch this awesome performance to discover for yourself!"
2,Bland example of minimal electronica.,"If you wish to explore the style of minimal/abstract/techno/dub electronica this is not the best choice. Although repetitive loops are inherent in the style, this release is too much of the same. Pleasant listening becomes annoying without variation. Small elements make a difference and this ain't it.I recommend any of the ""Click & Cuts"" compilations to get a great taste of glitch electronica."
5,Fragalaga lick my toenails clean,"Jesas kristy what a fwikin noss twip. Gawd amitty dis is da chjits.Wowa raze ma bluud pressers. Man da beleeve it Ide lake do gett to no did wrat.Yow, fekin unswedibable.Gablaza yo"
3,Too many citations,"This book could have been great... but they are way too many citations. If you are a college student or a graduate fresh out of school, trying to explore an other aspect of your career, look for a more in-depth book. One that will teach you the ropes, and give you a more down-to-earth, detailed approach. In brief, this book doesn't quite deliver for me."
1,Stay away from this turkey!!!!!!,"Purchased one in Feb, 2002 - since that time it has gone to 2 repair centers, in the last 7 weeks I have had 4 replacement ""refurbished"" copiers. None has been able to do more than ONE copy at a time. So much for their ""30 page automatic feed"". Canon will do nothing more than continue to send out another turkey with the same problem. With 9 months still left on the warranty, I am buying a Brother copier. No more Canon products for me!"
4,"Very useful book, explains a lot of new concepts","This book helps the reader to get a closer look at the paralegal career. It contains a lot if useful information, such as web links for the legal job search engines, addresses of the organizations, hints for the interview. Although it doesn't say a lot about distant education which becomes very popular these days, this book has a great guidelines for choosing the right school."
5,A black and white picture of obscure society corners,"I add this review above all as I disagree with a previous review from another reader. Comparing books, as he does, is a tricky and complex task. Thompson and Carlotto books are quite different under any aspect. Background, aims, means. Thompson and Carlotto are interested on focusing and bringing into light different aspects of crime. Some 50 more years have gone by between the two books. To advise re-reading Thompson in writing on Carlotto is as advising to re-read ""Crime and Punishment"" commenting on Thompson. Carlotto depicts a provocative and enlighting scenario of the post-70s european generation (non-UK, especially French, Italian, Spanish and German), of the 80s need of conformism and modern hypocrisy. The noir plot is, as in best writers (as Durenmatt), an excuse for bringing into light dark places of our societies."
1,The Goodbye Kiss,I tried some Italian authors and this book was included in that batch. This book was well written but totally without merit. It was bad from the beginning just to be bad and kept that up throughout. At the end the author tried to disown his bad attitudes but it was a waste of time to read.
3,Vicious,"It's a good thing this book is short. Its protagonist is a degenerate, a thief, a rapist, and a killer. The point seems to be to observe that in regard to his character the narrator is only as good or bad as his society (e.g., one of his cohorts is a bad cop). This is a bit of a stretch in my view, and I wasn't convinced by the hyperbole. It's admittedly difficult to follow in the footsteps of Jim Thompson's The Killer Inside Me. Better to read that for the first, or second, time."
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this after my old 300W blender burned out twice (they replaced it once). I expected that this one would last a lot longer especially with its 550W motor. Boy was I mistaken. After a dozen uses, the motor stopped working. No it didn't overheat and sieze; I used it, worked fine, put it in the cabinet and pulled it out a couple weeks later to make a breakfast shake. Nothing! Nada! Kaput! The motor doesn't even warm up, let alone spin. At least my cheapo blenders lasted a year (each) before they burned out. Pay 3 times the cost get 1/3 the lifetime. Way to go B&D, you can count on me buying more of you crappy blenders. Do not buy the BL5000!"
3,Good enough,"These look great stacked on a closet shelf, and are easy enough to access from the front. I found similar shoe boxes at The Container Store that seemed to be better quality, but they were about $14 each. At half the price, these are good enough for me."
2,Not what it looks like,"When I got it, it doesn't look like the picture. It is smaller (only 1 pair of shoes!). I returned it and moved forward."
2,hard to use,I was really looking forward to using these scissors for bandages. However after receiving them and trying to use them they are very hard to use. It is almost like they are not fitted together correctly. You almost need to use both harnds to open them.
4,They work,"I don't use scissors heavily, so for my light use, these work well. They are comfy enough and the orange colored handle is pretty cool. Price was nice, I would buy them again."
4,Great for wound care.,Great for having to do my sons daily wound care. Cuts through his dressing and tape perfectly. Fits my fat fingers fine!
1,Lord Nightingale's Christmas,"I am a lover of Victorian and Regency Romance especially when it takes place during the Christmas season. Unfortunately, Lord Nightingale's Christmas was the WORST book I have ever attempted to read and I say attempted because after working my way through about 80 pages, I couldn't even force myself to finish it.The author jumps all over the place and it is not easy to follow. There are about 10 storylines going on at the same time which makes the story unbelievably confusing. It's also quite dull and if there is a plot, you certainly can't find it. In her dialogue she indicates that you should probably have read her other 3 volumes first...NO WAY. You can read barely 3 pages of this book before beginning to yawn.Ms. Lansdowne would certainly benefit from taking writing lessons from people such as Edith Layton, Mary Balough and Jo Ann Ferguson to name a few."
3,I was there and this tells the story.,Jan has taken the reader into the cockpit with the Forward Air Controller. She has translated the various stories into a well organized history of what this mission was all about and tells the story of the pilots who flew at tree top level to direct airstrikes in Southeast Asia. It puts me back into my O-2 and I can re-live my experiences as a FAC all over again.
3,"Very scholarly, and in depth review of tactics and equipment","I know Jan Churchill, in fact bought an 0-1 birdog from her'wonderful airplane. She has put together an exhaustive, and accurate account of the development of Forward Air Control, Tactics, Equipment, Procedurees, and History. I was a Forward Air Controller in Vietnam, North and South, also flew in Laos with 324 missions total. She taught me many facets of the FAC business I did not know. I would consider her an expert in this field.,"
4,Very Good..However.,"I also purchased this one to work on my rental property.I generally happy with it,but once again,When I called Customer service for my blower,they sent it to a place to get it serviced under company policy and I discovered the service company doesnt accept Ryobi.Once again.Why?Plus the throddle get in the way a little which can be annoying.But it blowers very fast and is light weight.But Ryobi you can do better.So,When you buy this you still get a Good blower,but hope nothing goes wrong with it."
4,Perfect,"My son wanted one thing for Christmas, a dinosaur. This one was perfect. The size, softeness and cuddle ability. He was the happiest little boy Christmas morning."
3,Han's not as cool as we thought,"This book, though midly entertaining, is not for the old school Star Wars fans that grew up on the original Trilogy. The Han Solo Trilogy lacks the stories of a scoundrel that I expected not to mention creates a love sick sucker out of everyone's unlikely hero. This trilogy also has glaring contradictions and plot holes when taken with the movies and other Star Wars books. This book is for the younger Star Wars fan, the generation that believes Greedo shot first."
3,Weak at best!,"Ok Imagine Han Solo of all people in spandex doing magic shows. Enough said, but I will say more. Boba Fett shows up and loses most of the time. He even shows up at the end to tell Han some bad news out of the goodness of his own heart. Chewie gets married and has a kid and leaves both for honor in this series. Honor my arse! The whole time I kept thinking who let this woman mangle this book. Solo even takes kids with him on a run to deliver drugs."
2,not the best in the trilogy,"the book pretty much just sucked.the first two books were pretty good though.it was ok when i started raeding it,but the plot just got worse and worse.probably one of stupidest things about it was the battle for ylesia,i mean it was so unorganized.and what's up this ##!%!!! about han solo and sala zend.avoid this book."
4,Hmm...,"A.C. Crispin is an obviously talented author. It was a spell-binding, interesting book. It lacked a little in accuracy, though. Besides that, I would say that the Han Solo Trilogy was one of the best SW series."
4,Best in the trilogy!,"Books one and two were good, but this final installment of the trilogy is definitely it's crowning glory. Before this series, I never thought of Han as being deep, or even really that interesting, but from the moment I began the series, I was as engrossed in his early life as if it were mine. This one in particuler drew me into his character, though without compromising the flow of the plot, or the heartstopping action sequences. Anyway, this book spans over a longer time period as well, (five years?) taking us all the way to the moment he enters the Mos Eisley cantina in A New Hope. As for the plot, I can't bring myself to spoil it for you, and if you've read the first two, this one is a must. Any Star Wars fan would love this series."
3,In perfect harmony with the story of Han Solo...,"If Your a true Star Wars junkie you'll love this book as a compiled work of 8 books! A.C. Crispin did a wonderful job of keeping the universe in perfect harmony. To salvage anything of value from the (look I'm a Sci-fi author) Lando trilogy is a plus. The middle of the book gives even the main character Han some time gaps for his corporate sector adventures. The plot does get real slow during the tie-ins and reads more like a history book than an action story. The ""Big Battle Scene"" is short and predictable but very accurate as to the start of the Rebellion and the all to famous Greedo scene!"
4,Best of the Trilogy,"This is the best of the Han Solo Trilogy. It ties in well with other books concerning the time period, and it does a good job of fleshing out the fledgling Rebel Alliance before Luke and Leia join, developing Boba Fett,the Hutts gang war, and has a satisfying conclusion to the Yelasia story. It also does a supurb build up to either New Hope, or the Tales of the Mos Eisely Cantina."
4,The Han Trilogy ends at the beginning......,"""Rebel Dawn"" book 3 of ""The Han Solo"" trilogy by A. C. Crispen.After a victory for the smugglers against the Empire Han is without a Ship, but not to worry he found out about a High stakes game of Sabbac taking place at cloud city and found a ship that needed to be piloted there. With a little luck Han figures that he may win enough credit's to buy a new ship.....wait a second Lando has entered the tournament and Han isn't sure if he can compete with a pro gambler like lando.......The Good: more good first, the start of the Rebel alliance and Han had a hand in it's formation in a way, Han acquires a certain ship, Hutts and the Kessel Run and......""Even I get boarded some times."" The last page of this book will have you pulling out your copies of the original trilogy.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: A great end to a great trilogy. Highly recommended to all Star Wars fans. This book ends at a perfect spot."
4,Solid if unspectacular finish to a well-written trilogy!,"Picking up directly after the Hutt Gambit, Rebel Dawn suffers in comparison to its well-written predecessors. The book is much more predictable and the return of characters followed throughout the trilogy is a give. Bria, Han's love from the first book is reunited with the scruffy smuggler, only to betray him for the Rebel Alliance. Han loses all his friends except Chewie, but in the meantime is able to make the fastest Kessel Run ever, loses spice from Jabba and generally gets set up for plot points that take place in the classic trilogy. Although it is an above average Star Wars book, Rebel Dawn is a bit of a letdown after the previous 2 books, but is still an adequate conclusion to the Han Solo trilogy."
1,SW Conspiracies: The Bria Theory,"There is little or nothing good to say about this dismal ending to what was at the beginning a promising trilogy. The writing is choppy, the stopgap narration agitating, and Crispin's attempt to smoothly insert Bria, her original character, at the very center of the SW universe (you thought it was Mon Mothma and company who formed the Rebellion? HA!) not only fails miserably, but smacks of Mary Sue-ism of the worst kind. Unless you're a die-hard SW fan, save your money for *I, Jedi*, which is coming out next month."
4,Nice finish (beginning?),"Crispin does a nice job writing about the early exploits of our favorite Star Wars character, as well as other well known and new faces in the Universe. It is also interesting how she fits it all in with Brian Daley's version of Han's earlier Corporate Sector/Tion Hegemony adventures. Overall, a very nice lead up to the Star Wars Trilogy we all know and love. P.S. Keep an eye out for Dash Rendar's cameo. It's sort of neat how she ties him as well as Prince Xizor and Guri into all this!"
4,Best Star wars trilogy!,"This Trilogy is wonderfull. It concentrates on Han Solo's life from 17 years old to his first appearence in the movie, skipping 5 years between each book. Almost all of the information is accurate, tying in how he met Chewbacca and Han Solo: At Star's End."
3,Rebel Dawn,This book was not nearly as exciting as the previous two. I felt like the author was just trying to tie to different stories together.
2,Poor design,"This desk unfortunately does not serve its design purpose very well. The monitor stand was not sturdy enough to support a large monitor. The pullout keyboard stand would frequently stick. The computer tower stand also was not very sturdy and did not support the weight of the tower well. The bar across the back of the desk was at the same level as the plug input for the computer tower, and thus it blocked the plug. This meant the tower had to be pushed out to an awkward position in front of the desk. Overall, this was a poor design."
4,pretty well done,This is when Serena's friends at her middle school go on a normal class field trip. Suddently they get caught in a trap by the negaverse and the sailor scouts have to think of something quick in order to save their classmates from getting their energy sucked away.
2,Ouch!,"Although I love the fit of this bra, the underwire snapped in half in well under 1 year of use."
2,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?,I WAS SOLICITED BY THE SELLER AND READ THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS AND THEN READ THE BOOOK! IT WAS INTERESTING AND HAD NEW INFORMATION BUT WHO WOULD WANT TO GO THERE CONSIDERING THE DEFEATIST PHILOSOPHY OF THE PLACE AND THE APPARENT ACCEPTANCE OF KILLING? IN GENERAL IT WAS A BUST. D
4,"Near perfection as a product, poor value for money","the product is useful, but the price point seemed about 25-35% to high. It is not often that a person will need this but with a lower pricepoint they might want this."
3,fair but incomplete,I bought every title in this series except 'mens' and 'couture' because the price was right. Each contains a synopsis of each of the designers shows as listed. Good for archival storage since the DVD quality is good. But where is Alexander McQueen? He does not appear in ANY of the six or seven discs I viewed. Wasn't he an important player? Or is Big Brother rewriting history again? What a shame.
5,PD-F908 101 CD CHANGER,I HAVE TWO OF THESE. THE FIRST PLAYER HAS BEEN A WORK HORSE FOR MANY YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS. I PURCHSED THE SECOND PLAYER AS A BACKUP AND IT WORKS EXCELLENT. IT IS QUIET WHEN MOVING THE CD. THE VOLUME IS GREAT WITH THIS UNIT ATTACHED TO A PIONEER AMP. YOU CAN CRANK THE AMP UP WITH NO DISTORTION. VERY RELIABLE AND GOOD FOR YEARS OF USE.DEAN
1,I didn't have time for this...,"After reading all the bad reviews of the Sony ""carousels"" and the good reviews of the Pioneer, I went with this. Fresh out of the box, the front door hung up. Just thought you all should know both sides."
4,Good purchase,"This is my second Blackburn Delphi 5.0 Bicycle Cyclometer. I liked so much the first one which I purchased in summer 2006 that I got a second one. So far it has been easy to install, to use, and has been reliable. My only critique would be that the part that goes on the spoke could be improved, so that it would be more solid."
4,Nice cyclometer,"The Delphi 5.0 is an excellent overall cyclocomputer. I found that the heart rate monitor functions more reliably that the Polar that I replaced, and the cadence function is a nice addition (although the cord to the cadence sensor takes some pursuasion to string it to its destination on the chain stay). The indicator is VERY easy to read, and has plenty of functionality. I've used mine for about a year and have been quite pleased."
4,Lots of bang for 80 bucks,"Very nice product. Everything works as advertised, including the well-documented spikes in maximum heartrate--the filtering function works sporadically. Still, this is everything you could want--unless you REALLY want an altimeter. I don't find the wire for the cadence monitor too irritating, but I used an extra 5 zip-ties to keep it out of the way of everything. I LOVE this product."
4,Happy with Product,"This is a labeler. There's not much to say, haha. It works pretty well--there aren't many limitations. It prints all Brother TZ tapes from 9/64"" to 1."" I order all of my tapes from ECOM Office Supplies (http://www.ecomofficesupplies.com/ProductInfo~productid~BRT-PT2710.html). ECOM is the cheapest I found after an extensive search. They provide decent service, too, including a Rolodex card with my shipment.It has a few different display modes for the screen. It maintains a particular mode even after being turned off then on. Since I have it hooked up to my computer, I always leave it on the time & date. It does have an automatic shutoff function, whether plugged in or on batteries.Last, something to note is that it does have printer margins just like a regular printer. This will not print borderless labels."
3,An American who was there,"Having lived in Panama during the Noriega dictatorship, I am an avid reader of books covering this particular period of Panamanian history. While I found Kevin Buckley's book to be generally well written, it tries to cover too much ground in too little space, providing readers with an abbreviated account of major events during the rule of strong men Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega. For a more in-depth perspective on Panamanian history, I found that using the names of these two dictators as key words in my search resulted in a better selection of books."
4,Well-rounded Introduction to Topic,"Very useful, readable account of the events surrounding the invasion, and vivid details of another example of the age-old American policy of overthrowing foriegn regimes.Often critical but never overtly opinionated, Buckley's best section relates to the failed U.S.-backed coup and its tragic aftermath."
2,"Good foundation for mirco econ textbook, but poorly executed","This book has the potential for being a good textbook, but there are endless amounts of spelling and grammar issues, which shouldn't show up in a college textbook, the examples are hard to follow at times. I ended up googling concepts the majority of the time instead of reading the book for my class, and ended up with an A anyway. If you can, it may be better to skip the textbook and use google for your class."
1,Wrong Item,I ordered the Microeconomics 7th edition book and the seller sent me the 4th edition of the book. I needed to have correct book for my class and and also the shipping company used was late on my order after I purchased one day shipping. I will no longer be purchasing anything from this seller and questioning purchasing anything further from amazon.
2,less than I expected,"For a little more money I would have received the whole student support package including the CD ROM, the book was in good shape but other sites include more infomation when you purchase."
2,This hat is not the one pictured...,"I ordered this because I wanted a Gamecock baseball hat but the one sent did not have the ""SC"" logo; it looked like this one instead:Top of the World South Carolina Gamecocks Garnet Triple Conference Adjustable HatIt is a good hat but just not the one pictured, therefore, not the one I expected to get."
1,Will never buy Epson again!,"This is my 4th Epson and you would think I would have learned my lesson by now. Each newer model is more unreliable than the previous. I used to be able to get a few good years of serice from an Epson. With the R300, I barely got 1 year of service before the print quality started going down hill. After doing several ""head cleaning"" cycles, it got even worse. To service it at this point will be as expensive as buying new and it is no longer under warranty...thanks for nothing Epson! I gave up on color. Bought a Brother laser printer, and have never been happier!"
5,Epson R300M,"This printer was rated the best of every photo printer in an Office Depot store, by one eventual buyer. He tried them all. The Canon 900 was a distant second. Other than the superb quality of the prints, the amazing thing is that it will take a CD driver, so you can print from your CDs. It will also burn the pics in your camera card to a CD. What talent!I sold a HP Photosmart 7550, when I got this one. The R300 is the basic printer. If you buy the R300M, it includes a plug-in LCD viewer. The viewer is pretty important, in my judgement, for photo printing."
1,Junk,I bought this unit to print to CD's and figured that the ability to print photos would be an bonus. After about 50 photo's the photo part died. Yellow just won't print properly no matter how many times I calibrate it. After about 150 cd's the tray just wont move. I will never buy epson again.
1,frustrated and annoyed,"At first I liked the printer... then it completely STOPPED PRINTING CDs/DVDs. And not to mention, every time I print a page of any size, (4x6, 8.5X11, etc.) it prints the CORNERS BLACK. So not only do I have black corners on all the photos/papers I printed out. I can't even print on media anymore."
3,problem with the power on button.,Printer works fine if you leave it on. Getting it powered on is a problem. There appears to be a short of some kind in the switch. Printer works fine for the purpose it was purchased.
1,Ink Sucking Box on my Desk,"Prints great and is quiet. Sucks ink like a hungry baby on a bottle.20 8""x10"" prints = $100+ in ink. Epson would give this printer away for free, but they're smart enough to know that buyers would suspect a catch. I know - charge the buyer for the printer AND continually drain there wallets in ink expenses.Epson doesn't make money on printers- they make money on repeat sales of ink. To make more money on ink they make a printer that blows through it. A WIN-WIN for Epson! Hoo-ray Epson!Oh....but like I said, it does print nice...but should't it anyway?"
3,RGB instead of CMYK!?!,"I bought this printer to replace my epson 1270 and it was a definite improvement. Extreme quite, even better photo quality, but that's the catch. It can only print RGB files, my CMYK turns out truely horrible. 600 dpi looks like really low res web pics. And yes, I double checked all the trouble shoots. Has anyone else had this problem?"
5,Great Photo Printer,I used a Lexmark printer until it finally died and replaced it with a the epson 6 ink tank printer which I found to have much better print quality and ink use has been great. I have printed over 200 4x6 borderless prints and less than half the ink in the color carts is gone. I also use the best settings for printing. highly recommend this printer for amature and professional photographers. the prints are photo lab quality for a fraction of the cost. It seems to work great for scrapbooking as well.
4,Great printer but...,"If you don't need the card readers or pictbridge, buy the R200 instead. It has exactly the same print engine and software as the R300 but at half the price! I checked the specs at Epson and they're the same. On the Canon printers you have to go to the i960 to find a six color printer for the same price as the R300 and still not get the card readers on the R300. All of these are excellent printers but I think the Epson dye printers have a slight edge over the Canon in print permanence based on the statistics that I've been comparing."
2,Nothing but problems,"This is the second Epson printer that I've had and the second time I've been unhappy. However, the printer often has trouble with just basic printing. The paper doesn't feed right or gets jammed, picture paper and CDs must be placed just right or they are completely messed up (the CD tray stopped it's auto-load after 3 prints.)It sounds great to have the multiple cartridge option, and in practice it *almost* works well - I only replace what I need. However, if you don't have the color you need and you run out, beware that the software prevents you from printing in straight black. Instead of a print, you get constant ""buy ink now"" messages.I will not buy Epson again."
3,Finally a Good one,"My wife and i bought this printer becuase she likes to print all the digital pictures she takes, and this printer has the slots for the media cards. We actually went through three printers before we got one that worked right. The other printers the removable media slots kept connecting and disconnecting randomly. The software was install correctly, we brought two of them back and finally got one that works. Now that we have a working printer, it is great. One big draw back if just one of the ink tanks is empty the printer will not print, i thought that was odd. Very easy to use and set up and the media slots now that they work are very nice, we don't even have to dock the camera anymore just put the card in the computer and use the photo software that came with the printer to change the pictures on the computer. Great buy."
4,? about the cd printer,"I just bought the printer a few weeks ago. I bought it for the Cd disc printing. They look great. The instructions say you have to use printable cd's only. I was wondering has anyone tried to print a cd label on a regular cd, and if so, how was the outcome? I know they say not to use a un-printable cd, but will it distroy the printer if you do? Will the ink just run off the regular cd surface? I like the printer, photo's look great, but i do feel it is slow at printing the job."
2,Pointless inkjet technology!! This printer sucks!!,"Don't be fooled by the ""six-color separate ink cartridge"" baloney. Epson does not let you print if one of the cartridges is low. I mean what's the point? I replaced the black cartridge and then wanted to do a nozzle check, but it wouldn't let me because the light magenta cartridge was low, so I had to wind up replacing that one as well--then the cyan cartridge wasn't full enough--I ended up replacing four of the six cartridges just to do a nozzle check print!! I am so sick and tired of this crap!! Epson is in the business of selling ink not printers! It's a worthless piece of junk!!"
3,great photo print out but not the best,"I have own both R300 and i960, I compared both photo print out and i could clearly see the difference especially the big droplets on the R300 print out. If you want the sharpest picture quality go with Canon because their printers do 2 picoliter droplets."
4,Nice Personal Photo Printer,"I've had this printer for 3 years and it prints pictures beatifully. I use it at home for my personal picture printing only. The color is just as it appears on the computer screen and images are vivid. I have used replacement cartridges and have only had trouble with the black ink. The ink does run out quickly as the cartridges are small but the compatible ones have worked well except for the black. I have not had trouble with paper feeding and use several sheets at a time. One will need to experiment with the settings for different computers but the end results are georgeous. I like my home printed pictures better than ones done by print shops. I've been told that some of my printed pictures look like postcards and I agree.After reading other reviews, I might be a little wary about this product, but it has performed nicely for me."
1,This printer makes me angry,"I have never been more frustrated with a printer than this Epson R300 Inkjet Printer. It struggles to grab paper and takes about half an hour to finally load one sheet and print. Printing is a nightmare. If I'm on a tight deadline, I'd rather hand-write an essay than waste time waiting hours for the printer to cooperate."
2,Won't print if ANY of the colors are out,"I really liked my printer, until I have been trying to print with just black ink, because I knew a few colors were out...well, it won't let me print in even just Black ink (which I have almost a full cartridge) because one or more of the colored cartridges are empty. So, if you want to spend a fortune in ink...buy this printer....because all it does is suck my ink. I am looking for a new printer, because I am dissapointed in this printer. Also, the photo printing is difficult to use. You have to be a computer guru to get it to print out 4x6 photos correctly."
1,zero stars,"I hate this printer. I wasted my money. Having 6 ink cartridges is a nightmare as it will not print if you are out of ANY of the cartridges. Even if you tell it to print black ink only, and light magenta happens to be out, it will not print anything. It is slow to print. It uses a strange TSR on your windows computer. It alerts you too much before just printing. Who wants to configure a hundred things just to print something? DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
3,Ink Hog,This printer WILL NOT WORK if any of the color cartridges are empty. Even if color is turned off.
2,new technology in 1900,"Mrs. olsen must have been a little girl once. This is a cute little story about a young girl who wants her family to own the new invention , the telephone. Cute colorful illustrations with the 1900 looks in dress and home. I like that. 1900 house !see what drives daddy to decide if he should buy a fad or not .Could be a good look into envy and coveting."
1,Unreadable,"Due to the lack of contrast on the face, this watch is virtually unreadable.Received as a gift and wanted to love it, but couldn't stand it.If, like me, you wear a watch to know the time, this is not the best choice.Look for the version with the black face.Accuracy and mechanics aside, if you can't read it what good is it?"
2,He is great but the book is mediocre,"For Ron White fans, there is nothing new in this book. In fact the 304 pages are half cartoons -- which are somewhat funny but takes away from the real subject -- Ron White. I'm a huge fan of Ron White but this book was actually boring in spots. If you have seen him on TV or DVD - then you've seen the best he has to offer. I'll buy his next DVD but an author he is not. Nice try Ron but this one came up short."
1,Disappointing!,"I like Ron White - on TV. However, his book ""I Had the Right to Remain Silent"" just doesn't come off the same way as he does on TV. The book consists of various stories, all fairly lame when read. Perhaps the material would be much better live."
2,Just a transcript of his television specials...,"Just a transcript on his television specials, But that's okay; 'cause now when I watch him on CMT for the hundredth time, I can read along with Ron...."
2,Disappointed,"I really like Ron White - he's a scathingly funny storyteller, so when I bought this book I had hoped to learn more about the man, not the comedian.All the book is is his comedy routines in written form. Not nearly as funny when you read it as when you are watching him perform. I know his routines so well that I can imagine him telling the stories with all of his facial expressions and gestures, but it's just not the same.Sad to say it's not worth the money I spent - can you give a Kindle book back for a refund?? I'd have been better ff buying the Tater Salad DVD."
3,Some things are better left unsaid,"While I am a big Ron White fan, this book could have been better. It goes on a back and forth patteren of a chapter of his routine followed by a chapter of his life, etc etc, mixed in with illistrations to help drive home the point of the punch line. If you have heard Ron's stand-up from Drunk In Public and You Can't Fix Stupid, you will haev covered about 85-90% of the stand-up material in the book. The bio portion of it leaves more to be desired. It was a good buy for $5, but I couldn't recomened spending more than that on the book."
2,Not what I was looking for in this book.,"Very fast and easy read. However, it was not what I was looking for in this book. It is comprised mostly of Ron's stage material with a few intimate life details. I was looking for more life details past, present, and future of Ron's life. All in all good read for folks not famaliar with his stand up routine."
4,Great headphones for air travel,"I do quite a bit of flying, and these have been a real boon. Much less expensive - especially since I bought a refurbished pair - and smaller and more portable than the Bose headphones. These have made it much easier to enjoy my iPod inflight - I only wish I didn't have to turn it off for takeoff and landing."
4,Good price for getting into noise cancelling headphones,After flying over 40 hrs (50+ if you include layovers) I have to say that these headphones were worth it.Things I liked:1. Compact design - easy to pack and store in the seat pocket2. Comfortable - no issues falling asleep with them onThings that could be better:1. Better cord managment - not a biggie but having both cords come out of the same end of the cancelling unit could be improvedThis is my first pair of noise cancelling earphones so I don't really have anything to compare them to. However I think the refurbs are a good value buy and I don't plan on upgrading anytime soon.
2,"Good Concept, Poor Quality","The noise reduction feature is great on airplanes, but I've grown to dislike these headphones. After 3 months, I'm getting static in the left earpiece and the battery holder makes static in both phones when you move it (loose connections?). Nobody services these in Detroit. Also the battery holder is always getting tangled in the cords which is annoying. I'd recommend Noise-Cancelling headphones, just not these. I'm looking at the Sony NC6's as my next pair."
3,"Great as a noise-canceller, less reliable as headphones","The noise-canceling on these headphones is great (although take that with a grain of salt, as this is my first pair of noise-canceling headphones). I depended on these headphones on flights to Europe and India (10+ hours in the plane) involving crying kids and a fair bit of noise overall. It was amazing to hear the difference whenever I turned off the noise-canceling.However, the headphones were not as good for actually hearing audio through. For one, the minimum volume was often too high (I literally had to yank out the headphone jack when I checked the flight status display on the in-seat screen, as the default music was at mind-melting levels). Also, the jack (or perhaps some of the wiring) was not 100% stable, and music would cut of or (worse) assume a digital, distant sound as if it was passing through Darth Vader's helmet."
3,not what I expected,"It comes with a pen sized attachment that takes batteries and when you turn it on there is white noise that runs below your music. I can't listen very long it bothers me. But it does block out noises in the room, I have been using as ear covers while I run a chop saw, lol. I wish I had been able to try them in a store."
4,A Great Escape,"I bought these headphones not knowing really what to expect with the noise-cancelling capabilities. As soon as I used them while traveling on a plane I understood what all the rave was about. These work great! They are light weight and do not pinch your ears. The noise-cancelling truly does knock out the humming noises of the plane and it has excellent sound for listening to music, etc... I never knew that the airline entertainment system could sound so good. The only thing that was a little tricky to figure out was folding and unfolding the headphones but once you do it a couple times it's easy."
2,Does not block airplane noise,"If you just want a nice sounding pair of headphones, buy these, but if you are looking for something to knock down the airplane noise, look elsewhere. They just dont get the job done. Not even close."
2,Hiss can be a problem for some people,"We wanted them for airplane travle but I just returned them for two reasons.The female members of my family (who must have outstanding hearing) complained about a very distracting hiss when the noise reduction was on. I (as many people) was unable to hear that frequency, but my wife had also tried the Bose ones in a store and they did not have this problem. So it must be a Sennheiser specific issue where they were gambling on most people not being able to hear that hiss.The other reason why I finally returned my pair too was the fact that the noise reduction simply wasn't that great. We were also trying the tinyEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones (Black)which go directly into your ear (like a plug) and they did a much better job of blocking out unwanted noise. They are super small and only cost about half of what the Sennheiser headphones are going for. So it was an easy decision for us. 3 x Etymotic ER6i for our flight to Europe."
4,"works, print server is slow","yes, it's a router. the print server is very slow, don't expect hp jetdirect performance, maybe 1/3 the throughput."
5,SMC X 3,"Bought the 7004 ABR when an ISP promised that they would supply a broadband connection. Well that was 18 months ago and it didn't happen. Just got cable so I hook-up the router, it came out of the box DOA. Called customer support they shipped out a new one...although I purchased it 18 months prior the replacement was ""no-charge"". Customer support was easy to contact. The replacement router with print server work great. Nice doing business with companies that stand behind their products."
4,Great Little Router,"I choose the SMC over other routers for several reasons:1) The reviews here and elsewhere had relatively nice things to say about SMC's tech support. My own experience with Netgear's support has been mixed and dreadful with Linksys.2) Uses Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI): this presumably provides a higher level of firewall protection.3) Price was great.Installation proceeded with a minor hang: received an error message that informed me that the router address did not match the expected IP address.Resetting the power did not help, so I went to the browser configuration page, keyed in the computer's network name and address. It has been up and working ever since!"
3,NO customer service,"I purchased this router because of the price, printer port and it's ability to packet filter. The unit stopped routing after two days. SMC's customer support is non-existent. You have to email them and they take five days to respond. And when they do respond, they paste things from the manual in the letter. Good thing I bought it from Amazon...they are replacing the unit.Don't buy this if you can't fix it yourself."
2,Worked great ... for a while,"I purchased the SMC 7004ABR router in December and used it for 6 or 7 months until it decided it no longer wanted to hold the connection. The email to customer service resulted in long delays in replies, and responses that did not make sense. Its a shame since it is a good product when it works and the print server feature is nice. Hoping to get it to work, otherwise Linksys here I come."
5,Great product. It does what it claims.,Great product.If i had to buy another product i would look for one made by SMC.Easy to set up and great speed. Does slow done the internet connection a little bit because of the firewall.If you are going to use the print server make sure you visit your printer manufactors web site and download new drivers. I had a canon printer and tried to install the drivers that came with the printer but they wont work. I than visited canons website and downloaded the smaller (min.) drivers and the print server worked fine.
