5,This was a gift...,"And she loves it! She wanted the bottle (whoops), but still uses it all the time. Convenient to have with her at work."
3,I prefer a larger size,"I love the Brita system. It's just as good as bottled water, much less expensive and, of course, much better for the environment. The only issue I have with this model is its size. I drink a lot of water, and there is a larger size Brita pitcher, which is far more convenient for me. If you drink a lot of water, you may be more pleased with the larger size, as you don't have to refill it nearly as much."
3,not what I was hoping for,"This was much more bulky than I anticipated, and I would not have bought it, if I had known that before hand."
4,great product,Great product....filters water as described.....would buy this product again. I live in a swamp area with dirty water and I trust this product.
5,Excellent water filter!,"Excellent water filter! Does exactly what I purchased it for, which is remove the disgusting taste from the water of Afghanistan. Highly recommended!"
5,What I needed,I already have a brita pitcher but my brother loves it so I purchased him one for christmas. I know he will like it as much as I like mines.
3,Oops!,"The lid, omg, it just fell off as I was pouring a glass. And, wait, there's more to this ...the well along with the filter too! I was just glad that the whole thing did not break. Now for the good stuff...Love the shape. Fits nicely in small spaces in refrigerator and on counter top. It's nice not having to lug home gallons of water from the supermarket. I absolutely will not drink faucet water, so I'm trying to get used to drinking filtered faucet water. Don't know why sometimes the taste isn't always that great. Still has some hint of faucet water. That's when I get turned off by this whole pitcher thing and want to go back to bottled water. But I'm saving lots of money that I can use for other expenses. Yes, I like the savings advantage."
3,Poor design. water leaks from the lid,poor design of bottle.it needs extra care for carring this bottle.water leaks from the loose lid. you need to hold it before pouring.
4,Beautiful Brita,"This pitcher is a good size, it has not leaked thus far and the top seems to stay on alright, overall good purchase"
4,not family size,"I like this pitcher and the water taste good after filtered. This is a cool design and looks good on the counter, but it is probably not a good size for a family, unless you don't mind filling it after every 2-3 glasses being filled. Good for 1 or 2 people in a household."
5,"Looks Great, Works Well","This Pitcher arrived in about 4 days with standard shipping. It was easy to assemble and in good condition. More than functional, the water tastes great in it. It seems to be to be a great buy."
3,Best Brita yet,This is the third Brita pitcher that I've had. It's sleek and fits easily in my refrigerator (the last one took up way too much room). The product came quicker than expected and the price was perfect.
2,Decent but pricey,"Greetings! How much can you say about this product? It's a water filter pitcher combo made of cheap plastic. The container is flimsy and could easily shatter if dropped on a wood or tile floor; be careful with the lids that open and close, as the hinges are thin plastic and easily snap off. We've always enjoyed Brita water for the convenience and improvement on the nasty taste of tap water, but these pitchers are garbage."
2,"Slim design, but poor-fitting lid","This pitcher fits nicely in the door of my refrigerator which is great! However, the lid falls off every time I use it. Not sometimes, EVERY time. I know it's going to fall off so I make every effort to place my thumb on it while I pour, but no matter how hard I try, it falls off and onto the counter/floor. I don't understand how any industrial designer could feel proud of this pitcher.I'm giving it two stars because the water tastes great, fits well in the refrigerator and looks nice when set out for use but try to find one with a lid that doesn't crash to the floor whenever you pour yourself a glass.."
3,Much improved,"I like this pitcher more than our previous model, but do wish that they would make a pitcher that has a top that either has a latch of some type or fits much more firmly. The size of the pitcher does fit better in our refrigerator."
4,Good Brita product after a bad one,I previously reviewed here the Brita 42364 SpaceSaver Pitcher. It had a problem with a lid that would not stay on. We stayed with that pitcher for two months to see if it was tolerable. Nope. We ended up retiring the bad one to the garage to pour random liquids. This one does what we need...and the lid stays on. The one feature the bad pitcher has that this one does not is the filter replacement dial reminder in the lid. This pitcher has a plastic sticker like the oil change reminder they stick on the inside of your car windshield. Kind of makes you wonder what goes on inside the product design world at Brita. Sort of random.
3,Fetch a pail of wata,"The Brita system does indeed work to a degree, but is definitely worth the time to improve your tap water quality... The gripe I have is with the design of the pour spout.... Don't expect the flow of water from this thing to behave the same way twice. I know most people would be pouring your water into a cup, but I use a jug for large supplies so I don't have to filter so frequently. The diameter of the mouth of the container I use in about 2inches, and even pouring as slow as I can, quite often does the stream of water exceed this boundary causing inconvenient spillage... other than that it's a decent product."
4,great for 1 or 2 people,I have to fill it three/four times a day for 2 people-- couldn't imagine using it for a family. It takes a few minutes to fill but that's no big deal. You might find tiny black particles floating in the pan but they don't filter into the drinking water. It fits into the door of my fridge which I like. The water taste great and for the money it was a great buy.
5,gud 1,"very good pitcher for 1 or 2 people, cleans water, worth for the price it comes in, would recommend to all"
1,Product bent after wash,"I replaced my old Brita pitcher with this new one. When I opened the package the top was hard to fit and close, but it was usable. Now, after a week of usage, I placed it in the dishwasher and when it came out, the pitcher was bent in such a way that the filter holder was very hard to fit into the pitcher, and the top cover does not fit at all.Amazing how the plastic is so weak that it can't stand the heat whereas the plastic of the old pitcher was hard and lasted over 10 years."
1,Received broken merchandise,I received a broken Slim Linr Pitcher which I returned some time ago along with my invoice. Have not heard anything about this. Will stick to Wal-Mart shopping.
5,"the first time to use a brita, the best choice ever !","i drink water a lot everyday. As a college freshman, i have spent lots of money to buy bottles of water this quarter. So, i decided to get a Brita. I wanted to get a big and slim one in order to store pretty much amount of water into refrigerator. When I got this Brita today, I was so impressed by its size, design, and function. The water as expected tastes like spring/mineral water, never tastes it as tap water. I feel it was the best choice to get a great Brita, neither too cheap one nor too expensive one."
4,Not bad ...,"I'm a recent college graduate and am living on my own, so the pitcher's just right for me. I wouldn't recommend it for a big household as the pitcher only logically holds half a gallon or so at a time."
3,If u drink much water per day you'll be filling this multiple times per day...,"other than that just ok. Have owned 4 other Brita pictures in the past. This one is kinda small if u drink much water from it. Overall not displeased. Looks good and has good ergonomics, compact and what's not to like about Blue color when it comes to drinking water. If u drink much water from a Brita pitcher go with something bigger, especially if 2 or more drink water frequently from it."
2,two big flaws,"We broke our trusty old pitcher after several years. We got this at a local store and liked the space saving concept. However, there are 2 flaws that had we known, would have caused us to change our decision. First, as mentioned by others, the lid does not fit well at all. Yes is snaps if, if you get it just right. But getting it right after it falls off requires more effort than a product like this should. Second, if you pick this pitcher up right after you fill it and do not hold it PERFECTLY level, water will fill the hollow handle and then dribble everywhere. Poor design for a simple product."
1,Don't bother with this model,We have several Brita products and recently purchased this model because it would fit into our trailer's refrigerator. Several of our friends have purchased the same pitcher. Non of us would recommend this product because the top/lid is not secured very well. It is a flawed design. The top pops off every time we pour [with water gushing out everywhere]. The design is such that the top does not securely snap in place and hold to the body.
2,"Filtration good, cover horrible","The cover for this pitcher is horrible. When you try to pour it falls off, water spills everywhere and if you lift up the pitcher, the cover falls off. I personally don't like our town water which is why we got this product. The water does taste better but the cover makes it so painful to use."
4,My second Brita,"This is my second Brita, I purchased the first one, 3 years back and had to give it away as I had to move out of country.I purchased the second one now, and as always, this thing works like charm.The only complaint I have is the black stuff that comes out sometimes in the compartment where you fill the water. However, the best part is these black substances don't go in the filtered water that you drink.I researched a lot before buying this second BRITA and finally ended up buying brita again."
3,Weak,Overall an OK product. But the little lift-up lid broke off despite my caring for the item. And the filter lets too much of that black filtration material through.EDIT: Got tired of both issues mentioned above so I purchased the Pur equivalent and I couldn't be happier.
5,Does what it advertizes,Ideal for one person use. Definitely removes any odor from water. Looks quite good. Does not taste too different/better than normal water but there definitely is a difference. It very well suited for my student life.
3,Filter doesn't really work,"I was fine with this product for the first few weeks, until I realized a substantial amount of black flecks at the bottom of the pitcher. I have no idea how that happened, but I'm assuming the filter is not what it should be. I rinsed out the pitcher and filter properly, and so far I haven't seen any more flecks (it's been about a month) but I don't quite trust Brita anymore...Also, I realized that anytime I would try to pour some water right after filling up the pitcher (when most of the water hadn't filtered down into the main pitcher yet), the pitcher's lid would come right off and water would come spilling out. This happened to me twice (spilling all over my coffeemaker once) until I realized why the pitcher lid was coming off. I'm not sure if I have a defective lid or if this happens with all the products, but either way it's a real inconvenience, and more importantly a danger to any electronics that may be lying a kitchen counter!"
4,good,It was exactly what I was looking for it is thin and fits well in a full fridge. Definitely a good product.
4,Solid product,"First of all, I have to admit that I can't make out the difference in the quality/ taste of the water after using this filter. I presume it does its job of purification.In terms of ease of use, I have had no complaints. It takes a few minutes to get the water through the filter, but I guess that's where the important processing is.Construction is good. No leakages. Easy to grip handle. And you can even pour out filtered water while the top half has water in it( being filtered).Some carbon particles are visible in the top compartment, but doesn't affect the filtered water.Overall a very satisfactory product."
5,Best purchase ever!,"i normally hate water, but this brita thing has opened my eyes! i really enjoy it and am glad to have purchased it"
3,Not too happy,"The prints are of pretty low quality. I am kind of disappointed with this purchase. Every card shows the lower private area fully exposed, with most models needing a bad shave (yes, they are models from ""that"" era...definitely not the recent models). I am giving this card deck an average rating simply because it is full nude. Otherwise, it would have earned only one star from me. However, if asked to recommend, I would not."
4,Helpful,I was looking for an alternative to the prescriptions I had been taking because of the side effects. This book gave me guidance as to what direction to take. Dr. Mindell is a wonderful writer and I have taken his vitamins and am now relying on his knowledge to replace prescriptions with natural remedies.
3,Prescription pills versus ?,"This book didn't tell me much that I didn't already know, but it did remind me of the dangers of taking every darned prescription the doctor can come up with. You know, take this for that ... oh, and then take this other for the side effects of the first one, etc., etc."
2,Good - but I expected more.,"It's an okay book, don't get me wrong. It does give you good alternatives to take for certain things, but I was expecting a ""list"" like book ..and it's just tons of reading IMO. It also didn't even have info on sinus problems, and as far as back pain ..it refers to you another book instead of telling you about an alternative medication. Glad I spend under $5 for this. :("
5,Run Toto Run!,"My 2 and 1/2 year old granddaughter LOVES ""The Wizard of Oz"", with Toto being her favorite. She told Santa Claus that she wanted Toto for Christmas. I found this dog at amazon.com and ordered it. When I received it I tied a blue and white checked ribbon around its neck, and Santa Claus delivered it. It is adorable! Granddaughter is thrilled, and so are we."
2,OK for the price,"The colors are bright and attractive but the cloth is rough and stiff, even after washing."
2,"Brighter than picture, a little stiff","This bandanna is a bright, royal blue--much brighter than in the picture. Otherwise, it's fine. It's not especially soft, but for four dollars, it's not so bad."
5,A delightful Bonnie Evening!,"A dvd well worth the puchase. I had seen no reviews on this concert so I was wary of buying. The three scottish tenors (Caledon) are very good- Auld lang syne is very well done. The real treat is the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra-- check out tracks 7,8 and 11-they will have you doing a jig in front of the television! If you have any Scottish blood in you this concert will touch you. It is filmed beautifully in front of Edinburgh Castle at dusk. I only wish it was a little longer than 77 mins ---other than that-- highly recommended!"
5,WONDERFUL,Awesome concert. Excellent music. The bagpipes added so much. We have watched this MANY times and hope that they make anopther DVD soon.
3,insightful,"This collaborative effects breaks the back on often overlooked issues of globalization. Tzonis brings the books into focus, creating layers of comparisons between conditions and countries otherwise unrelated. As well the book becomes the highlight on some unknown but rather talented architects working within a space cultured by globalization."
3,Reread,Read this in 5th or 6th grade and loved it then. It was cool to reread this as an adult but was clearly written for a younger audience.
2,Fingernails on a chalkboard,"What struck me about this book is the intensity to which my head felt like exploding while reading it. I hate to leave books unfinished, and I used to think that was a good habit. If you have such a habit, may I suggest against this book at the sake of your health."
2,it was OKAY,"we had to read this book for 7th grade at our school. it's kinda stupid, but kinda good. I personally thought that we should have known more about how Ameni ended up in a sealed sarcophagus and was still 'alive'. Whatever. It was a good book...sort of."
3,FYI,"FYI, this compilation contains ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""The Last Man on Earth"", and ""The Bat"". Unfortunately, ""The Bat"" is the silent version from the twenties, not the Vincent Price version. If you search 'Vincent Price', there is another compliation of the same movies for the same price. Accoring to the reviews of that compilation, each of the movies has Vincent Price as the star!"
3,"Good films, BAD transfer!","There are three films on this disk, two with Vincent Price, (""House On Haunted Hill"" And ""The Last Man On Earth""). The third film is the silent version of ""The Bat"", NOT with Vincent Price. This mix up did not bother me since I did not have the silent version and I think it is better than the remake.The main problem with this ""collection"" is the transfer. It says on the cover that the films have been ""Re-Mastered for Best Possible Picture Quality"". This is not true. This is in fact one of the worst transfer I have seen, both regarding the sound and picture. The silent film has just a random classical music, which usually does not fit to the action in the film.All of these films are good and the DVD does not cost much, so if you don't care about transfer then buy it. I for one will be buying all of these films again, in a better transfer."
3,Not sure but wrong movie.....,"Help me out if I'm mistaken. I purchased this CD for my wife becuase she's a huge VP fan. The movie ""The Bat"" is not the 1959 one with VP. It's a silent film that must be the original from the 1920's. I'm amazed the makers didn't catch this. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this. I'm not happy and would like Amazon to send me the correct ""The Bat"". I gave it 3 stars becuase you just can beat the cheese of VP!"
3,The wrong version,"As other reviewers have said, the version of ""The Bat"" on the DVD is the wrong one- no Vincent Price. The other two are semi-okay quality, but I've seen better versions of VP movies. I would recommend finding another version!"
5,Review,"Greenstein's The Presidential Difference is short and sweet. It condenses the story of our Presidents from FDR to George W. Bush into an easy to read manner. Each chapter is dedicated to a President and gives six points upon which they are evaluated, which makes comparisons with other Presidents in the book easy. Even with only 223 pages nothing seems to be left out. The book is engaging from beginning to end and before you know it you have gone through twelve presidencies. To end it all Greenstein wraps 13 chapters up in a magnificent conclusion titled ""Lessons from the Modern Presidency"". There isn't any more one can ask for. I highly recommend this book as a good read, that is fun, short, and a great way to brush up on knowledge of our Presidents."
4,"Good read, but repetitive at times.","This is a great book on all the modern Presidents from FDR to George Walker Bush. It is organized by chapters on each President, and addresses subthemes such as the President's cognitive style, emotional intelligence, etc. It contains a lot of great anecdotal evidence, and offers great insight on the evolution of the Presidential Office, and how different factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic to the President) affect success and failure.Some parts of the book felt inflated - like the author really didn't have much to say about the topic, but felt he had to write something anyway. Also, I don't agree with his assessments with some Presidents, namely JFK, but all in all I would recommend this book for its very straightforward diction, and informative content."
3,A bit light,"This book seemed too easy a read to be taken seriously. Although the author's takes on the various presidents are interesting, he skims through them all too quickly to go into any serious detail on any of them, instead just giving brief little sum-ups. Nice little preview, but feels like there's not much substance."
4,Amazing,I bought this book a couple of years ago and I still consult it. My birthday is May 12th and I read my page over and over for entertainment when I'm bored. It says that I'll be married at an early age. Yikes lol I'm 17 at the moment. Everything Judith says is true about my personality though. It's indescribable. The reason I gave it four stars was because I would have liked more than one page on my birthday.
4,"Interesting, and somewhat accurate","This book is an interesting look at your birthday and how it seems to affect personality and character. I did not think my birthday description was correct, but it did seem accurate for some of my friends. (it is hard to be objective on one's own personality)I first read this book while waiting for an intuitive reading, and decided to buy it. It is fun to share with friends, and I have used it as an ice breaker for a get-together.The book gives colors, gems, flowers and fragrances for your birthday. As well, your lucky numbers, charms, best day of the week. etc. Judith then gives a description of your personality and it is fun to read about those close to you to see if the description fits. Entertaining, and detailed."
3,Gameplay ruined what could be the best of all Batman games!,"In this game is painfully awfull to control Batman while from another point, the story is awesome and the graphics captures the great atmosphere from the animated series! A real Batman animated serie episode transported to the game space. But after a while, trying to control Batman, taking as much care as you can to not fall everytime, you get tired and seems to feel that you got a bad case of arthritis in the hand. It's really boring!! It passed two weeks after I got the game and I was still stuck in the fourth stage, while if the gameplay was better, it would be easier and really fun to keep going. I'm a sick Batman fan, but unfortunately I have to say: this could be a great Batman game, but the gameplay simply ruined it!"
4,Comic book comes alive,"This is a great game. It loosely follows the detective comics book. No Robin though. Bat girl is in it, no Alfred, but his voice is in it. It's little confusing but a well put together game. If you're a Batman fan, you should get this."
4,"108"" fits kids as young as 6 yrs old.",the lenght could fit kids from ages 6 yrs old up to adult female weighting 115 lds below. it has a thumb loop too. it comes in pairs.
1,"too short, poor quality","way too short for an adult who actually knows how to wrap his hands. May work for kids or cardio kickboxing. The material is also thin, rough, cheap, compared with other hand wraps I use. Surprised Everlast would allow their name to be put on this."
3,hand wraps,"The wraps were brand new but looked as if they were worn or stitched improperly. They are functional, but you get what you pay for."
2,ONLY 108,They are nice enough but not clear that they are only 108.. Not long enough.. Will have to order 180's!
4,work as intended,"The straps are of good quality and perform as intended. The only cons is the funny tobacco smell after use (I have not washed them yet, may be that's the problem:)"
1,I had to throw them out,"These hand wraps do not have elastic and are not good (at least for what I needed them: cardio kickboxing class). The club owner said I should not use them as this may hurt my knuckles (he was okay with the gloves I bought from Everlast and actually said they were great, but not with this)."
1,"Comes up in search results for 180"" wraps... but they are only 108!!!!!!","I did a search for -- hand wraps 180""-- and these came up in the results. I brought them to my kickboxing class, only to realize (when I was wrapping for class) they were WAAAAAY too short! I'm female and disagree with the above statement saying ""they are good for women"". (Note: I wear a size 9 ring, and 8"" bracelets.) If you're a kid, or petite woman, this might work. If not.. keep looking and make sure you find the LENGTH in the description!"
1,WAY TOO SHORT,"These wraps are a youth length and THE AD SHOULD HAVE STATED SO!!! Way too short for any practical use, coverage or protection."
2,Way too short!,"I have smallish hands, but these are still way too short. They don't stretch at all which makes them difficult to use. The same material might be okay for longer wraps because you could wrap between your fingers, but I still prefer wraps with some elastic. As far as I'm concerned, these were a complete waste of money."
1,"JR size!!! 108""","Yes, it's too short!! The regular ones are 180"" so it's like half length... I have small hands so I thought, maybe, but no, these are for KIDS!It's not cool that the description doesn't specify this as kids size. I won't recommend even if you have small hands. Get the 180""."
3,cheap but effective,"These will do the job, but will leave you wishing you spent a little more on a better set of wraps. These are not really long enough to do a proper wrap and the material is pretty cheap. It will get the job done, but it could be much better."
1,Avoid these.....,"I received these for free with a pair of MMA gloves I bought, and they are very short and wear out very quickly. After a 2 weeks I was wrapping my hands with socks because these were completely useless. I would recommend the Combat Sports Wraps as they are both cheaper and better quality."
1,Not for beginners,"These handwraps were accidently ordered. I am a kickboxing instructor at a gym and from exprience, especially for fitness classes, the handwraps that are cotton/spandex blend are better because they are longer and stretch more. These are a lot shorter and don't stretch. I had to relearn how to wrap my hands with these and it's not as good as the cotton/spandex. If it wouldn't have taken what I paid for them to send them back I would have."
1,"Too short, non elastic and thick fabric","Just don't ever buy these. As the title says, it is short for an adult, non elastic and thick. It feels uncomfortable and unsafe as a protectionJust my 2 cents."
1,Thumb loop ripped off after 1 use,I bought these cause I thought they'd be better than the title ones I have but we're very disappointing. Thumb loop broke after 1 boxing class
4,Cheap wraps,They were cheap and they work for wrapping your hands and wrists. They weren't particularly elastic and they feel like they will wear out pretty quickly but for around $2 its not bad to just practice with.
5,Great wraps for the price,these wraps are great. If you need longer wraps go for the Mexican style wraps. My hands are a bit smaller so it's fine for me. Definitely helps protect my hands when I hit the heavy bag. You definitely need wraps if you're going to do that.
2,Waaay too short for an adult hand,"These hand wraps are not nearly long enough to properly wrap an adult hand. This would be ok if the 108"" length was noted on the description. A normal wrap is 180"". The quality of the webbing is fine, and they would be fine wraps for a child."
1,Complete Trash,"No where on here was it listed that they were 108in hand wraps , they dont have the thumb loop sewn on in a direction so as you wrap your hands its somewhat of a guess which way the velcro is going to end up , they also have no give , flexibility or comfort . I guess its ok if you are buying them for children who dont take boxing too seriously but coming from someone whos been in the sport for a while I feel like an idiot for buying these. Im going to stick to Hayabusa wraps since they are the best out there and these Everlast wraps are going in the trash"
2,Cheap Things,"While of sufficient length for my purposes and providing sufficient support when wrapped correctly, the velcro seems to be poorly sewn. I ripped one after only 4 uses and was not utilizing any excessive force or altering my manner from any of the other previous uses."
2,No Dante Club,I thoroughly enjoyed Dante Club and eagerly scooped up Shadow of Poe. It was brooding and directionless. It felt solitary with no fun or mystery to solve.
1,ZZZZZZZ,"This novel was very tedious reading.Did you complete it ?Yes.Why?I kept thinking it'd get better...Lame.Yeah, but other books have gotten better toward the last third.But not this one?No.What specifically did you not like?A mystery not really solved; a period piece not giving us much descriptive context; and a main character who might have carried a hobby into an obsession, and nearly ruining his life, without giving us an understanding of why he couldn't have kept his business and his personal life in order while still uncovering what he did. And it's too long.Well, why did you give it one star?I couldn't give it less."
1,oh my - it must be hard to write such a bad story,"I purchased this book with great excitement after reading the Dante Club. This book has to be one of the worst stories ever written. The characters were flat and one dimensional, with unjustified motivations. The story was as interesting as watching the grass grow. I noticed a lot of people who liked the book were huge fans of the subject matter and said little about the attrributes of the book itself, that is because the book is a waste of time. Do yourself a favor - read the preview and see just how right I am."
3,"Love Poe, but...","This book is putting me in a coma. Being an avid Edgar Allan Poe fan since the age of 11, I jumped at the chance to read this book. Books 1 and 2 were exciting and hopeful. Then I got to book 3: what a drag. I started not to care about the characters as there was too much rambling about. There was a bit of a spark by the 4th book. I just got to the final book and I just can't go on. I loved the Dante' Club! The Poe Shadow should have been shortened by 100 pages."
1,A disappointment,"I stumbled onto the Pearl's first novel, 'The Dante Club', and was pleasantly surprised. When I saw Pearl's second novel, 'The Poe Shadow', I was excited.Unfortunately, the sophmore slump has struck. This book deals with the mysterious death of Edgar Allen Poe. The main character, Quentin Clark, becomes obsessed with trying to find out the circumstances of Poe's death and why many people (including relatives) seem to be hiding things. Clark travels to France in search of the real person who inspired Poe's character, Dupin.This novel moved very slowly, and I found it difficult to keep my interest. The character of Clark was very obsessed with the death of Poe, but I think the end did not justify the efforts that he put forth. The end wrapped some of the story lines too neatly for my tastes.Sorry, but I would not recommend this book. Definitely give 'The Dante Club' a try!"
2,tedious,"I tried reading it and couldnt get through it. Then i listened to it as a book on tape. Couldnt wait for it to end, and I love Poe"
3,Entertaining historical details,"The author is quite an expert on the facts surrounding Poe's mysterious death, and this expertise provides a very interesting thread through the novel. Pearl also expertly captures the spirit and language of the era. On the down side, I found the protagonist an annoying, selfish twit, which is hard to endure in a story delivered in the first person. The reader cannot fathom why the fool is so obsessed with the death of Poe, squandering career and sacrificing fiancee to chase the clues. But if you swallow that unlikely premise, and focus instead on the language and the mystery of Poe, it is a fairly entertaining read."
2,A confusing and over-long novel,"This novel reads more like a rough draft than a finished novel. Throughout the book the text contradicts itself frequently - for example: in one section of the book the main character is unable to sit up due to restraints around his neck. Only two sentences later, he sits up. Also, the main character loses consciousness very frequently, and so that action loses all of its drama after it happens a few times."
2,One year...,"That's how long it took me to read this book.I'm not a slow reader; that's how pain-stakingly slow paced this book is. I literally dreaded reading it.I've skimmed some of the other reviews for The Poe Shadow and I was relieved to find that I am not an overly-critical, literary snob in my judgement of this book; many others share my view. The book had potential to be great (written about the literary king of macabre, Poe; change of scenery, from U.S. to France; semi-strong unconventional female character, Bonjour) but it just seemed to ride on the coat-tails of historical facts. There were too many facts and not enough development of the plot or pacing.I had hoped it would at least end with a bang but alas, it did not. I'm not even sure if it ever reached it's climax, it was that weak. =\"
1,Boring and Repetitive!,"This is one of my most disappointing reads in a long while. I enjoyed The Dante Club, but the author was ""out to lunch"" on this one. If I could have, I would have returned the book and requested a refund."
2,Tedious,"This is probably the most tedious book I have ever read from start to finish. While there is new information about the death of Poe, this could have been presented more succinctly in an article in a literary journal."
1,disappointing,"I had come across Pearl's first book The Dante Club a while back and thought it was a pretty good book. So when I saw that he had written another book I was excited, esp sice it involved E.A.Poe - one of my favorite writers. I was highly disappointed with this book. It's narration is disjointed to the point of distracting, rushed and hurried in some places and slow to the point of dreadful in others. The plot twists are more annoying than suspensful because you just really want to get the story over with instead of having to read another confusing storyline. Overall i finished the book only to see if it got better towards the end and because i can not leave a book unfinished."
1,Overly-contrived potboiler,"'I didn't find this book very interesting; in fact, I didn't finish it. It is a work of fiction, a period piece, in which a young lawyer in Baltimore, one Quentin Clark, attends Edgar Allan Poe's funeral in that city (Poe died there in mysterious circumstances on October 7, 1849, at age 40). Afterward, Clark travels to Paris to look up C. Auguste Dupin, the father of all fictional private detectives, introduced to the world by Poe. Clark's purpose for this visit is an attempt to put together the true story of Poe's demise.The book should have interested me because I have read much Poe, I like mystery stories, and much of it takes place in Baltimore (although around 1849), in a suburb of which I have lived for many years. But somehow it didn't. For me, it was an overly-contrived potboiler."
1,Perhaps the most boring book I've ever read.,"As a fan of Poe, I was drawn to this book. However, this book is tedious. I find that the most I can read at a sitting is about ten pages. It has a virtually meaningless plot told by even duller prose. It could have been improved by cutting about 300 pages on the editor's floor and duplicating Poe's prose expertise--the short story. Do yourself a favor and read some of the original work of Edgar Allen Poe. I rate this a 1 star because Amazon has no zero stars."
1,Slow Going...,"I'm glad that I borrowed this book from the library so that I didn't feel compelled to finish it because I paid money for it. Although, I DID finish the book (I'm just weird that way). It was slow and ponderous at the beginning AND at the ending. I was truly happy to be done with it today so that I could check it back in and move on to some GREAT fiction!"
4,Poe and principles,"Many mysteries are intriguing, but none so much as a real one. The question surrounding the suspicious circumstances of the death of EAP have long puzzled readers and armchair detectives alike. Less dry and wordy than Dante Club, The Poe Shadow has been crafted with ingenuity and a hint of conspiracy and menace. Quentin Clark risks his professional reputation as well as his personal relationships for his principled idealism, and pursues what others see as a pointless obsession to uncover the truth about a man he admires and believes in, in spite of Poe's unsavory popular image. Matthew Pearl is improving as a writer of historical fiction. The Poe Shadow intrigues from start to finish."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"As a Baltimorean and a fan of Edgar Allan Poe, I was immediately attracted to this book. I had also read Dante Club, which although not one of my favorites, was well written and engaging. The Poe Shadow, on the other hand, was a terrible disappointment. The actual writing was terrible, the plot lacking, and the characters uninteresting. The main character was abysmally stupid, and his inner monologue almost drove me crazy. I wanted to put it down without finishing it, but I thought that it might get more exciting. That was not to be. If you are looking for a mystery, pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or if you are looking for more about Poe, read a biography. I doubt I will read Pearl again after this."
2,Disappointing,"Loved 'Dante Club', this one left me cold and honestly, I had to force myself to finish it. And I'm still not sure what happened. Buy Louis Bayard's 'The Pale Blue Eye' for a far more entertaining fictional take on Poe."
3,"Too much historical detail, too little plot","Escapist fiction with loads of historical detail. Sometimes too much historical detail: I ended up skimming much of it yet didn't lose the thread of the mystery. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary, particularly about why the main character would suddenly become completely obsessed with solving a dusty old mystery merely in order to clear the name of someone he never met."
4,An interesting channel for new information,"This book seems to take an excessive number of twists and turns, but I suppose it is all in the interest of showing just how hard it can be to tease the likely truth out of a welter of information and misinformation. In the end I learned that some new information has recently been uncovered about the death of Edgar Poe which suggests that Poe may not have actually drunk himself to death, as the popular account states. I think it was worth the trip through all the detours to learn this important piece of information about such a well-known American author."
5,Absolutely heart-breaking but written with love.,"I could not put this book down. Linda Gray Sexton's honesty was enlightening. She portrayed her mother as more than a woman with a mental illness. It is a portrait of a smart intelligent woman struggling to find meaning in her mentally ill life who at times rises above it but eventually succumbs. It is evident that Anne loved her daughters, but showed it in atypical ways. After reading this book, I find myself very interested in the work of Anne Sexton and her life. It gives a fresh and candid glimpse at this amazingly talented, yet tragic woman and a daughter who struggled to make sense out of her mother's love."
2,"lightning doesn't strike twice for "" stormin' norman ""","nothing original here.vocally, norman continues to sound like greg allman, his (norman's) trademark from pre-""jolly brothers"" days with the venerable ""cole county blues band"" (wonderful band).the songs are lyrically WEAK..keyboard solos are conspicuous in their absence...rance's bar-band molded guitar leads fall flat.this cd reveals no trace of the promise of great musical accomplishment that norman once surely held...norman could use some songwriting tips from his brother, al ( tookie ) jolly..."
4,Buy it. You will not regret.,"This is clearly a good buy. I have had this bag over a year now. The wear and tear has begun to show, But after two overseas trip. With all the space and pockets it is easy to store stuff, which helps me greatly with TSA."
4,Cuisipro Stainless Steel Food Mill,"The mill works very well. Well made, easy to use. The instuction are short. Over all,I say it's worth buying."
5,Oh potatoes!,"You've GOT to try mashed potatoes done with a food mill. They are superb!As food mills go, this is a good one. It's really sturdy and comes apart easily for cleaning. I like this one better than some of the more expensive brands, (Rosle). It's also a little more solid than some of the cheaper brands. In all, it's a pretty good value. Hey, anything that's dishwasher safe is okay by me! I also love the fact that this comes with three disks, I've used all of them.I use my food mill for a variety of tasks, as you probably already guessed, mashed potatoes are my favorite."
5,My favorite kind of gadget,"It's simple, well made, and works exactly as intended. I don't own a food processor; and the mill, along with a mortar and pestle and a good knife means I won't ever need one. The mill does a terrific job of making purees and straining foods such as tomatoes.Fully agree with the reviewer who loved it for mashed potatoes. It also works really well when making pureed vegetable soups. Try cooking butternut squash and apples together in stock, season to taste, strain (reserving the stock), and puree the cooked veg and fruit through the mill. Mix in enough of the reserved stock to get to a consistency you like. Serve in warm soup bowls with a dollop of yogurt or creme freche and you have heaven.It's very easy to clean. I bought mine at a store and they had lost the instructions; but, if you can't figure out this simple device you shouldn't be playing with kitchen implements anyway."
3,Not worth the price,"Have to agree with another reviewer, the smooth surface of the discs makes it very difficult to use with many foods. This is better suited for very soft non-slippery foods such as potatoes, it's easier and less clean-up to use a ricer."
4,very cool indeed,"Transcriptions of some of Mr. Peart's best drum parts of the ""middle"" Rush-era. If you're interested in kit drumming and haven't been turned onto Neil Peart, check this book out to find out what you've been missing. There are a lot of unique and creative patterns in this book.(I would give the book 5 stars for the subject matter, but there's a small transcription error in ""Subdivisions"" - I suspect there may be a few more lurking in there.)"
5,Highly recommend for the Intermediate to Advanced Drummer!,"I have been using this book for over 12 years now. I received it as a gift during my senior year of high school, and used the book so much that it was literally falling apart. I had to get a replacement. I have also used this book to teach to some of my drum students. Although I have found a few mistakes, the rhythms and time signatures are very accurate.I find it very useful to not only teach time changes and reading skills, but to teach continuity even when mistakes happen.Neil Peart's drumming exhibits finesse and is incredibly intricate. The drummer that uses this book will learn not the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid) method to drumming and timekeeping, but the M.U.S.I.C. (make up something interesting and complimentary) method.I would highly recommend this book to any RUSH fan or intermediate to advanced drummer looking to add a few more ""tools"" to their percussive toolbox."
2,"Precision transcription, this is not","Considering that Neil Peart is best known for his precision and consistency, I was disappointed with this frequently inaccurate effort. The inaccuracies are sometimes amusing - Mr. Wheeler's 'imagined' fills are in places a bit harder and less intuitive than Mr. Peart's actual parts. Mostly I was disconcerted however that the author himself apparently has not quite mastered Mr. Peart's work and subsequently has misled rather elightened many students of the art. I'm curious to know if Mr. Peart was ever made aware of the errors and if so what his reactions must have been (he has said that he does not read music and hence did not review the transcriptions personally)."
5,Soulful Zydeco!,"One of my favorite Zydeco cd's of all time! Pure party music with some serious accordian playing, tight band, high energy and soulful singing that reach down deep into your soul! Saw him at The Jammin' for Salmon festival in Portland, Oregon on August 6, 2001 and he was the only artist at the festival who got the crowd into a dancing frenzy and put smiles on everyone! I had the opportunity to meet him and take a photo with him (a very nice man!), I have that photo online on my webpage. Play him often on The Crazy Coyote Blues and Jazz Power Show 1490 KOTY in southcentral Wa. state."
2,Coffee maker fine. Frother bogus.,"I brought the capresso maker for primarily the frother. After two uses of the frother, it did not work, or it took too long.That was about 200 dollars for a function that I do not even use now. It is basically a coffee maker, which i could have PAID for a lot less."
3,Pain in the neck,"I agree with everyone that this makes excellent coffee and froths milk terrifically....but the water leaks out like a sieve after 2 years. I have to take off all removable parts (the carafe, the water reservoir, the milk container, the drain thingee in 2 parts, the gold filter) everytime I make a new pot; turn the entire machine over and remove water that collects under the reservoir. Even after doing this....it still may leak when I brew a new pot!!! What a pain in the neck!! Capresso will repair it for $65.00...hmmmphhhhhhh. Might as well just buy a new machine."
5,FANTASTIC COFFEE MAKER - Handsdown!,"I had a Mr. Coffee machine for 7 years and it still works fine. I just decided it was time for a fancier upgrade. The coffee maker features are easy to understand. The brewing is quick, QUIET and the coffee is HOT (you can add cold milk and still have a hot cup of coffee). The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. The milk frother is also very easy to use and you can either heat or froth your milk. Steam (froth) function is ready after 60 seconds warm up time - compared to other machines that are noisy and take a lot longer. The water tank detaches which I love; no spilling water! The gold filter is a nice green component as well. The machine takes up a bit more of counter space but it looks really stylish so I don't mind at all. Yeah, research was tiring but I am so glad, I spent the time and found this machine! I can only highly recommend it."
5,Wow !,"This coffee machine combines brew-through the lid technology, stainless steel thermal carafe, and a detachable milk frother. We use the frother just as frequently for making quick hot chocolate drinks from chocolate milk. The coffee brewer is superior and so is the well-designed stainless steel carafe. Capresso is the leading edge in coffee maker design and has an outstanding customer service department. We just were in such a hurry to use our new machine we didn't bother reading the instructions, so we ended up calling the toll free number twice and each time we were treated courteously and efficiently. We got the impression that this is a small enough company that still cares about it's customers. This machine is a winner and we are now giving them as gifts."
3,Capresso good bad & the ugly,"Good: makes a great cup of joe in record timeBad: the extra water in the tank leaks like a seive. Countless times all the water has leaked out over nite.Ugly: Reset the clock and timer every morning. When timer kicks on b/4 the coffee makes, it screws up the clock.I guess the good coffee outweighs the bad parts, but its still irritating"
3,"Good coffee, but too many problems...","I, too, did a lot of research before buying this machine. The Capresso CoffeeTEC makes good coffee, nice and hot and very fast. I experienced several problems with the operation of the FrothXpress system, despite following all the cleaning & operating instructions provided. Now after 1 and 1/2 years, the brewing function has stopped working as well. I give up. This product was too expensive for this many problems to arise. On the positive side, customer service was pretty helpful (until the warranty was up)."
4,great coffee maker,One of the best coffeemakers I have ever purchased and I have owned many Krups models. I love good coffee. The stainless carafe keeps the coffee piping hot for hours. We use the expresso for hot chocolate and it is great. Hint: Use chocolate milk and a tablespoon of your favorite hot chocolate mix. Put the hot chocolate mix in your cup and express the hot chocolate. It's great!
1,Had to return FOUR Capresso Units,"We ordered, took delivery, opened, tried, called customer service and returned four different Capresso units over a two month period. The frothing function wouldn't work correctly. We decided to keep our four year old capresso coffeemaker (which works pretty well)and canceled our order. On the positive side, I did learn how to return merchandise through UPS and thankfully, UPS did a good job."
1,Capresso should be ashamed,"I bought this extremely expensive coffee maker because it purportedly made better tasting, hotter coffee. Not only does it fail to do that, it's not a well made product. The swing out arm for the coffee basket has broken in three places. This is under gentle usage. The frother works well, but $200 is a bit steep for a coffee maker no better than a $30 Mr. Coffee and a frother. I don't know when I've ever bought anything that was more of a disappointment than this machine."
3,LOVE IT WHEN IT WORKS!,"THIS IS A GREAT MACHINE THAT HAS ALL THE RIGHT BELLS AND WHISTLES, LIKE AUTO PROGRAMING, STOPS TO POUR A CUP, COFFEE KEEPS RELATIVELY HOT IN THERMOS AND THE FROTH IS GREAT (WHEN IT WORKS) WE'VE OWNED THIS SINCE CHRISTMAS AND HAVE ALREADY HAD TO ORDER THE ""T"" PART FOR THE FROTHER. (EVEN THOUGH THEY INCLUDE 2) THEY MUST KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM IF THEY GIVE YOU AN EXTRA ONE FROM THE GET GO! BUT LIKE I SAID WITH A LOT OF CLEANING & MAINTAINING OF THE FROTHER PARTS AND SOMETIMES JUST ADJUSTING THE WAY THE MILK CONTAINER(THAT IS INCLUDED) SITS, YOU CAN GET GREAT FROTH FOR A NICE CAFFE LATTE! I WOULD THINK FOR $200 YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A FROTHER THAT WORKS WITHOUT YOU DOING SO MUCH WORK - BUT ATLEAST WHEN IT DOES...ITS WORTH IT!"
2,Short lived Quality,"It was heaven!! For 2 mos., we had tasty fresh brewed coffee with frothed milk at our finger tips. We were spoiled. But now, 4 mos into the $200.00 plus coffeemaker, it is leaking all over the counter if we try to use the ""auto"" feature. And worse, the threads on the steam nozzle have eroded and the froth feature can only be used if we literally hold the apparatus together with our fingers! Otherwise the pressure blows the nozzle with a burst of steam, down into the cup below. It is a complete disappointment. I have contacted Capresso and asked for a replacement nozzle. Instead they want me to send the entire coffee maker (leaving me with NOTHING). Very unsatisfactory and for the money, not worth it. I could have spent the $200 on a more reliable machine and frankly, won't buy this brand again."
1,Doesn't keep coffee hot,"I'd give it two stars, but for the price and the poor job the thermal carafe does keeping the coffee hot. I normally make about 6 cups in the morning. After 20-30 minutes the coffee is not even drinkably warm. Frothing feature works, but it's more trouble than it's worth. Capresso says it's not aware of the thermal carafe problem, which I do not believe (see epinions.com) and will not exchange the machine for a different model. They said they would send me a new carafe, though I don't think that a new poorly designed carafe that doesn't live up to its manufacturer's claim (hot coffee for 4 hours) will solve the problem. I use a Cuisinart thermal carafe machine now (99.00). I set it to make 6 cups at 5:30AM, and it is piping hot, even if I don't drink it until 7 or 8 AM."
1,customer disservice,"After having this machine for less than two years, it had an electrical problem and I sent it back to the company and for $65 they sent me a new unit. Unfortunately it did not work and customer service after stating we must have a bad electical outlet, sent us another one. It didn't work either and this time I plugged it into my computer plug which is fine as is our kitchen outlet. To get my money back I had to talk to a supervisor, but he didn't call me back. Three phone calls later they finally sent my money back, but still no supervisor called us. I wrote to Mr. Kramm and complained about the shoddy treatment I received from customer service and from the broken units from the repair service. NO RESPONSE from a company that is supposed to depend on word of mouth to buy their very expensive product. Shame on them."
1,A $200.00 PIECE OF JUNK,"I'VE HAD MINE FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW, WELL, THE FIRST FEW WEEKS, I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE THING LEAKING (3 TIMES)THEY KEPT SENDING ME WATER CONTAINERS. THE CARAFFE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE COFFEE HOT FOR 4 HOURS, WELL, THAT'S A BUNCH OF BULL. YOU'RE LUCKY IF IT STAYS FOR ONE. I CALLED UP SO MANY TIMES , THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE IT!!!!!NOW I CAN'T EVEN USE IT, AS SOON AS YOU PUT THE WATER CONTAINER IN THE MACHINE, IT STARTS POURING OUT WATER EVERYWHERE. THEY WANT $65.00 TO REPLACE A 50 CENT SEAL, THATS WORN OUT. I OFFERED THEM $10.00 FOR THE STUPID THING, THEY WOUDN'T EVEN SEND IT TO ME FOR THAT. YOU CAN'T EVEN SPEAK TO A MANAGER THEY JUST DON'T LET YOU!!!!!I WOULD OF BEEN BETTER OFF BUYING MY $30.00 MR.COFFEE MACHINES EVERY 2-3 YEARS, INSTEAD OF THIS $200.00 PIECE OF JUNK . IT WOULD OF BEEN A LOT CHEAPER.I WOUDN'T HAVE BEEN SO MAD IF THEY REPLACED IT WITH A NEW ONE WHEN THEY FIGURED OUT I GOT STUCK WITH A LEMON!!!!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, YOU WORK TOO HARD FOR IT!!!!!"
5,Best.Coffee.Maker.Ever.,"Love this coffee maker! Love that I can steam milk easily for a classier coffee when I'm in the mood. Doesn't take up any more counter space than our old standard coffee maker. Brews really quickly. Can't figure out why they discontinued it, its great!"
4,Great Coffee,"We love this coffee maker, especially the stainless steel carafe, which keeps the coffee very hot but doesn't allow it to overcook or get too strong as a carafe on a heating element would."
2,Just another high dollar coffee maker,"Don’t spend your money looking for real cappuccino taste, you won’t get it with this coffee maker, hens the name “coffee maker”"
3,Worked Well For About a Week... But...,"The coffee was perfectly hot, the milk completely frothed. A week or so later and although hot, the coffee isn't as hot, and the milk is barely frothed. I guess I should expect to pay much more than $200 to receive the features I wanted..."
3,"GREAT Coffee, BUT durability issues","We first bought this machine ~2001, and have had to send it back for service 3 times at a charge of ~$60 each. It works great, but eventually (18-24 months) it begins to leak water, sometimes from the gasket where the removable reservior connects to the body of the machine, and sometimes from the interior of the machine. In the latter case we were told by the company that the pressures that build up inside the machine (due to the steaming functions, I suppose) can eventually create leaks in the ""plumbing"". Most recently, the electronics have gone out and we do not plan to pay another sixty bucks for ""service"" but are replacing it with a less complicated model. If you have an espreso machine, you can steam with that, and it does a better job anyway. This is a terrific coffee maker at a fair initial price, but expect to pay another $60 every couple of years to keep it working."
4,ghost whisperer pilot,"Being a long time fan of the series ""Ghost Whisperer"", its great that I can buy individual episodes. I just can't swing the amount for the full season all at once, so its perfect that I can get them one at a time. Also, the clarity of sound and picture is very good. I get to watch on my Kindle Fire HD anywhere I want. Absolutely love the pilot to the series, and recommend it to anyone that loves a not scary ghost story."
5,Quick arrival,It seems like i ordered this product one day and received it the next day. This was a gift for xmas so i con't comment on the content. Arrived in perfect condition
5,Excellent,"In buying this series, I found a few episodes I missed. Plus, I got to revisit a few favorites."
1,No subtitles,"I purchased the first season based on the fact it was advertised as having English subtitles. This was important as I wanted to view the tape with my Thai wife. I was intending to purchase all the additional seasons if the first tape was satisfactory, but there are NO subtitles,making the tape useless to me. I will certainly not be purchasing any additional tapes of this series and I am frankly upset at the misrepresentation made by Amazon."
2,"Uh, the intro is interesting!","This sort of reminds me of Dead Like Me. As in, if you took Dead Like Me, took away everything that made it a good show, added some stupid to it, and shook it up I'm relatively certain you would come out with The Ghost Whisperer.Jennifer Love Hewitt's character is perfect. So perfect, in fact, she comes off as one dimension and fake. I'm not sure if it's just poorly written, or if she's just a bad actress.The guest stars tend to be very strong, but the plots often feel contrived. I enjoyed the supporting cast a bit more than Hewitt, especially Aisha Tyler. Only, I did not see much of them, as the show was myopically centered on Hewitt."
5,$61.99?,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO expensive!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted to but both Seasons, figuring I would pay $25-$29 for each Season, but $62 is out of control!!!"
5,The Ghost Whisperer (Season 1),"GREAT 1st Season!If you are a Fan of The Ghost Whisperer = You have to Own this One!Fantastic Picture & audio.JWHDrexel Hill,. Pa."
5,LOVE IT!!,THIS SHOW IS AWESOME AND I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO COME OUT!IT IS VERY REALISTIC. I HOPE THIS SHOW IS GOING TO BE ON THE AIR FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
3,"""comprised of""? I can't believe the Library Journal Ain't go no better English.","""comprised of""? I can't believe the Library Journal Ain't go no better English. It's description is included of mistakes in plain english.As for the scripts, they are some things Thomas did to try to earn a buck, something he always needed to do a better job of -- he was broke more often than he was drunk. They're collected here so the publisher can make a buck (presumably) and so that Thomas scholars had have ""complete editions."""
4,Loads of information!,"This book is full of information, but many of the questions are repeated in various places throughout the book. This tends to duplicate some information. Also, the index wasn't as hearty as I would have liked. I had difficulty looking up some basic topics.On the whole, this book is a great resource. It covers everything and did provide greater detail than I had seen in other books."
3,Basic and as inexpensive as they get,"Unfortunately, if you need a ruggedized case, this is as inexpensive as they come. If you want a truly ruggedized case for professional use, this is not it. If you use a quick release tripod attachment the camera does not fit in the case.It is quite effective for storing all of your cabling, power supply, tapes, and a few other accessories. And, let's face it, if you shelled out for the GL-2 you are going to want to protect it.If you truly need a well protected camera and intend to use a Bogen quick release mount, and are lugging this thing all over heck and back, get a custom cut case. Otherwise, this is a great deal at the price, and very sexy."
4,As good as can be.,"The author, convinced he had hit upon THE mountain man of mountain men, sketches together what little real information was available on Walker (virtually all is second or third hand and then very little...) and tries to convince us all other paled in comparison. Still, a good read leaving one hoping all his surmises are accurate. Walker, it seems, was a man's man--an AMERICAN man."
1,Westering Man The life of Joseph Walker,"I bought and read the Westering Man The life of Joseph Walker by Bil Gilbert. Save your money. The book is no good. Gilbert is not a historian, he puts to many of his non-history based opinions in the book. Joe Walker was a great man. You don't have to put down other great men to make him stand taller. Great men can stand on there own.Albert Spence"
3,Eh.....,"Looked GREAT........................ for about 3.5 weeks... I did drive about 3500 miles in that time, but by the end of 4 weeks it looked exactly like it did before. I'm about to try some stuff called Bumper & Cladding Coat PERMA SHINE.. Anyone know if it's any good? As for this stuff here, don't waste your time, it's not the answer to the never ending quest to restore faded plastic on Xterras, that's for sure. Gave it a 3 cause yeah, it did work, just not for long..... maybe if I had used like 2 cans on each part? I dunno...."
5,Best I have used for plastic trim on my truck,I have a toyota tacoma truck that has the black plastic wheel wells. If you have one of these trucks you know they get faded from the sun quickly. Armorall and others I have tried barely do the job.I bought some of this stuff and wow! The plastic just seems to suck up all the tire shine goodness. Brings it back to the original look quickly. Last quite long.Pretty happy with the product. If it rains you do have to apply another coat. Seems water takes it off. But does a good job against the sun.Works equally as well on the all other plastic parts of the outside including bumpers.
5,Best stuff ever!!,"This spray is so great! It's virtually effortless to make those grey or black plastic trim pieces on the exterior of your vehicle look just about brand new. Forget all those other products like ""Back to Black"" where you have to rub it in and buff it out. They just don't work for all the effort involved. Wash your vehicle as normal and just spray Trim Shine on the area you want to shine up and that's it! I can honestly say I don't feel like I wasted my money!"
4,Pretty Good Stuff for The Money,"I purchased Trim Shine after reading several reviews. I usually purchase a much more expensive product that does the same thing, but everyone is trying to economize in these woeful economic times. Trim Shine is a fine product and I'd recommend it to anyone trying to restore the exterior trim on his/her vehicle.I will be a return customer."
2,Trim Shine,"Big fan of Stoner products, but Trim Shine should only be used for internal areas, unless you wish to keep detailing the same panelsover and over. The 5 gallon container of Trim Shine does not have the water resistant properties as the spray cans, so beware.The spray can product makes panels look nice, and withstands rain, but only for a week or two. Very disappointed."
2,Not shining enough.,"Not sure if I am missing anything here. Used this several times after thoroughly washing the tires. Despite generous use, it did not give the shine that the car wash shops do.I follow the written instructions, but not working. When I take my vehicle to neighborhood car wash, their stuff works. Disappointed...."
2,"Poor design, difficult to fill","I bought this humidifier and realized very quickly that it was going to be extremely difficult to fill the water tank. As others have mentioned, the top has a spoon shape that acts as a carry handle, but when you turn the tank upside down to fill it, you can't rest it on it's top! Holding the tank while filling it is awkward - much less trying to hold it with one hand while screwing the fill cap on. This would be a nightmare for anyone that lacks upper body strength. Operationally the unit seems to run okay. I wish I would have bought one of the tower models instead."
1,Stopped Working,"I have used this unit lightly for two years and it just went dead. No power reading, fan doesn't run. Before this I found it a bit awkward to fill the tank and placing it back in the unit. This might be a bigger deal for older people or those with gripping issues with their hands. My biggest issue is that there is no trouble shoot for this issue. I am not going to simply guess on what part to order. I will just order a unit from a different manufacturer."
2,Terrible Design,"When everything's set up, it runs fine as it should. Somebody may have thought it was clever to build a handle into the water tank, but I highly doubt they actually tested it themselves. Because filling it up is a major annoyance, due to the lack of a flat surface to rest that tank on. There are multiple settings, which is better than what you get with most humidifiers at this price range. For people who like some white noise, a speed setting of 2 is whisper quiet, 3 is slightly less quiet, and 4 is a wind tunnel. How about some middle ground for 3?"
5,Tres Beau,"Absolutely wondrously beautiful, haunting music. Don't let the obscure label and cheap cover art fool you. At less than three dollars for a fine used copy, this is an absolute steal. Here we have two excellent musicians of the most beautiful-sounding instruments working with some of the greatest music created by one of the finest composers ever. The liner notes just provide some basic info on Debussy and the two performers. It is mentioned that Bert Lucarelli and Susan Jolles created all the arrangements.Also, as the one reviewer noted, there are 14 pieces here, not 13 as listed. Two of the pieces are harp solos, even though Arabesque #1 is not listed as such. Four of the other pieces can be heard in their entirety on YouTube. Once you hear these, you will want to hear the rest of this beautiful album."
1,to short,"its listed as 48"" the one thet sent was just 18"" it works just way to short i had to connect 2 to make it work"
2,I Don't Know?,"I was very excited about this release - 6 ""never before released"" live tracks. Maybe it's just me, but ""In My Darkest Hour"", ""Symphony of Destruction"", maybe ""Sweating Bullets, and I'm pretty sure ""Holy Wars,"" are all the exact same versions on the original ""Rude Awakening"" live disc. Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know. However, I love the two new Live tracks - ""Time/Use the Man"", and ""The Conjuring."""
1,Ztomeh....,You're a jackass. This album is a rip-off.... what better way to introduce a new Megadeth fan? Try buying Countdown to Extinction or Peace Sells...
5,STILL ALIVE AND WELL,Megadeth is the Best Band of The Universe!!!!!!!!!!Still Alive & Well Is a Great Album of Megadeth.
1,Pathetic and Horrible,"Well I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this and instead listened to it at the record store. Needless to say Dave's recent trip into rehab for the 17th time (he didn't hurt his wrist, he got hooked on pain pills during the last tour and his wife made his quit the band as everybody well knows at this point) no doubt hurt his finances and he had to sell off all his gear, plus put out this rehash of the new.How long is it going to take for Dave to learn he's already lost all his fans and that he's been a has-been since Risk? Stop putting out albums that no one buys dude. Maybe that's why you started the pain killers and drinking again?In the meantime, don't waste any money on this ""album""."
2,De ja vu!,"First off i'll start with the albums praise. The two new songs ""Time/Use the Man"" and ""The Conjuring"" are stellar live tracks, especially the latter. But other than those two the rest of the cd sounds vaguely familiar. Well that must be because the other live songs are on ""Rude Awakening"" and half the cd is off of ""The World Needs a Hero."" If i hadn't heard all this before it would have made a great album. My guess is that this cd was mandatory to fufill Megadeth's contract with Sanctuary. So if your looking to start your DethCollection, start at the first and work your way down the list."
1,There just isn't an excuse for this....,"When I first heard that Megadeth was releasing this ""album"", I thought,""Cool, a couple live tracks, and maybe some unreleased songs, b-sides, etc."" Damn, was I ever wrong!!!Megadeth basically [disappointed] us over with this one...six leftovers from the RUDE AWAKEING live album, and half of THE WORLD NEEDS A HERO, which was their last album! Let's face it, the only people still buying Megadeth albums are long-time die-hards, so chances are, anyone thinking of buying this album already owns TWNAH or RUDE AWAKEING. So why bother? There is no point.I realize Dave Mustaine wants to make a buck, but c'mon!!!I've bought all their albums over the last 15 years or so, I'm a longtime fan from when I was like 12 listening to PEACE SELLS...and I've never felt ripped off like this.Save your money for something else...anything else!!!!Cheap money grab / contract fulfillment I guess....."
1,"Contract fulfillment, pure and simple.","So, singer Dave Mustaine 'injures his arm' in January, they release an abysmal live album mid March, then 2 weeks later decides to inform the public of his 'injury' and announce the disbandment of Megadeth.5 months of silence, then the sudden announcement of this little ""gem"" comprised of 5 tracks that didn't make the cut on the aforementioned live album, and 5 already released tracks from their last studio album 'World Needs A Hero' - 5 tracks of a 12 track album recycled for this aborted release. Either they owed Sanctuary Records another release or Dave has resumed 'self medicating' himself. Either way avoid like the plague."
1,Overpriced Water Dispenser,"This product is mostly ""Hype"". Water ran through their filters tastes and looks exactly as before. You'd have just as good results with a coffee filter. If what you're looking for is just a water dispenser this thing was a nice size. If you're expecting it to make tap water drinkable look towards a real filtering system like reverse osmosis. If you want a decent filtering system you have to be willing to pay for it. In my opinion, this was a rip-off and I feel ashamed for having fell for it."
1,Not as expected,"I have received the shofar, the first thing I noticed it was the size, instead of 9-11"" that one has 8"" inc, the hole has a split, I am very dissapointed, the company never anwser me."
2,not at all like the picture,It would have been great if the shape was like the picture. Instead it was short and too curved. returned it for a full refund. was not offered a more suitable replacement which I would have taken.
4,Nice storage place,"I am always stumped on what to buy for my husband as he is extremely picky. He does love his acquired collection of watches and I thought this would be a nice gift to keep them all together. To my surprise, he loved this gift and is using the display box. It is very good qualify and roomy for his oversized watches. I am glad to have a place for him to keep his watches in one place and protect them as well."
4,Good purchase,"I gave this watch box 4 stars because the pillows are very cheap. The box itself, is sharp looking. A nice brown smooth leather. I like the key lock. The key is very small, so store it in a safe place.It holds four watches. My other two watches, are kept in my watch winder. I would have given the box five stars, if the pillows were of better qaulity."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Just recieved my new Tech Swiss Leather Watch Case from Amazon.And was pleasingly surprised at how nice this Box looks.I'ts very well made and not some flimsy piece of cardboard or plastic. The Leather outside is rich looking and the lock adds to it's overall integerty. The interior of the box is of a subtle medium brown color and very pleasing to the eye. The only reason i rated this at 4 stars is petty. The pillows that hold the watches, i felt were not as large as i would have like and not as soft or pillowy. But then again i didn't pay an arm and a leg for this Box. Great buy at this price and would not hesitate to recommend it to the beginng collector."
1,Stained my watches red.,"Although this box looked nice, after a week of use, and a ruined watch, this box has a serious flaw. It stains your watches red!I stored a limited edition white Casio G-Shock in this box, it is now a worthless semi-red Casio G-Shock. The red pillows and liner has permanently stained the white resin casing and band of the watch. No amount of bleach or other cleaner will remove the stain.I'm sure Amazon will refund my money for this box, but who's going to refund my money for my G-Shock?"
3,Not impressed.,"This box will fulfill the need my husband has for a central place to put his watches. Not impressed with the quality. It does not look like leather, but an imitation."
1,"not great, I returned it",The string on the bow was not well made and the piece smelled very toxic.I returned it after I left the case open trying to air out the chemical smell but it didn't help.I did appreciate the refund from the seller.
1,Wasen't what I expected,"It was a collectable toy to put on a shelf, I thought I was buying an instrument..."
1,STUPID,"you can only read this if you:-have IQ lower than 30-like mindless violence-like Fat Wreck style ""wanna be punk bands""i really dont know who is this book for. little boys? skate kids who actually dont skate but read comics?one of the most stupid comics i have ever seen."
5,Cliff's Notes to the JFK assassination theories,"some drawings may seem cartoonish, but the actual literature of this book is good.it covers over 20 of the major assassinations theories, not in great detail, but just an overview, like Cliff's Noes.good book that covers the Warren Commission, Ford, the FBi and CIA, Cuba, Oswald and his life, just an overall good book.if you want all the details and names, then get the actual JFK book like Crossfire by Jim Marrs.if you a summary of the theories like Cliff's Notes, then get this book."
3,Cool episode.,This is a good one. Very creepy entity that lives in the cellar. Freaked me out. Good story too. I hope this series goes on for many years.
3,hum,"not the worst but for shure also not the best episode of the show.the story is quit interesting but probably would result better in a full feature film.the monster is great, Lori Petty is a fantastic mother, but the girl isn't very convincing."
1,TOO SHORT!!!!,"This movie was Trash, It wasn't even an hour long and it wasn't scary. The only scary movie i have seen from the masters of horror so far is Penny Dreadful, and thats it!"
2,Not so scary,"I guess I bought this movie because I thought the picture on the cover looked cool. I know..... ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" well, that certainly applies to this movie.I'm always looking for a new horror flick that will scare the heck out of me and I can just keep looking. I guess the story line isn't too bad, but the acting......really,really bad ! The actors/actresses seem decent enough, maybe they were rushed through the scenes or something ??There are some good parts, although they seem to have slipped my mind at the moment. Did I mention the bad acting? Actually, the young girl and boy(who were in the basement) did fine, well..OK. It was the mother and father that needed acting lessons, or maybe the director needed directing lessons(?) This really took away from the plot and any chance of it being scary."
4,"Worthy entry from a debatable ""Master of Horror""","This has turned out to be my favourite ""Masters of Horror"" episode. Compared to names like John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Dario Argento, I was all ""who's William Malone?"" He did ""House on Haunted Hill""? ""Feardotcom""? Bah! Neither impressed me. How can Malone be a ""Master of Horror""? And then he wowed me with this episode. It's demented, gripping and I'm drawn in completely to this story. I loved its twisted happy ending!"
1,Lame,"What a collosal waste of paper. I felt ripped off after a few pages - and totally pissed off after sludging thru the whole book in just over an hour. Incorrect terms and poor translation help perpetuate incomplete and inaccurate concepts. Weak, limited, Euro-centric research. Poorly organized. Book design is sophomoric and pretentious. What a mess."
2,"Do Not Buy, Unless You Are a Real Estate Mogul","I bought this book because I thought it would tell me more about ""Playing Monopoly with Real Money"" and it was $1.50. After trying to read the few chapters that I thought would be interesting, I found that it is really geared toward ""Planning Decisions"" and Large Parcels of land type of deals. (Commercial types). Not really for a novice, very boring. (especially from a 1980's book)."
2,On Vtech phones refurbished isn't always refurbished,"The ringer volume on this ""factory refurbished phone is not adjustable. It's supposed to be but isn't. The volume is stuck on high, which is too loud for a bedside/nightstand phone. The phone is defective. I would bet anything that this is why it was returned by the original buyer to begin with and Vtech never repaired it, they just resold it. I have bought other refurbished products over the years, computers, scanners, etc, etc, and only had this happen one other time. the other product was yet another vtech cordless phone (different model). Their new phones are great, but avoid their refurbished products, they are a scam. If you research what I'm saying on line, you'll find too many others have had my experience for this to be just coincidence."
1,doesn't ring,the phone wwas cheap priced and i read the reviews and bought it but mine doesnt ring so now i have to get another one. not happy
3,good phone for about a year,"the model i bought had interchangeable face plates. i even found software online to program some of my own song choices for rings. i had this phone for about a year before i had my landline service disconnected and went mobile-only.about a year after that, one of my family members needed to borrow a cordless for a short period. i charged this phone up & took it over to their house only to find out that my vtech didn't work anymore. i was extremely disappointed. especially since i paid close to $50 for this phone (i bought it when it first came out). i hope the newer models are more durable."
4,Leslie knows her thing,"I have had many of Leslie's workouts ever since she had them in VCR tapes. I had a three mile one, but I gave it to my mom. I am planning to purchase a 3 mile dvd once I have two more weeks of my two mile. I will be taking her suggestion that if anyone is doing the 12 week program, progress every four weeks to another mile. I started with two miles, because my experience with the one mile goes way too fast and I feel like I hardly did a workout. Leslie is always upbeat and you need someone that has a positive attitude always."
5,Great workout,"I have several of Leslie's workouts. This one started off easier than I thought. But, the Pilates were great. Sure felt those. Good edition to your Leslie library."
5,Lose pounds with Leslie!,"Great workout! I've lost 24 pounds so far using Leslie's workout. She has some new moves, easy to learn and as always Leslie is so encouraging. She knows when your tired or about to give out of breath by her cues."
3,Leslie Sansone: Walt at Home - 3 Mile Slim & Sleek Walk Plus Pilates,"This DVD is defective. It is missing the whole Pilates mat segment, which is why I purchased the DVD. Othen than that, it's a great DVD, but I'd rather have the complete program. It's the only Amazon purchase that I've been disappointed with."
4,The variations are nice,I enjoy doing this workout when I get home from work. She does include a couple new steps in this dvd. I hope she will continue to make these different types of walk dvds.
5,A little different,"This is my 10th Leslie CD as I have been using Walk At Home for about 5 years. This is my very favorite CD! It is a little different since it adds some variations to the basics. Leslie's giggling and constant chatter in some of the earlier CD's really bothered me, but there's not very much of that in this one. She is friendly but not silly. The instruction is very good although I could not tell if forgetting to stretch at the end was for real. I really enjoyed the Pilates segment, also. I highly recommend this CD!"
4,Leslie Sansone Walk at Home-3 mile slim and sleek walk plus pilates,"The walking exercises are very easy to follow and give a great workout. The option to do the exercises without sound is helpful because there is a lot of chatter about pilates, and apples for the filming crew. It is Ok the first time but gets irritating after the 3rd time through."
4,Sony FINALLY does right by Dance/Club music fans,"Thank you SONY Records! You've partially renewed my faith in the big wheels that are behind the commercial music business. A great CD collection at a bargain price.There are so many guilty pleasures and great remixes on this disc, many have yet to be released in CD format until now. If your a fan of club remixes of pop songs you will love this collection. Some of them are a bit dated, so you might have to be a fan of the genre to fully appreciate what this compilation is.Here's to hoping they give the folks who dreamed up this release a promotion so that they can work their magic again. There are still many missing remixes from the vaults of Sony artists. This should become the first in a series of releases that finally gives us all the great mixes that have been commissioned for artists on the Sony Records roster."
1,Total Rip-off and misrepresentation,"21st Century? Nonsense! FM 23-10 was issued on August 17, 1994. That is over 12 years ago. I had this same exact manual on CD-ROM along with many more military manuals that came FREE with a computer war game.Shame on Amazon for not checking the origins and date of this charade. The copy quality is terrible and there is absolutely no value to be had.Phil Zimmermann, JD"
5,Great for Little Girls,I bought this keyboard and mouse for my granddaughter at 4.5 years old. Her little fingers fit perfect on the keys. She started learning correct hand and finger positions right after she received it. She and I are very pleased with this product. I can see anyone with small hands finding this keyboard very comfortable to work with. I give this product the highest recommendation.
1,Poorly written book on a great topic,"As a new attachment parent I decided to read ""everything"" out there. I sure want my money back. Amazon should indicate when books are self-published. I feel cheated. This is such a poor work on a great topic. There are writing errors on every page. The book is also poorly organized. Claims are left unsupported by research. Although I agree with the author's supportive statements about attachment parenting, her style of sweeping generalizations and no supporting evidence would leave many readers to think there is no research supporting her claims. I find it very hard to believe that the positive reviews posted here aren't simply fabricated. Parents interested in attachment parenting should read the works that have been published by actual publishers. They are of a much higher quality and than this self published work."
1,Typos typos!,"When I picked up this book, I'd already read Granju's ""Attachment Parenting."" In comparison, ""Every Parent's Guide. . ."" is very poorly written, less informative and frankly not very interesting. It *is* the only book I've come across so far that discusses non-circumsision (a topic more books should discuss!), but other than that I would recommend Granju's book instead. Unfortunately I didn't find that ""Every Parent's Guide"" had much to say that further informed or challenged me about parenting styles. Rather, it is a basic introduction to attachment parenting with elementary and sometimes poorly explained logic. I wish I could return mine!"
1,Terribly Written,I was extremely dissapointed with this book. I really think the book should be pulled from the shelves. The book is very disorganized and laden with typos.
5,Attachment Parenting,I found interesting information that will help me as I make decisions about parenting.
1,great subject - poorly written,"Whilst I believe very strongly that attachment parenting is the way to go, this book was a chore to read. The style is very poor and there are far too many badly researched blanket statements in it. Plus it is full of typos and grammatical errors. To be quite honest, i wish I had spent the money I paid for this book on something else. The author should be ashamed of herself."
3,Too Small,"These boots are fairly sturdy, however, they run a size to a size and a half smaller then they are listed at. The laces are short, and don't stay in place when you take the boots off, so you have to re-lace them every time you put them on. The zipper does little more then help you get your feet into the boots easier."
4,knee high boots,"These boots look great, though they run a little small in the sizing. Size 10 is much closer to a Size 9 or 9 1/2."
4,Good Look at Mayor Daley's Last Year,"This is the second book by political reporter Len O'Connor (1912-1991) on Mayor Richard J. Daley (1902-1976) of Chicago, and this one concentrates on the mayor's political moves during his 21st and final year in office. The author suggests that Daley's keen mind had faded in the aftermath of his 1974 stroke. We see how the Mayor made several strikingly bad political moves in that election year (1976). To begin, the mayor paid little heed to the rise of Georgia's governor Jimmy Carter during that year's presidential primaries. Daley also opposed a black Congressman (Raplh Metcalfe) who dared protest against police brutality, backed a talented yet doomed candidate (Mike Howlett) for Governor, and was unable to win the state's electoral votes against the Republicans. We also get a highly engaging look at the Mayor's last hour on earth (in the initial chapter) as he was felled by a heart attack a few days before Christmas."
4,Combines engineering theories and historical data,"Summarizes both aeronautical theory and historical performance data for many of the tasks involved in creating one's own aircraft design. Covers wing area and configuration, powerplants, landing gear configurations, control and stability, spinning. Finishes with a series of example problems which form the skeleton of a design effort. Stresses a realistic approach to design, demanding that the design goal be well stated before proceeding to decisions regarding the details. Discusses necessary assumptions and compares results of calculations with past aircraft designs. A good reference, at a fair price"
4,"enormous, decent quality","i bought this tarp to protect our patio furniture during the winter months. i've used it one winter. it kept the furniture dry. it's not a really high quality tarp. it seems like it would tear fairly easily, and it seems fairly thin, but these are merely perceptions. i have not conducted any scientific tests or comparisons. but i can tell you it kept our stuff dry for one winter, and i play to use it again next winter."
4,Well priced tarp,"This is a well priced tarp and larger, 12 x 16,than several smaller ones I have. It's 5 mm thick. Nice and light to move around. Need to anchor if there is any wind. Durability is unknown. So far, so good."
1,Prematurely rusty,"Began to show rust spots after less than 1 year of use. Appears to be stainless steel, but is apparently lightly plated mild steel. Spend the money for genuine stainless or an adequately plated version."
4,Nice,"Maybe this style runs a little bigThey flop around a bit on my feet (size 10), but they are comfortable.My main concern is how badly they smell. They came with this strange, organic smell....and I am embarrassed to think that people smell it sometimes..."
4,Great photographic guide!,"If you love marsupials, check out this book! It's fairly comprehensive, with photographs for nearly every species.The only thing I dislike somewhat about this book is it's small, narrow ""field guide"" format which means that it's a little awkward to actually sit down and study, and many of the photos are too small to be used as anything but a basic visual reference.Nevertheless, anybody who collects photographic field guides, likes good pictures of animals, or wants to learn more about Australian wildlife should pick up a copy of this book."
4,great addition to any kitchen...not just for dieters!,"i just bought this cook book to accompany the quick and easy south beach diet book. most of the recipes are quick in this book as well, and it gives a nice variety in each category. if you are hardcore on the diet, or just looking for some healthier alternatives, this cookbook is nice. we have found that everything we have made so far does not taste like it came from a ""diet"" cookbook. do'nt let this fool you into thinking that the recipes for muffins, pancakes, and sausages are going to taste like the real thing. these are alternatives to the real thing. we are using wheat flour, oat bran, turkey bacon and sausage and they taste like just that...wheat flour, oat bran, turkey bacon and sausage. these are meant to be a healthier alternative, not an exact replica of what's bad for us to eat! as long as you keep this in mind, this cookbook is great. the main entrees are much better than the breakfasts because there are less ""replacement"" ingrediets."
4,Breakfast for six?,"Everything that I have cooked so far using this book been excellent. The peanut butter stew is delicious and didn't taste like peanut butter but like something that I'd never eaten before and can't wait to eat again. My ""HOWEVER"" is that the recipes that I have tried make way too much food for two people; I'd like to know if anybody makes breakfast for 6 on a regular basis."
4,Good recipes for South Beach diet,This book gives you other options that fit with all phases of the south beach diet.
4,Worth Reading,"Good follow-up book to the original South Beach diet, with many recipes of tasty dishes. -- South Beach Diet has been on the top of bestseller lists for a few years now. However, in view of the recent critiques of Atkins low carb diet, I think that it is better to consider other approaches"
4,Great book for those who are trying to monitor their diet.,"The South Beach Diet cookbook has many helpful suggestions for meals based on the South Beach Diet. The diet is separated into three different phases and the cookbook has menu ideas from each phase to aide the cook in meal planning. I have not been a person who liked the idea of diets in general. They seemed so unnatural. The South Beach Diet is designed to encourage people to incorporate meal planning for every day, not just on ""diet"" days. This book allows anyone who wants to eat healthfully to be able to do so on all days!"
5,The South Beach Diet Cook Book,"The delicious receipes make it very easy to stick with the program and the colour codes for phases 1,2 & 3 with the nutrient breakdowns simplify the process. I love it!"
3,50/50 Chance,"I have been on the diet for about one week. I too had to tag recipes that were appropriate for Phase I since it is not organized. So far I have had about a 50/50 chance of trying a good recipe. Most recipes have been just so so, not something that I would try again. One recipe, Salmon Chowder which claimed it would be creamy, I put down the garbage disposal! I also agree that it takes a lot of ingredients, or a lot of time to plan how to buy common ingredients for a week of cooking. Not sure if I am happy yet, I will keep trying for a week or so."
3,"Bland, Bland, Bland!!","Ok, I have been following the South Beach Diet successfully for over a month now, and plan to stick with it. BUT, this book contains recipes that are mostly bland, not to mention they always advise too much time for cooking the meats,which leave them dried out as well as BLAND. I found myself dousing most entrees with hot sauce to make them edible. I will say that the sauce recipes (South Beach cocktail, teriyaki & ketchup) were very helpful, and there are occasional OK recipes in here. All in all, one could find better recipes on on-line forums than in this book."
3,OK but not what I wanted,"The cookbook was not the one I really wanted. I found out that I wanted the ""quick and easy"" recipes. This one is more involved than I wanted."
3,Ok,"I was a little unhappy about this book. The middle part of the book when i opened it fell apart. There was a huge section in the book where the pages where not attached to the spine of the book. This made it difficult for me to go through it. The ad should have been a little more clear on this part. However, I do still use the book but not often very rare."
4,great book,While the delivery of this book was abnormally long-about 2 weeks from order to delivery-the book is definitely worth it. Great price.
4,Great recipes but...not so great on recipe organization,"I have been on the South Beach Diet for a few months now (and have lost 20+ pounds!) so I was eager for the day that this book would be released.I am happy with all of the recipes but was disappointed in the way they were organized. They are organized into different categories such as breakfasts, appetizers, side dishes, etc. which is wonderful but under each of these categories, they should have grouped recipes for each phase together.Bottom line: Great book but a little clumsy to use."
3,"Not so bad, not always so great.","I've been doing low carb for ages and checked out this book for some new recipe ideas. Most are easy enough to prepare. Some are keepers, some stinkers. My fave? Red Snapper with Avocado Salsa."
2,Waist of money,You just want an easy understanding and cheaper recipes . Something for the common man . Only found a few to be able to fix and have not used the book since
2,YUCK!,Not at all what I had hoped to read. A bunch of hype about an unrealistic way of life! WW is the way to go!
3,Good recipes but you have to find them,I have to say that this book has some good recipes although they are hidden among a lot of difficult and not so flavorfull foods. Most of the time I find myself modifying the recipes so that they will turn out better. However I really think the desserts are beyond help. I have tried 4 of them and they have all been duds. The book is a decent investment if you have the time to sort through the recipes and you have a family that is willing to experiment with sometimes not so good dishes.
3,Hit and miss recipes,"I bought this book because of the many vegetable dishes, not because I'm on a diet. The salads and soups are very flavorful and can be prepared as is - no adjustments necessary. The Hearty Minestrone, the Tomato Salsa with Avocado and Onion and the Quiche are terrific. However, some of the meat and fish dishes didn't turn out so well. The Chicken Paprikash is too watery, I liked the addition of broccoli, but cooking the for 20 minutes turns it to mush, while the chicken turned out tough. There are no side dish suggestions for these meals and the photos are misleading, for example a salmon dish shows a whole salmon steak in the picture as one serving when actually half a steak is a serving size. In other recipes I've noticed the cooking times are off. Overall, I'm excited about the use of the herbs and spices to perk up vegetables and low fat recipes and will be more cautious preparing the main courses."
3,Not to my liking,"A lot of the recipes are geared to people who crave sweets. As a diet cookbook, sugar has been replaced by artificial sweetners. I have a strict policy against using artificial sweetners. My other complaint is that the recipes are too simple and not very tasty. I wouldn't have bought this book if I'd seen it first."
2,Review for Kindle Version Only,"I own the hardcopy version of this cookbook and really like the recipes. I thought it would be convenient to own it in the Kindle version. However, there are no hyper-links to the recipes, meaning there isn't a fast way to jump to a specific recipe. I could have taken the time to bookmark or note each recipe, but it just didn't seem worth it. I returned the Kindle book for a refund."
3,Poor organization,"Recipes in this book are helpful in fighting boredom if you are following the South Beach Diet. However, it is poorly organized...recipes are grouped by types (appetizers, main dishes, etc.) but not by stages. I am currently in stage two...do I want to look at appetizers and desserts for stage three right now? NO! To solve the problem, I had to go through the recipes and flag the recipes I can use at this stage...very time consuming.As for the sodium issue, many products are available that are lower in sodium...as long as you are willing to accept lower in flavor as well..."
5,It's time to upgrade!,"We've been using the Brita pitchers for years and just recently upgraded to the Magnum. It's great to have that extra space--we've got clean, tasty water and we don't have to refill it as often. We keep it on top of the fridge so it's always handy--they say room temperature water is better for you!"
2,"Good for a start, but after a while....","I brought this Brita pitcher 2 Christmases ago, and have used it ever since. However, be warned, you might have the problems I have been having. Basically, the whole top of the pitcher is broken. The little plastic piece that you open to put water in the filter broke and fell off about 6 months after I got the pitcher. Now I have to buy a new one. So be warned and try not to handle the thing too roughly, because it can't take any abuse. Of course, it still filters water, but it's a hassle just to get it out of the 'fridge."
2,Get ready to get soaked,"If you have any water in the top reservoir of the pitcher, then when you pour water our, the weight of the water in the top reservoir makes the lid fall off and soak you in water. You have to hold one hand on the lid to prevent it from toppling over when you pour water. So, it is impossible to pour with one hand and hold the glass with one hand.I also agree with other reviewers that it is very messy and gets a lot of water on your refrigerator shelves.I gave it 2 starts instead of 1, because the filter makes tap water taste good."
3,An improvement over the original,"I've used an older version of the Brita filter and pitcher for over 15 years. Although the filter is the same with the new pitcher, I do like the larger capacity. I also like the hinged door on the top, which allows one to refill the reservoir without lifting the entire lid. I would like to see the manufacturer design a better flap over the pour spout, as the hinge on both the old and new pitchers often fail to open or close smoothly. This leads to an uncontrolled stream of water when one attempts to pour, causing spillage. That's my only (minor) reservation about this product."
4,good,"The brita is great. Holds a lot of water and the filter works great. Its a great way not to spend money on bottled water. The down side is the lid. The past brita filters I have owned all had a ""filter timer"" on the top to remind you that you need to replace the filter. This model apparently doesn't have one. Also, the lid part that you flip up to add the water is pretty flimsy. It comes off just about everytime I try to open it."
4,"Nice, but...","We have had this pitcher for a couple years. It is nice to have ""clean"" tasting water. My only complaint is the little flap that fits over the spout; a terrible design in that occasionally sticks. When it finally opens water comes rushing out and often ends up everywhere."
2,Major Design Flaws,"Brita filtered water tastes the absolute best but I could do with out the hassle of this particular pitcher. The flap on the lip broke on the first day because the points that hold it in place arer very tiny. However, the entire lid wantrs to fly off everytime I pour a drink. There is nothing securing the lip to the pitcher itself. Also, if you have recently filled the pitcher, don't bother pouring another drink until it has filtered entirely or all of it will spill out. Major design flaws make this item more trouble than it's woerth so after a month of using this product, I'm scouting for a betteer one."
2,"water tastes good, but watch out for the lid","The only thing I do not like of this pitcher is its lid. The lid is not quite sealed so that the water could leak from the back and wet your sleeve. Even worse, sometimes the lid fell off. You have to be careful while using it. Not recommend."
1,Water Water Everywhere,"This is the worst Britta container. First water leaks out the top near the handle when it's recently filled. Second, the cap does not fit tightly like in the smaller filters. When pouring, if you have water in pre-filtered reservoir, it leaks through the front to spill all over."
5,Brita,We were spending a lot of money on bottled water. Amazon reviews showed this was a great alternative.
3,Water tastes great! Pitcher needs some work.,"I've had my Brita Deluxe pitcher for about a yea and I would not be without one again. It saves me from the time, expense, hassle and waste of buying bottled water (the water that comes out of my tap is almost undrinkable due to it's taste). However, I have had some problems with this model:* Low capacityEven for a single guy I find that I am constantly refilling it* Filter falls outWhen I tip it over all of the way the filter comes out and forces the lid off* Carbon specksNot a big deal but the filters ""leak"" little black flecks of carbon into the water reserve and that bothers me for some reason* Not dishwasher safe* Filters are not cheapI just ordered the larger ""Ultramax"" size and I think that I will like it better. I'm not worried about mold since I will go through a gallon or more in a day and I will wipe it after prior to refilling it.Brita Ultramax Dispenser"
2,Disappointed - a dribbler,"I previously had a great Brita water pitcher and bought this one as a replacement (I accidentally broke the original). Thought this would be an upgrade but find that most times when it is used, water will flow down the pitcher from under the spout onto the countertop or wherever you happen to be when you use it and dribbles onto the shelf in the refrig. A poor design for the spout. Just proves an upgrade is not always an ""upgrade""."
1,Brita 10 cup Grand model Pitcher ( 60258 42556 on bar code),"After having enjoyed my original Brita Pitcher for many years Ithought I would try this new 10 cup model with digital timer built in reminding you to replace filters.This is an awful pitcher to use, simply tilting it allows the filter to just fall out allowing the unfiltered water to fall in to the filtered water whereas my old model it was snug and fit tight.I cant even believe Brita would release such a lousy pitcher. after reading the reviews it seems others have experienced exactly the same problem.Oh well its going back to the store where I purchased it and will be looking for alternatives to Brita products."
5,Don't believe the negative comments,"Don't believe the negative reviews. I was hesitant about spending the money because of the negative reviews about ""the black particles"" in the water. Those people complaining are either (1) using the filters for a longer time than they are supposed to or (2) not letting the filter soak for 15 minutes like the directions say.I let the filter soak for 15 minutes in a cup and didn't have a problem."
1,Top falls off constantly when I pour,"This pitcher has flaws! The top is warped and falls off every time I pour from it. Bummer! I contacted Brita, lets see if they replace it."
2,"Love the filter, buy the Brita 2-Gallon UltraMax instead","If you can spare a little more room in your fridge I HIGHLY recommend buying the 2-Gallon UltraMax instead. It is also by Brita but the lies flat on the shelf and has a easy to use tap. MUCH MUCH better for kids and anyone else who has trouble gracefully lifting 3 quarts of liquid with one hand (read: most everyone). With this design you simply open the door and fill using the tap. With the pitcher models, the tilt and weight tend to be awkward and I think spill or overpour about 30% of the time -- especially in the middle of the night. The Ultra Max hold about 2 1/2 times the water (less refilling) and costs only $3 more."
2,Get a Pur instead,"I had a small Pur pitcher already and was very happy with it, but I wanted a larger pitcher, so I picked this one up at Target. They didn't have any Pur pitchers and I assumed the quality was about the same...I was wrong. First off, the design of this particular pitcher is really bad. The lid doesn't fit on very securely; it tries to fall off all the time. Also, there is a little indentation that fills with the ""bad"" water at the top and leaks all over when transporting the pitcher from the sink to the counter. I used it for 1 month and the whole time, the cartridge leaked carbon particles into the top chamber. As for the taste, it was better than the tap, but I could still taste chlorine. It basically tasted like good tap water, but not as pure as I would like it. So, I'm back to my tiny Pur. I have to refill it often, but it tastes better and it doesn't spill when pouring or moving the pitcher."
5,This Brita is the Bomb,"All I have to say is that this Brita is one of the best purchases I have ever made. You can't put a price on freezing cold water on a hungover morning. I have two homes, one in LA and one in NYC, and I have a this Brita in both. The tap water in either place is not particularly good however the Brita removes the lead flavor and replaces it with tasty water goodness. In NYC, a large poland springs bottle from the deli (nice and cold) is about $2.25 on averages, so what's $25 for never having to leave the home for tasty water awesomeness. The perfect hangover remedy, while offering well needed hydration. Indeed the bomb!"
3,replaced broked pitcher,"I purchased this pitcher to replace one I had for years that had a broken fill cover. While it looks exactly like my old one, they have changed the design in a couple of ways that I do not care for. When you fill it, it takes longer to go through and when you pour it pours slowly. This might be ok for some but I don't like having to wait so long to fill a small glass for a drink. It just comes out too slow. They restricted the water flow too much."
4,Water Tastes Much Better,"This pitcher works as it is supposed too. It is quite large so I am not constantly refilling it. The only difficulty I have is that it leaks from the spout just a bit when I am pouring, so I am just very careful when I pour."
2,It's o.k. but........,"I really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that I'm not too happy about. The filter doesn't ""lock"" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher. It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth. The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this."
1,don't buy it,"It may hold 3 quarts of water, but if you fill it all the way, it leaks when you pour. Also, the manufacturer says that you shouldn't empty it all the way because you want to keep the filter in water. You're left with about a quart per refill. And the lid broke off when I accidentally knocked it with the faucet. Finally, when you get sick of it after a use or two, make sure not to vomit in it. I don't think think it can filter out the trust you had in brita."
5,From zero to heroes in three weeks !,A MUST BUY !!! This book is an excellent training guide for any youth soccer coach. I used the included training plans for my U-8 team and was blown away ! The drills are simple and entertaining. They progress incrementally and may seem not to be effective. But run a scrimmage (as recommended in the book) after the first 5 practices and you will be astounded. Your players will have developed muscle memory and quick reaction skills. You will develop a well-rounded team with a passion for the game ! And the parents will be impressed with the results of your coaching.
5,Excellent and fun training games!,"I had seen this book on the shelf at B/N several times, but never pulled it off the shelf, as I am not a 'Baffled Parent', but coach H.S., premier, travel soccer. I attended a clinic given by Coach Clarke, and a fellow coach showed me the book. Inside are GREAT games for kids to enjoy! This is what you're looking for, whether you're a first time coach, or a coach who wants to loosen up practice for the more serious players.On the back cover it states, 'Be the coach you wanted to play for'. Well here it is. Kids LOVE the games and they'll be showing up to practice running and smiling!5*'s aren't high enough. Also recommend the second book by Tom Fleck and Ron Quinn"
5,Heavenly Music!,"You will not find better quality chimes for the price. My neighbors love listening to them as well! I've purchased two more as gifts, and both recipients were amazed at the sound."
4,They work.,"These work very well so long as you have the Brita System that uses these. They last 4-6 months, regardless of how much water you run through them. Also, make sure you follow the directions during installation (run water for 5-10 minutes prior to use)."
3,"Replacement filters fine, filter unit not good",These filters are ok. Brita is a reliable filter brand. The on the faucet filter unit is not so good. The plastic attachment ring gets striped and it falls off the faucet. An expensive and frustrating proposition. I use a water pik faucet system and run that through a Brita pitcher.
5,Faucet Water Filter,This is the best water filter I have found also have a Pur but like my Brita better
4,indicator lights,"We have a distinct twang in the tap water of southern California (not in a good way) that is detectable in boiled pasta and becomes even more pronounced when it is used to make coffee. The on tap Britta filters make the water very drinkable and my coffee delicious. We have gone through two units and ~12 cartridges in 4+ years. It is plastic and gets a lot of use so, the base unit breaks every couple of years (like a lot of other things now days). In both units, the indicator light quit working after one cartridge (remained red after changing). Ignore it as a gimmik to sell the product and change the cartridges every 6 months or so. Nevertheless, it is a good product that does what it is supposed to do."
2,Wish we'd bought a PUR,"This system has been annoying since we got it. First, we needed to get a special adaptor for our faucet,after we tried for an hour to install it. They were good about sending it quickly, and it worked fairly well for a while. The connection loosens frequently and needs constant re-tightening. The light system worked with the original filter, but has never worked with the replacements we used, even though they were official Brita replacements. The filter light just stayed red the whole time, so we have to guess when to replace it. I've just replaced the filter and now there is no light at all. After we use up the replacement filters we've already purchased, we'll switch to a different system."
4,Clean Tasting Water!,"For years I have used faucet water filters. I will not drink water from the faucet unless I have one on. Even though my water company claims to have some of the best tasting clean water in the nation, I still use filters. It's better to be safe than sorry. The water has no chlorine smell or taste to it. Brita is the only company I will buy water filters from. I would have given it five stars, but realistically speaking, I don't believe any water filter can rid the water of all unhealthy contaminants."
5,brita,I have always liked brita. I have one in the kitchen and bathroom. I like that it tells me when I need to change. I also have the pitcher unit. Yet I don;t use that much anymore. It also works well.\Thank youGod Bless You
3,No comment,"Did not use the filters yet. Hope they are OK. The previous Brita filters do not last very long, need replacements rather often."
4,It's well worth it.,"If you drink water from the tap at home or work, I suggest getting an on tap water filter. It makes a world of difference. I got the new Brita filter which works fine and these replacement filters. They last a long time 3-4 months, which is good."
5,Brita Filters,"These filters save us from filling the landfills with cases of plastic bottles.They remove the horrible pink mineral components & nasty taste from our local water.Long lasting. Amazon beats Wal-mart prices, too!"
4,"Sleek design, not long-lasting","First off, let me point out that it's a bit frivolous to review these replacement filters. If you already bought Brita On Tap, then you have just two choices for new filters: white or chrome. For my kitchen, I prefer chrome.These filters are expensive and they only seem to last a few weeks before the green light turns amber, then red, indicating that a replacement is needed. Don't trust the light. Try removing the filter cartridge, shaking it, and replacing it. In my experience, this almost always makes the light turn green again. These should each last months of casual use (~1 gallon per day), not weeks."
3,replaced Brita pitcher,"We bought this filter for my parents who will only drink filtered water as their city water has a very strong chemical taste and smell. They were using a pitcher for all their drinking water so I thought that a faucet filter would be a nice upgrade for them. The installation was a little rough. It was difficult to get the threads on the faucet to line up and form a tight seal with the filter unit. Once everything was lined up, there were no leaks. The biggest drawback is that the flow of the filtered water is pretty slow. It takes several minutes to fill a coffeepot, but it's still faster than waiting for the water to drip through the pitcher. You can flip the switch to get unfiltered water which flows normally."
4,"works well, lasts long","This filter makes our yucky city water taste so much better! And the filter lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. Our water has a lot of minerals in it and I figured the filter would clog up quickly, but it lasted about three months!These filters are much cheaper than buying bottled water, are much more convenient, and there's less waste."
2,Doesn't last as long as expected,"After reading through various reviews, I was expecting that this filter will last for about 4 months (I'm not using too much filtered water besides for drinking). It only lasted about 1.5 months, and when I replaced it with the other one in the 2-pack, I found that the red lights flashed a few times also, indicating that the 2nd one is not functional at all. It was quite a disappointment."
2,skeptical,"I have been buying brita tap filter for years, its a good product and works great. The water tasts better and you can say that it filters all those unwanted minerals by tasting. The one I buy from walmart had good life and better taste but the one from amazon has short life and does not taste the same. I have no clue why. The last one I used died in 3 days (orange light flashing).Conc: Its a good product but I'll buy from some other store tham Amazon."
1,Light on filter never turned green,Since the light should turn green eventually on a new filter I have no other option than to believe that they are either defective or that they were sold to me under false pretenses.
2,Brita filters loose in Brita box,"I received my filters yesterday, Jan. 4th. The box it came in was not damaged but the Brita box inside was ripped and the filters were not secured. They were loose in the box. I was not happy to see how this Brita filter box was sent. I don't know if they are damaged. I have not used the filters yet. Bonnie"
2,Appears used,I love the Brita On Tap system and have been using it for years. My dismay is with the seller -- when the filters arrived they were just knocking around in a box without the packaging that comes with new ones. The product wasn't advertised as used.
5,A++++++++++++,"Thanks, I am verry happy to learn about Brita Filter.We can drink safety and clear water.Thanks again."
1,poor delivery,I must say to save a few bucks from the local hardware store it's not worth the waitfor this product to be delivered. Ordered this product and took over 10 days from order dateand still not here.
1,not quite accurate though correct,not in a 2-pack but was two separate packages of slightly different vintage though correct model number
2,Brita on tap water filter,"Brita On Tap Water Filter. I recently purchased this product. The installation instructions read that installation is easy. I tend to disagree. The tower part of the filter does not allow you to turn the faucet adapter because it is in the way of the spiket. You can only turn it so far. Plus, the adapters that came with it do not fit my spiket and I've called Britta requesting additional adapters. What I question is if Britta Company knows that additional adapters may be needed why don't they include them instead of making the customer call in. I've tried to put the Filter back on so many times that the screen inside the part that mounts to the faucet has loosened and I need a new screen but cannot locate one. I would not purchase this item again and do not recommend it. Try Culligan. I have a shower head by Culligan and it works great. I love it!!JL"
2,This filter allows poisonous Sodium Flouride,"This filter is descent but does allow ""Beneficial Flouride"" through. Flouride added to the tap water is a deadly poison. Watch the ""Flouride Deception"" on [...]. The Flouridation of water is one of the biggest Cover ups in the history of the world and a crime against humanity. Cancer is one of the main results. Check into it. By a flouride filter!"
4,"Brita On Tap Replacement Filters, White, 2-Pack","I have used Brita filter system before.These filters are good.These filters do not last as long as stated, but the water is great tasting.The price on Amazon for the two pack is very good."
4,Brita water filter replacements,The product works fine. It's handy to order four so I have a replacement at hand whenever I need one.
4,John's Brita Review,Does not leak like the competition. Filters are inconsistant in how long they last. Satisfied with them.
4,Cheaper Water,"Cost effective, effective filters. Don't waste money buying these in big box storesStop drinking unhealthy bottled water.Works great on my kitchen faucet when others would not."
3,Good price.,"We purchased these on Amazon instead of at local retail stores (which cost more). Oddly enough, the light burned out shortly after installation. We contacted Brita and were told the light isn't necessary for the cartridge to function, just to change it in about 4 months."
1,LOOSE FILTERS,"BEWARE, they'll send you LOOSE Filters not WRAPPED. AMAZON'll refuse to understand the difference between LOOSE and WRAPPED, if you complain they'll send you loose again until you get sick of it."
5,Simply the best money can buy!,"I won this in a raffle, I at first tried to sell it but with no takers at half its value. I decided to keep it. What an excellent machine!! It simply makes the best coffee, espresso and cappuccino you have ever had! Not to mention it saves me 20 minutes every morning! (No more trips to Starbucks for my daily cappuccino fix) If you can afford this machine buy it, it is well worth the price!"
2,Sent for service twice,"After two to three months use the machine has clogged and had to be sent in for service. Clogging seems to occur after the message displays to clean machine with the tablet. After doing that, the trouble starts. When it is working it makes great coffee. Don't seem to get answers on how to fix it myself. They just tell me to send it back. Then I am without it for two to three weeks. The local rep has tried to be more helpful than Capresso customer service. Has anyone else experienced this problem?"
2,"Mechanically excellent, but...","The Metric is fine, but there are no foot makers! Just one continuous count of inches from 1 to 192 inches. At the 12 inch marker there should be an arrow pointing up and a 1F above it. At the 24 inch maker the same, on and on until the end of the ruler. 16 inch centers should also be in red with an up arrow, but is in black, the same as the general numbering system, with a tiny diamond above the number. Obviously no quality control at Stanley anymore. Oh well."
1,Didn't work for me.,"Sorry, but this one didn't work for me. It seemed as if Sarah and Cole spent the entire book playing cat and mouse games. Also, Sarah was rather immature in her expectations of Cole and her sister. But what I found the most disturbing was how Sarah jumped into bed with Cole so quickly with no thought whatsoever of birth control. Unplanned pregnancies (not to mention sexually transmitted diseases) are not always so welcome in three-month old relationships."
2,Very dated,"While this book appears to be one that may have been useful some time ago, it has suffered from what all computer books suffer from... it is no longer relevant. Somebody wanting to try to understand their son or daughter would be best off looking elsewhere to try to learn something, or they run the risk of using outdated terminology and getting a dated understanding of an industry that has changed radically since the book's publication."
5,Perfectly Pumpkin,"Wanted a Halloween toy for my German Shepherd that wouldn't get torn apart before the holiday was over. This pumpkin was great! It said ""trick or treat"" and didn't drive me too crazy. Every time someone came over she would squeak it until they gave her a treat. Needless to say Harley LOVED her pumpkin and it is still in almost perfect condition for next year."
1,A Loser,"A complete waste of time and money. The oils released from grating the herbs cause the grated herbs to clump and they remain in the grater. I took a handful of basil and oregano and absolutely nothing came out of the grater. You will need a knife to pick the wet clumps out of the grater and they are unable to be used in your recipe. Stick with the tried and true knife to chop, mince or just tear apart by hand."
2,Only works on dried herbs,"I have had no luck mincing fresh herbs in this thing. Like others have said, the leaves get stuck in the blades and must be dug out. If you watch the video a reviewer posted, you'll notice that only a couple little pieces drop out after about 15 cranks. The rest is all stuck in the blades, a wet mashed up mess. Sorry. But that's the reality of this mill. If you had dried leaves, it work work better. But then, you can just crush dried herbs in a mortice for small bits or in your hands for larger bits."
1,Why do I still own this?,"I've had this herb mill for 10 years after receiving it off my wedding registry, and frankly I'm surprised they are still selling it. I thought it would make the tedious task of chopping fresh herbs much easier. Well, it doesn't. Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and caught on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking. I end up getting out scissors and just using those instead. Don't bother with this...at least for fresh herbs. I guess it might work to chop dry herbs into smaller bits, but I can usually do that with my hands."
1,This Item Sucks,Herbs are not chopped as advertized. The product ends up in the blades in a mushy state. I needed to use a toothpick to put the ingredient into my salad.
5,"Good interview with Sayles, strong shorts collection","I've seen a few interviews with John Sayles and for the most part they are pretty stiff. This was a really insightful interview combined with footage from his last film and behind the scenes footage. The short films were great too. Really liked More, which is an animation that was done for 70mm IMAX screens set to a New Order soundtrack. I'd seen it online at IFILM, but needless to say, it's way better on DVD. Check out Catholic School...it's a hilarious documentary about school kids and their views on God, marriage, love, and lunch."
1,Nothing new here,"This is actually not a terrible book; it's just not a book for someone who has already been researching and reading up on how to heal a broken heart after a betrayal. I bought it expecting some new insight and/or advice, but mostly it's a ""beginner's primer"" that defines betrayal, looks at childhood and how this figures in, etc. Very elementary, very basic. If you're just starting down the road to recovery after betrayal, and have not spent years talking to a therapist and reading books about it, as I have, then this particular book is probably a good place to start. Just don't expect any concrete advice or specific direction. It just isn't here."
5,Comforting to read,"Almost a year ago, I was the target of mean girls who had grown up...actually, in their 60's, believe it or not. It was in a work environment I had flourished in for 16 years, and never expected to have people turn on me and then not even provide an explanation why. Reflecting back, I realized that there was a ""Queen Bee"" (by her own admission) who recruited others to buy into her venom and viciousness, and when one friend stood up for me, they drove her out as well.It was a terrible learning experience, and this book helped me to work through my feelings and better understand the dynamic that caused this to happen. If you've ever been betrayed by people you thought were your friends, this book can help you soothe your pain and realize you are not alone."
3,Watch box review,Clean well made box. I wish the slots for the watches were made slightly larger and the cushions that hold the watches were made slightly smaller by about 1/3 to 1/4th an inch.
3,Second watch box by Tech Swiss,"I previously received a watch box that holds 5 watches with an all wood exterior and the quality was outstanding. I bought this one as a gift for someone and figured the price was good for a leather exterior but when it arrived the leather was either some sort of synthetic material or a very, very thin cheap form of leather.. I'm in no ways a leather expert, all I know is it looked like it wasn't cut to the proper length in certain corners. Looked like two pieces of leather that overlapped and were glued together rather than sewed at the seams. The quality of the interior was up to par with the other box I have so I had no issue with that. Overall from the top/front (where most people will be seeing it) it looks great, its just when you pick it up to inspect it and look in the opposite corners where you may think they paid less attention when making it. I would recommend one of their wooden boxes instead."
4,Very good choice!,"I purchased 2 different watch boxes to see which ones was best and this one was the definite winner. My boyfriend has had it for over a year and uses it daily with no wear and tear and holds almost every watch perfectly. For the watches with the thicker bands in combination with larger faces it is a close call, but he has some pretty big watches and it is no problem at all. It also looks very nice and kept on the night stand. As a matter of fact, he needs an additional one of these soon!"
5,Fits a wide variety of watches.,This is a great quality watch box! Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves that it fits even his biggest watches and looks great in his room.
5,Very nice,I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He collects watches and really loves it. It looks nice on a dresser and the pictures don't do it justice. It's a good item to have.
4,Nice Case,"Looks nice in my room. Love this case, purchased for husband who has been collecting watches and it is a very nice place to keep them and also put them on display!"
1,Poorly done mish-mash,"This book is visually confusing, because they don't print the artwork the way it was in the comic book, they make a montage of a bunch of different panels with photshop, so there's always parts of pictures laying over other pictures, and they don't relate. They do the same thing with the writing, so you can't follow what they're saying, like a cut-and -paste job. Real ugly graphics. I used to love comics in the '60s and '70s, but they hacked them up and tried to make them look like modern comics where your eye can't tell where you're supposed to look. Just a hatchet job by somebody who went crazy with photoshop. And no good history of the comics or creators, either, just tiny short blurbs, which seem more like one-liners. Very disappointing. I'd rather read re-prints of the comics themselves."
5,Must have for potatoes,Used this for the first time this Thanksgiving. All the cooks wanted to try it out on our potatoes and everyone loved it.
3,a disappointment,I've had the product for more than two years and have only used it twice. It is VERY small. The handles hurt my hands. Only a small portion can be squeezed through at a time. I don't plan to use it again. Sure would love to have my money back.
1,BEWARE!!!,I ordered one of these with great anticipation but when I got the ricer it seemed fine then when I open and closed it a few more times it started binding badly. I returned it for an exchange and when it arrived it too was binding after open and closing it. I notified Amazon customer service that they may have a bad inventory of ricers but they responded that I should contact the manufactuer....I returned it and I guess I'll buy it somewhere else. Cuisipro is a very good manufacturer and I'm sure Amazon just got a bad shipment of ricers. Amazons return process is pretty painless so give it a shot but I wish they where alittle more receptive to my warning.Updated 11/5/05: I re-ordered the ricer awhile ago and it works great. I guess I initially got a bad batch. I can't seem to change my rating to 5 stars.
4,Spaghetti Eis,"I use the potato ricer at school in my German class room. German ice cream parlors offer ""Spaghettie Eis"". We re-create it with the ricer. Softened vanilla ice cream is squeezed into a bowl to resemble the spaghetti, topped with strawberry topping for tomato sauce and white chocolate shavings or coconut flakes for the parmesan cheese. It works well, my only complaint is that after the tenth or so serving, the removable disk starts sticking to the plunger and has to manually be dislodged-something that's fine in my kitchen. But in the class room I'd prefer to not touch the students food with my hands."
5,Make perfect mashed potatoes every time!,"I believe I've found the key to perfect mased potatoes! Now, I can't promise yours will come out perfect too, but this sturdy ricer will go a long way to improving yours. This ricer is sturdy, 18/10 stainless steel and built to last. It comes with three interchangeable stainless steel discs for fine, medium and coarse settings. The fine one is my preferred potato mashing disc. No more gummy, mushy mashed potatoes with this kitchen tool. The potatoes come out light and airy without breaking down the structure the way conventional mashers can. This has quickly become one of my favorite kitchen tools.Very highly recommended!"
5,Doesn't get any easier than this,"I bought this for my 2002 dodge Dakota. I didn't feel like fiddling with wires, spicing etc..Install was a snap, less than 15 minutes and you're done. Works well and so far no problems."
1,"Inept is too ""ept"" a word!","I agree with everything the other reviewer says about this composition (or is it a decomposition?) ... except that I think the better rating is ""1"" rather than ""5"" stars!Explore this piece AYOR!!"
1,"Tribute, Not!","I accidentally ordered this CD thinking I was ordering Tommy James' recordings. My own fault. Listened to 4 tracks and it was all I could take. This had to be done in a garage by kids learning to play their instruments that could not afford the much needed voice lessons. If there was a no star rating, it may be appropriate."
5,AMAZING saga,"This story begins in 1905 with two Jewish families, one Austrian, one Russian, immigrated to Manchester, England. The entire five-book series follows their descendants to 1990. This tale is riveting and filled with ups and downs as such subjects as infidelity, infertility, intermarriage, eating disorders, homosexuality, murder, etc. etc. affect the family along with history's tides. Buy Maisie Mosco's books, you won't regret it!"
3,"Great product, TERRIBLE company","My children and I have severed heat induced rashes on the neck and upper body. This cream works wonders on our skin. Two applications and it is cleared. We only have to use it sparingly in the summer.The companies shipping policy is terrible in my opinion. I purchased 2 of a special package deal (2 creams, 1 moisturizer, 1 bar of soap for $49.95). They charged me $9.95 shipping and handling on each package. That was almost $20 shipping and handling. Both packages came together in a $1 envelope with a $4.95 postage sticker (USPS). A rip off in my opinion.At least I have plenty of the product now so I won't have to shop with them again, EVER."
1,Did not work for me at all,I used the entire jar and would put on before bed and I saw no difference. My eczema was still there! So far the only thing that has worked is prescription Elocon but I am going to keep trying products for a non steroidal cream.This did nothing more than any other cheap hand lotion would do for me personally.The product seems to have rave reviews from the other Amazon.com users so my eczema must be especially stubborn!
1,New formula is ineffective,"I'd been using the original Freederm with hydrocortisone and antimicrobial for years, but because I only go through a jar so slowly (my eczema is very small, but inside my ear) I didn't know the formula had changed until I just received a new order a couple weeks ago. I've been trying to use the new cream, but it doesn't work at all, and seems to make the skin inside my ear crack and weep even more! The old cream was amazing, and the only thing that I (and the doctors) found would work, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. This new formula might be a good regular moisturizer, but it's not doing anything for my eczema. I'm trying to take advantage of their 30 day guarantee to return it :("
1,"so so cream, nothing for ezcema","the cream is water based, smell is not strong, not particularly pleasant. did nothing for eczema on my kids."
1,This is a waste of money,"I have been an eczema sufferer for 30 years. I tried this product as a last ditch effort as the testimonials and reviews were so promising. I have been using this product for a week now, halfs of the jar is gone and I have seen no difference whatsoever. Please do not get your hopes up. I am anxious to see how hard it will be to get my money back as I have read several times that the customer service stinks."
1,DID NOT HEAL AT ALL,"I bought this for my grandson, who has eczema, not a severe case but still has an occasional seasonal flare-up with it. Wanted to try something besides prescriptions, so thought I've give this a try. Waste of money, did NOT SEE any improvement, as a matter a fact it seems as though it made it worse. I even purchases the soap, moisturizer & creme. Waste of money."
1,Does not Work,Product does not work.Made my skin rash and burn!use Adovia Dead Sea soap instead much better helped me out than this product.
1,Product DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!,"I was diagnosed with anxiety induced excema. The itch was driving me insane. I purchased the product with great hopes after reading all the positive responses however after faithful use for two weeks, it has done absolutely nothing, its not even a good hand or body lotion. I feel like I was duped by a ""snake oil charmer"". DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,"okay, when did the REMOVE the cortisone?","First off, my review of this product seems to have been removed.Now, I see the product, since I purchased it, is available without cortisone?Oh.....things have changed.Anyone try the NEW one without Cortisone?If its still got cortisone, I am not risking using it on my child everyday and risking thinning of the skin."
3,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"WE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT IN JANUARY AFTER HAVING TRIED IT ON MY SON'S ECZEMA BACK HOME IN THE PHILIPPINES. I WOULD SAY THE PRODUCT DID WORK WELL AS MY SON'S CONDITION IMPROVED . HOWEVER ON MY SECOND ORDER (ORDERED 2 JARS W/C COMES W/ FREE SOAP AND MOISTURIZER)WE DIDN'T RECEIVED THE PACKAGE . I CALLED UP THEIR SUPPORT LINE AND WAS TOLD THAT USPS ALREADY DELIVERED IT. AFTER GOING BACK AND FORTH(FREEDERM AND USPS)WITHOUT OFFERING MUCH HELP, WE FINALLY GAVE UP. DISGUSTED FOR PAYING $59.90 FOR NOTHING, WE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR OTHER CREAM. RIGHT NOW WE'RE USING ECZANA(NO STEROID) AND ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS."
2,NOT THE MIRACLE PROMISED,"MY DAUGHTER HAS HAD EXCEMA SINCE SHE WAS 2- MILD TO MODERATE. I BOUGHT THIS PRAYING IT WOULD HELP, BUT IT BURNT HER SKIN EVERY TIME I PUT IT ON. SHE WOULD SCREAM AND CRY. I THINK THE BURNING DID MAKE THE ITCHING STOP- BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT. HOWEVER, I AM GIVING IT A 2 BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HAS THIS STRESS REACTION THAT ITCHES HIS ARM. HE SAID IF HE PU THE LOTION ON EARLY ENOUGH, IT WOULD TAKE THE ITCH AWAY. HE HAD NO RASH OR BROKEN SKIN, THOUGH.FOR MY DAUGHTER, IT SEEMS TO WORK TO MATCH CORTIZONE OVER THE COUNTER WITH EUCRIN CREAM IN THE TUB. IT IS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA- NOT THE LOTION. IT IS SUPER THICK AND CREAMY, AND DOESN'T BURN HER AT ALL."
5,Great Stuff!!!!!,"Freederm HC takes the red out of the rash within minutes of applying. It does not cure the rash. I have eczema on my hands, and this stuff works!"
5,A good product for all things intended,"Admittedly, my first one had a steamer problem, and was promptly replaced under warranty (I got it off eBay - it was a store demo model, soooo . . .) - I've had that replacement from Capresso for over 3 years now, and it's still making very nice espressos, continues to froth or steam milk well (though, I wish the arm was placed higher, but not a big deal) and it makes fine drip coffee. Programmability is certainly interesting, but I only go for standard shot sizes and otherwise use the timer to start coffee for morning wakeups. This is a very easy to clean and use unit - well designed in both regards.Sure, you can easily find more expensive, rather serious Italian espresso machines to complement a separate drip (or other) coffee maker - but, this has made satisfying coffee/cap/espresso, been very convenient and easy to use, saved counter space and has lasted well for me."
2,Great espresso - poor cappuccino,"This product makes very good espresso with the right amount of 'crema'. However, the milk steamer worked well for only 10 months and can no longer be used to make cappuccinos. I did follow the direcetions and clean it regularly but it still became useless."
4,Nice Mary Jane,"Runs true to size and not too narrow. These more comfortable than some other Clark Mary Jane styles. Appearance is a bit more chunky/casual. Looks cute with jeans. Great heel height for the ""too long pants"" but easy to walk in and very comfy. I love them.."
3,Soothing but did not help my allergic rhinitis,"Having used this product consistently for a month or so it definitely generates a soothing feeling. It also appears to work for cold/virus prevention, a few weeks into using it all of my roommates got sick and i somehow managed to avoid catching it (unheard of for me). Obviously this could just be happenstance, but worth mentioning. I bought this originally to help reduce nasal inflammation from allergic rhinitis-- and in that capacity i have noticed no improvements. Having tried almost everything to reduce nasal inflammation this has been the only product that works for me:North American Herb and Spice, Sinu Orega, 2-Ounce"
4,Ponaris great for winter sinus issues,My doctor recommended this product a few years ago when I began to have sinus problems. These seem to come in the winter.Ponaris helps tremendously with dry sinus and stuff conditions. I like it because it's a natural product and you don't develop a dependency on it.
1,Ponaris Nasal Emollient,"I use oxygen through a nasal cannula and my nose gets very dry and often bleeds. Members in my support group have mentioned this emollient, Ponaris, as being very helpful. After ordering, I tried using it several times, but not according to directions. Putting drops in nasal passages can lead to something called lipid pneumonia, so I just used a Q-tip and gently coated the area just inside my nasal passages. I found it not to be as effective as I was hoping, although I do like the fragrance. I would caution anyone who uses this to speak with your doctor first, as it could be very dangerous if not used correctly."
3,Nasal spray,Nothing special as far as nasal sprays go. I like that the product is made of mostly natural products instead of chemicals.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,This book was absolute nonsense. I am a woman who thought she might genuinely have something to gain from reading this book and was severely disappointed. The author is condescending and offers very little new information and an extremely unrealistic perspective on how to cope. The book flows poorly and several of the other books which Amazon[.com] lists as similar or related books are much more informative and worth reading.
1,Concerning,"Judging from the other reviews of this book, I guess you either love it or hate it. I fall into the negative camp unfortunately. There were parts that seemed distant and unrealistic. On the whole not a very moving book. There are plenty of other great texts on this topic to choose from. Don't waste your time here."
1,Unhelpful Read,"This book basically contains only one message, that is strung out over numerous pages. The sum total of the author's thoughts would fit on a 3x5 index card. Fortunately I bought another book on the same topic (but by a different author) and the other book has proven to be worth the money I spent on it AND the money I spent on this unworthy book combined! So I am not at a total loss..."
5,Excellent real Louisiana cooking!,"I'm from New Orleans and have been a weekend chef for years. This book rapidly became my favorite along with the cookbook from Antoine's. This book represents real Louisiana cooking, from all parts of the state. It is not a book of fancy, trendy, glamour food, but real Louisiana cooking at its finest. Emeril really has a true Louisiana soul. I had the pleasure of dining at Emeril's in the New Orleans warehouse district while he was behind the chef's bar with two of his chefs. They cut up, made jokes, drank shots, passed out food and drink samples. We all had a great time. He works hard and plays hard. That is the real Louisiana spirit. This book captures a lot of that spirit. Try the chicken and sausage gumbo, the red beans and rice, or shrimp and okra gumbo to start. You'll be hooked too!"
2,Pre-Hype Emeril,"A nice little book that brought back fond memories of the region. Look elsewhere for authentic recipes. This book is enjoyable for what it appears to offer: a brief glimpse into a unique culture and special cuisine. The current hype of Emeril doesn't mar this book. Maybe some people take the kid from Fall Rivers, MA seriously! He's entertainment, nothing more, nothing less.Don't buy this book until you've purchased real books on the cuisine; any or all of Prudhommes will give one's library a good foundation of the creole/cajun art of cooking."
4,Good Collection If You Don't Know Louisiana Cooking Basics,"These dishes are quite ordinary in Louisiana. Many are quick and easy to prepare. The clue is to use what you have on hand, and keep it simple. Experiment with what you think might taste good together. Unless you live in Louisiana, you probably won't be able to get many of these ingrediences fresh. Substitute what you can get--fresh is always better than frozen."
1,No good,"The recipes in this book were hard to follow, and the measurements came out all wrong. It was no good at all. I've lived in Louisiana all of my life, and the food in this book hardly resembled anything I grew up with."
1,"A chef? No, a joke.","Emeril is a joke as a chef. It is well known throughout the cooking world that he couldn't boil water to save his life. The recipes in this book are borderline insults to real Louisiana cooking. For someone who keeps repeating that cooking 'aint rocket science', his recipes are anything but easy. Is it possible for him to cook just one dish without using a ridiculous list of ingredients and acting like a moron? Doubtful. I've even been to one of his tapings. What a rip-off! The audience is reminded over and over when to cheer for something he has done. It is also told how to react when given little tidbits of some amazing dish he threw together. Most of it was absolute crap. What it looks like and what it tastes like are two different things. The man has an over-sized ego and very little talent. If you want real Louisiana cooking, look for a book from Paul Prudhomme or John Folse. Either of those could cook circles around this clown. This book is a total waste of money."
1,Real and Rusted,"Should have been Real and Rusted. I couldn't find one good recipe that didn't call for a three page list of ingredients. This is just not worth the money. And yes, there are people who don't like Emeril."
1,Lousiana cooking,"I've been to Louisiana, I've lived in Louisiana, I've eaten good Louisiana cooking, and this ain't it. I don't know what he's trying to prove with this book, but this ain't the way I've ever seen anyone cook. My family would be sick trying to eat this food. I don't know who Emeril is trying to be, but it ain't a cook."
1,Emeril is as Cajun as I am,"Emeril is neither real nor rustic and this cookbooks is a sham, too. He's from Massachusetts, people. Maybe you love his personality but please don't buy into the hype. Go get yourself some really good cookbooks like WHO IS YOUR MAMA? and/or the RIVER ROAD series and /or Paul Prudhomme's books. Those are the real deal, not this stuff."
1,This was embarrasing,"The recipes in this book made me sick. I tried them exactly the way they were written. It was bad. Watching Emeril on TV is painful enough, but I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. Sorry, I was wrong. This book should be discontinued."
1,Pork fat does NOT rule!,"As a Jew and a vegetarian, I find it completely unconscionable that Emeril would use his fame to profit from a book that pushes the virtues of pork fat. Doesn't he realize that there is a small minority of us out there that doesn't subscribe to his over-the-top method of cooking everything with pork fat, as well as other animal by-products? I've watched his show a few times, and got this book from a friend a few months ago. While the man has some talent, I find it really distasteful that he profits from his fame and over-hyped ego. I looked in vain throughout the book for a recipe that would be culturally and morally sensitive, but came up empty handed. This book is a prime example of the excesses of the capitalist system gone awry."
2,Expected more.,"9 months after occasional usage, the clip broke while I was trying to buckle my son in. The company won't do anything for me since it's past the 180 days so I'm SOL. Not happy! And also, the front wheel must be locked straight to jog or rollerblade with it, otherwise, it spins around and stops completely. spend the money and get something nicer!"
3,Did the job and was thrown away,"I was using this tarp to cover plastic bins and bags in my pick up while driving to another state (about 700mi). I used bunji cords to keep boxes and tarp in place. Upon arrival, I inspected the tarp and it had a quite a few wear and tear spots. Although it didn't rip apart and I was able to use it on the way back, it cannot be used anymore. Over all, I am satisfied with the tarp for it's price (very low price). I didn't expect it last long and it did the required job."
4,Feels thin but held up well,Like the other reviewer said it feels very thin but for the money and the size seems pretty strong and durable
3,"Dry Top 12200 12-by-20-Foot Full Finish Size Tarp, 5-Millimeter, 2.9-Ounce, Blue",I will call this tarp a one time or a throw away tarp. For the price and what I used it for it served its purpose.
1,Not even worth the time to order it - very thin and tears easily,Not even worth the time to order it - very thin and tears easily. We had to pickup the pieces that tore apart before they became airborne. We then bought a tarp from Harbor Freight which has worked well since then.
4,A difficult but brilliantly written novel,"Oe in "" The silent cry"" deals with the perplexing problem of finding ones root. The novel is a story of about two brothers who return to their village, each for their own reasons.The story deals with by the main characters search for answer to &#65533;how does a modern man communicate( in philosophical sense )?&#65533; One brother thinks, we can communicate by death and in our silence. The other wants to communicate by connecting his present with the past of the society.It is a difficult novel due to the hard subject matter. But Oe does SPLENDID job in expounding the difficult issues through his excellent narrative."
5,completely depressing and moving,"This is a story of repent. It's a glorification of Takashi'sself-destruction. It is absolutely ingenious that way thewriter develops this character Takashi, the incest, hisgrievance over his sister, his relationship with his brotherand wife. The reader is shocked on every turn of thepage"
5,Oe's search for himself,"I enjoyed this novel very much. It was writen in a style that I was not accoustemed to, but he accomplished what he set out to do. He wrote a japaneese book about a traditional family in an non orintal way.Not only did he find his own way in life but he helped to find his son's way in life. A very giffted writer."
5,My favorite Oe novel.,"I've only read three other Oe novels and this one is my favorite. It's also one of my favorite books in general and I'm an avid reader. It's a very mature book so I DON'T recommend it for a younger audience. As the other reviews say, it's dark and can even be painful to read at times. It's quixotic, brooding, bleak, and to borrow from another reviewer it does leave you unsettled and unnerved. However, it's also beautiful in an odd way... so if you're looking for something different this could be it. To summarize it, it's about two brothers who visit the village they were raised in. Although this may sound a little cliche the events and the history they discover are not."
1,Ann could've done better.,"When I read Mary Anne and the Haunted Bookstore, it was soooo boring!!! Don't waste your time or money on this book. It's just not worth it."
1,Go elsewhere,"If you're interested in contemporary American music that's actually worthwhile, avoid these two symphonies. Alternatively irritating and boring, this music (or is it mucus?) certainly won't hold your interest for long.Pay no attention to the ""important"" descriptive titles the composer tacks on to many of his works -- they're simply designed to spark interest where there would otherwise be none. (But I'm sure most conductors, players and audiences wouldn't be fooled for long!)"
5,Denise did a great job again!,I love the format of this book. I just got it & noticed right away how well it's set up & organized in such a time-saving manner which will prove to be more useful & effective. I love all of Denise's products.
4,B&B,"I was looking for a good book that utilized an exercise ball and bands after my husband and I had to drop our gym membership. I am glad to have found this book. Denise walks you through each exercise in enough detail to understand the movements, how to intensify the movements to a higher level, and the benefits to the target muscles. She offers encouragement from her own insights and from personal testimonies of others who have succeed using her exercise books. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase."
3,Denise Austin Sculpt Your Body,"Book is very detailed, but cumbersone to workout and read at the same time. I do appreciate the exercises however and will use it for quite a while."
5,Gotta buy the CD,"This book is awesome!!! He is hilarious. It's great to hear him tell his own story. This is true comedy, he may be a bit vulgar at times. Overall this gets 5 stars. He speaks from the heart and I respect that."
1,Terrible!,"I listened to this as a book on tape, read by the author. I liked Bernie and looked forward to listening to this. However, after the first few chapters I was bored out of my mind and after a few more, I was disgusted by his language and detailed references to sexual acts regarding his daughter. Of the four CD's, by number three, I threw the CD's in the garbage where they belong! I didn't laugh once - not even a chuckle. Spend your money on something more valuable - like dirt!"
4,Laughing at life when they say no,"Bernie Mac has done an excellent job relating comedy to real life. Aside from the ""I was so poor..."" jokes he also offers more realizations from real life that most people can relate to and can laugh at. Beware to those seeking new material from Mr. Mac this book offers very little (especially if you have seen ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") this book will, however keep you laughing from cover to cover."
5,A Bad hammajammer of a book!!!,"Bernie Mac's, ""I Ain't Scared of You"" is a very good read. I set down and read it in one evening and recommend it to everyone.(...)"
2,Bernie Mac could have put together a better book,I have been a big long time fan of Bernie Mac for many years now but this book is a disappointment.Bernie Mac has a great show on Television every week as well as some great movies but this book is not what I expected Bernie Mac to put out.The sentences in this book are put together like they are from a little kid just learning how to use english for the first time.Bernie Mac is still an Original King of Comedy and I will continue to be his fan and support him but this book is just flop he will have deal with in his career.
4,Great as expected!,"Received on time and as expected. These are very nice wind chimes and have a great sound to them. They are made well w/ no wood or string parts to rot away. I had a set of Pentatonic chimes yrs ago and loved them. Lost them in a divorce (lol) and have been dying to get another set. I did get a different scale this time, Chinese, and enjoy there light happy sound. I want to get a set of the Japanese chimes to go along w/ them but will have to save a little first. They are expensive but worth it!"
2,Disappointed in it,"This device is too flimsy to be useful. The back folds down under the weight of my not-very-thick method book. It is too narrow to hold two sheets of music side-by-side, the base could use a lip to keep music from sliding off. All in all, it is more trouble than it's worth."
2,Too much glorifying of Hardin here.,"While Blake is a premier writer, in this work he has chosen to glorify a deadly killer in a way that doesn't do history justice, but continues to perpetuate the myth of this man as hero. I live in the area of Texas where Hardin did many of his deeds, and myth already abounds here. We don't need a novelist to validate these misconceptions."
4,Pretty good read,"Not great literature, but a good casual read. It gives a pretty good sense of the life and times of JWH from the end of the Civil War until his death."
4,What Makes the American West Like Nothing Else,"There was nothing like the American West in the history of the world and figures like Hardin exemplify it; deadly, brave, sad and foolish all at once. His death seemed a relief because by 1895 there was no place left for the bravado of a gunslinger who would draw over an insult.I found the writing format, the telling through other's eyes, less engaging and certainly less tasty than Blake's current style."
2,flimsy,"I bought two of these: one for solar protection over my hottub and the other to cover a boat. They are very thin and difficult to position without ripping. And during the first week, one of the grommets pulled out with only slight bungee tension on the boat.Buy something better. These cannot withstand even light use."
1,cheap tarp,"I thought that this tarp was going to be heavier because it was brown/green, but it was as thin if not thinner that a cheap blue tarpe. Caution light duty tarp."
2,Good Book,"I thought this was a good read, not my favorite, but worth the price. I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Loved it!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the premise is far from original. The life story of a smart and spunky girl of humble beginnings who manages to make the best of it all has been done. It is reminiscent of Fair and Tender Ladies, a book I also loved. Anyway, the characters are memorable and the story details captivating. For me, it was hard to put down. Lee Smith rarely disappoints me."
4,Lee Smith Does it Again,"Lee Smith seems to do her best work when she writes in the voice of a spirited young girl, as she did in Fair and Tender Ladies, and travels with the protagonist on her life journey. This story is told mostly, though not completely, through Molly Petree, a young survivor of the post-Civil War South. With the help of a benefactor who was a friend of her dead father, she attends a school for young ladies. She later falls in love with a banjo-playing mountain man in the Appalachians Smith seems to understand so well. Though some reviewers seem to regard the book as bizarre and disorganized, I think that Smith's constant shifting of time and voice keeps the story interesting by foreshadowing future events. The characters are beautifully drawn, and it is impossible not to care about them. Smith can be uneven, but this is definitely her best since Fair and Tender Ladies. A great read."
2,disappointed,"We had just returned from a trip to Charleston and the South and someone suggested this book to me. Well, it was not to be. For one thing, I tire of this 'oh I found this diary, let me share it with you'. The college girl in this case was an unnecessary character, and the girl in the diary, well, she just would not have written the diary in this way. Her voice was false and way to old for a teenager. As other reviewers noted, there was much too much of the day to day doings in the plantation to really interest me. I skimmed much of the last section, got the basic gist, and decided that there probably are better books about Charleston in that time period than this one."
2,I don't get it,"This book had such great reviews, and the description looked so interesting that I had to read it. Wow. Maybe I am just missing something, but I didn't get it at all. The whole books seemed fragmented and bizzare. The main character never resonated with me, and frankly, the jumps in her life and personality didn't even make much sense to me. This will certainly be one for my ""sell it as a used copy and hope to cut your losses""."
4,On Agate Hill,"I have been waiting for a new book from Lee Smith for awhile now and she does not disappoint with her latest. It is the story of Molly Petree, a 13 yr old orphan at the end of the civil war. She becomes the ward of her Uncle Julius and is given a diary to write down all her hopes and dreams by the pastor's wife when her Aunt passes away. Molly leads a hard life and the story is told by her writings and also by others who come and go into her life. Molly is strong-willed and never gives up on her dreams. I don't think this book is needlessly contrived. It tells a story and a pretty good one at that. You wish more for Molly, but she manages to hold her own to the end."
5,A Good Read,Once again one of my favotite authors has written a novel about the South that gives me a vivid and exciting glimpse of how things were in another era. Her heroine is a woman with a mind of her own who doesn't mind taking the bitter with the sweet to be with the one she loves. I reccomend this highly.
3,Agate Hill,opeiI have only just started the book. I think because it is written as a diary i might struggle with it. I am hopeing the more i read on it will get better for me.
5,Mesmerizing Tale Of An Amazing Woman,"Lee Smith has hit a slam dunk with this book. I spent a week of long nights staying up reading this book but it was worth it. The central character Molly Petree is interesting unto herself but the other characters are vivid and really round out the story. I enjoyed every morsel of this book but I have to admit to being confused at the end when the true story of a murder was finally told. Perhaps the author wanted readers to decide for themselves what really happened. But not matter, read this book... you won't be disappointed."
3,"A tale of frustrations, would have been better with a little more lightness","The itinerant life of a professional soldier is a hard one for the entire family, and this is one such story told from the perspective of an army spouse. Moving to a different base approximately every three years, Miles chronicles the daily frustrations of trying to establish a stable home life while avoiding deep roots. As a college graduate, she was frustrated at the difficulties she encountered in finding a job where her degree was significant.The majority of the events described by Miles are on the negative side of the ledger, there is little in the way of happiness. Even the descriptions of her children are almost always expressions of the tedium of raising children. Although there are occasional glimpses of writing talent exhibited by the author, they are overwhelmed by the category of the events."
2,A Walk Through The Obvious,"This book will waste the time of any serious student of business strategy. The author is a journalist, who has put together a long string of news items, in ten categories, to fill this empty book. The result is a pastiche that offers few fresh insights or interesting conclusions. The writing style is glib and unsatisfying."
4,La indigerible crueldad humana,"Dicen que la Guerra Civil Española la perdio la Republica pero que la historia la perdio el franquismo. Prueba de ello son novelas como ""La voz dormida"" de la escritora Dulce Chacon, quien durante años se dedico a recopilar historias de mujeres que padecieron el regimen de Franco, para luego escribir esta historia en clave de ficcion sobre un puñado de presidiarias que aun terminada la guerra y decretada el fin de la Republica, fueron perseguidas y tratadas despiadadamente por el regimen franquista como enemigas de la Nacion.Algunas de las protagonistas de esta historia son condenadas a muerte pero otras logran sobrevivir para echar el cuento, esa sera su unica redencion.Chacon, quien murio pocos años despues de publicada La voz dormida(2002), endulza la novela con una historia de amor con final feliz y un poco de melodrama digno del mejor cine de barrio español, quizas como metodo para que el lector sea capaz de digerir la indigerible crueldad humana."
1,Don't bother.....,"This awl is very poor quality. The wood handle is not connected well to the steel awl and lasted less than a day. Don't waste your money on this, spend a little extra and get something that will last."
2,more clockwork than muse,"This was one of those books I bought in a fit of procrastination, hoping that just owning such a book might magically propel my dissertation towards its much yearned for end. The title sounded good too, you know, with the right mixture of creativity and discipline.It was an utter disappointment, I'm afraid. I've heard all the advice in it a million times before - there's nothing here that you can't think of yourself. Figure out when you like writing. Do mechanical stuff at times you're not as alert, and real writing when you're raring to go. Make an outline, divide it all into manageable chunks. Stick to it, pace yourself, be a tortoise not a hare. Make a schedule and keep it!There's not really much of the muse in there at all, is there? Of course, if this is the way you work best, sure, go for it, it's good advice. But you've probably already worked it out for yourself, haven't you?"
4,Clamshell case? That's one ridiculosly large clam!,"There's nothing really wrong with this case. However, you should be aware of what it is. Mostly, it's very large. It's the sort of case that would hold the ourageously large plastic framed type sunglasses you see on some women. Nothing wrong with that, but it's so large it barely fits in the dashboard cubby hole I usually use for my sunglasses. I can imagine that many vehicles will not have one large enough. Also note that the finish is shiny on this, like patent leather. The picture in use as I write this does not give you an appreciation for how large and shiny this baby is.If what you are after is a big, shiny case go for this one. The quality is good but not great. I guess that is what you should expect at this price."
2,Lasted only 6 months,"I have gone through several clam shell cases for my large prescription sunglasses. This was perfect except that I bought it in mid-March and by September the case no longer stays closed, flops open, is useless. Of all the many cases I've gone through over the years this one lasted the least amount of time. I use it everyday but this one didn't stand up like others have. I will be buying a different one this time around and don't recommend this one."
4,nice case,"inside lining is a bit on pinkish side, but kind of cool since I am a girl. Reminds me of victorias secret colors. Outside case is smooth black leather, not too shiny, more of a matte finish."
3,Glasses case review,I use it to store my ipod nano and some flash drives. It's a little large but does the job.
2,Not as advertised,Very large case. It measures closer to 3x3x6 (not 2.5x3x6). Could fit two pairs of my glasses in. Not good for carrying around in an already stuffed bag.The shape is different than the image displayed (there are odd flat parts to the case).I agree with the other reviewer. These are HUGE.
4,Perfect for large sunglasses,I purchased this case for my aviator sunglasses and they are just the right size. May be too big for smaller sports type sunglasses. The case is well-made and keeps my shades from getting crushed or bent in my purse.
2,College kids drink?,"Guess what: college kids drink gallons of beer, take copious amounts of drugs, have sex, and rarely go to class. Unfortunately, I summed the the entire book in that one sentence.If you have graduated from college within the last ten years, you are hardly shocked by what you will read. If you have not graduated from college within the last ten years and are surprised by what you read, you must have your head in the sand."
1,Duh...Hellloooo,"Uh, Barrett, what planet have you been living on these past 60 years? This is such a stereotypical old person's book about how the youth of today are going to hell in a hand basket. It's also got an air of ""I never did those things when I was in college."" Please! I'm a 41 year old male and your description of college now sounds almost exactly like my experience at Penn State in the early 1980's. So, spare us the alarmist ""revelations"" about college life, unless this book was intended to be some sort of vouyeristic quasi-porn expose of what those naughty kids are up to...then some might feel you have achieved your goal."
4,Can't go wrong with a classic.,They are just cool. They aren't for extra support or to make you jump higher or run faster. They are just plain ol' cool. Get them and love them and then reminisce a little about the good ol' days.
5,"Shamisen, past, present, and future","I just can't tell you how much I love this cd. I am currently living in Japan and first heard Agatsuma when he played on a variety show. I was totally amazed by the beauty of the music and knew I had to go out and find this disc. The power of traditional tsugaru songs and the beauty of his contemporary compositions are perfectly complementary. It's a great cd for thinking, reading, relaxing, or just quietly re-energizing at the end of a long day. Get this disc and experience the richness of shamisen music."
5,Funny (stuff)!!!!!!!! Greatest practical joke ever!,"OHhHH my FREakiN GodD!!!! GeT ThE %$#@ oUTTa MY kiTCHEN!!!Perry hits unnatural octaves when he loses his temper, which is like ever 5 minutes. Geez this joke is so wrong, but so funny. How can he not have a clue?Staged or not, he does get to star in his own movie. Everybody's in on the joke, except him. Hilarious! Poor guy asks for a stunt double, then realizes in utter shock his stand-in gets to have real sex with a hot Z-list actress. Aww, shucks! At least he also turned down the rimjob scene.Thanks kegrun! Greatest comedy/documentary along with American Movie."
1,not so much,"Call me crazy...but I hated it! Even though I REALLY REALLY wanted to like it!! : ( I couldnt even finish watching it. And Im all about being open minded..I mean I REALLY tried. No such luck. I bought it because Im a HUGE Dane Cook fan, and this was not typical for him..at all. Maybe it got better further into it..I dunno. Im sure there are lots of people that really enjoy this type of comedy. However, Im not one of them."
5,FUNNY!,"This is honestly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laugh every time I think about it. Don Barris is one of the funniest human beings ever. Try checking out the Ding Dong Show; if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out. And by the way, Don Barris and Jimmy Kimmel are NOT the same person. He does the warm-up for Jimmy Kimmel's show and if I remember right, he used to do it for the Man Show too."
5,"A metaphor for comedy, life","Windy City Heat is the type of movie that can't be explained. No, it can only be experienced. Place it alongside Fellini's 8 1/2 or holy scriptures, and they are revealed as vacuous pretension. Windy City Heat can only be compared to itself, as all else falters in its shadow.Perry is NOT GAY!"
1,No Good!,"Contacts don't stay connected. If it moves at all ( which, is the point of a Car Charger) it shorts out."
1,"Great Camera, Awful battery life!","I read alot of reviews before purchasing this camera and I was amazed at all of the features that this camera has. However, I quickly found that all of these features where useless because after taking only 1 picture using the LCD the battery indicator would flash and the camera would turn off. I thought I must have a faulty camera and upon calling HP technical support they told me that I should be able to take around 6 pictures using the LCD. I was disapointed to hear that 6 pictures would be the maximum pictures I could take when my friend was taking over 80 pictures with his Fuji on christmas day. I have a great camera with lots of features that is always being recharged."
3,Too Heavy,"I bought these for light use as a match to the Cuisipro measuring spoons (which are perfect). The cups, however are too heavy for the little hanging ring they come with. I keep them on a hook near my range and the little ring separates occasionally when I brush against it and the cups crash to the floor. No damage to the cups of course, but irritating none the less."
3,Sturdy But Uncomfortable,These are very strudy and heavy measuring cups. The oval shape is nice but not as necessary as it is for measuring spoons. The handle edges are a bit sharp and due to the heavy weight they dig into your flesh making them uncomfortable to use.
4,Exciting and funny!,"It's very unusual to find BDSM stories that can be at the same time exciting and amusing... Temporary Slave is the first story I read that fulfilled both qualities. Reese Gabriel writes with a special emotional intensity, Marshall and Meridian are an amazing couple, he is the perfect alpha male that I would love to meet, dominating, charismatic, careful, kind and she is incredibly imaginative, funny, sensual, strong and vulnerable. The BDSM is well-delineated in a soft way the heats your feelings without scaring you, the plot is simple, I would have prefer more depth but I loved this book!"
5,Make Room For Daddy Season 6,"Excellent, great show beautifully restored to DVD format, highly recomend for anyone who enjoys 1950's comedy show."
3,But Why Did Sherry go?,"Great work bringing this season to DVD, but this is the season that poses a question I have been wondering ever since I was a kid watching this series. Why was Sherry Jackson removed from the series, later to be replaced by a lookalike actor (Penney Parker)?????She appears in three episodes then is just ""gone"", in the 1959-60 she returns as having come back from college and having graduated (what a short course!!)I read somewhere at one time that Jackson who had played his daughter since the series began, had become intimidated by Thomas as she matured and grew into a young woman and asked to leave. Does anyone know the real story? Would love to hear."
5,Make room for this one,I'm really glad to see that they're releasing another season of Danny Thomas. I've watched the 5th season over and over. Great humor and all around enjoyable entertainment. Looking forward to it.
2,A bit thin,"The color of the mat was irrelevent to me. I did notice there were a variety of colors, but the sender makes the choice. I was looking for something to make the floor a bit softer while exercising to overcome an injury. This mat is extremely thin, not good for my injury. However, it was not a total loss, my grandaughter has taken great pleasure in using it as a playmat."
2,YOU NEED MORE THAN 8 but good choices,I Look for books all the time on this topic to see if there any new moves I can pick up to help shape and tone the stomach area which is a problem for most of us. I think if you are just starting out this book will help you understand the positions you need to get into but it's going to take alot more than 8 minutes to get results and I have been training for years.
1,Waste of money,Bought this book and his other waste of money book (3-Day Diet). Much better books on diet and eating right on Amazon then this trash. Don't waste your money.
3,Too repetitive,"The thing I liked best about ""8 Minutes in the Morning"" was the variety of exercises. ...Flat Belly is much to repetitive for me to consistently follow the plan. I'm mixing the exercises in with ""8 Minutes..."" --I might not get results as quickly, but I also won't be so bored I quit."
2,sgold dissappointedwith first week none results,"bought the 8 Minutes in the Morning for Extra easy Weight Losss book and followed it religiously from exercises to Meal preparations. Really enjoyed the meals, and the easy exercises, but have had no results, whatsoever. Besides that I do Pelates twice a week at a gym, and I was sure that with this little boost, surely I would loose weight. I'm dissappointed, but will continue on to week two, perhaps then I will see a difference, hopefully."
3,8 minutes in the morning for a flat belly,It's a great buy! Easy to follow. I'm looking forward to using it for my weight loss plan.
5,Another turn of the screw!,"This book certainly is for everyone! It's a brilliant combination of ghostly mystery and paean to the power of art. When I finished it, I didn't know whether to re-read it or start looking for John Singer Sargent prints.In a scant 176 pages Rees has created pictures and voices as indelible as Sargent's paintings. Rather that the stereotyped, cardboard characters of too many mysteries (and young adult books), Rees' characters stand out and remain long after the book is fnished. Each of the Boit girls is a jewel; even the sinister doll Popau is as sharply etched as a Goya drawing. What a wonderful introduction to a too-often-ignored artist."
5,Monster is the best!,These cables are great! They are built of very strong materials this making them very hard to break! The quality of the sound from these cables are very clear and crisp! Monster is the best!
3,recipe box,"this item is a 3x5 box inside and the description doesn't let you know that, but the item is very cute."
3,"OK, I guess","I heard the Rhapsody Pathetique on the radio, and was intriqued. Never having heard of Nanes before, I decided to sample his work. The works definitely set a mood; they are not very complex and tend to be a little boring. Other 20th century composers have more to offer."
1,At least the composition titles are apt,"Let's see, perhaps the composer was on to something with the names he chose for these works: Pathetic Rhapsody (you can say that again!) ... Gross Concerto (spot on!) ...But just as they say about adult films ... the best thing about these pieces is their titles. The rest is just trash."
1,inferior composer,"A cardinal rule of music composition is: don't try to hold the audience's attention with a slow piece for longer than 5 minutes unless your name is Samuel Barber. Since Nanes wanders aimlessly for 20 minutes, he is certainly in violation of this rule. The c minor chords sound very somber at first, but they soon lose their novelty.Sorry, I can't tell you about the other two compositions, because they lost my attention, too."
3,WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE,"I love web belts for casual wear, and for their ease of adjustment.This bely is available in a great variety of colors, with several buckles from which to choose.Unfortunately, the webbing is a bit too thin for the ""teeth"" that hold the buckle in place, so the buckle often falls off when taking the belt off (such as at airport security).Luckily, it stays together well when it is being worn.This would be a great item with a bit heavier webbing."
2,Disappointing,"I normally buy the double-sided tarp from Home Depot and was looking to buy from a non-box store and save a little money. Unfortunately, this tarp falls short. It is definitely thinner than the HD tarp. I haven't had a chance to really test the durability of this tarp, but I'm guessing I'll only get one year out of it [I get two years with the HD tarp.]It also bothers me that they claim this is a 5.5oz/yard material. Maybe that means something other than what it seems to say, but I weighed it and it comes out well short - including the packaging and reinforcing, etc.All-in-all I think it is a much better tarp than you get buying the cheap blue tarps, but not as good as a $29 heavy duty tarp bought elsewhere. The extra $5 for a second year of use would be well worth it."
1,waste of money,"I have had this tarp for four months May - Aug it looked great and heavy duty but its now falling apart,I would not purchase one again, it will not hold up to the elements for more than a few months."
5,Keeps the snow and water off of my patio furniture,"I bought this tarp to keep my hardwood outdoor furniture free of snow and ice this winter. So far, it is working well. I don't see any leaks and the material seems quite durable. I hope to use this again next winter. I am using Bungee Ball Cords to keep it in place (it comes with grommets to run the cords through). Heavy winds have not blown this tarp off, but I was careful in securing the slack."
1,Quickly deteriorates in the sun,"In less than 3 months of covering my Jeep the silver coating flaked off, leaving a huge mess, and it started tearing apart. Previous silver tarps I've used have lasted 1-2 years, this does not stand up to UV exposure."
5,excellent quaily,"this is a thick and sturdy tarp. eylets are strong and have no complaints. We used this tarp on a 4 day 32 mile trek. rapped all our gear each day and used it as a shelter at night. held up great. Others in our party had tarps that split, eyelets broke, ect. We had Zero issues. Really loved the thickness. Great Tarp. PJ"
2,Defective,I opened up the package and one of the rings fell out. After looking at the tarp I found that one of the rings was ripped off. Poor quality control.I now wish I had opened the package sooner so that I could have gotten a replacement for it. My own fault obviously (Lesson learned).I do not think I would buy another one from this maker.I took a spare rope and ran it through all the remaining rings and am using it to cover my log rack. Now I just need to find a higher quality one to replace what this one was to be used for.
4,Great for Burning Man,"I brought this tarp to burning man 2010 and made a shade structure out of it. Basically I tied one end to my ford explorer rack and propped the other side up with aluminum poles held down to the ground with ropes and stakes. The wind was not bad at all this year on the playa, however, out of the few storms that did occur, the tarp held up great.The reinforced corners are very strong. The metal grommets did end up bending and nearly ripping out of the tarp due to lots of wind force focused on those points. You need to make sure to really use the corners for most of the pressure when tying this tarp down otherwise the other grommits not on the corners will rip out of the tarp. I almost lost a couple grommits, but the rope reinforced edge of the tarp made sure they didn't rip the tarp completely. My tarp did rip a bit on the inside, not on the edge.I would recommend this tarp, it's fairly strong and well priced."
3,"Heavy duty, but had a problem","This tarp is heavy duty and is cut to the right size, but 2 of the grommets were too close to the edge and not usable. They both fell out in my hand when I pulled on them. Poor workmanship. Maybe I just got a bad one. No inspection?"
4,tarp,"Purchased this to use as a groundcloth for a new tent. It is larger and thicker than the tarps I find at the local hardware stores, so I'm pleased. One corner grommet was loose, but I don't use them, so no loss for me."
3,"Fair Information, poorly editied, expensive","Plenty of good points regarding Project Management, PM theory, PM structure, and team building. However, the book has a very large number of obvious editorial errors. There are a lot of spelling errors and typos and a few factual errors. For a book that costs as much as this does, it was really sloppily edited. Which is extra annoying because each chapter is essentially an article from an expert on the topic of that chapter (Cleland did not write the whole book so the voice of the book changes with each chapter.), so I would have thought at least they could have independently edited each chapter if Cleland didn't want to edit the whole book once it was complete.Back to subject matter. A lot of this book refers directly to the PMI PMBOK, which essentially has the same information at a much lower cost."
3,Its really small,"This is a great product, and it does exactly what is says its supposed to do... BUT its extremely small. I Thought it was going to be a bit bigger but its really small. So its kind of a pain to use. And only works for really small seeds (like strawberry, blueberry or something like that) Bigger seeds like lemon, or artichoke are just too big for this."
5,Very good.,"I tried the $1.00 store version of a splatter guard before I broke down and invested in this model. Unlike the cheapo version, this does not burn around the edges or discolor and the handle is very stable - plus, there is no plastic that can get hot and melt.....lol.....The ""legs"" are great, just like other reviewers have mentioned.I'm glad I read the reviews and went ahead with the small investment. This will last for ages and cleans up great.Highly recommend."
3,Could be Heavier,"This is a convenient splatter guard, and the mesh is tight enough to prevent most splattering. However, the guard is extremely light weight. I wish it was heavier and therefore sat a bit more snugly on my pans."
4,Nice and not flimsy,"I bought this because at 13"" round it is large enough to cover my largest saute pan. It definitely has kept me from having to clean the entire stovetop after meal preparation and seems sturdy enough to last. Washed nicely without the rust I've encountered on cheaper screens."
4,I would recommend,This cd set makes you think and make connections to the old baggage so many of us carry around. It's a great step to moving forward and letting go. My only disappointment was that they didn't explore more tools to moving forward.
5,Mercer's storytelling genius,"Yes, the voice has faded from its recorded strongest point (50s recordings--oh had someone recorded her in the 30s.) But a pretty voice was never Mercer's point. She is one of the great storytellers of cabaret singing and her dramatic phrasing--poignant here, dramatic there, from wry to wonder--is as powerful as ever and perhaps more so with the wisdom of her 76 years. My Aunt saw Mercer in New York during this period and was so moved that she ordered a phone to share a bit of the concert with my midwest bound mother. Mercer, as a song saver and storyteller is peerless. Now let's get The Art of Mabel Mercer re-issued as soon as possible."
2,A little disappointing,"If you've got to know the wonderful Mabel Mercer from the Cole Porter CD also stocked by Amazon and you grab this one as the only other CD of hers currently available you may be a little disappointed. One of the customer reviewers of the Cole Parter said that she was past her best on that disc, mostly recorded when she was in her early to middle 50s. I just wish I could hear her earlier work as I think the Cole Porter is quite wonderful. But Echoes of my Life was made when Ms Mercer was 76 - incredibly enough. It's hardly fair to say that she's past her prime perhaps - it's a miracle that she was working at all - but it's undoubtedly true. There are occasional flashes of her genius, but they are sadly isolated. It is curious, to put it mildly, that albums like this are being issued when none of her earlier work (which I understand was copiously recorded) is available."
3,"For a different angle on Hitler, this book is a ""must"" read.","I never thought I would come across a Hitler book written from a perspective different from all other biographical analysis out there. For example, this book does not begin with the premise that Hitler was born evil and was so his entire life. Instead, it recounts the somewhat poignant experience of knowing Hitler as a teenager who had dreams and passion (as many young people do), yet was one that had unresolved issues to contend with... The reader may even conclude that evil people aren't always born that way, but become so because of life's experiences. The best part about the book is that it's also an intimate, bittersweet account of Central European lifestyles that have vanished. The author's detailed, articulate writing style makes it hard to put this book down."
3,interesting,"This book is interesting as a general look into the mind of Hitler as a young man. It is not a source of detail. It gives a bit about Hitler's early anti-Semitism, but as virtually all books which address anti-Semitism are utter nonsense, this is not much better- here just the impression of one young man's feelings by another, more honest than usual, but hardly a real exploration of Hitler's mind in this area.Hitler as moralist, young, unformed--that is what we see."
1,"Adolf 'n August, Sittin' In a Tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G",Fascinating account of the torrid gay romance between Adolf Hitler and August Kubizek. Includes many heretofore unseen photographs of the future leader of the master race stooping to conquer and to be conquered. Also includes an account of the Jewish boy who broke Adolf's heart by rejecting his unwanted advances.
4,Top notch Carolina blues with a boogie beat,"Skeeter Brandon's voice brings to mind a mellow Clarence Carter paired with a strong shot of boogie blues that makes you want to dance. Backed by the tight and strong Hwy 61 band, the music drives and pushes. But Skeeter's voice keeps it soulful at the same time. The lyrics are clever and you will laugh out loud at times. I was impressed by the the production. This is a band that has spent a lot of time in clubs perfecting their craft. They are the real thing. No ""blues lite"" here. If you like soulful Carolina blues with a boogie beat, this is your CD."
5,Othello's Children,"This book is a must-read! The research is superb, insightful, and elegantly infused into the social commentary of the text. Pimienta-Bey has undoubtedly risen to the top of scholars addressing the history of the Moors and their worldwide influence on civilization. As engaging as it is informative, I find this book to be a necessary addition to anyone's library!"
3,Well Made Product,"This is a quality product. However you should be aware that the spoons are very heavy for their size [they weigh a quarter of a pound]. Also, because of their design, when you set them down they roll over on their side. For these reasons I almost returned them."
5,"Solid, high quality, ergonomic","These measuring spoons feel solid, high quality, and ergonomic in your hand. They have a nice weight to them. The oblong shape is useful for getting baking powder or soda out of the package."
5,Just what we needed,"I was looking for a measuring spoon set that was fairly inexpensive, yet good quality, and I didn't want any numbers printed on - they had to be imprinted into the metal, so as to never rub off. These do the job, and I won't have to worry about the numbers rubbing off after repeated use and washings."
2,"Sturdy, poor craftsmanship","These are definitely a sturdy set of measuring spoons, but several of them have sharper edge. Definitely could have been better."
5,Seem expensive?,"I got tired of buying measuring spoons. Plastic ones discolor and the sizing usually rubs off. Lot of metal spoon sets lack the 1/8"" size. The oval shape of these are also nice for fitting into spice jars. Seem expensive? Not in the long run. I don't believe I will ever have to buy more.ll/2/12MINE ARE NOT RED, BUT WHEN I PURCHASED MY SET, THE AMAZON PICTURE WAS OF THE STAINLESS STEEL (SILVERTONE) ONES.I placed my review before the picture changed."
5,Great spoons,Nice quality spoons. They sit well on the kitchen counter to balance. Good quality for the stainless too. I threw all my old ones away as they do not match up to this set.
5,Awesome.,"Much better than my previous (plastic) sets. The oval shape is really useful for dipping into jars, and find the measurements more accurate than other sets. Very happy with purchase, and would buy other items from company to try."
1,The size is not accurate,"The size is not accurate, which is not acceptable for measuring spoons. Returned them, wish they would have been the correct measurements because they were nice looking."
2,Poor quality/quality control.,"Functionally, the unit works fine. But on installation, one of the holes in the plastic base plate had to be reamed out to size so that the tiny screw holding the face plate could be screwed in, making the installation unnecessarily tedious. In addition, the metal nut securing the timer face plate threads onto a plastic bush. You cannot thread it on with your fingers because of the recessing. But even with very little torque using a pair of pliers, the metal nut stripped the plastic threads at very low pressure. Why use a cheap plastic bushing instead of a metal one? (obviously, to save costs). My first reaction was ""More cheap Chinese imports"", but in fact it proudly proclaims ""Made in USA""!"
5,The Perfect Ship still missing ONE Mast!,"The only way to improve upon this volume would be to include ""Helen in Egypt"" in the next edition. Then it would be truly complete, and truly perfect, fit to sail unto the unfix-ed Stars!"
1,This program is horrible!,"I purchased this program about 2 months ago. We installed it on our system and started using it. Not the most user friendly program but after a few weeks we started to figure things out for our business. Then our computer crashed and after backing everything up repeatedly.... it was all gone. Then it wouldn't let me reinstall the program because serial number had already been installed. I called the help desk and they wouldn't help me because it was a week past free help expiration 30 day date. After another week we were able to reinstall the program but I had to start from scratch -- lost all the data... but now the program won't ""restart"" the way it did when it began. It won't even let me choose the ""type"" of company we own so that it will pregenerate the deductions we need to use... like: gas. What a complete waste of $150 and now we have to go buy another program.... I don't know what I hate more the program or the lack of customer support. Save your money!"
2,"Slow and ""Clunky""","I'm not an accountant, but I am a businessman. I have used One Write Plus for 13 years. Since OWP is no longer on the market, and the fact that I'm switching accountants, I bought the Peachtree Pro 2008. I'm not at all impressed. On the click of my mouse my OWP was up, running and ready to use in 3 seconds. It takes Peachtree 10 seconds or more to load. I'm using a new Dell with a 2 duo core 2.4 GgHZ intel processor and 2 Gg of RAM, so it's not my computer. Also the tax updates are extremely expensive ($249 a year) What's up with that when you can change them yourself for free? Before buying this mess, check with your accountant for other software, there's got to be something better than this out there."
4,There are glitches in all software,It should be obvious that most all software programs have glitches. The complaints about Peachtree are similar to Quickbooks reviews. Buy the software and test it on your system. If it doesn't work then get new software or hardware. But as far as a WORKING Peachtree setup versus a WORKING Quickbooks setup...I'll take Peachtree. Why? Compare Peachtree's general ledger to Quickbooks general ledger report. Peachtree wins.
1,Defective on Arrival,"I was influenced by the promise of good coffee, but I never had the opportunity because the filter door latch mechanism was defective on arrival. For the price, I would have expected better quality control and simpler operation. Also, from the picture you cannot tell that the filter door opens to the wall behind the Capresso, meaning that you have to reach around the side of the door to load the filter. A coffee maker should be simply designed and easy to operate, and in my view the Capresso has too many moving parts to ensure reliable operation over the years."
4,"Expensive, but great features and good coffee","I bought this coffee maker for my husband after being unable to find the KitchenTools model he was interested in. We have been quite satisfied with it. Have not experienced any of the problems the other reviewers have mentioned. The caraffe will not store in the unit with the lid completely closed, but if you open it a half-turn it stores just fine, and if you leave it in the unit until you make coffee, you wouldn't want to have stored it closed, anyway! The removeable water tank is quite handy, although the filter gets in the way and we removed it because we have filtered water from the tap. Every time he uses it, my husband tells me how happy he is with it."
4,I love this hot coffee!,"I wish I could spend a couple thousand dollars on a coffee pot that acts like a Star Trek replicator. But since my budget is stuck in reality... For the price, this is the best coffee pot around. The heat of the water makes a big difference in the quality of brewed coffee. This pot makes much hotter coffee than standard models, even from very good companies, that go for around $60 or more. You do have to make at least 6 ""cups"" for the coffee to get really hot. But if you follow that guideline, this pot is awesome!"
2,Cheap plastic parts,"I had the same problems that some of the other reviewers had, cheap plastic parts that broke and render the coffe maker unuseable, and that darn drippy carafe that made us have to locate a towel close by to constantly wipe up afterwards. Good coffee, but so cheaply made that it only lasted a few months."
2,Not a Good Value,"OK, so I'm a piker but this is the most I've ever paid for a coffee maker. It is no better than my previous $69 Krups. and it makes only 8 cups. This was my first purchase of a thermal coffeemaker and I guess I expected miracles but the carafe doesn't keep the coffee any warmer than my previous 15 year old carafe. The main problem is trying to get the carafe lid on; it takes at least 2-3 tries which is not the most pleasent thing to deal with in the morning.I should have tried Consumer Report's best buy for a thermal coffeemaker--the $49 Mr. coffee and let Capresso perfect their product before buying one!"
4,Great features except one!,"Our household appreciates a good cup of coffee and the Capresso certainly delivers it. The features we were looking for included a removeable water reservoir, the capablity of being programmed and a thermal carafe instead of a warming plate. The only draw back is that it only has an eight cup capacity! On the rare occasion that coffee is left in the carafe, the temperature the carafe maintains is really good. We have had coffee over 4 hours later that was still piping hot and very flavorful.The charcoal filter may be an added benefit for some, however it is redundant for us because we have an inline water filtration system."
1,Broken in 3 Months,"For many years I used a Capresso thermal coffeemaker with great results, until the heating element gave out. Three months ago I purchased the Capresso Elegance. It doesn't heat the water beyond tepid, and today a plastic part broke off the bottom of the filter basket. The coffeemaker is now inoperable, unless you insert something like a knife to line up the basket with the drip mechanism, and then carefully withdraw the knife and try to close the basket door. I'll be contacting Capresso to discover whether they might be able to forward a new basket to me, but this Capresso product no longer rates high on my list!"
2,"Nice Idea, Cheaply Made","I purchased the coffee maker because I hate the taste of coffee after it has been on the burner for too long. I am very disappointed that after one week, the internal plastic component that allows you to take the pot out while brewing, broke off. Not too long after that, the carafe leaked."
3,Increasing disappointment,"After three years of daily use, averaging one 8-cup operation per day, the 437.01 now requires three to four restarts in order to completely drain the reservoir. Scrupulous cleaning no longer improves the situation, so do we do without while awaiting repair/replacement or bite the bullet and buy something new?We really like the coffee, enjoy the carafe feature, and have found that the easily broken temporary shut off is readily replaced. What is a suitable replacement?"
1,Awful customer service/terrible product,"I would not buy a Capresso product again because of their TERRIBLE customer service. My coffee maker failed to make hot coffee, and the company wouldn't do anything other than blame me---user error!! Fortuantely, the seller (Plum's Cooking) was fabulous and agreed to take the coffee maker back and refund my money. I would shop with Plum's again, but not for a Capresso product. Be warned!!"
5,Don't know much about art but I know what I like.,"Some time ago I decided to change to playing 1. e4,e5 2. Nf3,Nc6 with black - mainly to get into the two knights that I'd been fascinated by. Seeing this book appearing was too good to be true. I bought it instantly and started reading it thinking he couldn't really cover everything. In truth he doesn't. He doesn't cover the Ruy. But after going through this book, you should be prepared for everything else white throws at you. He covers a lot of lines very lightly, but sufficiently that you can sit down in front of the board and play them with confidence. On some lines you may want additional stuff - e.g. KG and scotch, but he is all around the white repertoire. Bottom line: The best opening book I have read. If you want to play 2.Nc6, you want this book on the shelf."
4,Something that every practitioner should read,"This is a tome that should be in every Family Physician's library. It is very current and shows in great detail where American medicine has and is failing to care for the patients most in need. There are world-wide comparisons and also intelligent remedies offered that are founded on experience, the only way to analyze and understand the real problems. There are a plethora of footnotes with credit given to thousands of medical authors and this only widens and increases my respect for this author. Change is inevitable and here is a solution."
4,satisfied customer,"The velvet and satin lined cape is really very nice. All pieces I thought were well made. To me worth $31.26. Would cost much more in time and effort to make something!My 7yr old LOVES it even though I bought a Large which he is swimming in. Oh, and it washed very well in cold and delicate cycle. NOTE: the material does contain fire retardant."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I cannot attest to the quality of this product because I never received it. I did order it and ordered it 2 day shipping 10 days in advance for my sons birthday. Today, Friday, I received an email stating it was out of stock, his birthday party is tomorrow.As the title reads....Poor Customer Service"
1,Ideology over substance,"If you want the tired Republican party line on the so-called ""left liberal conspiracy"" read this book. To the author of this book, I say ""go get a mirror and take a good hard look at yourself."" The Republican Right is draining this country dry in the name of ""Freedom,"" benefiting only the very rich. They have co-opted the media into pursuing this agenda through FCC deregulation and pedaling access in exchange for compliance. Read this and laugh if you don't start seething or crying first."
1,The Left is the Right's ATM machine,"Just saw this fellow on Fox, which, as a leftist, I watch much the way Kremlinologists used to watch Pravda--to see what the enemy is thinking.I rate this basically as one of a series of bash the left books. You're a rightwinger and need money? Write one of these screeds to join the ranks of Savage, Hannity, Coulter. Where will it end? This genre represents an ATM from which you can make a withdrawal without depositing anything in the way of ideas.Most of the hatred I see is from the people who write and read these books.(If only the left were as powerful as these people would want us to believe. Last time I checked the three branches of the government are controlled by Republicans. Dare I say we get the government we deserve? Heaven help us.)"
1,Elitist propaganda at it's very best,"It's amazing how a conservative who disagrees with liberal views can go on about what is wrong with those liberal views in an effort to support only HIS views. Daniel Flynn makes a strong case for loving our country but he segregates people into such black-and-white categories that skinheads and jews end up looking friendly. Americans are a diverse group of people and you don't learn to ""LOVE"" anything by division. It's through common ground that we focus on what it great about this country. This is the same humorless rhetoric we've heard since cavemen scratched their balls. Daniel Flynn's explanation: They do it because they can and people who don't, well they must not have balls to scratch. Daniel Flynn should only be ashamed that a publishing house gave him a contract. He is a meathead and a bore. No wonder he heads the Accuracy in Academia Council. His story is the only story. And the ""right"" one at that. Snore....."
1,How about Why Conservatives Hate America,"The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it."
5,Met Mr. Flynn last night,I have not read the book but I attended a lecture at Louisiana State University on 10/14/03 and Mr. Flynn discussed the book at length. If the book is anything like the lecture it is a must read. Mr. Flynn discussed the overwhelming liberal bias that exists on college campuses today the effect it is having on students.
1,Kook writes book and ignores history.,"In this book, the author purports to explain why the Left (symbolized by Red on the cover - very subtle -N0?) hates American but confuses criticism with hatred.He gives us a lot of anecdotal evidence but does not gives us any relative facts or statistics to back up his claims.He also ignores history, There is no narrative about how America stole much of the land and brutalized the people who lived here before the Europeans came.He ignores America's history of slavery.He ignores Manifest Destiny.In all, the author is just plain ignorant and wants to spread his hate and xenophobia beyond his own error filled mind."
3,zippered flap caps,Great idea but the one-size-fits-all claim is not true; it's too large for me. It's fits my husband fine though.
5,The Only Guide You'll Ever Need,"As a Disney World planner extraordinaire I was certain that this book wouldn't offer any new insights for me before our trip in Dec 2003. I was mistaken. It was the perfect tool for planning, organizing, and documenting our journey. It was so useful that I ordered the 2004 edition for our trip in Jan 2004. The new maps, stickers, PassPockets, and sheer volume of information makes it the only guide for the World we will ever need. There are pages for detailed planning as well as specific reviews of restaurants, parks, and rides that made our itinerary planning much easier. They are on top of changes with updates from their website and provide detailed information that will prove invaluable in planning the ultimate Walt Disney World vacation. Even for a ""veteran"" of 6 vacations, this is the ultimate Walt Disney World guidebook."
5,Great Book for Physics Enthusiasts!,"I bought this book after reading the previous reviews, and it was exactly the book I had imagined. The more you read, the more you want to know about the world and how things work in our world. Physics is amazingly applied throughout our lives knowingly and unknowingly. The curiosities just keep going. After finishing it, you can correct your friends on misconcepted ideas or explain to them the theories behind an event.This paperback has 397 questions/puzzles, each with an answer in the back. Questions range from simple ones like what is the difference between gas and vapor, to more complex ones like the architecture of a rollercoaster. Although someone earlier had recommended this book for children, I would say that most of the braintwisters require some fundamental understanding of physics that a highschool student would have an easier time with. But again it is certainly a great choice and a must-have if you are one of those physics maniacs like me."
3,"Good material, not formatted well for Kindle.","Although the material in the book is good, it is very difficult to read on the Kindle. The questions and answers are in different sections of the book, and there are no links between them. It would be much better if each question had a link to its answer.The best I've been able to do is keep a bookmark at the current question and answer I'm reading and go back and forth, but it's painful."
4,finally,Finally got the product after a couple of weeks of mix ups. it's what i wanted for a gift for a friend. it was in good shape for not being new. the seller was prompt in working with me in fixing the mix up.
5,Eat it up!,This is one of the best cookbooks I have seen in years. The recipes are easy and delicious. Most of them are quick to prepare and use ingredients that I already have in my house. I love the nutritional information and menu ideas. There is something for everyone!
3,I used to use this,"This product is deep purple. If you're using it for gray hair, you either have to dilute it or alternate it with another shampoo, or you'll end up with the lavender hair look so common in older ladies of yesteryear. (On the other hand, this may be your goal: there was an article in the New York Times about girls in their 20's putting gray and lavender streaks in their hair as a trend (Spring, 2010). If it's your goal to tone the yellow out of gray or bleached hair, I would suggest a shampoo with BLUE tone."
3,"Attractive, but not that functional","They are large, but too thin to stand up on their sides when playing dominoes. Also, since they are made out of wood with wood grain, they are pretty, but because of knot holes and grain designs, you can memorize which domino some are while facing down on the table."
4,Get into the head of Mary Ellen Mark,"This book uses a Q&A format in an interview with Mary Ellen Mark and the Smithsonian asks all the right questions. They start out with how she got started, what it takes to put a photo essay together, if she uses assistants and if art directors have a say over what she does.My only complaint about this is how short it is. But in these 62 pages the first half gives you what it takes to start in making great pictures and the second half shows you some of Mark's awesome work.As a student of photojournalism looking to do similar work, this is a valuable resource."
2,tarded camera work,"Getting tired of tarded camera work, someone start a school for these people? make them all sit and watch Roger Waters In the Flesh, and Led Zep DVD set of 2003. pure and simple. stop blowing it!!!!!a let down because of the audio mix. Very violin heavy. You can barely hear the guitar on most songs even during the solos (with the exception of The Bash). I found this to be the same with the other Dregs DVD. This DVD is definitely the Alan Sloan show. It is almost comical how many times you see Steve's back in order to get a shot at Sloan playing. Even during the bass solo they cut to Sloan clapping his hands. TARDED!"
4,Very nice!,"It's sooo great to have a live old Dregs DVD! Based upon that I would buy it again. The sound quality is very good, the video is very good. but.... once again Steve is not the focus of the performance visually or in the audio mix. Yes , you guessed it, the violinist is the focal point. He's great, but if you are looking to see steve completely wailing, you aren't going to get it. Most of the show has him at an angle, not many front on guitar shots, but it's still quite good for most of his solos.Buy it, The band is tight and hot!"
4,"Different product, but works great.","The cable I received was not the clear silver one pictured, which I was a little confused about. However, the black cable I received does the job, so it doesn't really matter. Would give 5 stars for the cable I got in the mail, but I'm giving 4 stars because it's not technically the one I ordered."
1,Not accrate,This does not follow the Holy Bible. Stuff in here that is just plain inaccurate. Save your $

5,A Must-Have Book for improving health and immunity,"For anyone who has health issues or has loved ones with health issues, this book is a must-have. Organic Germanium is the one supplement that my family members with cancer take and this book explains why and how it works in somewhat layman terms. I have bought many copies to send out to friends who have been diagnosed with cancer or who just want to learn more about what dis-ease in the body can do to our health and how organic germanium may help mitigate the effects of the dis-ease."
5,Smart Score,"Smart Score incorperates MIDI and ENF to make a dynamic program. A great program for composers of all ages, It's features allow for advanced notationand MIDI recording. It also accepts MIDI input. It gives music a professional look and can save hours of hand-drawing."
1,Cheap and derivative,"This recording has absolutely nothing to recommend it. The style is derivative of so many other compositions. And it's not even ""authentic"" to this composer, who has written in pretty much every classical music style that's ever come down the pike.Do I detect a musical charlatan?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Elves, politics, intrigue and tarts, in the time of the Restoration. With the odd execution and more than a few battles.A Duke is coming back to England. No-one knows that he is half-elf,as this would be his downfall. Here, King Arthur is a very bad man, andhe wants to return him as his all powerful mystical overlord."
1,Game not compatible,The game did not work on my computer. It is too old for my machine. I was very unhappy that you would sell a game that isn't compatible with newer models.
5,Fun,"I loved the game but it broke years ago. I was thrilled I found it at Amazon. The price was OK, the shipping time was good, the game was not in its original case but arrived in good shape. It works and I love it."
2,Forget the cleaning stand,"The shaver is excellent and generally better than the Braun although it seems to accumulate water if you use it wet. However, the cleaning stand died quickly and won't clean anymore. It was erratic from the start.I rate the shaver a 4 and the and the stand a big 0 for myoverall of 2"
2,"Good shaver, but broken after 13 months","The shaver works pretty well for me and I have thick facial hair. I get a close shave every time for the first few months, however, I do notice after about 6 months of use the shave isn't quite as close anymore. Probably due to the foils being worn. The manufacturer suggests replacing the outer foil after 1 year and and the inner after 2 years. I would give a higher rating if it didn't break on me after exactly 13 months of use. The warranty period is 1 year! I would expect a $130 (price I paid on Jan 15, 2006 at Amazon) shaver to last longer than 13 months. I will try to see if Panasonic will still honor the warranty considering it is just 1 month over the warranty period."
2,Neat shaver but it didn't work on me.,"I have never had an electric shaver always a razor. I envied the quick easy electric shave but never had any luck in the past. Then I read all these ""Best thing since sliced bread"" reviews on this particular shaver and was persuaded to buy thanx to Amazon's good return policy I didn't have to worry about being saddled with a $100 shaver I didn't like.It worked good enough on my face. If it could have worked that well on my neck I probably would have kept it. It couldn't shave my neck at all. Wet or dry I was stuck shaving for longer than I would have with a razor to try to get it all and it never got it all. Cool package and all the cleaning and charging stuff worked great it just wouldn't shave my neck."
5,"Great razor, make sure you don't clean it yourself!","Obviously, you can always clean it yourself, but throwing down the extra $15 every three months is well worth it. I thought I'd try to rinse it off each time on my own and use the brush which came with the razor. I did that for about three months. It never got totally clean. I figured that to be normal whether I cleaned it or I used the cleaning system. I thought I'd give the cleaning system another try and it cleaned the razor like new!All this to say, make sure you use the cartridge system it tells you to!Also, the whole issue some users have with sensitive skin is mentioned in the user's guide. If you're transitioning from disposable blades, expect some irritation. However, it does leave after several uses.Excellent product overall."
1,Great product when it works,"I bought this product looking for an alternative to a regular razor. It's now a year later and guess what, i'am using a regular razor. The panasonic worked great, but it had one major flaw it died after around 6 months of use. I expected more from this product considering the price, but it's just an overpriced piece of junk. If you want an elertric razor look at the other brands, but never pay more then $100 for one."
4,Very Close Shave,"Closest shave I've received from an electric. It takes a little longer to shave with this model, but far more effective than Braun or Norelco."
2,Shaver,I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he didnt like it. I bought it partically for the trimmer and the fact its one of the most recommended shaver. The shaver works well enough but the trimmer pretty much burnt and melted his beard. Which stunk up the house. We ended up returning it. Not worth it in my opinion for the price you pay for it.
4,"Nice shaver, but I wouldn't lose my mind over it.","I had been using an old Norelco triple-header for years and decided to try a new one that would shave closer.It does shave closer than my old one, but not in one stroke like some users have said. I would hope it's closer since my old one had been used for years and should have been duller.It feels good in my hand...not too big or small.The noise is no different than my old shaver, just the usual buzzing. No problem.The cleaning system is pretty slick. After I shave I plug it in when I go to work and when I get home it looks great. I take off the head to see how clean and I was happy to see there didn't appear to be any stray whiskers in there.I've only had it a few weeks, but at least in the short run it is performing nicely."
3,Only good for dry shaving,"This shaver's dry shaving is good. But its wet shaving is very problematic. Though the manufacturer claims it's wet/dry, the blade and screen is not well designed for wet work. When using foam in shaving, the skin becomes more sensative and tender, which requires the blade to be sharp as a real razor. Panasonic certainly cannot meet this. Though they claim the inner blade is the sharpest 30 degree blade up to date, the more useful two outer blades are still 90 degree. The holes on the screen are also too big for wet shaving, though they are OK for dry work. Because of these design flaws, after applying foam in a wet shaving, more sensitive skin goes into the holes and is scanned by blunt blades. The result is terrible-- the shaver peeled off a very thin layer from my side cheek skin and caused a large area of irritation. Now, my cheeks are full of scars.This Panasonic one is not ready to be a good wet shaving product."
2,Another One Gets Returned,"I've had this razor for about three weeks, and I'm now sending it back. I've seen no improvement in those three weeks, and even though you're supposed to use it for a month to see results, Amazon's return policy leaves me no choice but to guess that another week won't help that much.I have a very course beard, and at first this razor did a great job on my cheeks, it barely touches my chin, and does virtually nothing on my neck except cut me. With my Mach 3, I soak my beard in hot water for at least five minutes before shaving, and I did no different with this Panasonic. I'm not interested in shaving with this razor then going back over my whole face with an expensive Mach 3.Take this with a grain of salt if your beard isn't this thick (I have a permanent five o'clock shadow like Homer Simpson unfortunately), but keep my experience in mind if you do."
2,Not as good as advertised,This shaver looked like a good one but it does not shave close enough.Every time I shave I have to shave with the trimmer to get a closer shave because the shaver does not shave longer hair.I was very disappointed with this product and I am in search of a better replacement.
4,Genuinely better than others,"I have shaved with electrics all my life, had a few norelcos and never noticed a big difference between them.This is the first shaver I have had that genuinely shaves better - it is substantially smoother when I shave and a day later I am just beginning to get shadowy.There are a few catches-shaving well with this shaver takes longer, in my experience, than with other electrics, especially if you go wet.it can nick your skin a little and draw a drop of blood once in a while, not too painful but not what I expected.loud - noisyI think the cleaning base is mostly a gimmick - cleans fine in the shower or sink with soap.In summary, it is the ""power tool"" of shaving - a stronger, better shave with more noise, an occasional nick, and you need to be willing to spend time on it. I don't think I will go back to another brand after using this."
4,Vortex vs Razor,"The main reason for using the vortex electric razor is for convenience of shaving. Also to reduce razor cuts. I like the cleaning/charging station. However, a manual razor still gives a much closer shave"
5,Very Satisfied with Shaver,"Switched over from a Braun shaver. This shaver, in terms of actually shaving, probably give me a closer shave than the Braun (but it could be because it is brand new). Battery charges lasts over a week, so it can easily be taken out of town without the charger. The real beauty in this machine is the cleaning mechanism. You can use the Vortex Hydraclean system, which does a great job of cleaning out the shaver. All the little hair particles are gone, and the blades actually shine like new. The best part is you dont even need to use the Vortex system, because the cleaning cartridges can get expensive. You can use just regular soap and water. I use hand soap, pump once into the blades, Turn on the shaver, and the soap starts to lather. Then while the shaver is still on, run water over it. And this works just as good, and there are instructions how to do this, in the box. All in all a excellent shaver. Also comes with carrying pouch."
5,Awesome!,"Review for Panasonic ES8077SSince my brother owns an older model and loves it, I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The problem that it solved for me was redness and irritation. After about two weeks my beard got used to the new shaver and there has been no redness, bumps or irritation. It shaves amazingly close. I've used it wet or dry and it works great either way. It's close, smooth, easy and convenient. Wish I had tried this years ago."
5,The Vortex is a keeper,"I have tried several times to switch from shaving with a standard razor to an electric. Every other time I have been disappointed. Not this time, however. The panasonic delivers a nice shave that doesn't irritate my face even close to as bad as the other electric shavers I have tried, specially if I shave in the shower. I don't think it shaves quite as close as a blade in the tough areas, but it's not significant. The auto clean is a nice feature as well. That was another big turn off to my previous electrics.It has a nice feel in my hand and the pivoting head action is nice.I'm glad I made the switch. No more buying blade cartridges."
4,Excellent product,I'd rate this product as excellent product but its not for sensitive skin as you can still get razor burns. overall nicely designed product but try before you buy
4,Excellent Shaver,"I purchased this for my husband who can no longer use a regular razor due to being on a blood thinner, he loves it, it's a little noisy when in the cleaning mode but he says it does a great job and is always clean and ready to use. I also purchased one for my son for christmas."
5,Takes a bit of getting use to,Taken a bit of getting use to but husband seems to be very happy with the product both wet and dry
5,Good product,I've used this product for more than 1 year to see if it held up and it did. It still delivers a very close shave and the base has a small footprint on my bathroom counter.
4,Vortex shaver,"Superior quality, give great shave. Good for sensitive skin. Cleaning system is a major plus."
4,Quiet and very fast blade!,"This razor is very quiet in comparison with my braun synchro. I initially bought it because I had hoped to use it in the shower and to shave my head. However, it caused quite a bit of razor burn on my head the first time I used it and there has not been a second time. It is excellent for your face (and maybe YOUR head). I like the cleaning system and the ease of use.Does it shave better than the Braun Synchro? Maybe....But not much better. If I had to do it over again, I probably would not spend the money on this razor. However, if I were to choose between it and the Braun, I would choose the Panasonic because of the wet/dry option and because it operates so quietly. It is an excellent razor!"
4,Excellent product,"Excellent wet/dry shaver. I wish it had more power, but overall I'm very satisfied."
4,Strong product but confusing instructions,"This is my first real experience with a quality electric shaver as I've been more inclined to use a manual razor. I think it does a strong overall job but the directions are a bit confusing. There also has to be a better way of throughly cleaning the unit inbetween cartridge changings. Close and clean shave and would suggest buying some extra cartridges, they last a month a piece."
1,Feels like a Toy,"After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to purchase it. They had it on sale @ Circuit City, but here at Amazon it was a better deal. My first initial thought was this razor seems kind of light. The plastic on it fells really frail. Well after using it for 2 days, I accidentally dropped it. On impact the head broke. I will return it for a refund and get a better brand. I still have my Braun 7680 that I bought 4 yrs ago. This razor was suppose to be the replacement. I will cut to the chase and just buy a newer Braun model."
1,less than a year of usage,i am using these wet and dry panasonic razors since 10 years because it is the only system that fits my skin. But i must say i had to change them a little more than every year. i thought that buying the most expensive one i would have a longer usage... no
3,"It's okay, but nothing is as close as a blade.","I've had nothing other than Norelco razers, but decided to try a different approach. This razer was highly rated so I decided to take the plunge. Is it really better than my Norelco? I really can't tell, but regardless of which razer I use, I've got to touch up with a blade.The bottom line is -- don't expect a real clean shave unless you've got a baby-face beard."
4,Good Electric Razor,A good electric razor for a good price. A decently close shave and I like the self cleaning action.
5,EXCELLENT!,Perfect... last years I used other razor and was bad experience. But this razor is excellent. Sure!
1,Very dissappointed - asked for a refund,"Hunh ... lot's of positive reviews, but I don't get it. The ""Vortex"" (should have been dubbed ""The Daisy"") just does not cut it. I have an old Braun 3612 with old dull blades. It cuts right thru the stiff (I say stiff, should say stiffer, my beard is really not that tough) hairs under my lip. The Panasonic ""Daisy"" shaver just sits there and cries. No joke.Honestly guys, this thing is really pretty bad. Think twice before you spend your money."
5,Great razor!,"I felt compelled to write a review since this razor is getting bashed on Amazon.I have had my Panasonic ES8077 for about 18 months (probably longer.) It provides the closest, smoothest shave I've ever experienced. The 8000 series Braun I owned never really shaved very well especially the hairs below the chin and on the neck (but kept it for awhile since it costs so much money).I see Braun's 9595 is using the same Linear motor as this Panasonic and costs twice the price. I couldn't imagine it would shave that much better than this shaver, so save your money and get one of these.I also like that it doesn't use alcohol for cleaning (an atmospheric pollutant.)"
5,Just Great!,"I have been using it for 1 month now, and its a great relief for my face, no irritation and very close shaving, the only con is the neck area, but that happens with every other shaver, the cleaner base is very nice and solid, its great to just leave the shaver there to clean, well if you have problem with irritation you have to try this, but if your hair is too thick maybe the 3 head rotors shavers works best for you.. just my 345 cents,"
2,Takes twice as long as my last razor,"I didn't really like the razor when I first got it but I was told that sometimes it just takes a while for skin to adjust to a new razor and that I should keep using it for a couple months. Well it didn't get any better and now it's too late to return it. Specifically, it takes twice as long to shave with the 8077 as it did with my last shaver (a remington) and often times no matter how hard or soft I press the razor leaves some hairs behind that I end up having to pull anyway. It's very frustrating to spend twenty minutes shaving and still not be able to get the job done."
2,Good razor if it doesn't break,"When I got this thing it was great.... very quiet and worked well.1 accidental 2 foot drop and the razor became incredibly loud from there on out. So loud it hurt my ears to shave. 2 months later it is dead as a doornail... won't even turn on. The battery is fine, but the razor is shot.The cleaner base does a great job.All things considered, this could have been a wonderful razor if it hadn't broken over a very minor jolt."
3,Great razor but questionable cleaning system,The Panasonic ES8077 is a great razor. The cleaning system stopped draining the fluid after 6 months. I clean and recharge the razor every weekend. I am thinking of replacing the system with another brand.
2,"Great razor, bad cleaning device","I have owned both the Braun and now the Panasonic razors with the automated cleaning device. Both razors work great for the first 366 days and then the cleaning device completely dies. The company won't repair it and you are stuck shelling out another $300 for a whole new system, despite the fact that the razor still works great. These companies need to construct both the razor AND the cleaning device with the same quality. Otherwise, there were no complaints: close shave, no nicks, works well."
5,Best electric razor,I have tried many electric razors but this on has by far been the best is shave as close as and bladed razor I've used.
3,A decent shave wet and an average shave dry.,"I was given this shaver as a gift last Christmas. Before that i was using a rotary shaver from Norelco. I was used to using the Rotary shavers but i wanted to try a foil for a while. I think this shaver gives a fair shave, not great. I'm at the point now where i have to wet my face and use Shaving Cream. With this method it does work pretty good. But i often want a quick shave without the hassle of shaving cream and wetting my face. My face was getting roughed up a bit, and it still does after months of use if i go dry. My old Norelco rotary shaves about as close and yes, i have compared several times and that's why i didn't throw out the old Norelco. But i will be looking at one of the Brauns as i want something that shaves better dry, and something less irritating."
4,a good razor,"According to my husband: This razor does a good job. However, if you only shave once a week (yes, some guys only shave once a week) it doesn't clean that well."
4,Great shaver,Well it is expensive and I am not impressed by the cleaning system. But I have used several dry and wet-dry shavers from Panasonic and Norelco over the years. This is the first razor or electric shaver I have ever used of any kind that does not irritate my skin. I am very happy with the shave quality. It gives a close shave without irritation in the throat area and has no trouble cutting anywhere. It also does not miss like some razors. I have used it anywhere from three days to 1/2 day of growth with no problem with missing or irritation.
2,just doesn't seem to work on my beard,"Pro* Looks cool* Interesting cleaning and charging station* Seems solidly constructed* Can use it in the showerCon* Just doesn't seem to be able to shave the hair on my chin. I have used this for 2 months (about 1-2 shaves a week). My beard hair is of regular thickness. I just don't understand why the shaver can't shave the upper neck and chin portion. It leaves patches of hair.Overall, it didn't work for me, but it seems that it works for most folks. I might just be the outlierGood luck with your shaver hunt."
4,"Great trimmer, but the cleaning system could be improved.","The trimmer itself is great. It's just about as smooth as a regular blade, and it doesn't cut or irritate the softer skin on my neck. It's nice that it can be used in the shower, though I mainly just use it in my car. The foil seems to last forever, as I've yet to notice it wearing down.My only complaint is the cleaning system. It doesn't seem to do anything to the razor, and the water inside it starts to stink fairly quickly, causing the razor itself to stink after cleaning. Maybe I got a bad cleaning cartridge. However, since this is a wet-dry razor, I just run it under some hot water whenever it needs it."
3,"more comfortable perhaps, but the Braun gives a much closer shave","I used the ES8077 for a couple of years, then bought an ES8228 last December. They were both OK. Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable. They're also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant. However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained. I recently switched to a Braun Series 7 and the shave is *much* closer and *much* faster."
3,Good Shaver. Some complaints.,The shaver shaves really well on the cheeks but neds multiple run throughs on the chin areas. Good battery life and nice grip on the shaver. panasonic could have given a better travel pouch for the shaver.
1,Not worth,"Shaving is average. After 4 months, the fan in the base started doing a weird noise. Sent it back for service (still under warranty). It took almost 2 months to get it back. The same problem persists. I gave up on Panasonic...is not worth"
1,don't waste your money,This piece of junk is poorly made and your can't get parts to repair it. Panasonic customer support is abominable.
4,"cool, usefull, fast shave, something to learns about it.","This's a very interesting product, it isn't heavy, but some kind of large, the shave is very close to other tradicional shaves (the blades). BUT to get the best shave do you have to learn how move this raizor, because on the contrary you will some areas with no shave. Take care about it, if you learn how to move, the right pression.. it's very good shaver."
1,"Close shave, but cleaning system is short lived!","This is my second ES8077. The first one lasted about 1 month before the base unit cleaning system quit working. I had to send the base and the shaver back at my expense for repair/replacement under warranty. After waiting over a month and shaving with my worn out Remington, I received a refurbished replacement unit, which was a slightly different model. That was just over a year ago. Now the second unit's cleaning system has quit working. The shaver still works fine and the charger works, the cleaning system just won't turn on. (This happened just after I bought 3 more expensive cleaning filters). I have changed filters regularly and kept the unit clean; the cleaning system just doesn't hold up well.In summary, the unit gives a decent close shave, but the cleaning system is junk! I wish I would have bought a Braun! Anyone want to buy some new cleaning filters? When the shaver head wears out I will definitely buy another brand!"
4,ES8077S,"I was very suprised on how close the shave was when I first used it and being able to use it in the shower is really nice. But after about 10 or 15 shaves you can tell it's time to replace something as it starts to grab you hair on occasion. Furthermore,it takes twice as long to shave with it then using a razor. So I just use it when Im in a rush to work and need to shave in the car. Lastly, it takes several passes around the the atoms apple and hard to reach place. Besides that it's a great razor for the price."
5,An Incredible Shaver!!!,"Finally, a shaver that performs as advertised. I have used all of the Norelco and Braun shavers out there and this is the first to actually shave my beard without razor burn. Truthfully, I had no transition period....none was necessary. I have been using this shaver for a week and have not had the first episode of razor burn or a poor shave. Incredible. My days of shaving cream are over! I have a very tough beard and usually have to trim up with a standard razor blade....not any longer! I am truly amazed at the quality of the shave I have gotten from this razor. Use in the shower or at the sink poses no problems, this is a very nice shaver. A definite buy...enjoy!"
3,Not Quite As Heavy Duty As Claimed...,"It is a moderately good tarp but barely worth about the 65 that it costs here, and, as another reviewer has noted (for a different size) it is NOT Heavy-Duty much less Super-Heavy-Duty. It is sturdier than the blue tarps one sees often. My tarp weighed about 14 lbs. giving an areal density of about 4.7 oz./sq. yd. Truly Heavy-Duty, 12 mil., 6 oz/sq.yd. tarps are available at about the same price including shipping at, for example, coversuperstoredotcom."
1,Junk,I had been using cheap tarps that I bought at Wal-Mart which did not last very long. I thought I would step up to a better grade and ordered these. They lasted about half as long as the Wal-Mart tarps for significantly more money. Don’t buy them.
2,18-by-24 Silver/Brown only lasted 20 months in the shade,I ordered two of these for a car tent. They are not as heavy duty as the White CANOPES I got from Orchard Supply Hardware.OSH brand lasted about 6 years. These lasted 20 months and are noticably thinner/lighter weight.I overlapped these silver/brown in the middle of my 35 foot run with the brown facing out/on top.One was in the sun for a few hours a day and has split 12 feet long at the middle where they glue panels together.It worked well until now. Made it by two winters but just 1.5 summers.Seemed to shrink a bit and have too much stress on the lap joint and pulled it apart.I will try looser bungie cords next time.Still the same price as back in Nov 2008.
1,"CHEEKY LIES, CELIACS BEWARE!!!","The above site clearly states that there is no gluten in this product. THAT IS A BLATANT LIE! Once I got the bottle the warning was printed on it (invisible in the picture above). MISLEADING, DECEPTIVE advertising. Shame on Amazon and on the manufacturer of this c*^#."
4,"Good reference, easy to follow and understand","Let me begin by explining that I have limited musical experience or training. However I do enjoy classical/syphonic music. This book greatly aided in my appreciation of the 40 pieces of music the author explains. His explanations are thorough and written in plain english. However, he does say to listen for certain instruments that most untrained people would not know. Although limited, I do know something about music so that fact that did not effect me. All in all a good book for those sick of the radio and wanting to expand their music collection. Also, gives great cocktail party knowledge."
5,Way too much fun!,"This book is just way too much fun to read. A friend of mine was reading it while in his bathroom, and resounding laughter echoed through out the whole house. Another cowboy who had recently read the book went out to check his mother cows, and found himself in the same situation as ""Ira"" and couldn't help busting into a laughing episode. This book is far from serious and if you need some good comic relief, it is a terrific perscription!"
5,Cleared Code best price,I shopped around for this product and found it cheapest here. Delivered in a timely manner and worked as expected.
4,Yemenite Shofar,"I am very pleased with the shofar, except for the mouth part. Apparently, the finish didn't reach near the mouthpiece so I am going to have to seal it myself. It will chip off if I don't, otherwise a nice shofar!"
3,"Three stars for reading, five stars for reference","This is a great comprehensive book on looking at different philosophies and religions coming from a Christian perspective. I give it three stars because Blanchard does remove his biases out very well at times. I would give it five stars as a reference book, becuase he does hit almost on everything and is very well referenced."
4,slappy trainer,"I have used these for many dogs and pups. I love it for teaching a pup not to sniff garbage or trash as you can place it under a trash sack and when the dog puts the head in to sniff it goes off without harm to the dog. Usually a dog learns after just a couple of times. That said, I have had times when like all training tools this didn't work. One dog comes to mind who knew that it only goes off once and would set it off then move the trap and then climb on the furniture anyway. Like all tools there is no perfect one for all dogs."
1,Murder on Martha's Vineyard,"Found this book confusing,disjointed,not easy to follow storyline or characters.Probably will not read other books in series"
1,"Oh, please....give us some credit !","This is the most ridiculous, over-blown mystery I have ever read. David Osborne has missed his calling - he should be writing heaving bosom fiction for the supermarket racks. Calm down, David. Try for a little logic in your plot. Nothing in this book is believable except for the descriptions of the Vineyard."
1,Don't buy these If you enjoy sour cherries!,For all you 'Jersey Cherries' lovers. These are not good. They left out all the sour and replaced it with just sugar.
4,"Good Book, On time","I received this book in the time I expected and it was inexpensive so I'm pretty happy with the selection. The only thing I would say in the con column is that the seller marked this as in ""Very Good"" condition, but the book jacket was noticeably used, wrinkled, and slightly ripped. Possible happened in the shipping process, but not an accurate assessment upon receipt. Otherwise I was quite pleased."
2,Ignores alternative methods of recovery,"This book focuses exclusively on achieving sobriety through Alcoholics Anonymous, and it (unfortunately) ignores any other way to quit drinking. Numerous studies -- as well as common sense -- show that alcoholics/addicts are a diverse group, and that many people benefit from approaches OTHER than those that are based on the 12 steps. AA is fine for people who have a religious or spiritual bent, but other groups (like Secular Organizations for Sobriety and SMART Recovery) are appropriate for alcoholics who want to become sober without relying on a Higher Power.This book would have been much better if it had been written from a more open-minded perspective."
5,Finally a book for family and friends!,"Thanks to these authors for putting together a resource for the significcant others of those affected alcoholics and drug addicts. While, so many self help books written for family members label those who want to help as co-dependents, this one does not! Instead, I was able to read about several options I have as a parent of an addicted teenager to help him. As a result, I was able to find several teen oriented support meetings that my son can has gone to and I feel that I have helped him...finally! Thank You!!"
2,modern-day stereo mediocrity,"Sound quality okay; generally clean good for background music and ambient audio when hooked up to video system. Power good, but lack of decent tone controls limits musical enjoyment, however. Typical of many new-age units, the lack of [meaningful] bass/treble controls make it hard to tailor the sound to any environment. There are only five settings each, and they provide minimum boost over a very limited spectrum. This is why they invented equalizers."
3,Slight Problem,"Overall, the movie was great. The only problem I saw in it, or that at least confused me, is when all of a sudden it seemed the movie was cut with a scene from another Mencia movie.But again, overall, the movie was great."
5,DVD carlos mencia,"I thought this dvd was great. For any Carlos Mencia fan this is a must have. This dvd showed up when amazon said it would, in great condition."
5,Histerical,Totally histerical ... saw Carlos Mencia in concert.. you will love the dvd. Worth the money
1,An embarrassment to the art of Comedy,"First off, this man has been notoriously known to steal jokes. As such, I wanted to see how his delivery of them were.And even by that, I was disappointed. He also belittles you without even knowing it; he tends to explain his ""jokes"" after he executes them by yelling almost incoherently. Gee Carlos, thanks. I never would have guessed the meaning of, ""beaners"" unless you had explained it to me.This man is a complete embarrassment to comedy. He steals jokes, ruins the execution of them, and thinks yelling to explain them is hilarious."
3,"Good, not great","Devil's Messenger is an awful movie, the other two are pretty good, although Lon Chaney isn't really the star."
1,Not even basic enough but they try to sell you service,It is a CD with very limited explnation as what to do. it even does not have a letter for Experian ineasted it has a letter with a phone number and when I called it guess what it is a service they try to sell you. so it is more of a company advertisement rather than professional help!
1,Accessing the information?,"This book has some useful information, but look at the index! The loan entry has about 20 page numbers with no information about what's on those pages. What good is a reference-type book when you can't access the information in it?"
2,Entertaining but...,"Our house is right-wing (the adult decision makers are anyways). That being said this publication has clearly taken a left turn and potrays itself as a bunch of liberals taking gabs at our beliefs and values. Even so, this is a good tool to get a school age child interested in politics and world happenings. We will not keep it coming after the intrest is sparked, we will switch to something that better potrays our conservitive ideology."
3,brings back memories,I loved mad when i was younger much younger. Now that I'm over the hill I wanted to see if it could still tickle my funny bone and for the most part it did. True some of the current fad references I didn't get but hey I did say I'm over the hill. The one thing I didn't like was the politics with my humor. I get enough of that lefty garbage on and in the main stream entertainment as well as news. I did really appreciate it in my satire.
1,Don't order through Amazon.com,I ordered the magazine subscription on 12/29 the first magazine will not arrive until after may 1st. I do not recommend ordering magazines through amazon.com
4,It's Been Along Time Coming......,It's been a long time since I picked up a MAD magazine and browsed through the pages...and even though some of the more famous contributors have gone to the big black hole in the sky...there is still some smart answers to stupid questions. I found the issue i picked up still was just as funny as the one I picked up more than two decades ago for the first time.A few of the original contributors add a little spice to the newer issues but the new gags are just as gaggable as the old ones so take a chance and page through a issue you old fogey..I think you'll get a couple of good chuckles out of the experiance..and enjoy all the news that is fit to print one more time.
4,Grandson's favorite!,"This mag was my son's favorite & has come full circle & become my grandson's!Go, Mad Magazine!!Talk about staying Power!!"
1,Very Disappointed,If I could I would rate this no stars. I had ordered this magazine subscription in December 2010 as a Christmas gift and never had received it and it is now May. I did call and talk to Amazon and they contacted the company that owns the magazine and still no magazine in the mail. Very disappointed with the service on the magazines end at trying to get this magazine subscription and ended up being a very late non-exsistent Christmas gift. I am getting a refund.
1,takes longer than estimated for delivery,I ordered on 11/2/10 and just checked the status because I haven't received it yet. It won't be delivered until 3/2/11. That is 4 months. That is is ridiculous!
1,"needs new writers, not dems.","goes after the right, more weirdos on the left. -canceld my subscription.this mag used to be fun!"
4,Tea Tree Love,"I love tea tree oil and I use it for everything. I use it for my skin, clears out pores, and cleaning my home, especially around pet smells. It is very strong and should be used sparingly but it lasts a long time."
5,The Perfect Wedding invitations!,Goddesses for a Goddess on her big day! We used these as our wedding invitations. We had our info printed on card stock and used photo corners to attach it to the inside of the cards. The variety of art allowed us to choose a design that best matched each guest. The RSVPs came back with comments on the beautiful artwork of both the cards and the envelopes.
4,My Macbook has skin!,"I got this because my roomate has cats, and I was noticing hairs making their way into my keyboardand I wasn't to excited about little hairs working thier way into my keyboard.My first impression of this is that it feels great, it's got a great texture and doesn't leave marks on my screen like I got before I started using this. It really fits perfectly on to the keyboard even though it does affect my typing a little bit but I feel it's worth it for the protection I'm getting."
3,"Shipped quickly, but poor quality.","My keyboard cover arrived quickly. I have had it for about two months, and the skin is ripping. It has ripped from the track pad all the way to the edge of the computer. It would be a perfect product if it were a little thicker to withstand my typing action. Next time I think I will purchase one that is more like a sticker to my computer so it has no chance of movement."
4,Long lasting,"Ive had this keyboard cover for 2 years and its still in perfect condition. i thought the white letters on the buttons would start fading or rubbing off by now, but it looks like when i just bought it. im not sure if its me or not, but where i place my palms on the left and right of the touch pad below the space bar, theres slight wear that occured under the skin. i dont know if the cover has a chemical in it that took some of the finish off or i just have really heavy hands? overall: i like it"
4,Protection at it's best,Really good at protecting my apple. The material seems to attract a lot of dust.
3,"Works, Fn keys mislabeled","The function keys on new macbooks now control iTunes playback (a nice feature) and have been shuffled around to reflect this. While my new rasfax keyboard cover fits nicely over my keyboard, the function keys are printed with the wrong set of symbols. It's kind of a shame. Otherwise I might have given this product four stars, because protecting my 'book is a big concern for me."
4,funny and interesting,Unmentionable is a good book because: it's funny and interesting. Our favorite story in the book was the Birdman.Birdman is about a boy named Spider and his friends Sean. Sean foundn a crate on the beach and he opened it and found that a hat was in it and that the hat opened it's eyes and made the person wearing it copyed what it saw We can't tell you any more
4,Agreeable Music,The music of N.Rota is very agreeable and the performer is a sensitive and refined musician
4,"An excellent, modern book, both scholarly and accessible.","Books about ancient cultures tend to be either slightly soft-focus and ""fluffy"" or dry and almost excessively scholarly; neither approach succeeds in bringing a culture to vivid life for the interested lay reader. This book, however, does just that. It has scholarly evidence in detail, but also fleshed-out conclusions, and unflinchingly looks even at evidence that doesn't ""fit"" our modern image of ancient peoples we want to like, in its quest to bring us a living, breathing image of the Minoans. (It also has illustrations in plenty; I feel a bit juvenile to admit this, but I very much appreciate illustrations, as no verbal description can quite convey the brushstrokes, the maze-like floor plans, the quality of line.)It's not a perfect book---I agree with another reviewer who complained that people probably had more houses and fewer temples than Mr. Castleden concludes ---but it is an excellent one, especially for an ""armchair archaeologist""."
1,There are better options.,"Aegean Prehistory has lacked authoritative introductions but now see Cynthia Shelmerdine, Cambridge Companion to Aegean Prehistory, 2008. Soon also Eric Cline's comparable book for Oxford. All contributors are leaders in their field."
1,Dallas meets the Dark ages,"I can't believe the positive reviews which with, but a few exceptions, have been given this book.First of all, there are glaring historical inaccuracies throughout the book which basic research should have eliminated - for instance the extent to which the indigeneous Britons were Romanized after three centuries of occupation is ignored.Even as a story it is weak and badly told. The main characters are unconvincing and badly developed. They tend to be stereotypes (i.e. noble Roman soldier representing ancient values, depraved aristocrat representing the new) rather than convincing formed personalities .The 5th century with its background of collapse of civilisation is a fascinating period which has been well covered before. Read the grimly realistic Arthurian triology of Bernard Cornwell or even the far superior young adult books of Rosemary Sutcliff and don't waste your time on this trash."
5,Loved it!,"I have read this series before, many times, and never tire of it! Out of all the Arthurian legends, this is my favorite since it incorporates actual history in a manner that makes it seem possible."
3,Highly readable historical fantasy.,"The book is an enjoyable addition to the Arthurian literature genre. I do agree with those who deem the book historical fantasy. It is not historically accurate, although that doesn't distract from the reading pleasure (unless you feel it necessary to compile a list of errors as you go along). The book was well written with interesting characters. I found myself looking for excuses to keep reading (at stop lights, at lunch etc.), which is the sign of a good read."
2,Not for me,"I chose this book because it was outside my comfort zone of what I usually read and it didn't work out too well. There was too much fighting, battling and military strategy in it for me - most of it went over my head. I think that someone who likes that sort of thing would probably like this book though."
3,"Fun, light reading.","While not particualrly literary, Whyte's take on Roman and Anglo-Saxon Britain is a fun read. Everything and everyone was a little too perfect, i think (especially in ""the Colony""), but hey, it's supposed to be the epic of Arthur--things can be a little grand!"
2,overrated,"I was disappointed by the very thin character development for female characters, and by very pompous and unnatural dialogue.Definitely the male equivalent of romance fiction."
3,Don't Expect Too Much,"I will say in defence of those who ""rave"" over this book - its fun for junk reading. Like other reviewers, I found this book to be poorly written, some gratuitous sex, homophobic in its presentation of the psychotic villain as the first and only homoerotic male presented in the book - imagine in Roman Britain... The female characters are disappointing. Also at times rather anachronistic. It makes me sad that so many reviewers clearly read this book as if it were history - BIG mistake. Read it as a fun escapist easy and quick read. Try to ignore its flaws if those things matter to you - or skip this book/series if you can't get past the inaccuracies, p/c problems, and weak writing/plot development. I probably won't continue on to the rest of this series."
1,Camulod Chronicles as a Series,"Jack Whyte's series, the Camulod Chronicles, starts out laying a strong foundation on which to build Arthurian legend. The problem is that he never constructs much of an Arthurian legend. He spends about 6-7 of the 9 books building up to Arthur, and then when Arthur becomes a man he is but a secondary character who is not very involved in the books. I was extremely disappointed by this series and would recommend readers not to pick it up. If you are looking for a good Arthurian tale, look no further than Bernard Cornwell's 'Winter King' series. It is spectacular and I would read it 100 times before reading Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles again."
1,Very Disappointing,"I saw this book on the book shelf and picked it up, thinking ""Hey, I love historical fiction. I wonder what the author can do with Arthurian Historical Fiction! "" However, I was unable to get past the first 100 pages, for several reasons. First of all, I found the character developement rather weak, the sex and language rather overused, and a weak grip of historical accuracy haunted this book. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with sex or violence in a book, but in this peice I found that the swearing gave the book a clogged-up character and was rather distracting. It didn't seem natural, it didn't flow. If you want to read some good historical fiction, read ""Gates of Fire"" by Steven Pressfeild. Although it's not about Arthur, it has violence, sex and profanity well interlaced with historical accuracy and sympathetic characters which creats a much more solid book than this peice. All in all, I was very disappointed."
4,great series - leaves you wanting more,"I have recently finished the entire Camulod Chronicles in a matter of a few weeks after picking up one of the books by chance. While, as with any books of much length (these are 450 pages and up), there were a few spots that dragged, on the whole, I found the entire series not only entertaining, but educational as well. My only comment is now that I am done with the series, I don't know what to do with myself. A definite must read for anyone with an interest in Arthurian legends. I enjoyed the different take on a familiar story."
2,"Interesting Premise, Lackluster Execution","I was intrigued by the concept of a historically-based retelling of the Arthur legend, but found this book disappointing. The beginning is promising enough, with a terrific action sequence, but the rest of the book is hampered by stilted dialogue and explicit but stilted sex scenes. Also, the narrator, Varrus, is an expert soldier in the Roman military, but his Christian conscience fills him with guilt after killing. The result: He slaughters scores, then pukes his guts out in self-revulsion. Not the most subtle way to portray a conflicted character."
5,one of the best,My son has watched these since he was about 9 months old. He's three now. He loved to see the rocket blast off. The stories are well thought out and have music and dancing. Kids are picky you just have to spend the money and take a chance they will like it. Hey adults will like it!
3,no French language track as advertized,"This video claims to have a French language track, but it doesn't. I have bought other Backyardigans DVDS with French language tracks for my bilingual family and they are great (SuperSecret SuperSpy, for instance), but this one is not as advertized (and I was really looking forward to watching how they'd translate the Samurai Pie episode!)."
4,The BackYardigans Are Fantastic!!!!,"I am totally in love with the backyardigans. I bought this for my sons 2nd birthday, but now I'm hooked. I would recommend this to any parent who wants their child to learn while watching animation. To me the backyardigans teach children how to use their imagination and children today need that instead of video games or cartoons with violence."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Based on the reviews I read, I was expecting a closer shave. Though it often claims to shave nearly as close as a traditional bladed razor, logic should have convinced me otherwise. It does not shave nearly that well. Additionally, the maker would lead you to believe that it is virtually impossible to cut yourself with this unit, yet I managed to do just that in a (private) area of very soft, flexible skin. On the other hand, if you just want a compact motorized shaver that can shave close (for its kind), this is probably a decent unit. However, for the price, I'm not sure it would be competitive in that class. I found nothing impressive with the other two trimmers in this trio, either."
1,Not satisfied,The product is not upto the mark. The quality is not as mentioned.The physical appearance looks as if it's a very cheap product..I am not satisfied with this product so far.
2,don't buy this version...,"although it's the only german version to ship directly from amazon.com, it's fraught with typos and inaccurate punctuation. i give it two stars because it'll get the job done, but buy ""effi"" through a 3rd party seller and you'll be much happier."
1,"""It doesn't work at all!","""The reason I purchased this product is because of the promise to clean just about anything."" I have a few small rust spots on a bathroom floor and a I wanted to try it on oil in my driveway. This stuff is a joke. It not only didn't work at all, it has a citrus odor that is horrible! The rust stains are just sticky now and the oil stains are there and not at all cleaned up. Read the statements.. this spray cleaner is supposed to cut through grease and grime and everything else it touches. You are better off with Industrial cleaners that you know and trust can do the job. This product was a complate waste of money and time!"
3,Didn't remove the adhesive off my brick,"I got this to remove adhesive that had melted onto the brick of my house. I sprayed it on, and the first thought was, ""Should I be wearing a respirator?"" This stuff has a strong chemically odor that is somewhat masked by a faint citrus smell. After intense scrubbing, the adhesive has not budged. It did seem to clean the brick...making this area slightly lighter than the rest of the house. Sigh...."
1,You sent the wrong product,You mailed to me Xenit Mold Cleaner. So I still don't have the Xenit Citrus Cleaner and Remover - 10 oz. product.I can't rate it.............I never got it..............but if I have to rate so you can get this message I will.
5,The Story of Pancho and the Bull with the Crooked Tail,Excellent!! Great pictures and story - can't believe this book hasn't been reprinted and isn't available in libraries.
1,Stay away,"When I ordered mine, it came and was practically already dried out, could not use it at all. My cousins had this when they were little and i remember it as being fun. Ordered as a gag gift for a friend. Don't remember such a harsh smell from it way back when, it really smells bad now. Very Chemically smelling. I would stay away from this item for kids."
5,Unbelievably penetrating,"I feel like I could hear Andrei Ridgeway talking to me as I read this book. I've never read such a calm, steady, directed and -- effective! -- book. Loved it, and use it almost daily."
4,GIFTED,"I love the Clark Sisters and when I heard Kierra's CD I was like ""Yep she has the gift."" Overall to me the CD could have been better, the upbeat songs were good, but if the CD had at least two more songs like ""Praise Offering"" it really would have been awesome. I liked the Tonex produced song also...by the way when is Mrs. Tonex coming out with an album because the song sounds just like her. Kierra's voice is another welcome additon to gospel music and I hope that she stays focused and keeps up her instrument to continue to give GOD the glory like only she can!"
5,GAWDT!,"This young lady can sang. Not ""sing"", sang. She has been blessed greatly with her powerful vocals.My Top Favorites:You Don't KnowLet GoChurch NitePraise OfferingSweetest ThingWarDone It AllSnap (Hidden Track)Don't wait until someone else catches the holy ghost from this album, get it yourself!"
1,Kierra is too talented to put out crap like this,"Kierra Sheard is too talented to put out crap period, let alone the crap she's got on her record. She is too strong as a vocalist to be paired with producers who are used to working with singers who need their voices drowned out with electronic beats. Her talent is overshadowed on EVERY SINGLE SONG. It was such a disappointment that I threw the CD in the trash.Please don't buy it."
4,"Good CD, but nothing special","Maybe it's just me, but I don't see the ""special quality"" about her voice. I guess whn she was younger and sounded like that, but now it's normal to hear someone her age sound like she does. No doubt she does have talent and we get to hear voice in the song ""Church Nite"". I give her CD a 3.5-4, because the songs and delievery are good, but I don't like how the comments by Mary Mary and different A&R's as her being the future of gospel and having a superb voice. Her voic is not that special...I can sing better than that. But without a doubt she is very talented, but her mom has her beat. Yolanda Adams has them both"
4,Don't pay any attention to the 2 negative reviews-,"This book is excellent for women as Joyce addresses many women's fears of ""bulking up""and helps them get lean,small toned muscles. Also,I would like to address the two comments rearding the ""ugly fat"" comment. I think there are always going to be people who will look for any excuse to not do what they know they should do.A perfect example of this is the comment of a reader from cambridge. I think this person is easily offended,and way too sensitive.I doubt very much that Joyce was refering to fat people w/the term ugly fat,it makes more sense that she was refering to fat itself being ugly,which it is,it is gobbly,gooey,and disgusting,it not only makes your body mushy and flabby,but it clogs your arteries,and in most cases will kill you,that is fact."
5,Excellent book!!,"If you negative reviewers already feel so great about yourselves, then why did you buy the book in the first place? You wouldn't need to purchase something to make you feel or look better if you already felt that way. You bought it for the same reason the rest of us did and you know it. We all want to look that good, even if we don't want to admit it out loud.Joyce's books are the bomb! They are motivational and inspiring and are helping me to get in shape and get healthier for ME and ME alone. She looks great and she's 26 years older than I am, for pete's sake!! If she can do it, then I KNOW I can too!"
3,Serpent,This toy was alright in use. Kids seem to quickly find it boring. It is a good piece as decoration and sets up the right atmosphere for fun
1,Pretty useless,"After finally blowing it up, my 6 nephews, niece, and two grandchildren ages 3-16 couldn't wait to ride. The older kids found it boring and the younger kids could not use it at all. It flips and is very hard to get on and one you are on you will fall off. I don't know how anyone found this a fun toy. I will be returning it."
2,Save your money,"I purchased this float for a gift for my brother in Florida. It arrived when we did for a visit. My 4 children and the 3 from across the road had a lot of fun with this toy for 2 days. We left for Disney World and returned the next week, only to find the Serpent had deflated. We blew him back up and by the next day he had lost most of his air. Obviously he had a hole (or more). We watched the kids play with the serpent on the 2 days they used it, and they didn't play with it too roughly. It never left the pool, so I'm not sure when it got a hole in it. I would think for $20.00 we would have had more than 2 days use with it before it had received a hole in it! Very disappointed, and that's why I gave only 2 stars and advise you to save your money. I buy new pool floats every year for my pool, because, yes, they will lose their air, and they just get gross after using them for 1 season and then storing them for another 3 seasons. But this didn't even make it through the week!"
4,Review of fishing book.,Overall good basic fishing book. Covers all types of fresh water fishing & equipment. Author injects some personal humor that makes reading fun.
5,"Just when you thought you knew all the answers, you learn more",I really like this book. It was a good refresher and a good reference manual if you want to get back into fishing and have been away for a while. There are some new techniques in here that look promising that I plan to try soon.
4,What Fish Don't Want You to Know,This book was bought as a Christmas present for a freshwater fisherman. He seems to be enjoying reading it so far.
4,Essential Stuff to Get You Going,"Before I bought this book, I've been fishing about 8-10 times. I really don't care for fishing because I'm so bad at it. But this year I decided to give it a try again but this time I wanted to research the sport instead of going out there like clueless. To get me started, I bought two fishing books: this one and another rather thick book.What I like about this book is that it gives you the most important info you need to make you a decent fisherman. For now, I don't want a book that gives me a PhD in fishing. I just want to have a decent clue when going out, and that's exactly what this book did for me. It's not at the Dummy level nor is it at the pro-fisherman level either... right in the middle where I wanted things. Meanwhile, my other thick book sits there collecting dust. Maybe I'll get to that other book sometime, but for now this book has given me enough to try out for several outings."
4,How to learn and laugh,Very interesting techniques and narrative. The author is witty and sage. I've reread several sections and found the advice to be sound. Can't wait to try some of his techniques on the water!!
5,There should be some frightened fish out there now...,"This is the best book of it's kind I've read. The author uses a lot of common sense and he doesn't make you feel like you need to spend big bucks on gear. It also has really nice touches of humor. You can really tell this guy loves to fish, loves his surroundings, and loves to write. This book will make a great gift and improve my ""luck"". I hope Frank Baron keeps writing and gets some well deserved recognition. Buy this book."
4,read this to catch a lunker!!!,This book is very informative. It will help you understand the fish more so catching a trophy will be an easier job!
4,Good for Basics,I purchased the book for my wife. No one in her family had ever hunted or fished and her knowledge was zero. She has enjoyed and gotten a lot out of the book. Good solid basic information about fishing.
3,pretty good book more stories than insights,I liked the book. I thought that there were better stories than insights though. Overall I would buy the book again but was looking for a little more...
5,Get into the fish's head!,"This book was an excellent insight into how fish think. It was fairly introductory, and there was probably a lot that a seasoned fisherman would already know, but I found it enjoyable. It seemed to have a lot of info about protecting the sport, and had somewhat of an ""us versus them"" feel when talking about people who were against fishing. A fun, quick read for anybody who wants to know a little bit more about fish and their habits, some strategies for catching them, or if you just want to get away into your own head when the weather isn't cooperating for you to get out on the water."
5,I can now feed my family :D,"This book was incredibly fun to read. I used to be the average fisherman bringing back nothing for the family. After reading Frank's book I bring back a feast, the fish have no chance. I recommend this book to everyone, it may even teach you pros a thing or two."
3,Simple tips,"There really isn't much in this book that your grandpa didn't already teach you.Would I recommend this book to a friend? No. If you know absolutely NOTHING about fishing, then buy this book. But if you know the basics already, skip it."
4,Odd usage,I used this to find steel pellets in the birds that I hunt. After realizing that many birds have pellets in them(even from before with healed wound channels) I tried this as a way to find undesirable pellets that are hard on your teeth. After a hunt I found 11 pellets in the ducks and geese that I harvested. As I eat everything that I hunt this makes the dining much more enjoyable. Just be careful to have no metal underneath as this will detect it though the wood top.
1,Plastic Junk,"I just paid almost $40 for a piece of plastic junk. Made in China, very poor quality, worked off and on for about ten minutes then stopped. Don't waste your money."
3,Beware of reviews,"This product works somewhat as described. The area of the detector that acrually scans is very small. I purchased this item because Rockler (andmost everyone else) was out of the Lumber Wizard and the reviews of this item seemed so positive. After re-reading the reviews, it seems some could have been written by the same person. (You'll notice two seperate people have dads who like STUFFS. In other words, beware of the reviews."
3,Works adequately.,"Not as sensitive as I'd like. I use it to check for metal buried in reclaimed wood. It doesn't work past about 1/2"" deep which has caused me to trust a couple of pieces of wood that later ruined my band saw blades. It's really best for nails and staples near/on the surface which can be found with careful visual inspection alone. Limited usefulness."
5,Ragg topp,"This product, used on a regular basis provides superior protection and waterproofing. I highly recommend this product after using a porsche based product in the past. I would not use any other product on my SAAB."
5,Car gru,Excellent product but I have since been told that it is a silocone based product which is not good for the fabric. It really repels the water though and have no complants. I would buy again.I have tried other similar products but none are as good as this.Holds up very well under repeated washings.
5,Great results,"I bought the kit and this as an extra can to have on hand. I read many reviews before going with the RaggTopp protectant. Another brand had good reviews, but I've seen this on AutoGeek and other websites as being approved by manufacturers. Plus, I have a friend who used it on his car recently and it made a huge improvement in the appearance of the top. I have the same model car, (2006), with a top that had never been treated, but was in a little better shape than his.The RaggTopp went on easily, (in my garage), using most of the can for two coats. If you follow the directions and allow it to dry completely between coats, (better if you take it out in the sun), you will get a great result. My black top is darker and newer looking after cleaning it with the RaggTopp cleaner and applying the protectant."
4,RaggTopp Fabric Protectant,"Works well as long as you don't wash the top. Even using RaggTopp's cleaner, a soft brush or cloth, it removes the protectant from the top requiring a weekly or more reapplication to repel rain or morning dew. That gets expensive at $20 per container."
4,Get two cans,The spray worked very well. It went on good and repells water great. I used it on my 99 eclipse and one can was only good for one good coat. If you follow the instructions and apply 2 coats you will need two cans.
4,Water rolls right off.,"Excellent product. I use it to treat my fabric top every Fall and it lasts all through the rainy season to repel water and everything else. Even after a wash with the RaggTopp detergent, the beading action is still quite strong. A little care must be taken when applying the spray because if it gets on the paint, trim or glass, it's a pain to remove. I mask off everything except for the top which takes some time. I highly recommend this for your convertible top."
2,Did not work for my cloth top,"I used this on the black cloth top of my convertible. It was leaking when parked out in the rain. I brought it to a mechanic who recommended this product.I took some advice from other reviews and ordered 2 cans, using most of them on about 4 coats. I was hopeful, but the cloth top still leaks, granted not as much as before. There is no visible difference -- the cloth still looks like it is soaking water in.Two stars because it helped a bit, but did not solve the problem."
1,Careful!,"I used to use the Vinyl top version of this product on my 97 Miata and it kept the tan top in absolutely perfect condition. No cracking, discoloration etc. Great.So I thought to use the same brand on the grey fabric top of my new Boxster.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Although the water repelling feature is there, the grey is now a lot darker overall, and a different, lighter shade where the fabric is under higher tension (above the frame rails). It really did a ""job"" on the top. Looking closer, it appears that the solvents attack the vinyl layer underneath the fabric and some of it's dark color leaks along the fabric's fibers to the top.Do the product developers at Ragtopp know how much a new top for a Boxster costs ?!!?So, unless your top is really ragged and needs this for some other reason, stay away from it! I learnt it the hard way."
5,Cumberland General Store,Great catalog of old fashioned goods. 256 pages. Still in business but moved to Georgia.
4,Good for technique,"This book is well written but it will not help you to jump start your acting career. If your looking to have a career as an actor, study read this book,take classes and then get a workbook, like Twelve Step Plan To Becoming An Actor by Dawn Lerman and Dori Keller. It will give you tangible ADVICE ON HOW TO GET YOUR CAREER MOVING .Jim StevensLA"
4,Great guide!,"I bought this guide prior to going up to the Catskills near the area of Tannersville, Hunter Mountain and the Catskill Falls, and the guide was a great help in finding nice trails in the area with great text and indicative sketches of the trails.However, you will need a decent topographical map with compass indications and height measures, which is not provided with these crude maps. Therefore, you should seriously consider the Catskills Mountain Guide as it has a great map of the entire Catskill region, but with less detail for each specific area."
2,No directions from Highway exits,"Seems to have all the info except ""how to reach the trail staring from HW exit"". I was expecting direction starting from nearest highway exit and was not able find. I live in Long Island, and not familiar with Catskill area so direction is very important for me. I do not like to waste time searching for trailheads.In spite of this -ve things, I gave 2 starts because it has lot of historic data."
5,Pennsylvania Railroad,The book was purchased used and the only damage was to the dust cover. The book covered the PRR good and had several actual photos of the equipment in use . Provided good sound history and data provided for that period was excellent manner. This was a good purchase and glad I made it.
5,"Very fast, awesome burner",I just got this burner tonight and tried it out for the first time. I burned 10 songs in a minute and a half. So far this burner is great.
1,this was the worst product I've ever bought!!! And I own a Dell!!!,"I was really excited the day I got this burner, but I wasn't expected so many problems for so many hours. It's probably a compatibility issue with Windows XP, but why is this the case if it's a new product? The company has no helpful troubleshooting documents or services, the software they give you is unnecessary, and I'm just getting madder and madder just thinking about how long it took to figure out it wasn't going to work! Don't buy it if you have Windows XP."
1,Worst product ever. What a hassle.,"Wow, you know those headaches you get when a product is so poor, and then you have to go through the hassle of sending it back? First of all, I opened the box and found that the manufacturer had forgotten to include the power cables and USB cable as promised. Using my own compatible cables, I hooked up the drive, and then the pain began. The drive made my computer hang every time I put in a disc. An absolutely disastrous product. I have Windows XP as well, but I don't think that's the problem. The computer recognized the drive, but everything stopped once I put a disc in. And the instructions that come with the drive look like they were mimeographed 30 years ago. My drive doesn't even look like the one illustrated in the directions. Terrible."
2,Albert Einstein non-action figure,"Probably the most boring of the action figure sets, the Albert Einstein figure, next to the Sigmund Freud Action Figure, is not a whole lot of fun. The Albert Einstein figure has a big paunch, protruding potbelly. He doesn't have any weapons, no accessories, no brain even, so you'll be bored by him. This is the guy who gave us the A-Bomb and sold out to the military."
5,Another Great Sideshow Spike figure,"This is another Spike figure from Sideshow that has an excellent sculpt. The first was in human form while this one is a vampire. Spike comes with several good accessories including a skull, shotgun and amulet and if you get the exclusive version you get a Hawaiian shirt as well. He is dressed in the same outfit as human Spike sans the red shirt under the coat so it will be a similar look but in vamped out face. Nicely done."
5,Ralph Moody,"When I was a child I read Little Britches, Man of The Family, and Horse of a Different Color. These books/stories are timeless. Any parent who wants to give a good example to a child about resposibility should obtain these."
4,Legal and illegal file sharing information,"This book is a lot of fun. It covers both legal and illegal aspects of file sharing, primarily of finding music, movies, hacked software and adult entertainment. He covers a variety of file sharing networks and applications. But the primary value of the book is in the experience he impart. The etiquette of file sharing, how to secure your files and avoid the security problems.The coverage is fairly high level. You won't be getting step-by-step instructions in how to rip DVDs. The topics are covered, but the author generally leaves it to you to navigate all of the features of any particular application.This book is better than the shoddy cover would imply, but the organization could have used some work. Definitely worth a look for those interested in doing a lot of file sharing."
4,The other side,"It's a nice overview book. Goes into how musicians, writers and other artists can use file sharing to get attention outside the large media outlets, which is probably why the large media outlets ignore this subject.There's the downside, mostly spyware, and Wang goes into that. His interview was good on First Voice Books (www.firstvoicebooks.com/filesharing.html).I think file sharing will grow up as the years go by and morph into a tool for companies and associations to distribute their work. Is it just a dream? Yahoo, MSN and Google don't think so."
4,Steal this file sharing book,The book blatantly explains how to get around the web in the simplest formats that will help elude anyone from virus'. I think this book is great because it also brings up a lot of good points about the productivity of newsgroups and how they can be used for more than just politics. Basically each chapter is broken down into segments of what your searching for on the internet and how to find it in places you would not usually think of right away. check this book.
2,OK to a point . . .,Last chapter spoiled the book by ambushing the reader with an inappropriate socialist political agenda. Klein is supposed to be a science journalist.
5,Wow!,"For fans of Futurama, this is the ultimate calendar. Each month is illustrated with an original piece of Futurama art. Each one is funnier than the last. I really recommend this calendar for all science fiction fans."
5,great,I like this book because it is fond to read and to learn how to write a good essay. I love it!
2,Connector is not designed properly,The connector pins are not long enough. In order to get the device to charge you have to use a lot of pressure pushing the connector into the device. To get it to work I have to push the connector in as hard as I can then wrap the cord around the device to keep the pressure. Other than that the charger is ok.
5,No computer necessary :-),These chargers arrived quickly and in individually sealed packages (eventhough the box was somewhat crushed). They work great! It was so nice to bring my MP3 player on vacation without having to lug around my laptop. Price was excellent as well.
4,This product works great.,It has been a while since I purchased this product and this product has performed flawlessy. I was little leary to purchase it at first because of it's low price . This is a good product.
5,Seems too good 2 b True,"I was surprised that this product actually works and works great.The home charger allows u to charge and play at the same time, the USB hookup dont. I use my sansa at work and it was a hassle to bring it into the house and charge it almost every night. Now I just leave it hooked up to the car charger and its charging on the way to and from work. I especially luv the home charger, its multi-voltage and will work at my island home in the Philippines. But how can they sell it for under 3 bucks? it cost more to ship it. But I will reccomend this product to my sansa buddies."
1,Charger doesn't fit my Sandisk Sansa e280R player,"The review refused to permit no star; otherwise that is what I would have given it. Unfortunately the recharger dock connector cable simply will not plug into my Sandisk e280R. Since no instructions came with the recharger I must assume that either the ""R"" extension on the e280R makes it incompatible with the recharger or else both of the rechargers are defective. The advertising did not indicate any difference between e280 series and e280R. It would cost more time and effort to return than it would be worth."
4,They work,There is not much to review - they work. One AC charger was a little hard to onplug from the MP3 - but I may have been because it was new.
5,"Great price, works aas advertised",The Sansa Home/Travel Bundle works exactlly as advertised. What else do I need to say! Amazon fast free shipping and always the best prices. The reason I'm a loyal Amazzon shopper!BL
4,Vortex Purchase only,"When received, the car charger worked but the wall charger didn't. Vortex Cable customer service quickly sent a replacement at no charge. I highly recommend buying this to save money, but buy from Vortex Cable so you don't have to worry !! I'm so glad I did !!"
2,Not overly satisfied with this product,I am not satisfied with this product at all. I car charger works fine but the wall unit does not charge at all which is the one I was really hoping would work.
5,Excellent Product @Excellent Price,The chargers came in next to no time at all. They were packaged nicely and work beautifully-all for an amazingly low price!
4,perfect combo,Now I can charge my Sansa in a variety of ways instead of only on the computer. Works well and bought 2 because my husband needed it also.
1,"GARBAGE -- Worked once, croaked","Don't waste your money on this thing - it worked once, then failed to work again. I think the problem is the connector - it's cheap and flimsy. A perfect example of ""Make it in China for 11 cents, dump it in the States for 3 bucks."" I dumped mine in the trash.I don't want to slam the seller, though - I had two transactions with them, and both were speedy and well-handled. But you get what you pay for, and I won't be buying any more cheap chargers.My recommendation: spend $20 on a powered USB hub. I just got a nice little Belkin - it charges the Sansa (quickly, too) when the computer's off; it's small enough to use as a portable charger on a trip; and now I have extra USB ports on my desk. Money well spent."
5,Sandisk Sansa chargers,I received these items in excellent condition and they both work extremely well. I'm very happy with them. Thank you Amazon!
1,Only good for an absolute beginner,"If you know ANYTHING about eating properly already, don't purchase this book. This book is meant for beginners only. Denise must have been paid by the companies that produce the foods she suggests, because if you don't have access to the specific foods and types she recommends, there are no alternatives. The workout is also completely basic and rudimentary and focussed towards those that have NEVER worked out before, or possibly the elderly. I had high hopes for this book but was completely let down and actually returned it."
3,High maintenance,This book is a little disappointing. It has turned out to be like many other books I've read about the same things. I didn't really find anything unique the Denise is bringing to the table. Overall it is a great reference type book for fitness.
5,Losin it !,"I am on week 5 of this plan, and have lost 12 lbs. I have completely taken off the weight of both babies, and I'm within 5 lbs. of my wedding day weight. This is a great total program. The eating plan is very logical, with a good balance of nutrients. The recipes have all been good so far (except one), and relatively easy to prepare. The walking plan is nothing new since I already walk 5 days/week for 45 min., but the ""fat zone"" exercises that you can do while walking are helpful. I love her idea of ""fidgetcize,"" and try to do tummy tuck, butt squeezes and waist twists in the carpool line. I don't do all of her exercises in the book as prescribed, but I work out to videos (including a couple of hers), and I'm taking a yoga class. I am in my 40's and thought my body would not respond well to this plan, but she has my metabolism cranked! Definately a good common sense approach...and I say this as a woman and a cardiac nurse!"
1,Almost useless now,"A majority of the content are out of date now. A typical example is the chapter for Maven that is almost useless. Instead of reading this book, I'd rather go Google."
5,A must-have,"The software testing stuff was great, and the material on continuous integration is best I've read. Overall, a great reference. This book is going to stay next to my workstation."
2,Lots of potential - not much delivered,"I had high hopes for this book, but cannot recommend it. You'd be better off checking the Jakarta web sites for information and examples on the tools covered, and buying another book that actually covers XP.This book could have been great if it didn't try to be an XP book, covered the tools much more in-depth, and removed the clutter of the appendixes and repeated poor examples throughout. In addition, proper editing could really help remove the countless typos, grammatical errors, and punctuation mistakes. In this day and age I don't understand the logic in publishing hundreds of pages of code."
2,Not a Book on Extreme Programming,"The title is extremely misleading. This is not a book on extreme programming - if you purchase this book looking for insightful information on XP; you will be disapointed.This book is mainly about the open source development tools Ant, JUnit, and Cactus. The information provided is brief at best. It would have been better if the authors focused on fewer tools and gave more indepth materials.The book includes API descriptions for most of the tools discussed - this consumes about a third of the book. I am not the biggest fan of have API description in books, unless it is explicitly a reference book.In summary, if you are looking for further, quick overview, information on the OS development tools like ANT and JUnit; then this book is for you.If you are looking for meaningful information on extreme programming only; avoid this book like the plague, the information covered is cursory at best.It is a pity the title is misleading."
2,Tons of Typos,"This book is a convenient way to get a decent introduction to Java tools because all of the information is condensed into one book. However, there is nothing in here that you can't read online for free if you take the time to find it. I am really angry that I paid $40 for a book that is full of typos. There are literally typos on every other page. I have never encountered so many typos in a book before this one. The typos are especially troublesome because they often occur in the examples so if you are unfamiliar with the syntax of the new tool being taught you will get unexplainable errors when the bad examples don't work for you. Print out online tutorials, this book is a waste of money."
4,Excellent reference for open-source tools,"I bought this book mostly because I am fairly new to open-source development and was looking for a good reference to tools such as Ant, JUnit, Cactus, and Maven. These chapters were concise and had plenty of supporting examples. I also liked the fact that the book provides plenty of tips, and has references to good practices. I definitely recommend it to less experienced developers, or to those looking to have a better understanding of open-source tools."
4,very useful book,"I found this book very useful because it filled up some gaps in my programming practices. For a long time I avoided to learn Ant and other open source tools because their documentation and usage if any look so intimidating. But now with big project looming over me I decided to give it a try.The book not only helps to start with Ant, JMeter and JUnit but also shows mechanics of packaging and deployment of complex enterprise application.I substracted one star because the book does not use more accessible application server and database."
4,Good overview of important tools,"Having used JUnit and Cactus on previous development projects, I was looking forward to getting this book in order to gaining some additional insights into these and other toolsets. While there are sections that aren't as deep as I might have liked, overall the book is a good introduction to some very important tools for the Java J2EE developer. This book is a great introduction, and presents underlying concepts well."
2,intro at best,Very disappointed in this text. The examples do not scale to real world projects. Take a look at the petstore ant build structure before you adopt the approach suggested by Rich. Also - the examples are ridden with errors and hardcoded nonsense. The tools presented can be used in a manner more elegant than the author presents. Take the lessons with a grain of salt and refactor a process that works for you. (The text off the shelf won't work for most projects.) Plenty of good information available here if you are experienced and willing to sift through some mediocre examples.
5,The Easy Way to Teach Letter-Writing,"I can't wait to get the new addition. I teach 7-8th grade reading/writing handicapped middle schoolers--and FREEBIES totally solves my problems with teaching letter-writing. They can't wait to get their requests in the mail, and to receive their answers. It's one of the hits of the year--especially the large section on Sports Stuff!!"
5,Quality Superior on this 3 pc. set,This set of 3 storage bowls with plastic lids are of high quality. The bowls are of very nice construction and are very heavy duty.
4,Intense mystery with great effects,"I considered Except the Dying a dark mystery. It takes place in Toronto in 1895. The townspeople come across as cold as the Canadian winter it occurs in. Detective Murdoch is trying to solve the crime of a young maid found frozen to death and he doesn't seem to be getting much help.Maureen Jennings is a gifted writer. Her characters conversations made me feel a part of the story. The author has an ability to shock her readers at some points in her story and there was a couple of points in the first three of four chapters in which I was ready to bail. But, I stayed with it to try and solve the mystery. I would consider it a mature theme mystery.Ms. Jennings has given us an interesting series. Can't wait to see it on film."
4,A VERY GOOD READ,"This is a good mystery. The Victorian-Era setting comes to life, as well as the strict class system. However, it shows that being rich and in the correct social class doesn't mean that you are above the law, or immune to scandal. If you like historical settings, as I do, you will enjoy this book. I look foward to reading Ms Jennings' other works."
3,"Good, strong perspective with interesting facts","I thought I might have stumbled on a new favourite mystery series, but I found the storytelling a little detached. Good, strong perspective, filled with interesting facts about Toronto around the turn of the century, but not as captivating as I would have liked."
3,Except the Dying,"Somewhat bleak. The poor get poorer, etc., Justice is chancy in a world where the upper crust can pull strings to manipulate society.Right triumphs in the end, but Murdoch is very much the underdog fighting against the powers that be.Anyone who has seen the TV version of this writer will realize that Jenning's world has not been faithfully adhered to."
3,Maybe the next one will be better,"I guess for a first novel this was okay. But there were too many characters, and the motivation for the murder seemed insignificant, even considering the time period. Still, the period was brought to life quite nicely. Maybe if this had just been a historical novel, it would have worked better. I'll give the author another chance, but I wouldn't really recommend this book to other readers."
5,Siggy's / Hannaka Toy,"This Sigmund Frued Action Figure was a MUST GIFT for my Shrink's Hannaka Holiday.He is a Psychoanaylist and before I was even able to tell him that once out of the package it's value in a number of years would amount to nothing.We had a GREAT LAUGH.and that doesn't happen too often in my Sessions with him.So, lighten up...(reference to Hannaka...)HE LOVES IT!and the Cigar..."
3,Cheap but Cheap,Right out of the package 4 grommets simply fell off the tarp. But it was half the cost of the same tarp @ Home Depot. You get what you pay for. The Home Depot tarp had heavy duty slightly bigger grommets but also twice the cost. Just know what you're getting.
2,meh.,meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. meh. i traded it in for an ornette coleman cd.
4,Al Martino Fans,"I really didn't like this one, because he is alot older when he did this one, you can tell, but above this is good to listen to when you want to go to bed, easy listening. The reason that I like this CD is that he is so smooth."
3,Good but incomplete,"Pia's book provides many examples of SS uniforms and decorations, but it is by no means exhaustive. It would be a much better book if it contained more, but what it has is excellent. It has color photos which clearly show the uniforms and decorations. The only other problem with this book is inaccurate captioning in certain places."
3,"Definitely hot, but not much variety!","This is the first book of Ms. Byrd's that I've read and I'm interested to see what else she has. If you want steam, this has it in spades. They think dirty, talk dirty, and the writing is definitely explicit, but there's not much kink involved. Reading the reviews here, I thought there would be more like the bookstore scene and more variety, but mostly it's just straight, but explicit, sex. However, it was enough to make me look for more of her work."
3,Erotic ? Yes.,"But, I also wanted a story amongst all that sex. A great example is Lisa Marie Rice's Midnight Run, an equal dosing of great sex, a heartwarming story, and a book that is on my keeper shelf. I dont think I'll try any more of R. Byrd's books."
3,Hot and Steamy,"I like this book but, I thought it would be a little different. Reading other reviews made me like the book more. It's the first erotic 'romance' i have read. I didn't not like it, but i didn't fully get into it either. The character relationship wasn't what I thought it would be... If you want a quick steamy story to get the blood flowing and tempature rising, I'd read it. The bookstore scene was pretty steamy!"
3,A disturbing cliche,"I've read A Little Less Conversation by Byrd and I liked it. I'm thinking of buying this book, too. HOWEVER, the idea that the man is 3 times the height and width of his lady love is very, very creepy. I know couplings like that happen in real life, but stories where the woman is 5 feet tall and skinny and the man is 6'5"" with a chest like the side of a barn -- I mean...c'mon. It's a popular trend -- huge men dominating tiny women. I thought this genre had moved beyond that sort of thing, but it's making a strong comeback, for better or worse."
5,WOW!!!!,IM ONLY GOING TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST BOOK OF THE WHOLE SERIES.. ALL OF THE SERIES IS GREAT BUT THIS ONE CAPTURES EVERYTHING YOU LOVE ABOUT EROTICA.
1,ASHAMED,"I AM ASHAMED I BOUGHT THIS BOOK. I WAS SO SICK OF IT I DID NOT READ IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THE LITTLE I DID READ I FOUND TO BE UNREALISTIC, FILTHY AND DISGUSTING.NEVER AGAIN."
5,How hot is hot?,"When Shea Dresden goes after Ryan McCall, the explosion dwarfs Fourth of July fireworks. Shea is not what Ryan expected at all, and he's more than she ever dreamed. But it isn;t just sex with theset wo, although they'er toally combustible together. Watching them discover their feelings for each other makes this story a keeper."
3,Just too much sex,"This was the first book I read of Rhyannon Byrd and I'm not sure if I would get another of her books. If you want lots of sex, sex, and more sex then I guess this book is for you but after a while I just started flipping through the pages to get towards the end. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS ( and I like erotic fiction) BUT IT WAS TOO MUCH SEX! They were like the energizer bunny. they just kept going and going and going. It started out promising. I liked the characters, the plot was good. The author had me smiling but when the two main characters got together, the sex was non stop to me and then it just when downhill for me. After a while, I was banging my head against the wall."
3,Outdated but still good,"I suppose this is what you get when you order online. Every once in a while you don't get what you expect and I think it has a lot to do with not having the book right there in your hands before purchase. I just got this book in the mail yesterday and although I haven't got through a lot of it (50 pages or so) I can easily tell it was before Lil' Bush Jr. stepped into office and started rewriting environmental law in favor of big business favor. The book also talks (obviously) about predictions and trends in the field that may or may not still be true. I find myself reading saying ""oh thats interesting, i wonder if its still true.I know much of it has to do with me not noticing the pub. date but when you have a book with 21st century in the title I guess I kind of took it for granted."
4,Works well.. after you re-wire it.,"I had read a review about some people having to switch around a few wires. I ordered this product to attach my 2005 Honda Pilot to my new (to me) 1992 Coleman pop up camper. After the initial connection only the lights on the left side of the camper worked.. they actually worked too well since they stayed on all the time, even though they shouldn't have. The back-up light on the left side would not go out but the one on the right side would not come on. After a trip to the hardware store with a friend who actually knew what he was doing, we got the stuff to cut and splice the wires on the adapter. After playing around for a few minutes we learned that the back up light should actually be connected to the ""ground wire"". Ground wire is in "" because it actually controls the white back up lights on camper. Good product after the modifications. Good length and does the job it was made for. Quality materials and ready for some nice fall camping in Maine."
3,Ok product,"I need this adapter so that i could have brake control & lights on my RV. Adapter worked great, easy to install. Only issue is that water will collect inside where rv plug goes in, when not in use. I have to blow out the moisture every once in a while."
2,Lack of info,I have yet to install it as no directions or product information came with the item. What is the purple wire for? Great idea but lacking information.
5,Steve in Pa,A very excellent book for the advanced or the new just starting out medium . I highly recommend adding this book to your library . Well written easy to understand and follow along .
4,This actually appears to work!,I tried a Memorex DVD laser cleaner and my panasonic DVD recorder would not read it. I then tried this product and the recorder read it and it worked through it's paces. I gave this 4 stars abecause I have not played back a finished product yet.John
2,Even for beginners it&#65533;s not that good,"1.The Book gives you short information on some of the subjects related to Digital Cameras but not all2.The information is not that deep, For example the book dose not go through the digital camera menus or provide explanatory figures.3.The information related to scanning and printing are too shallow. It also has a Camera comparison list at the end of the book but you can get the information from the manufacturers Web page you do not need to pay for it.4.I would consider this book as a buyers guide for real novice beginner but not a source of information."
1,Bitter and Biased,"Here's another anti-Mormon tract by a disaffected former Mormon. To understand Leslie Reynolds better, please know that in recent political deals in Salt Lake City, UT she has condemned her opponent by publicly stating that he could not possibly understand the diverse people he would represent because of his gender, race, and religion. Poor Ms. Reynolds is so filled with bitterness that she cannot see that she is using the same arguments of bias to condemn her opponent that she claims she felt in making her ""transition.""As was said in the New Testament, if it is of God you cannot fight it and if it is not, it will fail on its own. Leave it alone, Ms. Reynolds and go find your way."
1,Freak Babylon: You may already have it,"If you already own Jack Hunter's book ""Inside Teradome"" then you won't need to buy ""Freak Babylon"". The publishers simply enlarged the print and the photos in the teratology section of ""Inside Teradome"", called it a new book and gave it a new name. Kind of deceptive, I think. But perhaps, with this review, I can save someone else from throwing their money away like I did."
4,Pastis is a genius.,This was the cutest collection of comics I've ever read. However I would have liked to see more crocs in it. Unfortunately they only appear towards the end of the book.
1,Dont bother,"This item just doesn't work. Gettting sound to work is a 50-50 chance of getting it correct getting a picture to work is a 20% chance, getting them to work together so far is 0%. Comes with very minimal instructions no online driver support waste of money."
3,Not Light Reading,"I really hoped to have a book that would convey to me how it was and how it felt to live in Ancient Greece. I guess that all of the necessary information is there, but it is not presented in any cogent way."
3,Nice small dangling earrings,"Earrings are not too long. Perfect for women with small faces. The clasp does not close properly, but, it seems to be a common problem for earrings with this type of clasp.Update: Clasp broken. Leverback is too flimsy to even last a year."
3,weren't long enough to see very much of the gemstones.,"I would have liked to see the lengths longer so you could see the earning better. My hair if only slightly lower than my ear lobe, but the earnings weren't long enough to see very much of the gemstones."
2,I returned these,In the picture these look like emeralds. In person the stones were lighter green and looked like peridots.I returned these earrings. They would be pretty if they came as pictured.
3,me,"I was very disapointed when I recieved the earrings, they were very light in color and I returned them. Aside from the color the style was what I expected, but could not be guarrented of the color, it was different from the pictures."
4,Nice!!!,Very nice earrings. Dangle well. I was excited that these earrings match an omega pair of sapphires I have; so I can wear my omegas in my upper holes and these in my lower. Would buy another pair in a different color stone.
2,Emeral 14k gold earings,"I am very disappointed. The stones are pale green and do not look like emeralds; and certainly not like the stones in the photo on Amazon.com. They look like cut glass to me. Also they are flimsy. Very light and thin gold. Maybe that is all you get for over $100 but I am just so disappointed,and will return them."
3,sapphire drop earrings,"Nice little earrings, but much more delicate than they look. Be very careful about removing and putting them in your lobes. Both lever-backs of mine are shaky after only two wears and I've had to have them strengthened at a jewellers."
4,Nice,"My wife really likes these. She has a lot of experience with jewelry and gem stones, but had no emeralds. She received these for Valentine's day, and when I told her Amazon's price, she was very pleased, especially since these are gold, not silver. They are very distinctive. She had no green to wear with them, and a trip to the store solved that problem. She does like to shop!"
2,Very small compared to the picture on the web,"This is a very small earring and you will be astonished while you see it. It is too tiny compared with the picture shown in the amazon site. I purchased this as a gift to my daughter, but none of my family members were happy with this."
4,Nice & girly earring,"I bought them for my sister but she has a square face that doesn't fit these earring at all. And they also look quite girly for a woman with kids.The stones are in light green, not as dark as on photo. However they are cute and worth for the price. The lever-backs are quite delicate but if we remove them gently, they are still fine."
4,Useful item and Easy to use.,"Great item does exactly what it is supposed to do, though you can find this item elsewhere under other brands for less expensive, if you don't mind going to the store. I bought this one since it was readily accesible on line and I ordered other items along with it. I do like the size of the can. After using it to clean out four computers, I still have plenty of air left to store the can away for next time."
3,Lots of precautions before using,"I've never read the precaution label on the more 'famous' brand of this product (which is most often used by photographers, etc.), but this brand has quite a few precuations. And, after just a few quick tests, and one relatively fast cleaning of a small object, the can felt like it was down to half-full. Again, maybe the other brands are just the same...and this one is 'no different'."
3,Was a Little Surprised by Size,"Could swear the ones I used to use in my office were a little bigger, but got the job done. Removes all the buildup from your keyboard, but have to be carefull not to tip or liquid will come out."
1,Very Disappointed,"Received the item in a big box. However, when I opened the box, the trigger was broken apart into few pieces, as someone intentionally stepped on it. Now I have useless metal can. This product can not be returned, so I can't do anything. Very disappointed by Amazon this time."
2,No straw false advertisement,They didn't give me the stupid little straw for the can to be effective. Don't know if this is typical or not but it's false advertisement as the picture clearly has a straw on it. I want a refund or give me the straw.
3,limited in use because needs to be upright. also not strong air flow,"i would not buy this again. I found its use very limited because it needs to be upright in order to work. unfortunately that means it can't be used to clean a lot of fiddly things or things that can't be held up exactly vertically to allow for cleaning. Also, the air flow was not very strong, so it didn't do much to clean."
3,Use with care,"I got this stuff because I knew my laptop's innards were dusty but I couldn't open the case without voiding the warranty. I did was every single website says to do and shot the air into the vents. Just like that, my fan stopped working. I don't know if the air caused it to over spin or what but the lesson here is to use this stuff with care. Effective but risky."
1,I should have believed the reviews.,Do not let the pretty can fool you. According to the instructions a person has to hold this can in a perfect upright position for it to spray properly. Not everything can be maneuvered into that perfect position to be cleaned with this canned air.
1,This is NOT air,It says air and propellant but it's not it is a GAS. I was looking for cheap compressed air and end up buying GAS unknowingly.
5,"good compressed air can, but dont tilt",this is a good amount of compressed air in this can. Its best to use in short bursts and to not tilt it since its compressed liquid it will shoot out when tilted on the side.
4,No straw?,"This works well for cleaning out the innards of my PC, and I'm satisfied with how much compressed air there seems to be. However, I should note that I didn't receive the straw shown in the picture -- this may or may not be typical."
2,Too bulky,"I was really disappointed with this product. I Think is a great idea but the product is not well done. It is extremely big, feels like going around with a dipper on. The mini pad was a better fit for me; however, the design I got (Japone) started to peal off when I washed it."
2,nice idea poorly executed,"They are too big to not move all over the place. Very bulky ""pad"" inserts are really a 9x6 piece of cloth like a baby bib?? that you have to fold in half 2x and put in these holder things on top and bottom. Very bulky. I'm 5.8 and large boned too, I can't imagine a petite person using these. They feel like diapers. I'm going to try another brand that has a contoured shape that would actually snap securely to the crotch of panties. There is so much room where they attach the whole thing could spin around. It's not any more secure than putting a wash cloth in your underpants. Boo. And expensive too."
5,"This is a ""Must Read"".","I was diagnosed with breast cancer several months ago. My husband and I have been together for 28 years and we have been best of friends. He has been extremely supportive through out this ordeal. However, I came to a point where I was having difficulty explaining what I was needing. A friend suggested this book. I read it and asked my husband to read it too. Now I would like to suggest this book to every breast cancer survivor and their husbands/partners. Be well. Be stong."
4,I Wish I Did Not Have a Reason to Read This Book.....,"Marc Silva certainly wishes he didn't have a reason to write this book. Fortunately for the rest of us, he did write it, and it's a wealth of down-to-earth, sometimes humorous and well-organized information on what a husband can do to help his wife (and himself) while she is going through breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. It's a frank discussion of fear, denial, pain, emotional and sexual needs.I bought this book for our son, whose wife was diagnosed with invasive lobular breast cancer. At age 45 and 47, both are in the prime of their very active lives. Their two sons, 13 and 16 are looking to their dad as a role model. How he copes with this devastating disease is important, not only for his wife, but for their children.Thank you Marc Silva for giving the men in our lives some ground rules and lots of enlightenment."
5,Breast Cancer Husband: How to Help Your Wife and Yourself,What a great idea this book is! Often people don't think of what the husband is going through. This book addresses all of these issues and is very good. I would recommend this book!
5,FABULOUS FIND!!!,"I am a stage 4 cancer survivor and I LOVE this book! I, like so many others, wish I had found this book earlier. Not only is it a must have for the man who wants to support his wife in the best way possible but it has alsobeen a great help in teaching me how to ask for the help that I need in a way my husband can understand."
3,have you ever seen a real doggie bowl?,"Confession: I bought this charm for my dog's collar. It serves its function as bling, but you would have to stare at it a long time to recognize it as a dog bowl. Because it is oblong. As oblong as a 'good and plenty' candy. It is the perfect size (tiny) and, basically, I like it, but I just wish it were a more realistic shape (ROUND)."
5,I'M A BOOGIE WOOGIE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK!I got this tape in the bargin bin - but it sure rocks! Don't look for a ground breaking album here - just great ""Garage Rock"". All the songs sound at home in a garage with a bunch of blue collar guys working on old cars and drinking rec bev's.I like it."
2,Wheres the beef?,I'm a former Marine and found this looking for war books. I don't get it--is it supposed to be about the author's father? Lots of statistical type information that bogs you down. Doesn't really work as a biography or a technical book. I didn't think the book contributed anything new or particularly exciting to the study of World War Two or to the history of the Marines.
4,Very nice product,"The leather note jotter is almost as nice as others I have purchased from Levenger at more than twice the price. The only thing I didn't like about it was the ""to do"" cards that came with it. They looked cheap and un-elegant. I threw them out and replaced them with nicer 3x5 cards."
3,2 -1/2 QT Franciscan Desert Rose Whistling Tea Kettle Review,"I recently purchased this tea kettle. I thought the kettle part itself is lovely, but the cheesy plastic rose on the lid for the pot through me a bit when I lifted it out of the box, as it is a bright fluorescent hot pink. It does not match the desert rose pattern at all. I have had to paint the rose to tone down the intensity of the color. It looks fine now and I intend to use it, just hope the new paint job holds out!"
5,Desert Rose Whistling Tea Kettle,"Works great! Heats up fast - even on my old cooktop.... The whistle is extremely funny sounding. Makes me smile every time it goes off. I thought the color of the rose on the lid was just fine. Not too bright, as previously stated. Just my own opinion, of course! This is not a large kettle. I'd call it medium-sized. It fits perfectly on the smaller burner."
2,There is better for FREE!,"I bought this book and thought it would tell me quite a bit and in fact it does but..............just goto IGN and become a member, they provide a guide book which is just as good for FREE although it does not have the Alisa story line, there are only subtle differences anyway..............Don't waste your cash when you don't have to."
1,Couldn't finish it,"This book was boring, trite and predictable - not at all the caliber of writing of mary Jo Putney's earlier books."
5,Pure Magic,"I've been a Mary Jo Putney fan for years, and this spritely book reminded me why.I've always loved historicals, but after twenty years reading about dukes, marriage-minded-mamas, and the Ton, I'd gotten a little bored.Putney neatly blows all the dust off with her magical version of the eighteenth century. That it's beautifully written goes without saying; Putney's prose has always been gorgeous. Then we have delicious Jack Langdon, who strikes sparks with his lovely, intelligent healer Abby. The rest of the cast is just as engaging, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I plan to get the other books in this series as soon as I finish posting this.It's been a long time since I've been this charmed by a romance novel. Brava, Ms. Putney!Angela Knight"
3,Get what you pay for,"Much like the Opteka fish-eye lens I bought at the same time, I didn't expect much of a quality lens for this low price. And got exactly what I paid for.A low priced, low quality lens that does a specific job.I only needed something super telescopic for those few times I might see a hawk or eagle at a distance. Just to capture the moment, note to record for all prosperity.The closest object I could focus on was about 100 feet away. Anything closer will not focus, which is OK of course.The lens is extremely slow, so you'll want to pop your ISO way up, even on bright days.The lens is heavy, and needs a tripod. I've shot without, but it is like having another leg sticking out of your face.There is no autofocus.But, good for specific purpose."
2,kinda worth the money,"I think some of the glowing reviews are from people that sell these, they are ok at best, you might get cool shots of wildlife because it brings you close, it definately will not be high quality, cheap is cheap, please don't get one of these thinking you'll work for national geographic if you do."
2,"Powerful zoom, low quality images","This is a powerful zoom, but the quality of the results make it unsuitable for Nature or Sports photography. I have managed to get some passable shots of the moon, but the results are unusable professionally."
3,Fair enough for the price ...,"I had bought this lens 3 months back, i agree that the quality is low but you cannot expect more for this price, any way you can apply some photoshop enhancement at your photo to reduce the noise and chromatic aberration at the edges.Using tripod is essential of course since it is very heavy and there is no Image stabilizer.Also you can buy the opteka 2x teleconvertor to double your focal length to 2600mm ,but the quality will be MORE bad, actually i'm using this lens for the moon only until now..."
4,opteka 650-1300mm,"Nice toy for hobbiist or amateur photographer. Only the plastic ring never lock the zoom setting.Picture is little darker,but ISO 400 and higher could fix that."
1,A not well- written book.,The story is very confusing because it doesn't get to the point of the story. There are also unimportant and unnecessary things that readers wouldn't want to know.
3,Interesting but not a quick read,"The novel caught my interest in the beginning with the story of a young teen pretending to steel. The author's use of such explicit detail slowed down the pace of the story line and made it hard for the reader to stick to the book. Granted the tale itself is intreaging, but the way it is writen made the book a chore to enjoy."
3,SERIOUS GAME,"Anna, the main character of the novel is a chronic pretend shoplifter. This behavior escalates to a more serious problem of her actually shoplifting. Anna is a child of divorced parents who Cadnum points out, do not relaize the serious extent of Anna's problem. Once again, Michael Cadnum brilliantly accentuates the conflict between the adolescent and themselves, and the adolescent's relationship with the adults in the novel. The story is very detailed and realistic, an excellent choice for the reader."
3,Tries but doesn't quite succeed,"Kyra Sedgwick turns in a fine performance as a woman obsessed with having a perfect child. But somehow, the film just plods along without becoming as disturbing as it should have been."
4,good movie,I bought this movie not thinking that it would be that great..Well when I saw it I was very happy that I bought this movie...Its a story that can be so true and so sad but there are some mothers like the person in the move...I would say if you are looking for a movie that is a little twisted that is base on real life then this is a movie to see.
1,If only we could give less than one star,"How could Kevin Bacon or the screenwriter give any dignity to this character? She was horribly abusive in how she imprisoned her son - not to mention that she damn near succeded in her attempts to kill him. What she did to that little bird has haunted me for weeks - and not in the way great art does. Bacon leaves the question open: Did she brutally murder the bird because he took her son's affections away from her? Or, was it a mercy killing? Nice try. When you're flush with cash like she was, there are vets around to check broken-winged birds out. Even if you don't have a dime, there's the ASPCA. Her son honors her at the end, like she was some model maverick. If only someone had done her in - but slowly, like the tortures she'd inflicted on the defenseless - instead of her deciding on her own that her job was done here. I have a high threshold for pain and intensity in movies, but not when the filmmaker is asking us to revere the lowest scum."
1,Garbage Masquerading As Art,"Is there anythingamusing, lighthearted or redeemingabout extreme psychological illness,sexual depravity, child abuse, suicideand attempted murder?This movie would have you think so.There is no reason to view this filmand numerous reasons not to.Do not be seduced by its pedigree.It's technical merit is wasted."
2,Could of been great,"The first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner. After that things went amiss. You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o's I found. It got to the point where I just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration. I could go on but then I would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair."
2,Can't understand the rave reviews,"I just can't understand why the reviewers here like this book so much. Character development is weak at best. The pacing is disjointed and jerky. The dialog is stilted. I can't remember who talked about ""disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead"", but it seems appropriate here. Supernatural, quasi-natural and pseudo-scientific explanations are jumbled together without any thought or consistency. The villains are cardboard, but that's alright because everyone else is.It's just a bad book overall. And it's not even frightening.Customers should save their money and avoid this book"
5,Solid help for stressed moms,"This is an excellent and practical resource for conscientious mothers who may be feeling pressured to perfection. In today's harried world, the women trying hardest to be a good mothers often end up overworked and overstressed. For moms who need to refocus their priorities to achieve balance, this book is invaluable.~Susan MaltbyL.A. Parent Woman Wise columnist"
2,Guilt By Association,"I think anyone reading this book will feel that they have been made to feel guilty. To me, more than trying to help with these feelings, the book does more to bring them to your attention and you begin to think - OMG - what am I doing with my kids and I should feel guilty about it !The book is an easy read and does not do much to answer any questions in my opinion. It may make you feel better however, because it says its ok to feel guilty. In the end - the book did little for me."
4,nice,"this is sort of a ""how to"", you know the kind that tells you what you already know, and makes you think you can actually implement the ideas. when it comes down to it, if you just want validation for what you're feeling, and want to know why you're feeling that way, this probably isn't the solution. this explains what you can do to change your situation"
1,Left Wing Propaganda,This book has been proven to be inaccurate. The primary American witness has been proven as a fraud and was not even in Korea. For the real story - see the book about No Gun Ri written by Bateman also available through Amazon.
1,Publishers Weekly's comment pretty well nails it,"From Publishers Weekly:"" ... This volume ... is correspondingly best understood as advocacy reportage, eschewing critical analysis ...""The apparent inability on the authors' part to do any serious fact checking is almost jaw-dropping."
5,Outstanding book,"An outstanding book. I myself knew absolutely nothing about electricity when I first bought this book - although obviously it didn't make me an expert, it nonetheless taught me what I needed to know to start modifying my boat's electrical systems. I admit that I am biased - Don Casey is one of my favorite sailing authors - but if you are a novice and need to upgrade your boat's electrics, this is the book to get."
5,Makes Boat Electronics Easily Understandable,"Don Casey is a cruising writer most cruisers are familiar with. His excellent SailNet articles are a must reads. I've read them all, you should too. Mr. Casey really does simplify boat electronics in this easy to understand book that is good for both novice and old salt alike."
4,Casey's Sailboat Electrics Simplified,"Don's approach provides the novice with a very good understanding of concepts, layout and design, installation practices, trouble shooting, etc. A great first place to go for the aspiring DIY'er!"
5,Chemicals do good to!,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in knowing a little more about chemicals and their place in the world. Through his stories, Schwarcz explains how chemicals are used in our everyday lives and how very often they are given a ""negative impact"" as not being natural. He shows how media and others have made chemicals appear to always be bad yet at the same time these agencies neglect the overwhelming good of chemistry! This book is not about bashing media but rather to inform the reader of the global story and the truth about many of the so-called ""toxins"" in our world. It is a truly interesting book that is light hearted in its style so that it will please both the scientist as well as the non-scientist!Finally, if you ever get to see ""The Magic of Chemistry"" or take ""The World of Chemistry"" course at McGill ... they are also highly recommended!"
3,Nice to know,"This book contains more than five dozen articles each describing some chemical substance, how it was discovered and how it became useful. All interesting and many clearly explained. Each piece of knowledge, however, is encased long texts straining to be funny. Any trick, preferably cute, is acceptable if it seems it will make the reader smile. Thus, chapters with titles such as ""Oil You Need to Know"" or ""Willow Power"", little anecdotes, references to famous names, closely or not associated with subject at hand. So much extraneous material weighs heavily on the final text. If the reader is patient and has little else to do, this may the book, if he is also interested in chemistry."
1,Fox Run French Fry express potato cutter,"I used this product 4 times,and one of the blades broke when cutting a medium potato,not good at all,would not advise to purchase this product."
1,Not Good,I ran a medium sized potato through the cutter. Only part of the potato came out as fries because one of the blades had broken completely from the frame. This was the first time to use the product.
1,Doesn't work/not worth the money!,"I purchased this as a gift and we were excited to start using it right away, however our potatos were a little old and starting to go soft, but we thought why not. Even with softer potatoes this was horrible to use. Took so much effort to push the potato through and the end was never completely cut.Not being ones to give up we cleaned it up (not easy to do by the way) and put it aside until we had new potatos to see if that made a difference. It did not.Trying to line everything up, pushing, etc was difficult. We then tried the smaller blade for smaller fries thinking perhaps it was the blades, but that was even worse.Just a horrible waste of money, ended up returning it.Would not recommend."
1,worst junk ever,"Worst piece of Chinese junk I ever purchased.Only fits half of a potatoe and can't even stand up to that.I used it three times and the handle broke, a blade bent and came out and the blade frame cracked. Save your money and leave this one in China."
1,crappy crap crap,Same as everyone else said.. i bought this today.. tried to use it once.. got a 1/4 of a potato cut (With MUCH effort).. the 2nd quarter would not cut and then the handle broke off.. Hopefully can return the junk!
4,Husband really liked it,"and more importantly now puts his stuff away as compared to throwing it on his dresser. This ""manbox"" is pretty sharp and does not look too feminine which is good when you are buying a jewelry box for a man. This was one of my christmas gifts to him and I was a bit worried about whether or not he would like it and I was pleasantly surprised when he did. It also really holds a lot of stuff - he has about 12 pairs of cufflinks in there and 5 watches and there is still room.I priced these around in person and I seen some really expensive watch valets in stores and this is on par with most of the ones they had for about 100 bucks; they had ones for 200 bucks which blew this out of the water but they were 200 bucks and I wasn't looking to spend that much. This is a steal from what I have seen in shopping for these both online and in person."
5,Great Product,This is a great jewelry box. I keep all my good jewelry in it tucked out of sight. Lots of compartments for organizing. Nicely made with a feeling of luxury.
5,Great gift for men,"I had ordered this as a gift for my brother-in-law, who has a fair amount of watches and cuff links. He's definitely someone who has finer/expensive tastes, and I knew I'd have to get something that would live up to those expectations. The Tech Swiss Valet doesn't disappoint. The box itself is very well constructed and sturdy, with a soft leather casing. The fabric on the inside of the case is both aesthetically and functionally a great choice; the box looks great, and it protects all items inside. There's also plenty of room to store several watches and other items. It is definitely something that would not look out of place in a guy's room. I think the product is an even better buy considering the price.5/5, highly recommend."
5,GREAT GIFT!,This was a gift for my husband. He LOVES it. Great quality inside and out. It also comes with a bust bag. Great product for the price!
4,Valet for watches,For the price I thought it would have been bigger. It's a nice valet. It has a key which is nice.
4,Big Watch Beware,"Helps organize my dresser and has a nice clean look, but my larger watches (INVICTA especially) dont fit. I had to take my russian diver out to close the top. Other than that, good buy."
4,John Marshall,This is a Great addition to any personal Library. If You are an Amuteur Historian you will thoroughly enjoy this set.
3,Not for long-term home,"Nothing against the product, except this: if you're looking to house a pet rabbit, regardless of size, don't consider a small cage or crate. Rabbits can be housed in an open pen inside your home when neutered and they have even more roaming space if you let them share a room with you. See house rabbit societies online for more information."
1,Break too easy,"This product would be great if they lasted longer. I wore a brand new pair today and they are already coming apart. If the snow is not too deep and you walk on anything else, (pavement, small rocks, etc.) they just won't last. Great concept and traction, but they are going to have to last a longer then they do for me to give them a good rating."
2,Walker Foot Traction,These worked great in the snow and ice but they broke the third time I used them. I wouldn't buy this product.
3,Yaktrax are pretty good,"I bought these to prevent slipping while walking to school on icy roads and sidewalks. They do a good job of it, but unfortunately, even with proper sizing they can fall off somewhat unexpectedly. One night I was walking home and one unknowingly fell off - so I had to backtrack after getting home and finding it missing. Thew work pretty well on ice, but check as you walk to make sure you don't lose them anywhere. That's really my main problem with them. They go on and seem tight, but if they get stuck on something (like a twig) while walking they can pop right off and you might not notice - especially when walking in the dark."
2,Not for everyday use!,"I bought a pair of Yaktrax Walkers last winter for walking on snow and ice-covered backroads here in Vermont. They initially worked really well even though one would occasionally fall off my foot. They really do improve traction, even on glare ice -But they won't make you invincible and you can still slip if you're not careful!Unfortunately, they only lasted me about three weeks before they started to self-destruct. The rubber bands that hold the steel traction coils get pinched between the coils and the ground and eventually break leaving the Yaktraks unusable. If you don't walk very much these may be right for you. But if you do, you'll go through several pairs of these a season because they wear out fairly quickly. I ended up getting Stabilicers. Those have lasted much longer although they're less comfortable to wear and more expensive."
4,Worth the purchase,"These kept me from falling on the icy sidewalks many a day. The only thing I would recommend is to not wear them with oddly shaped sneakers (Sketchers and some of the new basketball shoes) because they will stretch out of shape. Otherwise, I highly recommend them."
5,Yaktrax do the job,"Yaktrax make walking on ice, snow, slush absolutely safe. They are great, and size medium fits a range of shoes and boots."
3,Not easy to put on,I haven't needed to wear them yet. They seem like they'd work great. They were recommended by our chiropractor. Not sure there will be anymore ice in my area any more this year. I did attempt to put them over my shoes myself. Call me a weakling. I'll have to have my husband put them on for me before he goes to work...if I had to rely on my strength to attach them I'd be walking on the ice without them. That wouldn't be a good thing.
5,Yaktrax,"They are the best invention ever. I haven't fallen at all in the ice or snow w/ the Yaktrax on. You need to make sure you take them off or walk carefully when you are in a mall or in your home because they are dangerously slick on ceramic tile. Too bad I haven't heard of these earlier this winter when I have taken some really bad falls on the ice. I heard about Yaktrax from a reporter on channel 8, she had them on to keep from falling while doing a report."
5,Walking on ice.,The Yaktrax Walker Traction Clease for Snow and Ice have been a great help during this long snowy and icy winter.
5,Just what I was looking for.,They work great and I am going to buy more to use for when friends and family come to visit.
4,Essential for winter running,"These are essential for winter running on ice. The only problem is that if you end up running on too much snow, it will bunch up beneath your feet and make them pretty useless. They definitely give you traction on ice though, so they are great for preventing injury."
5,AMAZING!,This is so easy and flexible to use. It really works. I walk to work everyday and I'm glad I purchased these. No more slipping and sliding.
3,They worked very well for a day.....until they fell apart,"The good news is that they worked very well. While others were sliding around like Bambi on ice, I was completely sure-footed.Problem was that after a day, they fell apart. The cleats wore thru the rubber. Now I may just have had a dud pair, maybe my boots stretched them too far (although I was wearing the right size). To be fair, someone else had them and they lasted fine.Maybe think about the Pro option for use with boots."
1,Not built to last.,"Purchased these after a different pair of ice cleats died on me in a very short period of time. I assumed that these would last at least through the winter, boy was I mistaken. I calculate I trekked maybe 12 miles in these before the rubber degraded enough to make the entire item fall to pieces. First day I wore them a coil came off, so with a fair amount of time and a pair of pliers I fixed them temporarily. I would not recommend this product to anyone. At all. The rubber they're crafted with stiffens when cold and causes misalignment and constant correction. Then they fall apart shortly thereafter."
3,Yaktrax Walker Cleats,I have not had snow or ice lately to try these but the folks I work with say they areAMAZING.
1,"Flimsy, Delicate",I wore them out once and they were completely destroyed. Good idea but comes up short where it counts.
4,Great on ice and packed snow,"I have owned a couple pairs of these and that, in itself, is somewhat of a review. More on that in an minute. The good: they grip the ice amazingly well, I feel very secure walking on ice or packed snow with these on. They are easy to put on, if you can sit down. A little more difficult if you have to stand to do it, unless your balance is excellent. The are snug on my shoes and fit well. Ok, now the bad: They break. The rubber breaks where they stretch around the curve of your shoe. Now, they usually are still usable, after one break, but two and you have to toss them. And it's not a size thing, I have the biggest size for my size 12 shoes. That being said, the price on Amazon for the plain black ones is hard to beat and if you don't wear them a lot, they will last several years. I only wear them maybe once a week in winter, so they have lasted me about 2 years."
4,You get what you pay for,The product is as advertised but is lacking some durability. After a week of use in snow and ice the rubber that holds the coil in place snapped. But overall is a good product for what you pay for.
4,Works well in adverse conditions,I had a set previously and just replaced with a pair exactly the same as I knew they worked well and had confidence using them in adverse conditions and are easy enough to carry with you.
2,Expensive and short-lived,"I used my Yaktrax over two winters: shoveling snow twice, going for three or four long walks, and a few 3-mile jogs. They are now incredibly rusted and expect them to break soon. For $20 the metal (and rubber) could be good enough quality not to rust and last a very long time. Just another example of ingenuity destroyed by cheap manufacturing."
3,A. Willard's review is spot-on,"These are great----but are short-lived. (About eight weeks with this YakTrax Walker for a two-block walk once or twice a day for me.)I'm going to pay a little more and get the stouter ones, just as I've seen other reviewers suggest."
2,for small jobs.......,"broke within two weeks. this product would work fine for an occasional walk to the garage from the house on street shoes. in all fairness, i wore them over boots, on ice."
5,Pleased,This is a relatively good product and I would recommend it to people that are looking to add a safety feature to your shoes during the winter months. This won't prevent every slip or fall but the grips do help a great deal.
2,Mailman Stress-Test: FAILED,"Purchased a set in winter 2008-09 to take out on my walking mail routes in Salt Lake City. While the traction improvement was noticeable, the spiral rings decoupled from the rubber supports after about 1.5 miles. Many of my postal customers did thoroughly scrape their walkways, so some of that distance was on bare concrete. I suspect this accelerated the degradation of my Yaktrax. In any case, that's still a very short distance so I can't recommend them for anything but light duty and/or occasional use."
2,Yaktrax Walker Traction Cleats for Snow and Ice,"I'm a mailman. I used The Yaxtrax Walker Traction cleats as soon as I got them. I thought they were great. I was able to keep good footing as I delivered my entire route. However, they were only good for a one time use. On the second day of wearing them, the coils started popping off like old rubber bands. now I use another type that comes with a replacement spike. these are more durable than the coils.Yaktrax Walker Traction Cleats for Snow and Ice -don't buy!!!"
2,Fragile,"Having had two pairs myself and having gifted another four pairs, I can say that Yaktrax Walkers are a good idea but one poorly executed. Spiral wires are held in place by a frame of elasticized plastic. The plastic is quite fragile and the problem occurs because the wires aren't long enough to cover the entire expanse of the shoe's sole (which would prevent chafing of the plastic with the roadway). Too soon the plastic chafes and breaks - never a full winter of use, in my experience. Before they chafe through, they are excellent. I would recommend that anyone ignoring my review, pay the extra that the Pro model costs because sooner or later you will almost certainly walk out of the standard (strapless) model and lose it before you know that it's gone."
3,"not good for ice, and they're flimsy","This product is okay on packed snow, but it tends to fall off your foot, especially in unpacked snow. I wasted a lot of time hunting for them again and again, so I got a size smaller to see if that would solve the problem, but then they broke after just a few uses from being stretched too much. In addition, the coils do not grip well on smooth ice and makes walking on hard floors a real slip-and-fall hazard if you forget to take them off when entering a home or business. I switched to Get-A-Grip ice cleats and have found them to be much safer on both packed snow and ice."
1,YakTraxs no. Kahtoola Microspikes yes.,"I went through two YakTraxs this year. Wore one pair in three storms last year. The other was brand new. Both tore apart while shoveling ice off my driveway this year. YakTraks are good for casual walking or for an emergency, like leaving in your car. The bottom springs on YakTraxs cut the ""delicate"" rubber assembly apart otherwise. I started searching for another option and stumbled upon Kahtoola Microspikes. They are fantastic. It's a slip on like the YakTraxs, but the system and assembly is rigorous, well constructed and solid. They look and act like snow chains for your boots. YakTraxs don't stay in place on your boots either. I'm very, very satisfied with the Kahtoola Microspikes and will never buy YakTraxs again.YakTraxs are inexpensive throw away light walking wires. Not for icy hills or rigorous snow sports / work.Cheap and the rubber breaks, is cut by the spike easily.Find a better option. They are out there."
5,No-slip,"Folks that walk on hardpack snow and ice in driveways and on sidewalks need these. Just enough bite to stop slipping. Not obtrusive or clunky when walking, even on clear surfaces. ONLY slipperinesss with them ON occurs if you leave them on and walk on ceramic tile INdoors. (Duh.)"
2,Doesn't withstand heavy use,"In the last two winters I've gone through two pairs of Yaktrax the second pair is totally ruined, and that's just wearing them around our very hilly yard doing outside chores. I keep them on my work boots all winter long. They fall off my boots all the time, and I've had to bungie cord them to my boots to keep them from falling off. Right off the bat the coils start to crack and break and the sharp edges cut the rubber, and the whole things starts to fall apart. I've now ordered myself some Stabilicers and hopefully they will last longer. I don't recommend Yaktrax at all for constant wear. I imagine they are fine for very light use, or emergency use."
2,seemed like a good idea,"Tried them out today for the 1st time. Was a little difficult to get them on my boots but not bad considering I have not used them before. Walked over some snow to get to the sidewalk and 1 came off. OK, I figured I just didnt get them securely on. Put it back on and walked again through the snow and it came off again. Put it in my pocket and decided to walk with the 1 to see how it worked. Crossed the street and walked through a small amount of snow again and the other one came off too. Not only would they not stay on my feet, they are clear and very difficult to see in the snow. My guess is that they probably work really well on ice but there cannot be any snow. If you choose to buy them try and find something other than clear so if they do come off you can find to return, which is what I am going to do"
5,Yaktrax Walker Cleats,Yaktrax walkers are great If every person that has to walk on icy conditions put these on there shoes or boots they would not ever have to worry about falling again.I think they are the best. I have all of my friends using them too and they love them .So if you think ice think yaktrax they are made for each other.
5,A lifesaver,"I walk a lot -- try to do at least 5 miles every day. When its snowy it can be a challenge. When its icy, really troublesome. So easy to slip and fall. Its bad on visible sheets of ice and worse on those invisible slicks. I really hated trying to walk under those conditions.Now, I slip on the Yaktrax and am good to go. They grab the ice and make walking safe. It also makes it easier to get through snow. Another advantage. No matter how waterproof the boots, they still get wet. The extra lift from the Yaktrax keeps them drier."
5,Yaktrax Walker,I bought this for my wife and she loved this product making every step safe during this winter season in this Midwest area. Very well recommended.
1,These will break will little use,"I had only had these for one season and when I used them for the first time in the following winter, one of the rubber straps broke in the middle of an 7 mile backcountry hike. When I repeatedly asked customer service if they would replace the one that broke, they said no exceptions. No wonder they only offer a 90 day warranty. I am going to try Kakos instead."
3,Satisfactory,These crampons are good for the price together with poles they really help with snow hiking. I havent used them enough to give more comments
1,Yaktrax Walker Durability,"I was very excited when I first tried on the Yaktrax walkers. I have a very steep driveway. Clearing off snow can get very challenging with slippery winter weather. The Yaktrax walkers worked great the first time. The second time I used them, they also fell off a couple times. The third time I used them the ""sturdy outerband"" broke. Not sure how they can call it ""sturdy"" If you plan on using these for anything substantial, I would recommend looking at a different product."
2,Lost item second day,Bought this product to walk my dog in the woods and it did not stay on my shoe the second time I wore it.
1,Waste Of Money,I just wasted $22 on a product that didn't even last one snowfall. Don't buy! the springs will cut through the rubber frame and I weigh only 135lbs.
1,Yaktrac not so great,I have only had the Yaktracs for a short time & it consistently slips off my boots & I have slipped & fell once when wearing them.Lian Morton
1,Really expensive for how long they last!,"I've just broken my 2nd pair of YakTrax Walkers this year and am shocked at how easily the rubber tears. Think about it... uneven steel coils wrapped around thin rubber strands. I wore them when shoveling a hilly driveway; the sideways force caused the unevenly spaced coils to partially unwind on the rubber strands. Whenever a tight section of coil reaches a rubber junction (of which there are several under your feet) it cuts or tears the rubber. One rip and it's all over, no fixing these puppies. I got ONE use out of the last pair. Ridiculous.A much better product is the ICE TREKKER DIAMOND GRIP- ICE CLEATS. No rubber under your feet, diamond shaped cleats to bite into ice, much more durable. Worth every penny, available through Amazon and others.Learn from my mistake, shop carefully."
3,Not for mixed terrain,"Wore these on an 8 mile hike with 3000k elevation on mixed rock/dirt/snow/ice terrain. The yaktracks went on easily and worked reasonably well, but broke near the end of the trip. Both yaktracks had severed rubber pieces. I think these are for either pure ice/snow terrain or lighter around-town wear. Also, I wasn't as stable on slopes with ice as my friend who was wearing Stabilicers. That's what I'm going for next."
3,Yak Trax,"I've had two major problems with my pair of Yak Trax. The first time I wore them for a 3 mile hike in ice and snow, the apparatus rolled up constantly off my right foot. Worse, the second time I tried them, the elastic broke.They do hold well in ice and snow, but are far more fragile than I had hoped for. My wife has enjoyed hers, however."
4,"Good for around town, shoveling driveway - NOT trails","I got these as a gift and took them with me to a river hunting. There was a lot of ice everywhere: driveway, road, riverbank, ect. and I wanted good traction with my Muck Boots. They fit great, gave me perfect traction when loading the car parked on glare ice and helped me stand up on slanted slabs of ice along the river. They worked great until I hit deep snow and punched through old ice. While pulling my boot out of one of the holes in the ice on the riverbank, one of them caught on the ice and shot off - I never found it. Up until then it worked great.I used them for less than an hour so I can't comment on durability. I would probably recommend something more heavy-duty anyway as those rubber bands don't seem like they are up to heavy trail use - strictly an urban accessory."
2,"Work,but came apart.","We were very pleased and happy in the beginning, walking was easier here in the Michigan U.P. until one of the coils worked loose, caught on my husbands other ""ice grip"" and tripped him, tearing that one also. We only had them a few weeks, wish they lasted longer as they did make give me more confidence walking. But after he fell flat on his face, I'm a little uneasy wearing them."
1,Look for something else,"I can't understand how so many reviewers gave this product five stars. For a winter hiking trip, I purchased three sets for my family. All three failed. On the first day, the first hike, two pair broke. The wire at the bottom cut through the rubber. Prior to the breakage, my daughter's Yaktrax kept coming off her foot. To finish our trip, we rigged the broken Yaktrax to make them useable. On the second day, the third pair broke. This is a 100% failure rate - completely unacceptable. One hiker in our group had the Yaktrax Pro. That pair did not break and not did come off her boot, but I will not give Yaktrax another try."
1,Didn't make it through one full day of use.,"I bought a pair of these for my wife who owns and operates a dog walking business. After one day of use on ice packed roads, the metal spring on one side of the product came off, and the plastic is worn through so much in one area that it's about to break altogether.These are for *very* light use...."
1,YakTrax Walker,The merchant involved was great. The product is not very robust. They have been worn approximately twelve times (asphalt roadway with ice and snow) and the rubber connecting straps are worn through already. Very disappointed.
1,Horrible,These kept falling off when I was hiking and I would have to go back looking for one. They also broke after 2 seasons use. They need a strap to hold them on and could use to be more durable. Not for the serious hiker. For the occasional snowstorm in your driveway maybe.
2,Not durable,These grippers work well but unfortunately the rubber cords around which the wire coils are wrapped are not durable. After wearing these about a dozen times the rubber cord broke making the grippers useless. Too bad because they fit well and worked well while they lasted.
4,works really well of most surfaces,"First of all, make sure you order the exact right size. My shoe size was right on the line so I ordered up to large when I wish I had ordered down to medium....stretches easily.With that said, I found that they worked extremely well on almost all surfaces. However, when I went walking through the woods and came upon frozen snow/ice patches, that they yak's did not hold traction as well as on other surfaces."
5,Yaktrax Walker Traction Cleats,"The cleats are just what they are advertised to be. They are easy to put on and take off. Most importantly, they work. It's easy to walk on icy parking lots, out on the lake ice fishing, shoveling a slippery deck. They are not clumsy or awkward. Anyone that has to deal with icy conditions should have a couple of pairs of these. Even if you only need them once the whole winter season. They can easily help prevent a fall and broken bones."
5,great!,Works great for walking down my steep driveway which is a sheet of ice right now. I bought these for myself and then bought more for my kids.
2,Just commenting on size for now,"I purchased an X-small for my son who wears a size 4.0m in little kids (grade school). I had to give it a little tug to stretch it under his sneaker so I wouldn't suggest an X-small for a size 4.5 or larger. I want him to wear them to and from school so he doesn't slip but will have to remind him to take them off once inside. The metal coils under the shoe would prevent him from wearing them throughout the day. They protrude out a bit and it will tear up the floor I'm sure.***Update***Will not buy again nor recommend. They worked great as my son was able to walk on ice ""normally"". Great idea, poor design. They came off of my son's shoes at some point and they are lost."
3,"OK for limited use, but coils wear out quickly and catch on carpet, etc.","Have used several pair of Yaktraxs on Sorels in ski areas. They work well on ice and frozen ground as intended. However the wound coils quickly wear out, break and start catching on carpet, floor mats and any other soft materials. They certainly provide walking safety and are great for occasional use before they wear out"
5,Four winters and going strong!,"I live in Seattle, where we don't get snow every year nor a ton of it, but when we do, it's often icy and icky for days. I'm on my 4th winter with the same pair of YakTrax and they're going great! Definitely recommend!"
1,Good While They Lasted,Performed very well but completely fell apart after two weeks. These may be good for occassional light use but for serious walking come up way short. I would not buy these again.
2,quality has slipped!,"These things used to last a few winters of short distance walking, but no more. Seems like the wire rusts awful fast on our new ones, and the stretch stuff is more brittle. They break now even more often, as the elastic gets cut by unraveling coils, and more recently loses its elasticity. Probably cheaper manufacturing!They have always acted like roller bearings on dry surfaces, so be careful or your feet will be sliding out from under you when you walk into a store or hit some dry pavement. Lucky they're easy to take on and off as you go inside, and we always carry a small plastic shopping bag to put them in our pockets, as they're usually full of snow and ice melt and sand.Best to keep them warm before putting them on!"
4,Yak Trak,I wanted to purchase Yaktrax Pro but they were not available. Yaktrax are truly wonderful for walking on ice. But they can pop off your shoes and I have already lost one. The Yaktrax Pro have a strap that goes over the foot so they can't come off. My resolve is no falls on ice this winter and it won't happen with Yaktrax. I have been telling all my friends and co-workers to buy them and I gave them to everyone in my extended family for Christmas.
5,Surprising,"When I first got these, they looked too wimpy to be effective. I am surprised at how easy they slip onto your shoes and they really do keep you from slipping on ice. Weirdly enough, they are a little slippery on bare concrete."
4,Yaktrax works,"Believe me the Yaktrax works on ice and snow, if you can't afford to take a fall, you can afford this product."
3,Work well but don't last,"IN SHORT: Worked well but didn't last long.IN DETAIL: These are fantastic for freezing rain, light icing and the like. Other people will slide all over the place while you walk normally. I did have issues when hiking on thick densely packed ice where even the Yaktrax slid so much I had to turn back. Lastly and most IMPORTANTLY, they only lasted about 30mi total use after which when the rubber on the bottom broken midway through a hike. Unfortunately the warranty is only good for 3 months so I would strongly recommend a different style that has only metal in contact with the ground."
4,Works great.,Put over any shoes. Will hold you secure when walking on ice. I carry them along in a bag and can slip them on when needed. Good product.
4,These are a life saver!,"Shipping was expedited, as these yaktrax were very much needed. I believe they have prevented a lot of injuries, by preventing my crewmembers from falling on the ice. Thank you so much"
1,Poor product; rubber easily breaks; slips off sometimes,"Don't buy this. Spend some extra money on a better product. My wife lost one (without realizing it) while walking on snow and then slipped on an icy spot and smashed up her right wrist and distal radius. She ended up needing an operation and a metal plate insert. I've had some bad experiences with this product as well; it often slips off, shifts up my shoe/boot -- and the rubber frequently breaks."
5,Snow Trax,"I've used many winter track items to put on my shoes. These are by far the easiest to put on - any shoe or boot- and work better than I have ever tried. After breaking my ankle last year I don't go out without them, especially this winter."
4,YAK TRAX WALKERS CLEATS FOR SNOW AND ICE,"WONDERFUL ITEM GREAT ON THE ICE, SNOW TENDS TO PULL THEM FROM THE SHOE IF IT IS DEEP AND HARD. WILL SLIP ON HARD FLOOR, WOOD, TILE,ETC. STILL OVERALL GREAT ITEM TO PURCHASE TO WALK ON ICE COVERED PARKING LOTS AND SIDEWALKS. GOING TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PAIR SOON"
3,Can't say yet...,"...because the dang order was shipped by the slowest method available. Don't order from this third party, because you pay a price for shipping that OUGHT to be 2nd or 3rd day, given how expensive it is, and it will be probably two weeks before you get the stuff."
2,Traction cleats for snow,"The cleats worked well at first but later one slipped off one of my shoes. Since it was transparent, it was extremely difficult to find it in the snow. Also, when wet they slipped dangerously on tile floors. I liked the idea of them being clear so they wouldn't be obvious when worn, but certainly was disappointed that one came off so easily. I had ordered the smallest size, so probably wouldn't recommend these unless one planned to take them off when indoors."
3,Not as good as Stabilicers,"These aren't too bad for my lightweight, younger kids, but they don't have real cleats, which means they don't dig into the ice they way Stabilicers do. They still do have the ability to damage floors, though. Not a waste of money but not my favorite."
4,Fantastic for a clumsy southerner,"We spent a winter in Ohio. Unfortunately for us, it was the most snow that had been in that part of OH for several years. On the bright side, this saved my workouts. I could still go for a jog even with snow on the ground. One caveat, though-be careful on the sidewalk that is composed of bricks-these make those types of surfaces infinitely more slippery!"
5,"great for snow, ice",Should have ordered these earlier this winter. Works well on snow and ice. Seniors should not be without them! Leave them on an old pair of shoes so you just have to slip on the shoes.
2,One month only,These last about a month. Had to get total of six of them for my parents to last through the winter. Guessing this is their profit strategy.
2,Didn't work for me,"I walk my dogs daily. I hoped that these would help keep me from falling on the unshoveled icy stretches of the sidewalk. They did that well. However, they were slippery on the clear part of the sidewalk. To get the best use from them, I would have to alternate taking them off and putting them on every 10-20 yards. That is not a good answer with dogs on leashes, and nowhere to prop while tugging them off my shoes. I tried two pair, thinking the first might have been flawed, but neither set lasted more than 10 miles, which is pretty poor quality. The plastic bands break so quickly, and sometimes you are left without one on the way back home. They got the second star because I didn't fall or even slip on the ice."
2,easy to lose,"I was disappointed by the ease that you can lose the pair from your boots. You always have to keep track of this while walking. Generally, though,on ice, it does have good traction. Another problem which can be dangerous is that the wires around the elastic can get undone and this can cut someone."
2,EP YakTrax Review,"I had heard such good things about these YakTrax, but I gave a pair to a friend of mine for Christmas, and within 1 week, they were broken - coil pulls away from the rubber. So I returned that pair and got another pair in return - same exact thing happened. Bought a pair for myself and haven't had the heart to wear them yet because I'm afraid they, too, will be shoddy."
3,By very far not Cresswell's best,"If you compare this book with another one written by JC like: ""Dead Ringer"", ""The Third Wife"", ""Conspiracy"" and obviously its prequels. You'll think that she wrote this book just to finish the series. Albeit is a thriller in more than half book it has its very boring parts, for example the Xmas dinner or how Melody or Nick ""fought"" with Josh at the gym among others. I agree that this book is more a personal biography of Melody and Nick and has almost nothing to do with Unit One. So I think that JC could had finish this series with another idea. This doesn't mean that this book is a waster but definitively not the best of the writer."
5,Satisfying end to a strong trilogy!,"Cresswell's stand-alone romantic suspense has been OK reads for me. Nothing that got me that excited but far better than some duds I've come across. Her Unit One trilogy featuring Nick Anwar and Melody Beecham was an unexpectedly enjoyable read starting with the two protagonists' romance. Melody is capable and strong without being brassy and harsh as I've found some kick-ass heroines to be; Nick is downright sexy and their romance develops at a pace that's realistic yet without losing any steam. That's the advantage of trilogies, I find. Lots of room to balance the romance and the action/suspense. Cresswell's trilogy beat Merline Lovelace's Cleo North-Jack Donovan trilogy hands down!"
3,Final Justice,"Melody Beecham is used to danger, but not to someone personally wanting revenge on her, although there are ample suspects when she becomes a target for murder. Over her brief career, she's seen that justice is done on dozens of people who are enemies of the US. As part of a secret organization in the government, it's her job to protect the United States, by any means necessary. Now, it seems to be someone's job to use just those means to eliminate her. Is it a career criminal, or is it more personal? It's up to the man who loves her to find out before she is taken out.*** Weaving a complex web of betrayal that spans decades, Ms. Cresswell delivers her trademark suspense to her legions of loyal fans. ***"
3,Yoga DVD,"The ""yoga studio"" & the demonstrators look totally oudated and low budget. If you can get past this it has some good ideas."
1,Indiferent product; laudable service,Bought the two dvd set. The exercises were a bit softer than what I was looking for; seemed to be aimed at continous gentle movement rather than stretching into and maintaining positions. There did seem to be the advertised several hours of viewing. However the menu navigation did not respond well either to playing on my computer or my dedicated dvd player; gave up trying after a while.Contacted the producer and prompt restitution was made. Five stars for service.
5,Comprehensive,"I have found this set of DVDs by John Schlorholtz to be easy to use, and I have enjoyed the varied experiences offered. With the real life students and the teacher's style of instruction these DVDs are pleasurable, and they also have been most beneficial to support getting my strength back and healing. Visiting friends and family new to yoga have joined me in practicing with the DVDs and have been surprised by how good they have felt as a result. It has been a treat to share this set and the accompanying results with those I care about. Thank you!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have been using John's DVDs several times each week for almost two years. As a 53-year-old woman with an average fitness level and no significant physical limitations, the DVDs have been wonderful for increasing my flexibility and over-all feeling of well-being. They are easy to use and to tailor for different workouts on different days. I have even found the chair DVD good for hotel rooms where I really don't want to get down on the carpet. John's approach is very accessible to persons new to yoga and for those who want a more ""gentle"" approach--both toward mind and body. I would highly recommend both DVDs."
5,I Love These Shoes!,"My son is 4 months old and I've tried a few other brands of shoes but none seemed to stay on his feet. I decided to try these shoes because I'd heard nothing but good things about them. Since the day we got them, he's worn them everyday. They are great! They stay on his feet and they give him traction when he's trying to roll over or stand with help. I also like them because they coordinate with pretty much every outfit he has. I like the shoes so much that I already bought the next size up for when he grows out of these! They are definitely worth the money!"
1,Although Cute-Not good quality,Although my son looked adorable in this I do not recommend it. The zipper was very poorly attached and constructed and was of low quality. I had to fight with him to get it on because it wouldn't start easily and the patience of a 13 month old is short. After trying to put it on for the 3rd time (we didn't want him in his carseat with it on so he wouldn't get too hot) it just plain broke. We tried to repair it but to no avail. He cruised around his aunt's house with the costume half open. Also the brown fur easily gets stuck in the zipper or ends up in your or your baby's mouth and nose.One good this is the style. It is much less baby-ish than the other bear costumes out there. It does have cool claws and good coloring.
2,Literary anthology or high school yearbook?,"The poems collected here are fine enough for the most part, but there's something jarring about the overall package that contains them. The book is filled with selfcongratulatory preambles and introductions, photographs and observations that are meant to represent the feel of being at a reading at the KGB Bar, but instead it feels as if you are rifling though someone's old yearbook. You know it matters a lot to the people inside, but there isn't enough there to hold your interest. I prefer the way in which the original KGB Bar Reader was put together, offering interesting prose with out all the fancy wrappings. And has anyone noticed that the essay included here by the bar's owner seems to [resemble] the introduction from the original book?"
1,Waste of money! No solutions.,"This book only provides stories on what RA is. If you are a student of RA, this book is suitable. However, if you are looking for solutions, look elsewhere. The book offers little advice on the actions one can take to combat RA."
5,Forbidden knowledge...,Women would ban this book if they could. Its very helpful in understanding women and staying out of the minefields that professional relationships can become.
3,NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS,Nolo books are very good for basic information on how to prepare/do things.This is a good basic book to have in your library for reference.
2,too long and detailed,"I read this book while working on my Master's degree in English history, with a focus on Thomas More. Even though I knew the background to the story, the story was still confusing. It alternated chapters from the Utopia that Quiroga was trying to found and chapters describing the author's adventures in researching the book. It was a strage juxtaposition and one that was not very effective. At points, the author's chapters described drunken outings and nonsenical adventures that made me wonder if the author had lost his mind while writing this book (or, conversely, if the author's chapters were more fiction than he tried to represent). I actually only made it through about 200 pages before I apathetically put the book down."
4,"Yep, it's a tarp","Not too much to say about it, it's a tarp, it's sturdy enough but not all that thick. Seems like it will hold up just fine but I'm sure the grommets will wear out if put under too much tension."
2,Worst in the Series,"Out of all the books in ""The Blair Witch Files"" I think this is the worst. I usually find myself very interested in these books, but this book bored me. I don't recommend this one."
5,Very very good rice!,"This brown rice is the best! I try to keep my weight down, so by microwaving this rice and steaming fresh vegetables dinner is served. This allows me a glass or two of wine and a snack later on. I love brown rice, but don't always have the time - even to make several portions the day before. This is the ticket!"
2,Simply yuck!,It does not taste well. I was expecting real sprouts and better seasoning but it was not simply that great.
2,tastes like cardboard,"This rice did not have any flavor, not the brown rice nuttiness you typically find. The rice was like eating cardboard or plastic-flavored particles from the container. Would not buy again. Back to trader joe's microwavable bags!"
3,sprouted brown rice,I am from the South and raised on rice. This product may be healthy but has no taste. I will try again in some type of dish but it will take alot to beat plain ole rice.
2,it's just ok. I prefer gogo rice ..,"The texture of Annie Chun's brown rice is much better than gogo rice.Texture is very good. It is like white rice. Texture of GOGO rice ismore rough. Taste is ok, not strong. If you like smell or taste ofbrown rice, buy gogo rice. If you don't, you may buy Annie Chun's.6.3-Ounce is not enough for me. GoGo rice is 7.4-Ounce.And mostly time, it cost more than gogo rice.Annie Chun's rice is more expensive, but less rice, and weaker tasteand smell."
2,about crashzilla,"I almost always fall in the pit and get eaten. Sometimes I knock off the head, but it is hard to. My little sister likes to play with it too. I don't like all the noise it makes, but it is very fun to play. I only paid about $15 for it and it was worth it."
2,Too Difficult For a 4-Year Old,"My son loves cars and wrecks (of course). I saw this advertised on TV and thought he would absolutely love it. It wasn't too hard to put together. My son got frustrated when he tried to play with it, however. You have to pull the car back and release it. My son didn't have the strength to do it by himself. When he would pull on the truck (on the ramp) the whole contraption would slide towards him. He played with it a couple of times and then no more. Maybe older children would like this toy and be better able to manipulate it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I think Hot Wheels has some great stuff out there....but this is definately NOT one of them. Putting it together is a pain in the neck..it's very hard to click every together and the instructions could not be more unclear. (be aware that the pieces do not come out again, so you're stuck with this large contraption to store afterwards). There is only one function...pull the truck back on the lever and try to hit the monster's chest....so we did....but it was virtually impossible to do. The truck keeps falling in the ""pit"" and gets eaten every time. It's just poorly designed. It's VERY loud and my intelligent 5-year old stopped playing after 10 minutes."
2,What a waste of money!,"My 5-year-old son is really into monster trucks, and he was so excited to get this toy. He saved his money for months to buy Crashzilla. This toy is fairly expensive--we paid $25 for it at our local target. It really only does one thing. You cock back the truck and aim it for the monster. You either get eaten or knock its head off. Wow! For $25 you'd expect a lot more. My son was bored with it in a few hours. A better choice for those young monster truck lovers are the Crank & Crush sets. They are only $12 and keep my son entertained for hours a day. Stay away from this one!!!"
4,Not Bad for 4 year olds,"We initially were not going to purchase this since it had gotten two bad reviews....but my four year old son has been obsessed with monster trucks for awhile and insisted on buying this. Anyway...yes, the instructions can be confusing but all in all our son played with it all day long. He loved getting his other Hot wheels Monster trucks and trying them on the track (they also work). He really got into setting up a HOt Wheels Monster truck challenge and was able to win against the Crusher. If your son LOVES Monster Trucks he will probably enjoy this toy."
2,Equipment selection,"If you are in an environment separated from process equipment and have to make selections/recommendations, it could be helpful. It contains reasonable descriptions of principles and better than catalog information on equipment. If you are in a hands on environment and actually using equipment to make products it does not help much."
3,Overwhelming,Tons of information but nearly useless for the process design course that I am taking this semester. Avoid paying full price because it is like a big reference book
2,ugh.,"I'm a pretty big fan of Arnold movies but this one is actually pretty terrible, and not in the typical fun way. Just boring, looks terrible and plain not fun. How can an Arnold movie not be fun? By being The Runing Man, or maybe End of Days."
3,Just as I Suspected (while sitting in my chair stroking a cat),3 out of 5...nuff said...fun...maria conchita alonzo's acting annoys me...but looking back...eh. Standard Arnold-fun movie...Family Fued guy plays an awesome slime ball
2,DVD settings,Found out it works on a different dvd regional setting. Order and shipping was complete and well received. However the settings don't work on my end. Thanks. :/
1,Misinformed,This movie does not play on my DVD player it says check region code meaning it won't play on American DVD players even though it stated it would
5,very important book,this book very important to who's want to understand better in photography. it is importatnt becuase to expousre correctly it must to understand behind
1,Energy Gummy Worms,I've had these at a gas station before. I would go 20 miles out of my way just to buy these. Then the gas station stopped selling them. :( I finally found them on here after a year I was so excited but when they got here they were very very hard every package I got. I believe I bought 6. It was just very disappointing.
5,All I CAN SAY IS THAT THE BOOK WAS GREAT !!!!!!!!!,The baby sitters club girls rae my favourite book carecters. they are sooo awsom. The mystery Abby and the notorios neibourgh was one of the best books Ann M. Martin ever wrote.
5,It was one of my favorite BSC books I have ever read!!!!!!!!,I loved this book! I would reccomend to any BSC fan! I loved every single part of the book! I couldn't wait to find out what happend next! 3 words. READ THIS BOOK!
4,Tethering ?,"I purchased Bibble Pro in hopes it would make taking product shots for our mail order business a little easier. I was mainly interested in the tethering option. I found the provided instruction manual lacks all information on tethering and the tutorials, although helpful did not cover this ether.With the help of online fourms and a few hours of dabbling I was able to get it to work. It's not hard to do once you get the needed help. It seems to me the manual should have addressed tethering, that would have been helpful.Over all I like the program and would recommend it for easy to use and powerful batch processing. After getting Bibble I started shooting in RAW full time because it's easy to view, correct, and convert to jpg, tiff , ect...After a couple of product shot sessions I'm finding I do save time with Bibble Pro tethered to my Nikon D80, I wouldn't give it up. The basic tools are easy to use and work well."
2,"nice program, abominable customer service","I love the program. It makes photoshop almost unnecessary for a lot of my photos and it's very fast because you don't have to keep opening and saving. It's easy to copy settings from one photo to another. HOWEVER, I cannot get any minor problems addressed by the company. I waited 10 days for them to respond to an email about an installation issue, and they only responded because I threatened to start writing reviews. I am now waiting 4 days for a followup. I can't get into their forums because they won't recognize me as a customer so I can't get advice that way. I also find the interface confusing but I'm hoping they fix that in version 5. In the meantime, unless you're confident you can figure anything out on your own, BEWARE."
3,MAZE-LIKE INTERFACE,Great program but for the convoluted and labyrinthian interface. I hope v.5 is so long in coming because they are addressing this issue.
4,Bibble Pro,"Good..but the same as Bibble Light, unless you are batch processing. With a hefty additional price tag"
2,Not bad - but not as advertised.,"The wheel is advertised as ""Bakelite"" and it isn't. It's probably ABS - durable, but Bakelite would have been more durable and heavier - that would give it a better ""feel"". The center wheel is solid and spins smoothly. The felt was heavy and good quality. The red color was dull and not as shown. The chips were fair.Amazon paid for return shipping and gave a full refund - good job Amazon.I decided to go with the wooden wheel (12 inch) sold on Amazon, and bought the felt and chips separately."
5,Gundam Wing! Need I say more?,"Hm... I happen to LOVE this book. I own it. Bought it at a different website (animenation.com) with a different cover, but it's the same pictures... And the pictures are great! There were quite a few I hadn't seen before (example 1: the one of Treize and Une's head from the side. example 2: one with both Milliardo and Zechs (Milliardo with his mask on) from the side and a full shot of Noin from the front). The whole thing is layed out very nicely. I give it... *drumroll* Ten out of ten thumbs up! Eh... Right. Anyway..."
3,Take the Pre-requisites First!,"At my school the pre-req for the class using this book is VECTOR CALCULUS. But, your experience will really depend on how the class is taught. If it is taught as a graduate class, you will need you need an introduction to analysis, including maturity in understanding and writing rigorous proofs. after taking the class and doing very well (after a long struggle), I have come to the conclusion that although it doesn't require Measure Theory, ""elementary calculus"" is not going to cut it. If this is your first course in Probability, you should have taken the following: Discrete Math(for first part of the book) , multi-variable Calculus , and a proof-based class(this will help you tremendously throughout the book). Also, know your infinite series!"
1,Horrible in every aspect,"This book is just terrible. The examples don't help you do the problems. The answers in the back of the book are completely random, they're all over the place and some are even, some are odd. But some are randomly listed."
3,Examples and Errors,"There are many good and bad things about this book, so:Pros:1) Lots of examples. Probability can be complicated (especially combinatorics), and math is learned via examples (at least for me).2) Lots of exercises. There are a HUGE number of exercises, and answers for them are usually in the back of the book (just the numerical values).Cons:1) Example format. A lot of important concepts are defined within the examples, which is a pet peeve of mine, since it's hard to go back and find important information quickly.2) ERRORS! Some of the answers in the back of the book are numbered wrong. This is the eighth addition; this should be fixed by now.3) The book is fairly flimsy.I figured this book deserves three stars. There are many better books out there, for people who have choice of which book to buy. For example, one of my favorites is Probability and Random Processes by Geoffrey Grimmett and David Stirzaker."
1,worst probability book out there.,"I dont know why professors continuously use this worthless book but they do! PLEASE stop! poor examples, poor introduction, poor everything. the author could have done a much better job if he had gone into detail. take another class if you can use a different book!"
3,Not a first course at all,"well I got this book for my Probability course, in my opinion the book is only useful when you have a good understanding about the basic subjects, but I dont recommend it as your first probability book.there are lots of examples in the book but they do not follow a logical order, which I really did not like, and if you dont understand a specific subject, the book doesn't help much with that."
4,nice textbook,Ihe book is nice as a textbook for an introductory course in probability. It has a large collection of examples.
2,book pages are scambled.... wtf...,pages would go from 234 to 345 then to 235... how am i suppose to read it?
1,As you have read,"As you have read from the previous reviewer, this book isn't a good book if you do not have any background in probability. In fact, I don't understand the examples in the book even though I understand my professor perfectly and get full marks on my homework and quizzes. The problem with the book is that it introduces new notations out of the blue and doesn't explain what those notations means. It is equivalent to changing the language to Chinese all of the sudden and expecting you to understand it. You can't understand an example if you don't know what the symbols and notations represent in words. In addition to that, it jumps from the first step to the conclusion with the explanation of ""it's obvious"" ""obviously ""clearly"" and so on. You'll be quick to see that nothing is obvious. If it was, you wouldn't need the textbook."
1,good book if you already know probability,quite possibly the worse book i have ever read on the subject. examples dont have anything to do with the theorems he has just introduced. and the examples are all over the place. how do you have 80 examples or more per chapter and none of the examples relate to each other? he puts the most mundane topics where some examples are like 3 page solutions. just plain horrible if you ask me. you will not learn probability from this book
4,bah,i hate the book personally but i needed it for class. fj fds fdsa erw fajlk;a fejioa;fj ajfhraljf sfdf fsd
4,Good book if you have some math under your belt,"I used this book for the one probability course I took during my undergraduate, and I liked using it. I feel like the book could have used more examples of the most important topics rather than having sections on less important topics like the zeta distribution or the Weibull distribution. Having sections on topics like this make the subject seem more bigger and more overwhelming than it has to be."
1,BOO,"This book is terrible. Everyone I've spoken to who's used it agrees. Here's why: the language is dated and distant and hard to connect with, the examples are boring, the organization is, well, it's there but it's not too helpful if you're trying to actually learn something because it assumes that you know everything from class. This book is like a reminder for probability pros maybe. If you're assigned this book I'd recommend either going to class and understanding everything the first time it's explained, or take a different class."
4,String Winder,"The D'Andrea SW1 String Winder does the job without any problems and is ""hefty"" enough to last a lifetime."
5,A vivid depiction of the play!!,"I'm surprised nobody ever told me about this movie until I watched it last week?? Dustin Hoffman is terrific as Willy Loman; he conveys particular well, the emotions of the character. I really liked this movie. You should watch it!!"
4,Theatre class assignment.,"This movie was part of an assignment for a college theatre class. since, all the video stores in my area have closed, I opted to watch this online. The price was good, the quality was good and I could watch it anytime and how many times I wanted in a time period. No late fees,either."
5,one of the greatest movies ever made,Dustin Hoffman is awesome in this movie. I enjoyed this movie 100%. There were no boring parts to me. It's interesting all the way through.
2,Hoffman never gets under Loman's skin,"Perhaps that's because he's so obsessed with SHOWING US that skin. His performance is a dizzying kaleidoscope of affected, non-organic mannerisms and an unconvincing imitation of an old man's voice. His Willie Loman is like a cartoon character. I could never even get involved in the picture -- I kept watching Hoffman and wondering, ""What was he thinking?"" A very unconvincing performance.While Hoffman has given brilliant character performances in the past (Tootsie, Midnight Cowboy), this one unfortunately is a failure."
1,This version falls WELL short of greatness,"I just viewed the 1985 Dustin Hoffman version of ""Salesman"" and I have to say that this version is pretty bad in comparison to others. Dustin Hoffman portrays Willie like a little insignificant insect, not as a powerful demanding person. John Malcovich is offbeat as Biff, and Kate Reid missed the boat as Linda. This does not however, mean I dislike the play. THe play is marvelously written and is a classic. If you want to see the show done right, I recommend the Brian Dennehy/Elizabeth Franz version. THat one gets 4 stars."
3,"Didn't quite like title song, & contents of CD too limited","Like A Rose is not really a legendary hit like I'll Be The One (BSB), Same Old Brand New You (A1, 2000 release). I thought that Ben Adams (lead singer), sounded a bit nasal on this song, and the title and lyrics didn't make much sense. In a way, it is awkward for a boyband to sing phrases like ""Treat me like a rose..."" Coupled with Ben's voice, it somehow is not a really perfect song to listen to when you are feeling bored or need to relax. However, a good try by A1, and still quite presentable, otherwise this song wouldn't have earned a place in the TOP 10.The CD does not have much -- only the title track, an instrumental song and a remix (I don't really like remixes for I think originals are always gems). Quite an expensive single considering there are only 2 tracks with lyrics..."
4,Flamingo Vanilla Decaf Sugar-Free Chai,"Wonderful! I mix it with Trader's Chai mix and 1/2 teaspoon of Trader's chocolate powder,with heated milk, for the best morning drink!"
5,Solid wisdom for everyone; no gimmicks here.,"I heard an interview with Sister Wendy on NPR's Fresh Air, and found it hard to believe a person could be so intrinsically good. I was skeptical, but curious too, since she had spent years in a Carmelite Order in which silence is the rule. Still, I remained skeptical until I looked over Sister Wendy's books in a bookstore--they were hard to find, and found that her Meditations had a great deal of wisdom in it--on silence, peace, love, and joy. Each meditation was based on a dozen or so works of art (Sister Wendy is best known her books and PBS programs on art appreciation), and all reflect the essence of Christianity--the Christianity that has become so rare in this era of the religious right. I am happy to recommend it to anyone; her words are consistent with all the great world religions. As with all of them, there are no easy answers, but there are many solid things to work on--for a long time, for most of us."
3,"Crazy, but Well Done","As a previous reviewer stated, given her background, this is VS's opinion. She explaines her ""out-there"" philosophies in a very intelligent and well thought out manner. The scary thing is that one finds themselves thinking, ""Huh. She makes sense.""The SCUM Manifesto is blatant, in-your-face, irreverantly anti-male. It is also intelligent, well thought out, well organized and clearly written. It is rare that such outlandish philosophies are so well written."
4,Great Tarp,This is a wonderful tarp for the price! It is really huge. We use it to cover our boat for the winter.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I ordered this tarp for my boat it is not 10mil and after putting it up you could see bad places all over it.But am stuck with it.So if you are thinking of getting this save your money it's junk.
1,does not last,"I bought this ""heavy duty UV treated"" tarp to cover some equipment that gets Virginia sun two-thirds of the day. Less than a year later it was completely rotted away. I bought a second tarp off Amazon not realizing I was ordering the same one (the ""heavy-duty UV treated"" sold me again). Same thing happened....it is 9 months later and the tarp is rotting out with holes a couple of feed across. So unless you intent to use this in the shade to protect only from rain, I'd suggest a different brand."
2,sizing,30' side was only 28.5' and one side the cut was not straight it was tapered. Had to use 2 bungee cords on side to reach grommets.
1,Heavy Duty?,I ordered this because it said it was heavy duty but after just one camping trip I had several of the tie down metal circle things come loose.
3,"Good for rain, but not full sun","I bought two of these last year to cover two boats in my back yard. They did the job of keeping the rain off, but disintegrated over the summer (I'm in Southern California). I've looked for something better, but it seems that if the cover blocks sun and lasts for years, it is not water proof. If it is water proof it will not be able to withstand constant exposure to the sun.I have purchased two more (its rainy season), and will soon get a quality shade cloth and supports to keep out sun. That is an extra $200 plus for me, but hopefully it will keep things cool and covered. I'll update after next summer with results.So basically, these covers are great if they are not exposed to sun for long periods of time and no worse than any other similar water-proof covers. If you need waterproof and sun resistant, you will probably need a combination of two different types of covers."
4,"Good, but be careful","Its plenty heavy enough. And it will never fold/roll/collapse to be nearly as small as the packaging it came in, cause it is BIG!Be very careful when staking/roping it off. The grommets are not exactly 'tight' in place, and will start to pull/tear out under winds or tight ties. Recommend combining two grommets together iwth a string, and roping to that.Overall, solid tarp, and does exactly what I wanted. Brown up doesn't stand out much, and the silver is really just gray, but reflects some light downward when its on the bottom, which is nice. Sun certainly won't go through."
4,Exactly what I ordered,"This tarp was exactly what we were looking for. We needed somethig to cover a couple cords of wood that are curing since we're going into the rainy season and don't have a shed to stack it in. The free shipping made it extremely worth it, as no local store has a tarp of this size that's not blue. (I would hate a blue tarp in my yard)"
1,Yuck,"Either the bars were very old or the recipe isn't my cup of tea. Bought two boxes. Threw them out after sampling three bars. There is other Promax stuff that is fine, however."
2,It would be great--if it was well written.,"Suffer through it, and I suppose you'll learn a thing or two about the publishing industry."
4,"Charming, Entertaining and full of talent","This is my first Martha Grimes story, but not my last. She is funny and talented. She is not as funny as Janet Evanovich but certainly more talented from a literary stand point. Her twists and subplots remind me of Tim Dorsey, since your never quite sure what she is up to from one page to the next. Is she better than Diana Mott Davidson, you bet. So plop down in a comfy seat and get ready to ride the quick action."
1,Really Boring!,After reading reviews by some of my favorite authors about this book I felt I needed to read it. Everyone was raving about it. I was completely disappointed! Maybe people that know the publishing industry from the inside find it funny for reasons we mere mortal readers do not. My advice to those readers that like the Richard Jury books is to skip this failed attempt at humor by Grimes.
2,Where were the funny parts??,"The glowing reviews on the cover made this book sound like a fun read. It wasn't. This book really challenged my attention span, I kept wondering if it was ever going to get better. Summary: Mischevious writer sets up another one to be murdered, just for fun. The hit men, completely unbelievable cultured theatre lovers turn out to be the nicest people in the story. This was the first Martha Grimes I have read and I am in no hurry to try another. I happen to love subtle humor, but this was so subtle I missed it."
1,Boredom Plus F-Words,"I loved Martha Grimes' early Richard Jury novels, and then, over time, they just got formulaic. This book was supposed to be ""hilarious"", or so the cover blurbs promised. It was one big ""inside joke"", that barely caused a wry smile now and then. Save your money."
4,Foul Matter,"This book was not a typical Grimes book. There seemed to be too much repetitive descriptions of people waiting to be published. The book seemed to plod along until the introduction of the two hit men, Candy and Karl. They provided the chuckles. The book was toted as being a spoof on the publishing business, and that it was. However, I do not think this was her best book. I enjoyed her others more."
4,An amusing send up of book publishing,"Martha Grimes' latest takes an amusing swipe at the publishing industry and its inhabitants. While there are generous and delicious pokes at the industry itself, Grimes takes aim at all involved from editors to authors. It is an enjoyable romp. I had a bit of trouble keeping the cast of characters straight as more and more joined in the stalking of author Ned Islay, but it didn't hinder my enjoyment one bit. Hit men Candy and Karl are great characters. Actors will fight each other to play them if this makes it to film. Bravo, Martha!"
4,Insider's Wonderful Satire on Publishing,"If you have ever worked in or around publishing or have ever been published you will laugh your way through Grimes' new novel.Although there are a few rough edges, this book is impossibly hilarious, clever, depressing and hopeful, all at the same time."
1,Complete rubbish,Grimes has forgotten everything she has learned about plotting and character development in this venture about the world of publishing.
5,Finally something good to read!,"If you are fairly literate and want to read something that will entertain you from page one, read this book. If, instead, you prefer a book that is dull as dust, don't bother. (But life is too short to waste time reading boring books.) I'm not a huge MG fan and I really enjoyed this book. I kept trying to steal time to read it. This is good stuff. Buy this book."
5,Christmas Music Lover,"This is now my favorite traditional Christmas album--and I have a large collection. Callie has a beautiful, clear voice, and the moving but unembellished accompaniments showcase the message of the season. If you love traditional carols for their simple and profound beauty, you'll love this album. The two newer songs Some Children See Him and The Jesus Gift blend wonderfully with the older ones. I discovered Callie while looking for The Twelve Days After Christmas. The version I sampled on a comedy album was disastrous, so I took a chance on Callie. She sings this song with the same dignity as the others, and this heightens the humor of the lyrics. She is just a very, sweet young lady who becomes desperate and has to do ""something"" with all those crazy gifts! I'll be looking for more albums by Callie. Hopefully, this is the first of many."
5,Simply The Best,"If you have never heard the ""Gates"" you have missed one of the true miracles of music. What they do with the human voice is nothing short of astounding. If you love R&B, DooWop, or Blues, listening to the Golden Gate Quartet will give you a big piece of their evolutionary puzzle."
4,get this dvd to increase your chops,I have his first dvd and the lessons are clear and easy to understand. I have been playing drums professionally for 25yrs. and the grooves that I have learned from that dvd increased my ability to play in many different situations. that's why when I found out he had another dvd out 2.0 I jumped at getting it. Big Rock delivered on time and brand new sealed in box. A++++ rating.Thanks
5,another great DVD from Mr. Igoe,"Tommy Igoe expanded the collection of grooves and got into more complex ones. Again described in detail, in simple words. Some grooves I have never heard of and seem pretty obscure :-), but I believe once mastered they would become great addition to any drummer's arsenal. I recommend buying this in package with the book and CD - play along tracks are great to play with and book provides variations of original grooves to try."
4,Chinese Label Art: 1900 - 1976,"I completely enjoyed this whole book,It was well put together with much written info & the outstanding photos kept me looking & reading all afternoon.For me personally,I have an interest in Chinese firework/firecracker labels that I collect.Now I have seen all the unreal labels the Chinese used on all their products in the past.I have a new respect for the labels in this book,& what products their on,wild."
4,Great,This was delivered on time and what I was told it was really beautiful basket. Just one basket the card was not included but the other was.
4,"Wonderful basket, but no note","Even if you select ""gift option"" as I read on the description, a note will not be included with this product. I was very careful to make sure the gift options were selected, but this product was sent without a note, so the receiver didn't even know who it was from. It's a wonderful basket, but I am giving only 4 stars due to the missing note."
1,Not comprehensive only skims the surface,"If you only casually follow his career you've seen all this work before. There are no real insights into his process, just a bunch of glossy computer renderings done in Form-Z with no depth. Go to a library and look for back issues of DOMUS magazine. They've done much more in depth articles on Newson's work. This book is a marketing brochure."
4,"sturdy, good hand feel, needs sharpening","14 in Taste of Italy Pizza chopper. Came well packaged. Solid steel construction with blade centered under cylinder of continuous steel handle. Blade came out of the box a little rough with burrs - none of the burrs were loose. Cut only so-so until given a few strokes through a graduated ceramic sharpening stone. Now slices pizza quickly and must admit it is a heck of a lot of fun to use and flourish. Would have to put a finer edge on for herb chopping but did try rocking it over smashed garlic cloves for a khalbi marinade and it was a lot of fun to use. Kinda big for that job but still a hoot. length barely fits into a standard kitchen drawer. For the price, I highly recommend for the beginner gourmand/chef. Caution: size may push this into the weapon/sword category for APO/FPO shipping downrange if you run into a nit-picky customs agent when trying to bring this back home."
3,It's a Barbie,"For Christmas this year, I bought my eight year old daughter the entire Wizard of Oz cast. Barbie as Glinda is 2nd only to Dorothy. Glinda's dress is beautiful, and she even talks. I imagined my daughter spending hours acting out her favorite scenes from the book and movie instead of the usual Barbie and Ken scenes. Her imagination has been sparked, but I still had to insist that she not change any of the Wizard of Oz characters' clothes. Ken as the Tin Man, Lion, and ScareCrow are good as well. If you're considering buying as a collector, I highly recommend the whole set. If you're considering buying it because you want to discourage your child's usual way of playing with Barbies, give it up."
3,"Not bad, but a little silly","I got this as a gift. It was a nice gift. It was a thoughtful gift. But it was a quite silly gift. It works quite well, and has cleaned out my grinder fairly nicely. But I think it would have been just as useful for someone to buy a pastry brush for 1/5th the price and then tell me... ""Oh, it's a coffee grinder brush.""My recommendation? Get a pastry brush and use that. Just make sure you use it only for the coffee grinder. Using my old pastry brush was making my coffee grounds a little buttery... ;P"
1,If you like horror movie music from the 60's you'll LOVE...,"I bought this thinking it would be relaxing but I couldn't get to sleep until I shut it off. It's really creepy-sounding, like bad horror movie music. I returned it the next day."
5,Great Read,"Many reviews discuss the legitimacy of the research and consequently, the results. I'm not a psych major and don't have my PhD, but my first thought is, does it matter? He's right. This book isn't being distributed in social studies classes, either. Even if he comes off opinionated, he is still not far off the mark. I understand this doesn't apply to everyone (as does the author), and I'm on the same page with some rules more than others, but as a culture, he's not far off. I don't think that Proctor and Gamble or Jeep care so much about his research methods when they got the results they did. It was his job to ""sell"" himself and his methods to his clients; and he did just that. Not to mention this book really is just a good read, and it's fun to learn about other cultures this way."
2,Arbitrary conclusions; difficult to read,"There aren't many books I just don't like, but this was one. Rapaille comes across as an elitist who's tricked everyone into believing he's a guru. I would compare Rapaille to some know-it-all 'expert' at the art gallery who raves about the artist's use of light, color, and internal meaning, only to find out later that the painting was done by an elephant with a brush in its trunk (i.e. waaaay too much meaning assigned to random things). The same is true here. Rapaille's conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable, and you or I could spout the same arbitrary theories. For example, because Americans consume a lot of hamburgers, I hereby declare that the culture code for America is a cow. See? It's easy. This type of random link between unrelated things (and the unsupportable claim that they're not random and they ARE related)is what you get with this book. Rapaille's only genius is in convincing corporate America that he is one."
4,Why you do what you do,"Among a lot of things, Rapaille explains why you like or dislike the taste of coffee in the morning, and why Americans prefer action over consideration and evaluation.Many of us (particularly academics that want theories published in peer-reviewed journals), will not like what he has to say about why we do certain things, but sometimes the brutal truth cuts to the quick and forces us out of denial. At the least his proclamations will provoke discussion and introspection.Rapaille's book unfortunately does not have an outline or flow chart. You will learn much more about yourself and the choices you make and have made, if you also watch his interview videos on the 'net."
4,Abre las mentes!,Es una visión muy interesante que refleja el pensamiento de una persona especializada en el comportamiento humano a profundidad. Abre un nuevo estilo de pensamiento en la industria.
3,"Good information, but is true?","I first saw Dr. Rapaille on CBS's the Persuaders. I was extremely intrigued in his method of acessing people unconcious buying habits. So, I went ahed and order this book. This book has a lot of valuble information on the different codes of different cultures. Except, it seems a lot like sterotyping, and I can be certain these codes are accurate. Also, The Culture Code gets reall repetivie in style. Still I enjoyed the insight I recieved from this book."
2,Started Strong but lost momentum,"Having marketed and sold in every region of the globe, I was naturally drawn to Clotaire Rapaille's ""The Culture Code."" Rapaille utlizes a one word ""code word"" which you could characterize an ""emoticon descriptor"" for a product or service, such as ""HORSE"" for the the Jeep Wrangler, or ""DISAPPOINTMENT"" for Love. He caught my interest up front with an overview of the process behind his code labeling, but as the book progressed, never provided a road map as to the analysis behind the process except the end results surrounding vanity areas of health, beauty, sex, home, money and other emotional areas. But nothing regarding hard business analysis. His premise is that we all look at the world differently due to our childhood driven, hard wired cultural experiences, causing stark differences between the emotional quotient of Europeans, Asians and Americans. At the end, the chapters were fairly repetitive recapping the first, and strongest in the book."
2,Rapaille's book = SHILL,"I went into this book expecting a well-researched comparison of different cultures and how those differences affect how products are perceived and marketed. In the end, I was short-changed. The ""research"" is largely absent and is presented as anecdotal impressions from survey participants that don't hold consistent themes. Unfortunately, Rapaille chooses to make sweeping generalizations about these results, always trying to distill the entire spectrum of participant responses into single catch phrases. But if he couldn't do that, he wouldn't have a book, would he?Further, he overemphasizes the American point of view far too much, and provides too little on other non-American cultures.Save your money and check it out from the library if you're remotely interested."
2,Clueless,"A Frenchman trying to psycho-analize and understand the American culture. While he is successfull in some extent, he is completely clueless most of the times.One clear conclusion is that Mr. Rapaille has some fixed ideas imposed by his ""Cultural Code"" impeding him to deeply understand other cultures.In my opinion, this book is very shallow appreciation of the cultural differences that goes nowhere."
5,Incredibly useful information,"I saw Dr. Rapaille on a Frontline episode a few years back describing culture code, however the inner workings were obscured to protect his business model. This book reveals the process of how he arrives at the code for love, sex, money, fat, work, and others.His cross comparisons to French, British, German and Japanese cultures are incredibly enlightening and reflect our own American culture back to us.I wish the current administration had hired Dr. Rapaille to find the code for Iraq prior to our invasion. It would have been very useful in determing how we would manage the situation.Enough politics...the book is a fast read and will alter the way you see your relationship to your culture and possibly have you questioning why you do what you do."
3,"Slightly short, mediocre quality, but cheap","The good:> This product has the everlast logo on it, making it brand attractive.> dries out fast> colour does not run> slightly stretchable> bundle of 3 pairs makes it ship to shipThe bad:> at 104 inches (264 cm), this wrap is quite short> the everlast logo is not centered, which reflects on the quality and care in the making> material stretches out unevenly"
2,good quality but very short,"These would be best suited for a child, woman or a man with very small hands. Offered little protection and coverage. Was not very satisfied and they are now sitting in a box in my home gym while I use other ones."
5,Awesome handwraps,"I purchased this wraps for my Tae Bo classes. I use them to make sure that my hands are always closed when I'm punching. Mostly for good form. I used them to punch mitts. I absolutelly loved them! I read the reviews and some said that these were a bit short. It has been perfect for me, I have small hands but still the wraps are so long! I encourage these for everybody!"
4,"Good quality, good packaging","These are sturdy wraps and you get 3 sets to the package that came in a mesh tote for storage. It would have been nice if the tote had a drawstring, but otherwise a good product."
4,Good Value,"These are good wraps, descent quality for the price. Depending on how you like to wrap your hands you may want to look at a longer length but to get 3 pairs for this price is definitely a plus."
2,"Nice ones, but a little short and not durable","I tested this wraps for about two months and one pair of them got damage, the threads unpicked in the velcro zone so I have to stitch the handwraps to prevent them from lose the velcro."
5,very good product,"i just started taking kick boxing classes and buying all the basic equipment . This seemed to work very well and on Amazon, it is about 80% off the price that you would pay in the gym so highly recommend anyone buying this."
3,Decent Wraps,"I have an old pair of the same Everlast handwraps that needed replacing so I purchased these.The length is great and they are perfect for what they are made for. I use them under boxing gloves for use on a heavy bag. I got them for $10 and they were worth the price.I do feel that they were thinner and the material was rougher than my old wraps though. I'm not sure if they changed the quality of them, but those were downsides in my opinion.After being wrapped around your hands, I have found that the velcro strip exceeds the length of the soft velcro attached to the wrap. The contact between the extra rough velcro and the actual wrap has caused the material to wear.However, even though I am compairing them to my other wraps, I would still recommend them. They are inexpensive and work well, but if you are looking for great quality or heavy duty wraps I do not feel these would be best."
2,Have started to fall apart after only 5 uses,"These are shorter than normal so you can't wrap your hand quite as well. They also are becoming frayed and the velcro bit that is sewed on is starting to come off. I can't imagine they'll be functional after a few more uses. The only pros are that they're cheap and come in a 3 pack. Next time I'm going to get a higher quality, longer wrap. Don't bother with these."
4,Good Quality Hand Wraps - Recommended,"This set contains three sets of 108"" Everlast Hand Wraps in Red, Black, and White colors. I was concerned about the shorter length of these since I have large to X-large hands and need to have good wrapping to support my wrists. These were just the right the size, covering my wrists and knuckles with several layers. While others have noted that the 180"" length wraps provide better protection, I find that is too much material to have under my light gloves for heavy bag work and light contact sparing.The material is good quality and doesn't tend to bunch up on itself while wrapping. The built in ""Thumb Loops"" are very handy and does allow these wraps to be put on by yourself, which is a big plus, and the Velcro fastener is fairly long, providing a secure hold throughout a long workout.Recommended, with the above length caveat.CFH"
2,"Weak velcro stitching, too short to provide adequate padding","I ordered these as a total novice for simple heavy bag workouts about three months ago. I was pleased with them at first, but now I'm ordering something else. On one of the three sets the stitching holding the velcro down came completely apart during the very first wear. The others are now weakened too. I had a friend restitch them. I like that they're 100% cotton, but that means that the crinkle up and can be hard to wrap flat. I run a hot iron over them now and then. Finally, now that I've been in training a few months, I'm hitting much harder, and these wraps just aren't long enough to provide enough padding. My knuckles are bruising during training."
4,GOOD,"NOT MUCH TO IT. DON'T WASH THESE WITHOUT FIRST SECURING THE VELCRO. I DIDN'T AND RUINED ONE OF THE THE WRAPS. STILL, NOT MUCH TO IT."
3,way to small,These hand wraps are way to short and thin. These were 108's and its best to have 180's. I couldnt remember seeing how long they were before buying.
2,Watch Out!,"These handwraps are very short. 108"" is not the ideal length and I was very unhappy to find this out. I would suggest a much longer handwrap. Especially if you're a beginner, like myself, you need much longer handwraps for the support because longer handwraps allow you to have cross-finger support as well as the much needed wrist support. DON'T BUY. GET LONGER HANDWRAPS!!"
2,really uncomfortable,The wrap is really short to wrap around your hands efficiently. The material is also not comfortable. Feel like it scratches on your skin.
3,Meh,"I bought these for my muay thai classes, so that I wouldn't have to choose between frequent washing of wraps, or using stinky wraps. These are pretty short which is fine for my tiny hands and wrists, but the fabric has no stretch. They're kind of rough and come loose very easily. While it's nice to have enough wraps to cycle through my three classes each week, I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Good for lighter training,"I just started my boxing training and these are the first hand wraps that I have bought and used. I got this mainly because it is a good deal at three hand wraps for roughly ten dollars. I bought these with the understanding that they are short for average sized hands, so I'm not jumping on the length.I would mainly want to recommend for those who are starting out to try a hand wrap that has an elastic material. The elasticity allows the wraps to be more flexible and contours to the shape of your hands more easily. Also the elastic material wraps(which I bought a set recently) is more durable. Good deal on this set. But for more serious training, try an elastic pair of hand wraps."
2,Way too thin for practical use,"My boxing instructor looked at these brand new out of the package and shook his head. They aren't thick enough to adequately cushion the knuckles. Way to short to compensate with additional padding. I worked out with them anyway, and paid the price. Spend the extra dough and buy quality hand wraps"
2,No Quality,"I have been boxing for about a year now, tried these wraps and they both tore apart after one sparring. I thought these would last much longer than one day, but after this I am down to two handwraps from the get go. So I am not sure how everybody else is holding up with their own but, all I know is I am staying away."
1,Garbage,I owned a pair of hand wraps for over 6 months without the issues these have. The velcro is stronger than the stitching. Cheap. Lasted one use.
1,Do not buy,"After one wash, the wraps have threads coming apart everywhere. This is not the quality product I expect from amazon or everlast. I have owned everlast wraps and they lasted me over a year, these will not last the month."
2,I used to think Everlast was a name to trust.,"When I was younger it seemed to be,I still have a couple of these lying around from back then and they are durable and tough.You'd never know that these were the same ones.This pack came with three badly made, cheap products that me and my friends were disappointed with.Gone are the durable straps from the old ones, replaced with ugly, smelly white velcro ones.Thanks for taking a nose dive in quality, Everlast!"
5,Perfect!,As always Everlast is the best n boxing and the prce on these was beyond perfect! Super fast shippng as always.
4,"A bit rough, but not bad IF your wrap correctly.","These wraps are a little bit cheap, but they're durable and they'll hold up just fine to wear. They're a bit on the rough side and the first few times I wore them my knuckles got scrapped open and bled, but after about two months of having them I just have really tough knuckles and they don't bother me. If you've got big hands, go for 180"" wraps, these aren't long enough. If your a female and you care about how your hands look and don't want them to get a rough feel, go for softer wraps. Otherwise (I guess that leaves guys with small hands and girls who want rough hands) go for it.Side note: Wash them, if you don't (I used a set 4 days straight cause I was out of town and still wanted to train) for some reason they start to smell like garlic bread. Not a bad smell but a good garlic bread smell. I was kinda grossed out so I tossed 'em. Wash your wraps."
1,READ REVIEWS! These things are freakisly small,"It's on the title for the actual package, but not in amazon title... junior wraps, itsy bitsy... do not fit normal peopleI saw good reviews and bought without reading more, my mistake"
1,Useless!,"These are indeed the short, static hand wraps. You don't want static wraps, period. They're also too short."
1,do not bother,"i know this 3 pack may seem like a great value but these wraps are so not worth it. do yourself a favor and buy a better quality wrap, one with proper elasticity which these wraps have none of. wraps are uncomfortable enough but when you buy a better quality wrap, the added elasticity increases your comfort level. i'd also recommend going with the longer 180"", mexican style, wraps so you can use that added length to properly wrap your thumb, in between fingers, and more layers to your crucial knuckles and wrists. title brand 180"" wraps only cost $4 so spend a couple more dollars on better wraps."
2,I would look into another set of wraps,I dont know what the deal is with these wraps. I have been using everlast products for 20 years and have never had a set of wraps just fall apart on me in a matter of days like these ones have. Its possible that I might have recieved a manufacturers defect but the stitching on the thumb loop and velcro last me about 2 days with each of the 3 sets. So I could not recommend these to anyone.
2,Too short,Too short. have the rival ones that are full length and I like them better. Get what you pay for I guess
1,Falling apart after only a few uses!,"After only a few uses, already falling apart. Velcro tore off of one of the wraps. Very disappointed. There are much better wraps out there. I won't buy these wraps again."
5,About the cd,"I won't bother telling you how awesome they are because you already know that. Let's skip to the album's pro's: it comes with rarely ever heard of singles along with the originals, and it comes with timeless music videos that really bring you into the heart of there classics, and some funny sims music video. The only con it has is that they have amped up versions of ""something more"" and ""collapsed"" replacing the original versions. But once you get used to the changes they are great renditions and they din't change the actual songs, just added some extra notes in the background.A true collector's item!"
2,just like every other disney cd,i thought i would like this cd cause i heard ''no one'' on disney and thought it would be good so i got it and the cd stinks.there voices on whiney and aj repeats most of the time.they just remake lots of other peeps songs...just listen to it online dont waste ur $ on it.better than most disney stuff though(way better than hilary duff)
1,Aly and AJ? ... I dont think so!,"These people think that they're going to be the next big thing, but they arent. THey think they are disney protege's, but they arent. The one called Aly, the one from Phil of the future is so bad, she cant even sing, she sounds like pop trash, like lindsay lohan or hilary duff, who only try to play on their popularity from a dumb little children's show from disney. Aly is so ugly, she looks like an old woman, and the other one looks like a sluggish colon."
3,they aren't all that great,"I honestly find Aly and AJ and little annoying to listen to. Their music grates on me after only a few songs, and honestly they are not that talented. They have some talent i'll admit that, but the only some what good song they have is Rush and only the chorus is good."
