3,I bought this one because of a dream...,"One night I had a dream in which Andy Williams appeared. It was really bizarre. I was skiing down the side of a mountain with Eve Plumb and I suddenly fell down. I looked up and Eve was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, Andy Williams appeared.I asked him to help me up and he asked if I owned any of his albums. I said I didn't. He said he'd help me up if I promised to go and buy one of them. I promised I'd buy one, so he helped me up. Then he and I and Eve Plumb went to a diner and had hot chocolate together.It was such a weird dream. Usually other celebrities don't appear in my dreams about Eve Plumb. I figured it was some sort of sign, so I went and bought this CD the very next day."
4,You just don't hear these songs anymore......,Listening to Andy Williams brought back lots of memories. You just don't hear these songs played on free radio anymore. Now I can listen anytime I want. Great CD!
4,About as much Andy Williams as one needs,"Being a Sinatraphile, I don't often like to venture into the domain of other ""Easy Listening"" singers; I generally stick with the best. However, every now and then I pop in something different just for the sake of variety. If nothing else, it makes me appreciate Sinatra that much more. But I digress. Williams has a very smooth, pleasant voice. He's not offensive, his voice is distinctive, and he has sung some good songs. Besides, he was a friend and supporter of Bobby Kennedy, so he must be a halfway decent guy. This collection is pretty solid: his signature song, ""Moon River,"" is here; ""Can't Get Used to Losing You"" is a damn fine, catchy tune; ""Dear Heart"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses"" are also quite good, though my favorite song on this collection is the beautiful ""Emily."" There are some standards and a couple I could do without, but overall I would consider this a good buy."
5,16 Most Requested Songs,"Andy Williams 16 Most Requested Songs album is a great collection of his hits. I am happy to have found it at Amazon for my MP3 player. Now that Andy has passed away, I will cherish all he gave to us."
5,The album that made Farnham standout,"As an Australian I am proud to see a fellow Aussie singer attain stardom and John Farnham is well deserving of praise for in his music career he has achieved so much. I have had the opportunity to see him live in concert here in Sydney and was thunderstruck by the level of feeling and emotion he sung each song. He is a real star on the stage.Age of Reason, is my favourite album from John Farnham and I have been a avid listener and collector of his music from my teen years. Many of my favourite songs and well known songs are on this album release. The CD starts with an outstanding opening song called 'Age of Reason' (a song which should be heard by soldiers before they go fighting...maybe teach them the futility of war)and ends with 'When The War is Over'. The theme of this album is simply the futility of hate. Farnham puts his message across well and not in a political way like the Oils did.Great songs, great artist and perfect album."
1,"If You Are a Complete Idiot, This Book is For You","Believe the title! If you read BusinessWeek and have Internet access, this book is a waste of your time. While it defines the most basic terms of the Internet and investing (which you already know if you read the business section of your newspaper or a business magazine), it does not explain the more intricate methods of investing. The book is really a compendium of web sites. For example, instead of explaining HOW TO DO fundamental analysis, it tells you to go read a web site. Save your money. Search the web at www.dogpile.com with the term ""investing"" and get the same results free, in an instant."
2,Too much of a spoonfeed!,"OK, the book says it is for idiot's but come on, don't mean that literally! If you are a wee bit technical and understand the online world this book has a few chapters you can easily skip. Also, the author does not care to explain stuff like index funds, the various industry indexes, etc. The book has a load of good web links in it though. I wish the author had listed all the links at the end of the book in an appendix.You can live without this book. The same information is available for free online."
5,THE book to have for Chinese cooking.,"Having grown up in Shanghai, I consider myself fairly familiar with authentic Chinese food. I have used many different Chinese cookbooks both written in Chinese and English, and Yan-Kit's Classic Chinese Cookbook is by far the best. For anyone who is not familiar with the ingredients and methods unique to Chinese culture, the book's first few chapters provide a great introduction. I have tried maybe 1/3 of the recipes, and all of them lead to good results. I highly recommand this excellent book."
4,This book I recommend,"I lived in Singapore and Korea and loved the food, nothing like the US modified dished ordered in restaurants. I love the illustrations of the various oils, sauces and slicing and cutting procedures. I have made several recipes in this book and loved each one of them."
4,A Great Introduction to Chinese Cooking,"This delightful little book has sent me into Chinatown several times in search of the authentic ingredients required. The payoff has been delicious meals which seemed, to my Western palate at least, to be as authentic as you get. I haven't tackled any of the more daunting dishes--the various duck preparations, for example--but have found the various noodle, vegetable and chicken preparations to be tasty and not unduly difficult. A winner!"
4,Twenty year old cookbook,"Overall this is a very useful book, largely because of the excellent photographs. Be aware, however, that place names are in the conventional form, not Pinyin. The book was written in 1984; many excellent Chinese cookbooks are more recent and reflect the current market place and field investigations."
3,"Not as intrigued with this recipe book, as I am with my other Asian Cookbooks...",This one doesn't seem to hold my attention much....I can never seem to find a recipe that works for my family. I have another Asian cookbook that I always seem to turn to when cooking Asian.
4,Pictures and Careful Instructions are the best.....,"I love DK Eye Witness books, so I bought this one for my son, who is interested in learning how to cook as a professional chef. Being a visual person myself, I thought this would be a good addition to his growing reference library, as it contains all kinds of PHOTOS describing various types of noodles, spices, Chinese cooking instruments, procedures, etc. It is also very clearly written, and my son has informed me he thinks this is a wonderful book and would be extremely helpful for anyone trying to prepare different Chinese dishes."
4,"Soft, spotty, and huge.","This is a lovely stuffed toy. Its fur is gorgeous, and overall the jaguar is very soft. The only hard parts on it are the eyes. See the customer photos I uploaded for a pic showing the jaguar beside a 2-liter bottle for scale. It isn't as huge as the Aurora 'super flopsie' line, but it's a decent size for snuggling."
5,"Black Jaguar 30"" Stuffed Animal","I ordered this black jaguar, and I adore it. It is very cute, very soft, and very huggable. Younger children and cat lovers alike love this awesome big cat."
2,A Letdown for Hornblower Fans,"In ""Commodore Hornblower"", I think Forester's effort slipped. It seems to be slapped together without a real plot - a series of unexciting events with huge gaps, almost as if the author lost interest too. I loved the books in the series which portrayed Hornblower as a young, clever junior officer. In ""Commodore"", he shows little of the ""McGuyver-like"" ability to get out of a tight spot that I always enjoyed most. In fact, as a senior officer, HH doesn't even take part in most of the exciting parts of the book, but oversees them from his God-like perch above the battlefield or even worse, he hears the information second-hand from the mast head. This is the exact opposite of my favorite Hornblower book (""Lt. Hornblower""), in which the hero's exploits are related through the eyes of Bush."
4,Excellent. One of the most interesting of the series.,This is one of the most interesting of the series. Get to see Hornblower delivering another blow to Napoleon and his armies.
3,The slower part of the Hornblower series,"I'm glad I read through all the books, but overall I found the later parts of the story less engaging than the early Hornblower years. Good reading, however."
4,As the saga continues ...,"One would think that the stories can't get any better yet they do. You see/feel Hornblower changing, improving with age as fine wine. This book is a good read and gives a unique perspective on war in 1812 and politics that could be applied to more recent times."
1,Horrendous!,"This movie was definately one of the worst ""Zombie"" movies I have watched...Vampires at the beginning!!! What in the world?!?! Stay far far away!"
2,Great Acting,"The movie was just alright, but I found that there was good acting. The guy who plays Officer Paul Yates was really believable. If it wasn't for him, I would have turned the movie off long before the end."
1,war of the boring!! Don't waste your money! Makes no sense!,"Makes no sense corny, after 5 minutes you ready to throw DVD in trash!! Corny karate girls fight like so dum!!"
3,"A good resource, but it didn't live up to expectations.","nswers to a number of commonly asked questions a firefighter candidate may be asked during an oral interview. Each answer is then explained with a rationale of why the writer feels this is the best way to answer the question. The variety of questions will be very helpful in preparing a candidate to be prepared for anything the oral board may ask.My only concern is that there are a number of questions that involve very similar situations (moral issues, problem with a co-worker, etc.) and it seems that the author suggests noticeably different answers for each. This can be a bit confusing, as the author doesn't explain why the questions should be answered differently (although an explanation is provided for each individual answer).Overall, I'd say this is a good resource for anyone seriously pursuing a career in the fire service, if for no other reason than to see the number of different questions an oral board may ask you."
2,I would look around,I have not had several fire interviews. I have not been asked any of the questions that are covered on this CD
5,quick ship,"thank you, the book arrived quickly and in great condition. My son will be using this and I look forward to seen him succed w/ them."
5,Smoke Your Fire fighter Interview,"This book works like a charm. I went to my first interview with a fire dept. and did horrible on my interview. I placed 42 on that hire list. A friend told me about this book so I bought it. My very next interview, with a different dept, which was only a month after the first dept. I aced the interview and I am now #2 on thier list. This is a must have book."
1,Not an effective mouth piece,"I bought this for my wife hoping that she would stop her teeth grinding at night. After trying it the first night, she told me that the mouth piece feels like a hard piece of plastic in her mouth. It felt so uncomfortable that it caused her to drool on the pillows and in the morning she found it spit out on the bed.I purchased this following the great reviews of this product and am highly disappointed that this product DID NOT meet the expectations that the reviews gave me. If they are going to create a mouthpiece that feels natural to the mouth, they should make this with softer material. How is placing a LEGO block like this in your mouth supposed to help?? ridiculous product. don't be duped."
1,this was not what i expected,The advertisement didn't make it clear that you had to prepare it for use. This was a pain and then it didn't fit. I never used it.
4,Good Fit,"Like many other reviews, I found that the smaller size works better. It took me a good 3 or 4 days to get used to sleeping with this mouth guard but it no longer bothers me.I also tried the Grind Guard which initially had a better fit, but turned out not to be as comfortable."
4,Very good!,"I bought this product because I was under a lot of stress and started to grind my teeth at night while I was sleeping. Because I have a small mouth I chose the smaller of the two guards provided. I thought this product was extremely easy to mold (just remember to align the two front teeth with the indicated point on the front of the guard or else it might fit funny). At first it seemed too bulky and often feel out, but my mouth eventually got used to it and now it stays in all night. I highly recommend this product."
3,It's a Football mouthpiece,"It's just like wearing a football mouthpiece, so you'd be much better purchasing a $5 mouthguard at your local sporting goods store. I have not been able to wear it for the night."
3,OK but can't quite get it to stay in my mouth at night,"I bought this because my dentist said I had to stop clenching and grinding my teeth at night or I'd chew them to pieces. There are two guards: one large with a blue gel bite area, one plain clear plastic and smaller. You're supposed to set them in warm water then bite on them to make tooth impressions. Then you use whichever is more comfortable and throw the other away. Well, I tried both. When they work, they work (though you have to be rigorous about cleaning them, or yuck). But often I wake up in the morning and the thing is just swimming around in the sheets somewhere. The small one is small enough to slip out of my mouth, it seems, and the large one is just too large. I wish there was one you could just set on the back teeth instead of the front, since I don't clench my incisors and the trouble is closing my mouth over the front."
4,Works well,"This product works well and fits comfortably most of the time. The initial molding to your teeth is important for a comfortable fit, but if you don't get it perfect the first time you can re-heat and re-mold it."
1,Extremely thick,"I was really surprised at how thick both of these guards were. It would be impossible for me to sleep with either one in, and honestly I would be afraid they would cause more jaw damage than not using them at all. As I understand it (not saying I understand it correctly), the ones you are supposed to get for most jaw problems are actually very thin and hard. These feel just a shade off of being used for playing football. If you are having TMJ issues or teeth grinding issues I would continue searching for something else."
1,small one is too small large one is way too big!,"well i bought this one a few weeks ago hoping to find a mouth guard that fits my small mouth. unfortunately this product failed in my opinion. The ""small"" guard was sooooo small that it didn't even get to my back molars. The ""large"" guard was so large and thick that i couldn't close my mouth over it. Needless to say i went back to the ""Archtek Grind Guard"" pack again."
1,no no no,"both sizes that came with this were not good...the small size fell out of my mouth constantly ..the large size felt like it was meant for a horse's mouth it was so big,bulky and uncomfortable,"
1,piece of junk,"My husband has used mouth guards for years. No matter what we did with this one it would not stay in his mouth. Invoked warranty and returned to Amazon, we received email that return was received weeks ago, but still haven't received credit. Amazon now trying to figure out what happened. Just not worth the trouble, don't order"
2,Not great,"Both the guards were too narrow for my mouth. I am a 5'11', 150 lb. man that wears size medium, so not bigger than average.One guard was too bulky to be comfortable. Both were too stiff and narrow so it felt like they were pressing in on my teeth like braces might. I stopped wearing it because I was afraid it would move my teeth and I had slight pain in my teeth in the morning.I got a custom one from a dentist in Tijuana, Mexico for $100. It is excellent. ( My 83 year old mom got $2,500 worth of work done for $650.) Much like the whitening trays I got from my dentist a few years ago. Very thin and flexible. You hardly know you are wearing it.My bruxism started only two months ago. I am doing research to see about curing this problem as the night guard is only to minimize damage not to cure you."
1,Not Universal,"I gave this guard 1 star since it is not universal and there is an excessive amount of material making it way too thick. I was able to get it in my mouth but it made my lips protrude in an awkward, uncomfortable way. I bought this because of the positive reviews but neither size fit so I'm back where I started minus $20. I definitely would not recommend this to a friend."
4,Easy to use,"My dental hygienist recommended a sports mouth guard as an alternative to an expensive custom guard. I do not have dental insurance. She pointed out that I had already chipped off part of my front tooth. After reading all the conflicting reviews on night mouth guards, I was almost too overwhelmed to make a choice. Luckily using the actual product was the easiest part.I had no problems sizing the smaller guard to my mouth, and wear it overnight comfortably. I'm just holding back on the 5 stars until I check in with the dentist again."
1,Waste of money,"Wow, this was awful ! My mouth still hurts from trying to get this to fit. Maybe it works for other people, but it sure didn't work for me. (I have used other types and never had this problem, although those were softer and did eventually wear out). On the bright side, I did really enjoy finally throwing it away."
1,***TOXIC POISON***,"I bought this over a year ago for my severe tmj disorder. I could not use this for very long due to the fact of it tasting like chemicals. The chemical taste and smell was VERY strong!!! I tried many things to rid the toxic hunk of plastic, like, letting it soak over night in water, scrubbing with soap, scrubbing with tooth paste, ect. However, nothing worked to help aid in fumigating it, nor will anything. On top of literally gagging every morning I woke up after wearing this I was extremely nauseous! I plan on fixing my bite professionally and permanently."
1,No way to select color,"I would like to purchase this in a BRIGHT color. There is no way to select the color and I do not want black! I was unable to contact this seller. When I mouse clicked on ""contact seller"" button it just directed me to Amazon.com customer support and then required an order number. Without an order number I could not get past the customer support page! Very disappointing!"
2,Don't compare to Professional Dental Device,"I've had problems with grinding my teeth for decades. I used to have a professional mouth piece that a Dentist fit and ordered for me. It was great. I lost it a while back and since I don't have dental insurance anymore, I tried this. I ended up grinding my teeth into this one at night. It really doesn't compare to a professional piece."
1,Hockey Puck,"My dentist suggested I buy a mouth guardfrom him. I didn't want to pay $300, so Itried the Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit. Iwas able to mold it to my bite and it stayedin place. There is no way to regulatethe size of the gap between your upper andlower teeth. I couldn't get any sleep becauseit felt like I had a hockey puck in my mouth.I re-heated the guard and tried again and hadthe same result. I tried one other guardand didn't like it either. I finally bought theguard from the dentist, and it is great. Thedentist took molds of my teeth, determined thespacing between upper and lower teeth, and grindeddown the guard to make sure that all my lower teethhit it at the same time when I bit down. It'sno big deal to wear it. I get great sleep, andI don't even notice it until morning."
5,Works as it should,"I've only been using this for about 2 weeks but I am very satisfied with it so far. Two sizes are great - I use the smaller one and it fits perfectly. Very easy directions, took less than ten minutes from opening to getting a molded guard. The instructions are short but to the point. Be sure to follow the helpful hint about wearing it around before going to sleep. It takes some getting used to and the first few nights you may spit it out. Can't beat the price!"
1,Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard,"Hate it/them, total waste of money to me! Read the reviews from other purchasers and decided to give it a try. Large fit better but way to much bulkiness in my mouth, the small one felt better as far a not being quite as bulky but wouldn't stay in place. Okay...30 day money back guarantee; but after paying for 2 day delivery not sure it's going to be cost effective to return it. I went on line to [...] which is more costly but it is just like what your dentist would do only it is done on line direct with dental lab cutting out the middleman (Dentist) profits."
1,Home-made,"I was NOT happy to spend a small fortune for this item to discover it was home-made. It appeared that the items were purchased at Walmart, then bagged up with a home-made package insert to be passed off as a professional product. I was hoping for a thinner, more comfortable mouthguard. I returned mine, unused. I can get the identical items at Walmart for 97 cents each."
2,Dental Hygiene night guard,"I was very dissapointed in the product. You can get the gel hot enough and then sets okay, but really doesn't hold very well.. Very akward in the mouth, if you shave any down to fit better it really doesn't work. It was more uncomfortable to try to sleep with the guard in my mouth and so I ended up taking it out after about 2hours. Won't buy it again"
3,mouth guard,"Not sure whether I like this product or not. The instructions for molding the guard are good, but there seems to be one step missing. The guard fits well (the smaller of the two) while I'm standing, but my mouth must shift a little when laying down since it isn't as comfortable then. I will try again with a new guard and do the molding steps while laying down to see if that improves it. The main reason I won't be using this is that when I wake up in the morning, my teeth feel like they've been pushed out of place - not good. If adding that extra step fixes the problem, I may bump it up to 4 stars. If it also lasts a long time (>9 months) then I'll probably give it 5 stars."
2,way huge...,"Maybe it's because i've never gotten one fitted at the doc's, but this seems enormous to me? I don't have a small mouth i don't think, but this sticks out of my mouth like i'm going for a gorilla costume. incredibly uncomfortable, and i started drooling within a min of having it in...nevermind trying to sleep in it!so for those who never had one fitted at the doc's before and have no clue what to expect, know that this is pretty big even using the one that's meant for smaller mouth."
2,Buy if you like waking up several times at night.,"The mouthpiece is way to big. I went as far as using regular scissors like said in the instructions. Waking up several times at night because of discomfort is not for me. I originally bought this because there were some good reviews. Now you've heard it from the horse's mouth (no pun intended). Also, the 100% money back is flawed. It's Amazon's return policy which notes that the product must be ""unopened"". This isn't possible if you use the product for a couple weeks to test the ""comfort"" and then want to return it."
3,"Cheap, in both senses of the word","I bought this for my wife who has severe bruxism at night. Her insurance didn't cover the $400 for a professional guard that the dentist offered, so we looked at some cheaper options. First we tried a moldable mouth guard from the local sports store, but it created abrasions on her gums and was tossed after a few weeks. Next we tried this one -- after a few weeks of use, she has bitten right through it. In addition, the molding didn't go that well; don't bite down as hard as you can when you're doing it. Now that she's under different insurance, I think we're just going to get a professionally made guard this time."
4,Nice,"This product works farily well. It's better than the hard plastic mouth guards you can get in the atheletic store and the bigger night gaurd bought in Target. I have a small mouth, so the smaller size fits me better. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is that I had to play with it quite a few times to get it to fit my mouth. It's better than paying the expensive mouth guards that the dentist provides."
4,Protected Teeth,"I purchased this for my husband when he started to grind his teeth like crazy in his sleep. Compared to other similar products, this one is the best. I love that it comes with two to ensure the best/most comfortable fit. I'll also note that it was very easy to fit to his mouth.Another nice feature is that the red case stands out on the nightstand, which is a good reminder before bed that it needs to be put in. It does take awhile to get used to wearing the guard if you haven't worn one before, but that is probably the case with all night guards. There is still some tooth/jaw soreness in the morning, but it's great knowing that his teeth are still protected. There are no more horrid grinding sounds coming from his mouth anymore. The only reason for four stars instead of five is the price. However, this was worth buying, even if it is a tad more expensive than other night guards out there."
3,Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Night Mouth Guard Kit,These are ok. Not the best. My jaw was really sore after using this for a few nights. They seem really thin too.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. This product is nothing more than a simple mouth guard that you can get at any sporting goods store for $10 of less.Very bulky feel in the mouth. I struggled through 4 restless nights of sleep before I finally gave up on it. In the instructions it says that it may take 2 weeks to get used to the product, but I feel that is a little unreasonable. I am not convinced that I would be any happier with the product after two weeks of use."
4,magic,"I ordered this product because I have TMJ and for as long as I can remember have been having painful aching in my jaw and sometimes couldnt open my mouth in the morning. This often resulted in headaches. The mold is simple to cast and after only a few nights, I had no more pain. It seems to have permanently helped also. I stopped using it for a while (because having things in my mouth bothers me and the guard is pretty large) but the pain has not occurred since. Magic? I dont know, but I would definitely consider that another ""plus."" I would recommend this product for anybody who suffers from TMJ. For the price, why live with the pain?"
2,It didn't fit properly,"The fit is odd. I am a normal-sized woman with a normal-sized mouth. The large was too big and the small was too small (WAY too small). When I wear it at night, I can feel my teeth shift, and it's uncomfortable."
1,Once again let down by good Amazon reviews,This comes with two different sizes. One that's too big and one that's too small. If you happen to get a good fit consider yourself lucky. The big one I tried to trim down as much as possible but it was still way too bulky. The small one doesn't extend far enough back to cover my teeth. One thing you should be weary of is that these are so bulky that the material will extend far past your teeth onto your gums. This will cause your gums to recede over time. It also doesn't extend up into the roof of your mouth very well which results in a thick plastic edge which your tongue will use to push it out. Trimming the material didn't make much difference since it's basically too thick to wear. I guess everyone else had better luck than me.
3,mouth guard,"This mouth guard is better than any other drug store ones. BUT if the small size is the one for you, you can buy one a bit thinner that works really well in the sports section of walmart for 97 cents! It works great if thinner is what you are looking for."
3,Too bulky,"This was the first guard that I tried and I have since found that I preferDenTek Comfort Fit NightGuard. This product is pretty bulky (in either size) and the larger size was way too big. I've found the smaller DenTek quite a bit more comfortable and lasts considerably longer than this product. It's not bad, it's just not the best."
2,"Not comfortable, pushes out your lips","You would be better off spending the money to get a custom one fitted by your dentist. It will be a lot more comfortable and won't have all the excess plastic like this one does. It pushes out your lips and is not comfortable. I guess it's better than nothing but it's worth the $150-$200. to get a custom one from your dentist, especially if your dental insurance will cover it. Even if not, I would still perfer a custom one over this product.The custom one from my dentist is like night and day."
5,Perfect Fit,"This dental gaurd is the perfect fit. Much much better than the athletic mouth gaurd I was using. When I opened the package & saw the small clear dental gaurd, I thought there was no way that thing is even going to fit in my mouth. After heating & fitting the larger gaurd I thought I would give the smaller one a try as long as I already had the water heated. Well that little one is a perfect fit, I don't even really notice it in my mouth. The biggest problem with my old gaurd was I hardly wore it because it felt like I had a hockey puck in my mouth. This new one I have worn every night, it's perfect."
2,The dentist-made guard is very much superior,"I left my dentist-made mouthguard at a relative's home and would not get it back for a few months.So I purchased one of these. I use the guard on my upper teeth.The dentist-made guard turns out to be clearly superior in these ways:1. You can talk with a dentist-made guard in with fairly good clarity.2. You can drink or even take a pill with the dentist-made guard in.3. the dentist-made guard is more deeply seated and stays totally in place until you remove it in the morning.So this product was an adequate fill-in and of course it is cheaper, but it does not match up well against the dentist-made guard."
4,Helps with jaw pain,I was looking for something to help my 16 year old son who has been suffering with pain in his jaw which I believe is caused by the grinding and clenching of his teeth.He has been using it for 2 weeks and says it has helped to reduce the pain and discomfort he has been having in his mouth/jaw area.I can therefore add my recommendation of this product for these purposes.
4,Just what I needed for the price,Needed one when I sleep due to grinding my teeth. Didn't want to pay $300+ for custom made with dentist. Followed the directions and molded just fine to my teeth. Doesn't bother me when I sleep. Drooled just a lil bit depending on the position of my head. I would recommend this.
1,Worthless,"I had a bite guard from my dentist which I ground down to pieces. They are pretty pricey to replace (around $300) so I figured I should try a more economical replacement...a complete waste of my money. This item was bulky, uncomfortable and did nothing to help my night teeth grinding. If you are a serious teeth grinder, save your money and go to your dentist."
4,quick turn around,mouth guard came with two size. One large and one small. I have used them both and they seem to be helping. THank you
2,unhappy and disappointed,"It never fit well, the molding technique bent the edges of the device into my gums and hurt them. Not worth the money."
1,Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard,This product may work for some people but not for my wife. Both pieces are too thick she tried it and caused a sore in her mouth.
3,Better Than Nothing,"The small guard is pretty much useless after it warped and shrunk.The large guard works better than nothing, but I hope to quit using it once my professional guard comes in. The large guard is rather bulky too."
2,really bad,"Assembly is a nightmare! Maybe we just got a bad one, but holes were mis-drilled so things wouldn't line up. We ended up just throwing away the top shelf because there was no way it would line up. I'm no newbie to assembling furniture from a box either - Ikea is my middle name. This was my first failure. Do yourself a favor and find another desk."
3,So So,"The cover feels really nice in the hand and its sturdy, but the biggest drawback is the opening where you put the charger. You can't really fit the USB adapter into the slot with the cover on without a fight."
1,terrible mix,"am from southeast TX and love ettoufee but cant find any mix here in FL so i got this online.. dont waste ur $$.. this is the most bland, flavorless stuff out there... try a diff brand.. this stuff is a waste"
2,Kidding yourselves.,"If you really want a clue about the only effective and sustainable way to deal with customers, by just talking to them, read ""The Cluetrain Manifesto."" Folks are getting too sharp (thank goodness) for any other marketing ""strategy"" to work."
1,Repackaged Database Marketing,"The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading. If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book. If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here. In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole. The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet. The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them."
3,So What Else is New,"I was looking for a book that would guide me through the maze of CRM but instead I got alot of examples of marketing under the guise of CRM. It wasn't focused enough into this exciting field. The .com was to entice readers, but there really wasn't much new."
5,What an eye-opener!,"Wow. This book really shook some of my assumptions and prejudices about CRM. I've been consulting for businesses about how to build market share and brand value for sixteen years, but I feel as if I've only just learned how loyalty actually works. I don't think anyone can claim to understand customer relationships until they've read this book. Plus it's clearly, succinctly and memorably written. A real gem, and a must-have for everyone in marketing."
1,BALL SLICER,"This gun is a major ball slicer, and is not even accurate to start with!!! It also can not even come close to working in bad weather...DO NOT GET THIS GUN! Get the Spyder Sonix, Spyder TL-R, or Tippmann A-5 instead.(I'm still waiting for it to blow up...)"
5,very helpful,The stories from those caregivers who have lived in the trenches is most helpful and provide information in dealing with it. Very good
5,Breathtaking book - a Must Read!,"David Karp promises no easy answers, but he is unquestionably our most eloquent chronicler of mental illness. I had to take a lot of deep breaths as I read this book. It is full of gripping stories about the daily crises and terrible contradictions faced by anyone living with a mentally ill family member. The book moves between personal narratives and cultural analysis to explore what we owe the people we love. If you are a caregiver, or simply a reader who is puzzling through the question of commitment and moral obligation in your own relationships, you simply must buy and read this book."
5,an amazing book,This is the first book I've read that describes my experiences of living with mentally ill family members so precisely. It is a must read for anyone living with or caring for a mentally ill loved one. David Karp has tapped into a secret well of pain and love and compassion that needs to be brought to the collective consciousness of our society.
3,Dredging up Memories,"This is a large format (8.5 by 11?) paperback printed on cheap paper, as Frank needed to keep costs down. I believe Frank printed an original 1000 copies, advertised them in TV Guide, and sold some. It's an enjoyable book of lists to pore over, as Frank used a lot of math in trying to determine the biggest hits - also factors like population, disposable income, etc. So it's interesting. Frank was threatened by letter by the lawyer of whoever it was owned the rights to publish Billboard's data, and had to agree not to print any more copies. They agreed to let him sell his thousand. I have a copy somewhere - maybe in a box in the basement."
4,Higher Ground,"Good Spiritual Music, Barbra at her best. I play this when I'm in a funk and it makes me feel better."
3,"Barbara Strisand, Higher Ground","I love this singer, and yet this is not her best work, and it is not the best mix of song selections."
5,Barbra Has Stood the Test of Time,"My father loves Barbra Streisand, and he has heard portions of this album on a TV station he enjoys. He always wondered if this was available on CD. I told him if he could remember a few of the song titles, I would look for him. I searched here on Amazon, and found this wonderful CD. I must say he absolutely loves it, and pretty much plays it everyday. There is no bum song on this CD, and we both agreed that it is truly an inspirational collection that makes you think about life and your purpose. Highly recommended!"
2,"Dreary, dull, dreadful!","This one should have been titled ""Lower Ground"". It is the most boring cd I've ever listened to. The one good song, ""Tell Him"" can be found on Celine Dion's cd, which is much better than this dreck."
1,Boring and Bland and Bloated...,"The voice is great and the songs are generally well written (""Tell Him"" is awful, however.) What went wrong? I am still waiting for a recorded song of hers to match ""For All We Know"" from Prince of Tides. Everyone is entitled to a dud. It is time to move on."
2,"Barbra, you are the hot air beneath my wings . . .","As a long, long time Streisand fan (I can lay claim to having bought her first album when it came out in '62 or '63), I feel qualified to say (as unpopular as this position is) that this is one of her lesser accomplishments. Over produced (as all her albums are of late) and with a collection of material that runs from the sublime to the silly (the Celine Dion duet comes to mind) and is heavily weighted towards the unmemorable, the only thing it inspired me to do was to get out the earlier, simpler, more exciting albums. As one critic said of this album, if you're going to sing inspirational music, at least sound inspired."
2,It's Barbara. What do you expect?,"As a student of music, and particularly of the female voice, I own a wide range of music that I study, simply to understand the appeal of various styles and sounds. This is one that was recommended, and I bought it (cheap & used, thank God) to study.Personally, Barbara's voice drives me up the wall. Her forced, unnatural vibrato that is produced in the back of her throat, her melodramatic emphasis of every stinking line, and her miserable attempt at Sinatra-esque phrasing (hesitating a moment before coming in on the phrase). She has some of the most predictable phrasing and ornaments ever known to womankind.I actually love several of these songs, including ""On Holy Ground"", and I am annoyed that she tried to recreate this track. Barbara, only the ""alternative"" lifestyles like you! And those who like fake, contrived emotions.YUCK! She only avoided a ""1"" because she has somehow managed to make a name for herself, and that deserves some credit."
3,Merciful Heavens! What is the deal with Barbara Streisand?,"The songs on this album are great--except for the fact that Barbara is singing them.She sings through her nose, which I do not find to be a talent but rather a hindrance. If you want to hear great songs sung by people with great voices, listen to Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman. Barbara has a very few number of songs that actually sound good.But if you like a nasaly voice, you will love this CD."
2,Boring...not one of my favorites.,"I'm sorry, and no offense to ""that voice,"" but Barbra Streisand is not one of my favorite singers. I was disillusioned into getting ""A Love Like Ours"" because Andrea Bocelli sang with her (that's what my mother told me), but he didn't. On this album, most of the songs are just plain slow and boring. Sorry again, folks!"
1,Mystical claptrap sprinkled with inspirational sentiments,"This album has got to be the worst album I have ever heard from Barbra Streisand. There are no popular tunes here, nothing worth noting, and the entire album is completely forgettable like yesterday's rag sheets. The song Higher Ground, is especially offensive to atheists and other intelligent and rational people, who are smart enough not to believe its mystically-oriented, subjectivist, presumptuous mediocrity. One line in the song goes ""we are standing on holy ground..."" Oh really? It's a shame that an artist of Barbra's caliber should sing such nonsense. When it comes to material, she simply cannot or will not choose better songs. Too bad!"
5,"Fantastic, a pleasure to listen to All The Songs.....",I found this album to be Inspirational and Relaxing...as always and as usual I am never disappointed in any song or album that Barbra has made..I am an ardent fan of hers and enjoy everything she does...she is indeed a Super Star in every sense of the word...and a Class Act.
4,loved the album play it regularly,"Would like to know where you can get backtracks to these songs. Enjoy singing them immensely, very inspirational."
5,"Gentle,moving and just great Barbra","I ordered the CD for the last track, but boy was I ever thrilled when I listened to all of it. Her voice and choice of songs was suberb.I never get tired of listening to it. ""If I Could"" made me cry and ""On Holy Ground"" sent shivers down my spine. BRAVO BARBRA"
5,Excellent--Jane in society,"I liked this addition to this series of books very much. This is probably the most ""social"" of these books--Jane is very much part of the larger society of Bath (which constrains and enervates her.) The development of Jane's relationship with Sir Harold and his family is central to this novel, and for really the only time in this series there are some visible stresses between Jane's independence and her family's concern for how things look."
3,Interesting Information About Theatre,"This book was just as slow and ponderous as the first too, but had alot of interesting information about Regency era theatre. Still not very witty, either."
4,A new addiction for me,"I love Regency and Victorian mystery series, and I thought I'd read most of the ones of any note, and then I discovered the Jane Austin Mystery series. I was extremely happy to find another series with well-drawn Regency characters and wonderful plotting. The idea of Jane Austen as sleuth is not that far-fetched since she was such an intelligent woman. Ms. Barron does a fine job of imitating Miss Austen's writing style, and she captures her personality very well. This is the third book in the series. It is set around Christmas time 1804, and is set in Bath where Miss Austen lived for a few years after her father left the ministry. There are plenty of wonderful period details and snippets of information in the footnotes that bring this period to life. Jane is involved with Lord Harold again as they try to track a murderer. The murder occurs at a masquerade ball in the Lord Harold's aunt's house. Delicious!"
3,"Jane Austen, NOT! But a fun read.","Once I decided that this was an alternate universe -type of Jane Austen, I found the book fun and interesting. Bath and the time period colorfully portrayed. While the profusion of footnotes were interesting I would rather they had been collected in the back of the book or incorporated into the text -- the footnotes seemed to imply a scholarlyness that was out of step with the murder mystery.It's a quick read with a few novel twists and turns -- enough to keep it interesting. I'd read a second book by the same author but it doesn't have the insightfulness off-handed look at her society that I so enjoy in Jane Austen's books."
5,THIRD JANE AUSTEN MYSTERY BEST SO FAR!!!,"""Jane and the Wandering Eye"" by Stephanie Barron is a book worthy of the highest praise. It's devious fiendishly clever, keeping the reader on their toes until the final, surprising ending. A sign of a good mystery is the element of surprise, yet total plausibility in the ending, and ""The Wandering Eye"" delivers with great panache. This mystery is well written and should please Jane Austen and mystery affecianatos alike. A very, very, very enthusiastic five stars!!"
4,"Worth it for Yankees fans, but picture really annoying","As mentioned, the picture in almost every game chops out the bottom part of the on-screen graphics. It is rather frustrating. Game Six of the World Series and Game Five of the ALCS are the best as far as seeing the graphics. Unfortunately, the video quality isn't very good for Game Six and the ALCS game is missing parts of the game. It isn't missing much, but enough so you'll notice. Also, the audio fluctuates during games. Keith Jackson, Tom Seaver, and Howard Cosell handle announcing duties during ABC's broadcast of the World Series. As a nice touch, A&E and MLB Productions placed the local Yankees telecast of the ALCS game on this set. The announcing for that game is handled by Bill White, Frank Messer, and the one and only Phil Rizzuto. Bottom line, this DVD set is a worthy purchase, but you might not want to pay full price."
3,"Great History, Rotten Video","This review is based on having viewed Disk One of the set. The DVD starts with a disclaimer saying the quality will not be good but the best available masters have been used. What that means is the bottom of the image is cut off (often making the last line of the player's stats unreadable) and the image is shifted down slightly, leaving a slight black bar at the top of the screen. Yes, my TV is adjusted properly. The MLB logo has also been watermarked into the top right of the image, but that was to be expected after viewing previous MLB releases. The video is fairly grainy, but even more troubling is the complete loss of sound for nearly a minute during the middle of the game. Other notes: This is the ABC broadcast with Howard Cosell and Tom Seaver doing the play-by-play, but without the bumpers, pre-game etc. Bottom line: Definitely worth watching for historical reasons, but you may want to rent before buying."
3,Intentional Customer Dissatisfaction (i.e. for suckers),"Of course they produced it in Widescreen. You know why. Because, this way, all the die hard Yankee fans who went out and bought this thing, will buy it twice when they re-release it in Full Screen. They know exactly what they are doing."
5,Amazing Overview of Spiritual Journey,"This is an amazing book. First time I read it about four years ago, I kind of liked it but didn't understand most of it. I picked it up again last month, and it's become the most important book in my life. It's the best overview of the spiritual journey that I've run into in many years, using the Mayans' mathematics as a guideline to another realm of being. It also makes the point that all powerful world traditions, including those of the Native Americans, can lead to the truth. Be patient, read it slowly, and this book will speak to you."
1,Warning: This book may not be what you think it is!,"Interested in ancient civilizations? Or why the Mayans used large numbers that are normally associated with astrophysics?If yes to either of these, DON'T buy this book. Quite simply put, this book is about some hippy-type on a spiritual quest, and not a study into the ancients listed in the book's title.If you've seen the Simpsons episode where Homer attends the local chilli-cook-off, then ends up having to search out his soul mate, you'll already have a pretty good idea about the contents of this book. I jest not!However, if you spend time on the other side of one of Huxley's doors, you may just get through the book without experiencing the nausea associated with the realisation that you've just wasted a portion of your hard earned."
5,Another great CD!,"Another Great CD by Selah, I think this one is my favorite by far. Love the spin on old hymns =)"
4,Selah...Selah...Selah...,"This CD has some really good songs on it. I defiantly recommend it. It?s not my favorite Selah albums (probably my least fav actually) but it is still great with some great songs (Bless Your Name, Deep Deep Love of Jesus, Hiding Place). I can't stand 'By and By' and 'Power in the Blood'(what is UP with those nasty background vocals?!). This CD is a little more contemporary, not that that's bad, but I like Selah with minimal music and maximum voices."
5,The best Christian CD,I truly have enjoyed every song in this CD. The songs are truly inspiring. The talent of this group is incredible and look forward to their next CD.
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This cd is as usual for Selah great! The first selection, You lift me up is one I listen to over & over again. I own all of their cd's. All of their music is good! Highly reccomended!"
4,Excellent Classic,This was a DVD i used to watch as a kid and even my two year old daughter loves this.excellent classical DVD to own
4,A CRITICAL REVIEW OF A MARINE RECON COMPANY,"A WELL WRITTEN BOOK. PROVIDES GREAT INSIGHT AS TO THE PROBLEMS OF COMMAND WITH A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MARINE UNIT. LEE SERVED WITH MAJOR DOC NORTON, WHO HAS WRITTEN FOUR BOOKS ON SIMILAR SUBJECTS. THEY ARE BOTH FINE WRITTERS. A GOOD HISTORY FOR VIETNAM READERS."
3,It's fine.,"I like the price of this shoulder pad, and it does it's job, but I can't rave on about it like the previous reviewer. It is pliable enough. I wish it were more cloth-like. I got it b/c my seat belt cuts into my neck when I wear shirts w/ lower necklines. That problem is fixed, but the pad is sticky like vinyl is against warm skin. That's annoying.UPDATE: After ~ 1 yr of using it, it has cracked and fallen apart so much that it is way more uncomfortable to use it than not. I held onto it to cover it with cotton cloth, but don't know if I'll ever get around to it."
5,Very Nice,"Liked the wig a lot, wasn't really cheap and crappy. Was even in a hair net inside the bag, you can tell it was taken care of. I was able to wear it, put it away, wear it again, and not have it fall apart on me. I would recommend it."
2,Confusing and Incorrect,"I puchased this book, in addition to many other telecom books and found this to be one of the worst ones. Not only is the information useless it is written in a diffucult to understand fashion. I recommend that you do not waste corporate money of this book."
3,DSL?,"This book has alot of excellent information, However...., it claims in the description to cover DSL. It appears once in the book in one sentence..... This refers to the signature edition"
3,Out of date,"Since this is the Third Edition and the copyright is 2000, I expected this book to be more up-to-date. It barely touches on any LAN speed faster than 100M. I thought it interesting that the author considers Frame Relay to be ""new and is just now becoming an acceptable means of transporting information"". As far as I know, Frame Relay has been around for several years and the use is far spread. It also talks about Cascade Communications, which changed to Ascend Communication in 1997, which in turn was acquired by Lucent in 1999. It also still references US West instead of Qwest. The authors tend to repeat information in the voice section. I would like to have seen more detail on the Data side of communications. The book is a good basic starting point for learning Voice and Data Communications, but leaves too much out to be a good reference book."
1,Worst College Book of all time,"Ok well it may not be the worst book that I have used for college but it is on my top 5 list. I hate this book!!! The chapters are long. It uses to many acronyms. I hate having to go to a previous chapter just to find out what IEC stands for. But the worst thing of all is the chapter questions. You really have to search for the answer. The questions do not go in order with the chapter making it a very time consuming task to answer the questions (especially when you have 10 other chapters to complete in one day). Come on make it easier on us college students, we have enough to do already. I guess this book could be alot worse but it also could be alot better. Its very hard to stay awake when reading this book."
5,There's nothing perfect in this world,"I think so far, this is the most complete book ever. This book covers a thorough explaination for (almost) every telecommunication issue. Althogh maybe the book does not explain every updated issue or every topic in deep, I think this book is still the best (hey, there's nothing perfect in this world!). I think the author more concerned on a complete basic understanding rather than a thorough explaination in ""every-every"" topic. This book is, I think, perfect for every beginner and comfortable for every experiences.Also, I think the author likes jokes and fun. This makes the book more interesting to read. From the book dimension, the price, and also the contents; this book is a ""real deal"" for everybody in telecommunication industry."
1,"Boring, full of redundant silly and unrealistic examples!!","This was simply a waste of 65.0 plus tax. The book is so boring that I could not even read materials I was so eager to know about. In trying to explain concepts, the authors resort to one of the most boring approaches I have ever encountered. Is there a way to get my money back ?!!"
2,Needs editing,"Good dry military history. Crowl is as readable as any in the US Army history series.However, this looks like it was auto scanned and some of the double column original pages have gotten mixed into one page, with all the short sentences jumbled.Luckily the original scanned pages are included so you can figure out what is written.In short, writing good, this kindle version scanned with errors. Please spend 15 minutes to proof and correct! I did cost money."
4,How cute is this???!!!!,Poofie is soooo cute!!!!No girl could resist her cute little face even though it may be coverd with her fur.Thats why they call her poofie i guess.She is a wonderful toy and i think any puppy loving girl should buy her.Poofie looks just like a real shih-tzu puppy.One of the cutest beanie babys ever in my point of view.
2,I dont know why i read this since i hated the first one so much,I dont understand....whos the daughter of the shaman? I read the whole book and there is no shaman with a daughter.
2,"cute shoe, hard to wear","This shoe is great in theory but it's nearly impossible for me to wear. I can't seem to balance my weight on the teensy heel and my toes go poking through the little straps. As I have previously stated, the ankle straps make this shoe a lot more wearable."
2,Cute but too long and pointy,"They looked cute on the web, great heel and strap, but the front of the shoe is too long and pointy. The straps at the front show the toes with about an inch in front of them left of shoe. So they look too big even though the size of the shoe was correct."
1,Better to look for a used one,"I bought a new Brother cassette daisy wheel number 411 Brougham. With very light usage, the letter ""u"" partially broke off. I am going to look for a used daisy wheel. New ones are too expensive and mine did not last long."
1,"Short-lived, but there don't seem to be other options","The original daisy wheel lasted nearly 8 years in light office use (typing a few labels and envelopes from time to time). The last 2 daisy wheels I purchased lasted less than a year each -- but what other options do you have, short of buying a different (brand) typewriter?"
1,Don't last but there isn't another option,My mother uses her Brother typewriter to write letters - no email for her. The last one of these developed broken letters after 3 months and the previous one didn't last much longer. Definitely not a quality product now that there isn't any competition or much demand.
5,Brother Daisy Wheel,"When my word processor went crazy, I knew my daisy wheel was to blame. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Amazon could quickly supply me with a replacement wheel - and a ""brand new"" one at that. Amazon really saved my day."
4,Good for fun,"This is a great disc. It is professional disc and not easy to throw for a beginner. Although, after a few weeks my 10 year old daughter was throwing like an expert! Worth the money if your somewhat serious about getting good at throwing a disc."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"The performers in this movie are wonderful. It is so refreshing to see young, mostly unknown actors and actresses, do work of such a high caliber that gives this movie a life of it's own. Even without the stellar musical performances, each one of these thespians brings something to their character that make him or her stand out. As for the musical perfomances; well they elevate this movie to a rock and roll ""must see"". To bring such vitality and sincerity to music that was made before most of them were born, well that's like a breath of fresh air to an old rock and roller like me. Is this movie worth owning and treasuring? Well as the Commitments' manager would say; ""ABSOLUTELY! NO QUESTION!!"". P.S. The ""Treat Her Right"" music video, that comes as a extra on this DVD, is icing on a perfect cake."
3,Wasted Effort on DVD,"The excellent reproduction qualities offered by the DVD format, and the magic of an otherwise excellent, wonderful film, are lost in this unfortunate waste of time and money. Why bother with a DVD without widescreen and 5 channel stereo? This DVD is very disappointing."
2,Great Movie - Very poor disc,"I just bought this movie for my Wife for xmas, being one of her favorites, we were looking forward to watching it, however, the disc itself is severly lacking in quality.1. No Widescreen? Criminal on a new DVD these days.2. No Digital 5.1 surround sound? Musicals are a must for the digital treatment.3. Extra's? Very basic behind the scenes stuff, nothing spectacular.So much could have been done with this excellent film, but unfortunately it hasnt, buy it if you love the film, but dont expect all the extra's, or you will be sorely disapointed."
4,What a fun movie,"The Commitments is a unique film. Based on a Roddy Doyle novel, the characters performed most of the music for the movie. The vision is to bring soul to the lower and middle classes in Dublin. A group of misfits is assembled and polished into a surprisingly talented band.This really was a fun movie. I liked it a lot. The music was great, the story moved along well, the ending was just how I could have imagined it. I think you'll like it."
5,top notch,"excellent movie for people that appreciate music, or for young folks that play music or are thinking about playing an instrument or starting a band. Hilarous."
1,The Commitments,"I cannot play this movie on anything but a computer. It is a bust. It is from another ""region."" Very disappointed"
1,Um ... doesn't work!,DVD made in Europe ... doesn't work in North America. Receive error message when try to play but I think it would be dubbed in Italian anyway.CommitmentsLesson learned.
5,commitments-excellent,the movie was in excellent condition and I am very pleased and satisfied with my order. Thank youDansie Scoggan
4,ball's out movie. . . with punch!,"Nothing like a situation movie that let's you enjoy the movie and music! Basically a street level language flick from England with a soul sound from the states.Story wraps around a group of loose indivuals that decided to start a rock and roll band using the ""Black soul"" sound to make their mark. Along the way they jell,and get better and better to the point where they actually have a chance to make the big time.Of course money, sex and no leadership allows the band to become a walking bomb. As all good stories go, this one falls apart, when all is going well....both musically & melting all musicans in the band together.Great young sounds and interested insight to the youth of Great Britian."
1,My purchase,The movie took over a month to arrive and when I emailed amazon and the vendor to complain they said that all they new is that the movie was in the mail. I will say that it was being shipped to an APO address which makes it harder to track.
3,Great film- sound is very disappointing,"This is one of the great films of the 90's. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the sound quality. Dolby surround but it sounds muddy and out of synch. Is anybody else disappointed> Alan Parker never should have let this out in ""pan and scan""- Please."
1,No fair warning.,"This won't play on a regular DVD player, You would need a high-end all-in-one player that could handle this pressing."
4,"BEWARE, PAN-SCAN!!!","Oh my god, i so love this movie, and both soundtracks.. this is a definate classic, and im totaly disapointed that this is only pan-scan, not widescreen. so be warned, there will be another release some time, and its a waste of money to buy it twice, so im holding out till its in widescreen.the cast is very loveable, and the story and music flow very nice. but its not for kiddies, the f word is used about 500 times in this movie... but on the other hand there is no nudity and very little violence (one fight, as i remember) so if you can handle the f-n-heimer its worth it.. you will be singing mustang sally by the time the movie is over...4 stars for the movie, (5 stars if it was in widescreen)"
1,"Love the movie, but why a full-screen aspect ratio?","Now, I adore this movie. But I've always kept away from the DVD because they simply didn't have a widescreen version. I would gladly buy this DVD if the studio cared more."
2,"Should Be Called ""The Committed""","When the 'band' is performing, THE COMMITMENTS is excellent. However, in the final analyisis, the backstage squables among the band members overtakes the story and it becomes more of a nuisance than a story conflict device. The characters are well drawn out, the Dublin location shots are atmospheric, and the music and musical performances are all great. Yet,there seemed to be some fight (some of which were very physical, bloody, and abusive) or disagreement among the band members after each of the performances and it became too much of a distraction to enjoy the whole film. In some cases, it made some of the characters/band members come off as people who should be in an insane asylum. Overall, the film gets 2 stars because the fighting amongst the band members backstage overshadowed the great music that was performed onstage."
4,DVD: Disappointing Video Disk,"""The Commitments"" is an exceptional movie that holds up very well through repeated viewings. It is exactly the kind of film you would want to own in your DVD collection, because you could enjoy it for many years. That's why I was very disappointed that the DVD version is available only as pan and scan (1.33:1 aspect ratio). This is the equivalent of taking a 5-channel audio theatrical release and making a DVD that's available only in mono sound.As much as I like this film, I will not buy a DVD that has been degraded from the original theatrical release. Apparently the film companies don't yet understand what motivates buyers to pay extra for DVD quality and home theater systems. I hope that ""The Commitments"" will be available soon as a re-released DVD in its original 1.85:1 widescreen theatrical version."
1,WARNING! NOT LETTERBOX!,"GREAT FILM! One of my favorites. BUT, despite the fact that it's advertised as being presented in ""Widescreen"" it is not! Unfortunately this DVD is a PAN and SCAN version - VERY DISAPPOINTING! Come on FOX get with the program, these are DVD's not VHS! The film gets ""5"" stars, the Pan n' Scan video gets ""1"". =("
1,Mistake,I guess I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this dvd - it was shipped from Italy and was in Italian. Duh! Feel like an idiot! Would have preferred The Commitments in English for sure!
1,Defective product.,"The DVD did NOT work. When the play button was pressed, only a Region Error message appeared & no move play."
3,Good if you're bored,"This is not the best book to read, but if you're bored and nothing else to do, then it's enough to keep you entertained. It's light and pretty much a chick flick."
3,Eh.,"If you like girly, estrogen-filled books. This is the one for you. Mates, Dates and Designer Divas is the first book of the Mates, Dates series that I've read. It was about Nesta, who is a ego centric drama queen, who has to cut back on money because both of her parents are temporarily unemployed. Nesta meets a boy and they become boyfriend and girlfriend. The rest of the book is basically about Nesta dealing with peer pressure, a little bit of gambling (sorry. spoiler there), and her new boyfriend's peers."
3,I discovered something reading this ...,"I really, really DO NOT like Nesta. She is such a drama queen. Her friends always have to being praising her - ""Nesta, you're so beautiful""; ""Nesta, you are so pretty;"" ""Nesta, you are so fashionable"" - for her to be happy. She is damned annoying and whiny and must always be the center of attention. I like Lucy and Izzy and TJ so much better. Nesta is a brat. Save your money and don't buy the Nesta books like this and ""Sequin Smiles""."
5,Great kids CD,"My 2 year old can't get enough of this CD! We end up playing it all the time and I don't find myself losing my mind as a result-- there are not many children's CDs that can be said about. Great CD, highly recommend it!"
2,Not That Impressive,"Not much on the blitzkrieg, much more on pre-WWII German history leading upto the blitz. A lot of pictures of Hitler, going by the title I thought I would be getting a lot more about Poland and Norway/Denmark. Still, a good basic book, with a few very interesting pictures of the campaigns."
3,A rose is a rose is a rose,"With all due respect....I adore Deborah Madison and have all her cookbooks....this can, indeed, be tofu. Unless you're blending it into a chocolate mousse, it's still tofu. Same weird texture. Same bland taste. Same ""WTF!"" reaction when I try to serve it to anyone else. Deborah is a great cook, but even great cooks can't make tofu into something it's not."
3,ok,"bought this book to cook food for my son with allergies...but many of the recipes were more 'adult/fancy' oriented...still basic, but not really kids taste...at least mine. many of the recipes also used egg/milk which we have to avoid... I guess I was thinking Tofu and vegan at the same time... this book uses Tofu, but it is not full of vegan recipes."
4,Good book if you like Tofu,I bought the book so I can try tofu in different ways. I still am not a fan of the texture of Tofu. The silken Recipes are great. I recommend it to people who like Tofu.
3,What does it look like?,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend that recently decided to become vegetarian. I am unfamiliar with tofu and tofu cooking, as is she, so I thought it might be helpful to have a cookbook with tasty meatless recipes. Mind you, I haven't tried any of the recipes in this book, they may be delicious, but what I found disapointing is THERE ARE NO PICTURES (except for the three on the cover.) I hope the recipes in this book taste more appealing than the book is to look at."
3,Non-Veggie Ingredients,"I need to start by stating I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK.That said, I wanted to point out the many instances in the reviews here of non vegetariant ingredients, including references to fish sauce and worcestershire sauce. I will not be purchasing this book because of those concerns. I just want to make sure others notice that."
3,gotta have the crunch,"Okay, so I am not a strict vegetarian. But I really do want to like tofu. I dream about the crunchy sesame tofu I order at my local chinese restaurant, but have NEVER liked a tofu dish that I made. This is frustrating since I cook every night, and yet can't stop craving the damn sesame tofu at Orient Garden. I really like Deborah's book _Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone_ and the new _Local Flavors_, but I need the crunch and I can't find it here. Help me! Suggestions--I don't want to buy the pre-deep fried tofu at the Asian market."
3,Decent book but not very inspiring,"Being new to tofu, I was hoping for a book that would inspire me with things I could make easily. The recipes seem ""ok"" but would have been more helpful with some photos or something visual to go by. I like recipe books that have pictures so I can say ""ohh ok I get it"". This book has zero pictures and although I tried my best to picture the foods in my head, I just couldn't pull it off. Hopefully I can find something more suited to me. Back to square one."
4,An excellent introduction to tofu - even for veterans,"I bought this book for my stepfather when he asked me what to do with tofu. I liked it so well I then bought one for myself. The recipes are innovative and extremely tasty. Friends and family members who would ordinarily turn up their noses at tofu gobble down these recipes, no problem. The only down side to ""This Can't Be Tofu"" is that the author is overly fond of frying. However, those recipes which call for frying can be easily modified."
2,Not what I had hoped.....,"I was pretty excited to get this book, but when it arrived, I was a bit let down. A lot of the recipes are REALLY similar, so not much variety; a lot of them are deep fried. No desserts are listed, what a shame. All in all, old school and pretty darned boring.....I shall have to look elsewhere for tofu inspiration!"
5,Wonderful Tofu Cook Book !!!!,"If you are a first timer to Tofu.. this is the book for you!!! The recipes are easy & good tasting too. The introduction gives you an understanding of what Tofu is all about.... how it's made & what to do with ""that funny health food stuff"".I would recommend it to ALL"
2,Disapointing,"I don't know what it is about this book that I don't like. I love tofu. Maybe it's the lay out or maybe none of the recipies appealed to me. After reading all the positive reviews I may go back to it, however I agree with the reviewer who suggested checking it out in a book store before you buy it. I wish I had."
1,75 recipes and nothing to cook!,"I really wanted to like this book - I love tofu! - but, unfortunately, 80-odd pages of recipes yielded very little in terms of things I would actually want to try. This might be a good book for you but I would urge you to flip though it at a book store before buying."
3,Warning!! Alan Rodgers Books/Aegyptian Press Edition has NO MAPS,"Warning!! The Edition of this book published by Alan Rodgers Books/Aegyptian Press has NO MAPS!!! I strongly recommend that you do not buy that edition. I am sure sorry I did. I wish I could recommend an edition that I know does have maps, but from the information available on their web pages I can't tell if they do or not. I just went and took a look on the web and the original edition had 6 maps. Churchill obviously assumed in the text that maps were going to be available to refer to. It is VERY DIFFICULT to figure out what was going on during the campaign without them."
5,The best book in the baby sitter club serious!!!!,This book was one of the best books in the baby sitter club serious and you know there were a LOT! This book really got deep in to Staceys feelings about having deiabets and her strugles with that.Also the whole club is faced with a problem...some one else has started there own baby sitters club!!!!!!!Now this wouldn't be so bad if that club wasn't getting more people calling them....and then when that club pays a trick on them the baby sitters club knows the other club HAS to go!!!
3,AMM didn't do her research,"Although I enjoy all of the books in the BSC series for their entertainment value, as someone who was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes (like Stacey) at the age of 7, I have to say that Ann M Martin's portrayl of/research on the subject of diabetes leaves a lot to be desired. I was living with the disease at the same time as this book was written and even then the information she presents was outdated, over-generalized and in some cases just blatantly wrong. Read the book because its fun, don't base your knowledge of diabetes on it."
3,Take a Pass,"After hearing the author speak on the radio, I decided to check out one of his books. It turned out to be a bunch of aphorisms and disjointed statements in the same vain as Nietzche's book, Human all too Human. Book was a major let down to me as 50% of the content seems to be worthless filler with the rest of the book being a mix of incoherent and fluffy discussion of trivial minutiae. Get Nietzches book or get The Book of Life byJ. Krishnamurti, it is 10000 times better than this book."
3,Ozma is a great character.,"Mostly good. I love Ozma. But alas, I do not like Dorothy, which is how I feel about Dorothy in all the Oz books."
3,"Story Great, Version Not So Much","I am currently reading through the Oz books and enjoying myself. This book has been wonderful with a small exception....the editing. I have run into a few problems with editing in Kindle books before, more in older books. Mostly it is easy to overlook. However with this one there are a few places where there are supposed to be notes that Dorthy reads aloud, but there is no text so you do not know what exactly was said. You just have to hope to understand with the actions that come next. The story I would give more stars, but they botched the editing in the version I downloaded."
5,The third book in the Oz series.,Ozma of oz is the third novel in the wondeful Oz series. People of all ages can enjoy this novel. It is about Doroth's second adventure in the wonderful land of oz. It tells the (although light hearted)story of good vs. evil. It is highly reccomended to anyone.GradeA+~Dan~
4,Good Book,This is a very quick and easy read. The book is entertaining and I enjoyed the lore of the land of OZ.
3,Ozma of Oz Review,"Ozma Of Oz by L. Frank BaumMy rating: 3 of 5 starsOzma of Oz is my favorite of the Oz series so far. The characters are strange, from the talking hen Billina to the wheelers and of course Tik-Tok. Dorothy Gale once again has an adventure through a strange land and sets out with her new friends to save the royal family of Ev from the Nome King, who has imprisoned them in his underground layer and turned them into ornaments to decorate his royal hall. Dorothy also gets to reunite with her old friends, the scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Corwardly Lion.My favorite part of Ozma of Oz is the part in the Nome King's layer and the puzzle Dorothy and her friends have to solve to free the royal family of Ev. I won't give any spoilers, but I did enjoy that part.Bottom Line: Ozma of Oz continues the Oz series and is the most enjoyable of the first three.Trev @ [...]"
3,"Lovely story, but...","This title apparently has no images. None of the original great art of the novel. And that's a problem, because there's at least one place in the store where the narrative stops, and the reader is supposed to read from the image in the book. Then the story continues as if you've read the image. But this version has no images, and no replacing text. So there's a discontinuity in the story where the image should have been. The story itself is great, but this version really does suffer for not having the original art."
4,The Best OZ so far,"This is the third OZ book I've read now and I have finally seen a little of what other readers must see in the series. The story succeeds on several levels. Children will enjoy the fantasy of it while adults can see the deeper ironys that abound. In fact, I have read other books that I thought were completely original but now I realize the authors had read Oz! I was happy to read about a couple of new Oz characters teaming up with the old favorites. Like other Oz books, this is a quick read but I plan to read more in the series, just to see what happens."
3,Less Edge and Bite than the first two in the series,"This book was good, but not great. It is the third Oz book that I have read to my four year old son. The first two in the series are full of more adventures, exciting characters and most importantly a frightening villian (The Wicked Witch, Mombi). The book had a good story, but was much more tame. We'll continue with the series, but this book does fall a couple stars short of the first two."
3,"Limited...interesting, but limited","Firstly, I will admit that I haven't read this book. I haven't read it because, after reading the table of contents, I noticed an ENORMOUS gapping hole in the author's otherwise interesting collection of research which immediately told me that it wasn't what I was looking for.I cannot imagine how any author could write a book about Ancient Inventions and not cover, at least in a cursory way, the invention of the loom or the kiln. Yet these crucial inventions are so taken for granted that they aren't even mentioned - not in the Table of Contents or in the Index. Dildos yes, but looms NO? Grenades yes, but kilns NO? Sorry, but the ingenuity it took to create a loom or a kiln are just as important to document as weapons and sex toys!I may end up buying the book - eventually - but not until I buy books that contain a more balanced view of ancient invention!"
5,Great Read...Down From the Mountain,"I read this book over the weekend in one delicious gulp. great read. a bit of history, some literary epics, memior, this is an important book about one of America's most put down regions. If you liked the Down From the Mountain music tour, and wished Nina Simone, jazz and the blues had been along, this book will thrill you."
2,It's Okay.,"""The United States of Appalachia"" by Jeff Biggers is something of a ""manifesto"" against the common traditional stereotypes of Appalachia combined with quite a bit of Liberal (or perhaps ""Progressive"") vaunting of Civil Rights History purported to be solely sub-text to the Appalachian story.... Practically to the point of being a separate book within the book. Is it worth reading? Yep. Does it have some really interesting parts? Yep. Are their better works? Yep. ""Appalachia: A History"" by John Alexander Williams is significantly better (imo) and more ""readable""."
5,Great Read,"I saw this author at the Virginia Book Festival. He is a terrific speaker. I sat spellbound for all of his presentation--or reading. The book, I was afraid, might let me down, but it didn't. It is as inspiring as Biggers' speaking style. In it, the author peels off one incredible story after another--most of which I had never heard before--from the time of the Cherokee and their Renaissance until today. There are more colorful characters than a Greek tragicomedy--and they're all true life figures. Biggers' thesis is simple: You can't understand America until you understand Appalachia. After reading this book, you will be a believer."
5,Silky smooth,I love using scrubs after I shave my legs but the salt ones sting. I tried a lot of sugar scrubs and they didn't seem to work as well as the salt ones ... Till I found this! Smells sweet and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth all day!
4,Lovely,"This scrub is great. I was worried about using a scrub bc of my sensitive skin, but it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. The ingredients are really great. The scrub smells pleasantly of sugar cane and isn't super perfumed. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little bit more abrasive."
2,So Oily!,"I really wanted to like this product for a few reasons. I like to use natural products and the reviews on here lead me to believe that it would work in exfoliating as well as moisturizing. That is in fact the point of an in shower body scrub (exfoliating) right? Wrong. I saw no benefit to using this scrub. It leaves your skin oily, I would not call this moisturized, and I have skin that accumulates gunk very easily as I have naturally oily skin so for anyone who has similar skin I would skip out on this product and go for something natural that actually does the job. Additionally this actually has added to the issue of stuff being in my pores on my back and everywhere because of the ""moisturizing"" effect it has on the skin."
2,The Salt scrub is way better..,I purchased the sugar scrub because I LOVE the salt scrub but it is totally different. This scrub does not do a good job at exfoliating. It's like hand lotion with sugar in it. More creamy than anything. Its ok to shave with but nothing like the salt scrub. I wouldn't purchase this again.
4,Wonderful scrub for sensitive skin,"I bought this after reading customer reviews and I love it. It has a nice soft vanilla scent. It really is a body ""polish"" - it gently scrubs off dead skin and leaves you feeling soft and smooth. I have always had bumps on my arms and tried lots of different things to get rid of them. This scrub has almost completely eliminated the bumps! I also recommend using after shaving, because it leaves a light coating on the skin that moisturizes. BUT - Do not use on your face if you have oily skin."
3,Tough to rate,"This product is exactly what I expected, except for the fact that it only lasted through about 10 showers--ran out quickly. It is ""oily"", which is what I was looking for. I like the scrubbing factor, the scent, and the sheen that it put on my skin afterward. However, it does not last long at all. Will not be re-purchasing for that reason."
2,Good until it stops working.,"This mouse worked wel enough up until it started dying on me this summer (NOTE: I bought my tablet and mouse in December). That's around 6 months of use. I did use it nearly everyday but I was very gentle with it. One day I noticed it took like 3 or 4 clicks just to get it to click right, and now it's like 10-11 or it just won't work. Then the scroll wheel lost its click and broke. What a P.O.S."
1,bad mouse,After 2 years of very light usage the main (left) button died. Wacom says I have to buy a new one for $70 plus tax and shipping. Yikes! My tablet and stylus are still OK; but this mouse is expensive garbage.
2,Don't buy,"For a 60 mouse I would have expected it to last longer than a year. My one started playing up and had developed some clicking issues (not clicking, double clicking, etc ...). Pretty appalling considering cheaper mice I own have lasted a lot longer.In the end I didn't buy a replacement as it was too expensive."
3,Works great until it doesn't anymore,"This mouse has a lot of positive attributes: it's cordless, batteryless, and reasonably precise, and if you like simplicity, it'll get the job done. Unfortunately, durability isn't among those attributes. Mine has worked flawlessly for about two years, but now its left button has begun to malfunction and often double-clicks when I single-click, or sometimes doesn't register a click at all. Apparently this a common problem with this mouse, and a strong burst of compressed air sometimes helps for a few hours, but it seems the thing is really on its way out. This wouldn't be such a big problem if not for its huge price tag and the Intuos' complete incompatibility with other mice."
2,"Great tablet, poor mouse","I first purchased my Intuos3 tablet in 2010, and am still using it. The mouse that came with it stopped registering right clicks in 2011, so I had to buy a replacement. I thought it was just a fluke, but when I bought the replacement, the new mouse's right clicks also stopped working. I looked online and found out that this was a common trend, for the mouse to last less than a year. It is now January, I bought the last mouse in April of last year, and it is not registering the right clicks, anymore.Wacom's response? ""We're sorry your mouse doesn't work anymore. Would you like to buy a new one for $70?""No, thank you, Wacom.The tablet works great, but now I have to use a USB mouse on top of it. It seems like a no-brainer, yes, but that's not the point. The point is, if I paid to have this 'special' mouse, I would expect it to work for longer than 10 months.I will not be buying a replacement."
1,Terrible build quality,"I've just finished my second one of these mice; both developed faulty left-click buttons, the second one in less than a year. For the absurdly high price, they're complete garbage."
1,Breaks after a few years,"Love the Intuos3 tablet, but my mouse right-click started getting glitchy after less than 2 years of use. This led me to come here and look at buying a new one. Couple of things I found out:1) Intuos3 mice are known to break (read the other reviews)2) You can not use an Intuos4 mouse with the Intuos3 (I thought maybe they fixed it in the next version)3) Intuos3 tablets come with a 2-year warranty!I went to wacom's website and filled out the support form asking if this could possibly be a software issue (Completely thinking the support would be worthless after reading the comments here).Wow, amazing support! - within minutes I got a reply from wacom asking for some details so they could check the warranty... and the next email back from wacom: a UPS tracking number - they are sending me a replacement mouse! It was the easiest warranty replacement I have ever done."
3,Perfect beach Reading Material!,"While I wouldn't exactly compare this collection of stories to THE BEST AMERICAN EROTICA or DESIRES, BLUE LIGHT does contain some very good sensual writing that encompass the diversity of Black sensuality without heavy-handed vulgarity.I found many of the passages here to be more heartwarming than flesh sizzling. A person that is curious about sensual fiction but uncomfortable with the idea of reading ""dirty stories"" will really appreciate this volume.Robotham did an excellent job selecting stories about young and mature love, passion, and obsession. I found the book to be funny, sexy, and enlightening and look forward to more volumes to come.Many of the stories are reprints from novels or other previously published works but, far from detracting from it's value, it may introduce the reader to some fabulous female authors. Alice Walker and Edwige Danticat are standouts. Enjoy!"
3,Ok for the price,It basically heats and vibrates. It is sort of relaxing but the constant vibration can be a bit much. You get what you pay for.
4,Beautiful Paper Dolls,"These paper dolls are beautiful, but they are not the punch out type. They will have to be cut out by hand. I am planning on using an x-acto knife. The dresses are very elaborate and will be a tough job to cut out for an adult. I hope my granddaughter appreciates the effort.The paper is very heavy which is great for the dresses. I intend to put the ladies on heavy cardboard to make them more durable. These are too beautiful not to make them last as long as possible. Once I cut them out, I intend to store them in page jackets to store them."
3,"There is talent, but often underplayed","Da Brat is talented, though Jermaine does not exhibit it as much as he could with this album by the young performer (at the time)...it met the need for the ATL, but she could blow it up more like Lyte."
4,Funkdafied!,Love Da Brat waaaay back when I was in high school and loved this cd. Her best cd hands down! It's FUNKDAFIED!!
2,2 Stars,"Da Brat may go down in history as one of the greatest female emcee's in history, but that doesn't mean I have to like her. This is a great CD production wise, but lyrically it is wack. She has a nice flow though. NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I bought this film for my high school senior English students as background information for our novel study of Great Expectations. Normally, I have students read and take notes from their text, The Language of Literature, as a prelude to studying the literature of a time period. However, with ""senioritis"" kicking in, I thought a documentary film would be a more engaging activity. Although it does not take much to put seniors to sleep, this film was difficult to stay awake for. The sound quality, when it came to the interviews (centered mostly on one expert), was poor. The excerpts from Dickens were extremely long and would have benefited from caricatures or illustrations instead of presenting a monologue by a narrator. Above all, their text introduces a wider range of issues and knowledge. After viewing the film, students took away little from the full picture of life in Victorian times."
5,Perfect for toddlers!,"My 20 month old absolutely loves this DVD. The characters are simple, yet entertaining and the scenarios are excellent for teaching emotional development. Highly recommend!"
3,Dark meanderings of loneliness and psychosis,"I read Steppenwolf after Siddhartha and was shocked at the contrast of prose and themes. Steppenwolf was, from what I understand, Hesse's most autobiographical novel. The novel evokes images of painful lonely isolation interrupted by brief flashes of joy in the midst of a colorful female companion, drink, and dance at a local tavern. The story takes strange and bizarre turns into psychotic dream sequences with such explicit vivid quality that I wondered if Hesse had his own psychotic episodes from prolonged isolation (he was was known as a recluse) or ingested hallucinogens. The prose is undeniably powerful and beautiful, but the themes and plot turns are dark, disturbing, and hallucinatory. I found the novel more insightful of Hesse's psychology and writing talents than one that I plan on reading again in the near future. Read Siddhartha for contrast and more steady meditative prose."
4,"Good, but not Hesse's best work.","This is the darkest Hesse book I have read yet. It is definetely worth reading, especially if you liked his other work. I personally think it is not his best, but it's an interesting character study of Harry Haller. A man who is struggling to balance his animal instincts and his human side. He shows constant contempt for the bourgeois society he lives in and it haunts his life.I reccomend this book which is probably the most famous Hesse novel. However, as I said, it's not what I would consider his best. If you like this one try Siddhartha and Demian."
2,Left me uninspired,"More philosophy than fiction - as a story it trudged along very slowly, and finished with a fizzle. The book kept me interested enough to finish, but just barely. No doubt I missed something, but I certainly won't be re-reading Steppenwolf to figure out what."
2,Confused man in Germany thinking about his position in life,"Too many metaphors, Hesse forgot what he was supposed to writ"
1,THIS IS IN GERMAN!!!,"There is no way to tell from the Amazon page, but this version is in the orginal German language. The title (Der Steppenwolf) does provide a hint, but it would certainly be nice if the knuckleheads at Amazon made it clearer.Der Steppenwolf"
5,Ten stars wouldn't do it justice...,"People always say how difficult it is to pick the five or ten greatest books ever written. Here's a handy hint to make it easier: Step 1) Write ""Steppenwolf - Hermann Hesse"" at no 1. Step 2) Build around it.If you ever wanted a real, authentic representation of the essence of being alive, complete with it's chaos, madness, paradox and stunning beauty, this is it. The closest ink will ever get to being flesh."
5,I cannot say enough good about this book,I cannot say enough good about this book. Hesse explores the effects that lack of humor can have on one's life. The chracter Hermine has to be one of the greatest characters ever created in any book. This book should be a must read for high school students.
2,Overrated,"It is a quick read so if one is interested they should pursue it, but with hesitation. It is not as good as the hype."
2,pretentious and sexist,"I had to read this book for a class on existentialism and found this book to be one of the most irritating books I have ever had to read. Herman Hesse name-drops elements of Eastern culture in an obnoxious attempt to make his novel more ""exotic"". The novel also reads like the pathetic wet dream of an old man. The protagonist of the book, a plain, bitter old man has sex with young, attractive women. And the protagonist openly acknowledges that he's really not drawn to them by their intelligence, only to their youth and good looks, going so far as to point out that one of the women really is too stupid for him. And there's a gratuitous hot-bisexual women scene. Way to alienate half of your audience, Hesse."
1,This book confused my innocent thoughts....,This book filled with violent thoughts and are not suitable for children to read. Especailly for school reading.
3,Judged by its cover,"I have not read the book, but judging by its cover it is a book about a half-man half-wolf. That subject has been a favorite with horror writers through out history."
4,music goes on a life of its own even after its creator(s)'s,"people gripe about this release with(out) reason. and it's their right. however, it's unfair not only to the musicianship of all those associated with this performance but also to ellington himself to lower this work. indeed, isn't the dream of any music-maker to create music that lives forever, or at least beyond the confines of the creator's own life? no one has a problem with those cd's titled beethoven...i do think this dvd is a fine piece of work, representative of a type of ellington who fuses jazz and classical for the betterment of the MUSIC!"
1,The whole package BUT...,"This DVD has the whole package going for it. The music was very well recorded. (I won't get into the technical aspects of it.) The picture looked great as well...but, and I hate to admit this being a music lover and an Ellington music lover, the Duke's music was good but the film was really boring to me. It wasn't just the religious aspect of the film either-I think I might have been bored to tears anyway. (Apologies to all those religious folks out there.) I found myself listening to the instrumentals and the introductions and moving on.My suggestion is stay with his records or CDs or tapes"
1,slow,In the beginning the story was interesting. Towards the middle it lost its focus and had too many side stories of characters that I found irrelevant. I finally gave up.
5,Accurate and beautiful,"I love everything about this deck. The artwork is lovely to say the least and the readings are right on the mark. Hands down, this has to be my favorite deck because it is both beautiful and precise. The descriptions of the cards themselves give the usual broad meaning, then a detailed description that gives more insightful interpretations. The cards are illustrated in beautiful color and each fey depicted is unique. You won't regret buying this deck!"
5,My Favourite Tarot Deck.,"This deck has given me the most accurat readings,given serious lessons in a gentle,yet powerful way.It's always right on the mark.I like it better than any of my other Tarot decks(I have 20).This is not a cutsey deck,but it is warm and friendly,and very lovely.I recommend it with all my heart to new and experienced readers alike.The book is informative,and fun to read."
5,Enchanting Set,"I find this set very enchanting, but then I like the Fairytale and Fairy type decks very much. This is very well put together, a friend of mine favors this over a lot of other decks, I love it and feel it's worth the money."
1,Concerned Parent,"Book should be entitled ""Dare to Hit Your Child with Whatever is Handy"". Dobsen extolls virtues of his wife snapping their not yet two-year-old with a switch across the shins, can you imagine? He also attests that he received great benefit, as a child, by being spontaneously walloped by his mom's girdle, complete with buckles and straps.The fact is, that spontaneous anger from a parent can be beneficial to a child, in seeing that his actions may set off undesired reactions. Yet, spontaneous violence sends an absolutely wrong message of physical superiority making ""right"" in a confrontational situation.My children turned out quite well, I think with equal parts luck, love, and parental boundries. I didn't get anything from this book (I read it years ago) that I utilized in child-rearing, except a dedication to never hit my children."
1,Need an excuse to batter your child??,"If you're looking for an excuse to abuse your child, this book is for you. If you are the victim of a monstrous parent like Dobson, this book will give you nightmares. He even describes, in detail, various physical abuse. Incredible that his books sell."
1,research only,"I needed this book for research, otherwise, I would never endorse or subscribe to buying any products by James Dobson. A seriously retro-and damaging portrayal of raising a child."
4,This book is an old friend.,"Out of the hundreds of books that I was forced to read through high school and college, maybe five caught my imagination. This was one of them. Before anyone was really interested in thinking about thinking, Bateson sat down and did so. He was attempting to raise a bunch of questions that might help some to in-form their search for understanding in the world, or at least for points to be curious about, which in his mind is where science has to begin if it wants to know anything. It certainly helped to inform my thinking.Not only did Bateson do a bang-up job of getting me to think in interesting or useful or maybe somewhat cleaner ways, he's actually pretty good at writing. ...."
1,Buzzwords mixed toghether in a pile of dross,"Take all the buzzwords in fashion in psychology and philosophy: classification, genotype, flexibility, somatic, discrete, threshold, characteristics, analytic... mix everything together and you get this book.In other words there's not an ounce of meaning in those 700 pages, it's all worthless. No case studies, no examples, long phrases full of self importance written by someone who thinks he's an authority in everything from zen to medecine to evolution theory to archeology. Not only does he prove he doesn't understand anything, you'll laugh yourself silly reading any paragraph of the book at random.If you have to read this for an assignment, you'd better change major and give it to your worst enemy for toilet paper. That's how low I think of this. And to think that a tree was felled for this. Ha !"
3,Kept my attention,This was an ok movie. Acting was intense. The directing was adequate. It had its enteraining moments and it kept me interested.
4,Fun movie if you don't live for taking movies too seriously,"It's not a high budget film, it's doesn't have big star actors or a famous director so have realistic expectations when turning this one onto the television. Yes the acting is rough and the production value/story is a little weak BUT I really enjoyed it! I read the other reviews and thought this must be terrible but decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did. This one made me pull my feet up onto the couch a couple times which hasn't happened in a long time. If you enjoy watching haunted house movies then it's worth the time to put this one under your belt and enjoy a few scares. However, if you watch movies with a notepad to dissect the story lines and comment on acting queues then skip this one because you'll spend more time writing than watching. I gave it a 4 star because we enjoyed watching it and appreciated a movie that could still startle us, that I think the some of the other reviewers were awfully harsh"
2,ElydiaM,I love going to the Whaley house and I was so excited when my daughter told me there was a movie about it. It was not a very good movie at all.Very poor acting. Some of the facts about the Whaleys were in it. But that was all.
2,The Haunting of Whaley House,"A friend of mine wanted to watch this. She liked it. I didn't. It's typical Haunted House stuff. Nothing profound or interesting, but I suppose they need to keep all those people in Hollywood employed while they're waiting to make The Great Films."
2,better garbage than usual,"Asylum Pictures usually puts out blatant rip offs of other films that are just horrible. Not the kind of horrible that it's fun to watch, but the kind of horrible that leaves you with regret you wasted your time.I rented this from RedBox not knowing it was from Asylum by the film description. had I known, I wouldn't have.It's one of the better films from Asylum, but not that much better. There's a few creepy scenes, but the plot is wooden and predictable. The acting is, well, low level.It's not that bad, but if you can find something else, watch that instead."
1,Effing Really!?!,"As a former film student, and still aspiring filmmaker/screenwriter I must denounce this as the worst kind of crap film making I have ever seen. One star is being generous. Lousy acting, poor camera work, writing so bad as to be in the realm of the ridiculous. The ""psychic"" guy and his ghost hunter pal were the worst. A suggestion to the producers of this crap fest: get a day job."
2,Not so great ghost story film,"This is another film about a haunted house which is getting very very burnt out now. Some of the gore scenes are o.k. but the acting is crappy to mediocre. Skip this one horror film fans, if you want to see a good new ghost story film try Lovely Molly which is one of the better haunted house ghost story films I have seen in afew years except for Grave Encounters."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Poor acting, cheaply made, corny. About as scarey as a box of rocks. Save your money, don't rent this one."
2,"Sort of a dark, silly comedy","The real Whaley House cannot be filmed in its interior, so they tried to copy it here. Anyway, there is nothing new here--a haunted old house, people dying and trapped inside, but there is some funny dialogue now and then to break up the tension. Not very memorable though."
1,The Haunting of Whaley House,This movie is worse than bad. The acting is horrible. The script is ghastly. The special effects are circa 1960. Renting this movie was a total waste of money and time. I rated it one star because you must make a selection. It really deserves no-stars.
1,Horrible movie,"I could've made a better movie in my backyard; with better actors. A total waste of time and money. Even if you love B-list scary movies, do NOT rent this."
4,Great but bigger than i thought,"After taking the risk of purchasing this item online and just by reading the other reviews i was a bit nervoous about it. but now I love it. Its bigger than i thought but i clip it on my waist and kept it moving. In the beginning it crashed on me but after i reset it, it went back to normal. The way the music is so organize its it easy to get around it."
1,It just doesn't work right!!!,"After numerous attempts to try to get clean playback on this unit, I cannot avoid weird noise glitches and sudden jumps from the middle of songs being listened to. Customer Support was completely useless and unfriendly. I returned it for a new one and the new one has the exact same problem. I followed all of their steps for updating the drivers and it makes no difference.I would not recommend this product to anyone that I like! One more thing; downloading songs into this device is extremely slow. It can take hours, during which, unknown errors occur which cause me to have to start the process over again.The battery indicator on my unit doesn't work either. It is completely untrustworthy.SonicBlue should really be ashamed of this product and their so called Customer Service dept!!!"
2,It is an advertising popup riot,"I own a Rio Riot, and it is fine for what it does. But in order to get music over to the Rio Riot, you have to use software from ""REAL"" -- and they put up an unending stream of popup advertising. I'm afraid to say that if I had known how abusive the software was, I would have gotten another brand of MP3 player."
5,Best MP3 player I have ever seen!!,"This is an awsome MP3 player, works like a charm. I have never had any problems with it. The features on this thing are great, like the playlists, random play, timer, and even a radio with 5 pre-set stations!! Look no further, this gives you the most bang for your buck!"
2,"Decent, but not worth the money","I was so excited about this thing when it came in the mail. Then I noticed the first thing to drop it down a star, the battery is internal and not replacable. Then I took the think to Iraq with me. This was an expirience all in itself, but then the battery shorted and fried the HD. So there went $200 down the drain, but it was nice while it lasted."
4,A Good Buy,"The Rio Riot is an excellent player. It's 20 GB storage is massive. The sound quality is great-- and I rip my CDs to WMA at just 96 kbps. The FM reception here in NY is very good as well-- I have been able to recieve all the strong stations clearly. While it takes a while to download hundreds of songs to the Riot, once the files are transferred they are very well organized and easy to find. The backlight could be clearer, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers say it is. It comes with Real Jukebox to rip and transfer songs, but Real has released a new driver that makes the Riot compatible with Windows Media Player 9.0-- making it much easier manage and transfer your music files. I have always hated Real Jukebox/Player. All in all, the Rio Riot is a great bargain."
2,"Close, but no cigar","good:device Interface very goodwith wma got thousands on songs on the device with great qualityproduct support were helpfulbad:Continual problems downloading tracks to device. when downloading a number of albums at one time, at least one track (randomly) is always getting corrupted.Albums with long names and 2 cd's get merged into one in the albums listingI spent hours trying old /new drivers, closing windows apps and services (from support: so the USB tranfer would not get interupted)Is't recognised in Explorer as a device, limited software available for downloading (Win Media player not supported) when downloading with real player its not even smart enough to exclude songs already on the device (get to listen to songs repeatadly without the repeat button)It's in the post on it's way backregards, Paul"
5,Wonderful,"Back in 1979, my father brought home a blue and silvery device that played cassette tapes. It was called a walkman, and at most, it would play 90 minutes of music. It was bulky, chunky and altogether wonderful.Now, on my desk, I have about 30 hours of music (and more will be loaded tonight) in a device that is smaller, lighter and sleeker than that original Walkman. It plays the songs I love in a randomized way - just like having my own radio station that knows exactly what I like. It's easy to load, easy to play and easy to carry. I am, in general, thrilled."
4,This is a GREAT MP3 PLAYER,"The Rio Riot is a Great mp3 player. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had fire wire. I would also like to see a better equalizer on it, the one it has is not bad but it only has two controls one for bass and one for treble. Now for the good points, it has a 20 GB hard drive, easy to use software and a battery that last for around 7 hours of playing time. Their is firmware update on sonicblues web sight which is the 1.19 version and they have a driver update for windows xp users but it is a beta version. I downloaded both and found no problems with them. If you are in the market for a mp3 player I would highly recommend it. When you do purchase it be sure to check the different wed sights because I found a lot of different prices out there. It ranged [in price] and some sights are giving free shipping with it."
1,A very disappointing and frustrating experience,"I could not recommend this product to anyone - based on my experience.I found that songs which played fine on my PC would skip on the Rio Riot, often followed by it hanging up. I had to carry a safety pin with me everywhere so I could use it to get to the recessed hard reset button (apprx every 20 minutes).I tried to wipe the memory completely and reload everything several times but to no avail. The skipping continued.I also found that after rebooting my PC, the real jukebox software that comes included would never be able to see that the Riot was connected - that meant re-installing the Real Jukebox software every time I wanted to change the songs loaded on the Riot.Have now invested in an iPod for windows and the experience has been a delight.Apple iPod - 5 starsRio Riot - 1 star (only because your scale doesn't go negative :)"
2,Lasted only six months,"Granted, I am tough on my personal electronics but at these prices I expect some reliability. After one day skiing with my Riot (no crashes, maybe a little moisture on the outside of the unit) the hard drive began to whir and the display starting looking funny. Within days, the machine is headed to the dustbin.Battery life and download times were average at best, but bearable. I understood that I was not buying a top of the line iPod so I was not expecting much, but the Riot did not meet my low expectations."
3,A good player but not the best,"I've had this unit since they were first introduced which was just pre-iPod. I would say for the money you should shop around, although this is an okay unit. Transfering is slow and not always error free but it gets the job done. A unit with firewire or USB 2.0 would be better. I have no plans on replacing my Riot as long as it works but by the time I do there will be plenty of options."
2,Not that great,"The hard drive is HUGE, but, if it constantly locks up and not all the selctions work and your battery life is less than 2 hrs, what is the point!"
5,A word on the songs that skip,"3 months later and I still love my Riot... Anyway, I have seen some complaints about ripping CDs and getting scratches, skips, cut offs etc. I downloaded the current Real One software and all that nonsense stopped for some reason. Now all my CDs go on to the Riot perfectly. I also downloaded some free music software from Earthlink which works like a charm. Just dump the CD this thing comes with and you'll have a blast getting all 400 CD's on this. Just had a party at Xmas, put about 30 Xmas albums on here and put it on the genre for Xmas on random and had super background music. All the techies at the party checked this thing out and loved it."
1,Unreliability,"We received our first player and it worked for about 3 days - during which time we spend about 8 hours loading music onto it. It then stopped working, so we sent it back to SonicBlue for a replacement. The replacement arrived and has never even turned on successfully. They have taken 2 weeks to arrange for us to ship it back free of charge for yet another replacement, and refuse to give a refund!"
1,Not What I Thought,"i bought this mp3 player about 6 months ago. at first it was great. now, its very disappointing. it never turns on when its supposed to. also, it is very difficult to charge. first, the device has to be turned on to charge. second, even if it is plugged in, it wont always charge. third, if the battery gets too low, it freezes the device. there have been many times when i have had the device plugged in overnite in the hopes of taking it with me the next day on a long trip. but the next morning, i find my battery is still dead, and the device is frozen.the only feature i like about this device, is the rio dj. it creates autoplaylists, based upon decade, genre, most recently transfered song, etc.this would be an excellent product, if the battery would work. but since it doesnt, its impossible to use."
3,Excellent and awful at the same time,"How can a device with such an amazing interface be so awful?If you get over the glitches and squeeks when you play back a lot of your tracks then let me know. I have tried everything including the new drivers and copying time and time again. Even lowering the quality of my tracks did not help.However what a cool interface, play tracks you've not heard for a long time, your favourites etc etc.Battery, I trained it and realised you have to charge it when it is on and not turned off. Now I don't have any problems its always on.Rugged, simple although I'd like to be able to take the tracks off.I'd compare it with my archos av420 but its a little unfair. Apart from the interface the archos beats it in every way.Buy an archos!"
2,discontinued - just talked to a Rio Rep yesterday,"Beware, this product is discontinued and SonicBlue is coming out with 20GB & 40GB replacement products within the next few months."
4,Love it or leave it.,"I think the rio riot is just great. I orginally bought it for my wife, but I love it so much that I just purchased another one for myself."
3,good device sucky software,"The Riot is a good size device for those who want to carry a large amount of music without bulky bags of CD's etc. In conjunction with an attachment I picked up at radio shack that attached to my car tape deck I can go on long car trips with only the Riot for company.Problem... the software is a major pain in the **( and primarily exists to get a monthly fee out of the purchaser. It is the only way to get an up to date software driver is to buy the On Line service and the far to complicated and ""busy"" screen you finally download insists that you must be connnected to the internet constantly when you are trying to run the software. The software is complicated, comes with incomplete documentation and is not intuitative to use.This is not the sort of device/software to use if you run primarily from a laptop because of the power save function that interfers with dowloads of MP3's I am still searching for a nice software package worthy of this neat little toy."
1,Disappointed,"I would not reccommend this MP3 player to anyone. The pro's: it can store alot of music (sounds good, huh). The cons are many (they out weigh the pro's by a mile). The software interface is very difficult which makes it hard to transfer anything from your pc. The corporation that makes this doesn't seem to respond to e-mail...but I did forget to look up their rating in Consumer reports (my bad)."
2,What about support?,"This player is OK at best. Yes it holds 20 gb of songs, which might be great if it had a useful search function, say to play all songs with ""Tricky"" in the filename or if it would play album tracks in numerical order. Imagine hearing the songs from Abbey Road in alphabetical order only. It's (stupid). If you run Windows 2000, the only software that will load songs into the player is a horrendous MoodLogic. Why wouldn't Rio's own RioPort Audio Manager work? Find something better. Good luck ..."
3,Lots of Room but slow transfers,"I like the layout of the Rio Riot, and I love the fact that it has 20gb of storage. I have a large MP3 collection. However if you want to transfer the full amount prepare to spend quite a bit of time. With the USB1.1 connection it's slow, plus the horrible Real Jukebox software slows the dumb thing down even more. I also had to load a new firmware (I like the ability to do that),because the original firmware would drain the batt, if it went into sleep mode. Currently I'm waiting to get my unit back from Sonic Blue, as the on/off switch broke. So watch out for that.If I had to do it over again I would have waited for the Nomad 3, (the 3 wasn't out when I bought the Riot)."
3,not so good,"id say this is probobly the bottom of the line jukebox, i had it for 6 months and i traded it in for a nomad 3. the rio riot freezes way to often and deosnt hold data, but the nomad does. the rios battery is in the unit so if you run out away from any outlet your skrewed. the rio dj is probobly its only good feature, but the ""entertain me"" feature always chooses the same songs over and over. also the usb connection is sub-par, its really slow and the cord is a unique one that you cant buy anywhere if you break it (they made the usb and headphone the same port) the nomad has firewire and much better tech support."
1,20 Gig Paper Weight,"I bought this particular MP3 player for several reasons. One was that I was going on deployments and was tired of carrying books of CDs that could get scratched, lost, or stolen. The 20 gig HD was perfect. The FM radio was an added bonus. And for a while, I loved this thing.However, when I had a problem with the battery, SONICBLUE would return my emails until I sent them 2 more. Then for no reason, the machine got stuck in a loop and would not come on. When I emailed SONICBLUE 3 times about this, they didn't even respond.I downloaded firmware, software, drivers and everything from the web site with no succes. It's been about 2 weeks since my last email and still no reponce. DONT BUY THIS PAPERWEIGHT. IT WILL CAUSE YOU GREAT FRUSTRATION. If nothing else I have said has convinced you, look at this. This unit first went on the market at almost $$$. Now, you can get for almost half that."
1,Riots are plagued with defective battery problems,"I have owned my Riot for only 3 months. The battery will no longer hold a charge. The player is now useless. SonciBlue only offers an exchange. All of the time spent uploading music files was wasted. I am going to get the exchange, sell it on ebay, and buy an iPod."
1,NO SUPPORT!!!,"I was able to use the FM radio only. The support behind the poor software is non existant. To make things worse, to talk with tech.support it must be on your dime in the middle of the day. I e-mailed for 3 days with no response and asked them to call me. Bottom line, the Rio Riot never worked and I never heard from Sonic Blue. A company that truely is out of control."
1,Rio Riot = Slow & Clunky,"Yes, 20-GB is a lot of memory. However, the Rio Riot is also physically large and not 'shirt pocket size' like the iPod. You'll need both hands to use this clunky player. The Rio Riot also falls short with the slow USB connection. ... A 5 GB transfer to this player will take 7 hours. With the iPod, this would only take 20 minutes! Also the FM tuner is very weak and has trouble picking even the strongest stations. Bottom line: if you want a sleek mp3 player with ultra fast firewire and great battery life, get an iPod."
3,"Great sound, but battery problems","Although the Rio Riot is quite a piece of equipment, I'm returning it today.Pros: EXCELLENT sound, best I've ever heard. Great interface. Amazing capacity. Decent radio. Nice carrying case.Cons: A bit big, but who cares? Very slow transfers (slower than normal USB transfers.) Songs aren't synced to desktop computer.Deal-breaker: The battery. They recommend you drain it completely before fully charging, which sounds like old tech. Battery life can be 10 hours, but frequently, is far less, even after full drain/recharge. Sometimes, battery reads empty even when fully charged. Also, you can't change the battery or buy a spare... not good if you want to take it with you for more than 10 hours at a time!Sorry, folks... I don't think this is ready for prime-time just yet."
4,Get What Ya Pay For,"I stumbled into this device after I purchased and RCA LYRA Jukebox.. and if you happen to be one of the people who thinks this player stinks.. dang.. try the Lyra. You'll love the RioRiot after that.The biggest complaint I have had with the unit is the software. You can download the update for Windows Media Player that will let you use that to load software. True.But there is another choice. I use Sveta Portable Audio. It actually replaces the software that comes with a LOT of different players, including the RioVolt. It's shareware and you can get it at http://www.dbpoweramp.com/Is it perfect? Nope. Not perfect. But it's better than anything else I've used and I like it.Hope some of you find this helpful......."
1,Wonder how a 20 GB MP3 player can be SO ...?,"Because that's exactly what it is... And not just in the inexpensive sense. I bought this piece of junk months ago and it simply has so many annoying quirks and glitches. The customer support sucks and they won't do anything for you. Buy a Zen, iPod, or Archos instead, just ANYTHING but this."
1,The absolute worst investment you can make...,"I've rated this before, but I really think anyone should know how Very, Very bad the hardware is on this machine. Don't do it! Go for a Zen!"
2,Disappointed,"I'm a huge huge fan of the Rio product line. I owned 3 Rio 300's, 2 Rio 500's, and 2 Rio Volts - these are all wildly fantastic products! I also own a Rio ReplayTV system - another unbelievably great product. My wife bought me the Rio Riot for our anniversary from Amazon.com and it's the first Rio product that really isn't up to par. I'm already a big MP3 music fan, so I have both iTunes and RealJukebox installed. You CANNOT use the Rio Riot with an existing copy of RealJukebox. I verified this with Rio tech support. The Rio Riot simply did not show up under iTunes no matter how many times I installed and used different USB cables. This definitely won't be my last Rio product, but I'm no longer going to buy their products so confidently. If you are a realy MP3 fan, you can trust my advice to pass over this one."
1,Features Looked Great But. . .,"I'll start out by saying that I'm returning this thing immediately. The included software is Real Jukebox and the drivers disable it from working with Windows Media or even being recognized as an audio device by Windows. ...Aside from the software issue, the transfer speeds are sloooow. How about firewire or USB 2.0?Although the screen is nice and big, the navigation is lacking. No ability to queue up songs and playlist management is difficult (also playlists cannot be managed by the software, only the player).The deal breaker is the battery. It is without a doubt low-tech. Each time you use the Riot you end up having to recalibrate the battery (takes about 13 hours). The worst detail is that the battery continues to drain even if the player is turned off!Save your money and go with something smaller. The Rio Riot would is a waste of money..."
1,Not Ready For Prime Time!,"Great concept, but poor quality.After a weeks worth of use, the battery went dead and won't hold a charge. The battery implementation is sub-par, suffering from a poor visual indicator, to a charging scenario that's designed to cause a failure. The documentation gives two different recommneded charging times (4 to 6 or 6 to 8 ) hours, and there's no mechanism to prevent overcharging. Net your bound to overcharge and eventually ruin the battery.Wait for rev 2!"
5,Fun and Convenient,"This is a great MP3 player!! I read many reviews before purchasing the Rio Riot. The positive reviews far outweighed the negative, so I took a chance. And I am glad that I made this purchase. The Rio Riot is wonderful. The sound is great and it holds ALL of my 250 CDs with much room to spare. I use Windows XP and at first I did have some problems with the USB connection, but no longer. The only negatives I found thus far are the headphones, they are pitiful and the software is even worse. I have replaced with the headphones for better sound and I have to just live with the software until there is something better. I love attaching the Riot to speakers and listening to a great mix of music anytime. The Riot is awesome!"
2,"A decent design, but ...","The Rio Riot is a product that, to be blunt, needed about three more months of solid testing and ""fixing"" before being released. One of my biggest complaints, and one that isn't addressed much in others' reviews, has to do with battery charging.To begin with, the battery doesn't charge at all unless the player is turned on. (This is mentioned briefly in one of the paper ""read me"" documents in the box, but not in the manual itself.)What's worse, though, is that it the player doesn't hold its charge. A fully-charged player, turned off and sitting for about a day, loses roughly 20% of that charge. Leave it for a week, and you'd better plan on doing a full recharge before taking it anywhere, because it won't last an hour.Given the big price, the terrible software it ships with, and the alternatives in the market (including the iPod and the new Nomad), I couldn't recommend the Riot to a friend."
2,Great idea but poor design!,"I was looking for a 20 gig player and the Riot looked like the one for me! It only took me about 2 days to really hate this thing. The concept is great, but seems like it got lost in the design process. The USB 1.1 interface for transfering music files is painfully slow, I still cannot figure out why the designers did not use USB 2.0 or firewire? You have to use Real Jukebox to transfer music files which makes it more difficult than ever.On the brighter side was the menu layout and controls, very nice to use. Sound quality was acceptable....P>I ended up buying the Archos 20 gig Jukebox player/Recorder and I really love it, it has it's quirks too but all around a much more pleasant experience to use"
2,"Great Hardware, Terrible Software Ruins It.","I love the device. The display is great, the buttons and interface are great, and the sound is great.HOWEVER.When loading music onto the device using the WinXP driver, your songs are polluted with chirps, clicks, pops and sometimes are truncated entirely.The last update to this driver was in 4/02 and it is now 10/02...not a good sign that SonicBlue cares enough to fix the problem.As a last resort (just to the get the music loaded) I installed Win98 and started to load the songs. Loading the songs with Win98 worked - they didn't get corrupt - but the crappy Real software kept hanging Windows! (And this is on a clean virgin install!)My advice: avoid unless drivers are corrected. I've fought with it all week and sadly, I will be returning mine.Again, the hardware itself is just great - if only SonicBLue/Diamond would fix the drivers, the device would be top notch."
2,Boring,I bought this based on the good reviews. My 9yo son was very disappointed in the game. It sounds way more fun than it actually is. Glad I bought it cheep!
2,Boring,"My 8 year old son bought this game. He enjoys the cartoon. However, he thought it was going to be an adventure game with fighting, not a simple plain fighting game. He grew bored with it in a matter of minutes. I looked at the reviews prior to buying the game. It had good reviews, but I should have read all the reviews. This game doesn't seem to have a story, just plain combat in the likes of Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. Avoid this game if you want a story or adventure."
4,"Insane, but fun...","This game is pretty fun. It is non-stop insanity where you are basically just beating up other characters from the show. I played it for 2 hours straight and didn't even realize that so much time had passed. It is sort of mind-numbing, but sometimes that's a good thing..."
2,Nice Design...Poor Quality,Taking into account the rest of the reviews...I must've gotten a bad copy. The ring itself would be beautiful if it were cut or molded right. The points in the center don't line up. Also the sides of the cross aren't parallel. They are definitely slanted. Going to return this asap. For almost $80...I expected much better.
2,Okay until it died,"Had this lighting setup for about 2 years, which is not bad, but then it just unexpectedly stopped working. This is because there is NO water blocking shield on the light at all, which over time caused water to build up in the unit and caused it to die. This could easily be fixed by a simple shield, unfortunately the light doesn't come with one. I was disappointed to see it go and will be switching to an Aqueon LED setup."
5,Perfect for Saltwater Aquariums,"I like the fact that you can get higher lighting output with the mirrored backing on this one plus the right bulbs. Or you can subdue it a bit by adding a blue bulb to a standard white (multi-spectrum) bulb. All in all, I find this to be a very good light for the money and especially for anybody looking for extra illumination for corals or invertebrates in a salt water aquarium."
3,Nice light,"I bought this through Amazon.My ratings out of 5Shipping rating: -1Item was shipped in the display box with no packing materials around the fixture. Only tapped in two spots. Very glad it did not come with bulbs or I would have had glass everywhere. Shipping was fast though.Item quality: 4The fixture is well built with a nice reflector design. I do wish the power cord exited out the back of the fixture instead of the end. This caused some problems with my hood. Also the stands included can not be used with a acrylic tank. Included timer is ok. Nothing special but functions ok.Item in use: 5Very bright output, my tank is 24"" deep and it penetrated to the bottom. Fixture stays warm but not hot.Over all if you have a standard 48"" standard glass tank or edgeless tank this light will make you happy. Works with some DIY for acrylic tanks."
1,Very Disappointed,"Received frame from All Wedding Gifts, it had been sent by USPS in a bubble wrap envelope, so I received it damaged. At first they did not answer my e-mail, so I contacted Amazon and they credited back my account.Would not purchase from this vendor."
2,"Please see my review for ""Life in Medieval Times""","...the quality is the same, as is some of the footage!"
1,"""The Witch's Master Grimoire- Of Love Binding Spells""","I was rather disappointed after reading this book and I had to force myself to read it through. It would suit the book better for the title to be ""Love spells and a Bit more"". I was sorry to see that almost every page of this book had a ""Love Binding"" spell on it, Or something along the lines of ""Spells to make (force) someone fall in love with you"", Love Potions, Bind a Love to you, ex... It did have some insightful information in it but only a small amount compared to the ""Love Binding Spells, Formulas, and Rites. This book was ""The Witch's Master Grimoire- Of Love Binding Spells"" Im sorry I spent my money on it."
3,Nice to have on hand,"Yes, it's lacking in a ton of information, but it's laid out in an easy-access, alphabetical manor, and does contain a nice handful of spells. It also contains a little bit of information on a lot of things, and would be a good book to turn to when looking to get into a certain subject, and need a place to start. It's a very easy read, and a useful reference encyclopedia."
3,Although the casting & acting ...,"... are flawless, the sets superb, everybody remember Victor Hugo wrote a book, but not so many seem to remember the story he wrote, since a lot of the script (especially the preposterous ""happy"" ending) come from shameless Hollywood tradition about thinking (are they able to think anyway?) their way of reinventing any story is the best in the world. Anyone who have read the book should forget he did, so one can enjoy the other qualities of this movie.Anyway, I think Victor Hugo stopped quite a while ago worrying about copyright's infringement, which, unfortunately doesn't apply to the Hollywood Factory (ask any author who's been conned, there's no shortage), only to the consumers of their products."
1,Hunchback of notre dame,"you sent me the wrong movie 3 times in a row even after contacting you both in writing and verbally each time, you failed to follow up by not finding the correct version of the movie. The movie you are advertising claims it stars Maureen O'Hara and Charles Laughton when in fact it is the silent version starring Lon Chaney. I am very disapointed with your service."
5,Better than the book...,"The plot for this hunchback is the precursor of the Disney version, only darker. Charles Laughton brilliantly portrays Quasimado, in one of his best roles. The sets make you believe the movie was filmed on location, in renaissance-era Paris, and you get caught up in the story, with all its stark beauty and tragic ugliness. Black and white."
4,A Film About Enlightenment and Reason,"RKO's 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame with Charles Laughton is a pleasant mixture of literary renaissance France and of Hollywood. Saliant points within the dialogue convey many of author Victor Hugo's sentiments, while director William Dieterle and company never lose sight of the fact that the movie is entertainment. It is not within the scope of any reviewer, who may dislike the movie, to go further by presuming to know why others do like it. Such assumptions are an exercise in arrogant arm chair psychology."
3,Latest Release Is November 2010 for less money here at Amazon,"Latest Release Is November 2010 for less money here at Amazon.Amazon is combining the 2010 reviews with the 1998 reviews.This review is to let you know that the Nov 2010 version is around $10 and is 12 years newer.I only have the 2010 version so I am unable to compare quality.Also I do NOT need some pin head telling me that this area is ONLY for review of the movie.We all know about the movie, but all of us do NOT know about the later release for less money which I believe is helpful."
5,The Hunchback of Notre Dame,I first recall seeing this movie as a student in Junior High long ago. It is with out a doubt one of the classics. The cast is outstanding.When I saw that the VHS version of the movie was available at an inexpensive price I had to buy it. Buy this film and you will have a classic.
4,Laughton is Amazing,"Charles Laughton is one of the great actors of all time. Watching this version of Vitor Hugo's novel it is not hard to see why. Laughton looks like he was born to play Quasimodo, the deaf and disfigured bell keeper of Notre Dome Cathedral. Wearing heavy face make up and a body suit, Laughton literally transformed himself to play the part. This novel has been adapted several times for the screen , but this is the best one. The performances are on the whole excellent. Particularly Cedric Hardwicke as the cold Chief Justice of Paris. Maureen O'Hara also gives a strong performance as Esmeralda. The direction of William Dieterle is very good, although he concentates a little too much on the subplots at times. On the whole this is an excellent film, that despite it's age, hardly seems dated. The story is a timeless classic and so is this film. Watch it just for Laughton's performance."
3,Not what I expected..,"l was thought to believe that this was a one piece floor mat. Its in two pieces, one piece covers one side and past the middle. The other piece covers the remainder of the floor with an overlap. Its not what I expected."
3,probably the worst in a great series,"Six volumes in this series, as well as the companion disc ""Club Columbia"" which started this series, gets you a load of 12"" versions never before on CD. Unfortunately, this volume skimps on 12"" or long versions. Track list:1. boogie night (12"" version) (4:44) (album version is longer!)2. night (feel like getting down) (4:40)3. dance to the music (remix) (6:35)4. I've got the next dance (5:52)5. instant replay (8:15)6. you spin me round (7:59)7. do it anyway you wanna (3:12)8. love train (6:15)9. let's groove (5:29)10. soul city walk (3:08)11. dancing man (2:36)12. ain't gonna bump no more (3:28)13. dreamin (5:13)14. love I lost (6:18)15. I am what I am (3:14)"
5,Fabulous all around,"The Stetson After Shave is exactly as described, but the news here is the company, Tuccini. They went out of their way to make this a wonderful shopping experience. I had to contact customer service with a problem and they handled it with complete professionalism and promptness. You can't do much better than this. Kudos and thanks, Tuccini."
4,Best I've found for the price,"I recently purchased the GR-D770 MiniDV Camcorder to replace an eight year old JVC VHS-C camcorder. I did a bit of research online, and the JVC had to most features for the cost. The audio is excellent, as is the picture quality. The zoom is smooth, and all the controls are conveniently located; the menus are easy to navigate with the thumb stick. Also, synching is up to my laptop was a snap, after I bought a 4-pin to 4-pin DV cable (I didn't see any in the price range that included one)."
1,JVC GRD770 MiniDV Camcorder,I have had multiple issues with this camcorder. It was used a total of less than 60 minutes and then put away for several months (inside the air-conditioned house). Now the screen no longer works; it won't record videos; and the DV connector to transfer what little footage I have doesn't recognize the camera. I bought a replacement camcorder to get the footage off the film and it transferred easily -- so it isn't an issue with the computer or software.I will not purchase another JVC camcorder as they want more to repair this one than it costs to purchase a new one.
3,Worked great for two years and then...,"I bought this model in May of 2007. It worked exceptionally well for two years. Transferred footage with no problem to the computer and it's been great to have.It is now July of 2009 and two weeks ago I started to get a burnt out pixel in my recordings. I first thought it was the video display, but upon transfer it is burnt into the recording as well.It pretty much kills the family footage because you tend to just stare at the darn thing. When I do zoom to the digital level the red dot moves off screen, but I don't see myself doing that for my recordings.So, it's worked good for 3 years, but it has no longevity I think as is the case with electronics these days.I had an 80's betamax and 80's VHS and those lasted almost 20 years..."
2,JVC GR-D750 and GR-D770 mini DV camcorders,"I purchased a JVC mini DV camcorder (750) and it worked wonderfully until after 3 yrs. the motor quit and I paid $50 to have it serviced only to find out it would cost $283 to repair, which is a little more than I originally paid for it! I was in need of a new camera as there was no other way to play the mini tapes of my baby daughter unless I wanted to pay thousands of dollars for a mini duel deck VCR. So, I purchased a used 750 from Amazon which had problems of its own, then I tried a used 770 which had the exact same problem and error messages as my original. So, from what I can tell, these cameras aren't very durable and don't last. At least that's been my experience w. JVC. Who knows about other brands. Bottom line is, once the camera messes up, there's no way to review your tapes unless of course you have them transferred immediately after recording. I would not recommend!"
3,MENU button doesn t work,"Bought this from Amazon 3 weeks ago. The image quality is OK. I didn t expect too much from such entry level camcorder. When I tried to adjust the settings I found the ""MENU"" button doesn t work anymore. If I remove the battery for some time and put it back the ""MENU"" goes back to work for a few seconds and no response then."
5,Recommended for all Model Railroaders,"Whether you are an novice or expert this book covers the fundamentals to ther complexities of wood working for model railroad applications.Very well presentedin simple language and with very nice coverage on the subject, has adequate photos and good detail."
4,Very helpful,"Using the illustrations in this book, I was able to build a pretty descent train platform. This is saying something seeing as I am ""unhandy"". It has simple designs all the way to the more complex. The author lets you know beforehand the materials and tools each project needs, which is handy. Overall a very good book."
3,Not so bad,"The item was packed well. However, I used it with a black keyboard which is not the ideal way to use it. I can barely see the stickers! Therefore, I would recommend that you have a white keyboard or grey one to be used with this stickers."
4,"Great for Grammar and reading practice, Not so much so for spoken language","We used this book in my college Japanese class.It's very good if you want a very in depth look at the japanese written/read language and grammar... though I feel this is a great learning aid, I also feel bombarded with the amount of grammar explanations in this book, my classmates and I struggled to really learn how to speak/communicate, though most of us feel fairly proficient with reading/writing now.However, even though I am giving it 4 stars (it really is a good learning aid), I do feel there are better books out there for learning to SPEAK Japanese, that are much less grammar oriented."
1,Terrible,"My class had to use this textbook at UK (University of Kentucky) for JPN101 and JPN102. It severely lacks in its examples, the dictionary in the back is incomplete as is the index. A word and it's English meaning can be found *somewhere* in the book if it's not in the dictionary, but that makes it that much more of a pain to find it. Certain things that we learned in parts of the book wouldn't be mentioned or shown at all throughout the rest of it.I'm fairly certain we only used this trash because one of UK's staff has his name in the book.If possible, I implore any university or self-studying person to use the Genki series that's used throughout Japan and is available for use here in the U.S. as well."
1,Worthless,"It's sad that we use this book at my University. I love my Japanese professors. They are great, and very knowledgeable. However, the book is just bad. I do very well with writing and pronunciation, but grammar is what confuses me the most. That is because this book is just bad at explaining it, and is laid out very poorly. Sadly, grammar is the building block of speaking correctly. The book simply throws things at you with no way of building up knowledge in an organized fashion. Thank god for the internet and library!"
3,It's Really Not That Bad,"If you have a good teacher and you use the website ([...]) and you get the compatible workbook, it's not so bad. Learning Japanese isn't ever going to be easy and there isn't a magic textbook to do that, but this one helps you out as best a textbook can. It's a bit hard to navigate sometimes, but the basics are all here. It's expensive, but so are all mandatory college textbooks. Again, you need the website above to hear the pronunciation and the workbook for more hands on learning, but this is a good reference to have. If you're in a classroom, this is a good book."
3,I am not sure that I will be able to finish this book.,"I purchased this book because I loved ""The Street"".However, I find this book to be very difficult to read. It is a slow read and hard to follow.I don't think that I will be able to continue reading this book."
2,A Boring Mess,"Fans of Sinclair Lewis, John Ford, and Ronald Colman, should try to find and burn every copy of this movie in existence. This has to be THE WORST adaptation ever of a great book made into a movie, and honestly, no excuses for it being made in 1931. Not that it's in the same vein, or faithful to its original, but one should remember that Frankenstein was made the same year, so the art of making ""talkies"" didn't have to suffer in the hands of a great director, or await new technological developments!Imagine someone who has seen Dodsworth, one of the greatest, as well as one of the most adult films of all time, and has read both that book and Arrowsmith, then coming across this ridiculous movie. What were they thinking?"
3,early john ford is worth checking out,"this is the other 1930s sinclair lewis adaptation (i.e. NOT the superior ""dodsworth""), and while its not in a league with ""dodsworth"", it is still a good movie. ronald colman (my very favorite actor) stars as a young doctor torn between career and love. i have never read the book, but my guess is alot gets left out in the telling."
4,Excellent film,"While the humour of Williams is extremely funny in this film, it is not a accurate depiction of the real Adrian Cronauer. To be fair the film does not claim to be a factual biography and does tell a good story about different cultures and war. However, I think the crowning achievement of the film comes toward the end when Williams queues up Louis Armstong's ""What A Wonderful World"" and we listen to Satchmo sing while we witness a montage of war scenes. It is perhaps some of the most powerful moments of film Hollywood has ever produced and the film is worth owning for that footage alone."
4,Robin Williams in one of his best!,"What a great movie! I've had this movie on VHS for years and was so very glad to find it on DVD. It truly is one of Robin Williams best movie roles. The movie is funny, tender, and touching. This movie also was my introduction to Forest Whitaker as an actor. How could you go wrong here..Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker in Good Morning Vietnam."
1,Good Morning Vietnam,The tape was defective and I was unable to view the remainder of the movie. Very poor way to conduct business
4,Humor In the Middle of War,"This is one movie experience that you shouldn't miss! Get a dose of Robin Williams' outstanding comic yet brilliant acting for this Barry Levinson film about the era when war torn out Vietnam. I have seen this fil for four times already and I could say that this movie truly capitulates the importance of humor in the middle of tense and severe situation. Yeah, we all know that we shouldn't take this situation as funny but hey, life isn't all about struggle...humor lightens it."
2,Thought it would be better...,Was so happy to have found this edition of Robin Williams' Good Morning Vietnam only to find out that even though it looked factory wrapped when we played it the spoken words did not match their lip movement. There was enough through the first ten minutes that you just didn't want to watch it. The words seemed to be more than thirty seconds to a minute behind the movement of the actors and their facial expressions. Made a great movie impossible to watch. I will say that when I went to return it to Amazon they did send me another one which was fine.
5,Goooood Morning Vieeetnahm!,"This movie is my favorite classic. So many great moments to remember. Very funny, very sad. Everyone should see it."
4,Good Morning Vietnam,I had it recorded on VHS and I liked the movie it brought back alot of memories of that era. I'm glad to have it on DVD and have the closed captioning I desperately need to enjoy it.
2,not as avertised..editted movie,"the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointting"
2,Messy,"I'm not sure if this product actually works or not as far as helping to establish your beneficial bacterial colony. The ""bacteria"" is mixed in with bran flakes and floats around on the water surface. Really messy in a small aquarium. Might be okay for a pond or outside water garden with fish."
1,MISSING MUSIC,"BOOKER was a show in which music was an integral part of the overall feel of the show. But, as with 21 JUMP STREET, the dvd release has stripped all the music, taking away what gave the show a distinctly hip edge. At a time when shows were only beginning to showcase music cues, BOOKER as well as JUMP STREET went a step further, telling us in the opening credits what artists would be featured. Now, of course, Mill Creek is a bare-bones operation, so I wasn't expecting anything other than what I got. And it's nice to see a pristine print (which actually DID surprise me) for the show. But no Billy Idol during the OPENING? No B.B. King episode SOMEBODY STOLE LUCILLE? They even left the names of some of the artists in the credits, but still didn't PLAY THE SONGS! Get a decent bootleg, where you can experience it the way it should be experienced."
4,Fun show but packaging lacking,"I've watched a few episodes of ""Booker"" now and it's just as ridiculous as I expected it to be, but also entertaining, a time capsule of sorts for the late '80s. I'm really happy I bought the set, but am also a little bothered by the actual discs being packaged in individual sleeves that risk scratching the discs. But, again, I am glad I have the show."
3,Worth watching,"A steadfast fan of 21 Jump Street - Booker was my second favourite character (after Tom).The series starts off really well, but during the last 10 or so episodes Booker goes from being a loner with a fantastic secretary - to the secretary getting married and Lori Petty being reinserted into the series as the very annoying Suzanne (I liked her in the first episode she appeared - but it is just too much) and having a bestfriend (previously unmentioned up to the point).The storylines are quite good and the series is worth watching. It has some fantastic guest appearances by Mariska Hargitay (Law and Order SVU) and Don S. Davis (Stargate SG1).Any fan of 21 Jump Street needs to watch this - even if Booker never does track down the villan from the crossover episode."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the entire 21 Jump Street series a few years ago and Booker was the main reason I loved it so much. I was super excited when I found out that there had also been a series created that just focused on his character, but then I was disappointed when I watched it and wasn't hooked like I had been with 21 Jump Street. Richard Grieco still does a great job, but the drama just wasn't as strong as it had been on Jump Street. I only made it through one disc though and I never bothered to see if it gets better after the first few episodes."
3,Pretty good.,Booker was alright. Butt beware an episode is missing from this set. Wish it would have lasted longer. But Richard Greico was alright.
3,Booker tv series,"I enjoyed the Booker dvds. I wish they would have included the 2 episodes missing from this set (the 21 Jump St. crossover episode Deals and Wheels, and the BB King episode Someone Stole Lucille). If those 2 episodes were included, it would have been a perfect set. Other than that, it is still a good value for the money."
4,Transition of Excursion,"This album opens as picking up where ""Acoustic Planet"" was left off, but as well opens into Smooth Jazz territory where Chaquico, here, urbanizes his Smooth Jazz sound. The transition of the two different themes (the more Native New-Age to Smooth Jazz) is a compelling excursion as Chaquico leads onward into muscial destination.Ben.the 15 year old."
4,Finally,"An ""After The Dust Has Settled"" realistic and compelling read on exactly how we all use the web, and several terrific examples of how real businesses - pure play web and brick & mortar - connect. The research, examples, and questions as to how to apply this methodology to every business' day-to-day operations is invaluable for anybody seeking to reach the Centaur in all of us."
2,Not Good At All,This guitar is not very great at all. The buttons began sticking almost immediately and it disconnects from the playstation on its own all the time. Consumers are not recommended to buy this guitar
2,bad equipment,I bought this guitar and noticed on the hour playing it that the product was defected and didn't work properly.need to return it but it looks like it's gonna be a hassle doing it for the time it took it to arrive
5,Wife prefers this one to our GHIII controller,My wife prefers this controller to the one packaged with the GHIII game. It seems to strum just a little bit quicker. It's worked great and I'd have no problem recommending it to a friend
4,Best non-bundle guitar,"I've tried several guitars. Other than what comes with the Activision bundles, this is the only reliable guitar - buttons have good react time, strum and whammy have good action. Everything else I've tried breaks within only a few weeks of moderate use. Someone out there could make a killing developing a reliable guitar for this game. This one is good, but not great. But it's way better than just about anything else."
1,Embarassing gift... piece of junk,"I got this guitar along with Guitar Hero I and II for my little brother for Christmas. I was really excited and he was SUPER excited... until we plug it in and it wouldn't work. Turns out the base station was broken - it wouldn't link up to the guitar. We tried everything. We turned off our cell phones, we disconnected our wireless router... We followed all of the instructions.We returned it to get a new one and THAT ONE BROKE!! We had it for about two hours... and then the second guitar's connection wouldn't link up to the base station.The concept is cool - wireless controller - but Activision clearly does not have the technical competency to make it work.This is the most awful gift I've ever given. I feel bad about giving this piece of junk to my brother: He was so excited to play this game... and his heart has been broken. He's been sad and frustrated.This was supposed to be a gift!"
1,There are better options,"Despite reading some of the negative reviews I wanted to give this guitar a try; I have a friend who has one and likes it. Unfortunately though I had to return it. As soon as I turned it on and fired up a game, I could tell it was defective.The buttons seemed to work OK, but about a third of my strums were registering twice. If I strummed very lightly it would work fine, but as soon as I started rocking out a bit more I started seeing a lot of extra strums. When I tried strumming up that seemed to work OK, but it felt very unnatural for me.After returning this I bought a ""PS2 Guitar Hero World Tour - Stand Alone Guitar"" and the difference is like night and day. It's about the same price, and for anyone looking for a replacement guitar I would recommend it over this one."
1,Terrible quality,Notes stick ALOT and my yellow button broke already and I took great care of it. DON'T BUY THIS!!! Buy the ones with the cords they're way better.
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I recently decided I'd teach my girlfriend how to play Guitar Hero. Well then I decided it was time to pick up a second guitar so we could play head to head. After taking some thought on the matter I decided I was going to go wireless. Very good decision I might add. This controller has great range. Performs just as well if not better than the standard wired controller. Only difference between the two is obviously the body style, and the fret buttons are slightly recessed on the wireless. They don't stick out quite as far as the wired controller. I like this feature though. I find it easier to play faster note patterns with it like this. Great product!"
3,Company stood by their product,"I received the Clemson watch on time, but the product was very poorly packaged. It's amazing the watch did not sustain damage during shipment. The watch was FILTHY when I received it. It looked like someone had worn the watch. It also did not come with an instruction booklet. Do not trust this company!!!! I was very displeased with the service from Online Sports. Watch itself, if was clean, would be a great gift.NEW UPDATE After talking with Online Sports, they were very cooperative and sent me a brand new watch. The representative was very cordial and continued to contact me to make sure I was satisfied with the product. The second watch I received was brand new and clean and works very well. Nice Clemson watch. I retract my statement -Online Sports is a very good company to deal with. They believe in quality and customer satisfaction."
3,pretty good,"Johnny Kemp had a couple of tight jams back in the day. Just got paid the Teddy Riley New Jack Swing Produced Jam was one of them,but my favorite by Kemp was Just another Lover. I use to blast the regular and 12 inch version back in 86. I still remember when Johnny Kemp rocked that jam on Dick clark's American Bandstand. this collections features his hits and also re-mixes to cuts. it is a pretty good collection."
3,Missing 3 episodes,"I pre-ordered this item about 3 months ago and very excitedly received it just a week ago, only to find that the first disc, supposedly containing 13 episodes, only contains 10. It is missing ""The Loaf"", ""Tuck's Love Day"", and ""Six Strings to His Bow"". Not only that, but the rest of the remaining episodes are out of order as written on the disc and the guide on the back, making it a bit confusing (they don't jive chronologically). I loved the first three seasons that Mill Creek put out, they did a wonderful job, but I wish I hadn't pre-ordered this one because of the quality of the others... apparently, since I have had it ""ordered"" for more than the 30 days return policy, I can't return it. I will work on this through Amazon, they are usually accommodating, but if you are considering ordering this Fourth Season, you might want to wait until they have worked the bugs out of their new release."
4,Robin Hood 4- great edition to collection,"If you like action & adventure in a classic sense, with swashbuckling & arrow piercing journey, then this 4th season of the British 1950's Robin Hood is for you. I have purchased 3 of the 4 seasons from Amazon and have found them all to be entertaining and fun. My boys even love them."
5,Extraordinarily Beautiful Love Poetry,"Marge Piercy gives us a rare treat--sharing the poems that she and her husband wrote for their wedding. Poems in ""The Chuppah"" are among the most beautiful love poems that I ever have encountered. Piercy has made me rethink what marriage means, and how to celebrate all aspects of married life.Her poems about her relationship with her parents are hard to read without weeping. All the mixed feelings that come with challenging parent-adult child relationships shimmer in these poems.Her series of poems about underrated pleasures--sleeping with cats, folding sheets, etc.--make me remember to stop and enjoy the little things in life.Marge Piercy is one of the greatest poets of our time! This collection is not to be missed."
2,Not that great,"I bought stabbing westward because i heard shame on the radio and i thought they would be an ok metal band. WRONG! The only moderatly heavy song is shame, like only 2 more have actual heavy guitar in them, it takes all day to get to it, and then its done. Im just glad I got it at a discount. Stay away!"
3,Nothing Amazing...,"...pretty much sums up how I feel about this band. I burned their self titled album off a friend a couple months ago and thought they had potential but never fully utilized or realized it. Though it follows a more grungy, Nirvanish sound than their self titled, Wither, Blister, Burn and Peel is the same in that they always screw it up somehow. The songs always have some good ideas but will always fall short in some way or another. Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Amorphis (later stuff), Porcupine Tree and Mars Volta all make similar music that sounds alot better. If your a big fan of the bands above and want something to tide you over until one of them releases a new album, Stabbing Westward is worth checking out. Otherwise just buy those bands instead."
5,Above Average to Excellent,"After first listening to my roommate's WBBP CD, I became hooked on Stabbing Westward. Like others have written, if you like NIN, you'll probably like SW. WBBP is a good second album, especially songs like ""Crushing Me"" and ""So Wrong"". Although I do prefer Ungod out of all three albums, all three are great in general, so go ahead and buy 'em! :)"
5,"You speak of love, he/she doesn't","Do you want someone really badly and you have asked them out numerous times and they still turn you down? Here's what you do... Buy this CD and play them ""What do I have to do?"" They will tell you what you have to do. I swear I have seen couples break up and one of them still likes the other and the person who likes the other they wrote the lyrics down and sent it to the other person. It is such a cool CD. Gotta love it."
2,Pseudo-industrial at its worst,"I'll admit, I like ""Shame"" and ""What Do I Have to Do? but the rest of the album is pretty much filler and useless to me. Industrial? Heck no! I wouldn't lump Stabbing Westward with the likes of the late KMFDM, Razed In Black, the Electric Hellfire Club and Frontline Assembly. Pseudo industrial bands like Stabbing Westward and Gravity Kills give industrial music a band reputation with their poor attempts at sounding hard and angst ridden. Stabbing Westward would be eaten alive and spit out if they ever crossed the path of real industrial bands such as the Electric Hellfire Club."
2,crappy,this is good for stabbing westward fans but not for metal fans. This is metal but not as most fans like it. All the songs have some annoying vocal harmonies that dont fit the music at all! The music itself is really good and saved itself from getting 1 star. If you like screaming with singing vocals and medium paced industrial music get it. If you dont like the harmonic vocals but still want good industrial i recommend GRAVITY KILLS.
4,it is the best and i think that every one should buy the cd,"I think that you should be arested if you dont have this CD and your living in the United States, because it is a very good album."
5,Number 1 like a Mofo!,"This cd used to be my second favorite SW cd (number 1 was ""Darkest Days"") all that has now changed. This cd is so emotionally driven. There is so much passion in the music and lyrics; one cant help but sing along if they are feeling the same way as chris hall. ""Why"" is my favorite song off the cd. It is so emotional and I connect with it. It is sad that SW broke up; but Chris Hall will soon be back...""The Dreaming""WOOHOO!"
3,3.5 is my rating-- good not great,"Stabbing Westward are what I consider an ""average"" band. But mediocre isn't really the description because Hall's depression on most of his songs he brings. Though this isn't my favorite it's not bad. Actually if I wasn't so annoying of a grader this would be a four because it's always in one of those ""Sound savers"" logos. Thank God the new release is out because it just got to a perfectly reasonable price. Many of these songs are pretty cool, including the two singles, ""Shame"" and ""What Do I Have To Do?"". Aside, ""Sleep"" is some scary sh**. If you listen you will know. Even Chris's vocals sound in shock when he sings it. I still think Gravity Kills have more talent. Either it's just that or I like them better. I think it's that last one. Because I haven't heard as much energy as on GK's ""Alive""."
3,Not bad but not great,Stabbing westward finally hit the radio waves after the release of latter album Darkest days and got a lot of well deserved attention.Not to mention that the singles (save yourself and the thing i hate) sold pretty well by singles standards.But it seems they forgot about this album which although not quite as complete as the latter has some really good tracks namely What do i have to do and so wrong (Which is also on the spawn soundtrack).I wouldnt say its worth running around for but if you enjoyed darkest days you might just find a track or 2 on here that you like.
4,Great first album,"With two amazing chart topping tracks, this is sure to be a hit. 'Shame', and 'What Do I Have To Do' will be played on the rock radio forever, while the rest of the album is above average, I have still listened to it hundreds of times. For a while, I had two copies of this album in my 5 disc changer."
3,Interesting but leaves you wondering....,"From all I have learned, THE BUNKER seems to rely heavily on conjecture and dramatization--the information is almost TOO meticulous. In spite of that, it reminds very interesting reading most of the way. History buffs will not be disappointed by the read, although it should not be considered the definitive resource on Hitler's bunker life."
2,Review of The New Jerome Bible Handbook,"I am disappointed with the New Jerome Bible Handbook, it does not meet my needs for what I am trying to do. I am trying to have a greater understanding of the word of God and the passages written in the Bible without taking a formal course. The handbook would probably work better if I were taking a Bible Study course, but I'm not. The book doesn't have the details or commentary explaining specific passages written in the Bible. Since the handbook does not work for me I went ahead an bought The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, which has a great deal more historical background on both the Old and New Testament. I am finding what's written in the commentary interesting."
4,"who spies,who kills","I was very pleased to receive my selection so quickly and at such a low price.I was told that I would get an ""acceptable"" copy,so I was greatly surprised by the quality of the book. There was just a little wear on the spine, otherwise,it looked like it had never been read. Thank you for making this such an exciting experience."
5,Read this book! It will be hard to put down!,"A must read book! Author is witty and describes the characteristics of certain astrological signs precisely, and describes how to deal with them."
1,"If you're a fellow Sag, don't buy this.","So I open up to the Sagittarius section and find the worst surprise ever! Dixon-Cooper basically paints Sags as the worst people of all time. All we seem to do is have casual sex, run from commitment and hurt others feelings with our honesty. At least that's how she makes us out to be. This may just be Dixon-Cooper's style, but it's less informative and more critical. Trust me, I'm a Sag, we're always extra honest (and sarcastic). -_-' DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE A SAGITTARIUS!"
1,100% Scam,"Most of the information is totally out of date. I got letters returned in the mail, disconnected phone numbers and quite a few rejections for applying to the wrong places. I had one woman telling me that the program I was looking for hadn't been around in nearly 5 years. Grant Seeker Pro is not worth 2 cents in my book.Live and learn..."
1,This book is NO good!!!,"I want to start a small business and finish school,so I purchased the product GrantSeekerPro but all the information in the book is out dated. I never received any replies back regarding getting a grant or they came back with wrong address. The book was NO help to me at all. I was unable to receive a grant like the book and advertisement stated. I would never recommend anyone to purchase this book if they are looking for the same types of grants as I am looking for. ..."
1,Awful product!,"This is the biggest waste of money in my life! Be careful if you purchase this product as they will continue to charge your card after your purchase for ""ongoing service"" which is nothing! Don't be fooled like I was!"
4,Grant Seeker Pro is good,"Grant Seker Pro is a neat program. I have ordered other stuff on grants before, they were o.k. Grant Seeker Pro had everything automated, it made it easier. It's been a good progam so far. I haven't got any money yet but I am closer now than I was before."
1,A waste of money,This book basically just cuts down the Bible and discounts it as untrue. I threw this book away after looking through it.
2,Felt apart after a bit,"I had to get this book for our Program Analysis class. The content seems decent, although I am haven't read enough of it to say too much. The exercises were helpful, and difficult (or tedious). However, the book felt apart in the middle of the semester. Pages were falling off quickly, and I haven't even really read much of it. I really don't like books that breaks since then I have to spend a lot of attention at arranging the pages and worrying about missing pages."
1,Horrible Documentry,"This is a piece of trash, The movie did not even give 20% credible information. I was shocked when I seen how anti-Che the History network is, maybe they the 1% that this county is seriously hating more and more everyday. I hope they do better job or at least go bankrupt because if they don't tell the truth then it cant be called history its called Fiction like what is being taught in High Schools."
1,Very funny! Boring Cliche.,"Very funny, this is coming from the man who said to Felix Rodriguez: "" I am worth more alive than Dead to you!"" If you want to know who this coward bubbling sociopath idiot was just reading Exposing Che, and Un Mito O Realidad and Shadow warrior. All these other books come straight from the Source: His family or extremely biased admirers. He was so good at warfare that he got killed because he couldn't even lead bolivian campesinos who were on the left. the irony is he became what he hated most: A capitalist Icon."
2,a lot of not very interesting BS,"In '65, my dad was with the US border patrol when Che was stirring up trouble in Mexico. Operation Monkey's Butt he called the push to get this rat-bastard, but the CIA was two jumps ahead of everyone and chased him to Bolivia, I think it was, where the army caught him.Here was a medical doctor, a very good one, at a time when his people desperately needed one, but he turned to the Dark Side and let it consume him."
4,a well-made documentary,"Just finished viewing this documentary, and wanted to write a review to balance the four one-star reviews!The makers of this documentary succeeded in presenting a fair and even-handed portrayal of the life of Che Guevara. I went into it with a moderately strong bias against the man. (I tend to dislike revolutionaries, who generally seem to me brutal and narcissistic.) After viewing it, I am still not a fan, but I am more sympathetic to him than I was before. It's the kind of sympathy that comes from better understanding.Those on the Far Right will find this portrait to be too sympathetic; those on the Far Left won't like the filmmaker's refusal to make excuses for Che's brutality. Whenever you piss off both extremes, you're probably doing something right."
5,One of the great mind benders,"The pin, the fork, the skewer, it's all in here. So many mind bending puzzles to work through it'll take you years. Sometimes you can spend hours on a single page, but once you've worked it out you've altered your mind set to see similar combinations on the board. If you're going to be stranded on a desert island for some time, then take this book. No one telling you how to solve the puzzle, no clues, just down and dirty do it yourself. I like it! The great thing is, that once you've worked through all 1001 puzzles, it's been so long since you looked at the earlier pages that you can start all over again. The never ending book."
2,POOR QUALITY,"It is true, the pages fall out faster than you can use them. And the puzzles are not jumble like in a real game. For example, in a real game no one stops to tell you, ""ok look for an X-ray Attack""... and so the book is not helpful. Instead, I recommend- ""Sharpen Your Tactics"""
5,awesome! for practice,"wow! literally 1001 to practice with!with other tactics books, after a while the exercicesget memorized and thus becomes ""not so useful"" to practice with.But this one, there are so many that you can practiceindefinitely!"
1,"LOW QUALITY BINDING, DO NOT BUY","This book has the worst quality binding. Every page you turn will drop out. And the puzzles are categorized, making it too easy and pointless. When you're in a game, someone doesn't say to you, find the pin or find the x-ray attack. No, the themes must be jumbled for it to be of any use."
4,a wonderful entertaining educational little book,"diagrams of positions where you KNOW there is a combination, and have to find it. one of the best ways to hone this skill, essential to any chessplayer. this convenient book is great for travel or those moments when no board is available. solve all of them and id say you were at minimum a uscf expert.i am a uscf postal master."
2,Blah,"There are two things very wrong with this book. Number one, the binding is horrible. The book started to fall apart right away. Second, the answers in the back of the book are not always correct. Either the best defense isn't played or the best attack isn't carried out. I've worked with tactics books where the problems are checked with a computer and those books are much less of a headache to work with."
4,Your basic Tactics handbook.,"I very seldom give a flat-out endorsement to a chess book. But this is one of those times.I am a USCF Life-Master. If you want to get better, you have to practice tactics. This book is a fun, easy, doable way of learning your tactics. The problems are grouped into sections by theme and content. Spend an hour or two, once a week with this book, and I'll guarantee you'll get better. Many of these examples are so stunning, you are not likely to forget them.This book, and its companion ""1001 Checkmates,"" belong in any aspiring World Champion's library. Probably the most bang for your buck you will find here."
3,Has its Limitations,"I will go against the majority by saying some bad things about this book, and why I really have not gotten anything out of it.1. Small diagrams, descriptive annotation: other chess tactics books are much easier to look at and look up the solutions for.2. Seemingly Random Difficulty: from one problem to the next you never know how hard/ how many ply the solution you are looking for is. This is fine if you have the ability to solve it, but if you are like me and will never, ever be able to solve some of these, then you never know if you are just wasting your time staring at the puzzle (are you missing something obvious or is it a 5 ply solution!?). I greatly prefer tactics books that have problems organized by difficulty--you should learn to solve easier problems before trying to solve harder ones!"
5,Right on the money.,"This is the best chess book I have ever read. No bull, just page after page of diagrams to solve. Everyone knows that tactics are the soul of chess, and this and it's companion 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate are the best ways to sharpen tactical eye. After a while you will intuitively know what the right first move is and on top of it all it's extremely fun. I wouldn't recommend this to total beginners however, I would recommend getting Seirawan's Winning Chess Tactics first."
3,Could be better,"The concept is great, but sometimes can be misleading. The types of different problems are grouped into each individual chapter, so all the fork problems are grouped together. Of course, if you are in the pinning chapter, you'll be lead to find a move which will pin an opponent piece... This can be misleading, because although you will be able to recognize a similar situation when playing in a tournament, it will seldom be the same condition where the best play will be to pin a knight or fork a pawn and a rook.I agree this is a great book (specially for the price!), but only if sized to the circunstance. Another issue altogether is the crummy notation (give me a break...)"
2,I found bugs in this game - is it just me?,"I have been playing Word Coach everyday for over a month and I find three very annoying error. Did anyone else have these bugs.1. The EP does not go any higher than 59%. It moved steadily up and has stayed at 59% for the last three weeks.2. The word ""Abbot"" comes up every day almost every game I play for the last three weeks. I know what it means please retire the word.3. In Word Shuffle the target time is 3 minute but they end the rounds before that time is up. I have tried by holding back during the first round to see if it is 1 and 1/2 minute for each round and I ended up with 2.39 second.These are the three main bugs I have found. It takes away from the fun of the game.After playing this game for over a month I am getting bored of the game."
4,well worth it!,"I have no complaints. It arrived on time, was exactly how I expected it, and the kids have fun with it! Great game..."
3,Good Vocab builder,"I wanted this game when I first got my Ds but couldn't find it in the stores in town. I finally bought it about a year later. I like the game. Then again I like this type of game. I have many ""brain"" games. They have words that I haven't heard of or never knew their meaning."
5,Fun!,"Hey, for $10, I'm having a blast with this ""game"". It's a nice addition to my growing set of ""anti-aging"" video games to keep my brain in gear. I use it almost every day and every now and then a new game is unlocked. Some of them I really like. Others are a little harder to figure out at first (heck, who REALLY reads the directions?), but eventually I get it."
4,Big words,"I have always been a big fan of education and learning how to speak well. Word coach gave me a chance to make myself better and have fun while I'm doing it. The best way to learn is to do it while having fun and Word coach achieves that by providing games like FILL IN THE BLANKS, WORD STACK, and UNSCRAMBLE WORDS. Each game helps you to get familiar with new words. the game examines your current vocabulary level then helps to build that level up higher. With just playing 20-30 minutes a day it will help to build a great vocabulary. I also like it because I have my 9 year old son play it and he is learning new words while having fun. so it is definitely a game for all ages. The only down fall is the game does have problems with the letter recognition and sometimes confuses letters that you are writing. Other than that this game is perfect."
3,A great game but,"I have to knock off the 2 stars because there is not left handed option. There is a level/stage called ""Block letters"" Where the DS needs to be turned to it's side like playing ""Brain Age"" (1 & 2). And for a lefty like me, your arm overpowers the top screen and you can't really see anything so It becomes difficult to play. But since a lot of the levels/stages don't require you to turn your DS sideways, It's still 80% enjoyable."
5,LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!,"Great game for seniors like me. Great for long, short term memory. I am the reigning champion having beaten both young and old players!"
3,For the love of words!,As an aspiring writer this game was certainly created with me in mind. I love words and nothing is more exciting then learning a new word and adding to my vocabulary on a regular basis. I normally seek out my word fix by reading an endless amount of books but thanks to this game I have another way to feed my need for words words words. Not only that but it does it in such a way that your not aware your learning words instead your playing a game with words. Making it fun as well as educational. Now granted this game isn't for everyone but if you are a word-aholic such as myself theirs no better way to spend your time then with this game on the DS Lite.
3,No Results (Yet?),"Word Coach is one of those ""brain"" titles for the Nintendo DS. The recent trend with interactive gaming systems seems to be overwhelmingly ""how to improve your brain.""The purpose of Word Coach is to build one's vocabulary. They do this by playing simple games like fill-in-the-missing-letter and spelling a word quickly. The program charts your progress, and you are required to do a minimum amount each day and reach a certain goal before unlocking the next level.The recommendation is to do small amounts of this on a daily basis, rather than sitting down and unlocking a whole group of levels all at one time.The interface is simple and clean, though I did have a hard time getting the program to recognize whenever I was drawing a G or a Q.After playing this for a while, unfortunately I haven't detected any improvement in my vocabulary usage.It's a nice game, but it's not very fun and exciting, but it's a nice, ""brainy"" way to pass time."
3,Fun for wordies,"I suppose you could use this game for education, to help you remember what words mean, but it's easy to ignore the part where it gives you definitions. Mostly I enjoy playing the various kinds of word scrambles, find-the-missing-letter games, etc. It's a good time-passer for the word-inclined."
2,doesn't live up to name,"The games are fun - I do enjoy playing. But I bought this with the hope of increasing my vocabulary. Unfortunately, I know most of the words already. And my 11 year old also knows most of them, so I can't even say it will help my kids. Overall it was a disappointment as I was hoping for education as well as entertainment."
3,Warning: Worst calligraphy ever!,"I have not seen writing detection this bad ... well... since ever.Just try to write an ""E"" and see what happens.If I write the capital ""E"" it will pick it up as ""A"" or ""F"" Or ""I""The lower case ""e"" gets picked up as ""z"" or ""o""Even brain age had much better recognition this piece of ...This game might just frustrate the heck out of you!"
5,Great!!!!,"Expanding your vocabulary and having fun at the same time.... What could be better???? Nothing!!!!!Unless you have a very extensive vocabulary, you may not feel challenged but if you are the average Jane or Joe or even slightly above the average you're gonna like it.When I first got it, I played it almost everyday and I have noticed that unlike before when I read a book and came across a word I previously didn't know, I breezed over it. Now... Come across the same word having learned its definition and it is amazing what a difference it makes to fully understand what the author was trying to convey....Highly recommend this game to both children and adults!!!!"
4,"Good but not Great, with some limitations","This vocabulary builder works nicely with our computor system, and offers easy access for children wishing to build their vocabulary.It's drawbacks were not so much technical - there are plenty of options - as audience: most young children are so attuned to video games that even this rather hyped up approach fails to live up to the heightened images and excitement generated by the entertainment universe children readily gravitate to.Not for a child who stuggles, more for one who wishes to learn more, is already a good learner, and is not bothered by the lack of gimmicks and the usual plethora of game tie ins many children, sadly, demand from modern educational tools."
2,Fail.,"[...] While it might be useful to a foreign learner of English, with such ""useful"" advice as, ""A verb is an action word in a sentence!"", it has some deficiencies that limit it for both native and foreign speakers. Many of the games require you to know the meaning of a word in advance, otherwise you'll simply be playing ""guess which meaning is the right one"". That is not a good way to learn new words. It can be a good way to reinforce what one already knows, but that goes against the entire point. As a linguist myself, I seriously question this product.In addition, the process by which your abilities are rated is entirely artificial. Even scoring perfectly on many of the games (I already have an extensive vocabulary), I was rated as basically a simpleton in order to preserve the illusion that I am ""improving"".Not recommended. Language learning software has tremendous potential, but it isn't even hinted at here. In fact, it's made to look laughable.[...]"
2,Left-handed people avoid.,"Consists of various games to increase your vocabulary and general spelling. Good but not comparable to the general Brain training series as this amount of games are limited. Some games require you to turn the device sideways. As with other games this one however doesn't ask whether you are right or left handed and assume the first. It is therefore a real struggle to play a time based game with the information behind your writing hand. If you are lefthanded, avoid! This will only amount to hours of frustration."
4,IPod lite,"At the price (w/ rebate), it's a nice deal!Initial impressions:Positive:-Inexpensive-Functional-LINUX compatible!! (check out Rockbox!)Negative:-Slow upload.-10 GB is not actually a lot, especially if you like multiple genres and want data transfer capability.-Some loose plastic bits.-No support for other file types (I don't actually care).-Bulky design.-Lousy documentation.It's a decent external hard drive and player for a good price. Hard to beat at its price point."
4,"Good product, but doesn't last","I got it as a gift, but thankfully the giver was smart enough to get a waranty. This thing will fall apart fast. The lifespan of the headphones is 1 day, no more. Then the OS goes. The thing crashes every one in a while, but aside from that it is VERY good. It has a large amount of space, some what confusing, but logicly made controls, and a strong body. I want to see an iPod fall multiple times and show no dammage. It is large, heavy, not very aesthetic, has technical difficulties, and the volume doesn't go too loud. It is problem prone, but a great thing. Get it with a warantee."
4,Change your Jukebox to a RockBox,"This is great starter for any geek. By it's self the machine is good, with new Firmware it is very good. Go to http://rockbox.haxx.se/ and check out this site before you buy. @ $is almost as good as an iPod."
3,Great-if you're a tekkie!,"I've had this MP3 player for 10 months now and am not pleased with it, at all. First of all, one of my friends had to set up the files and folders and ""roots"" to get all my music properly archived. It skips around. It utilizes MusicMatch Jukebox (as if!).It's quite heavy and bulky. My hard drive constantly had errors on it. And, finally, the whole hard drive crashed on me a few months ago and is sitting in its original box awaiting the mailman to send it back for repairs. On the other hand.......it can hold goo-gobs of songs."
2,Not Good With Mac 10.1 or higher,"I bought it & It said it works with 8.1 or higher but it doesn't work with it . I spent a whole week trying to get it to work , but i heard its good w/ pc's. It sounded good with the preview songs."
3,"Consider the Archos ""Recorder"" Line Instead","I bought the ""Studio 10"" before understanding the Archos product lines. All their disk-based MP3 players look alike from a distance but there are some significant differences... The ""Recorder"" line has significant improvements in the LCD display (8 lines vs 2, this makes a huge difference), file navigation and manipulation (menu keys, dedicated on/off buttons), audio output quality, USB 2.0 support (""Recorder 20"" only, I believe). The ""Recorder"" line can also record MP3s via built-in or external mic, but even if you don't plan on recording much the playback advantages of the ""Recorder"" line are definitely worth the extra money. Firmware updates are available from Archos website, so be sure to upgrade your player after purchasing. I know this is more a review of the ""Recorder"" and not the ""Studio"", but it's important to know that a better Archos player is available."
1,Pathetic piece of trash!,"It constantly hangs. Shuts down for no reason. And its recording capability is so unreliable that if it does not hang randomly in the middle of the recording, chances are you will simply not find the file after the recording is done (the file's just not there!). I am quite a wired guy, so you can be sure my problems are not because I am digitally challenged. The Archos is a very poor piece of engineering. Period."
5,awesome!,"fast recording, good quality. I spent 2 months trying to find the best mp3 player. THIS IS PERFECT. a bit bulky. but worth it"
4,My Archos 10gb,"I've had my Archos now for about 6 monthes, and i has served it's porpose very well. I took it on vacation with me across the Atlantic and i ran out of battery power before i ran out of music. I also have used it as an additional HD with much success. I must agree with most everyone in the downfalls: Poor manual, and horrible headphones. As of now, i wish that i would have ""sprung"" for the 20 gb recorder as my 10gb is to small to hold all my collection, and it is miss a feature that i wish it had, the built in microphone. I also wish that it could be upgraded to USB 2.0 or firewire....Overall though i am very happy with it."
2,Good for the money....... until the hard drive crashes,"If your looking for an economical way to carry a whole bunch of music around with you, and be able to listen to it with pretty good quality, then this player may do. Don't try to do anything physical though, a little jostling and it'll lock up on you. The sound quality is pretty good, especially with some decent earphones. Download Rockbox firmware for a better interace and some cool new features. Also, be prepared to buy a new one every couple of months. Me and a friend of mine both bought this player at the same time. His lasted about a month b4 succumbing to a ""HD ERROR"" and mine lasted almost 6 months b4 doing the same thing. On the plus side I spent under 150 on the thing, and got a lot of use out of it over the past half-year. In the end, though, I would recommend shelling out the extra cash for something smaller, lighter, and more reliable."
3,Alright,"When it's not broken, it actually works pretty well. It's broken three times, though, in the time I've had it."
4,not a bad little contraption,"I've had mine over a year and half now. The first two months I had it, I returned it to archos because it would not boot up. They sent me another one and that worked very well for about a year of everyday use. Then sadly (after the waranty expired) the internal harddrive locked up... What to do, what to do?? Ripped it apart and swapped the microdrive with a Fujistu microdrive I bought at a local computer store. A bit tricky to pull out the drive, but a fun experience, especially since I went from 6GB to 15GB... also the new drive is rated to use less power so batteries last longer... A bit fragile not to be thrown around but if you treat it like a laptop its completely GREAT!!!"
3,Good for about a year,"Generally, I liked my Archos Jukebox 10. The operations were fairly logical and it was easy to transfer files and create playlists. I use the product almost exclusively at the gym. On or about the one year anniversary, I experienced trouble with the sound quality. There is an echo in the background. This happened out of no where. There was no precipitating event. The most disappointing fact is that I contacted ARCHOS technical support both via email and by telephone and NO ONE has gotten back to me. Let's face it customer service has become an oxymoron. If the batteries have worn out, I also wouldnt know where in the world to get new ones because they arent available on their website or Amazon's, where I purchased the product. This was been a very frustrating experience!!!"
2,Fragile,"I got my jukebox about two weeks ago. I've listened to it in my car and while walking I carry it in my backpack. After two weeks or average use, it broke. I am not pleased."
4,decent harddrive mp3 player,"good points:stores tons of mp3rechargeable batteryget the wired remote (i use the player much like i would a car cd changer only with lots more music)cost $200 less then the 10gig ipodbad points:heavy (can not really be used as workout player)not easy to navigate thru songs (so select folder you want to play before you driveoff see above)can be quirky at times (use norton disk doctor and speed disk every so ofter, this helps alot and makes changing folders much much much faster)"
2,Unreliable,"I've had this product form about 8 months now and I have to say it is completely unreliable. I have trouble sending music to it and constantly get a message about it not being able to connect, despite having updated drivers and everything. Now it won't turn on half the time despite being fully charged. Just today I was charging it and it finally turned on again, but now the whole screen is lit up and it won't turn off now. I sacrificed the weight so I can get one that holds a lot of songs, which it does, but it just doens't work well. Let's see if I can actually get them to respond and fix it."
2,Don't waste your money...,The features on this pen are stupid. Save your money and buy a Wacom Intous3 Airbrush Pen instead.
3,Does not fit my 2002 330CI,"According to amazon ""This product fits your 2002 BMW 330CI"" however it does not. It is clearly is a smaller diameter and is missing the ridge that the fuel pump assembly latches onto. I have no idea if it actually fits the other models listed but unless you are sure I would stay away. I'm not sure what star rating to give since it's probably a good pump for whatever it fits in, I think 3 would make someone think first before buying it and read the review. If the compatibility is fixed let me know and I'll remove this."
5,what a girl wants,dear discovery girli love reading the girl magazines. my teacher has them for our class to read. i love reading the new hair styles and looking at the cloths.i also like reading about what happened to some girls my age.i really want to start getting the magazines so i asked my parents if they could start getting them for a x-mas present.thanks for listening to me it is great to have someone to talk to.brianna dingman
2,Not too good.,"This magazine makes me feel like I should have these things for hobbies: Fashion, accessories, and the ""cool"" factor--DG is pop-starred instead of unique. Some of the accessories and clothes just aren't for our age--who needs to wear fake braids at 12?But the worst is that DG makes you feel like you must worship it. It is our lives, after all, not the business status of the magazine that DG should be focused on! I don't want to be tied up to DG with the ""do it like we say"" messages.There is the random article about new hobbies, and talented 8-12 year olds. But mostly it's taken up with the things we -think- are cool--but we need something new!!Instead, something more ""you-oriented"" would be American Girl--try it!"
2,Not worth your money,"This magazine is not age appropriate at all. It talks about boyfriends, dating, and other things that a magazine geared toward girls around 10 should not think or worry about yet. There aren't any really good articles, especially not ones younger girls would care about. I don't think the age should be 8-12, either, because all the 12 year olds I know think this magazine is very immmature. I'd go for a better magazine, and save your money on this one."
5,Discovery Girls Rocks!!,"This is one of my favorite magazines! In the august/september 2005 issue, I loved the articles on being confident and popular in a good way. The popular article tells you how to get everyone to like you and want to hang out with you without being mean to anyone. In the newest issue, there were some really cool hairstyles and an article on Aly and AJ. I always like all of the celebrities that are in DG. There was also an article about a lot of high-school girls and what they wish they knew in middle school. I'm almost 12 and I have been reading this magazine since I was 8. All of my friends like it. This is the perfect magazine for girls that are to old for American Girl, but too young for Teen People."
1,Never recieved a single issue...,Ordered via Amazon ~11 months ago..Never recieved a single issue..Cancelled it a while ago..Got no reply or information back from the publisher or Amazon..Expecting some communication..Really disappointed in Amazon and the publisher..Hoping for a refund...Sorry I wasted the money and the time..
2,Age subjects topics not interesting,"Somewhat disappointed, this magazine is for 8 and up and my 7 1/2 yr old is not that interested in the topics covered."
2,Not the right age,Probably a very good magazine but I misjudged the age group that it is targeting. My 12 year old doesn't really find it helpful or engaging.
2,subscription,"Ordered this subscription July 31,2009 and as of September 12, 2009 she still has not received a magazine."
5,Awesome!,"I saw this at a friend's house today, and it is awesome! The only reason I looked at Girls Life was becaues people said that this didn't have celb stuff. That's a lie! This is one of the best mags I know of. You could be a model for it. You could be in it. Maybe you could even work for it! This mag deserves way more than 5 stars. It should be for girls 8-16, if the 16 year old isn't that into fashion, makeup, and boys. I want this mag.As of now, all my reviews have this at the bottom. It shows that it's by me. It's my logo.~~!!!**"
3,A Little Young,"This magazine appears to be directed toward ages 8-14, but is a little young. I'm 12 and a half, and no one my age likes this magazine because the fashion tips and advice are more relevant if you're 9 or 10. If you are 9 or 10 this is a great magazine for you. Some girls my age read like Seventeen and CosmoGirl, which are really for older teens, but Discovery Girls is too young. So if you are in like 6th or 7th grade and are 11-14, this magazine isn't for you. A good alternative is Girl's Life Magazine."
2,not appropriate for 8-10 year olds,"I don't think that the age range is correct for this magazine. What 8 year old is concerned about boyfriends and popularity issues? Furthermore, it is shocking that so many ""girl"" magazines focus on nothing but fashion, boys and looking sexy. Some of the girls photographed in this magazine are being made up to look like women already.Why does our society have to keep pushing girls to grow up so fast. They have the rest of their life to worry about boys! The sheer innocence of childhood should be deeply valued by society not rejected. However, the magazines have to make money, don't they? Yes, and they keep making money by indoctrinating girls into thinking that being sexy and catching guys are the most important things in life. It's too bad that parents keep buying these trashy magazines thereby perpetuating the cycle."
4,My Point of View,"I think Discovery Girls Magazine is a very very exciting magszines for girls, especialy 10 year old girls like me. I love it, and so do all my friends. I think it is very good because it tells you fashion tips, the latest fashion, stories from other girls, and much more things girls love, plus it is all new! Though I love Discovery Girls magazines, and I think it is one of the best magazine ever, I can not say it was the best because some things are not true to my class. That is so, but I still adore Discovery Girls Magazines!"
1,PERFECT For 8-11 year olds,"I'm 13 and i think that this magazine is the ""grown-up"" version of American Girl but is still too babyish and boring for preteens, so 12-15 year olds try Girl's Life,it's sooooo much bettter!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,haven't recieved a magazine,it is june ordered in April so until I get a magazine hey get only 2 stars for being slow
1,7-9,"im 11 and this magazine covers everything i thought about when i was 7. the 8-12 year-old range is totaly wrong. If you read this and agree, try Girls life or a ""teen "" magazine."
5,DISCOVERY GIRLS...goes for the GOLD!,"Looking for a gift idea? This is it!!! Brilliantly conceived, and done with a totally COOL, colorful, upbeat layout. Discovery Girls Magazine is the result of one Mom taking the initiative to honor our young daughters by creating a magazine for them. It asks for and publishes THEIR brilliance, their thoughts, opinions, ideas, writing, artwork, and personal stories. (A Creative Writing teacher's dream.) By also answering a thought-provoking questionnaire, girls are chosen from across North America, to be a part of the magazine by being IN the magazine! How cool is that for raising self-esteem? Motivating, educational, interactive, and advertisement-free, Discovery Girls Magazine gets the GOLDEN AWARD OF EXCELLENCE from me!(Gift subscriptions ideas: daughters, children's friends, young relatives, classroom teachers, local and school libraries and children's hospitals.)"
1,"Written by perfect girls, for teens","I ordered this Magazine 2 years ago. Now, I hated it! In the funnies section, all the things that were funny mentioned ""Cute Guy"", ""Crush"", or ""Boyfriend"". I don't think that girls (Including poor innecent 8 year olds) should read stuff about make-up, and boyfriends. Also, in one issue, it said ""Parents pressure you to grow up?"" I laughed at that. You're reading this junk! They're actually preussering you to grow up! DUH!!!!!!! Also, I have a huge problem with the girls on the cover. Straight teeth? Bright Blue eyes? Wavy silky hair like on the Hair product commercials? If you don't want something like that, just get American Girl instead. Do the right thing.Written by American Girl reader, age 10."
3,Its Okay....,"Discovery Girls is an okay magazine...but it is WAYYYY to stereotypical. THe magazine was written for pure girly girls who only care about fashion and boys. The other thing that ticked me off is they put super cool stuff you can buy in their magazine, but they are hard to find. When I want to buy one of the items, I always have to go on a wild goose chase to find one. And the sports articles are waayy to boring. If you want to get cool stuff you can actually BUY, learn about real girls who don't care about fashion and boys, make fun crafts, and do fun stuff, then please, subscribe to AG and save yourself."
3,Good Magazine but a couple things I dont like,"I am 11 and i have been reading discovery girls magazine sence i was eight. I think I am getting to old for it but I still enjoy it. The stories and the advice columns are good but I do think the magazine is too stereotypical. They only think there are two types of people ""girl girls"" and ""sporty girls"". The discovery girls they pick are pretty much picked because of looks. The don't pick any ""ugly"" or not skinny girls. I don't think thats right."
1,shallow at best and only for 12 and up (not 8 as it says),"Other reviewers are explicated very articulately what is wrong with this magazine. The focus is on popularity, crushes, and fashion. The girls presented in the magazine are heavily done up in the photos. The advice is fairly ludicrous and the embarrassing moments section focuses almost exclusively on ""crushes."" Also, the DG Girls featured in each issue (who range from ages 9-12 and are supposed to be ""real girls"") all wear heavy makeup and heavily styled hair. For me - this is the absolute opposite of the image I want my daughter to model. Additionally, as other reviewers point out - this magazine is chock full of ads.I cannot imagine what makes the publisher think that it's okay to market this type of stuff to anyone, but especially kids 8 and up.I was sorry when my daughter picked this up at the library - she loved it and so we checked out a few copies - after reading them, I am not impressed and we will not be subscribing."
5,Healthy perspective & Age appropriate,"The articles are helpful and relate to real-world experiences girls this age are having at home and school. It has helped my daughter understand what her friends (some going through divorce, etc) might be going through or why they might be acting differently towards her when she doesn't have the same experiences with which to relate. Glad to have this available for an in-between age!"
4,Can anyone lend me to 80 pound rats? I wish to rid my house of cats!,"Nana Quimby has a problem. There's a cat up a tree. So she calls the fire department, but they won't help - and when she looks again there are MORE cats. So she calls various other institutions, ranging from the sensible (police station) to the absurd (library), and finally city hall. Every call results in more cats stuck in her tree, until eventually she gives in and rescues them herself.And when the whole city calls about the mice infestation... well, let's just say that turnaround is fair play and leave it at that. Sweet book, and a bit silly as well."
5,Love it!!!,"This is a delightfully whimsical book with colorful illustrations and rhythmically-flowing dialogue. I add various tones and vocal changes when reading it aloud to my young daughter (who is enthralled by the story and quite absorbed in Nana Quimby's dilemma!) A joy for all ages, a classic to be treasured throughout generations..."
1,very disappointed,"Just received first book. What a disappointment and waste of money! The recipes aren't anything most advanced home chefs would even prepare. The description of the book and reviews were a little misleading and it is definitely not geared towards the average chef at home wanting to make sophisticated, yet simple meals. Recipes a little over the top for the home chef. I wouldn't waste the money on this magazine/book if your a home chef looking for new ideas or recipes."
4,Beautiful,"This is a very nice periodical. It's only suitable for the culinarily adept and adventurous if you plan to use it, but anyone can enjoy the beautiful photography and above par design."
4,Expensive but pretty cool!,I was looking for a magazine that had interesting food combinations and that showed lovely pictures of the finished product. Though i think some of the recipes are just plain rediculous (creamy risotto with edible gold anyone??) i think its a neat magazine. The presentation is also great! its HARDCOVER and the pages are big and glossy. It truly is a cool publication and i look forward to making some of the interesting dishes!
3,Not bright enough to be used for Christmas lights.,I am tried this lamp over the Christmas but to my disappointment they were too dim. You could barely tell they were on.
3,OK,"The product arrived and the battery in side was already dead. It came with an extra so it wasn't a big deal.The calipers feel a bit flimsy compared to others I've used.Over all, an OK product for light use."
4,Get an extra battery,"this caliper works fine, doesn't show fractions, only decimals. the battery only lasted for about 20 minutes use. Other than that is a very handy tool for right-handed people."
3,Ok,"I mean you know its fairly bottom of the barrel based on price. Just be careful with this, it's fragile."
3,Make sure you read the description of this 10/100/1000 switch,"I bought this under the mistaken impression it was a gigabit switch ... it sort of is, but not exactly: this switch has 24 10/100 ports and 2 10/100/1000 ports. I want a fairly large number of ports that are gigabit (1000) and this item only has two.So long as you know what you are buying you will be fine with this product. If you want more than 2 gigabit ports this is not what you want."
3,Not as Advertised,Item is not as advertised. Only two out of 26 ports are Gigabit ports. 24 are standard 10/100 ports. Read carefully. I sent it back.
1,Misleading title,"The 8 and 5 port switches are all gigabit, but the 26 port only has 2 gigabit ports, and the rest at 100mbps. This isn't very clear when you come in via the 8 or 5 port switches. I bet it is a great product otherwise but this is bunk."
1,Misleading Product Name,26-Port Gigabit Switch? I thought it was a great deal until I received it and found out that it's really a TWO-port Gigabit switch with 24 slower 10/100 ports! That's misleading.
3,cheating?,"combining 5 port, 8 port and 24 port swtiches review into one big section is incompetence at best, and cheating at worst.please separate them. I was looking to buy, now I won't because I wonder if Trendnet manages the reviews here to get such high rating?"
4,Great home switch,I bought this to replace 5 4-5 port switches I had accumulated over the years. I like this because it has the 2 1GBs ports for a couple of servers but isn't as expensive as a full 24 port GB switch. I can now stream from my home server without the hiccups I had previously encountered. It is quite small and quiet for a 24 port switch.
3,Gigawhat?,"Ok, this one is 100% on me, because the item CLEARLY states that it is a 24 port 10/100 switch and oh, by the way, it has 2 ports for Gigabit Ethernet. When I say clearly I mean clearly off to the side. Oh sure, the main product name is a 26-Port Gigabit Switch even though 24 of those ports are not Gigabit.Just remember folks, reading is fundamental. Of course, if you are reading this review, the odds are you already read the actual product description. If you didn't read that, you didn't read this review, and you are looking at a Switch and going ""Why are only 2 ports Gigabit? That isn't much of a switch..."""
3,It's okay...,I really don't know what to say. I was expecting more. It looked way cooler in the picture.
5,Where our technological living began,"Hard to put down, easy to follow. Provides the details we have been missing. Brings the history of electricity together, and gives each inventor his due recognition. Amazing to see the relationships."
2,Great and Not So Great,"As an mp3 player, it is great, as long as you do not run with it or speed walk. When I used it while speed walking, there were hard drive errors after 30 minutes and 36 minutes the two times I used it. When I used it while running, there was a hard drive error after two minutes. At that point, I returned it."
1,I spoke too soon,"Well, I should have waited another week before reviewing this product. My last review was praising this MP3 player.This review is a complaint.After only 12 days the hard drive has frozen up, with no way to retrieve any of the information. I didn't bump it or drop it or hadle it rough, it just zonked out.I wasted about 30 hours total, getting all my CD's out, decoding and creating playlist files and burning the CD's to this machine and now its all gone. I have to start over. I'm going to see if I can reformat the drive and see if the machine isn't a total loss. If that doesn't work I'm going to return it.Just keep your receipts and warranty information in a safe place, you might need it for this MP3 player."
5,Great MP3,"This has to be the best MP3 player/record on the market. It holds my whole CD collection and is very portable. I also have the PSA-PLAY 120 by Nike, this is a great compact player but it doesn't have the ability to hold too many songs not to mention whole CD's. I paid 259.99 for my Archos player/recorder and love it. I'm recording stuff on it right now...Metallica, Adam Sandler,Howard Stern, some pictures,a short video and a couple of files for work on Monday. What other MP3 Player can do that and its the size of a walkman. The other jukeboxes on the market are just like CD walkmans. What would you rather carry a cd size walkman or a cassette size walkman. And you get 2 sets of 4 of very good rechargeable batteries. This is the best MP3 Player/Recorder/HardDrive and ITS TOTALLY PORTABLE.....If you're looking for a MP3 Player/Jukebox get the Archos 10 or Archos 20 Player/recorder. BUY YOURS TODAY, I LOVE MINE..."
3,Programmer Mediocrity,"Think about it: 10 Gigs of wonderful music. When you turn the thing off, it forgets where you were! Next: navigate to the playlists (which you have to create using MusicMatch and then hand-move it to the Player), try and remember which one you were listening to, and then find the song you left-off at. How WONDERFUL!You get the MusicMatch player, and it comes with an Archos plugin. Which doesn't work!!! Contacted Archos Technically-challanged Support. Their response: ""Just hand-copy the files to the drive, it'll work just fine!"" Yeah, normal Programmer mediocrity of today. ""So what if it don't work... you own it. Wait til ya see our NEXT player!""If you buy it, plan on doing a lot of your own work by hand. If it doesn't work right, plan on finding your own work-around. Hey, other than that... it's an average product, really!"
2,too delicate,"In theory it's a great gadget but it breaks so easily!We bought three of those for last Xmas and the three of them are now defective, one in the display, the other in the batteries compartment, the third gives and error while playing.The headset that comes with it hurts after 1 hr or so or wearing it."
5,Very good product,"This machine takes a little understanding of MP3 file conversion, but a wonderful product. I put all my audio books on, total of 62, and still have a lot of room for music, and even computer data. Works as a removable hard drive for photos and data. Good product."
2,Not as good as an iPod,"Both the iPod and the Archos Jukebox have 10 GB and are rechargeable, but the iPod beats the Archos Jukebox in several key areas: size, battery life and transfer speed.SIZE: The small and compact iPod is so much easier to carry around than the Archos. The damn Archos barely fit in my pocket.BATTERY: Compare the stats. The iPod has a longer battery life.SPEED: The worst thing about the Archos, besides its chunkiness, is the slow USB connection. The iPod has an ultra fast Firewire connection allowing you to add several GBs in minutes. The Archos takes over an hour to load the same amount of music via USB. *Note: the 20 GB Archos comes with Firewire, not USB.I returned the Archos Jukebox after a couple days because the the above reasons. My Apple iPod works great on my PC too. I use the Xpod Windows software at work and iTunes on my Mac at home."
3,Heavy!,"I sold mine after a few weeks. I found I was using my Rio 500 with 128mb and not wanting to use the Archos because it was too heavy. The Rio I can just put in a shirt pocket and have it with me all day, no problem. The Archos would be like putting a big lead weight in your pocket. Also, the lettering scrapes right off, at least it did on mine. Sound is excellent, and if you want to carry a heavy mp3 player that can hold tons of music, this is for you. Personally I like my Rio 500 much better, and if I want to have alot of music I can use my mp3 cd player and bring cd's."
1,Track Ordering,"This otherwise excellent product has one major deficiency. You can not order the tracks using the MP3 track number. You can only order tracks alphabetically, randomly, or with a playlist.I own a number of CDs such as musicals that must be played in the original track order which is part of the MP3 file tag information. Can you image watching the scenes of a DVD movie only in random or alphabetical order? Why should I be forced to create a playlist or hack up the filename just to force this product to play the tracks in the correct order when the information necessary to do so is already in the MP3 file?ARCHOS customer support has been unwilling to even consider this as a defect in their product, suggesting instead that I solve their problem by prepending the MP3 filename with the track number!"
5,Enchanting description of its time,"The original was written in a more verbose, baroque style. This translation sometimes splits up sentences so as to make the stories more readable. The ten stories are told within another, which has some interesting details in itself."
3,Questions and Answers,So I needed this book for lab and didn't feel like I really needed it.Mainly questions and answers without any experiments or labs even.Pictures aren't colored which made identifying some rock layers difficult.But it was a great great deal and it kept it's resell value.
3,ok. but not as good as advertised.,There was a lot more writing in the book than expected. It did get to me in a timely manner and no pages were missing.
5,Simply one of the best out there,"This graphic novel isn't completely true to the book, but who cares?! This is one of the best of novels out there!? It's a great storyline, and I love how the Character change and development with everybody, plus you really get to explore the Predators. I really have respect for those artists . Thanks to the Father and Daughter who wrote the boo, so they could make that awesome comic! The art is terrific!"
2,Nails are crap,These nails have got to be the most worthless nails I have ever used in a nailer. No strength at all. Don't buy.
5,The Lion In Winter,"The film is made more memorable by listening to the outstanding score, written by James Goldman. The score evokes memories of the scenes in this excellent film and is well suited to the film."
3,Disappointed,There was one particular piece of music I wanted the CD for; it was a major piece in the film. I don't know the name of it. It was missing from the CD. I was very disappointed. It made the CD less grand.
3,Works - but has some rough edges,"Prior to Portable Vault (PV), I used CruzerLock from SanDisk. CruzerLock is a nice program but not Vista compatible.Compared to CruzerLock: PV is significantly slower. Copying 1 file, even a large one is OK, but copying many files, or moving files between folders within the vault is much slower.Creating multiple new folders within the vault is harder than it should be.Also, I like to copy and paste multiple files at a time. But PV only supports drag and drop. I find this awkward to have to keep both Win Exploer and PV open at the same time.Some of the built in commands, like Add, do not default to the last used directory - a nuisance.PV only supports 1 user/password. CruzerLock allows for multiple users - each with their own password.BTW - Tech Support advised me that while PV will work inside Vista, it must be installed from within an earlier OS."
5,Awesome Product,"I've been using Stompsoft products for quite some time and have been happy overall. I have to say that this one is my favorite. I travel all of the time and being able to encrypt my portable media is critical. This is the only software I'll use to do it. It's easy to use, works well and is inexpensive. Definitely recommend."
5,Biozyme,This product is a five star and above because you can't run a good healthy salt aquarium without it. That's what i would tell people.
1,Attracts dirt and grime,"This case got dirty pretty quickly and the clear whitish plastic did not disguise that dirt at all. I also couldn't clean it off, so I guess it just discolored. The case itself fit the phone fine, but it looked so disgusting that it was embarrassing to use. I ordered the Cruzerlite case to replace this one and was very happy with that choice."
2,"Cheap feel & look, but it works","The BAD:This has visible lines running lengthwise with small bits that apparently squeezed through the mold. The one I received also had colored grease (or something) on it and required cleaning prior to using. The plastic material it's made from also picks up color from whatever it rubs on - After a few hours in your jean pocket, it will have some blue marks on it.The GOOD:It fits snug and holes line up appropriately.For the price I paid, I expected better quality control and materials. Unless they drop the price to less than $5, you should probably move along, as there is no way they pay more than $2 to procure this from China."
3,It's White..it's not for me,"I liked the idea of having a white/clear back case since my phone is white. I was a fantasy to think I could keep it looking white. I had it for one day and it was already dirty and some marks haven't come off. I have a black purse and kept it in this phone pocket. The edges are dirty and it is very hard for me to keep it clean. I have kids also so...white was not a good choice for me. I have to get a colored case now because I can't handle having a dirty case. It may work for others. It does fit very well and had no issues with fit. It is tight on the phone. The back is a hard plastic, not grippy."
4,Good Case,"The case is slim and does cover all the sides and seems pretty sturdy without all the bulk. I like the fact that it has a see through cover on the back. It does lift the phone slightly so the camera lens is protected if you set it down. The on/off switch and volume toggles are completely covered by the case and you can still work them with a little more pressure. The only reason for four stars is that the cut out for the speaker on the back does not line up perfectly although it does not affect the performance at all, just aesthetic. I love the white color."
4,Pretty decent case,"I wanted a case that would look keep a sleek sexy look to the phone. It does! I have now had this case about a week and I am really liking it! The first few days absolutely fantastic! Beautiful, provides protection (Has a lip so I can set the phone face down without worrying) and also covers the camera so I can put it down without scratching the camera lens. However, yesterday while I was at the park I had the phone in my pocket with my cleaning cloth. Well it had rubbed off on the case. I tried to get it off with cleaner, it smeared! Now, near the power button, it is slightly pink. I am worried that this will happen with any type of residue that gets on the case. Only time will tell... but for now, it earns a fair 4 stars"
1,Discolored in less than one week,"I really wanted to like this case, as it was one of the few I could find that would still show off my white HTC One X. Unfortunately the white on the case became extremely discolored within just a couple days. I wear dress pants to work and it appears that the discoloring is a result of keeping the phone in my pocket. The clear back was also slipperier that I thought it would be...think plastic binder slippery."
3,Not exactly as pictured.,The case didn't have the BoxWave logo on back and the speaker cutout hole doesn't align vertically with the speaker
4,Great Product,"Good quality, all the pages are clean and in the right order. Wish it would have gotten here a little sooner but that's okay."
3,The small miracle,I first saw the original film years ago and as far as i'm concerned NOTHING beats the original. I HOPE the film will be put on dvd and on sale here on amazon.comThis version is a very poor sub for the original 1950's film called 'Never Take No For An Answer'. PLEASE get the original film on dvd. LOVE it!!! If the original is for sale on here all my birthdays will have come at once. The film is FANTASTIC.
1,DVD not worth the purchase,"I thought I was purchasing a movie in the sixties named ""never say never"". Not even close very dissatisfied with this DVD. Would not recommend it at all. Wasted my money and time in viewing it."
2,Laughable,HDMI connection will connect however it will not connect to your DVI line. Don't bother with this product the power slot for the DVI connection is too small and will keep you from plugging it.
1,Could not use it,"I can't use this item, I don't know if it was DOA or I simply miss understood what it was helpful for."
2,Did not work for me,"The connector was in good shape and attached to the DVI and HDMI connectors just fine.However, the adapter was so wide that it blocked the use of adjacent HDMI inputs on the TV.Make sure that you have enough room for this product. Buy a cable with HDMI and DVI connectors if you aren't sure."
1,Fell apart after a month of use,"Do not buy this item if you plan to use it continuously. It fell apart after about 2 months of use (50 plug-in plug-out cycles). It worked well originally, but soon the HDMI part of the adapter started bending and eventually fell out."
5,Good product but unexpected slow shipping,The product works fine but it took 3 weeks to arrive on a posted 5-6 shipping.
5,Works great and is cheap,"The adapters I saw in the store were $20 more expensive and I needed a few of these. Work fine, am happy with the purchase."
4,Works fine,"TrippLite is a good brand with quality stuff. Was exactly what I had need but I'm sure I'll find a use for it someday again. The problem was that it got wide so quick and plugged up with the neighboring cords coming out of the back of my computer. If you were using this with a laptop, it would probably work fine depending on your model.I would recommend this although make sure you have enough room on the back of your pc for a plug that get really wide really quick."
4,"Works, but very bulky.","Works well and very cheap. But if you have other ports close to the hdmi port you are plug into, it might hinder access to them. I suggest buying one that has a wire between the two interfaces so the hdmi side is separated from the bulky dvi side."
3,"Good Info, but Beware","This video was very well done and effectively conveys the terror felt by African-Americans after the Civil War. However, be careful in who you allow to watch this video--it's very graphic. Everything is reenacted, from hangings to conversations, to riots. I bought it to show to my high school students so they would understand just how terrible Reconstruction was for freed slaves, and I believe it got the point across, but I think it was too much."
1,One sided viewpoint,"Forgive me if I don't insert the obligatory appology for the institution of slavery because I'm a ""white"" Southerner. If this is your only source for the history around reconstruction then every Southern ""white"" owned or strived to own slaves, and then brutalized and murdered them. Also in their spare time Confederate soldiers ran around in the woods murdering indians. It wasn't enough to destroy Southern property, the economy, families, and culture, apparently every Southerner should have been executed without trial. They were all (including women) blood thirsty murderers, rapists, sadistic devils! The authors of this must have a deep hatred for Southern ""whites"". What is the word I'm looking for? Oh yeah, RACIST!"
1,Terrorist organization?,"The Ku Klux Klan was an organization designed to put forth the rights of white Americans. One of its major functions was to intimidate the white dead beat husbands, whom abused thier wives and children and whom would not take care of thier families. How quickly the media forgets that aspect of the Klan. If the Klan was half the size it was in the 1920s, social services such as DFCS wouldn't be needed..."
1,Beyond the Civil War,I was dispappointed with this video because I thought it was a story not a documentary.
5,Get it ? Got it? Good!!!,"The title of my review is the chorus of the 3rd song on the CD, ""Get It"", which is exactly what more people should do. Get this CD."
4,A Great Sequel to the Writer's Club,"As with ""The Writer's club"", this book was a cozy, relaxing read. The characters are charming women and are so easy to relate to. There was a little less romance in this book than in the first, but there was plenty of mystery and suspense. I enjoyed it."
4,Mystery is Our Shadow,This book is a quick relaxing read. If you need and escape this is a good book for that. An interesting collection of characters and mysteries. Being a writer myself made me wish that I could find a group of writers like those four women to share my experiences with and could find homes and adventures to inspire my writing like theirs did.
1,Poor Design - Didn't Work Properly.,"This is the same case made by Krussel (must be same company). The major design flaw of this case is the inner cover that goes over the Handspring lid. This stretches over time very quickly (a few weeks) and then does not hold the lid at all. Therefore, when you open the case, this inner cover slips off and hangs unused and in the way. It became such an annoyance that I finally had to cut the inner cover completely off. Now, I have to open the outer cover - and then the Handspring lid to get to the phone.As a result, I have stopped using this case and have bought the ones made by Handspring."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Not only did I get ripped off for the free shipping for the item, it wasn't the advertised item. This case doesn't even come close to fitting the Treo 300!!! I strongly warn anyone from dealing with anyone associated with this product. What a waste of my time. I'm through with Amazon."
2,"Great Idea, Excellent Cast, Boring Results","A superstar passes away, and his managers/publicists/writers are unsure of their futures in the biz. If they can take a no-talent ""Blue Collar"" guy and transform HIM into a star, then their place in history is assured. Or somethin' like that - it's a novel idea. Too bad that Everett Sloan, Phil Harris, Keenan Wynn, Ina Balin, John Carradine, Peter Lorre, and Scatman Cruthers are saddled with downbeat dialogue and stilted direction. But there are a few hilarious scenes (his first rehearsal, his first club appearance, and an incredible Ed Sullivan self-parody)."
2,1960 you bastards,"Incase you were wondering, again. That's when this movie was made. AMAZON DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THE YEAR OF PRODUCTION ANYMORE -OR THEY ARE TOO friggin LAZY.I guess our money's just not goodnuff."
3,"Great box, terrible manual and interface.","Every high tech programmable gizmo has to have some kind of Enter (""yes"") key. Sometimes this Enter key is the ""Play"" button. Sometimes the Enter key is the ""Menu"" button, and sometimes Enter is one of the function keys. This interface is designed to aggravate.If you start to record, you won't be prompted with any chance to give the track a title. The last title will be used. You have to have the presence of mind to change the artist and title before you start recording."
4,hell yeah,"just think about having pretty much any cd you'd want to listen to in your pocket. stop drooling on yourself and read on.this thing is great. simple interface, batteries that you can recharge without taking out of it, removable batteries, a HELL OF A LOT OF STORAGE FOR [THE PRICE]!some drawbacks: random is not so good. you have to have everything in one file. further, you cant delete files without plugging it in to the computer. the recorder has serious limitations if you're going directly from analog. unless you're recording through your computer, it names every file the same thing (""new song"") so you have to disconnect the little [thing]and plug it back into the computer to rename the song before proceeding.still, for this price I CANT IMAGINE NOT HAVING ONE. actually, im going to be buying a second (i have a lot of CDs and records, and i'd like my living room back. all the uncompressed media is going into the closet for storage.)"
1,This thing is Junk,"I bought the Archos 2.0. New. It did not work; wouldn't turn on. Sent it in for repair (Archos has no 1-800 number, which means a long wait on your dime). Returned the recorder, at my expense. Weeks and weeks passed--much longer than the 10 days Archos represented as the average turn-around time. When the recorder was returned, it was 10, not a 20. Archos returned a cheaper model. Called them up--same routine: 35-minute wait. Answer was, ""We do not have any more 20 models. We can not send you a replacement.""If this type of service and product quality appeals to you, then by all means buy from Archos. On the other hand, if you want a recorder that works and has 3X longer battery life, buy a Sony."
4,so far it's great...,"I bought this unit to record my own playing [electric fiddle in a bar band] directly to MP3 format. I've not taken this unit on the road yet, but at home it works just as I hoped. Input is through a Sound Professionals preamplified microphone on the line-in channel...The usb interface to a mac powerbook [OS 9.2] works well and is an easier way to manipulate files than by sequential button-pushing on the jukebox unit itself.I have had the unit for about a week as I write this. I might upgrade to 5 stars after I get a sense of reliability.The manual, as others have noted, is not very intuitive, partly because the translation from French is a little ambiguous."
5,Dont believe the hype!,"Unless you are some brain dead creaton who struggles, repeatedly, with such technological challenges as a blinking VCR clock, this is the product for you. Granted, the instructions are virtually useless, but if you charge the unit for a minimum of 6 HOURS BEFORE USING (I know its hard, but if you dont wait, the battery life will be lousy) you should avoid any of the aforementioned problems. I have had my unit over 6 problem free months, I have over 2,000 different songs, from more than 250 different artists, arranged in 12 distinct categories, and the drive is not quite yet half full. Simple to use, but hard to fill, this is a Fantastic MP3 player."
2,Lousy Batteries,"If you dont mind spending more time charging the batteries then actually using the unit, then its a good device, but they dropped the ball with their special batteries. Advertised to last 8 hours yet only last 4 hours tops and takes even longer to recharge them. Dont expect good customer support either, they dont speak english very well."
3,READ ME!!!,"Before you buy this, understand that you are going to spend some serious time getting the hang of it. The ""instruction"" manual is garbage and the keypad that controls the functions could be much better. Whatever you do, make sure you click the icon on the bottom of your browswer to safely unplug USB cord from the unit. Failing to do so will crash the unit and the tech support folks take forever to answer.The good news: 20 gigs. That's a lot of music to have readily available wherever you go. The price is 1/2 of what the I Pod would run you. Once you do get the hang of the player it's great to have,"
5,It is what it says it is,Its heavy but I would not run around with a 20 gig harddrive anyway. I found it for a good price with rebates and so forth so be on the lookout for those. The mac wont withstand running around either-so what if it is a little bit heavy. It sits with me in my car on my computer anywhere I spend time. If I need to carry it(jogging) I have enough money left over to buy a real portable armband device or something.
2,User Interface (is bad),"have no problem with the MusicMatch Jukebox, or the drag and drop right to the Jukebox. Can't stand the way you navigate on the unit..it's going back tomorrow. Might be some trick to it, but the documentation is non-existent."
2,Big bad surprise,"1. 20 GB is not 20 000 000 bits, so forget you can store 20 000 000 bits of music on your 20 GB device. I do not remember exactly but it is like 19,4 milion bits. That was a first surprise :-(2. Second one was a recorder. I could not record using any external source, just through inbuilt mic (but forget using this one- you hear rather noise of hardisk than the sound you wanted to record).== I wrote to Archeos - email - long and polite - I included my date of purchase etc. - NO ANSWER from customer service departement!!!!!!!! (after 4 months still waiting it ...)I am not from USA, I bought it there but I live in the Europe now. Any phone calls and snail mail is very expensive for me.I threw my money for Jukebox -that is basicly good thing- but couple important details make Archeos Jukebox recorder 20 GB very expensive china garbage.Think twice before you buy it. Good luck."
1,poor quality control,"The Archos Jukebox is a great concept and I was very happy to order one. Unfortunately, mine was dead on arrival. From reading the newsgroups and the Archos Jukebox user groups I think the product has major build/quality problems. I can't recommend this product based on my experience. Also, the one year warranty has been reduced recently to 90 days, so buyer beware."
2,Look at other products first,"I do not like the Archos player at all. The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was the display... it is very hard to see. The back lighting is brown and with today's technology this is very antiquated. To move around within the menu is not intuitive at all. There is a music queue option but you can only queue one song at a time. While listening to music the buttons on the player do not work like a standard CD player. Example - when listening to a song and you hit the back button it does not go to the beginning of the song you were listening to but back to the song before it, so to listen to a song again you have to hit the back key then the forward key to get back to the beginning of the song."
1,Two Bad Hard Drives in 3 Months!,"The build quality of this product seems to be amiss. The first Jukebox arrived with a bad hard drive. It was returned and the hard drive in the second Jukebox went bad 90 days later, with very little play and zero abuse, i.e. it never left the house, was never dropped, etc.Also, don't expect much in the way of volume, it is just not there.Based on 2 bad hard drives in 3 months, there is no way I can recommend to anyone they purchase this product."
2,Beware of ARCHOS,I have purchased 3 different Archos MP3 Players and they all have 1 thing in common within a year they are broke. I like the features and the ease of handling with their product but the quality is just not there. The Studio 20 is a paperweight. The 2nd I gave away and the 3rd one Broke today. Their support is inferior and takes forever. The batteries constantly die out. Good product just bad engineering. Dont make the same mistake I did it will be a waste of money. I think I am going to get a IPOD
1,"...support, .... product","exactly 1 month after the expiration of the 1 year warranty, i upgraded the firmware and the jukebox could not boot up. i had enjoyed it for almost a year, with some annoying problems here & there (nothing major - battery life too short, original rechargeable batteries from archos were no good, losing data). i even upgraded firmware on previous occasions without problem.my big problem arose when i contacted tech support and was told repeatedly that it was a battery problem. it was not. upgrading the firmware somehow corrupted the unit, and i could not get it to work correctly to be recognized by my PC. in short, i spent several hundred dollars to use it for 1 year."
2,Flaky Flaky Flaky,"Okay.. I got this device in the hopes that it would merely do what its advertised to do.. which is *record*.. well.. being a DJ I wanted it to record long mixing sessions (oh.. like 3 hours worth).. Dont bother.. it will [shut down] mid recording, the display will lose its vertical hold (dont ask me how an lcd does that.. it just did). After 2 months of having it the batteries barely hold a charge, and there are many things wrong with the functionality.. like I cant turn it on while its charging.. I have to unplug the charger, turn it on, and then plug the charger back in.. grr.. Id expect a litte more than that for [$$$]."
5,Doesn't skip when running,"...I ran 2 hours last Sunday with my new jukebox and it didn't skip a beat. Just a little heavy, but lighter than a water bottle filled with liquid. I did use my own wrap around the ear headphones because they sound better, but the included ones were decent.I brought it to work and was backing up some files during a meeting using USB1. I downloaded about 11GB of my personal MP3 music on my home system with the USB2 and it took less than 20 minutes. Well worth the price."
4,Has Volume Control and Firmware Bugs,"...... It's so much cheaper than the iPod, and much smaller than the Nomad, I wanted to try it. I'm keeping it.The only downside that I've seen so far is that the thing ""crashes"" occasionally. It will display the wrong song, or do something else strange but not major. About once every 5 hours of use, I find myself shutting it down, and restarting it. Other than that, agree with the general benefits in other reviews..."
5,Awesome MP3+ player!,"Forget about the Ipods!This ARCHOS Jukebox will have Ipods for breakfast any day!I've had mine for a few months now and absolutely love it. I live overseas and I don't get to listen to any American radio stations... that was until I got this Jukebox. Now, the only thing I have to do is record Internet radio directly into my Jukebox and Presto! I have any good ol' US Radio Station that I want, and I can listen to it on way to work.I have a music (MP3) download engine on my computer and I can download all the songs that I want, organize them in folders, mix and match, or play it any way I like in my Jukebox with absolutely no problems whatsoever.I'm pretty sure there are some slicker players out there, but if you want the most bang for your buck go for this one!"
4,"Bad manual, decent product...","I've had this player for about a month, and like a lot of people, I've had some problems with it. However, now that I seem to have it working fine, I like it a lot more.TIP: If your computer has USB ports on the side of the case, or a USB hub, don't use them for this. Use the ones in the back.Also, if you need to call tech support, be prepared to wait a long time. The tech support people were very quick to identify my problem, though, and help me fix it, so once you do get someone on the line, just be patient and you should be able to get the player working."
2,90 day warranty - non existent support. Do the math.,"I purchased this product for my daughter for Christmas. It worked fine for two days and she loved it. Then it began sporadically making a grinding noise that was not normal. I sent an email to Archos support on December 27 and had not recieved any response by January 6, so I tried to call. After 25 full minutes on hold - I gave up and sent another email to support. Again, no response. I returned it and am now shopping for a replacement. With the short warranty and non-existent support - buyer beware."
1,Buyer Beware,"Sound quality good. Ease of operation fair. But tech support is a nightmare. Impossible to get on the phone and it's you who's paying for the 60 minute wait, after which you can't get anyone anyway. When you finally do get someone, they're not helpful. My unit had to be sent in before the warranty expired. Although there was nothing wrong with the playback they sent me a new unit and all the files I had recorded were gone. When I finally reached them, they were rude and bad-tempered. Stay away from Archos if you're smart!"
2,archos recorder,this unit does not record well with a mic under loud live recording situations. mini discs are better. instructions are completely useless. you can hear the hard drive on live recording play back even when file is down loaded onto pc and played back. good concept but needs improvement. built in mic does not provide good quality. you here the drive zipping away. back to the drawing board and listening room frenchy. if you build and sell the unit make sure it is supposed to do what you say it does. i am dissapointed!!!
1,Mac Users Stay Away!,"This is another non-mac product that they parade in our face as a mac-product. The manuel made the instalation sound simple. It wasn't. The instalation created conflicts all over the place and made my I-Mac crash left and right. Once I figured that out, the ""simple drag and drop"" doesn't work. The Tech Support line is not a toll free number. They keep you on hold. When they finally answer they speak poor English. They could not help me with my problems and I still have not been able to use the device. I'm so returning this item!"
2,READ THIS!,I have had this MP3 for awhile. It is not very easy to move around in and the buttons are not very well laid out. Holds a good amount of CD's. The provided headphones are not very good. I switched to the iPod and have never looked back.
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"Absolutely do NOT buy one of these things!!! I had mine for about 18 months and had no problems at all. Yesterday, I turned the unit on as usual and got an error message. I phoned Archos technical support (if you can call it that) and they told me that I had a defective hard drive on the unit itself. 20GB's of music lost just like that. Archos will attempt to repair the thing for $65 and shipping costs, but won't take responsibility for any data on the unit. Apparently, this 'just happens' sometimes..."
5,"Sceptic, but a pull through! even over iPod","I purchased my Archos Recorder 20 before I went on a long trip to Japan. I didn't have enough room for a bunch of CD's so I bought the JB 20 instead. At first, I liked the idea of not having to mess with CD's, but a little swayed by the weight of it. But the thing that aggravated me the most was the Archos firmware. It's slow and crashes.So I thought I would sell it and start saving up for the iPod which is twice the price. But just recently, my brother introduced me to Rockbox.haxx.se which is a site that created it's own firmware that speeds everyup and makes it well worth the price. The firmware is open source which means customizable, to some.My advice, it's well worth the price for the 20gig HD when compared to the iPod ..."
2,Great sound BUT..........,"Well, It has a great sound. I was very pleased with it after using it the first couple of days. The third day: After shutting it off, I plugged it in and charged it then it refused to turn on again. Until I came back home to the computer (which was awful since I was vacationing in the Caribbean and took my unreliable little device as my only music source). Needless to say I don't recommend the Archos!!! It costs too much money to be this unreliable."
2,Archos MPS Studio 20,This player is a great idea but it's a little difficult with the USB Interface. The player many times stutters or stops for a few seconds and then continues while listening to music. The USB connection to the PC is very slow when dowmloading music to the player. The USB interface is also very sensitive and can cause the player to not respond to the download. The best part about the player is that it can hold a large amount of music. Other than that it's average.
1,Archos just doesn't get it,"Overall, there were a lot of technical glitches, and the display is a major battery drain. I gave up on this after a couple of months and went with a Creative Zen, and am much happier. Archos is a French company, their service is terrible, and even though the device is sexy out of the box, there are too many problems for a device this expensive"
2,I have made copys of movies that looked better then this did!,When played with a DVD player it would not play right but once Played on a PC it worked. Picture quality is a 3 at best.
3,Film Does Not Date Well,"The film does not carry well over twenty-four years later. The basic story idea was good, but almost everyone plays a buffoon in the film. If it were remade today (hopefully) it would be a tighter, more intelligent script.Phoebe Cates got a bad rap in this film. She is sweet, beautiful and intelligent, and engaged to the lead boy. She loves this stupid kid, but he falls in love with an angel. Now the script takes a wrong turn and tries to make Phoebe a bad person because the kid broke her heart and she's pissed off at him. Duh.The film should have ended 5 minutes earlier than it did. But they decided to give it a ""Hollywood"" ending. Too bad.I give it 3 stars because of the scenes with the boy and the super beautiful Emmanuelle Beart (the angel) -- fast forward through everything else."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on!,"This movie was so ridiculous and stupid. I can't believe I watched it through to the end thinking maybe it would get better - well it didn't. I'll give to the local library. I didn't like the movie because the acting was poor. It was a B rated film. The angel didn't speak; but rather made weird noises/tones, then people would look at her and all of a sudden become quiet and peaceful because her gentleness somehow was cast into them. The friends of the guy that who found her were trying to kidnap her so that they could make money from showing her. I think I expected a love story, but this was nothing like I expected. I was extremely disappointed. I do not recommend this movie. As I said, a donation to the library."
1,What a bad movie!,"The other reviews for this movie looked good, so I thought I would buy it. I've ordered several other movies on Amazon - this one is the worst I've purchased. The plot was fair, most of the acting was average, but the Angel was terrible. That noise she made got on my nerves and it never got better. My wife and I tried to watch it and couldn't get over half way through it. This was a waste of time and money. Don't bother!"
4,Date with An Angel. This movie is unique and one of it's kind!,The quality is amazing considering the age of the movie and that was in VHF and republished in DVD.and thanks to amazon delivery was very fast.Thank you Amazon.Recommended to all.
4,Very cute movie!,Phoebe Cates is funny in this movie! It is a sweet love story with a twist. I recommend it. :)
3,countrydan,"I enjoy the song ""A Spaceman Came Travelling"", because to me it's the perfect song to be performed at Christmas Time"
1,Just a rehash of what's been in the magazine,This is a ripoff. I see what's budget about it. It was cheap for the magazine to create because it's just a rehash of what they've published before. This is a major disasppointment. Don't buy it.
3,Budget Living Subscribers: This is a pass,"As a subscriber to Budget Living, I would say that a fair amount of this book has already been published in the magazine. I haven't even read all of the issues I've received yet and couldn't help recognizing at least half of the photos and such when flipping through the book. I ordered it sight unseen, which I now regret. If I'd looked at it first, I probably would have passed because so much of the content is recycled. Shame on the editors for milking a good thing for all it's worth!"
4,neat,cool book but was expecting a little more. binding came apart fast.was still glad i bought it though.
4,"Still missing Budget Living Magazine, but this book helps fill the gap","So glad I found this still available for sale Amazon. I'm still missing the original ""Budget Living"" magazine, though. Especially in these rough economic times, Budget Living is sorely missed as a resource for the frugal lifestyle."
2,It's not cheap but...,"I don't know how they can call this ""home cheap home"". $1750 for an outdoor table & chair set? $450 for an orange lamp? $1400 for a red carpet runner? $1200 for a chandelier? I could go on & on.Plus most of the projects they talk about were done by professionals-things powder coated, reupholstered, etc. The book kept saying they had things done because it's hard to do yourself. Not what I was looking for.Over & over again they talked more about splurges-the book should have been called ""It's not cheap, but..."""
5,an action tale with a political and moral conscious,"This is an exciting, fast paced story with a surprisingly interesting look at United States foreign relations over the last quarter century. Two dashing heros, an evil villian and a government conspiracy. Great fun to read!"
4,Much better than other texts,"I have used this text in my College Writing class for roughly 4 years, and I continue to like the text overall. I disagree with some other views about the quality of the essays in the texts. The readings on argument are quite good, and they evoke discussion in my classes without prompting. I also like the fact that the text does not have a decidedly liberal bias. IE. They have one essay in favor of same sex marriage and one against it. The end of chapter prewriting activities are also good as are the peer review activities.What the text lacks is a section on annotated bibliographies, which my students have to write as part of their research assignment. It also lacks a good section on comparison and contrast; some sample essays would be essential in this area.Overall, this is a good text. It is much better than the dreadful Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing, which is written in a language that most college students do not understand."
3,unnecessary,i used this for freshman college english but it was barely necessary. it explains a lot of grammar rules that should already be innate in many college students. probably a good book for a foreign student though.
2,eh,"Great looking book, if I believed subjective english grading was worth wasting my time I would have opened it. But because I don't, I didn't."
1,i need my money back i did not get your products,"i have not recive the item,that i order in november. i have no way to get hold of you, please refund my money or cried it to me when i shope again with you. please respond????thanksmarta"
1,blatent lie,they said hard cover. i got the soft cover. completely useless. will never purchase from them again.
4,Useful for writing papers,"A lot of the examples in this book can be quite boring. If you don't know a lot of about editing, this is a good book to read through a couple of the examples. I use it for as a reference guide when I'm writing my Works Cited page. I often get confused on the difference for scholarly journals, web articles, and the various ways to list books."
2,mediocre,"As a post-secondary instructor of English, I find this text filled with ""commercial"" interuptions. The exercises in the first few chapters appear to be ""busy work"". On the positive side, the readings that were selected seemed appropriate."
2,BORING.,"As a freshman nutrition major, this book was required for my English 101 class. I found it to be boring, unhelpful, and plodding. The author's instructions for activities leave you depressed and annoyed, and teachers have to jump around a lot to instruct properly.This might be a good reference book, and perhaps even a book for secondary/high schools, but not for a college English class."
5,Awesome product!,This DVD set was bought for my boyfriend who is in the military and had seen the show on TV. He talked about it all the time. Now that he has it he raves about it even more. He couldn't be any happier. He say's it's one of the best military documentary videos he's seen. I even enjoy watching it because it explains and shows diagrams very well so even I understand what they are talking about. He can't wait to purchase season 2. Thanks so much!
5,A nice gift for any plane buff,"I bought this for my husband, a self-described ""plane nut."" He loves it! It has old footage of aircraft, and the show breaks down how various dogfights ""worked."""
5,My little men and big men LOVE this DVD!,"I bought Dogfights for my 3 grandsons ages 3 to 10 and they are absolutely glued to the TV when it's on. Their father and grandfather are right there with them too, not to mention my daughter and myself as well. The graphics and the stories are unlike anything you hear today. WWII vets are a dying breed and such a breed apart that it's inspiring to hear them tell their great stories of heroism, danger and tragedy. I love for my grandsons to understand a world that had men that were full of honor and self-sacrifice rather than a world of tattooed dope-head ego-maniac rock stars who simply follow a herd of pathetic self-serving fools.Love this DVD."
5,Thought-provoking,"I saw a mention of this book on Slashdot a week ago. When both Vernor Vinge and David Friedman recommend a book, it is a pretty safe bet that it is a good story and well thought out. I wasn't disappointed.The origin and purpose of the Shivas practically demands another novel. While I am not a big fan of series that never die, I'll be looking for that one. I hope that once again, the ideas are the best part."
5,"dazzling ideas, quirky characters & heart-pounding adventure","Earthweb envisions a mid-21st century in which mankind is engaged in a desperate effort to stave off destruction at the hands of robotic spaceships sent by a mysterious alien race. Sounds overly familiar? Not in the hands of a writer as inventive as Marc Stiegler. Earthweb begins with a fascinating extrapolation of how the world wide web can evolve to form the backbone of a global defense system. Then Stiegler throws in an unusual cast of characters and takes the reader on a good, old-fashioned adventure."
2,"Not very belieable ""realistic"" web story","This novel revolves around recurrent, regular attacks on Earth by an advanced, mechanical civilization. The aliens send destroyer ships periodically and the people of Earth desperately seek new ways to defeat them. The aliens improve their approach with each attack to counter earlier Earth strategies. The characters harness the WWW to devise strategies that go beyond the abilities of any single individual. The story is flat, the plot is dull, and characters are two-dimentional. Numerous obvious plot holes exist. For instance, detailed tactical commands are beamed from Earth to assault platoons that breach the alien ship. Split second reflexes are needed to defeat the aliens, along with innovative tactics. With the delay required for the Web consensus to develop and the transmission delays between earth and the alien ships, the commandos would be fried. If you have some free time, try a ""Star Trek"" re-run rather than this book."
5,Great!,"This spearmint leaf brand fulfilled my expectations! The delivery period was right on schedule, and my gosh, a pound of mint leaves is much bigger than I imagined. Good stuff."
5,Good Saw,I can't really write a review yet as I haven't used it yet. Bought it to replace one my husband ran over in his truck. Will keep this one away from him.
5,Excellent new saw from Makita!,"This new saw from Makita is an outstanding improvement over previous models. It has a much more substantial feel and the rubber grips are nice too. The baseplate is now made from cast magnesium which should make it stronger and add to its durability. The rubber grips on the depth and bevel adjustment levers are also welcomed, no more skinned knuckles trying to pry the old style loose. The fit and finish of this saw is also outstanding. The saw has as much or more power than any other sidewinder on the market. I'm not a salesman, just one who appreciates fine tools and this saw from Makita would make a nice addition to anyones tool bin."
3,makita 7-1/4 5007MG,"i had an old makita 5007 it was the most confortable saw and fine cutting, but this new saw 5007MG is heavy not well balance, did not like shape of base(table).the taper on base makes it hard to use with home made rip fence.PS the only bad part about the old 5007 was how easy the base bent."
5,Great Saw,I use this saw daily.Have had it for the past 3 years and its never let me down.The LED is great.The postive stops is great.I dont know what all the hub bub is about not being able to see the cut.Unless its a worm drive theres going to be the gaurd blocking some of the view.And if the gaurd dosent slide up then you didnt set the proper depth for your cut.The only reason i address those issues that people mention is.Because there simple rules that any skilled framer/carpenter should know.As for the two ratings that the saw didnt cut square and such.Thats because chances are the model you bought was defective.I bought my saw direct and its never given me any trouble.Its a great saw.
5,Spectacular,"I bought this to replace a saw that was handed down to me that was originally bought new by my Grandfather. Wow, saws have come a long way. Light weight, so unbelievable. Not flimsy, but so light and easy to handle. Plus a million more safety features than I could have imagined. Amazing that they could engineer this saw to cut the workpiece so well but nothing else (fingers, the table I set it on afterwards, etc).I could not be more satisfied with this tool. I used it to build a hefty workbench and various other storage and shelving in order to get my new workshop up and running. It has preformed like a champ.So easy to use, so safe, ANYONE could use this from a novice getting their first saw to a hardened pro carpenter.There is a reason that the Makita circular saw has that reputation like the Dewalt drill, the Bosch Jigsaw, Craftsman tool boxes, etc as the most desirable of that type of tool."
4,Good but not great,This book is a very good resource but due to the recent shifts in exercise physiology it isn't quite cutting edge anymore but is still a worthwhile resource.
2,Sad & Un-happy,"I was not happy with this. The unit was OK but I was not happy that the DVD player did not have the decoder included. So I couldn't play movies. The USB ports are not highspeed so the wireless network is slow and lacking. Whats next... By the time you add to this what you would need to make it sweet you can just buy a new one, software all included with full support and warranty. Either the price has too come down for this USED item or the software has to be fluffed up. There really is little incentive to buy this item. I learned the hard way. Be for-warned shopper."
2,tony hawk is a sellout!,"I can' t believe everyone likes Tony Hawk. He is such a sellout. What kind of skateboarder has a book about himself. Have you seen the commercials he has been in. I mean tarzan, come on! Also a game about himself all because he landed a stupid trick once or twice( a 900).Sure I could see a book about a person who invented electricity, or discovered something that changed the world. I just don`t like TONY HAWK!"
5,The Man,"Tony's fantastic biogriphy of half-bird half-man tells of when Tony actually seemed...well human. Yes, it goes back to when he was just a kid with a board hangin' at his side. Ever wonder how Hawk evolved? It's hard to belive that HE was once the youth of the nation who worshiped skaters himself, just like many worship him. Packed with fun, stories, triumphs and biffs, you finally go behind the mind's eye to the history of ""The Man-Bird."""
5,Tony Hawk - a true inspiration,"Tony Hawk was already a hero to many, years before he landed what seemed to be an impossible trick - the 9. While growing up during the 80's, Tony Hawk's pictures were plastered all over my walls alongside pictures of other skateboarding greats, including Mike Vallely, Steve Caballero, Mark Gonzales and Rodney Mullen. I knew in 1986 that Tony Hawk was perhaps the greatest skateboarder known to man. This book reveals a side of Tony that I and many others never knew. A boy who was harder on himself than anyone else could be. A person who never let the ""rock-star mentality"" ruin his career and a person who believed in the future of skateboarding enough to venture out on his own, not knowing what would happen. This book is extremely funny and warm. It shows Tony as just another human being, even though no matter what happens, he'll always remain a hero to some of us."
2,"Amazing singing, but flawed production of the CD.","While the singing on this CD is fantastic, only one track had the correct track labeling. I don't know if this one CD I purchased was a fluke (and Amazon.com needs to replace it) or it is a general production flaw. Amazing singing, but flawed production of the CD."
5,I love it,"Great to listen to good voice, good diction, well orchestrated recording of music for this time of year. All songs selected most appropriate."
3,"Good, but annoying.","I also thought that the instructor was very annoying, and also very unnecessary. I did enjoy the workouts though, and I thought it was nice that there were 3 different people showing how to do the work out."
2,Not For Beginners!! Beginner Example is very rarely shown!!,"The instructor is annoying, but the worst part is the camera work. The instructor clearly states which team member is the beginner example but they are very rarely seen. When you do see the beginner person, you do see they are doing something different than the advanced examples who get shown much, much more. I know very little about pilates, wanted to learn more, but am extremely disappointed in this ""beginner"" video. I don't feel safe using this video as a learning tool at all. The back of the box does say the video has a Glossary with visual footage, but those are just still photos with a background speaker, not a video demonstration."
4,Her voice is not a problem for me,I like this DVD. I take pilates classes. When I am unable to go I use this DVD. Since one is not always watching the tv every minute her voice inflections can be helpful.
2,Fingernails on the Chalkboard,"The ""head instructor"" (Carrie Clark) in this video has the most annoying delivery I've ever heard on a fitness DVD/CD... Her inflection is reminiscent of a melodramatic High School production of some Shakespearean play. It must be heard to be believed; but then, you'd have to purchase it. There is a reason there are so many used copies for sale so cheaply here. There is one other segment led by a different instructor who is much better, but it's short (the Back Workout).The exercises themselves are standard Pilates fare."
2,Annoying!,"First of all, I must agree with the above review that Carrie Clark's delivery is about as pleasant as root canal. (I honestly kept expecting her to put me on a time-out if I didn't do the exercise correctly,lol!)I am a Pilates instructor, and while I respect the classical format, our lifestyles have changed dramatically in the 40 years since Joseph Pilates passed away. Many people have needs and postural issues that could be made worse by using only the classical format, yet could benefit greatly from modifications and by changing it up."
1,DCC for the complete novice,"If you know absolutely nothing about DCC, this is an expensive way to start - you will be better served by buying a different book. Kalbach Publishing have failed miserably with this one - it never hits its mark and is useless as an independant guide - contains almost no information. Cannot recommend."
4,DCC made easy,This book is perfect for anyone just getting into the World of DCC. Mr. Strang makes it very easy to understand DCC. I read it before i started helping to wire the layout of the club i belong to along with a club member who has been in DCC for quite sometime. If you want alot of indepth information this book is not for you but it will help you get started. You want more indepth information on DCC go with one of the other DCC guides but you should start out with this guide first.
4,Precious guide for dcc beginners,"A good book, very helpful for begin in DCC sistem control for model railroaders."
2,Save your money,Waste of paper. This is not a book. It is a large pamphlet. Very little if any useful info in here. Look elsewhere if you are seriously interested in DCC operations.
3,Tony's Great / Great Music / Applause way too distracting!!,"This recording has many redeeming qualities. The music, the artist and even the recording quality get very high marks except for one thing. The frequent applause is 20-30 decibels too loud and interrupts what would be one of my favorite recordings far to often. The hot crispy frying egg applause every two minutes really gets me reaching for the volume control. The cd is worth having, but it could have been great! It is a shame the recording engineers don't pay more attention to such things.."
3,But For The Crowd Noise,I love Tony Bennett and rushed out to buy this CD when it was issued. The music is fantastic except that the applause is too much and too often. If only they had reduced all that noise it'll be one of Tony's very best. I had to sell mine just for the noise.Joel K.
5,A Fun Read,"I loved this book! It was like eating peanuts, I couldn't stop once I started! It was full of fascinating and intelligent discussions on the nature and limits of scientific and mathematical knowledge that were just plain fun to read about! Also interesting was the character and place development that provided the context for the meetings and discussions of the remarkable men we meet in the book."
2,As dry and tasteless as year old soda crackers,"This book reminds me of a Brit after WWII telling how they won the war...There seems to be a delusion here about American/ Princeton preminencein science and mathematics. Casti is very much a spokesman for the past,not the future. There is really no real science fiction here: it is embarrassing to sci fi to have this called by that name. A lot of the ideas he talks about are out of place at this time ( they were late 50's early 60's ideas). His tone is that of a lecturer who doesn't care if he puts the audience to asleep. I've read several of his other books and none was as arrogant or elitist as this one. He just has failed to read about the lives of the main characters or to understand them? They are not the people I have read about in a number of biographies.I think the worst thing this book does is suck the life out of the ideas that it tries to discuss?He just gets it wrong in so many ways."
3,pretty cool,"This book was pretty cool. Here's what happens: First, the baby-sitters have a fight. It's bad enough when Mary anne is left alone at the lunch table, but when Jenny Perezzoi gets sick while Mary anne's baby-sitting her, Mary anne thinks it's time to take charge."
4,"Yay! MaryAnne, still in braids!","Long before Brittany Spears, there was MaryAnne. Still in her plaid jumpers and braids of the early years, when I believe the girls are all still in 7th grade, MaryAnne hasn't had much excitement in her life yet. She hasn't even met Logan. But she does proove early on that she is compassionate and competent and, above all, a darn good babysitter. I was actually in an emergency babysitting situation one time, and cheesy though it may sound I thought of MaryAnne. Hell, if MaryAnne could call an ambulance, than so could I, and darned if that's not exactly what i did. It's my feeling that the earlier books tended to be better written then the latest ones (perhaps before Ann got a ghostwriter?), and you can see this in MaryAnne Saves the Day. The characters are still real, still capable of change and complexity, not yet the cardboard cutouts perpetual 8th graders they are to become."
2,Too predictable,I found this book very predictable. It was quite obvious that the BBC were going to get back together in the end. I also disliked how Ann Martin always spends at least two chapters in some of her books explaining the history of the BBC. I have read several of her other books and I have found them all very alike. Overall this book is easy to read and easy to forget. It is a pity that the early books contain very few male characters. I also find that Mary Anne is a very irritating character. She is very immature for most of this book and she spends most of her time complaining about her father.
1,Mad with a capital M!,"I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said ""So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it."" I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!"
4,Comfortable and attractive,"I like everything about this chair except its somewhat limited range of height adjustment (probably not a concern for most, but I use with a desk that's unusually high)."
5,Joyful Xmas,I've been looking for the DC Talk song on this CD for a long time. I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon and for a great price!
3,Color not as pictured,"I was excited to order the lip stain and spent more than I normally would for it. Unfortunately, the shade of the product and the color pictured are quite a bit different. It ended up being more pink-ish than it appears in the photo. Obviously the two are not going to match up perfectly but it was a little too off for me. I guess this is a product to buy in person and not online so you can see exactly what you're buying."
1,A very BIG Disappointment,I was looking forward to receiving this and ended up very disappointed. The stain went on watery and did not cover well at all - it took numerous coats to get it even looking. Then it took a long while to dry and it came off almost immediately. This product is WAY too expensive to perform SO poorly.
2,Disappointed,When I draw the applicator out of the tube there is very little product on it. Only a little dry color goes on my face. I have to dip it in and out several times to get enough color to spread. I don't know if this is the way it is supposed to work or if I got an old drying tube of product..
5,Great Product,"This stuff is great! The color is perfect, and a little goes a long way. The trick is to get good at applying it, since it is a stain and it dries quickly. The tube lasts a really long time, and the stain lasts on your lips for about an hour or so. When used lightly, it looks very natural. Recommended!"
3,Very dark,"Functionally, this gel stain works well. It is more watery than I had expected, but is pretty easy to use. However, the color is much darker than what is shown in the picture. I have a medium complection and this color looked like a purple bruise on my cheeks. Not flattering."
1,Dissapointed,"I got this product in ""Liquid Kiss"" and it was a dark red/brown on me. It would not stain my lips properly and I had to put a ton of it on just to get the color to look even on them, which resulted in that dark red/brown color. I'm not picky about shades normally, but this one just looked gross on me. I am white with dark hair and goldenish skin. I would consider trying another shade if I could find this product locally and try it on my skin before spending $20+ on it. Yet, I suspect I'd have to put so much on, it'd be gone quick and I'm way too thrifty to buy a stain every 3 seconds. Overall, just not for me."
5,Lip gel Stain by Vincent Longo,"This lip stain is superb! It is true to color on your lips and will not change color. Make sure your lips are clean of any product before applying to ensure that the color remains on your lips for the longest amount of time. I find that the product is natural looking and does not feel like you are wearing anything at all on your lips. I like to use a transparent gloss with a lip plumper added for a youthful-looking plump and luscious pout AFTER applying the stain gel. The added gloss also helps moisturize the lips yet does not feel heavy. I am very fair with very neutral skin color and like the ""Liquid Kiss"" color. It can be warmed up by using a orange tinted gloss or cooled down to a mauve by using a purple tinted gloss. Be aware that even a slight bit of tinted gloss deepens the color so apply sparingly until you are aware of how deep you want to go with this shade. I love all these stains by Vincent Longo!!!!"
2,Not what I expected.,"I was hoping for something akin to the VL lip stain. This is NOT it. It's a creamier type base, doesn't stain. Doesn't stay either. Another item to go to the bottom of the drawer..."
3,Short on information and photographs,"I'm a Yank who is a huge fan of Britcoms. I've used the original edition of this book as a reference source since about 1999 IIRC. While this revised edition contains information on shows that have aired since the original edition, the information is scant and for some reason, there are very few photos -- even many of the photos from the original edition are gone -- the majority of the entries for a given show have no photos at all. As a Britcom fan, I hoped for more inside and detailed information, particularly cast listings (which are very brief and in many cases very incomplete). Also, rather than sample episode plot summaries withing the text of the descriptions of the shows, I'd like to have full episode guides."
2,Britcoms for Beginners,"I love britcoms, and British television in general, as much as anyone, but this book is lacking in one key are: no episode guide to any of the series! As far as I'm concerned, this should be the most important part of a book like this, and its omission is a big flaw. Without episode guides, it's simply a overview of Britcoms for beginners. It would only require one sentence for each episode and since some of the series are only 12 or 20 episodes it wouldn't have taken up much space. Still, if you just want a simple overview of Britcoms and a bit of trivia, it's ok."
1,Best of the Britcoms,"As an avid Britcom fan, I found this book terribly disappointing. All it does is go over the storylines--if you know the shows, you already know the storylines. I expected some interesting personal information about the stars. Also, the photos are just stills from the shows, or basic cast shots--many of terrible printing quality. Additionally, a lot of out-of-date information is included in the text. I do not recommend anyone buy this book."
5,best of britcoms,i love british comedy..this book is well described and has been loaned many times..a keeper.
3,But is it ROOT Bark??,"This ad indicates root bark, and the item on the invoice as received says root bark. The invoice item number matches the label, and the company says there is only the one sassafras product. But since the actual label on the mylar bag says ""sassafras bark"", what do I have? Root bark or bark? I am assuming there's a difference, and we'll find out when I prep my root beer extract. A needless worry maybe, but since sassafras root is hard to find due to the probably bogus safrole rigamarole, this makes me suspicious. Hence, for the confusion, three stars only for the prompt delivery and a 800 customer number that answered the phone after 5 pm (even if the agent couldn't answer my question)."
3,The belt is brown and black on one side and is not reversible.,"This is a nice belt of good quality leather and I am keeping it because I wanted a nice leather belt.It is not what I would call a ""two-tone"" belt. To me, a two-tone belt is one that is brown on one side and black on the other, and from the picture, that is what this belt looks like. It is a black belt with brown leather detailing and you can only wear it one way."
2,"Invaluable book, question the price","I agree with the other reviewers that this is an absolutely essential item on the bookshelf of any geologist and earth scientist.However, I question the price, which appears to reflect a significant markup by resellers. Glossary of Geology can be purchased new in hardcover directly from the publisher, the American Geoscience (formerly Geologic) Institute, on their website (agiweb.org). They charge $79.95 or $69.95 for members of AGI's member societies. Students or young professionals who would blanch at paying $199 for a reference book (actually, old professionals too) would like to know they can buy direct."
5,Are you teasing us?,"Finally, we get the female Cenobite in the last of NECA's Hellraiser series.Another nice job, this is the female Cenobite of the first Hellraiser (as Hellbound featured a different actress) and is very faithful, piercings and all. Friendly as ever, she comes with a set of grisly tools, two of which she can wield. Stands on her own very well. Another top figure.You can complete the original Hellraiser 'lineup' now while worrying others. Long overdue, this series did pretty well. Highly recommended for fans of the demented."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered a bar of this soap, thinking it was a simple glycerin-only soap. Turns out, it has a strong, perfumed, smell. That doesn't work for me. They don't honestly label the ingredients, instead saying ""all natural"" and ""contains Glycerin and Vitamin E.""I doubt I'll even use it. If I put something that perfumed on my body, I typically end up with hives."
2,Does not work as great as it looks...,Pros:Works in left or right hand.Great to use when you don't have a surface for a mouse or trackball.Cons:Trackball is too loose (rattles) making it feel like its broken or defective.Not as responsive as other trackballs.Feels like it is worth less than it looks.Conclusion: Missed the Mark!I thought this would be a great alternative to laptop trackpad. I am returning this because I prefer to use my trackpad on my laptop to this.
2,Still Looking...,What I really liked about the hand held trackball is freedom to sit or stand anywhere(without a table top) to control my computer. I have been checking for other products like it and have only found this trackball. What I hate about this product is it becomes useless after a year or two. This is my fourth Fellowes trackball in about five years. If it wasn't for the short lifespan I would be happy with the product.Maybe in a few years they may come out with a wireless model. Then I could get rid of the long extension cable that runs across my floor to the couch. If it wasn't for the price I probably wouldn't have bought more than a couple over the years. This is the only pointing device that I have found that I can sit on my couch and play computer games for hours without muscle fatigue in my arm or wrist.
2,"Not good for linux, not much better for xp","I bought this a little over a month ago, along with the finger-mouse, and discovered that this particular mouse isn't all that functional. I tried working on configuring it, but nothing got it to work all the way. The trackball kept popping out of place so that it couldn't be sensed when it moved, the left mouse button didn't work, and neither did the loop-finger button. Overall, I'd vote this as a waste of 20 bucks."
4,that's excellent,"Its very usefull, This article is excellent. It works very well and it is not necessary to lean it on anything, explore with the thumb."
1,NEW ONES ARE JUNK,"BEWARE - THE NEW ONES ARE JUNK. The ones with black cords have a main button that has a hair trigger and doesn't click. I'm having to take them apart and unsolder the microswitches and move them around. Have wasted $100 buying many of these all from different vendors, can't find a good one. One was DOA, the ones with silver cords click but are way too slow.CONSIDER THIS A NO STARS REVIEW."
3,Trigger button stopped working in 6 months...,"I absolutely loved this mouse until today when the very important, left-click trigger button gave out. I used it every single day, but wasn't rough with it. I came here today to buy another, but now I'm seeing the same exact button problem in other reviews. I really need (want) another one, but they really need to improve them first."
3,Finger Mouse,"This is a good mouse for presentations and general surfing, but it is not as precise as I had hoped, and since I wanted to use it to ease my carpal tunnel while gaming it has proven to not be up to the task. If you just want a mouse to use for your laptop, and pin-point accuracy is not a concern this will work quite well for you."
4,A usefull little tool...,I recently purchased one for photography. It enables me to control the camera when I am shooting tethered to my lap top without being on top of the camera or sitting at a desk. About my only gripes are that the finger trigger is a little hard to get used to. I invariable end up using mine in the palm of my hand with my thumb controling the roller and right button. And though I normally have problem with trackballs grabbing the scroll bars can be a bit tricky. Though for the mission I have assigned this device it is perfect.Point of interest though it doesn't mention it in the description. It works equally well on both my PC Laptop and my MacBook.
4,handheld trac ball mouse for laptop,"This is one of the most convenient products on the market. A mouse that doesnt have to have a level surface to be used.I bought it for my husband to use on his laptop. he drives an 18wheeler and has limited room for such things. when I bought my laptop, I bought myself the same mouse. I think that they are great. You can actually sit comfortably on any type of chair and work with your computer or laptop. No wrist problems either.they are just a little harder to clean than a regular mouse."
1,"Great concept, poor materials!","I love using the Fellowes Micro-Trac, but I have gone thtough 8 this year! The trigger switch fails after about one month of heavy use. My last one failed after just one week. Fellowes replaced 2 for me, both replacements also failed. I will be overjoyed when they fix this defect!"
1,trackball doesn't work well at all,"This will be my 3rd trackball in three years. The design idea is nice, but not as functional as a desktop mouse. The rollerball jumps around, and is hard to select items. 3 years ago, I paid half the price as I paid recently, and I am very dissappointed. I will not buy this product again. They do not last, and they do not work well"
4,Great concept - not for Windows Vista,The specs don't say it's compatible with Vista but I wanted to try it anyway. It definately is not for Vista. I'm sending it back and trying something else. Lesson learned. It's still a great product though. I tried it on my work PC and it's really neat to use once you get used to the feel of it.
2,Fellowes Micro Track Ball,"This is a great product for my Laptop and I use one all the time. The reason I rated it a 2 is because the average lifespan on one is about a month...some will last 2 or 3 and 1 quit in one day. I have a box of about 20 that either the ball quit or the clicker broke. I may package them someday and send back to Fellows. However, when they work, they are really good to do graphics and easy to get details with the pointer. My recommendation is that if you can afford these, they are great, or if you have the patience to send back to Fellowes, they will replace free. Overall: Shop around for good value, expect detailed use for short time, save package and if we all send them back...maybe they could be made to last a little more than a month."
5,finger mouse,"I was very happy with this product, they are the only thing I like to use with my laptop. They all seem to last about a year but for the price I am happy with that."
1,Does not last.!,"I bought one of these about 6 months ago and the trigger button no longer clicks and if you barely touch it while you are moving the courser it highlights everything. One of the top buttons is starting to get catchy also. I have not tried any of the other manufacturers yet, but I don't think that I will buy another one of these."
3,Easy to use,"I really like the ease of having the mouse in my hand. I'm not so thrilled with the construction of the product. Sometimes the ball falls out. I would probably purchase it, or most likely one like it but made by a different company, again."
1,Extreme price for a cheap product,"I bought this mouse several years ago for about $15, but now it's $88?!? I certainly hope it has improved tremendously as mine had to be tossed because the ball wasn't even precise enough to point the cursor exactly where you needed it."
2,Ok,"I purchased this mouse because my wrist sometimes bothers me. It's a great concept. Unfortunately, poor build quality and unprogrammable buttons earned this device a spot in my junk drawer."
2,Great design but needs to be sturdier,"I loved this mouse. In fact, I loved 4 of them. Each one wore out after about 2 months. I bought new ones, returned them, exchanged them, wrote to Fellowes, complained and finally stopped buying them. The buttons quit working after about a month and then would only work intermittently until I gave up on them. If you don't intend to use it much, it would probably be a great thing to have. But if you want reliability, get something else.I love this design, I just wish it wasn't made so cheaply. And I won't buy another one."
4,Nice For Browsing,"Works great if you simply use it for browsing, and don't have to type much..I only wish it could be set down to use like a desk top mouse..I love the track ball."
1,Light but a poor design,"I purchased this to use with a new laptop in the hopes of obtaining a useful replacement for the touch pad. I have not found it possible to make it work without a finger inserted in the hole. This makes it very inconvenient to do operations that involve both typing and cursor placement. In theory, it should sit on the desk and be useable in the same manner as a larger trackball. It's light weight makes this impossible. Not recommended."
3,Micro track-metallic silver,"It was a gift so I don't use it. I think the person is satisfied, I haven't heard any complaints. I will say the shipping was fast."
5,Roy,"What else can be said, there was only one Roy Orbison, this album proves it. Blue Angel, was one of his best."
3,A Little Roy Goes a Long Way,"I suspect that no matter what my opinion is, this disc, one of the final two (and first two SACD) releases from the late MFSL will become a cult collector's item. Oh, well... In any event, my opinion as expressed above has not changed--a little of Orbison's voice went a long, long way; he sounded better in a group setting than on his own. When you get down to it, the music on this CD is pretty hokey stuff, and it is really hard to see what all the fuss is about."
1,No está escrito em Portugus mas em Portugus do Brasil,"Bastou ler o primeiro parágrafo para perceber que este livro no está escrito em Portugus mas sim em Portugus do Brasil :( No haveria nenhum mal nisso se o título fosse claro. Ao dizer ""Portuguese Edition"" no se espera que a obra venha escrita em Portugus do Brasil."
5,I LOVE this stuff!,"I bought a travel sized container of this for a business trip, when I didn't have much space to pack tons of beauty aids. I got the shampoo and conditioner too, the 3 pack was the best $15 spend at a salon, ever. I am now completely in love with it. Don't use much, a little goes a long way. I have hair a little past my shoulders, and use about a half pump to get my curls to look awesome all day long. This is by far the easiest way that I have found to make my hair look awesome. 5 minutes of prep with this rather than 30 minutes of prep with 3 or 4 other products in conjunction with each other."
5,Laurel & Hardy - Air Raid Wardens 1943 / 1944 Nothing but Trouble,"A duble treat from Comedy .. Immortals Laurel and Hardy ! Whether serving their country in wartime or serving multicourse maeltime mayhem , Laurel ( Stan Laurel 1890-1965) and Hardy ( Oliver Hardy 1892-1957) serve up laughs in this classic twofer . First , the nation calls out in its hour of need . Stan and Oliver answer .. amd Uncle Sam changes his mind . Rejected by the military , our heroes bacome AIR RAID WARDENS. Lights-out laughts include a donnybrook with slowburn comic Edgar Kennedy (1890-1948) and run-in with a nest of spies . in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE the boys fuss with finagle as World War II-era domestic who rally'round and exited boy king when danger arises . Sam Taylor (1895-1958), co-director of Harold Llyoyd's (1893-1971 famed hanging-the-clock-high-above-city-traffic movie (Safety Last , 1923) ! Guides this romp that includes a gem of ledge-hanging sequence . Hold tight for all-down funny fun . High Quality Transfer ."
1,Quaint Comedy Could Have Been Better,"Most L & H fans know that the boys made a long series of MGM/FOX pictures which reflected the big studio ""assembly line"" film-making approach and the wartime atmosphere. Students of film comedy understand how the ""traditional"" Stan & Ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard. However, it's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go COMPLETELY to waste, as it does in AAW - the presence of Edgar Kennedy should lift th proceedings; instead it reinforces the melancholia. I found the drunken scene most distasteful. Still, L & H followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been."
3,Air Raid Riots,"Laurel & Hardy down on their luck and bumbling failures throughout this entire film until they finally are able to prove themselves worthy by thwarting a plot to destroy their towns most valuable war asset. Although the movie does not feature the popular background music we are used to in the previous Laurel & Hardy features and has a way too large Hardy they still have great timing and provide laughs. Not nearly as bad as the horrific to watch ""Atoll K(Utopia)"" in which their timing was horrible and they both looked incredibly unhealthy. This one was a pleasant watch. I think the kids would enjoy this."
3,Air Raid Specialties,Laurel & Hardy towards the end of their moviemaking days. This is a so-so effort. Not as funny as previous efforts and lacking the background music that fans were so accustomed to in earlier movies. Oliver Hardy looks rather unhealthy...in the past he was quite heavy but at this point you could say he was a little too heavy. Although the comedy team seemed to have good timing in this one as opposed to their final comedy Atoll K(Utopia) in which was just a horror to watch. This is basically an entire movie about Stan & Ollie's failures until they stumble upon a secret Nazi headquarters and help thwart an effort to destroy the towns most valuable war asset. It isn't great but it's not terrible either...the kids probably would get some laughs out of it.
2,Watch this wartime L & H comedy with a group of friends.,"Some comedies come to life with an audience. ""Air Raid Wardens"" is a real ""audience"" picture, with Stan and Ollie bumbling their way through air-raid duty, first-aid practice, and spy-catching. As usual with Laurel & Hardy, you can see the jokes coming. Audiences loved this underrated film in '43. It's got some good scenes, but you'll either admire or hate the ""sad"" episodes where the boys have to play it straight."
2,Stan and Ollie in the Clutches of Leo the Lion,"The best aspect of this Laurel and Hardy ""double feature"" is the excellent print quality. In fact, the Warner DVD transfers are far superior to Hallmark's pathetic L&H product. Unfortunately, ""Air Raid Wardens"" (1943) and ""Nothing But Trouble"" (1944) find Stan and Ollie submerged in the cold rigidness of MGM's studio system - the same fate that greeted Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and Our Gang. The boys deliver a few laughs in these later efforts, but the fun and spontaneity of the Hal Roach days are long gone."
5,Great B&W flicks with very good DVD quality.,"Both movies on DVD are fine showings of Laurel's and Hardy's talents. As always there is plenty of laughs and stants. Even my 7-year old daughter was laughing to tears. The quality of DVD - audio and video - is excellent, and maybe there are not too many extras, the movie itself is very satissfying. Highly recommended for Olie and Stan buffs and new-comers."
4,Glimpse into the Past,"Zane Grey's BOULDER DAM is an excellent read with vivid descriptions of the construction process. The book was of a deep interest to me because I live near another large dam that has been under repair for the last seven years.The story of Lynn Weston's drive to make a success of himself by tackling all the difficult jobs entailed in the construction is from another era when people assumed responsibility for their own actions.The fight scenes have a quality of human interaction that is seldom present in many current adventure stories. An good read and a fine example of why 'western romance' still attracts readers.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
5,A Dam good book! ;-),Zane Grey is at his best in this story of the building of the Boulder Dam ( Later renamed the Hoover Dam). It shows an excellent depiction of early day Las Vegas and the people who built the dam. Of course there is the damsel in distress and the hero who gives up all to start his life anew.Like I said typical Zane Grey. But a must read if you have ever made the trip or are thinking of treking to the Dam.
2,Dry and dull,"For the scholar only. Considering the high price of this book, way too many of the prints are in black and white. ""From Flanders to Florence"" is a much better book, with much better pics."
5,"Interesting, enlightening, and entertaining.","This was an excellent tale of how a young adolescent risked the brutality of the Imperial Navy rather than return home in discrace after being expelled. His rise to Naval Air Pilot was no easy feat in the peacetime Navy. He had brought a human face to those faceless enemy pilots, for all of us who were brought up on John Wayne movies. His justifications of the drastic measures taken by the airmen towards the end of the war made a little more sense when he had presented them in this manner.I highly recommend this book for anyone curios about what it was like on the ""other side""."
5,A REAL ACCOUNT OF A WWII JAPANESE PILOT,I just finished the 1957 copy borrowed from our public library--great read! A very insightful book showing Saburo Sakai's transition from poor boy to unsuccessful student to Japan Flying Ace. It opens your eyes to not only the inside story of the WWII Japanese pilot but the Japanese man's head and heart. He brings to light war statistics from the Japanese side that challenge American history and counters the belief that all Japanese were willing Kamikazes. He describes Japanese culture and the deterioration of Japanese life and even includes his personal struggle to feel fit to marry as Japanese pilots almost assuredly would die. It really brings to light how many more similarities than differences people at war experience and also how our cultures shape us. Highly recommended.
2,"Nostalgia, 1937","Fun to read. This is a how to for making toys from peanut shells, corks, cardboard, boxes - an insight into childhood and parenthood in 1937. One parachute is made from an ""orange wrapper"", Noah's Ark from a paper bag, dolls from socks. The paper toys are wonderful and would make fabulous holiday decorations."
5,My daughter loves little bear,"The little bear series is good for an emerging reader, neither too long nor too easy. I only wish there were more stories in the series."
5,Quotation Marks,I bought this book to used as a teaching lesson. This book has through out the story lots of quotation marks and the story is relateable to a 5 year old.
5,Mystriuos Masquerade!,This book was amazing! It was my favorite stroy when I was little and still is. All the beautiful and rich pictures helps bring the story to life. It's full of riddles that never end. The Masquerade was well written and keeps the reader coming back to solve the mystory of were the hare lost the moons gift to the sun.
4,Good phones small buttons...,"I like the phone but have 2 minor complaints. The buttons are quite small and are a little difficult to punch accurately. Second, the buttons are not backlit, so they cannot be seen in the dark. I need to make calls in the middle of the night, so this is an annoyance for me. The reception and battery life are good."
3,"Good phone, but interferes with wireless network","I have had this phone for three years and the batteries are starting to go, which is really good for three years, but I am not getting it again because it's interfering with our wireless computer network. If that's not an issue, it's been a really good, really reliable phone!"
3,"OK, so far","Its good so far. I have gifted it to someone in India. Its working fine, the main motivation of buying this model was the intercom feature -- and that is working fine.However, there is problem about with Caller ID, it is not working."
4,Challenging keys,"This phone set works perfectly and is a good value, but the compact handsets have small buttons. Their size and the hard-to-read, yellowish labels make it challening to find the desired buttons."
2,BRIEF GETS BAGGY : BUY RIGHT SIZE I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,"I PURCHASED A SIZE 11 AND RETURNED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SMALL FOR A SIZE 11...THEN I PURCHASED A SIZE 12 AND THEY FIT UNTIL I WORE THEM AND THEN THEY STRETCHED OUT AS I WORE THEM THAT DAY AND BECAME LONG AND BAGGY....THE CROTCH AREA GETS LONG AND HANGS BETWEEN YOUR LEGS AND GETS THIN, LIKE YOU HAVE NOTHING ON. SO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU BUY YOUR CORRECT SIZE AND NOT GO LARGER...THEY WILL FEEL SMALL AT FIRST BUT LIKE I SAID THEY REALLY GET LOOSE AND DON'T FIT WELL...."
2,Panties,I thought I had ordered Vanity Fair Panties but that is not what I received. They were much too large so I donated them to a Charity Thrift Store.
5,Excellent,"While I ordered a size too big (they are very generously sized - and no, they don't shrink), the quality is great. I cannot tolerate elastic cutting into my leg and they were the answer!"
4,Seeing Abuse From Another Point,"Leaping Upon the Mountians, gave me many ways to look at how men who were abused as children see things. Being in a relationship with a survivor, is hard. Trying to see see things from their perspective is not always easy. This book helps me see how to look at it."
5,The next step,"Leaping Upon The Mountains takes survivors to the next step in recovery, picking up where Victims No Longer left off. One of the best way survivors can learn is by hearing the stories of others, and their strategies for recovery. Leaping Upon The Mountains offers an incredible wealth of information and lessons for survivors to take into their daily lives."
4,Great work shorts!!,"I got these for my boyfriend for his birthday and he just loves them. They are more lightweight than your average carhartts and a little longer. These are great for working outside in the summer, especially in Albuquerque were it is so hot and dry.My only complaint is that when I ordered the shorts the image of the color I picked (Dark Khaki) out was allot darker than the actual shorts I received. It's not that big a deal because my boyfriend says he likes the color they are. If I were buying them for myself I would have been a little more irritated."
4,nice shorts,"Love these shorts....wear them every day. Wife complains that I should wash them more often. I use these as work shorts mainly, but wear them everywhere.They only get 4 stars because they are not 100% made in the USA, like I thought they were. They are assembled in Mexico from 100% US supplied products.Can Amazon eventually sort, or describe, products according to their USA supplied content and origins? I would pay more for items I knew were made here."
5,"great lyrics, pretty good pickin'","This is another one of those guys you wonder why they aren't on every radio station all the time instead of some of the other gutless folk music out there. ""Leveland"" is both poignant and tells the whole sick story of modern agriculture in FOUR minutes!"
5,This One's On My Eternal Playlist,"I have all James McMurtry's albums, have seen him several times over various releases, and this is still the acme for me. This album continues to resonate after all these years. When my Ipod hits a song from this album in its shuffle I invariably turn the volume up. This is a beautiful album, but one that does not take a cheery view of life. These are not songs that will make you smile or brighten your day. McMurtry's world is populated with the desperate, the failed, and those just hanging on. The songs ""Down Across the Delaware"", ""Levelland"", ""One More Winter"", and ""Where'd You Hide the Body"" are so lovely and so bleak. And if you are ever driving across west Texas, this is part of the soundtrack you need to play (see also Terry Allen and Jimmie Dale Gilmore). Give a listen to a great singer-songwriter and his best album (so far)."
5,You gotta hear this!,"This album starts out with six of the finest examples of songwriting that you are bound to encounter, anywhere. The next seven (including the instumental) fall just a notch below the openers in terms of quality.With a knack for illuminating the tiniest details, James McMurtry has the ability to boil a short story down into a song. The songs themselves, detail lives in small towns and on the margins of society with empathy, but without romanticizing them into cliches. They are just like mini-documentaries delivered in the authors weary, been there-seen that voice.Don Dixon's production is inventive and does an outstanding job of throwing these tales into high relief. If you admire anyone who can be considered a songwriter's songwriter, and are unfamiliar with James McMurtry's work, Start here."
5,Keep your hands where I can see 'em so I won't have to shoot,"James McMurtry inherited the storytelling gene from his father, novelist Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove"", ""Dead Man's Walk"", ""Terms of Endearment"", etc.). This album features some of his most interesting and catchy work, as he sings about love, heartbreak, childhood, and drunkenness. Highly recommended."
2,Disagee with other reviewers,"Both my wife and I found this book to be very inferior to other guide books on Australia (eg Rough Guide is far superior in our opinon). The Moon Handbook gives just basic information on tourist sites which is okay, but it doesn't go into anything out of the ordinary. I bought the book because of the positive reviews and the recent edition (late 2005) - both of which were the wrong reasons to buy. The book is not worth lugging around Australia."
2,Not a keeper,"Usually I 'wish list' movies that may not be keepers, and only buy those that sound like good candidates for my permanent collection, based on editorial descriptions and reviews. This one went on the block as soon as I watched it."
2,Sun kissed?,"There is something missed in this story of a student writing his first novel in an isolated house of his professor who had additionally supplied him with younger, twenty-year-old-already-widowed carer experimenting with his sexuality in this professor's beach-house king-size bed.A very ordinary work indeed also actors performed well."
1,Amateur night,"The only word to describe ""Sun Kissed"" is amateurish. The acting is bad. The dialogue is bad. The songs (or maybe it's the same song) that pop up about every five minutes, are bad. Worst aspect of all is the grainy photography, which makes it almost painful to watch the thing.Maybe things got better as the movie progressed, but I could only stand about thirty minutes. After the second (or was it the third) time our hero started dancing in drag I gave up.Great things can be made on a small budget. Unfortunately, ""Sun Kissed"" is not one of them."
5,"Excellent, Readable, Complete","This is one very readable book that synthasizes the 24 Thomistic Thesis. Fr.G-G puts together the arguments for the xistence of God and shows their unity and implications. He does the same for the knowledge and nature of God, Angels, Humans, and Morality. This is a theological text but has a lot of excellent philosophical insight which is Aristotelean and Thomistic. Fr. G-G shows how THomas builds on Aristotle. I regret that the author did not consider the modernist (Hume, Kant) objections to the Thomistic proofs, but this is a marvelous focus on the mideaval mind."
2,Kindle edition problems,"I haven't yet been able to read the book, but the Kindle edition has a serious flaw. The type is very small. I had to increase the size substantially in order to read it, and after doing that all my other books are too large. It is just a small nuisance but I would appreciate it if future digital editions were of standard size print so that I can simply set my Kindle to the size I want."
2,Not HAPPENING,I LOVE ARETHA but this Disc is Flat.Much Like Marvin Gaye Trying to Do Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole before His Voice Kicked In the same Goes For Aretha Here.It's To Early In Her Vocal&Musical Development Period To Try To Even Sing A Dinah Washington Song Let Alone do a Album.but I considering how So-So Her Albums Have been overe the past 20 Years this Might Be a Project Worth Doing Now?
5,An Overlooked Gem,"I stumbled upon this album in a used record store years before it was issued on compact disc. I have always been a huge Aretha fan but was not impressed by her Columbia work as a whole. This album was a huge surprise. In my opinion, it stands with her classic work at Atlantic Records. One can feel in her voice the raw emotion with which she sings these songs. Her sense of loss in the death of Dinah Washington is palpable. I have been a music collector for over forty years. If I were to compile a list of the ten best ""forgotten"" albums, this would be at or near the top of the list.The sound on the compact disc is superb. I was delighted to see that Columbia issued the album in its entirety on CD, rather that chopping it up for another in the seemingly endless stream of Aretha compilation albums.In short, buy the compact disc and give it a few spins. If you are an Aretha fan who has not heard this album, you will be pleased to have another master work in your collection."
1,An insult to Dinah Washington.,"Dinah Washington is was and always will be a great legend, however she sold out in the 60's(meaning she stopped singing jazz and blues)by singing middle of the road muzak like Unforgettable ans all the songs that Miss Franlin is trying to sing. Stay away from this and buy Dinah Washington's ""Dinah Jams"" on EmArcy with Clifford Brown."
2,Wrong choice of material,"Just as ""Queen"" Dinah paid a tribute to ""Empress"" Bessie Smith, young Aretha paid her respect to Dinah on this 1964.album which eventually ended up being just a good intention,but boring as a product.Concentrating too much on Washington's commercially succesful pop period,this album is weighted down with one ballad after another - they all seems to begin and end the same way (dramatical start and gospel finale),the only exception being strong,smashing ""Evil Gal Blues"" where 21-year old Aretha sounds even better than original.This one shining moment shows that the album would be much better if songs were chosen to showcase Aretha's rhytmic potential instead of singing ballads.Its strange to notice how Dinah achieved such a depth of feelings in original versions of excatly same songs,without all those gospel whoops and theatrics - her artistry was all about the feelings and understanding of lyrics."
5,Carmen - film version by Carlos Saura and the Antonio Gades Flamenco dance troup with Christina Hoya.,"We were privileged to see the original dance theatre production in Madrid with the same dance group and still think after 18-19 years that it is one of the highlighjts of all of our trips overseas. We then saw the film of the opera with Placido Domingo,in Nice, and later bought the videos of both productions. The Saura's Carmen has ""done the rounds"" and been most popular with all our friends and has become so faded,it was essential to buy the DVD so we can continue to re-enjoy many repeats in al its original splendour. To anyone interested in flamenco or dance generally I would recommend this portrayal. To others who like good drama and music, raw and passionate, buy it. You wont be disappointed"
2,Wrong Film Format,The film was formatted for European players and not for the US. It did not say this on the listing. I would not have purchased it.
1,Garbage,"I wanted to see the story of Carmen. Instead I saw an incomprehensible ballet story that, according to accompanying blurb, was supposed to be the audition of dancers for a performance of Carmen that mirrored the story of Carmen. More of the dancing was unappealing than not, purposefully awkward and graceless, and I would have had no clue what they were trying to convey if not for the aforementioned blurb. As a matter of fact, I still don't think it looked like what it was said to be. The backdrop was an abstract group of flats painted with large black circles and colored, I assume, by varicolored lights. It had no meaning or relationship to the performance that I could tell. On top of that, they threw in a little gratuitous sexual fondling of breasts and crotches (over clothing) that I found quite pointless. I definitely would NOT recommend this junk."
1,"Wow, way overpriced!!!!","I bought the complete 7 seasons of this show for 60$. THIS IS A MAJOR RIP-OFF!!! This show was really good when it first came out (when I was 7), but bought the entire box set when I was older, and it looks really crappy. Bad acting, really bad special effects, and cheesy. I'd buy it anyway because it was a great show, but 300$?!?! Forget that! Google it, you can get it for waaaay cheaper! Not worth 300$!!!"
3,Similar to Goosebumps,"I loved watching this show when I was young, and it's fun to share it with my kids now. The stories are comparable to the Goosebumps DVDs. My big issue, however, is with the poor quality of the copy. The audio and video are extremely, noticeably out-of-sync. It's very annoying and distracting to watch. Disappointing."
3,They were scarier when I was little...,"I bought this pack for my girlfriend, who's a huge fan. We both remembered them being more scary when we were little, and looking back on it in comparison to modern scary media, these are almost better for comedy value. But, it was fun to watch through and reminisce a little."
1,Seriously? $299 bucks?,I love this show! the only reason i gave this a 1 is because i think this is way too pricey!!!its a great show but this is only just season 1! i would have a hell of a good reason why ishould pay a car payment on this.
2,Why so expensive!!??,"I love this show so much! It made my childhood so much more awesome. I loves all the stories and would love the collection to relive all the fun. However I was taken aback at how expensive one season is! There isn't even that many episodes and it's over $100 dollars!!?? You can get a box set of a series for that much money. For this reason alone I will not be buying it. It's a shame because I love this series, but I cannot justify spending this much money on one little season."
3,Too much black magic,"We didn't finish this as it starts out with a child creating an evil spirit using black magic. We really don't watch occult stuff due to its negative nature. It might tend to encourage more of this as a child not understanding the occult, gets older."
4,Great fun,"My daughter and I (10) turned out the lights, curled up in a chair and watched this together the night before Halloween. It was just great fun."
2,NOT Season 1,"I was so incredibly excited to see that I could buy seasons 1-4 of my favorite childhood show for $5.99 each, rather than track down the very expensive, often non-Region 1 DVD sets. I was crestfallen to see that each 'Season' only includes a small selection of episodes, not the entire season.The show itself will always get five stars, but I can only give this 'Season' two. I was going to give it one, but this is a way to at least get *some* of these amazing episodes.Amazon, step it up and get all of the episodes. We're all more than willing to pay for them!"
5,Excellent,We have two out of the three systems for which this is intended and it works perfectly. You can even charge multiple systems at once. A great product!
3,"Great item, despite it's shortcomings","As you may or may not know from the product picture, this item actually ends in a USB cable on the power side which then connects to a USB to electrical outlet converter, which then plugs into the wall.My USB to Electric Outlet converter broke after one use :(However, you can use this cable with Apple USB power converters (tested myself), and I would assume any type of USB to power hub (not confirmed)Besides that slight problem, it works like a charm. Charge one, two, or three different systems at once, from your computer or wall (if it works, which based on the other product reviews I'd say it usually does).For the price it can't be beat. I've only used it for about 3 weeks at the time of writing this, but in that time its been a delight."
1,Already Broken!,I used this product to charge my son's DS before Christmas. We went to recharge after Christmas and it does not work!
5,Excellent and insightful - opens the mind,"I read this excellent text during my Executive MBA year, and it opened my eyes to the broad and fast evolving services sector. The 8 P's of Services Marketing was particularly memorable, as were the many case studies on how service businesses have innovated to win in the market. Coming from a healthcare background and now in management consulting, I found the frameworks presented very useful in my work, and helped me think through and adapt solutions now for healthcare clients across diverse settings. Highly recommended!"
4,very good service and quality of book,"The book was shipped from U.S. to Ireland. It arrived fast/after 1,5 or 2 weeks. I was surprise by quality of the book; insight was market a little, but that was something I was inform about before purchase. I am very happy from purchase and quality of service and quality of purchased good, will continue to do so.Agnieszka"
4,very informitive,"A very informative book, however it is easy to see that it was written by professors. The book does make basic business subjects more complex than needed."
1,This book is flawed,"This book is another in the long line of people seeking to ""prove"" their faith. The author makes assumption after assumption, none of which is based on anything resembling the science supposedly under investigation, and reaches the conclusion he wanted to reach all along. Plus, it's lame that he got his kid to file a review. LAME."
2,There are much better books on the same subject,"Instead of discussing the impact of disease on society and civilizations, Cartwright speculates about what specific the diseases were that have played an important role in history. This was frustrating, because at best it is pure speculation.For example, Cartwright asks ""Was it syphilis that made Ivan IV ""Ivan the Terrible?"" and ""Did the Bubonic Plague hearld the beginning of the end of feudalism?"" I find such questions moot and pointless. If you are interested in this sort of thing there are several books I recommend over this one. A good introduction is Plagues and Peoples; Alfred Crosby's The Forgotten Epidemic is also excellent (although it is about only a specific epidemic.)"
1,poorly written and poorly substantiated,"I don't understand why this book is a classic or why anyone would give it 5 stars. the book is poorly written. a college freshman writing teacher would groan at the frequency of glibly vague terms, poorly constructed sentences, use of colloquialisms. each chapter is a series of historical tidbits that are not chronologically organized or contextualized. there are no citations or references to the sources of the historical ""facts"". the reader has no way to assess the legitimacy of the information.do not bother with this book."
2,Wake me when it's over...,"I'll keep this brief because I could only stand to watch the first 45 minutes. Then I decided to do something more entertaining so I watered the lawn. If the rest of the film was like the first 45 minutes, I feel very sorry for my wife enduring this thing. I understand that it was actually pretty good, but I just could not finish this one."
5,To Love So Deeply,"I saw this movie long ago, but I just recently read the book so I bought the movie and watched it. I think we would all love to be loved so deeply by another person, and to love as deeply. A lesson learned is to let go of the past in order to move forward, and sometimes that is easier said than done."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money....,"I am so happy that I read the book first. That way, I was able to truly enjoy the way the author of the book, Nicholas Sparks, wanted this truly amazing love story to be portrayed. This movie did not do the book any justice. I did not feel the chemistry of the main characters the same way I felt it in the book. I also believe that the director strayed too far from the actual basis of the story. I could not wait for the movie to be over."
2,The ending spoils the whole movie,"At the end of this movie, I felt ripped-off and betrayed. I had invested 2 hours of my time and emotion on an excellent movie, only to have it spoiled by an awful ending that came out of nowhere. To me the ending of a movie can make or break it. If you agree, don't bother with this movie. If you disagree, see it. The rest of the movie is wonderful - good acting, believable and interesting characters, good story, good pacing. The director should have quit while he was ahead."
1,This movie does no justice to an absolute wonderful book,"This book was one of the most memorable books I have ever read. I cried and was moved beyond words. When I heard there would be a movie, I swore I wouldn't see it because I just knew it wouldn't do the movie justice. Well, was I ever right! I couldn't believe what they did with this movie. Give me a break! If they made the movie with the same story it would have been awesome. Where did this storyline come from? Why can't they leave well enough alone. Kevin Costner put me to sleep -- I know he was a down-home boy but give him some life! The story just did not flow and if you didn't know any background you really wouldn't know what was going on. Very disappointing!"
5,see this with your best girlfriends & a big box of kleenex!,"This is the best movie I've seen all year! I was sobbing the first time, but the second time I was crying even more! This is definately the best romantic movie I've ever seen and it will bring tears to your eyes when you see it. My friend and I practically flooded the movie theatre! :-)"
1,The moview was an injustice to the book,"I wanted to scream at this movie because if you have read the book, you will se that the majority of this story was changed when the movie was made. 1. There was no mention of his first wife family AND THEY DID NOT GET INTO A FIGHT. 2.HE TAUGHT THIS NEW LADY IN HIS HIS LIFE AND HER SON TO SCUBA-DIVE, AND THERE WAS NO MENTION. 3. HE DID NOT DIE BY SAVING SOMEONE OUT IN THE SEA-HE WENT TO DELIVER THE LAST MESSAGE, BUT THE PART OF THE OTHER SHIP THAT WAS SINKING, WAS NOT IN THE STORY. 4. THE FAMILY OF HIS DEAD WIFE DID NOT EVEN FIGHT OR ARGUE OVER HER PAINTINGS, THERE IS NO MENTION OF HER FAMILY!!! I could go on, but when will they ever make a movie and stick to the origional script. Nothig against Kevin C., and the other actors, they are getting paid to do their job, but the monie made me so mad I wanted to stick my foot through the movie screen. TO DO THE RIGHT THING IS TO READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE PLEASE!!!!!!"
4,Sappy love story? Maybe so...,You've come to see a love story and this is exactly what you get.Robin Wright is really good in this one. The chemistry between Costner and Penn's terrific! That's as soon as Costner starts opening up to her.This should get any person that's sensitive enough teary-eyed. If it doesn't do that for you then nothing will!
1,The book was better,Message in a bottle is a story of love and fate. This movie took one of Nicholas Sparks's wonderful book and turned it all around. If you have seen the movie before reading the book and liked it. You should read the book then you'll see what I mean by this is a terrible movie!
1,Movie is a big disappointment,I read the book first and would recommend it over the movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie. It was a great cast who could not portray the emotion and depth required of the characters.
1,Not worth it. At all.,"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! The book was absolutley breath-taking, but the movie is NOTHING like it! i was truly disappointed with the movie and am going to sell my copy of it."
4,Very Good but a VERY disappointing ending,"This movie was so romantic, but then the end comes and you are sooooo disappointed. See this movie and turn it off fifteen minutes early or make up your own ending(like I did)."
1,Left feeling Empty,"I like romantic movies. I want the ending to leave me feeling happy, not depressed. Life isn't the fairy tale, thats why I watch movies, otherwise I wouldn't waste my time watching them. I want the fairy tale, the things that could and would never happen in real life. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE, until the end, I even stayed up on a work night until 1:30am. If they created this ending to make the movie ""more realistic"" they failed miserably. I thought I found a new romantic chick flick to add to my collection, I was sorely disappointed."
2,What's the big deal?,"This is one of those movies that EVERYONE says you should see, so I finally watched it, but I can't say that I was impressed.The plot was predictable and Penn's acting was just so-so... Both Costner & Newman gave strong performances, though, and I liked the character played by Robbie Coltrane. The movie just doesn't have a strong enough story for me to want to see it again or recommend it."
5,Can not go wrong with a Costner movie,"I was surprised by the ending, did not expect him to die in the end, very good love story. recommend it to friends."
2,Seriously?,"Just finished this movie and must say I'm DISAPPOINTED to say the least! I thought this was a feel good movie, it so completely is not, and its not even a good tear jerker! At the end I felt no emotion except anger at such an ending. I never write reviews but I just had to for this.The only thing that I'll remember fondly is Newman."
5,Movie,"Love this movie! I think you are asking for much to much, especially since you have asked me over and over!"
2,"Beautiful scenery, interesting premise, but.......","What starts as an intesting idea becomes fairly predictable..... When will he find out?.....How mad will he be???... Will he forgive?.... However, the later scene with Costner in the boat upon the stormy sea is of the quality one would expect from All My Children. The ending ruined what was a harmless, enjoyable film"
3,Watchable,"I just finished watching this movie. It was interesting enough to hold my attention this one time, but I can't imagine wanting to own it and watch it again.It was pretty predictable. I knew Costner's character, would find that bottle in Theresa's apartment. You could feel that coming from the start.Rent this one, don't buy it."
4,It captivated me.....swept me into another place. Excellent,I first watched this movie by myself on a rainy afternoon by the end of the weekend my friends and I watched it again ooood and awwwwd the romance. (True romance is when you don't sleep with each other the first date or second or third) I glowed all over from watching this movie. A true love story.At first I did not like the ending because I was wanting a they lived happily ever after...I question why they refer to North Carolina as the base but yet the movie was filmed in Maine.....Kevin Costner is excellent in this film....I wander how he is in real life and Paul Newman is as sexy now as he ever was!!!!!I am buying the soundtrack the music swept me away too!!!!!Why cant real life be this romantic????
3,"Costner plays stoic quite recluse, a real stretch","Yes it is the same role as the Mariner, the Postman, Wyatt Earp, A Perfect World and others Costner has played. The good news is it works here too. This is an endearing story of a woman (Robyn Wright Penn) who discovers a message in a bottle. It is a goodbye letter to Costner's wife after she has died. She is instantly attracted to the poet author of the note, and seeks him out. He turns out to be a ship builder who lives alone except for visits from his father, another powerful performance from Paul Newman. This is a fairy tale like story, but with a darkly ironic ending which turned me off. Of course it's not the first love story to end in such a way, but then I never like it when it does."
4,MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,"I found this movie absolutely fascinating;the story was a typical romance. It explored the human emotion and curiosity that we all feel when we find an insight into another person's relationship. Kevin Costner was your typical man of the sea and portrayed a man not ready to move on with his life after the tragic loss of his partner. It took someone like Robyn Penn Wright to stir the deeply hidden emotions but even then she could not compare to his lost love. She gave him inspiration and made him dig deep to find his true self. Paul Newman was superb as the crusty kindly father and without his inclusion in the film, be it as a supporting role, a lot of the emotion would hasve been lost. The pain suffered by the inlaws at the loss of their daughter was so true to life when someone they love dies so tragically. All in all the scenery was superb and the DVD is recommended"
5,Excellent love story,I love this movie it was my first time watching this and it was recommend by my husband it's a great love story. I love movies that has a story line like this one. it is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Great actors and it was a directed beautifully..... Most see
5,Heart Stopping Messages,"the movie was amazing, of course nothing like the book but if you didnt read the book i highly reccommend this movie. i loved it even tho i read the book first."
2,whoa--predictable,"This movie didn't hold my interest. Finding the message in the bottle was exciting, fun, romantic. But when Theresa went to find the mystery man and conveniently started a relationship with him without telling him the truth of why she was there (checking out the mysterious message in a bottle writer), I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie, and I was right. There were lots of other predictable situations as well, creating melodrama and way too many tears without grabbing my sentiments. She was supposed to be a serious journalist but spent her time at the Outer Banks as if she were on vacation. Thumbs down."
2,Not anywhere near as good as the book.,"They changed SO much from the book to the movie version! Paul Newman's character as the father had his name changed, as well as Theresa's son; Garrett already had a boat, he did not have to build one; his wife was not a painter; Theresa lived in Boston and worked for a fictional newspaper; etc. The movie just lacked so much. There was zero chemistry between the main characters. Kevin Costner was the only wonderful part in the movie as he played the character of Garrett so perfectly that it felt like they stole him right from the pages of the book and breathed life into him to star in the movie. He is the reason to watch this movie - there aren't any other reasons. Read the book - you'll get a more satisfying experience and a more satisfying cry."
3,Romantic,"The plot of this movie was simply beautiful, especially coming from brilliant Nicholas Sparks. The movie was sweet and subtle showing the relationship between a man and a woman.A woman is a writer, and finds a bottle written with a very beautiful note. She wants to find the author of the notes and possibly write a story on him.She does meet him, and ironically falls in love with him. She collects the notes any way she can loving him even more. While on her journey, she spends a lot of time with the new man she's fallen in love with.She has to leave to be with her son who was with his dad over the holiday. Problems arise, and hardships are endured.The novel and movie are both very touching and romantic."
3,"Great Story, but.......","I was told by alot of friends that I should read the book""Message in a Bottle"". I said sure why not, I could use a good read. People were literally raving about this book. So, I read it in record time. I could not put down this book!!!!!!!Nicholas Sparks does an EXCELLENT job with the story. And I haven't mentioned what I thought of the movie because it didn't even come close to the book in any aspect. I guess I should have watched the movie first...but even if you have seen the movie, I highly recommend that you read the book! It will make you laugh, cry and love such a great love story!!"
3,Nice but...,"The story is so nice, Kevin Costner as so good and the movie as a whole is worth watching but...What I did not like about this movie is the actress Robin Wright, I wish Julia Roberts played this role instead of Robin. Robin acting, looks nor expressions are suitable for this film!Plus the movie gets a little bit boaring in the middle...But still it is a good movie... I LOVED THE STORY!"
5,A must see for the Kevin Costner fans.,"I watched the movie before I read the book and I loved them both. The movie was so moving and beautifully written that I decided to buy the book. I couldn't put the book down. I would recommend seeing the movie and reading the book, in any order that you want. Kevin Costner is so sexy and made the movie one that I am going to buy as soon as it comes out."
3,Great story ~ an O.K. adaption for the screen.,"The book was hard to put down. The story was wonderful. The movie left out some of the details from the book and invented others. (Typical of book to movie translations). However, it is a movie I will probably see again."
4,Thought movie must better than book,"I really do. I think that the changes in the movie made the story line much better. To me, it made the movie a more powerful love story. I loved it and can't wait to buy it when it is released."
3,A okey-good romance,"A very sweet Love Story and very beautiful scerny nut some plots,and some not that intresting scenes, makes it a dry but an worthy movie. B ***"
4,WONDERFUL,"I READ THE BOOK BEFORE I SAW THE MOVIE, I CRIED BOTH TIMES. THEY COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A BETTER CAST THAN THEY DID -- YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT AND ALSO READ THE BOOK."
1,"If you read the book, don't rent the video","I read the book twice. The movie has been changed so much you won't even recognize it. They even changed Theresa's son's name, for what reason I cannot imagine. You will be terribly disappointed if you are expecting a romantic widower in Kevin Costner's portrayal of Garrett. They turned him into this bitter crotchety jerk. A silly subplot about Garrett and a feud with Catherine's family has been added, again, I cannot imagine why, unless the producers were looking to fill space. I did not care for Robin Wright Penn's portrayal of Theresa. There wasn't any chemistry. At the end there is a needless death. You will be staring at the screen thinking, Why in the world did they do THAT? Don't waste your money on this one! You will be sorely disappointed."
2,Not believable,"For a love story to work, you have to believe that the characters are in love. I never quite buy it in this movie. Robin Wright Penn's usual brilliance and believability can't overcome the stupid plot. And it doesn't help that Kevin Costner comes across as, not merely pining away for his lost love, but mentally challenged. Paul Newman is the best thing in this film. In a movie crammed full of scenes intended to bring viewers to tears, the only one that even came close, for me, was Paul Newman's ""You're my son"" scene.Skip this failed attempt and watch Sleepless in Seattle or Forrest Gump instead."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Not a big fan of Kevin Costner since he's not the most exciting actor to watch, but this role really suited him. A simple man who learns it's possible to find love twice in life. Wish the ending was different though."
3,boring,"boring, boring, boring, boring,expected more from Costner, however, nice location, Paul Newman...good, but story line just boring. and Costner was weak as the main actor, acting ok, but character wishy washy"
1,Low budget much?,"I've read the book and I must say that the novel is excellent. This movie is anything but. The entire movie I couldn't help but notice the low quality/budget of the camera work and the 'cg' scenes looked like they'd been shot in the 80's. There were times where background music was much needed to help pump some emotion into the scenes because there was quite the lack of it coming from the actors/actresses and then there were times where the music just blared out and caused more of a scene than the characters.As others have stated, I can't believe I sat down for two hours and kept thinking to myself that it would get better. I would've rather just fallen asleep on the couch with my dog. Now that would've been more entertaining."
2,Don't have too high of hopes...,"Well, as much as I loved the book - and we all know that movies are never as good as the books - I'd have to say that this movie really dissapointed me. By the time I got done - it took me three hours because I kept stopping it and contrasting it to the book - I was very upset. It doesn't stick true to the novel. Now, I'm not saying that it should go word for word like the novel, but it doesn't even end the same. Penn and Costner were good, and their acting of the poorly adapted screen play was acurate, but I think the person who adapted this novel should have been fired for taking the heart and soul of this movie and killing it. If you are desperate for a love story, and they don't have ""A Walk To Remember"" by Sparks... Pick it up. Just don't expect it to stay true to the novel."
2,Fabulous Movie....,"... but only if you are deaf. Seriously. This movie is visually gorgeous. That's about it. The actual message found in the bottle should be enough to make you go right to mute. Then, if you are not deaf, maybe put on some Chopin Nocturns and enjoy 2 hours of beautiful cinematography."
2,a beautiful romantic story ruined in its dramatization.,"I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THIS BOOK WAS DRAMATIZED, THE TELLING OF THE STORY DIDN'T DRAW ME INTO IT SO THAT I COULD FEEL THE EMOTION WHICH I FELT WHEN READING THE BOOK. MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE WAS KEVIN COSTNER AT HIS WORST. HE DIDN'T SEEM CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTER HE PLAYED AT ALL, BUT TO SPARE HIM SOMEWHAT, I BELIEVE THE THE DIRECTON OF THE MOVIE WAS WANTING TOO, AND THEREFORE, WEAKENED HIS CHARACTER CONSIDERABLY.I HAD SO MUCH ANTICIPATED SEEING THE MOVIE AFTER READING THE BOOK, AND THEN TO SEE WHAT HAD BEEN FILMED, DEMONSTRATED HOW A STORY CAN BE LOST IN ITS TRANSITION IF NOT HANDLED ARTISTICALLY."
5,Big Fan of Nicholas Sparks,"This is a great movie. Read the book, loved it.Disc in great shape and received it very timely."
4,NOT A THREE LINE Phone!!!,"Beware, per Panasonic's website, this is a ONE line phone. Still, I own several Panasonic cordless phones and they are quite simply THE BEST there is. After spending years with other brands, Panasonic definitely won me over and continues to do so."
1,Lousy Service,"Ordered from Chumbadeals for a Christmas present on 7 Dec when it was labeled as ""in stock ships immediately."" On 19 Dec. amazon.com let me know that the order had not even been confirmed by the vendor and that I should contact the company directly. I did. This was their reply:""Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for your order.Due to the volume of orders during this time of year, we are sold out of this item. We are unaware when this item will be in stock again. Therefore we have cancelled your order.We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.Customer ServiceChumbadeals.com""If it wasn't for amazon's follow-through, I would not have known and I seriously doubt the vendor would have notified me. So kudos to amazon and a big thumbs down to Chumbadeals."
1,???,"Very basic dictionary for ... tourists maybe?. It's OK! I made a mistake when I thought it could serve my purposes. On the other hand shipping was great, came faster than expected and in excellent conditions."
3,Zoe is great but the movie is not very cohesive,"I was looking forward to seeing Zoe Bell, the stuntwoman, in a dramatic role, especially with a great action filmmaker like Quentin Tarentino at the helm. But the first part of the move and the second part do not mesh together well. It's unfortunately like two separate stories with some parallel themes and one common denominator psycho killer character (Kurt Russell).Give Zoe some acting lessons and she's gonna burn up the screen doing her own stunts and bringing her own special flair.Well photographed! A little self indulgent. Still enjoyable."
5,Tarantino pays tribute to muscle cars and 70's grindhouse films,We the viewers get the full grindhouse treatment with scratches hair fuzz and missing reels.Psycho stalks and kills with stunt cars as his weapon of choice.Great cast and humour.
3,mixed bag,"My feelings about this movie are mixed. There were looooooong stretches of pointless (and frankly boring) dialogue. When the girls are in the car or sitting around the table, for example. To me those scenes were weakest. The girls were really supposed to know each other. But a lot of times, they talked as if they were introducing themselves to each other. It just wasn't very convincing so it tended to drag in those spots. There were bright spots though. Near the end it got exciting when the tables were turned. And I liked the stylishness of it."
2,Why?,"As part of the ""Grindhouse"" experience this was great fun but, by itself, it's only a small portion of the whole. Putting it out in two DVDs is a cheap ploy to get your cash. It makes me think very little of the film makers supposed ""aesthetic"".In a year, when they put out the whole thing, I may go back and buy it, but, right now, this is a bad idea. I can't reccomend it."
2,So much for authenticity... can you say ripoff?,"First I should say, I absolutely loved seeing Grindhouse in the theater as it was meant to be seen. The dvd destroys the whole experience. First off, the trailers, for some stupid, unknown reason, are gone. The special features have trailers for new hollywood movies. The added deleted scenes add nothing to the movie, some are even annoying, particularly the lap dance scene. The dvd packaging is nothing to write home about either. There was absolutely no reason to separate Death Proof from Planet Terror. If you enjoy paying more money for less, you are a moron. I will not buy Planet Terror, I'll just grab a bootleg copy of the theatrical version of the the complete film(s). You should to."
4,quality was good,"stream was good , movie was good... lots of good looking women in the film , kurt russel is always top knotch"
1,Download,This is a good movie but you have to get online to watch it or download a whole nother player to your computer. No i wont buy anymore digital downloads from amazon
3,Sometimes entertaining,"Sometimes entertaining film. I thought the first half was stronger than the second half. Too much girl dialogue in the 2nd half caused the film to drag a bit. Alot of action, cute dialogue, but no plot (which is usual for a Tarantino movie). Kurt Russell does a good job. If you like Tarantino, you'll probably like this movie. Don't expect too much; I didn't."
2,Extra scenes are dull. Need original version!!!,"This movie should have been 45 mins shorter. The endless and vacuous girl talk may appeal to some, but not to me. The action scenes are superb, but the viewer has to wait for nearly 50 mins until something happens! I didn't see this at the theater and regret it sorely. This movie was surely better as the 2nd part of the ""Grindhouse"" and ALOT shorter!!!! This DVD is simply a highly cynical exercise in squeezing money from a flop movie and does the movie and the artists who created it no justice whatsoever."
2,Such a disappointment...,"As a big Tarantino fan and a gear head, I was looking forward to this, thinking it would be a slick and exciting car chase movie. Then I started watching the film, and what I saw was a two hour movie that was an hour and forty five minutes of filler and fifteen minutes of an average car chase. The scenes of dialogue between the victims, and later on the heroines, drag on forever with absolutely no plot building (mostly because there is no plot to build in the first place), and when the scenes with the cars finally roll around they just aren't worth the wait. And what's more, at the end of the movie I was actually feeling sorry for the villain. Yes, Stuntman Mike killed four girls in the movie and tried to kill three more, but the heroines were just so slimy (I actually felt like taking a shower after their dialogue scenes). All that being said, Death Proof might have been a decent movie if it was a half hour shorter."
2,Disappointing!,"The fact that this film was all dialog didn't bother me. Hell, I loved ""My Dinner with André"".The problem was that the talk just wasn't interesting.I'm a Kurt Russell fan and mostly a Tarantino fan, but this film was dull except for the ten minutes following the ""wrong turn"" in the first half.The second half never approached the intensity of those 10 min, so there was no payoff for me for enduring the interminable yap, yap, yapping of the first two-thirds of the second half.Zoe Bell was charismatic and appealing, but even together with Russell, who's great as usual (I did like his interpretation of the character when the chips were down; nice touch), they couldn't overcome the intrinsic dullness of the script.This flick had maybe 30 min of good material. The rest had me yawning and reaching for the FF button."
1,Extremely boring,I've always enjoyed Tarantino's movies but this one is just an excuse to show girls in tight clothing and... that's it. Extremely boring.
1,BORRRRING. Snooze,"I tried to watch this film 3 times and was bored to sleep. Watch this film if you want to hear boring dialogue that continues on and on. I didn't care about anyone in the film. I was hoping they would die, I never finished it so I can't tell you if they did. Planet Terror was a million times better. Now THAT was a good film."
1,in a word............YAP,multiply that by a quadrillion and youd get the 1st half of this crap.2nd half more of the same.roll credits.i read how fan boys mention great sceneS yet dont actually describe them.ill do it for them (lazy fan boys !)......scene 1)ends the 1st yap session with a bored kurt running over 4 of cinemas most annoying group of noise-makers ive ever had the pleasure of falling asleep to.scene 2)a car chase that didnt make sense.all the broads had to do was STOP THE CAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!! what could have kurt do but bump into them ?!?!?!?!? stopping at least would have let that stunt chic get in.it also ends laughingly so whatever ''coolness'' or ''awesomeness'' there was was ruined.fan boys praise this for whatever imagined reason/s they need but it wont be truthful.this was horrible and any other director would have been kicked in the face for making such a POS.this isnt a horror movie and it lacks action so ........
2,This Movie Is Too Boring To Be So Long,"I like some of Tarantino's films (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown), but this movie was very dull. The entire first half of the film takes place in a bar where everyone is drinking and getting stoned. The second half takes place at diner with a bunch of pointless girl talk. The action scenes are few. I was bored out of mind and wondered when this movie was going to be over. This movie wasn't that great."
3,"Fun, But Too Twisted And Gory For Me","You can look at the director's name and cover artwork on the CD and know what you're in for. Still, it had it's entertaining moments, but only in a juvenile male sort of way. Zoe Bell was a horrendous actress even though the special features touted her as an upcoming novelty star. Some memorable scenes, but probably only watched it because I was stuck at home sick with a cold. This one might be better with alcohol and some rowdy friends."
4,"grindhouse ""death proof""","I probably liked it better than Grindhouse ""Planet Terror"". Interesting & gory. My boyfriend wanted it for Christmas. Arrived on time & in perfect condition."
4,A pedal to the metal blast of b-movie love.,"Death Proof is a pedal to the metal, bad-a** homage to b-movies that is an absolute blast to watch. What makes the movie so good is that Quentin Tarantino ground his beloved ""Grindhouse"" movies to a pulp, found the essence of what he loves, and turned it into something completely unique and compelling to watch. Death Proof does drag a bit at times and gets a bit too absorbed in dialog, but you will be well rewarded for your patience. The plot builds towards the film's final twenty minutes, which contains one of the greatest car chases that I have ever seen recorded on film. Recommended for all QT fans."
1,Don't Bother,My husband and I were so excited to see this movie but we couldn't have been more disappointed by this film. It was so bad that we decided not to buy the dvd for our collection of Quentin Tarantino films. Don't bother! The girl characters are annoying and it is so longwinded. I wanted them to just be quiet!
1,Good if you like this kind of thing.,"There's little reason to wonder why this tanked so badly at the box-office. Grindhouse movies did lousy business back in the 70's, so there's really no reason to expect that they'd do any better thirty years later. ""Death Proof"" is the nadir of Tarantino's fixation with the 70's, and indeed, comes off as a parody of his own work. Long, pointless, (and surprisingly boring) scenes of people sitting around talking lead up to two mediocre chase scenes. If you liked the movie, then you already went to see it, so go ahead and buy the DvD. If you haven't seen the movie, there's probably a reason, and there's nothing about the DvD that will suddenly make you a fan."
1,A Tarantino Turkey,"This is Quentin Tarantino's worst movie by a large margin. Only six killings, two action sequences, no gratuitous nudity, and over a hundred minutes of mindless dialog. I'm glad the DVD release didn't pair this turkey with the awesome movie, Planet Terror. What a disappointment!"
1,I want both movies and the fake trailers,Hey I'll pay the bucks just put the movies together like they were in the theater with the fake trailers and all. Thank you and goodnight
1,Zoe Bell gets 5 stars,"The only thing approaching entertainment and excitment in this film is Zoe Bell. When she is on the hood of that car, I couldn't take my eyes off the action. The rest of the film is boring endless chick talk."
1,You don't know how right you are...,"...here in Germany both flicks have already been separated and released individually for their THEATRICAL release. And at least in the case of Death Proof, the result sucks big time. Without even knowing the (shorter) US version, after the show the audience was leaving with a feeling of having seen a picture that had simply been one hour too long. This is a serious advice: do not spend your hard earned moneys on the extended version. As a matter of fact I was here hoping to get the short version, but without luck as it seems..."
1,Sucks. Hands down.,"Whoever loved this movie and who was a complete fan, as I was, will be thoroughly disappointed. The whole ""Back-in-time"" cinematic experience of seeing a REAL Grindhouse in theatres was the whole point of this film.Who the hell will want to buy them seperately, and NOT EVEN AT THE SAME TIME, withOUT the hilarious trailers and commercials in between?I have lost all respect in Rodriguez and Tarantino. They should have known better. They are complete hypocrites for doing this to themselves and their fans.I hope they lose money over this.The whole thing was amazing. F*** buying this in two seperate parts.I'm getting a bootleg copy of the cinema version, no matter what extremes I have to go to to find it."
2,big dissapointment,"i'm a big fan of tarantinos work and really wanted to love this movie.. everyone is right that except for the car chases and basically any scene with stuntman mike the movie is boring, lame , the ending is stupid.. i liked it better when tarantino made movies for guys ... girls talking about and Italian womens magazine is not keeping my interest. sorry"
1,lousy dvd ripoff ....a bootleg ...,this was a bootleg dvd and a very poor quality one at that! only music for sound scratchy jumpy film and no sound for talking...i'm reporting amazon for dealing in stolen goods. as this is a double theft .. from me and from the film maker
2,Why no English subtitles?,"As much as Tarantino loves to over indulge himself by writing way too much dialogue in his films (this being his worst), I'm surprised he never has English subtitles for his DVD's.Oh, well.I would give the film itself 3 stars, but I took one star away for the Weinstein's separating this film from Planet Terror and all of the great trailers (which won't even be on the Planet Terror disc!). I'm sure there's a double-dip on the horizon?"
1,You have got to be kidding?,"Watching Death Proof is an excercise in patience as this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Judging by the writer/director and how good Planet Terror was, I thought Death Proof would be a blast to watch. I was wrong and therefore subjected to about 100 minutes of alleged actors blab their way through this film. I guess its called character development which went the way of the DoDo in the first 2 minutes. The scenes with the cars were bordering on idiotic and again we are subjected to a pile of dialogue by the actors. Whats Quentins thing with womens feet in almost every movie he made?If you own Death Proof on DVD use the case as an ashtray or coaster. If not, save your money and definitely two hours of your life and watch a test pattern instead."
4,Oops,"Quintin Tarintino cheated. He was supposed to make a b movie and he accidentally made a great one. Great car chase, great dialogue, great acting, not exactly what a b movie entails."
1,Could have been much more,"This film was stylistically riveting for the first 30 minutes or so ... but after I got used to the groovy retro-style of filming (weird 70s colors, familiar t.v.-cop-show angles), I started looking around for a plot. I found none. I started looking for characters I cared about. Again, I found none. The best moment was when Rose ""Homewrecker"" McGowan got smushed against the windshield. Downhill from there. Wait for it to come on HBO so you won't feel bad about spending your money."
5,Disappointment...,"I absolutely loved the movie, ""Grindhouse"".It's sad that they had to break the release into two separate DVDs.I won't be buying either until they release the box set with the faux trailers included.After all, that's what the definition of a grindhouse is, isn't it? Two or more cheesy movies for one?"
1,Unbearable,Pretentious doesn't really cover it. This is a terrible movie. I couldn't even make it to the action which I assume is in the second half. I have only walked out or cut short a few movies in my life. This is one of them. Amazon needs a zero rating. This should never have been made.
1,Not filmed in Tennessee - get with it,"When the Mustang pulls in the package store in "" Lebanon, Tennessee"" locally pronouncd Lebbnin by the way, the signs advertise liquor and beer.Everyone knows liquor and beer can not be sold in the same store in this state - idiots !Lots of silly girl talk - with one somewhat decent chase scene."
1,yawn...,"For an exploitation flick this one sure is slow. Plenty of mindless banter and girl talk but little action. The car chase at the end is great if you can stay awake for it. Pass on this and go for one of the films it emulates like Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, or just watch the far superior Planet Terror."
4,death proof,i saw this movie at the movie theaters and it was good butt most people have average of IQ of 115 to enjoy this movie you need IQ above 140 other wise little ignorant small brain idiots wont like this movie.
2,Death Proof...more like Fun Proof!!,This movie is one boring chick flick5 minutes into the movie i gave upThe 2 star rating is for Rosario DawsonShe's hot!!
1,Gordon Gekko said it best. . .,". . .""Greed is good."" And the Brothers' Weinstein know it by heart. The double feature tanked in the theaters because Miramax didn't take the time to educate the general public as to the delight these films were. After the first week, Harvey & Bob were whining to the press, already talking about how they were going to pull it and re-release them separately. Good press and patience would have made this incredible piece of film making a hit. So now they have their chance to release the films separately and see that the die hard film geeks will wait. Patience will win out and greed will get the best of them - this will be released as shown, eventually, and I am willing to wait. When will the home video arm of the studios realize that fans want extras, original material, that little extra something?"
1,Do it do it do it now,"I'm gonna have to wait. I'll pay for the full thing, but damn you Weinsteins, you've got your marketing all twisted up. You should've released an expensive all in one disc that way people could buy it for their relatives and people could get into it that way, the full Grindhouse experience on the big screen. But you made a full of everyone Harvey Weinstein, what have you done?"
1,TERRIBLE!!!,I would have given 0 stars if I could - one of the worst films I have ever witnessed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
1,Complete Disgust,I have to agree with 99% of the writers out there. This is such an obvious sellout it's amazing. I can't remember a bigger screw up than this. The only thing that comes even close is the first time the major networks played Midnight Cowboy and cut out approximately 40 minutes of the movie. I may never watch another Tarantino Movie again.
3,i want the real grindhouse too,YES I AGREE I WOULD ALSO WANT THE REAL GRINDHOUSE TOO.JUST AS IT WAS RELEASED IN THEATRES.AFTER SEEING IT SIX TIMES IN THEATRES.I WOULD LIKE TO OWN GRINDHOUSE JUST LIKE IT CAME OUT.IF THE POWERS THAT BE RELEASES DEATH PROOF PLEASE RELEASE IT WITH THE TRAILERS AND ADVERTISINGS JUST LIKE IT WAS WHEN RELEASED IN THEATRES THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE SATISFIED.IF IT WAS UP TO ME I WOULD GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.IWOULD RELEASE GRINDHOUSE JUST LIKE IT IS WITH A TRUCKLOAD OF SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDING TRAILERS TV SPOTS RADIO SPOTS INTERNET SPOTS.AUDIO COMMENTARIES.DELETED SCENES MISSING REELS DOCUMANTARIES EVERYTHING.GRINDHOUSE IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN THIS YEAR.
1,Sherlock Holmes could not have found the plot to this movie.,"I tried to watch this movie. I really did. But I lost interest about ten minutes into it, and ended up zoning it out unwillingly all three times I've sat down in front of it. What plot there may be is boring, copied stuff, and it's not very well-written. I did not like any of the characters, and the action scenes were average for the genre. It was a total waste of time for me to attempt to watch this movie--I wish I could get those hours back. Pass on this one; there are hundreds of better movies out there."
1,The one star goes to the car chase scenes.,"I'm watching it now and my initial reaction in the theater is much magnified. This movie has the worse dialogue I have ever heard. It's worse than an eighties sitcom or an after-school special. It's worse than most of the movies I cable-surf every weekend. What women talk like this? And as I listen to it go and on, who cares?Reservoir Dogs = brilliant dialogueSamuel Jackson and John Travolta = brilliant dialogueKill Bill (both movies) = sparse but effective dialogueThe dialogue in this movie makes my ears bleed. On to the car chase, please. Hurry!"
1,Yaaaaaaaaawn,"I remember those 70's drive-in movies andQuentin Tarantino did a great job at makinga horrible movie.I kept wanting to fast forward tothe good parts, but then found out that theonly good part was stunt-woman Zoe Bell ridingthe hood of the car.Now if we were only charged $1.50 and could sneakin a couple freinds in the truck of the car, wellthen this may just be worth ZOE BELL riding thathood (over and over and over and over again.)Otherwise, it's not!This makes 'Death Race 2000' look like a Oscar worthy film."
1,Not Buying It !!!!,"The single star is for the DVD & not the movie itself (which I would give 4 stars to ).If the WHINEsteins intention of splitting this film in two wasnt soley for the purpose of squeezing as much $$$$ out of the DVD purchasing public as possible , I have a real simple solution for them :Release the unrated/extended/loaded w/ extras half-versions , waitaminuteherecomesthegoodpart .........AND....... the theatrical version .....at the SAME TIME !!!!!Wow ! What a novel idea ! Give the fans an actual choice ! I cant believe they didnt think of such a simple solution themselves .Its not like there arent multiple version of other DVDs when they are released .Oh and for the record , I am not boycotting , I am just patiently waiting for the DVD version of the way this film (singular) was meant to be viewed .If you want to wave your copies of these bastardized half-films in my face , be my guest ."
3,AN HOMAGE TO THE GRINDHOUSE FILMS,"An homage to grindhouse films of the 70s. In fact if it wasn't for the cell phones I'd presume this whole thing was set in the 70s with the cars, tacky hairstyle and 70s outfits. Kurt Russel plays a driving serial killer who likes to terrorize attractive women. The first time around you see the brutality of what he can do but in the next chapter he's up for a big surprise as the girls fight back. The side conversations by the girls and the ending put this grade up a notch. There is a planned sequel. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; ACTION/HORROR ELEMENTS: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."
2,Rent it before buying it.,"If you're a fan of Tarantino rent it, then buy it if you like it. Personally, I think it's the weakest of the two Grindhouse films, and of Tarantino's films."
2,Well made but dull,"Death Proof has a simple concept. Kurt Russell plays a stunt man who has rigged his souped-up car with roll bars and other safety devices so that during an accident it will be ""death proof"". He then travels the south looking for attractive young women he can terrorize and kill with said car. The movie is broken into 2 parts with Kurt stalking one group of 4 women, then starting over with another group.Death Proof is photographed beautifully, acted well and has some interesting dialogue but overall is very boring. The only part that leaves a lasting memory is a head-on car crash shown over and over from different angles. It takes about 45 minutes to get to the crash and its over in 15 seconds. Tarantino is so enthralled with the dialogue he wrote he lets the movie meander around like it's out for a Sunday stroll which is boring to watch."
2,"too much talk and 2 ""action""scenes","Quick review, i love Kurt Russel and that was the only reason i watched this movie. The first 35 minutes are several women talking and that is it. Finally Kurt comes on as Stuntman Mike, you would think all the talking the women do would further the plot but it doesn't. He talks to them at a bar get's a lap dance then well let's just say there is about 8 minutes of bloody action. After that it switched to ANOTHER set of women talking for another 30 minutes. Turns out 2 of the girls are stunt women and one has a gun. They get into a cool car chase with Mike then *spoiler* either knock him out or kill him you can't tell. Then the end. So quick summary, 2 hour movie, 2 action scenes that are total 15 minutes long and the rest is talking, cussing and boring. Maybe watch it on t.v. one of these days for the 2nd car chase and save yourself some time, yawn."
2,"Deathproof, Deathly Boring","I like Quentin Tarantino movies but ""Deathproof"" was a drag...unless you like watching good looking women curse, get drunk and act like twits. A particular scene at a diner came off as an actor's exercise--how many times can you use the n-word, the s-word and the b-word in a conversation. Extra bonus points for using the f-word as an adjective.These women weren't even discussing anything relevant to the story. Yes, the scene where the three beauties beat psycho Stuntman Mike at his own game was terrific but the slog you had to go through to get there hardly made it worth the payoff.I was really disappointed in this DVD and the fact that the fake trailers weren't included was another insult."
5,Awesome little bonus.,"I found this at Best Buy, so I was like what the heck? A nice metal case with a special bonus disc, It's very cool if you are a Tarantino lover. The bonus disc has at least 25 minutes of footage featuring cool facts about both Grindhouse halves, spoken from Rodriguez & Tarantino. I found this DVD to be a nice package. Hope you do too!"
2,Death Proof but not Sleep Proof,"I saw the Grindhouse movie combo at the theaters and had a great time with Planet Terror. Death Proof should have been shown first because it was such a very s-l-o-w, long and drawn out movie as to put one to sleep.Y-a-w-n.It finally built to a great, climactic ending that was awesome and finally made the movie sort-of worth watching."
5,Death Proof!!!,"I loved it, im a huge Quentin Tarantino films, and i have all of them on dvd.I liked Grindhouse a lot, i saw the theather version and loved it, although PLANET TERROR was noisier and had more action, i liked DEATH PROOF more, the final minutes are amazing.I know people are dissapointed about the GRINDHOUSE movie being split, , but what am i going to do, just buy the two dvds.The movie itself is great, great acting, fun conversations, great action sequences and i think its one of the most originals movies i have seen recently.Just the final frame with THEN END was worth the movie.The movie itself (grindhouse) was great. and im excited about the extended version of Death proof, wich was my favorite from the two.I just whished this movie could originate more original movies, because by far, this is one of the best of the year for me"
1,One of the worst ever.,"Some may call this movie an homage, but to me its just a gimmick that doesn't work. The stylized presentation and too clever dialogue cannot hide the fact that this movie is just plain boring. Of course Tarantino pulls his one trick out of the bag, gore, for a brief appearance toward the end. But by then I was itching to push the FF button and get through this dog. Kurt Russell was the only decent part of this whole project and it was a shame his talent was wasted."
1,BOYCOTT ALL THE WAY!!!,"I never saw the movie in the theaters, and really looked forward to the back-to-back ""proper"" viewing (with fake trailers in all the right places). So I'm not shelling out more money for two versions when the whole NOVELTY of this project was ONE DOUBLE-FEATURE. It's such a blatant f-you to the fans of this movie that we as fans have to choice but to give them the same treatment in return. Anybody who reads this, I urge you to stand by the boycott of this release."
2,They have RUINED a great movie!,"The original Grindhouse was one of the best movies EVER. But now it has been cut up and RUINED! I was counting down for it to come out on dvd but when I heard this I was FURIOUS! If they would have cut it in two but left all the fake trailers and movie ads, ect. I could overlook the 2 dvd format and it could still be great. The fake ads were the best part for me. That was the beauty of the movie. It broke the usual format. It was so much fun! The combination of everything together was the very essence of this movie. Now without the fake ads, ect. it won't be the roller coaster ride that it was in the theater. This is a TRAVESTY! I'll look for a bootleg of the original! QT and RR are usually excellent but this is ridiculous. Yeah it bombed at the box office but that is because it was too cool for the average idiot! If they would have left it alone I think it would have made up some of the money in dvd sales, but now... This was a stupid move."
1,"Great movie, but won't buy it","Saw this in the theater. Loved it. After reading it is split up and the trailers are gone, won't buy it. Whoever is responsible for this decision is stupid. I looked forward to seeing this again in its original form on DVD and this is what they do. I'm not interested in the extra scenes. I'm interested in seeing this the way it was in the theater, i.e. two movies, fake trailers. I don't know why this flopped in theaters because it was great in its original format, but I hope these dual DVD releases sans fake trailers fail miserably. This was a bad, bad decision. I'm very disappointed."
1,This is WRONG,This is soooo wrong. Anyone that buys Death Proof or Planet Terror separately is just supporting corporate greed. Grindhouse was intended as one movie experience. Don't let them get away with this. DO NOT buy these movies separately.
1,Death Proof should NOT be part of the Grindhouse Experience!!!,"This movie was/is extremely boring! You wait around for something to happen and you only get two awesome car-chasin' scenes, the rest is girls talking about random stuff. Stick with PLANET TERROR! It's A LOT better!!!"
3,Better as a shorter movie,Quentin Tarantino's style is cool and I really love the references to great movies of the past but this movie was more about how the movie is made than what it's about. Stunt-man Kurt added class to the movie. The girls were hot but in the end Kurt wimps and the girls get ugly. Worth seeing but only barely. Bonus features are interesting. It's heart breaking to see so many 70's era cars destroyed. I wept for the Challenger.On this whole boycott thing....get over it. They can sell it how they want. If you personally don't like it.....DON'T BUY IT.
1,Death Proof = Babbling Bimbos,"This is hardly the work of genius. Just a really crappy movie, masquerading as camp. About half way through the movie, I found if I used a 10x Fast Forward speed, the movie was a lot more enjoyable. Worst movie dialogue, EVER. Quinton should publicly apologize for this horrible flick."
1,If you like Kurt Russell or car chases don't buy this DVD,"I bought ""Death Proof"" without prior knowledge of it, based solely on Kurt Russell being in it and a promised car chase.Kurt Russell was in it but I have to feel he has fallen on hard times to have taken this acting job. This was not close to the standard or quality of his other movies I've seen and enjoyed. If you liked Russell before don't buy this DVD.As to the car chase it was at best amateurish with scenes cutting out just before the car actually crashes, cars doing things that just can't be done (radiators can not withstand the beating given etc). Seems they don't feel this type of action is great without being impossible. Car action fans will be disappointed.There may be a segment of the public that will like this DVD but if you fall in the category of a Russell fan or a motorhead this is a waste of your money."
1,"Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)","I refuse to give in to another studio trying to ""milk it"" for all the money they can get. They must of took thier cue from the Sci-Fi Channel who are masters at Milking It or Rip You Off 2.5"
1,"I want the whole Grindhouse experience, not half.","In April of this year I went and saw a film, that turned out to be a powerful, artistic cinematic experience that was worth every penny of the twelve bucks I forked over for my ticket. Maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but that was how I felt when I walked out of the theater. I saw it again a few weeks later, and felt the exact same way that time too. The truth of the matter is, I want to relive the experience to my hearts content. I don't want to do half now and half later. I don't want to fumble around with discs and trying to flip forward through animated menus and all kinds of crap to relive it. I want the experience I had at the theater - both films and all the trailers on one DVD. I will not spend one cent on any of this stuff until the whole experience is available. To tell you the truth, I could give a rip about special features, I just want the complete package."
1,Redundant!!!,"This has got to be the most redundant waste of time of a movie ever. Most of the movie is a bunch of stupid woman spewing pseudo-intelligent dialogue that has to do with nothing! Not only that, but you can hear quenton tarantino speaking through every character. It's not original, not even for tarantino. It's utterly stupid. He easily turns Kurt Russell's character into a whiny turd by the end. Tarantino needs to leave!!!"
1,You need to be a girl to like this movie,"It's standard Tarantino over-the-top dialoguing, much of which is rehashed from ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". Except it's girls rolling these endless half-intricate half-deep talks that delve into their - yes - sex lives (mostly), work lives, drinking lives and.. *yawn* .. wow, if you are a girl and you want to hear girls talking like the guys did in the movies mentioned above, this is your movie for you.Kurt Russell, you definitely want him to bring some of his ""Snake Pliskin"" / ""The Thing"" ultra-gritty badass. You don't get that and I really don't feel like elaborating. You just can't turn back the clock. :(Early on, there's some neat film tricks blah blah.. scratchy record noise, B/W film.. it's just not all that good. I recommend you do not buy this film.HOWEVER! There is some cool music in this. And ~*~HOT~*~ girls."
4,ten minutes with eyes closed,"but other than that, its a cool film, even better music.i saw the integral version, so i won't be bitchin' about the mutilated DVD release in the states, but reviewing the film instead.2 stories, first is slightly better in terms of buildup and suspense, ends way way too bloodily for my taste. lapdance scene was great :D.second story a relief, damn, a happy end.. i didn't expect that and i was so happy when it happened..great film. not necessarily a movie theater thing, perfectly watchable on DVD. especially if you don't like seeing repeated scenes of a bloody car crashes.no, i didn't like that.."
1,not worth it without both...,"these movies were fun for the price of one but that's it. Death Proof is widely overrated. The car chases were nothing special and QT's flair for dialogue is dead. Rank profanity is not ""clever"" dialogue. Planet Terror was much better and even then was only a grade C zombie flick. for twenty bucks apiece they ain't worth it. esp Death Proof which consists of a bunch of chicks cursing and swearing and some car chases. yawn."
1,don't buy it. this movie serious rip off!!,"Trust me, I bet you won't like it. I already watch movie... this isn't great act and very boring!! Only talk too much and few act kill. Its really suck movie!! Don't buy it either rent it. Its wasting time for watch and nothing happen."
3,You were expecting Shakespeare??,"Tarentino created this movie as an homage to the old '70s exploitation films, including the bad editing and corny dialog. Some of these reviewers are lambasting the movie due to its lack of character development. Sheesh - its a Grindhouse movie, do you remember them. This film is an accurate copy of one of those films, so it works on that level."
2,Total bore,"I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. I have seen Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Dusk til Dawn, Jackie Brown and a few others. Loved them all. But, this film was FREAKING SLOW!! OMG, I was falling asleep in the first 30 minutes. And by the final car chase scene (WHICH WAS AWESOME). I was desperately wanting the get the hell out of the theater. WAY too much talking and not nearly enough action."
3,Nowhere near as good as it should be,"This is Tarantino's weakest film.A lot of this is taken up with pointless, meandering dialogue - way below his usual standard.Some of the action is incredibly well filmed, but overall this disappoints.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Don't waste your money/Could have been a good movie.....,"This movie is boring, far fetched, self serving, has a weak plot, was a waste of my money, has girls that are not as hot as he thinks in it and is just generally dissapointing. This movie could have been great if he made the girls hotter and actually had more than 3 minutes of action in the first hour and 1/2 of the film. Kurt Russell cry's for his mommy at the end and I wanted to do the same because this movie was so terrible. Don't buy or rent this movie, keep an eye out for it in your nieghbors trashcan and watch the last 15 minutes if you want to lose respect for Kurt Russell, then go rent Big Trouble in Little China and get it back again."
2,Not as Good as Expected,"I just finished watching it.I didn't like it.Very chick flickish, even for a supposedly horror movie.When I played it, the video (rental) said ""for sale only"", kinda funny.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Way to much dialogue, mostly female...Zzzzzzzzz..."
2,Basically a waste of time,"I liked the final chase, but otherwise this movie was incredibly pointless. It was long and almost entirely devoid of plot. Now, in the past Quintin and other directors like Guy Ritchie have taken movies with little actual content and made them memorable and interesting because of nifty dialogue, but this movie falls flat in that arena; there is plenty of dialogue between the real parts of the movie, but it's very forgettable and not interesting in the least. My guess is Quintin threw this script together in a single afternoon--two at the most. I cannot imagine ever watching this movie again and wish I'd not seen it once. It gets the two stars because of the scene at the end--which is merely fairly good and certainly not worth sitting through 90+ minutes of the rest of the movie."
2,SOMEBODY PLEASE SLAP TARANTINO !!!!!!!!!,"OK , ENOUGH !!!!!THIS GUY USED UP ALL THE PULP FICTION GENIUS TAGS ON HIS LAST TWO MOVIES THE HIGHLY OVER RATED KILL BILL AND THIS STINKFEST . SAVE YOUR MONEY . ITS NOT THAT ENTERTAINING AND TARANTINOS WITTY BANTER ISNT ALL THAT ENTERTAINING ( UNLESS ITS DELIVERED BY SAM JACKSON ) . THIS MOVIE TANKED FOR GOOD REASON .IT STINKS . SHORT ON THRILLS AND IDEAS . YOU'D BE BETTER OFF RENTING DIRTY MARY AND CRAZY LARRY OR VANISHING POINT . YOU SHOULD BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN QUENTIN STEALS MOST OF HIS IDEAS FROM OTHER FILMS AND GEEKS LIKE ME RUSH OUT TO SEE THEM . BUT REALLY FOLKS THIS IS A DUD AND MR T. HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS . WHO WILL HE RIP OFF NEXT ? WHO CARES..............."
1,Total Waste of TIME !!! 100% DUM & STUPID MOVIE!,"I can't wait to write a review about this movie! I watched ""Death Proof"" yesterday and I couldn't keep watching for longer than 20 minutes; I had to shut it up. Man! I've watched many bad movies before, but not like this one. So stupid dialogue pacing, idiotic characters, camera angle, editing, cinematography, acting, story telling, directing, everything is the worst I've ever seen.I didn't expect this kind of movie from Quentin Tarantino."
1,week,"greedy pigs. how on earth can they justify releasing terror planet and deathproof seperatly. the whole hype behind this film was the fact that it was a double feature. i guess QT or RR dont have enough money as it is. week dude, completley week. They obviously dont respect fans of their work."
1,grindhouse,i didn't think Tarantino could make a boring movies. At about 1 hour 20 mintues is got interesting for a few minutes. This sucked.
3,Wait for the double-feature--just like Masters of Horror,"Well, it looks like I will be waiting again for the ACTUAL realease of this ""double-feature"". The alleged reason these two films were released were to bring back the ""grindhouse"" feel and that includes not only a second feature, but the hilarious trailers. Release like this it's just another movie (and this one is not as good imho).It took a year, but I waited for the box set of Masters of Horror and wound up paying much less that those who had to have it right away. While I would wholeheartedly recommend this with its other feature I cannot say I would buy it on its own."
1,A Major Letdown,"I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. Tarantino is well known for his parodies of cheap exploitation films. I thought that Reservoir Dogs was good, Jackie Brown was very good, Pulp Fiction was excellent, and the two Kill Bills were a masterpiece. Death Proof looks like it was thrown together without much thought or intelligence. Worse, it is mean spirited. Death Proof is not a parody. It IS a cheap exploitation film.Tarantino films have great dialogue and humor and feature interesting characters. There is not a single character I could identify with in this film. If you want to see car crashes, go to a demolition derby."
1,Truly a boring piece of S#!T,"If you knew some one who had never seen a Quentin Tarantino film and you tried to help them to understand one by telling them about them, like mentioning how he writes a lot of dialog and there's a not so subtle foot fetish, the references to older films from the 70's and his own films, strong female roles, no CG, violence and language, and then they tried to make a Quentin Tarantino film based on what you told them. And it didn't work on ANY level. Yeah, that's how this film feel like. A sad parody a Quentin Tarantino film."
2,I hope Planet Terror is better. This one put me to sleep!,"Wish I had rented this rather than buy it, solely based on the hype and Tarantino reputation. I wanted everyone to die a horribly gruesome death by the time this snoozer ended. Alas, only smattering of satisfaction was to be had. QT should compensate those who wasted our money on this looser by giving us Planet Terror. I can only hope it's not the stinker this one turned out to be."
1,"Kind of like the Madonna reference in ""Reservoir Dogs""...","...in other words, a one note solo, and pointless.If you have a foot fetish, click the ""buy now"" button. Many shots of female feet stuck out of car windows. Sort of like the Bridget Fonda foot fetish riff from ""Jackie Brown"" and the Salma Hayek foot fetish riff from ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" multiplied tenfold. No shortage of feet in this film.After that, it's all senseless violence. ""Kill Bill"" with closeups of feet.The Rose McGowan sequence was particularly cynical, cruel, pointless and vulgar. Quentin, you're not a genius. You're a sick and twisted nerd on a studio budget.This is NOT ""Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction."" Deal with it."
1,Pulp fiction was great but this was horrible!,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen...No story at all and the girls in it talked about nothing just about the entire movie. If I had to guess, I would say that they talked about an hour and 40 minutes of the movie and then there were car crash's about a total of 15 minutes.... Thats pretty much sums up the entire movie... P.S there were way too many facial close ups.... At least they could have showed some titties out of all those girls they had but they didnt, that would have made me feel better about giving it one star at least."
2,"Good movie, bad company","I had already seen this movie, I just wanted my own copy. But it arrived with a blank generic Memorex DVD-R inside. I'll be lodging my complaint."
2,Too much aimless dialogue...,"This movie promised to be very good but fell short. The cars were cool and Kurt Russel is always worth watching, but the aimless dialogue sequences between the groups of female characters drug on forever! I had to fast forward until the scenes of Tarantino's idea of ""girl talk"" were over. Imagine two 15+ minute episodes of four females sitting around talking about crap before the movie begins again. If you will take note, Tarantino always has extensive scenes of dialogue between characters...it was ok in Pulp Fiction, but it is becoming quite annoying as his films progress and he sticks to this routine. Planet Terror was much better in this grindhouse double feature scenario...Tarantino should learn from Rodriguez!"
3,"Entertaining, A High Velocity Kinda Ride","Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" displays a great exploitation film.Kurt Russell stars as a psychotic, maniacal stunt driver. He enjoys high speed pursuits racking up terror, and delivering his sinister glares. The film is really simple in nature, entertaining enough to view a few times over. Slabbing the 'grindhouse' name in order to authenticate its manor may of hurt its success, but it really is a decent worthwhile film. Movies of this nature are becoming rarer, and many are often utter garbage. Always nice to see a decent one.Character development actually happens, and slow moments are only to further develop characters. The movie though relatively moves swiftly, maintaining the classic cars and chases as its focus. The film seems to come in two parts, my first time viewing it I had no idea of the first half. Overall it has been greeted with much air time on many movie channels, check it out. If you like what you see purchase it!"
3,Death Proof,"You know I wish that I could agree with most of you on this movie. But I was kinda dissappointed with it.I just thought there was too much dialogue at the beginning I was so ""bored"".There were only maybe four scenes that I liked from the whole movie and they were all close to the end. I just wish the guy in the movie done more killing, or had a little more action in it just something better than the way it is. It was still pretty good in those four scenes though.Well not everyone agrees with everyone about how they feel about movies. Everyone is different dont take just my word for it watch it and see for yourself you may like it better than me."
3,Overly-Tarentino-ized????,If you absolutely LOVE the way Tarentino uses dialogue to flesh out his films you will LOVE Death Proof. 80% of this movie is talking. And mindless drivel at that. When these groups of women babble on about nothing for what seems like 30 minutes it gets old quickly. Russell is great as Stuntman Mike. And the action sequences are excellent. The problem is getting to the action takes wading through untold minutes of crap.
2,meh,I was looking forward to this movie for a while and then...!it actually kind of sucked. It had great potential but it almost feels like Tarantino was all into it at first and then just got lazy halfway through filming and settled on apathy and mediocre story development. Showing the aftermath of the crazy carcrash would have been awesome! that accident was a saving grace for this movie--how jacked up is that?!
3,Not Snooze Proof,"As an avid fan of Tarantino's other movies I expected a lot more from this one. There are a couple of things which kill the movie, the first of which is that it didn't really need to be divided into two parts. The cast, scenery, dialog, and setup are all much better in the first half of the movie than in the second part. By letting the movie conclude with the first cast having thier revenge (yes, some re-writing) rather than breaking off and re-starting with a fresh cast it would have been a better movie, as well as a bit shorter. Instead, the movie is 30 minutes too long and there are no interesting people on the screen except for Rosario Dawson for most of that time. And there's a ton of dialog between two pretty dull actresses. Three stars is charitable; a great soundtrack helps."
3,Classic Tarantino... but thin,"""A guy walks into a bar, stalks some babes, and kills them with his muscle car""-- THE END. And that's about it. If you're a Quentin Tarantino fan like me, you'll appreciate that Tarantino style, such as the over-dialogue in the script, and the homage to 70's B movies ( the 'film' is filled with splices and poor editing-- that's brilliant!!) You can tell that Quentin had fun with this-- he puts HIMSELF on the screen-- that's how he does it.But I found myself waiting for something more, and then just kept waiting. Yeah it's got gore, yeah it's got muscle cars, and yeah it's got babes. So for that-- good job Q.T., but this ain't no Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill."
3,"A good film, ruined by greed","I loved Death Proof. I loved Grindhouse and walked out of the theater grinning from ear to ear.My issues are not with the film presented here. It's how it is presented. What made Grindhouse so awesome was the experience of seeing it in theaters as a double bill, with the fake ads and trailers and all that came with it. These DVDs of Death Proof and Planet Terror completely take the film out of the context it was meant to be seen.One final gripe: I don't think the ""missing reel"" should have been inserted onto this DVD. It was one of the best jokes in the whole film."
3,SHUT UP ALLREADY!,"OK I like Tarrentino movies but they are getting a little too similar.The dialog in the movie is totally pointless. Yes thanks Q for trying to give us a sense of who these girls are, so we care about them when you crash your car into them. But it seems so forced. I know you are doing it.I'm also getting tired of snuff flicks. What's the point besides desensatizing us. I think these directors want us to be ok with the idea of people being tortured and butchered.Anyways, when the movie FINALLY gets to the action it's pretty good. You may as well just go to those scenes. There is absolutely no point in the rest of the movie."
3,"What? This Could Have Been Great, It Wasn't.","I was so looking forward to seeing this. I waited months for it to come to DVD. It flopped in the theaters and I figured that it was too smart for a mainstream audience. After seeing the movie last night I realize I was wrong. It wasn't very good. It wasn't very good at all. There were about 15 minutes that were great but over all it was pretty bland. It was such a great idea and I thought that fun, cheezy, low-budge, violent, and sexy movies would be back. What happened to the B-movie? When did everyone get so serious? I thought with the internet there would be a huge influx of Grindhouse movies... but it flopped.It wasn't very good and there are a million missed chances."
2,Stuntman Mike!!!,"This movie just missed. The car chases, the concept and the casting were all very good. The only thing that got in the way was that babbling Daffy Duck of a director channeling his endless babble into the movie. It was just too much and too long and just babble babble babble. When they finally got down to the nitty gritty it was good.Daffy... er... Quentin?... SHUT THE HELL UP!ps Kurt Russell was great as Stuntman Mike!!!"
4,"Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Set!)","It is what it is...Campy, funny, terrorific, and pretty much worth the money...Just don't expect ""The Sound of Music"" here. It's entertaining gore, blood & guts, just the way we like it."
3,Like?,I wanted to watch this to get hyped up for Django. I was sufficiently hyped. Kurt Russel is a creeper.
5,IF you want a chick movie that your man can watch.......,This movie is the ultimate chick flick ladies grow a pair and let death proof into your heart..... it's quite liberating..... don't be scared
5,DeathProof,The movie is pure Quentin Tarantino.....dark and sensual. Until the climax of course. Delivery was speedy and the movie was in perfect shape. Smooth purchase!
2,"Little Less Conversation, Little More Action...","*** SPOILERS WITHIN ***In his previous outings, Quentin showed himself a master of interesting dialogue. Indeed, I think the opening scene ofReservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary)ranks as one of the best in recent film.But here, the dialogue just fell flat. The subjects didn't interest me and the people talking about them didn't interest me. All in all, it was 90 minutes of boring dialogue with a reasonably decent action sequence at the end. If you do go ahead and buy this, save yourself some time and skip right to the action. But if you watch it full through, don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Style over substance,"Other reviewers have said it best, this movie is ""style over substance"". What did I think of it personally? It was slow. The first half of the movie starts off OK and you are thinking you are going to really get somewhere. But then it drags and drags. The conversations are not witty filler here, they are all the movie has to offer and drawn out like they are they are no longer entertaining. We meet plenty of characters but most don't matter and honestly they are all disposable. The only saving grace in this film was Stuntman Mike himself, who was genuinely enjoyable. The other faces could come and go. The only action in the film is a couple of gruesome scenes 30 mins into it and then a car chase about an hour in. The ending leaves you going ""huh? that's it then?"".I'm a fan of the whole grindhouse experience but as a movie standing on its own merits there really isn't much to DeathProof."
4,Tarantino does it again,"Just watched the DVD. It's awesome! Loved the links to Kill Bill, great special effects, fab music as always, great dialogue. All Tarantino fans should check out this movie.I'm not that upset that they're not releasing the two movies together although would have loved to have seen the movie trailers."
1,Half a film is worth two in the bush...Not,"I saw GRINDHOUSE in the theatre. I'm not one of the fickled ADD movie going public. I am a fan of the genre. That said, I have to say that I'm truly disappointed that Tarrantino and Rodriguez backed down when releasing these the DVDs this way. It's a slap in the face to the people supported this thing from start to finish. If I'm given the choice to buy the movie in increments or not buy it all, I choose to remain 40 bucks richer."
1,Too Much Talk Destroyed This Film.,"QT got too wrapped up in his own ego for this trip. The first talk almost worked (but not quite). When the second ladies chat begins, the movie just dies. It goes flat and what follows does not save the picture. It even became silly and that did not save it either. Do not waste the money."
2,Interesting concept.,"I am a huge fan, but QT should stick to films that are not about dismembering young ladies for fun... everyone in the room (watching) got nauseous- it just really missed the mark for the people I know. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are among the best, so violence is fine... Planet Terror was a hit with the group. Deathproof quite easily was opposite in its effect and had moments and a general theme that was unhealthy and unnecessary for a man of talent (QT I mean)."
1,If Boredom Were a movie...,"This is not a slasher movie. If it was there would be about 2hrs less dialogue and triple the body count. There is absolutely no pathos to this movie either. What if fails to accomplish by sharing the joy of a psycho who likes killing with his car, it fails to turn over when the girls start chasing the psycho. The dialogue is much like watch a very shrivelled, ugly person masturbate for 113 minutes while the eye candy saves nothing. If you have a choice between talking to a vapid moron with no sense of reality and a vast case of apathy or watching this movie, shoot the moron, burn the movie go out and get a few beers. There is absolutely nothing about this movie worth recommeding except NOT WATCHING IT. If you do, at least fast forward and save yourself 45minutes of your life;)"
2,.........,"this is by far the worst Quentin Tarantino movie.This movie has no storie at all.Its just a car chasings cars, with 4 chiks talking about nothing and every thing.I heard it was the next Pulp Fiction....... i dont think so !"
5,"Original, funny and entertaining",Awesome awesome movie I loved it! Im ushually a chic flic kind of movie watcher and wasent sure if i would like it but Rose Mcgowan is my fave actress so I figured it was worth a shot. Im so glad I watched. It was compleatly entertaining and even though Rose dies withen the first half it was still a great movie.
4,Death Proof,"I'll be rather straight-forward, I like this much better than Planet Terror. I know I am in the minority, but I can only express my own feelings. On the visceral level, it was truly high impact. On the emotional level, the many characters are given smart, sassy and even thought provoking dialogue. Tarantino should be applauded for taking a chance on what he wanted to do. I will furthermore state; this is a better film than Kill Bill Vol.One."
4,Still excellent Tarantino work,"Too bad Tarantino (obviously) tried to balance serious work with parody.Didn't quite work. The movie is excellent when it takes itself seriously and very bad when it tries to be a 70's spoof.The characters are exceptionally well made and memorable. Three days after seeing the movie, I'm still constantly thinking about Stuntman Mike and the girls.At the same time, though, there are some very silly plot elements that simply break the rhythm of the movie rather than contributing to the feeling that you are watching a 70's piece.Btw, Rodriguez obviously did not have the balancing dilemma - Planet Terror is a plain awful and unoriginal zombie movie."
2,kinda boring - not much fun,"I like the old film style, but the movie is not as fun or interesting as it should be. too much talking, not enough plot development or action. I miss the old tarentino films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Everything since then has been lame. Kill bill sucked too."
1,"Wow, what a disappointment!","I love Tarantino, but this was awful. I found myself turning it off to go to the bathroom and kitchen. His usually quirky, interesting dialogue just wasn't there this time. And to top it off, the characters were incredibly annoying. Not a good mix. He already makes the current day equivalent of grindhouse movies. Now, when he tries to recreate those clunky films, he fails. He should've made the same movie in his usual style without trying to imitate the look or try to live in a different time. It's like doing an old musical and trying to make it the way they did then. It just can't work. You can recreate the look, but it has no heart, it's uninspired. It's like Scorsese's ""New York, New York,"" it was set in that time, but was a modern movie. Inspiration comes from the gut and Tarantino lives today, not then."
1,"Great movies, should be ONE DVD!!!!","I love these movies, the directors always put out brilliant work. However this is one dvd I will not buy. These movies were shown as ONE and should be released as ONE! I'll find another way to own them."
4,Great Taratino Film But not Many Extras,"I'll rate this for the film, not the fact that they havent release a verson they promised to release. The film's great alittle on the short side but great all around, I rather like this verson alot cause of the extra footage that wasnt on at the theater, great overall for diehard fans but letting you want more extras for others."
3,Not the way it should be...,"Having seen the entire Tarantino release that coupled Planet Terror with Death Proof, spliced together by some really good ""fake"" trailers, it is a shame that the studios are going for the dollars rather than releasing the Grindhouse Experience as a whole, on one single DVD. Rather than shelling out, say, an extra $5.00, the consumers are expected to shell out $40.00 for both pics. Due to this strategy, I believe I will pass on this purchase altogether."
3,Death proof,"Acting was below average, dialogue bad,sometimes really bad but this is the best thing from Tarantino, so that's a low bar. Anyway, at least it's far better better than the Rodriguez companion piece, tho"
4,Disinfect and Move On.,"There was only one issue I had with this product and that was the sticky gunk of hair that I had to take an alcohol pad and lysol to, stuck on the removable exterior cover. Other than that, both disks are in working condition and I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,WOW,This is the greatest Kurt Russel movie I have ever watched. I particularly love watching him get his ass kicked for being a total psychotic twisted dude.The dvd was good quality and I would purchase from this site again.
1,Only good in this flick was the KIWI,"After I saw this terrible movie, and it wasn't just me, I wanted half of My $$ back. I was disgusted. I was BORED. I was let down and led astray. buy the other one Planet Terror instead!!!!!!! How can they have a double disc."
3,not a great tarantino film,"I always watch tarantino's movies because when he's good he's great (pulp fiction, reservoir dogs) unfortunately this is just not one of his great movies. I was okay but not what I anticapated."
4,People are way too hard on this movie,"The only problem I had with this movie was that the first segment was too long. A lot of the dialog could have been cut out and get to the second set of girls more quickly. Because that's really where the action takes place. But once this movie gets going, it's a thrill!"
3,Xtended edition: Xtended chat,"I really liked the action scenes and effects,no doubt,but they talk and talk for hours non-sense,at least they should have included another action stunt to make it less boring,then i would have given it 4 stars."
2,SNORE...,"I wanted to like this movie. I enjoy 60s-70s Grindhouse. I like the idea of paying homeage to an overlooked genre. I REALLY like Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Ferlito. But I don't like Quentin Tarantino. The guy is a blowhard and the ability to write and direct a decent movie has obviously passed him by. This movie was so bad that I nodded off twice. The second time I fell asleep I actually spilled my soda all over my new silk boxer shorts and woke up really ticked off. Quentin you owe me $2.75 for my dry cleaning bill!!"
1,Tarantino's worst...,"It's hard to believe that this movie is directed by the same man who brought us greats such as Pulp Fiction. Stupid, shallow plot, superficial characters engaged in vulgar, juvenile conversation. This was not an intelligent script at all. Tarantino needs to stop hanging out with Eli Roth, and then maybe he could get back into his former groove."
1,No Trailers !!!! A Rip Off,"Well I am off the buy a Bootleg copy of the REAL Movie, the one I saw in the Theater ,you know the one that was a double feature with the trailers, Wasn't that the whole idea and what made this movie so much fun,F**k the Weinsteins those Greedy Pigs and shame on Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriguez who should know better, you won't be getting my money."
2,Tarantino's Weakest Effort by Far!!,"I just don't know what to say? I'm a HUGE QT fan and this movie was just plain bad! How could the same writer/director of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill be responsible for this mess? The dialouge was never ending and it was not unique, quirky, funny, or intriguing like it was in his previous works...it was just ANNOYING. Also I don't think it would have been possible for QT to write more unlikeable female characters in the second half of this film. I was rooting for them all to die! And sadly, they were SUPPOSSED to be the heroes. Also, what happened to Stuntman Mike at the end of the film? He just wussed out. Very weak all around.Although I will acknowledge that I enjoyed much of the first half of the film and the car chase scene. Hence 2 stars instead of 1."
1,a real stinker,This movie was so bad I walked out of it when it was in the theaters. The women sitting around and gabbing about nothing important to the movie for five min. was the final straw.
1,BORING!,"Couldn't get past the first 15 minutes of this film. The first scene was played out too long and did not hold any interest or dialog for anyone over the age of 13. Save your money, Buy another movie!"
2,"I'll buy ""Grindhouse"", but not this...","Like many others, I'd much rather have ""Grindhouse"" than seperate releases. When that film is released, I'm first in line to buy it."
5,DON'T BE SUCH GEEKS!,"Yes, Grindhouse was the coolest movie ever. And yes, I too wish both films were released as they were theatrically. But c'mon, people!! Everybody is complaining about the individual releases, saying that they are boycotting and are not going to buy these films separately, but in the same breath you all are saying how much you love this movie and how you couldn't wait to see it on DVD. Well... here it is! So, if you all really loved it, then buy it! If not, don't. But please, do SHUT UP!!"
2,Ripoff,"To buy this dvd is to miss what made this such a fun film in the theater. I hope that Planet Terror has better extras when it is released. The Machete and Thanksgiving trailers were highlights of the film and I thought part of it. Also, the film itself. Okay, but not nearly as good as Planet Terror. The final half of the film drones on and on with its chase scene. Also, the dialogue between the girls was not up to the par of some of Tarantino's former films (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill). So, save your money and hope that Grindhouse is released like it should be on one disc (and it would fit on one disc by the way). If you must buy one of these films, try Planet Terror."
1,Add More Chicks Talking,I sure hope this unrated cut has 45 more minutes of chicks sitting around talking because that would be awesome.
5,Penetrating and Original,"This was my first reading of Colette. What a poetic, beautiful, and amazing writer she was. In this novel, we meet a woman who is definitely revolutionary for her time and ours. Colette is aware of the sorrow and happiness that are intertwined in life. The main character's life follows a path that has much loneliness and doubt, but she, most importantly, has her will. This is truly a feminist classic. What I admire most is the courage to write such a work and to write it so well. The language is intoxicating."
5,Great product to replace worn out OEM,"I have a 1985 Toyota Corolla ""AE86"" and my OEM Headlight/Dimmer Switch was cracked on the shielding for the board. This is great for replacement for your AE86 or Chevy Nova or Tercel or 80's Celica"
3,Bought this for my mom,"She liked it but, unfortunately it was made of porclien which I did not know. Other than that it was what we were looking for."
4,Useful and exciting text even for physicist,"In the last two or three decades, we mathematical physicists, who study on Schroedinger operator and scattering theory, have been required to learn much about the frontier line of pure mathematics, especially about the functional analytic method of linear PDE. For the study on the classical treatment of PDE, many excellent books have already been published, e.g. Courant & Hilbert, Petrovsky. But for the modern and advanced tool of PDE, we can't find so many exciting texts, except this Egorov's one ! This compact text (about 200 pages) is much highly suggestive than I expected. Although this text contains only the ""Elements"", many great ideas should be found even by theoretical physicists. Part two of this text, which deals with equations with constant coefficients, is especially inspiring for me, and probably for you. I can't afford to wait to read the following series of this text."
4,True facts og Gangsters,"Its a four DVD set each go for 45 minutes,very interesting viewing.The fourth disc is about more later times in the 90's,if you're interesed in gangster stories buy it worth it..."
5,A must have for any gangster historian/fan.,"This DVD set has some great narration, onscreen speakers, video and photos of American gangster history from the 20s through the 80s. 45 minutes per DVD without commercials is fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire set."
2,SRV's biggest problem: genre,"Without a doubt, Stevie Ray was an incredible guitar player. However, his genre is so limiting that it's difficult to appreciate his talents fully. How long can you stand the same old blues chord progressions? Granted, ""Little Wing"" is incredible, but sadly, the same can't be said of most of his music."
2,over rated,"go ahead and attack my review, srv fans, but deep down you know it's the truth. srv was a better than average house band guitarist but the words ""genius"" and ""great"" do not apply. those can only be applied to the inventor of this style of music, the great genius jimi hendrix. listen for example to srv's version of ""little wing"" versus the original by jimi. srv copies jimi note for note, but so what? did he write it? does srv's ""little wing"" have the soul and inspiration of jimi's? no, of course not. many people can learn to copy jimi's style but no one can be taught to be an original like jimi was.put another way, without jimi, there never would have been a srv. but about all srv did was make a few more listeners aware of jimi.srv, you were a good guy a good guitarist, R.I.P.jimi, you were the best, R.I.P. too."
1,best album ever,stevie ray vaughan (although hes white) roxxxxxxxxbest musician since old school backstreet boys
5,great,"i am a big stevie ray vaughan fan i like him alot. this cd is great i listend to it at least 30 times and not tired of it. and stevie this one is for you. i picked this song out for a friend when she wanted a song for us (me and her) so i picked pride and joy. and she loved it so she listens to him now i listen to it, family loves it. heck he is the BOMB."
3,Good...but there is a better collection than this.,"SRV was the GREATEST guitar player of all time! And yes...I would say he was ALOT better than Hendrix or anybody else for that matter.But that's a whole different topic.Let's talk about this collection.The greatest hits on here are probally without a doubt his most known tunes.Every song on this album is top-notch fantastic.Including the only previously unreleased song on here,""Taxman"".Only problem with this collection,is there is just NOT enough on it.There should have been at least 18 tracks on here.Maybe with another unreleased track as well.I would recommend buying the ""Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble"" collection instead.It's got two discs with all of these hits on it,plus more.Only track that is not included on the ""Essential"" is ""Taxman"".But the other songs on there make up for it...believe me."
3,Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble CD,"A good CD, but not my favorite by Stevie Ray Vaughan. The price was right and I bought it."
3,Stevie Ray Vaughan - Ok For What It Is,"I picked this up a while back because I did not have much Stevie on CD. This is a decent single disc collection that captures all of his radio hits and a few choice album cuts. Since this album came out I believe there is a more comprehensive two disc compilation that has also been released. For what it is the album is ok, but at only around 50 minutes they could have fit quite a bit more on it. Before Stevie Ray I really had very little appreciation for the blues. Since then I have become a big fan and have gone on to discover many other blues masters. If you are looking for an introduction or just the hits, this album is worth getting, but for a more in depth look I would pick up his studio albums (he only released 4 during his short lifetime)."
5,he is the best,"this man played the blues like no other,and nor will be anoter like him.I wish I could play like he could and i wish i had his total song collection.my regards to his family and friends,wish i was one."
2,Only 47:41 minutes long,1 Taxman previously unreleased 3:342 Texas Flood 5:213 The House Is Rockin' 2:244 Pride and Joy 3:405 Tightrope 4:396 Little Wing 6:487 Crossfire 4:098 Change It 3:589 Cold Shot 4:0010 Couldn't Stand the Weather 4:4211 Life Without You 4:16
2,Lousy Selection & Order,"This had to be put together by someone with no SRV knowledge. One of the best guitarists ever and they start off with a Beatles cover (Taxman)? Then 3 of the next 6 from the newer In Step, a keyboard laden album. Those 4 tunes alone need to be at the back of the line (if in line at all). The list order leaves everything to be desired.Whoever put this thing together really missed the boat on the essence of SRV's style and soul. I would recommend getting any of the other SRV hits cds but not this one.The only reason I didn't give this album 1 star was because it is SRV."
2,Unimaginative compilation.,"The worst thing a publisher can do is put together a compilation that makes you think you've heard it all - fine - but unfortunately doesn't leave you wanting to hear more. This compilation doesn't really aim at the potential fan of his music, and instead aims a little lower, for the broad market. The result is not as satisfying as it should be, and worth skipping entirely (as are most compilations). Fortunately The Real Deal: Greatest Hits 2 makes up for it. Check it out instead for the best possible introduction to Stevie Ray Vaughan's music on one CD - it's excellent. Needless to say, if you then want to hear more, check out the original albums. Or, you could just start there instead."
5,SRV's music is not of mere mortals.,"And Greatest Hits proves my point. Only Jimi Hendrix could pluck a string like he did, but not even he could play the blues like SRV. Listen to the breakneck speed of Pride and Joy, or the slow blues jam of Texas Flood. The jam of Little Wing is pure genious, taking a bit from Lenny of his debut album.When it came to playing blues, through adversity as well,Stevie Ray Vaughan has achieved a level of immortality. If you call yourself a true blues/rock fan don't go without this CD in your collection. In fact if you're a true blues/rock fan you shouldn't be without SRV period, end of discussion. So I also reccomend for beginners The Real Deal; Greatest Hits 2, Texas Flood, and Blues at Sunrise. Experienced SRV fans should buy this anyway in order to complete their collection with the unreleased Taxman."
2,Not a complete retrospective,"I am a devoted Stevie Ray Vaughan fan, but I was disappointed with this CD. The CD had only 11 tracks and should (and could) have included many more. It contained most of his radio friendly songs, but missed some of his longer, more intimate works. I was much happier with SRV's Greatest Hits II, which was longer and a more complete retrospective of his career."
2,Routine roundup,"Okay, if you're starting a fan off, you'd want them to hear examples of Stevie's stunning guitar. Makes sense, right? That's the guy's claim to fame, after all. And yet they miss out on a few of his best solos. Where's Rivera Paradise? Where's Lenny? Where's Things (That) I Used to Do? Wheres Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love? Love Struck Baby? Testify? Wall of Denial? Let Me Love You Baby? Or, if you want a bit of acoustic SRV, how about Life By the Drop? If you're looking for just Stevie's best known songs, this does contain Texas Flood, Pride and Joy, Couldn't Stand the Weather, Cold Shot, Life Without You and the cover of Little Wing. But this was a blown opprotunity to present the definitive Stevie Ray Vaughan overview. Stick to Essential if you're a newcomer, since it contains most of this album plus most the above tracks."
4,"Not the best ""Greatest Hits"" album for SRV","Was a fan for many years of this man, and was extremely devastated upon his sudden death in the mid eighties. An artist such as SRV has many great songs as well as lesser-known gems. I like the songs on this album but the bad thing is that it is not remastered. For the money you cannot go wrong, but for a little more you can get a better compilation than this one, which came out in 1995. Groovy sounds and of course the Blues mystique is what you get here. Features hits like Taxman and one of my favorites in ""Couldn't stand the weather"". If you can pick up the 2002 release ""The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble"" then that is a better purchase in my opinion. Other great songs include ""Pride and Joy"" and the fun rocker ""The House is rockin"". The best thing for this artist would be to present fans with a boxed set that included all of the singles as well as some live performances. If you are new to SRV then this is not a bad place to start."
3,"Worth it for ""Little Wing"" alone","I found SRV with Double Trouble more enjoyable, but to elaborate on the heading: even though Jimi wrote the song, he evidently barely glimpsed its true potential, which SRV saw very clearly and brought to fruition, putting flesh on the skeleton. Every note is heavenly, and just right. Even his decision to drop the vocal was dead on. Jimi may have been an innovator but--at least in this song--for sheer virtuosity, judgement, and taste for beauty, Stevie is streaks ahead of him."
3,"Good, But Not Worthy of Stevie Ray Vaughn",It's a shame that such an excellent artist is so under-represented in this compilation.
2,A disappointment,"This book is lacking in critical details. For example, it has very little useful information on user creation and assigment of authorities and privileges - and what there is on the subject must be either ferreted out or inferred. It never comes out and directly tells you how to set up a user correctly, as one would hope from a book of this type. It has virtually no information about datatypes, either. It seems good on the outside, but once you get into and start searching for answers you wind up sorely disappointed. Too bad there aren't better books out there."
5,A must read for anyone using DB2 UDB,"Whether you are new to DB2 UDB or an expert, this book is for you. It works as both the perfect learning tool and an excellent reference book that should be on every DB2 UDB user's desk."
1,Worthless,"Very disappointed with the book, returned it within a week. Written in a rambling and scatter-brained manner, gives no clear details of database creation or errors regarding db2X commands. May be useful for advanced users but Oracle DBA's wanting a quick insight into DB2 database creation and administration, stay away. Goes into other aspects of DB2 very well, but pointless if you are not taught how to create/troubleshoot the damned database in the first place."
5,A must have book for each serious DBMS developer,This is greatest book about DBMS I've ever seen. It's a must have book even for college student.
5,Two-year-old is a fan!,"My godparents bought these for my two year old off his wishlist. I had read the reviews and was already a Plan Toys fan. These are by far the nicest blocks I've ever seen and have just made me a bigger Plan Toys fan!They are SO smooth, and exactly the right size for building ""big towers"" by my two-year-old!The number of blocks you get is good, too. I worried at first it was a small set, but my son thinks they are great! (And he does have other blocks that just sit in the toybox now!)I can't say enough good things!"
5,Great product,"Bought this for my grandson's second birthday and at first I was disappointed by the reaction by him. However long after the glitz of the other newer wiz bang toys were breaking/getting boring he can spend hours building his imaginary buildings, forts or whatever. This is a classic boys toy and will always remain so."
1,Poor clip design,"The plastic anchor that locks into the belt clip is in two parts:the anchor point that is attached to the leather case and the plastic piece that locks into the belt clip. These two piecessnap together. Unfortunately, they also snap apart every time thecase is bumped against anything - resulting in the PDA falling to the ground. I bought this case so that I wouldn't have to carry my PDA in my pocket. After watching in horror as it hit the ground a few times, it's back in my pocket."
4,"Veto Pro Pac XXL-F ""very nice""","The build quality of this tool bag is second to none; however, the size of the bag is a little smaller than I had hoped. If you have longer screwdrivers and pliers you will have to lay them down on the non-vertical loading side. Also, the bag could use more useful outside pockets."
4,Great Protection at Reasonable Price,"Monster MP PRO 1000 with Clean Power Stage 2, 2775 Joule Surge ProtectionFor the money, this is a very good product. I live in Florida, which has more more lightening strikes than ANYWHERE else in the world. It was pretty important to me to protect my vintage hand wired amp; also, since I am not a ""job creator"" but instead a blue collar worker-bee, I can't afford a $1000 - $3000 protection unit. (If I was jamming with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page I might could do that!) Anyway: This product has plug-ins for pedals, high wattage units, analog and digital ""filter"" receptacles and shows current draw as well. Not bad for $149.00 list (put in cart to see actual cost). Worth the $$$; if you are a working Joe and you gig or have serious equipment, this is for you."
5,Clean Power!,"I had issues with the electrical noise coming through into my bass amplifier and other musical equipment. This Monster MP Pro worked its magic! Another excellent product. This strip is quite large but for where I am using it, the size doesn't matter."
2,Pro Immigrant and One Sided,"This movie makes an attempt at showing a the plight of illegal immigrants but when you watch it you are only shown a glimpse of the trouble they cause. They cross through ranches, leaving litter, killing animals, provoking ranchers, causing crime and when they have trouble out there the US Taxpayer is expected to foot the bill. I get that these people are trying to find work (not in all instances) but you can't be overly sympathetic because they have a rotten deal - you have to respect the rights of US citizens. If this movie was going to be fair - they would have show a rancher and his family - show the fear, show the costs!!!"
4,Been wanting to see this movie.,"Dvd was in really good shape. Movie played great. I have been wanting to buy this movie for some time,"
4,15 Years Later Comes a Review 2009,"Welcome To The Future 2 is actually a pretty good compilation techno-house dance album released 15 years ago. Just by the title alone you weren't sure what type of music you were going to hear. Their claim was that the listener was going to experience SoundBASE three dimensional Stereo sound when the CD was played back on any home or auto stereo system.Most notable tracks include, Oxygen by Miracle which is an excellent cover-tune originally done by French Music Producer, Jean-Michel Jarre. Other memorable tracks are Rozalla's I Love Music (Fire Island Mix). To me this and East Beat Syndicate's Love Transmission are the two most danceable tracks that kicks up the speed by the middle of the CD. This is a must-have for Electronica/Dance music aficionado."
5,bugdeflector,very easy installation & the truck looks pretty! it takes about 5 min to install since you open the box
3,False Advertising,"The pictures in the page advertise that it's the special packaging, but all I got was the normal blu-ray case."
3,Wrong Packaging,"I thought I was getting a digibook version of Battle Royale, but instead it is just a standard Bluray Case. I already own the movies on import, what I really wanted was the packaging... so buyer beware: current production of this is just a standard case."
1,"Once again, packaging that scratches DVDs","The DVDs are housed in book style packaging (similar to the 'Friday the 13th Ultimate Collection). The discs are sandwiched between cardboard pages and are most likely going to be scratched, like mine were. I'm going to return mine and probably not buy another, just to avoid getting another scratched set of DVDs. I'm sure Anchor Bay will be getting a lot of returned sets with scratched DVDs. Anyone who had purchased the ""Friday the 13"" boxed set and had to return it because the DVDs were all scratched will know what I'm talking about. I would advise picking up the single disc release instead. I don't know why companies continue to release DVDs with this idiotic packaging format."
1,false advertising,"I thought I was getting the special packaged edition of the blue ray (as it was advertised), but all I got was the normal blu-ray case."
3,Comparison to hunger games,"I watched Battle Royale one and two. Battle Royale one was watchable and slightly boring. Battle Royale two was totally not watchable, totally unbelievable and definitely boring.Hunger games is a movie much superior to either one of these. Battle Royale two was the worst directed movie I have ever seen. Imagine, if you can, a battle scene where every child is taking out battle hardened commando veteran soldiers. Imagine also, if you can, the situation where every high action battle scene immediately stops, including all shooting and sound except for the voices of the child that was wounded and the people around that child. Then, as soon as the children are again ready to start shooting, all action immediately begins were left off. Battle Royale one was better but nowhere near the quality and spectacle of hunger games. (As a point of interest, I did not particularly like hunger games.)"
2,psuedo intellectual plot thinly veiling mindless violence.,"its not bad but not worth the hype. Take away the 'controversy' created primarily with the time of its release at a time when the world was still reeling from student on student violence and your left with a mediocre blood fest. Had this movie come out in 97 (long enough before columbine to be forgotten) it would have never made it outside Japan and their enthusiasts.Calling it the clockwork orange of the 21st century, i guess, is not too far off if you believe that clockwork orange was actually a masterpiece. If your looking for violence and like watching teenagers kill each-other than you may find this enjoyable. Personally, I would put this at the intellectual level of a Tarentino film, all of which look like they were written by 13 year-olds."
4,Before Hunger Games...,there was Battle Royale. But I did not know that at first. I'm a big Hunger Games fan and while reading reviews for the books I saw a lot of references to Battle Royale. I had the book on my wishlist to read in the future but then I was able to obtain this movie. I really liked it. Very violent though. It made Hunger Games look like Disney. The discs were nicely done and packaged well. Now to read the book so I can compare.
3,I expected so much more!,"I have read about how crazy Battle Royale is for years and I finally broke down and bought a copy. I wish they had not tried to make it into some sort of blood soaked opera. I was having problems with my theater system sound prior to buying this and when I started watching it... well I thought I was still having problems with my sound. I truly appreciate the innovation of Japanese filmakers, but I feel the concept was enough of a departure from the norm without trying to make the movie a throw back to a silent film. Still anyone that loves Japanese films, this is a must have and I was not turned off to the concept. I was just left wishing they tried to be a bit more traditional. Maybe then we would never have had the Hunger Games, because everyone would only think of Battle Royale!"
3,Cult Classic a bit Over-Hyped...,"...First of all, the premise is great and the film is somewhat before its time. Its failing is in the overall production. Imagine a not-so-good ""Hunger Games"" and you get the general idea. If I'm being over-critical, perhaps it was because the revues I read were overboard in their appraisal. However, if you like the same kind of early films that Quentin Tarantino is reported to have adored, this is definitely your kind of movie."
3,Great concept maligned by horrible script and acting,"The premise of this film series is indeed unique, and it has all the ingredients for brilliance. The intensity is weakened tremendously by melodrama and horrible acting. These teens are just poor actors spouting trite and cliched dialogue. The films are worth watching for the concept alone. The gore factor is surprisingly low by Japanese standards, and the gore effects are purely second rate. It doesn't look real, therefore the shock value is diminished. I so badly wanted this film to be a classic, but it fails on numerous levels.Concept = 5 starsExecution (no pun intended) = 1 starScript and acting = a very generous 2 starsIf Tarantino loves this film so much, he ought to consider remaking it. Would be an improvement for sure."
3,Love Christmas books of all kinds.,"I love all the Intrique books. Each has a wonderful, mysterious theme but adds romance to each one. The action shows the detailed criminal activity and how the characters overcome the adversity. I appreciate Amazon sending me books on my Kindle (received as gift but bought from Amazon)immediately. Thank you."
4,Great thriller!,"This is one of the very best thrillers produced for television i have ever seen! Its got a superb script, and an equally fine cast! Barbara Eden is, as always, fantastic, and underrated Stuart Whitman is very good here. Robert Vaughn is fine too. Well produced in every level, its better then most american cinema releases this year! (1972)"
4,Good Book,This was another good purchase for me. The seller took extra care in the shipping and packaging of this book (Thank you!). My husband and I started this new diet and this book is a great addition.
3,Fit Perfectly,"For a lightweight cover, this is pretty good. It fit my 1986 Dodge 600 covertible perfectly. I had to cut a hole for the antenna, that's it."
1,Made-up names,"In the passage describing the part played by Torpedo Squadron 84 the attack on the Yamato contains egregious errors in the names of 12 of the 14 pilots of VT-84. The only two that are correct are squadron skipper, Lt.Cdr. Chandler Swanson, and Lt.jg Richard Walsh. This leads me to question the validity of other portions of the account that may be made up. My name is Dewey Ray. An Owen Ray appears in Russell Spurr's account . I was one of the pilots on the attack. There was no Owen Ray in our squadron and the names of the other pilots on the attack are similarly mangled or completely ficticious."
4,A Good Moving Account of the Final Mission of the Yamato,"This was a very decent and well researched account of the final mission of the Japanese Battleship 'Yamato'. The story was told well and the author made good use of first hand accounts by the participants on both sides. The book shows that not all Japanese were fanatical in their desire to die for no good cause, a lot where soldiers/sailors doing their duty as they saw fit.The author presented some very interesting accounts of young Japanese sailors and of some young American pilots. It also offered a overview of the whole suicide campaign against Allied forces off Okinawa. This was a easy book to read and I came away feeling sorry for alot of the American & Japanese servicemen who gave their lives for the country. A good read!"
1,Don't waste your money!,This is a really horrible book.Please don't waste your money buying it.I am ready to make a bonfire using my copy or give it to some poor soul.
5,A Wake Up Call,"I read mostly historical fiction, political fiction and spy novels. This book satisfied all three, and was a bit scary in it's premise. I only wish that everyone in the country could read this riveting novel before the upcoming elections. Many of us take our freedom for granted, and some day may find ourselves without it. This book is a wake up call!"
5,Timely and Intriguing,"Kathleen writes an extremely timely and intriguing novel with ""The Plot."" Her scenario is not too farfetched to be real, especially with the current power hungry administration in Washington.She sets a realistic stage and any reader will quickly realize she has been to the locations she is writing about.I highly recommend this book for a cold winter night in front of a warm fireplace."
4,well thought out,I read this book and was captivated from beginning to end! I learned so much from the book!thanks for writting it!
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this desk online. The quality is so low. The drawers are supposed to hold hanging folders. However, the hangers are too far apart that you can't hang any standard folders. This is a crappy piece."
3,Bill Payer Desk,"Wasn't so easy to put together. When you tried to put screws in, it seemed the holes were too big and screw did not tighten.I probably wouldn't purchase something like this again."
1,PATHETIC,"This is absolutely the worst movie for Steve Martin and Charles Grodin. I bought it reading other reviews thinking Charles Grodin would be awesome, but to my surprise this is one of the worst movies ever made. You may smile at one point, but beyond that, not worth a penny. Watching a wall is more entertaining."
1,Shocked and disappointed,"I consider myself a Steve Martin fan. I love the movies L.A. Story and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. I have read Steve Martin's books and would highly recommend them. However, with the exception of ""The Jerk"", this movie collection is terrible. I enjoy watching The Jerk and think of it as a classic. As for the other two movies, I had to struggle to sit through them and I will not be watching them again."
4,Beautiful futon frame for the price,"After some difficulty putting this together, I now have a beautiful futon frame for much less than I'd have spent anywhere else. The company was very helpful when I did run into problems. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,"Fun, safe toys","My kitties seem to really enjoy many PetStages toys. The cats bat the toys around & toss them in the air. These toys are durable, safe, and engaging."
1,"Absolutely No Play Value, At Least for My Cat","I have no idea why toys like this don't amuse my beast, but I have any number of cute, adorable cat toys laying about untouched. I keep thinking maybe I've found the exception, but if one exists I haven't found it yet. She picked it up once, and that was it. Since she is apparently immune to catnip, I've finally concluded that anything filled with the weed won't work. I'm happy for those folks who say their cats love it, and don't understand why mine won't cooperate."
4,Pretty to look at and kitty likes it too,"My cat really likes these. Plus, they are really colourful and cute (okay, I know they are for the cat but since I have to look at them on the floor it's nice that I like the way they look too!)"
5,An excellent DVD - useful with teens,"This DVD was a huge hit with my teen faith formation class. I did skip the first chapter (it tells the story that the movie is about to tell) and the song at the end is little hokey-sounding to teens, but otherwise the movie went over really well. The teens liked the use of actual letters and interviews and were very interested in the scenes from the canonization. This was much better than most Catholic DVDs we have used and really made the kids think about how we are all called to be saints."
3,Great story of a modern saint,"It's a great story but hard to follow. The Italian has to be translated but often is written in English and then it flashes away and goes to the next wording before I could read it all. It is a poor job of editing, I feel"
1,Love and Choice,"This movie was not what was expected. It did not last as long as the minutes state. It was a loss of money, it may be worth $3 if even that amount."
5,Get this one along with The AmericanEP!!!,"This CD single is the Australian import version of the 'Come With Us/The Test' single. This single contains three tracks which I really dig. The radio edit version of ""Come With Us"", the edit version of ""The Test"" is slightly different from the version as heard in the video for ""The Test"". The Fatboy Slim remix of ""Come With US"" is awesome and I totally dig it. However, I'm a little disappointed that the US 12"" single ommitted ""Come With Us (Edit)"" and ""The Test (Edit)"" from this import CD single. The B-side called ""HIA"" and the H-Foundation remix of ""Come With Us"" from the 12"" is ommitted from this CD single. The 12"" single for 'Come With Us' can be difficult to find. However, some of the songs from the 12"" single are now available on 'The AmericanEP'. The edits of the singles were still ommitted from 'The AmericanEP'. Get this import CD single while you still can and 'The AmericanEP' together and you will not be diappointed!"
4,"Get the 12"" vinyl","The Fatboy Slim Remix is the gem here. Edits are annoying. I thought about a 3 star rating but the strength of the afore mentioned remix makes it worthwhile for serious fans of both the Chems and Mr. Cook.I picked up the 12"" single as well. For the vinyl savy there are two gems; the Fatboy Slim remix and a non-album track called ""H.I.A."".Hurray for vinyl."
4,Come With Us/ The Test,"This here is a wonderful piece of work, The Test is a song featuring Richard Ashcroft. And Come With Us is the opening track to the new album from the Chemical Brothers ""Come With Us"" I don't really apreciate the fact that there is a radio edit of this song, because the album version is great from the introduction saying that the Chemical Brothers are back, to the end stretch that runs into track two ""It Began In Afrika"" which is the first single from the new album. The remix actually put me off this single for a while but still has its good and bad bits. Overall a good single and its good to see that the best D.J's Fatboy Slim & The Chemical Brothers are doing a thing together. I recommend this album to the full.Signing Off Now,Brad Cummins"
5,Nice product,Very enjoyble for all ages. Interactive characters make it feel more like you are playing against another player and not the computer. Nice variety of games on one disk. Not super high tech but it's refreshing to see traditional games put into a easy to play computer format. A+ to the designers for not overcomplicating a good thing.
4,Monarchs of the Nile,"As someone starting in Egyptology, this book helped to give basic info on the Pharaohs. It wouldn't stand alone but is a good start."
4,"Not as good as ""Annie""",But a worthwhile read. The harassment the girls experience because of their suspected relationship is realistic and heartbreaking. The bravery required to come out is heartening. This is a fine novel for both gay and straight teens to read to gain better understanding of the difficulties of being gay in America. We need more books like this!
4,A good book,"I think that Nancy Garden has done it again. Though this book is not as good as Annie On My Mind, I think that the two books have alot of the same qualities. ""Good Moon Rising"" is about two young women who fall in love while they are rehearsing a school play, realize they are gay, and resist a homophobia campaign against them. Jan and Kerry are the two young women, they don't care about each other that much at first. Kerry gets the part Jan wanted; But Jan soon warms up to her when she is still apart of the play. They soon discover they are falling in love and dealing with the fact that they are gay, not an easy thing for the two teens. Then the homophobia campaign against them begins. They deal with this as best as they can; If you want to know if they make it to the end still together I recommend that you read the book."
1,very poor quality,1)wig did not fit an adult male head2)there were no sideburns as pictured3)the hair was falling out of the wig4)I was charged a 20% re-stocking fee for something that SHOULD NOT be restocked
1,Lack of information,"I was very disappointed when this product arrived. When I purchased the item, there was no indication that the Blu-ray disk was zone B and would not work on my player. I have been trying to get ahold of this movie for more than twenty years, and now that I have it, I can't watch it... This is regretable, hands down, it is the funniest movie that I have ever seen."
1,Inaccurate research of the Crusades,Former Muslims Look at the Crusades and try to tell their story.No such thing as Christian Jihad only Christian defence from Islamic aggression.We all now that Crusades have been reaction on Muslims killingsof many Christian pilgrims and aggression motivated by ambition for land in 11th century.Let's not forget that Spain had already been swept over by Islamic aggression by the time of the First Crusade..
1,"""the horror, the horror""","As an active medievalist conversant with the complex factors which led to and fostered the crusader movement, I can say, categorically, that this book is awash in errors on an epic scale. While it may appeal to a certian segment of the Christian world looking for self-affirmation, it wildly distorts the actual cultural, political, religious, and economic forces at work during the Middle Ages and from which modern society emerged.Solutions to real problems will not be found by the embrace of ignorance and the propogation of old lies."
3,Historical Truth,"Well, historical truth would be nice for a change.I am sick and tired of hearing anti-christian bigots site the crusades as the moral equivalent of a Muslim Jihad.The truth is that the crusdaes were a ""reaction"" to militant Islam and not wars of conquest. Their stated goal was to recapture the holy lands for Christendom. Lands that were Christian for hundreds of years until they were taken by force by Islamic armies.Did bad things happen? Duh - its a war...But lets not say these were wars of conquest - they were actually wars of liberation that unfortunately (as we all can see in today's headlines) were unsuccessful. We are all paying the price...On balance is a good book."
1,Paranormal Activity?,"After watching this video i still am not impressed with this, like my earlier review of the Haunted Cemetery, I think this is bogus. I do like the moving rocker because i cannot see the wire pulling it but for a house with no power how can the exterior motion lights work? And why are there so many lamps in the house? And where did the light come from showing the supposed shadow in the window? Sorry, not impressed."
5,Best one yet!,"I agree with other reviewers, the rocking chair was one of the best events of the investigation.I thought the whole investigation was great: the lighting storm, the power outage, the equipment used, the evidence caught! I was on the edge the entire video."
1,I paid $1.99 for this?!,"It sucked. Half of it isn't even in focus, mindless, repetative chit chat from the ""investigators"". Definitely not worth the time or money. I've seen better."
2,Tech info,"The Technical info. fails to tell me if this is the 8 cell version, or the weaker 6 cell. Also, the info. says 4000mAh - not 4400mAh. I won't buy it without accurate and complete info."
2,Questionable,"I bought this battery for my nc6000. It functioned splendidly for about four months and then one day simply stopped working (I suspected the charge controller). I e-mailed the vendor (Northparts) and was told that if I would send in the battery for an RMA I would receive a working replacement. I sent in the battery the next day. After two weeks I had neither heard nor seen anything about a replacement, so I contacted them. No response. I kept e-mailing for another few months and heard nothing. After a few months of this they closed their Amazon shop. I checked their website, and they still existed, selling this part, but I could not find an address or a phone number at which to contact them.Long story short, the battery worked fine for a few months and then died. Not what I'd expect from the $50 I paid for the battery."
3,okay is about the best I can say,"It does NOT live up to it's stated battery length time. It does NOT fit snugly in the computer, if you move the computer it disconnects power but the battery does not fall out you lose power. So be careful and make sure if you purchase this replacement battery that you save everything you're working on before you move your computer."
3,HP battery,"The battery charges o.k., but doesn't stay charged more than an hoour without being recharged. We wish that it would last a little longer."
2,Corsair Aces of World War 2,"Unfortunately, I feel that this volume of this outstanding series is by far the weakest of the set. As of this writing, I own and have read all 37 published volumes, so I have a lot to compare it too. The book focuses mainly on 'I was there' first-hand accounts of flying the Corsair instead of the history of the aircraft and aces that flew it. This is OK, but I was expecting more of an aces/pilots/units approach that is the mainstay of the other books in this series. Often, first-hand accounts are just that, sort of a 'this is what happened to me', while overlooking the big picture. The artwork, as usual, is the saving grace of the book. The color profiles are outstanding as always. I would recommend purchase of this volume to ensure a complete set, but couldn't really recommend it to a military aviation historian."
5,Another winner!,"Once I watched volume one of this series, I knew I had to have volume two. Within a few days of practice (the tape comes with an accompanying booklet of music & tablature), I was able to play through these with expanding ease. Mr. Ruskin first shows you the basics of each tune and then breaks it down and shows you how to include variations. I've already played a few for some guitarist friends and they all sat up and watched. With a little more practice, I'll be able to play them a lot better. Very easy to view split-screen and on screen counter for reference. A winner!"
1,Missing parts,"This printer arrived with no POWER CORD, I would not deal with this person again. This printer is dated and I am finding it impossible to find the correct cord and have contacted HP and they no longer make it, so thanks so much for nothing."
3,"Nothing special, but ok way to spend some time","Written and set in a time that saw women with less options in the world than they eventually attained, and when the ""N"" word was freely used to describe ""the natives,"" this was an okay story, bolstered by being set in a locale not often written about, which helped keep this reader's interest. The writing was easy and the plot not too taxing. I read a mapback version which included the layout of the jungle outpost the killings take place in, which helped a bit."
3,FIRST BACK SUPPORTER I'VE TRIED FOR A DEVELOPING BAD BACK,"I am in my early 40's and have been having new and growing back pains. Tried this back support because it was on sale and my back was hurting.It's fine, I guess. But it doesn't seem to provide much benefit. I know it's for lifting, for which it doesn't seem to provide any assistance either way.For back support, it helps to keep my posture correct ... a bit .... and better posture does provides a little back relief from that affect alone when I use the belt.THE ONLY THING I DON'T GET is the shoulder straps. Maybe it's my body, but there is no risk, chance or possibility of this type of belt slipping or falling down (which I assume is why there are shoulder straps) and in fact, it only and does constantly ride UP from my proper positioning with movement and use.All in all, Decent Quality and if this is they type of back support you need, I would recommend it."
1,Doesn't capture the series at all,I was a big fan of the Reds in the 70's. This DVD is a major disappointment. It is full of too close shots of players swinging the bat and Joe G. telling you what happened - you don't actually see it. Most of the game shots are of a player running or swinging the bat. Very few actual plays are shown. Most home runs are shown with a close-up of a player swinging and then a cut to the outfielder looking over the wall. It almost felt like they didn't have the real game action and were cutting the story together from clips they had. All in all it doesn't capture any of the excitement of the 75 series. One of the best ever. 76 is much of the same.
5,One nation under Fishbone's Nutt,"I can't believe i slept on this album for so long. I had heard some tunes off of it when it first came out but for some crazy reason i never purchased it until recently. The album is great and Fishbone shows no signs of slowing down. Highly energetic and as always pure fun. Can't wait for the next one to come out this year and with Dirty Walt back I don't doubt that it will be a nutter classic from this highly underated and extremely talented group of characters. Can't wait to see them live again, always a great show. I don't think there is a band out there right now who can touch a live Fishbone show. Pure fun.P.S.I will never sleep on another Fishbone album again. I swear on my Nuttmeg. HA!!!!"
4,really funny crazy,Fishbone is good group and their sound is really original. This album contains a lot of good songs
4,"A valueable, interesting research tool!","I have just finished reading Culleton's Names and Naming, and I found it to be both a valueable and interesting research tool. I can't wait to incorporate it into my Lit. classes!!"
1,Not worth the read,"Factual but dry, I found the book as exhilarating as reading the dictionary. As a long time Joyce fan, I did not appreciate the mundane, trivial nature of the work. Thumbs down big time."
1,Dissatisfied,I'm a secondary level English teacher and wanted to incorporate Irish writers into my class discussion. I did not find this book to be suitable for teaching Joyce because it was vague and inaccessible for readers.
4,Great Singer,I first listened to Diana Anaid's Why should I on Yahoo Music. I had to go out and look for her CD. She is a great singer with Songs like Beautiful Obscene which is a song one can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it.
4,Adventure from Long Ago,"I read the Classics Illustrated ""comic book"" edition of this book when I was a kid. I remember them as soft-cover comics-type books, not hardcovers as this one claims to be. They were full-color books with panels of illustrations that helped tell the story. There was also narration and dialogue, just as in most comics. I remember that ""Robinson Crusoe"" was one of the titles I read over and over because I was attracted to the story of being marooned on a supposedly-uninhabited island. When I was in college I read the Defoe original, and I think I enjoyed Defoe's story more because I already had the illustrated version in my head."
3,"OK, but heavy","Very stable. Very heavy. Very large. I knew it would be this way when purchased, but needed stability. Have purchased a lighter version of another tripod for easier mobility. Use it on sites that require no motion/wind action. If you take lots of pictures on various sites take this one if you are not sure about conditions."
4,good book,I bought the amazon copy because there was not a copy of this book in itunes. I found it after I purchased it in the itunes store.
4,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book. For those who are fighting bad habits like procrastination, disorganization, poor time management, etc., this book is one of the best you can read. It shows how to achieve discipline, courage, endurance, and the other things which lead to a successful and contented life. It gives a strong Christian viewpoint but it does not push a political viewpoint, which is very refreshing. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone seeking to manage any aspect of his/her life more effectively."
2,still alive,"While we examine the whys and hows of the american internment of Japanese americans.The one item that stands out is NOT one died because of it,Where 40% of captive allied prisoners were starved and beaten to death. Captives of americans in German hands were one percent."
4,Easy on the senses,"I bought the CD and DVD together. I watched the movie first and then listened to the CD. The CD is far better than the background music in the movie. The pieces are played in their entirety, unlike the movie.I've only had the CD for a short while and have listened to it at least five times. The music is beautiful. One of my favourites is 'Written in the Stars' which from first hearing spoke to my heart. It's followed by 'Some Enchanted Evening' which fitted superbly into the mood already set.I'm a Rachel Portman fan and from time-to-time I hear a similarity to the music from Chocolat which I also have and love.This is a gentle and moving selection of music and one I know I will be listening to over and over again."
3,Needs more than just a score,"Yes, the movie had a great score, and when you hear it on CD, it takes you back to when you watched the film. However, I found the music by Italian singer Eros Ramazotti to be unfortunately omitted from the soundtrack. I believe he had 2 or 3 songs in the film. If anyone knows the names of these songs, please let me know."
3,UMMMMM broken,"When I got these shelves one was broken. Me and my wife decided that it wasn't worth sending back, and just welded the brackets back on, but ruined the paint when I did.3 stars cause thats what I have come to expect from buying the cheapest stuff I can find."
1,Never again...,"I have tried the AOL's cd that gives free connection for 3 months, and when I wanted to cancel the subscription (because I changed my home address) it was impossible to stop the bank tranfers. As incredible as this may sound, AOL claims that they cannot cancel my subscription because I don't remember my password. Even when I am able to confirm all other information (credit card number, date of birth, social, etc), they refuse the cancel the subscription.When I talked to my bank, the bank clerk told me that many people have had the same problems with AOL. I have met dozens of people in my University that faced very similar problems with AOL.AOL has a very bad approach to business and found a easy and certain way of losing customers."
2,Tibetan's Cordyseps triple extract for sale,"Our family manufacture Tibetan Cordyseps extract and is looking for distributor outside Taiwan. Aids Lung & Kidney Function, Strenghtening immune system,Aids Cardiovascular Health, etc"
2,A CD Of All Remakes!!!,"I bought this CD for the song It's Too Late. Had I realized that the whole CD was all remakes I wouldn't have purchased it. Most of the arrangements are disappointing and not even as good as the originals. Although, I like a lot of Gloria's music this CD will be taken to the used CD shop my next trip. Don't waste your money on this one!!!"
2,This album was a disappointment,"Gloria takes some classic songs from the 60's and 70's and sings them her own way. Bah! For the most part, most of those songs were better as originally song. I think I only enjoyed 2 or 3 songs on this disc."
5,What a surprise CD !,"I purchased this CD on a whim, and what a wonderful surprise! I knew anything from Gloria would be good, but I cannot even decide on a favorite song here! So many times, covered songs are so-so, not here, though. Gloria's beautiful range and wonderful accent will steal your heart. If it's possible to wear out a CD, this will be the one!"
3,Not quite...,"I hate to disagree with Mr. Tammaro, but this does NOT contain the first two Amboy Dukes albums: it's their first album plus a previously unreleased song tacked on at the end. Also, of their three Mainstream releases, this is by far the weakest. If you want to hear some great Amboy Dukes music, get ""Journey..."" or ""Migration"" or the flawed but still very good ""Loaded for Bear"" best-of anthology."
5,Very Enjoyable!,"I thoroughly enjoy this DVD. It goes without saying that Guy's voice, and the Gaither Vocal Band clips, are fantastic. But even moreso on this DVD I enjoy the interviews with Guy, who takes Bill Gaither on a tour of Guy's farm. I was thrilled to see Guy talking to and feeding his cows, watching Guy's dog guiding the truck down the road, seeing Guy's barn and tractor, and hearing his boys sing in the kitchen. The interviews with Guy are also priceless, as we get to hear him talk about his Dad and family. I really think he is a special guy and this is a great DVD."
2,"Just ""eh""","I'm a huge Lynch fan, so I got this CD. But there's not really anything about it that makes me want to give it repeat listens."
3,They should've stayed a punk band,"Nonetheless, I'm impressed. At times it lacks energy, but the guitar grinds al the way through. Seven Days is an intense song. Otherwise, just another rock album that you'll eventually get bored of. This one isn't worth the space it takes up in my CD holder"
4,GIVE THIS A CHANCE...,"wowyears ago,c.o.c where ""my"" band back in their hardcore punk days.when they ""sold-out"" & went metal,i totally tuned out without even hearing where their sound was going.boy,did i ever make a mistake....this is fantastic stuff!as many other reviewers have pointed out,this is along the southern fried black sabbath riff-a-thon.songs are well written,musicianship solid.wish i had given this a chance 11 years ago!"
4,Corrosion Redefined,"Adding guitarist/vocalist Pepper Keenan was the smartest thing C.O.C. could have done. Stepping in as the band's main songwriter on Deliverance, Keenan brings Sabbath crunch and Skynyrd boogie to their already heavy pallet. If you like straight up rock and haven't heard the bong hit groove of ""Albatross"" or the Thin Lizzy harmonies of ""Clean My Wounds,"" you don't know what you're missing. ""Senor Limpio,"" about the life of a drug lord, is Sabbath meets ZZ Top. Lead guitarist Woody Weatherman does a convincing impersonation of Tony Iommi and bassist Mike Dean takes the spotlight on the intro of ""Pearls Before Swine,"" as the band expands on its influences with some serious muslce and fury. Real rock fans rejoice!"
1,At your own risk,"These guys were one of the greatest punk bands and now. I'm disappointed. They should change their name. The first 3 albums were great. Now I couldn't tell you what they sound like. If you like punk stick with Eye for an Eye, Animosity, Technocracy, and six songs by mike."
3,Dropped crossover.,"With blind COC took a step away from their Crossover thrash/hardcore sound. Lyrically it stayed with typical hardcore lyrics, though. On this the music comes off as a little more listener friendly. Picture Pantera meets Soundgarden. Is it a bad thing, though? Maybe not. This album is fairly decent, for what it is. If you like Sabbathy metal, it would be for you. But a completely different sound from D.R.I. meets Black Flag hardcore on Animosity and Eye For An Eye.Also, to whoever said it, COC were never a deth metal. Shows what you know."
5,BUENISIMO,"QUE MAS PUEDO DECIR DE CERATI, APARTE DE SER UN FAN INCONDICIONAL , ESTE DVD ES SIMPLEMENTE ESTUPENDO ,, CERAS MUESTRA SU CALIDAD MUSICAL LO QUE LE HA COLOCADO EN UN LUGAR PREVILEGIADO , UN MAESTRE DE LA MUSICA,"
5,Los Temerarios son los mas shidos,Los Temerarios son los mejores aparte de los Tucanes De Tijuana. Yo creo que si esos dos grupos gravarian un cd o casset se venderia muy vien.La rason que digo esto es que los Tucanes Y los Temerarios son los grupos que estan pegando mucho.
4,Light reading,You can never be too young for this one. I actually found myself reading it twice. I seldom do that to a book. Good LIGHT reading.
3,Interesting,I enjoyed reading this short story. I has an interesting way of presenting theology. I would say this is a good book for maybe a preteen. Fun read although not much depth.
5,Follow,"Good analogy of following Christ. Makes you think about traditions verses scripture, and traditions can trap you from being free to follow where Christ leads."
2,Dark Horse,"This world is filled with false messages. We have been warned of this for centuries. The most tempting one is the voice in our own head that tells us what we should look like and strive to be. Using the long held tradition of making a point relevant to humans through the use of animals, the author tells the story of a group of horses held captive by the desire to be what they almost are, but not quite. Then, they escape and go on a journey of discovery, following a myth to the light. Freedom is close, but only if they can overcome the deception.** By its size, you might be tempted to dismiss this book as one for children, but the point it has to make is one that can be more fully appreciated by someone older. Yet, the lesson can not be learned too young. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"
3,Not what I expected,I was looking for a replacement bulb that actually produced a true orange light. This bulb shines far more amber than orange.
