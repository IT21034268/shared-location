2,Soapbox,"I found this book to be a real letdown. After reading The Physician and Shaman I was really excited to read Matter of Choice, but felt as though Mr. Gordon was just ranting on and on about liberal politics that didn't go along with the rest of set.I thought it rather interesting that Dr Cole didn't like performing abortions but did it anyway.She also had a problem with hunting and killing animals and ate it anyway."
2,Feeling Very Disappointed........,"With disappointment, I finished reading Matters of Choice. Gordon's third in his triology of the Cole family, definitely is not in the same league as The Physician and Shaman. As happens to so many modern-day novels today, the depth of the plot and characters were lost in the publisher's dumbing down of number of words.I grew tired of reading R.J.'s reasons to justify to herself why she performed abortions. Where was the Cole dynasty of trying to save lives instead of taking life? Even Sarah's death could not convince her of the truth. Why weren't alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, discussed by the characters? The reports of attacks on abortion clinics was like a broken record, as well as using the label anti-abortion instead of pro-life.Matters seemed more like a political statement to me than the grand, historical fiction I had come to expect from Gordon."
3,Less than satisfying,"After being thoroughly absorbed by the first two books of this trilogy (The Physician, Shaman), Matters of Choice felt rather flat. Maybe the contemporary setting drained some of the magic out. At any rate, the story seemed cobbled together, and often the book felt like a vehicle for expression of the author's social views, especially on the subject of our inadequate system of medical care. Good points to be sure, despite the 16 or so years the book has been out, but it doesn't make for enthralling reading. And the one big heartbreaking twist in the plot had me asking, ""Was that really necessary?"" I'd check out some of Gordon's other books instead."
3,Matter of Choice,"I read ""Matter of Choice"" the third book of an ongoing family saga after reading the first two in the series. I really enjoyed the first two books, but this one was just okay, nothing more. I was disappointed, and the way it ended there is likely to be a fourth book. I highly recommend the first two ""Physician"" and ""Shaman"" but I am not sure if I would read the fourth if it is like the third."
3,The Last of the Coles,"I was somewhat disappointed in this third Dr. Cole. It apparently was written to finish up the story, but it was not as well written or as enjoyable to read."
5,Superb light comedy from the late 40s!,"This is a delightful light comedy from the late 40s that I used to see occasionally on the late show in the 60s. It has virtually dropped out of sight in recent decades, so chances are you have not seen it. The young Louis Jourdan is great as a neurotic artist who causes some jealous friction with Lili Palmer's husband, Dana Andrews. But this film has gone the way of other great films, which used to see air-time, such as another Lili Palmer film, ""The Four Poster"" with Rex Harrison. It is really horrible when I discuss films like this and other people not only have never heard of them, but don't even know the actors in them!"
3,Prince's Sophomore Set,"Prince showed a nice progression from his debut album to this second effort. The overall songwriter is stronger, the music tighter and Prince's singing is more confident. ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" was his first hit (reaching number 11) and is a sexy, funky song. Others like ""Why You Want To Treat Me So Bad?"", ""Sexy Dancer"" and ""Bambi"" are excellent songs. His original version of ""I Feel For You"" is quite different than Chaka Khan's, it's a slower ballad in this version. despite the tremendous growth, Prince was still more confident in the more upbeat songs as a couple of ballads fail. Still, the album moved Prince a few more rungs up the ladder toward greatness."
3,Lost a little value,"It's been over a year since I last reviewed this album. Since we can only give whole stars, it gets three, but I actually give the album a 2.7. Yes, it does have the excellent ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" and my ""personal"" number hit ""Sexy Dancer"", but after side one is over there isn't much left (except for ""I Feel For You""). It's still a great album to purchase, but that's it."
4,Rare precious and beautiful,"This is an album that I think often gets overlooked, it's not pure funk, If I'm not mistaken, it has only one song that regularly gets played, and by the way sir, if you're reading this,you could include it in a set list; those of us who love you would love it! Okay back to the album, I Want to Be your Lover IS NOT the only good one. The original I feel for you is good , under rated. Still Waiting a beautiful ballad it shows where he was headed before he got there! I think those of us who've been listening to him for a long time, will surely see the gold in this one."
3,Some Good Stuff,"This album is definitely not one of the top Prince albums, but has some pretty good music. The best songs are ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"", and ""Bambi"". Of course, ""I Feel For You"" would become much better known for it's cover by Chaka Khan, but this version is nice too. While it is a step up from his debut, I still perfer ""For You"" over this. What don't I like? The cover! It's too tacky, especially that writing."
2,"Okay, WHY did they emphasize Rod's ""Self-Parody"" Period?","The only reasonable song here is Maggie May. Rod made some good stuff back in The Day, but you wouldn't hear much of it here. Where's... oh, I don't know... Gasoline Alley? Hm... what about Handbags and Gladrags? You Wear it Well? Every Picture Tells a Story? Mandolin Wind? Twistin' the Night Away? I'm Losing You? True Blue? That's All Right? It's All Over Now? And why, in their place, are Rod's self-parody hits such as Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? (I puke when I hear that song), You're In My Heart, The First Cut is the Deepest, and Tonight's the Night? SENSE IS NOT BEING MADE HERE, PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!"
2,Hardly worth the one song I like,"Actually, I've never really cared much for Rod Stewart's songs, save for a few late-80s cuts (""Young Hearts Be Free Tonight"", ""Downtown Train""- neither of which are on this album). However, there's one particular cut of his that I've really taken a liking to: the disco-riffic ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" After many fruitless attempts to find this song on CD single (I'm not into that MP3 download technology yet), I was forced to grab a full album that had this particular cut on it. As you may've guessed, this offering is the one I selected. Of course, I had to shell out quite a few more shekels for all those other cuts I didn't really care for. Fortunately, I've found one way to maximize the value of this purchase: I use the CD case as a coaster for my drink. True, the liner notes sheet gets a bit soggy on occasion- but it's not like I'm interested in reading what's on it anyway, so it's no big loss to me...`Late"
3,Rod the mod.,"At this point, there are numerous collections out of Rod Stewart. This original ""Greatest Hits"" has alot of the good stuff, but since it was a vinyl era release, we only get 10 tracks. Even twice the number of songs would still be the basics. This disc also needs remastering desperately. It plays much quieter than most of my other CDs. I wont even begin to mention what's missing here, I'll just say that the most casual fan would still enjoy this. Anyone else should look into ""The Very Best Of"", or even the ""Downtown Train"" collection."
3,Best Of?,"Not a bad album, but it is missing a key track, ""You Wear It Well"". It also might have been nice if ""(I Know) I'm Losing You"", had been included, but this particular album was released by Warner Brothers, and those songs were on the Mercury label, so, we are lucky ""Maggie May"" even makes an appearance. In my opinion, there is no truly comprehensive collection available for Rod, unless you go with the ""Storyteller Anthology"", which can be a bit overwhelming for someone just looking for the hits."
3,Incomplete hits,"Besides the overwhelming pink of the cover which to me is emblematic of Rod's descent into singalong commercialism, my problem with this album is that some of the greatest hits have been omitted. In 1971, Reason To Believe was a huge hit at the same time as Maggie May, so should have been included. Two other authentic rock numbers, You Wear It Well and Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda) are missing too. The good stuff includes his 1979 nod to disco, D'ya Think I'm Sexy, The Killing Of Georgie, a great message song and the two tuneful ballads, Sailing and First Cut Is The Deepest. So although this isn't a bad album, it is incomplete at best. There are many Best Of collections available that contain more of Stewart's good music from his solo career and with The Faces."
4,"Limp Requiem, but Bonney is lovely in the songs","The highlight of this CD isn't the main work but the 13 songs of Faure performed by Barbara Bonney and her then-hsuband Hakan Hagegard. She in particular is very special in this repertoire, not singing with perfect idiomatic French but sitll using her delightful lyric-coloratura with real artistry. Not since the young Kathleen Battle have these Faure gems sounded so good.Bonney is also a standout in the Requiem, where Hagegard comes off as rather colorless and lacking in religious fervency in the Libera Me. But it's probably Ozawa who's to blame, since his conducting is often limp instead of reverent. Maybe he equates the two. Orchestra and chorus, as you'd expect, are flawless. If only one didn't feel that the music was being laid out on a table in the morgue. My four-star rating is for the songs."
2,Boring. Don't waste your time.,"There are hundreds of gay-themed movies out there that can provide the cliché message this movie conveys with a better acting crew, a more interesting plot, and hotter actors. This $2.99-budget film failed."
2,Why?,"Why are gay romance films such a downer. This one was no exception. I don't like to give bad reviews, but this one was a struggle to keep watching, and predictable. There was simply no heat, no reason to continue to the end. It is such a struggle to find American made films which satisfy the story/sex/and deeply involve the viewer to actually care about the characters.When are we going to make films worth pumping our fists for? I am a huge fan of MM romance and film, and rarely see anything I would recommend. I bought this one, but it inevitably will be given to someone and not retained as part of my permanent collection.Some may enjoy the light premise and no lack of butts, so give it a try if you think it's for you. Not for me. Shallow and needed a good strong plot."
2,Disappointing,After seeing two of this director's films I thought a third would be good. This was disappointing. The acting is terrible. The quality of the picture and the audio are good. For that I give it two stars. The people giving five stars must really like these actors or something because I fail to see how anyone can give five reviews to this film!
1,Unbelievable..............,"I cannot believe the previous reviews. This is without doubt the worst gay movie I have ever seen. The storyline is almost non existent, and the acting by ALL of the participants, beggars belief ! Just what kind of an tiny incestuous world do these sad individuals inhabit ?About the only thing good about this travesty of a movie is that at least the picture is in focus most of the time. everything else about this apology for a gay movie is laughable.Try 'Undertow' or 'Leos Room' or 'Plan B' or 'Release'. or anything else for that matter, but please don't DON'T waste your money on this crap !"
3,It's OK,"Based on the first few reviews, I couldn't wait to see this movie. Have to say, it was a bit of a disappointment. Kind of slow. Not bad, but not worthy of five stars, either."
5,"Wonderful story about love lost, internal conflict, and love found","This movie is not what I expected, it was a lot more. The cinematography is fantastic. And the story line actually had a theme. Thanks for a tastefully and thoughtfully produced movie about conflict, consequences, and intimacy."
3,"Sloooooooow - but it did move, kind of.","Role Play was, well, kind of, OK it was very slow! Enjoyed the actors, but not the performances. Both seemed to play themselves as they read their lines. Non the less it is a gay romantic comedy and those are my fave movies. Worth renting for $1 but not to buy..."
1,Too much bla bla bla,"If Oscars were given for the amount of spoken words in films, ""Role/Play"" would have been a serious candidate to this award.I really wished that this time it would be at least an average gay theme movie (concerning that both leading actors have already starred in tedious pictures, I hoped they developed a bit...).Wishful thinking.The charaters are paper-thin. It seems that the only thing they can show-off are their butts...There are some scenes so sweet that I got an tooth-ache :( And some which could be edited without influencing the rest of the film.An american production without typical ""happy-ending""? Not this time!A special credit should be paid to the guy who portrayed the agent of troubled soap opera star. HIS TEETH BLINDED ME.The plot itself is poor, with too many dialogues, which apparently should make it ""more elaborate"". But they didn't.AVOID."
1,Just Plain Sucked,"The actors sound particularly fake. The plot is even less believable. I was attracted to it by the great reviews, and I so wish I could get my money back; I couldn't stand to watch more than 10 minutes of it. A HUGE disappointment."
3,Passionate,"Sexy, sensual, it's worth seeing if you like gay movies...good date movie... cute, hot guys... add it to your list."
4,better than expected,"Back in 1994, if you didn't have a computer, this was one of the best options for playing Doom. Although the viewing window is somewhat small, the game plays very fast as a result. The sound is superb, and this version smokes the SNES version (although that version is also impressive for what it is). The only problem is that there is no battery save or password save, so you have to keep the system on if you want to keep going."
5,Not just for the youth or youth workers,"I initially thought this book was going to be geared toward youth and youth workers with all the talk of culture, but I quickly realized the simple and biblical truth of ""loving God and loving people"" that Kary focuses on applies to any culture. The concepts in this book can easily be applied to business culture where I find myself struggling. I enjoyed the book so much I am purchasing it for a friend who is heading to Africa on a month long mission's trip."
5,not only for the young,"When I was young, I was taught to be a separatist,in some ways this was a good thing, on the other hand it kept me from the people that needed me most. I now think I have become more of a conformist, something I am not proud of. I know that Kary's book helped me to see, that transforming into the person I should be will change my life forever. He give such insight on what God wants for me.The journey towards Relevance, is a book I couldn't put down, it kept my interest until I finished."
4,Known as a film landmark,"I haven't seen this film yet, but I wanted to balance the one dismissively negative review on here. ""A Woman of Paris"" is much admired for its pioneering use of subtlety and suggestion, and sounds like a fine drama. I haven't seen ""Sunnyside"" yet, either, but it is generally known as one of the weakest of Chaplin's independent shorts."
2,Chaplin's worst,"A woman of Paris is a miserable excuse for a movie, however the film short, ""Sunnyside"" is pretty good though."
3,the legend,this is one of the best oakenfold cd's out there.the first two songs really makes the cd's wroth buying and listening to.it is one of the rarest cd's on the market.i recommend this cd to all true paul oakenfold fans.
5,"If you love Gogol Bordello, you'll enjoy this recording.","If you love Gogol Bordello, you'll enjoy this recording. It has all of their raucous swagger, just framed with a house/electronic esthetic. No, it's not ""Starbucks"" music. Roma, Russian, Yiddish, Spanish strains with Hutz's mischievous growls give a lot of life to what is really a party recording. One can thoroughly love the authentic forms that they draw from yet still enjoy this wild, corrupted music."
5,"High Energy, Pure Genius","If you like high energy music, this CD is an absolute must buy. I've seen Gogol Bordello twice in New Orleans and the energy level at the show is absolutely off the chart. This CD mixes Gogol Bordello madness with a bunch of a bunch of other musical styles. Buy it now."
2,Nothing like the live show,I saw Gogol Bordello on the Vans Warped tour and was really impressed. They had a great live show so I rushed off and bought this CD. When I first got it I was completly disapointed to hear this blend of disco-hip-hop-gypsy music. I wanted the more punk influenced music they had at their live show. But after a while this CD grew on me and I don't completly hate it.
4,(Call Me) The Travelling Man,"This album contained the only remaining song in my list that I had not yet purchased in CD form so I was very happy. There were some other songs that were enjoyable so that was an added bonus. Now, if only someone could produce Eddie Daniels's ""Morning Thunder,"" Eloise Laws's ""Eloise,"" Lonnie Liston Smith's ""Gotcha,"" and Wilbert Longmire's ""With All My Love"" in CD form then the entire search would be over."
4,documents an underappreciated contribution by women,"The text shows the results of 10 years research onsite in those countries mentioned in the title. Kampwirth provides an account of an underappreciated aspect of the guerrillas. The significant involvement of women at many levels of the movements. She was able to interview women who had been active participants, since the events covered were as recent as the 1970s. While in fact most of the struggles happened in the 1980s.For future historians, this book will be valuable as original source material. It may well be that the definitive assessment of the turbulant events of the 1980s and 1990s has yet to be written. We are still too close. The problem is that by the time that assessment happens, many of the participants will likely be dead. And the dominant documentation thus far existing focuses on the top level commanders, who are mostly male."
5,good field guide for the field,beautiful illustrations and good quick reference info.size makes it a great field guide to carry.not as detailed as some other texts on each species behavior and life histories
3,The Marine Mammal Bible,"This Guide to Marine Mammals of the World is a long-awaited new addition many years in the making, and the result is impressive and unique. With five hundred page s of detailed description on the many mammals swimming beneath our seas, as well as beautiful color drawings and actual photos of these many mammals; it is a book that deserves a space on a shelf in every home by the sea. The book is not strictly for those with a scientific background, but then it is neither for the average person who happens to have a thing for whales. With applications on so many levels, the National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World is a book that no one will find dull and uninteresting in any way.Originally published in July/August 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...])."
5,A winner! Where's Disney with the movie!,"My 7-yr-old boy and 5-yr-old girl both were equally fascinated by the story and pictures. It moved to the top of the list overnight, beating out ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie"" and ""Bear Hunt."" Hey, Disney -- does anyone there read great children books like this? My kids want a movie!"
4,Sirius SCC1 Universal Tuner,Good product for a good price on amazon. This combined with the pioneer adapter let me listen to sirius radio.
1,Paid a pro to install-does not work to connect my Sirius-Saddening,I bought all the bells and gadgets recommended and needed to get full performance and I can still no connect to my satellite radio...I am sad about this perchase. :(
4,must have tuner,"I am a loyal Alpine guy so this item was needed to get Satellite radio to work on my deck. I hooked it up, as well as the interface piece, and everything works great. I have become a big fan of Satellite radio and no longer listen to anything else."
5,Exactly what i needed.,"I'm a Sirius radio guy. Switched to it a few years ago and havent looked back. I've had similar units installed into my cars by shops before and you'd think for the price they charge there is some magical spell with a high level of difficulty. Not the case this is a plug and play unit. People have gotten into my truck and said ""where did you have this installed?"" I respond ""my driveway."" Take your time and make sure you get the right connectors and you'll get a great sense of accomplishment and save a ton of money."
2,Didn't last,"Worked great, but burnt out after 4 months. I am disappointed in that I got rid of my free standing Sirius tuner that lasted 5 years for no reason"
2,Review of satellite sirius radio,"Im satisfied with the product, but i bought this with the kenwood 9960 and wasnt told that the sirius doesnt come with the cable connection for this stereo so after it arrived i had to buy the Kenwood CA-SR20V Sirius Connection Cable for 2008 Video Unit, u shoud always recomend buyers to get it when they are buying this kind of stereo."
1,DOA,"Seem to have gotten a non-working unit right out of the box. After talking to four different people at Sirius, all they could determine was an ""install error"". Install error on a plug-n-play unit with only two connections? When I say ""No data or audio out"", short of a cable not connected, that only means one thing - bad unit."
2,think it mite be bad,have it connect to a ottonavi unit when the gps speaks it change channel when sound comes back on can't say for sure that it is the tuner
1,Can't use is outdated,This unit is outdated and would not fit my application. From what I have found out since will not fit any new model.
3,The second one worked fine,The first one I received and installed would cut in and outall the time. After trying to adjust the antenna and talking toSirius I came to the conusion it was a faulty unit. So I returnedit to Amazon and got a replacement. The second receiver worksfine but it was a lot of extra work switching the units and I evenhad to pay a $15 activation fee with Sirius to activate the secondunit. But it does work fine now
3,Not too bad,"Great product fairly easy to install as long as you buy the other connector piece needed and its cool to have satellite radio through the double din as opposed to external displays. Only gripe is that I have signal problems every so often where it says acquiring signal especially around buildings in the city, however part of this problem may be attributable to the windshield tint."
2,Overly bulky...,"I don't like this unit. Pain to install behind the dash, way too big, and it died after 6 months of use (I believe - I can still get station information, but no audio). This, on top of the fact that I was paying $180 a year to listen to 3 Sirius channels led me to realize that it'd make more sense to cancel my Sirius subscription."
4,I like it.,This product arrived on time in perfect condition and we had it installed by Best Buy. It works great in our car.
4,Good Deal,"Good deal for the price, great service. No talk radio with this one. That's my fault, should have done my homework."
5,Excellent Book!,"This is the stuff they don't teach you in school! It's in English, French, German, Spanish, Portugese, Italian and I can't remember what else (oops:). Fantastic for anyone, including sections on both hetero- and homosexual lingo, ""group"" activities, safe-sex, greetings, getting-to-know-you stuff, and more. You WON'T be disappointed. This book is great fun!"
5,She's right.,"Yes, I couldn't agree anymore. Mrs First Lady of France, Carla Bruni is so right about this book: informative and good language practice for the self-explanatory purpose. Though her recommendation was released some 14 years ago, it is still valid today. She is a visionary of love and sex in different languages.Merci beaucoup, Carla."
3,Very green,"The top notes are fresh white flowers and very pleasant, but that only lasts a moment and then you're stuck with a very green smell. Overall it's not bad but a bit too aldehydic for me (like most older Chanel fragrances)."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea...,"I'm a huge vidnaObmana fan, of his earlier work, that is. I much prefer his ambient minimalist pieces to his later experimentation, so keep that in mind as you read my review. In and of itself, this work is interesting enough, but what's disappointing is that it is much closer to mainstream electronica than VO has ever come before. If you're a fan of this later period of his, then I guess you'll like this. I myself prefer his The Trilogy or Memories Compiled style of works. Also, his work with Sam Rosenthal, Terrace Of Memories, is probably the best work both artists have ever done.For those of you who share my sensibilities and still want a work that is an interpretation of Hell, check out Lustmord's classic, Heresy..."
2,Enough sugar to induce a diabetic coma.....,"But, if you like that sort of thing, this is for you. And the tunes by Jerry Herman are catchy, and well-orchestrated. The combination of Angela Lansbury and the already overly sweet part of Mrs. Claus is a dangerous combination. Another fine broadway veteran, Terrence Mann, appears on this recording, playing the villian, Mr. Tavish. It's a shame he only sings in one song, as he has the only part worth playing. Even the villian in this story is far too sweet."
5,Awesome Product,"I have used this product for years in my business. Excellent feedback from my patients. I initially learned of it from my Amish patients and they swear by this stuff...well maybe not swear. lol Anyway, they will buy 4 or 5 bottles at a time for their ailments. Good stuff to help heal soft tissue injuries."
2,2 1/2...Feels to Industial,"I love Black Metal, and I belive the old school stuff is the best. After experimenting with bands such as Darkthrone and Mayham, I decided to give Old Mans Child a try. Hmmmm..I wasnt as pleased as I thought I was going to be. This album gets a lot of high praise, but they sound just like Cradle of Filth, but I belive Cradle of Filth is much better. Even though COF seems to get bashed for being to mainstream, I think this sounds mainstream for being called ""Black Metal"" . In fact there are only 2 songs that sound like true Black Metal, and the rest just seems a bit to overdone and to industrial. Its an Ok album, but if you want ""True"" Black Metal try Darkthrone, Mayham, Venom, and I even recomend Cradle of Filth, as they are way better musicans."
3,This was good...,"Old Man's Child is good black metal yes...but to hide in the shadows of Dimmu Borgir for so long and now just bursting out??? c'mon...their albums back in the day crushed and its sad that they are just now trying to become known for their work...i do still prefer Dimmu Borgir over Old Man's Child, but lets get it together guys...show the world what you can do!!!now the review...i thought the album was lacking originality...it sounded too much like dimmu borgir...i mean, i understand that galder is the main song-writer but he is also a main member in Dimmu, and im sure his playing in that band rubs off on him in this one...no doubt...but at least try to differ the two.above all, the album got a 3 for being as good as it was, but only a 3 because of originality..."
2,Susan Lucci as she can play best,"Considering I only have seen the first half hour of this film (some of us have to work), I agree with the first reviewer who said Susan Lucci's acting is soap opera-ish at best. Susan seems past her heyday in this movie, and it's a role I thought would've been played better by a somewhat younger actress like Diane Lane or even Angelina Jolie. Susan looks old and haggard - makes me wonder what a guy like her lover actually sees in her, or why he would go to such extremes to attempt killing her rich husband. Here's a thought that crossed my mind - why do so many women married to wealthy men think their lives are so bad that they have to cheat? If I was married to someone with money I would just appreciate that I don't have to work and can spend my days looking pretty and shopping. So much for marrying for love."
4,Van Halen's sophomore hit!,"Contractually,Van Halen put out their second album just one year after their self-titled debut. This was 1979,and it was originally released on Warner Bros. new label design,which was solid white. This design lasted through the vinyl phaseout which began in 1989. The album opens with YOU'RE NO GOOD,first recorded by Linda Ronstadt on her 1974 album,HEART LIKE A WHEEL. DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY was the only Top 20 hit on the album. All the other songs are good."
4,Great Rock Album,"This is, without a doubt, a great album. It has a variety of music styles. It is no match for their previous album, their self-titled debut, however ""You're No Good"" and ""Dance The Night Away"", the first two tracks, are ones you'll remember for a long time."
3,Van Halen - Somebody Get Them A Doctor........,"Van Halen II is definitely a step down from the band's debut to my ears. Starting the album off with two straight covers gained them hits, but is not very original, and seems to be an indication of a struggle to come up with new material. This album always seemed like a summer party album to me. Great to listen to as background music at the beach or rolling around in your car with the windows down, but not something that I would take out for a serious headphone listen at home. Eddie shines on ""Spanish Fly"", and ""Somebody Get Me A Doctor"" and ""Bottoms Up"" are both patented David Lee Roth rants, but overall I find this album rather ho hum, and I think the first album blows it away."
5,Not the debut album but a great follow-up!,"I like all the David Lee Roth, Van Halen cds so this too gets 2 thumbs up. Ahhhh Beautiful Girls..mmmm"
3,A Nice Fairwell to the 70s,"While the 1st VH remains my favorite, I really did enjoy this one as well. It's noptably softer than their 1st one, but then we wouldn't want every record to sound the same.The cover of 'You're No Good' is a decent opener. 'Dance the Night Away' has an almost disco sound to it. 'Somebody Get Me a Doctor' has its energy. 'Bottoms Up' kind of goes against my nature. 'Outta Love Again' has an almost heavy metal sound to it. 'Light Up the Sky' is pleasant. 'Spanish Fly' is a nice instrumental. 'DOA' has kind of a sick charm to it. 'Women In Love' has a nice sound. 'Beautiful Girls' finishes the record in a typical Diamond Dave fashion.Overall, this record was a great farewell to the 70s."
4,Take it for What It's Worth...,"With an auspicious debut(tho' we hardly knew it at the time), Van Halen came on the hard rock scene in the late 70s with a full sound and an attitude that demanded, and yes, needed attention. VH II is a great balance that outdistances sophomore slump and makes one forget about an asskicking freshman effort. For my money, D.O.A. is one of the best hard rock songs to hit the pike. ""We were broke and hungry, on a summer day...They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away..."" I mean, come on!! This is lyric styling and loud Eddie gi-tarr at its best possible combination. Take that song, and the album (which, by the way, starts out with a Linda Ronstadt song! And what a lyricist she is/was???!!! ). This effort kept the party going. And it did a good job, at that."
4,A Worthwhile Follow Up,"Maybe not as earth shattering as the first release, this second batch of Van Halen goodies still stands pretty tall on its own. A little bit more pop flavored with Beautiful Girls, Women In Love, and the single Dance The Night Away balancing the rougher tracks. Plus the Spanish Fly thing is pretty charming too. Eddie still solos like a demon and Dave is very much in charge with the vocals. A winner this surely is."
5,"VH fans, this is a must have!","This CD, though maybe not *quite* as good as their first release, is still an all time classic. Featuring great songs, like Light Up the Sky, Dance the Night Away, Beautiful Girls, Somebody Get Me a Doctor, and more, this is a must have--not to mention that there is only one true singer for Van Halen, and that's Diamond David Lee Roth!"
5,Somebody get me a doctor,"An amazing follow up to one of the greatest debuts of all time. Opening with a cover of the Dee Dee Warwick B-side 'You're no Good' and then back to back singles 'Dance the Night Away' and 'Somebody Get Me a Doctor' this album never gives you a break. Just when you think they're going to let you catch your breath, Eddie takes it right away with the Classical guitar instrumental 'Spanish Fly'. The album finishes as strong as it starts with the third single 'Beautiful Girls'.This is truly an example of a band firing on all cylinders and proving that they were no flash in the pan."
3,"Decent follow up to ""Van Halen""","Van Halen II is a fine album from Van Halen. Not in the same league as their debut, but still pretty good. Diamond Dave hadn't got to annoying yet, and VH were able to come up with a good batch of songs. Highlights include: a cover of Linda Rondstats ""You're No Good"", Dance the Night Away"", Beautiful Girls, Bottoms Up, and DOA. If you liked Van Halen's first album you should like Van Halen II as well."
3,David Lee Roth,This is a 1979 sophmore effort by Van Halen when David Lee Roth was their singer. Overall this is a pretty mellow metal album. It went multi platinum. Technical wizardry by Roth & Eddie Van Halen. Stryper said they were the best band of all time. Key tracks are You're No Good & Dance the Night Away.
3,Not thier best effort!,Its ok and has a few good songs but in no way close to Van Halens other works with David Lee Roth (During an interview Eddie said he wishes he could do this album all over again or wipe it off the face of the earth)Not that bad but also not that good! And all the other people on here who say its a great album are just BIG Van Halen fans who rate all thier albums as great
3,Little disappointing after VH1,"This album is not well produced and song set is made of too gentle and radio-friendly tracks.1 You're no good - good mid tempo blues rock song(cover of Linda Rondstadt's song - but who the hell heard about her??) Great guitar - vocal dialogue at the end, beautiful solo. 8/102 Dance the night away - pop oriented song, 6/103 Somebody get me a doctor - it's rocker but nothing special 7/104 Bottoms up - funny rocker, sounds like recorded live, lot of laughs can be heard there 8/105 Outta love again - intro reminds... Hendrix, then it's strange rock song but weird vocals ruin this song- 7/106 Light up the sky - Good vocals, guitars, nice climat and finish -10/107 Spanish fly - eruption on acoustic guitar - less impressing for me - 8/108 D.O.A. raw rock song, nothing special - 7/109 Women in love - great semi ballad, beautiful guitar intro, song is really nice -10/1010 Beautiful girls - simple rock song with pop flavoured chorus -7/10"
5,Keep on Dancin'!,"""Dance the Night Away"" is one of the greatest pop songs ever recorded! Play this song anywhere and you've got an instant party!"
4,One of the best early VH cd's,If U like VH one needs to own at least one of first 3 albums! Dimond Dave's vocals superb! Eddie's guitar flawless! Michal Anthony's base thunderess! And Alex VH drumming keeping it all in time! Make my mouth water! Good Stuff!
5,Like Van Halen 1 and thats a good thing,"VH II is like a continuation of the first classic. It has the strong originals, Eddies solo(this time on acoustic) and the cover song, ""you're no good"". Good second album, no musical growth here, but still just as good as the first."
5,Awesome follw up album,Another album from the seventies that was again well ahead of its time. Powerful riffs and an awesome acoustic guitar solo. Buy it!
5,Very Underrated,"This album is a VH great with all other DLR series albums. The sophmore album Van Halen II doesen't live up to it's groundbreaking debut, Van Halen, but is still a very respectable recording compared to other music today. The great sounding ""Light up the sky"" and who can't love the riff in ""D.O.A""? Songs like ""Dance The Night Away"", ""Beautiful Girls"", ""Women In Love"" are all soft but still pretty good. ""You're No Good"" is actually a cover song, I've heard it before from some disco/pop girls and thought it was weird they redid it. But the bass intro in the begining is a great start to the album. Not everyone likes it but it's got the music to demand respect. Another must for all VH fans."
4,Van Halen II (Never Received),Good morning all. I rarely encounter any problems when ordering CD's DVD's from Amazon. Unfortunately I have not received this particular order as of yet..... Amazon supplies a great tracking tool when an online order is placed. This order made it as far as Iowa. Unfortunately there was not a way to convey my concern to Amazon. Hopefully they will resolve this problem in a timely manor.
2,It's No 2,"Okay, I love the first album. This is pretty much an extension or rehash of that. It's got an acoustic version of eruption, the songs are okay but seem to be left overs and don't really compare with the first album. Move up, leave this one and get either the first album or some of their later albums"
3,Remastering doesn't do it justice.,"This whole thing has been noticeably, if only slightly, slowed down from its original tempo, and where's the original first track, ""Running with the Devil""? Look for this on cassette or vinyl instead. I don't believe the CD version sounds like the original recording. A great album like Van Halen II should be remastered for CD more carefully. On cassette and vinyl, it is easily Van Halen's best album, and arguably one of the best examples of guitar playing ever."
3,cheap clamps,"I used this kit for personal use and to give drum lessons. It didn't take long for the rack clamps to start snapping.Pros:The pads are awesome. Remo pads are the best.It's easy to set up.Aluminum bars are light weight and durable.Cons:The rack clamps are plastic and crack easily, rendering them useless.I was able to order rack clamps from Gibraltar which fit nicely. Unfortunatly, to replace all the Remo clamps with Gibraltar would cost about as much as buying a new practice set."
2,Only for the greatest of Feat enthusiasts,"This album was created using bits and pieces of an unfinished album found in Lowell's studio after his death. Be warned that Lowell never heard anything close to the final version of these songs. To credit him with co-production of ""Down on the Farm"" was a compliment to him at best and a commericial-backed white lie at worst. The truth is somewhere in between.Having said the above, I'm still glad his buddies released it because it gave the world a few more nuggets of his slide work and amazing voice to hold onto in his absence."
3,Be one now...,"The last Little Feat LP recorded before Lowell George's untimely death in '79. The production (very much in the Southern California smooth R & B of the time) is credited to George ""... with a little help from his friends."" Most of his songwriting contributions are collaborations with others. The album has the feel of a compromise between George's sensibilities and the jazz-rock fusion leanings of Bill Payne and Paul Barerre. Not a bad listen at all, just don't expect to hear the inspired madness of ""Dixie Chicken"" or ""Feats Don't Fail Me Now."""
2,Missing Lowell's vocals,"My problem with this album is that somewhere between 1980 and now they switched one track out. When the album was released on vinyl the track ""Front Page News"" was sung by Lowell George and lasted an entire minute longer. The backing track is also very different and sped up. I am very dissappointed because I have looked for his version of the song(far superior to Payne's version) and have not been able to find it. If anyone knows what album released has it I would like to here. The album while not perfect is a very nice listen and I think an important epitaph for Lowell (especially with this song)"
4,Very good,I think this book it's a very deep and complete guide about the application of physic to te medicine. I recommend this book to the student and to the theacher .
5,Deep Purples most underrated offering.,Bought this many years back on vinyl... Had to get it again on CD... Introspective lyrics and of course great guitar/organ work.
2,He's done better,"I did not like this album, but that is only my personal opinion. Judge for yourself. I vastly prefer his Exodus album which I thought was excellent."
3,Tight And Precise,"Twangin' was recorded as Rockpile was in the process of breaking up, and where the previous Rockpile collaborations were loose and rocking, Twangin' is tight and precise, as if Edmunds recorded it on his own. Only on ""The Race Is On"" does the record truly cut loose, and he's backed by the Stray Cats on that one. Still, there are a number of fine moments on the record, particularly in the pseudo-new wave pulse of John Hiatt's ""Something Happens,"" the pub rock of Mickey Jupp's ""You'll Never Get Me Up (In One of Those),"" and the gorgeous Everly-esque ""(I'm Gonna Start) Living Again if It Kills Me."" The rest of the record is pleasant filler which could have used some of the old Rockpile spark. - Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide"
3,Not his best; FAR from his worst!,"The last ""real"" Dave Edmunds album before he hooked up with Geoff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra and things went horribly wrong.Some good tunes on here, but overall the album lacks the fire and passion of his earlier stuff (Get It, Tracks on Wax, Repeat When Necessary, DE7). Still, I'd rather listen to this than 90% of the other junk out there. This is American roots rock done up 100% authentic, even if he is a Welshman!"
3,Practical ideas in Pottery,"Pottery Making has many good ideas and projects, especially for teachers of pottery and for children. The articles are clearly written and easy to understand. I enjoy reading it."
1,Delayed delivery.,Imagine my surprise when discovering that a magazine subscription to this publication will take 3-4 MONTHS do deliver. If ordered directly it would require only WEEKS. I would have canceled immediately but the action was not allowed. Love the magazine and discount but let a person know of the delayed delivery out front. This was intended as a gift so causes some embarrassment.
2,Why is it taking so long?,I ordered this magazine for my mom on Dec. 1st and she will not recieve the first copy until March something. I may have ordered another pottery magazine had I known it would take so long for her to receive the first copy. However-nothing against the magazine itself. It is a great magazine for potters or those interested in pottery.
4,TOO EXPENSIVE,"Wonderful recording. But it has as of 2009 been reissued by EMI at 21.98. This cheaper version, however, does not contain a libretto."
5,hoppin john,"This is another Zatarains food that is very hard to find. I like it a lot. I hope I can continue to find it on Amazon. I add some sausage, ham or bacon to this to make it work well for me."
3,generic eighties-style rock,"I got this cd because I heard they had a connection to the band Voodoo Six, a newer group that a really like -- also, because I heard they were the first band signed to the label run by Steve Harris. It sounded promising: another great band that had mysteriously gone unnoticed, only to be discovered by the die-hard searchers like me. Unfortunately, there is nothing to get too excited about here. This is a solid album, but it has been done a thousand times before, and none of the songs really grabbed me or made me want to crank the volume to eleven. If you don't have it already, get the Voodoo Six cd instead."
1,Incompatible with my system,The vendor shipped the product immediately and in good condition.There wasn't enough information about the product to warn me that it might not be compatible with my system. It isn't compatible. I hope I can return it.
3,"Very Interesting, but Verbose","This could have been one of the best pastiches ever had the author not fallen into the trap of having her characters speak in 'Victorian diction'. One of the joys of the original Holmes stories is that he speaks plain English even though he is a genius. The stories are marvels of understatement and humor, qualities that are lacking here. There are many good ideas in the story and a few that made me cringe. How long does a dog live? Would people really carry on like that in front of the servants? And lastly, is there no other word besides 'lad' that can be used to describe a young boy? The presence of a good editor might have helped this book greatly. As for the subject matter, if you like pastiches, this is worth a read. If you don't, you won't."
2,I wondered how this got published...,"This book is so irritatingly verbose and in need of a hacksaw-bearing editor that I wondered if it a vanity publication. Sure enough, Galde Press authors ""share"" the costs of printing and production. Beware!"
3,A Very Moving Book,This is the story of a young girl who was molested by herfather and how the abuse affected her life. Very poignant.
5,He's Back Again!,"A littel soul, R&B rap all blended in. Jon B surprised us just when we thought he wasn't coming back. The CD is really mellow and nonchalant, it let's you feel a little cool and relaxed. I give it to Jon B because alot of people didn't think he could do it but he came back with this CD and he came back strong!"
3,Good to Mediocre Album,"Has a few great tracks but if you want my honest opinion, not as good as his previous album. Not worth the buy..."
5,Don't Talk Dance!!,"I first saw this video on BET. The CD is awesome. It is an balanced mixture of rap, r&b and slow jams. Jon B is great."
2,Jon b. needs better editing to avoid quantity over quality,"Jon B. needs better editing on his latest. This is the third release, however the first jon b. that failed to knock me off my feet. Don't get me wrong, Jon shows hints of his earlier talent, but it falls too wide and far in between. He's hidden pleasureable parts amongst goobles of junk that only a sanford listener could enjoy. Most discouraging is that Jon has traded in his babyfacique falsetto and boy band soft tenor and replaced it with a slick pursue the young lady in the club mumble which comes up short more often than not. He has done ballads better than the boy groups who command hundreds of reviews on this site. With consistency with quality over quantity (over 13 tracks this time out), he might eventually garner the same kind of attention."
3,SHOCKED,"This new album really surprised me! I thought Jon's vocal ability would improve from the first two albums but it seems as if his lead vocals got worse. His lead vocals were not polished at all. Not only was he out of key, his runs were very sloppy. I don't know what he was trying to accomplish by slurring his words. I just expected more from Jon B. especially when he had three years to put this new album together. I gave it three stars because the tracks and lyrics were tight."
3,Ooookay...........,"After hearing ""Don't Talk"", I was so excited about this CD coming out. I had been hearing that the CD was supposed to be really good. I listened to the whole thing already and I'm a little disappointed. I thought he would have had more songs you can dance to, but that isn't the case. I should have just had it burned or downloaded it off the web."
2,bonafed up,"another whiteboy acting black n sync, and backstreet can sure learn a lot from jon b especially when it comes to how to trteat a sista."
3,SHOCKED!,"This new album really surprised me! I thought Jon's vocal ability would improve from the first two albums but it seems as if his lead vocals got worse. His lead vocals were not polished at all. Not only was he out of key, his runs were very sloppy. I don't know what he was trying to accomplish by slurring his words. I just expected more from Jon B. especially when he had three years to put this new album together. I gave it three stars ONLY because the tracks and lyrics were tight."
2,George Michael Lite,not only from the Album Cover which is just like George Michael's Older Cover but also from His Musical Style.Jon B.is Cool&His Style Passes through but as with His Other Material it is Hit&Miss&aside from a few songs there isn't much there to wanna listen to say a year later.all the duets hurt His Project as with many other projects out over the last few years.when I hear most of His Material it's like George Michael Left-overs except George Michael still matters.
3,"Good tips, too much bla bla",This book has good tips. Sometimesthe writer just talks too much about one subject. Although there are grey boxes with the short version. It's a good book. I recommend it.
4,Good Book filled with Helpful Stories as Examples,"This is a good book for people that are looking to learn some great quick tactics about conversation. It's for people that enjoy reading Chicken Soup for the Soul type of books. There's a lot of examples using stories, they are short, but they don't necessarily go into detail for those that are looking for technical breakdown on how conversation works.I would suggest taking a few things from the book to start practicing first, and take it one day at a time for the tips you think are relevant to you."
2,not impressed,"Not crazy about this book, only half way through. The content is very basic common sense ideas that you dont have to read about to know. Save your money."
1,Overrated!,This book might be alright if you are truly a complete social reject. The advice is so commonplace and mundane that it's insulting. These are BASIC social skills kids learn when they are young. Very disappointing.
2,Only if you really do not understand people,"Not a bad book, but really only useful if you have never dealt with social situations. Talking to people about things they are interested in, facing them when you talk, body language, it's all pretty simple stuff. If you have never considered any of this, the book may help, but it's a bit disturbing to think that some people never consider the basics of human communication and need a book to tell them to do so."
1,This book sucks.,"This book sucks. It's written by a four year old. For example, one sentence reads 'Are there data correct?' They meant, 'Is their data correct?' Also, they don't really have any tricks, it's total B.S."
3,Caffeine please!,"This book does not have alot of new or fresh ideas and is a little dull. Most of the stuff (thus far) is common sense. If you have very many decent communication skills already, I doubt you will find this book super useful. I am halfway through the book and have learned relatively little new information. However, if you struggle some with your communication skills, it might be a good book for you."
1,Slightly worse than useless,"If you have ever been annoyed by excessive triteness, glibness, superficial charm, grandiosity, or alliteration, this is not the book for you.I find it deeply troubling that a person with such a strong undercurrent of snobbery and contempt for people in general would tout themselves as a communications expert.I checked this out of the library on CD in my efforts to advance my business communication, and I have no intention of accepting advice from someone like this author.Except yes, I probably *should* evaluate my smiles and other facial expressions in the mirror.And yes, I suppose I shouldn't smile too big too soon and give away the store all at once.But the sound of this woman's voice fills my throat with bile and I honestly consider her in more contempt than the author of ""How to Marry the Rich,"" which I received as a gag gift from my husband.If you really want a primer on talking with people, ""The Fine Art of Small Talk"" by Debra Fine is a better first step."
3,Bragging Is Not Cute!,"The book in general gives some fine advice for small-talking and can be used for such purpose, however, concerned one is with the constant reference to the authors friends - in ANY situation. This comes off as bragging and as such gives the reader grounds for questioning the limits of the book. Can all of the 92 little tricks really be implemented in daily life, or is it simply superficial bragging of ""accidental incidents"" that have occurred in the life of the authors friends?With willpower anything seems possible, this can be used as argument for the tricks, however, in my mind the author is simply bragging, which diminishes the level of trust one can place into the book.Leil, it's a good book, but clear out some of the ""name-dropping"" - we don't need to know it's a story about YOUR friend all the time, and we don't need to know all about their success."
3,Good book,"It was a quick read and it is a good book but eventually you will remember only parts of it and not every relationship works this way.I listened to the audio book and for some reason her voice is very annoying, is it because she is tone deaf? or just the way she talks?"
4,Another great book to help guys with women.,"This is a great book for men and women and will help broaden your social skills.For guys this book is ideal way to learm more techniques when picking up and talking with women.I also recommend this book and the following(for men):1)""U.S.S"".(Also)By Leil Lowndes.(means:undercover sex signals).2)""Date out of your league:for men only"".By April Masini.3)""How to pick up beautiful women:secrets every man should know"".By John Eagan."
3,Not Bad,"If this is the type of information you are looking for, it is not a bad read. At my age it is just a little hard to remember 92 tricks lol"
2,Mostly Terrible,"I bought this book at an airport. I don't consider myself to be a very good social communicator so the cover and the taglines did their job and sold it for me. Some of the tips I'd consider useful, some may be obvious to some and not to others, many are just plain bad. The authors voice, including references to the perceived social strata is also really irksome. I'm not a fan of the hokeyness that inexplicably infests self-help literature, but this book is on another level. It's hard to suggest that you look around for another book - if this one has 4.5 stars then how reliable are the amazon ratings? Do look elsewhere though!!!"
3,A review of the reviewers,"Reviewers fall into two camps. The first camp gives high marks, 4/5 or 5/5. The second camp gives low marks, 2/5 or 1/5. The reviews of the second camp are marked by ridicule of the book's simple minded ideas, stupid suggestions, etc. etc. You don't ridicule ideas unless you have better ones. So why were they looking for books in the 'art of conversation' category since they already have better ideas? Hard headed people never learn."
2,Kindle - Table of Contents,I think this book was rushed to get a Kindle version out and they sacrifice the Table of Contents. The table of contents was very difficult to read as it was not fit to appear on a single page. By this I mean you could only read the left side before having to scroll to the right to finish reading. It was also very difficult to navigate using the table of contents. I was not able to click on the various chapters to skip ahead or back.
5,"Excellent, Applicable Advice","Leil Lowndes not only writes a practical, ""how-to"" for day-to-day social interactions, she does it with charm and appeal. The subject matter is that which could become drab and monotonous if written by an author with less concern for his or her audience. Lowndes, being the master of communication that she is, takes care to keep her reader entertained and engaged. Be on the lookout for how she weaves the actual concepts into her writing. Very clever!In addition to the skillful composition, this book excels as a practical and applicable tool for any person, regardless of profession, age, or status. Lowndes demonstrates how to accomplish the tip she's imparting, and gives examples of the results you can expect if you master it. This book recaps the advice very well, ensuring that even the distracted reader will retain the most important concepts.This was a highly enjoyable and beneficial read. I recommend it to anyone who seeks to be a better communicator."
4,Really helpful in socializing,"It's a really good and helpful book for me.I exactly was looking for tips in socializing andbeing able to communicate better and this book gave me whatI really needed.The price was also good, it's paperback and for those whohave some concerns about printing quality, like me, it's great and eye-friendly.Overall, a book that is really worth reading. I think it's worthevery pennies I spent on it."
1,Don't knock Dale Carnagie,"I lost all respect for this book when the author started knocking Dale Carnagie's principles. I took the Dale Carnagie courses, and they are not like this guy says. Apparently he is speaking out of heresy, and I can hear he has not idea what he's talking about."
2,I'm not sure about this one,The fact that she doesnt have many (if any) credentials left me wondering if all she had was good writing skills.
4,Great little book,"Learned a lot from this little book. Lots of tips and directions for shy persons to use to talk with people. I put some of them to use right away with nice results. Shy folks like me don't pick up on things like this easy, so it was nice to read simple directions for ways of interacting that might come intuitively to the extroverted, non-shy people of the world."
4,Get this book,"There are a lot of books on theories and what you SHOULD DO, this book as well as ""Talking the Winners Way"" offers some REAL steps on how to communicate better! It gives you practical advice and doesn't bombard you with theories or idealism, but gets direct to the point about the behaviors that you have to exhibit and use in order to change your current communication style. What to change to be ""better"" at something? Get this book! I can not recommend it enough!"
4,from shy to charismatic,Wonderful read. this book really details how to converse and mingle. I am a self proclaimed shy guy and this has done wonders. keep it Mrs. lowndes
1,Book title is misnamed,"The title of this book should have been The Fine Art of Manipulation, because that's all it's about. So if you prefer pretending and manipulating, instead of genuinity and honesty in relationships, then this is the book for you."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I think the book lost a little credibility when it referenced NLP practitioners. There have been three major aggregate studies in psychology which have shown that NLP is pretty much a pseudoscience.The author is too verbose; I think the book could have conveyed the same message while having a third of the current word count. On the plus side, there is a box for each chapter that shows the technique in one paragraph.I found the hierarchical social perspective of the author a little condescending (""lesser dog"" is one of those descriptors that I found questionable).Most of the techniques presented in this book are/have:- unsubstantiated suggestions (only a hand-few of the techniques are supported by studies).- a low chance to see application by most people.- minor positive effects for most people.I think the application of all techniques will have a positive expected value for most people, but it will not be major."
3,Great for 3 weeks....,"This speaker set was definitely and upgrade over the 5.1 Onkyo speakers I had , but that lasted for only 3 weeks. That is when my subwoofer stopped working. Because I bought these online the only choice I had was to take it to the Infinity certified repair shop and have it fixed. It has been there for 3 weeks and I am still waiting to get it back."
1,Glosses over evrything important. Not enough information,I ordered several DVD's as i read mixed reviews on almost all. After watching this one I was very dissappointed. The video is like 40 minutes long and glosses over several important newborn care concerns. I also bought Bringing Baby Home: The Ultimate Baby Care DVD (2005) and i quickly realized that this DVD was much more hearty and spent more time explaining and showing you then ABC's did. Get that one instead!
3,Rent or borrow instead,"I am expecting my first baby in 6 weeks and I have a ton of questions on baby care! AlthoughABC's of Newborn Baby Careis comprehensive in terms of the range of topics (from choosing a pediatrician to car seat safety), the time spent on each topic is very brief. You may find you'll have more questions in the end than you started with after watching this DVD. The script and acting are also kind of cheesy.In comparison,Laugh and Learn About Newborn Baby Carewas more engaging and entertaining to watch. However, it only covers Bathing, Diaper Change, Dressing, and Swaddling.There are pros and cons to both DVDs. There are tips and techniques included in one that are not in the other. My suggestion is to rent or borrow instead. I got both at my local public library and I'm waiting for another DVD from Netflix,Bringing Baby Home: The Ultimate Baby Care DVD. Afterwhich, I'll decide which DVD I will purchase to keep as reference."
1,Not useful at all,"Maybe if you've never held a baby or truly are clueless about ANYTHING involving baby care it'll be tolerable for you. But those who need that much help will need something that actually goes into detail. For instance, the nursing part of the program is so short and only talks about a few things and doesn't even show a baby nursing. They actually even go through the steps of picking up a baby! It's pretty irritating and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,"GREAT DVD, ITS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD","VERY INFORMATIVE, GREAT IDEA, WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY THINK OF THIS BEFORE, I THINK IT WILL BECOME A BEST SELLER"
5,Superior Newborn Tips,This DVD on what to do when you get home with a newborn baby really had everything the entire family needed to know. No need to mess with cumbersome books. It was all visual and each picture was worth more than a thousand words. A book with all this info would have been too big to get in the door.The newborn baby nurse demonstrated on a boy which was most helpful at learning how to take care of both a circumscision and the healing umbelical cord which are so close together and need to be kept dry. That alone was worth the small price of the DVD. I'm taking this DVD to every baby shower from now on.
3,Unclear formate of product,I was unable to view the film as it was sent as a DVD instead of VHS. The TV to be used for teaching baby care has built in video. Therefore DVD was returned.
3,Okay with some problems,"Much of the content is pretty decent except for 2 areas: 1) storage of breast milk - on the DVD, the mom stores her breast milk on the refrigerator door - which is a big NO-NO. You are supposed to store breast milk inside the refrigerator. The temperature on the refrigerator door is not cold enough. 2). carseat safety - they don't really go over that much and you can tell on the DVD that the baby is strapped in incorrectly."
2,Are you serious?,"I bought this DVD for my sister who is expecting. I see that this DVD won awards but I don't know how. This video is cheesy and hard to watch. I would not recommend this video, it was not worth it."
5,Nervous Fathers-to-be...listen up,Nervous Fathers and Father's-to-be listen up. If you only watch one video... make it this one ! Forget all the cutesy girly books and dry 70's medical videos. This video cuts to the chase and gives you the fundamentals of what you need to know when little Jr gets home from the hospital and there is no nurse to bail you out at 3:30 am. A lifesaver for the first-time Dad.
5,Just what I needed,"With so much information out there on newborn care it can be very overwhelming. This dvd gives a visual to calm the anxiety. I don't think it claims to know everything, it just gives the ""abc's"" of newborn care. If it had as much information as a book it would probably be 3 hours long. This dvd is 45 minutes which was all I could sit through.This dvd is perfect for those who want to sit back and ""see"" the basics. I'm going to be a dad soon and this dvd really helped me. My wife read so many books that she had information overload. No one needs that before you deliver. This dvd hopes you gain ""confidence"" by watching. That's exactly what I gained."
4,"Roll-over Magnum, here comes Matt...","Finally, ""the powers that be"" have chosen to release this show on DVD. I was a big fan of Matt Houston back in the 80's when it came out, at least the first two season's. Not only because Lee Horsely is SO FINE, but I also had a huge crush on Pamela Hensley. In fact she was the main reason I started watching the show to begin with. I followed her from Buck Rogers to this show and really enjoyed the chemistry she had with Mr. Horsely. Anyway, I can't wait to purchase this DVD when it comes out in a couple of months. If you haven't seen this show but enjoyed other 80's detective shows such as Magnum P.I. or Simon and Simon, then you'll like this one too. Go MATT!!!"
2,Matt Houston DVD Set(Music Butchered On Pilot),"I was looking forward to getting the Boxset of Matt Houston primarily for the Pilot and found that the great music was replaced by ""The Chariot's Of Fire"" theme and other minor music changes. The reason why I remember this is because I DVD -r'd a copy from a beta tape about ten years ago and remember why I liked that Pilot so much.For me this is a major Paramount screwup. Why can't they just leave things alone and why do the idiot's have to make demands on the music that keeps us from enjoying these great shows.On the back of this package in microscopic print it says that the versions of the episodes are ""Edited"" and ""Some music has been changed""I am personally disappointed for that reason.. We have waited 28 years for this debacle?? very disappointed!!"
3,Matt Houston DVD's,I would be ecstatic with the purchase except for the fact that two out of six disks do not play. The other four were fantastic. I would be thrilled if there is a way to obtain a set that works completely. Then it would be a five star purchase.
3,SMART COLD WAR SPY GAMES,"The full metaphorical symbolism of an international chess tournament played against cold war intrigue is perfectly realized in DANGEROUS MOVES (Home Vision Entertainment). Winner of 1985's Best Foreign Film Oscar, the authentic tension in this nifty, nuanced thriller builds to a unexpected and satisfying climax. The less said here the better. The cast includes Liv Ullmann, Leslie Caron and Michel Piccoli. Extras include a conversation with producer Arthur Cohn. Recommended."
4,The Best,"Okay, when I saw this Cookbook, I just had to have it. I have the Original Bell's Best cookbook."
1,great music / bad mastering,First of all the track listings shown for this album correspond to the new remaster not this cd. The general sound of this cd is muffled (lack of high frequency and definition). After listening to this cd at an appropriate volume (loud) I was surprised to hear surface noise. My opinion is this was mastered from a vinyl LP.
5,"Different, but great","Graeme Edge, drummer for the Moody Blues, teamed up with Adrian Gurvitz (The Gun, Baker Gurvitz Army) to make some fantastic music. Not the Moody Blues, but outstanding in it's own way."
2,Forget the music off the LP and the CD,"The LP cover of this album has got to be one of the glossiest lushest gushiest colorful pieces of artwork I have ever seen on an LP (forget about the CD, the art work is so small, it is almost non-existent) Done by an artist called Petagno, it is quite an intriguing piece of work for an LP. The music is so-so tolerable with a few whispy brilliant moments but too few and far between. I've got this one framed as wall art."
5,Very small usefull External Drive,"For the money, this drive is very compact and handy. It worked perfectly for backing up our old files for transfering to our new computer. I think I will start backing up our old photos on this drive rather than on CD's. Has built in software if the drivers are needed. Great little product."
5,Love It!,"I love it -- it's small and easy to carry, but holds all the data I need for backup and taking around. Great product!"
4,Western Storage Dive,"I had a little ""is it saving my stuff or what?"" thing, but after the security thing you go through, then the syncing your stuff to the drive, you got to close it, then open it back up to drag n drop it. Anyway it doing just fine, no real problems. Get it if need to save a lot of stuff."
4,Just what I needed,"I needed an external HD to backup my 5 year old laptop so I purchased this drive. I was concerned about whether or not it would work, since I only have one USB 1.1 port and there were some reviews that said the drive might need an extra port if you didn't have enough bus power on the computer, however the drive works fine on my laptop. My only comment is that the WD Sync software that is included is not a true BACKUP program, but is designed to synchronize files, so I just use Windows XP Backup."
3,Recoomend,I bought this after having two Maxtor units that failed. No problems with the Western Digital. Works as intended. I use it to have the same data available on my desktop and laptop computers. Just plug it in!
5,Works fine on My MacBook,"Chiming in on the debate over how this works with Mac laptops...it spins up happily for my Titanium MacBook, running on the battery. Takes a few seconds to mount on the desktop, even on my main machine (a G5 tower). But it's got snappy response and is eminently portable. Had it a week and so far I'm happy with it."
1,"The drive didn't work! Had to send it back on ""my dime"".","I received the drive packed in air bag type of wrap. It was NOT in an ESD-safe bag, and I suspect maybe this is why it didn't work. When I got instructions of how to send it back to Western Digital for replacement, they insisted it be put in an ESD-safe bag. J&R Music world is who packed and shipped it. I put the drive in an ESD-safe bag when returning it just to comply with Western Digitals instructions. I had to pay for shipping back to Western Digital, and now I'm waiting for them to send a replacement."
4,"So far, so good","Works great so far, and I do not need an external power source for my XP platform. I have been putting a bunch of stuff on it, quick transfer time. Only problem I ran into so far is that I could not get my extra Win 2K computer to recognize it, but that is a minor problem."
2,Vista compatibility depends on Vista version,"When I bought this drive, I had Vista Home Edition installed on my PC. The drive was not compatible and Vista kept saying it could not locate drivers to install it. There are no such drivers available on Western Digital's website nor anywhere else I looked on the Internet. I later formatted my computer and installed Vista Ultimate Edition. When I plugged the drive in, Vista found it immediately and installed it. It now works flawlessly."
2,No instructions included is a bad idea,"I knew I needed to have a large venue to backup files, particulartly photos, and was encouraged by the description of this device being so easy: ""Just plug it in and go."" However, the information displayed on the screen is difficult to understand, unless you are familiar with the lingo. It's not clear what I should do for what. I'm frustrated, because I'm sure it would have been very simple to explain how to navigate--but no one has done that. One and a half thumbs down!"
4,Helpful Comments,"I just bought this, on sale @ Staples. I haven't used it yet, but I wanted to thank you all for your comments.When buying for computers, it's sometimes scary to think you've bought the wrong thing, and often they aren't returnable. Your 2 comments have put my mind at ease, and I'll try it later.I'm now on an iMAc and I love it. I did too much photo editing and my HP laptop crashed and burned.Backing up seems wise... thanks."
2,Generic Volume??,"After putting pictures onto it for the first time usage, I try to eject the device by clicking on the 'Saftly Remove Hardware' icon in the system tray and click on stop and it says ""Device 'generic volume' cannot be stopped right now. Try stopping the device again later"". This message keeps coming up all the time I use it. And I'm scared to remove the driver unless the computer is off. Is there any way of stopping the generic volume so i can remove the device? I am using windows XP.The rest is fine....quick, quiet, and good size..but I am not sure if it's reliable."
1,Pobre,"Lamentablemente, llego dañado y hacer de la garantia es costosa, ya que me encuentro en Caracas, Venezuela"
1,It broke....,"seemed fine. but stopped working w/n a month. surprising, because i have another one that has been great. will cost a bit to retrieve data off this external hard drive"
4,7th Heaven,"My son has Down's Syndrome and he migrates from one subject to another in videos but only after COMPLETELY saturating his mind with ALL content of the video. This is why I appreciate videos like 7th Heaven that is a clean show. He is now on his 2nd season of 7th Heaven (and I'm sure will continue to others until he has them all). Prior to these, it was wrestling - P U L E E S E!!!!It's such a change to switch to 7th Heaven.Thank you for fine videos like these."
5,7th Heaven,My daughter has collected this whole series. She can't wait for season 11 to come out. The whole family really enjoys watching this time and time again.
5,Prompt service! Good transaction!,"Bought as a gift...she had it on her ""list!"" Because of the prompt shipping, she got it in time for her party!"
4,Love 7th Heaven,"It's cheesy! There is a lot of overacting. The twins are terrible (someone get this kids some acting lessons!), but its 7th Heaven! Like a train wreck, you can't help but to watch, so if you are a fan, dive right into this last season of air time on the WB."
2,7th heaven,seems like the show is nothingmore about the camdon kids sleeping with someone. they should of stopped about the 7 or 8 season
5,This book will change your life,"No More Sheets is a powerful book. It will change your life. Ms.Bynum talks frankly about [stuff] and doesn't sugar coat anything. She's been where her readers are and was rescued. No More Sheets is for the young girl, the 30 something single and yes, even the married woman."
2,repeat of the first one,"I really was not impressed with ""starting over"" in fact I was a little disappointed. There is a sense of untruths in some her words I can't explain it. I just was really bored with this. Sorry:("
5,Prepare to walk FREE!,"I read this book in 2001 after being pulled out of a relationship of 5 yrs that was filled with lust and sexual soul ties.I also passed the book along to about 3 or 4 friends who were seeking the Lord around that time and they too were tremendously blessed and set free!!The No More Sheets tape has 'nothing' on this book. She is frank, candid, anointed and mandated to give a Word that will 'set the captive free'.It is a tremendous blessing and a source of deliverance!!!The revelation knowledge that she writes in this book along with her personal testimonies gave the reader the HUNGER to want to follow Christ in every sense of the term.She deals with masturbation, the homosexual, what we do in the spirit realm we when engage in relations outside the marriage covenant. She not only preaches and teaches the Word of God but she gives you steps to help you walk in deliverance and not fall into the tricks of the enemy!I often re-visit this book for reminders and a powerful RHEMA word!"
4,Definitely Truth,I bought this book for a person I was mentoring. She was struggling with promiscuity and I believe this book is good for any single Christian who is seeking the truth about past and present sexual encounters. Good insight into the conduct of single Christians and God's expectations of them. Great for single women Bible study.
5,The Best Breaking Free Message,This is one of the most amazing and real life in your face messages ever! Juanita Bynum's no holds bar tell all message is worth every penny!
3,"compelling, but disappointing","I saw Juanita Bynum preach on television, and I was very impressed by her. I was hoping that this book would help me change my life. Everything she said was true, but She seemed a bit over the top at times. I was a good book, but from it's description, the other reviews and the introduction, I was expecting some great, holy epiphany. I am sorry to say it has not been of much use to me."
5,It's About Time,"Thank God that someone had the courage to stand up and tell it like it is. I attended the Single's Conference in Dallas when Prophetess Bynum first delivered this message. It was truly a turning point in my life. Many of us have made some bad choices in relationships in the past but thank God there is deliverance! God loves his sons and daughters and wants nothing but the best for us--he wants us to experience ""wholeness through holiness"". Thanks Juanita for being obedient to the Spirit of the Lord..."
5,I love this book. Very revealing.,I enjoyed this book so much and it was a great help to me. I think it was a very brave thing for Juanita Bynum to reveal her life experiences to everyone like that. But I suppose it was necessary for her to get her story over to the public to let people know that change is so very possible for anyone in spite of what you've been through. It's time to throw off the old man and embrace the new you in Christ. Thank you Prophetess Bynum and may God continue to bless you always.
4,A Promising Start,A good start to a trilogy about Han Solo. The character is defined in a wonderful new way. Better than most Star Wars books. Great for any Star Wars or adventure fan.
5,"Almost, but not quite, as good as the Daley books.","I'll make this short. If you like Star Wars and you like Han Solo, read the book. Crispin does a great job of showing Solo's early years, and what turned him into the hard-edged type he was in the movies. The story is interesting, and the characterization dead-on. The main problem is that, due to how Han's past has been written by a half-dozen other people, her attempts at making this story fit with all the other histories seem more than a little forced. But that's only a minor gripe, as these are almost as much fun to read as Daley's excellent trilogy of Han books"
3,This was the best they could do?,"Given that all the Star Wars novels fall into the ""light reading"" category, throughout this book I kept thinking ""Han Solo's early life, and this is the best they could do?"" Han Solo is obviously the most complex of the main Star Wars characters, so I guess I expected a little more from this series. I have read that the author was limited by LucasArts as to what she could and could not write about, but still... Note to anyone who reads this review: I am an adult (unlike most of the other reviewers, apparently) and I have actually read books not from the Star Wars series."
5,Great Book,A.C. Crispin is a wonderful author and this book is another great work. A.C. Crispin has this great talent for making environments and characters come to life. It was nice to read the back story of one of my favorite SW characters. I'm looking forward to diving into THE HUTT GAMBIT.
4,"Good, not great, but good...","This book gave an excellent depiction of Han Solo in his early days and had some interesting characters, but didn't have that great of a plot. It was very fast paced, though, and definately captured the atmosphere of the movies. Hope her next one's as good! -Embe"
5,A great book!!,A wonderfully well writen book that takes us back to before Han was a gallaxy renowned smuggler. This book show us a young Han trying to get into the Impirial Acadamy. A great book. BUY IT!
2,I'll be concise,Here's the deal this book is at best worth a 2-1/2 star rating. The writing is simple but not captivating. Don't expect to be drawn in by any amazing character development in this sci-fi adventure novel. There are no real original twists or turns. I feel overall this story is nothing new for the sci-fi world. Those of you giving this book 4-5 stars could only hold this book to such high esteem due to its star wars roots. If this were a book not titled star wars the rating would be much lower trust me.Final thoughts: If you're a star wars fan you'll enjoy this one especially if you're a less mature reader. If you're looking for a good Star wars book check out anything written by Timothy Zahn (the man an artist to say the least). If your not a star wars fan forget about this one I know I will..
4,Good book,Wonderful book very creative It has a good start with action and tells you of Little Han Solo's past and when he yelled at the droid Amazingly funny If you have read other books with han in them you'll see why
4,A good addition to the Star Wars Series,"This is alot different than any other star wars books. There are new and good characters like muurgh Han's new friend and Bria Han's girlfriend. This book is very well detailed and has a good story of Han's life. Overall this a good book, but is boring at times. A good read."
2,Important tip for new Star Wars authors...,"For some reason the author feels like she has to prove that this character is the Han Solo! She keeps making references to Han not wanting to look scruffy, just because in ""The Empire"" there was one tiny reference to Han being mock-offended by being called scruffy by Leia. I mean from the time Han was six years old when the book starts, he keeps being concerned about his appearance because he doesn't want to look scruffy.And that's just one example. I also feel like if you took any sentence that Han ever said in any of the movies, chances are, you would find that exact same sentence in this trilogy. For example: ""I have a bad feeling about this."" That sentence was used once in Star Wars, but in this first book in the Han Solo trilogy it has already been used about a dozen times."
3,not my Han Solo,"This book, though midly entertaining, is not for the old school Star Wars fans that grew up on the original Trilogy. The Han Solo Trilogy lacks the stories of a scoundrel that I expected. This trilogy also has glaring contradictions and plot holes when taken with the movies and other Star Wars books. This book is for the younger Star Wars fan, the generation that believes Greedo shot first."
5,YES!!! The most wonderful book ever!,"A.C. Crispin has definitely saved the world of Star Wars books after Hambly's embarrassing text she calls 'novels'. Crispin captures the personality of Han Solo in this book that is beyond words. The characters are well developed, and I loved the character Bria, Han's love interest in this Trilogy. If you love a good adventure and you love Han, GO BUY THIS BOOK!!!! It's worth it!!"
3,Good reading -- for a Star Wars novel,"The disclaimer says it all -- due to the Lucasfilm constraints, or the endless need to milk the Star Wars cash cow for all it's worth, most Star Wars novels are absolutely wretched. The Han Solo trilogy is better than that; the plot is original and entertaining, and some very interesting ideas about Solo's past are brought up. Unfortunately, the execution remains simplistic, and the writing style is mediocre at best. Although I hoped for more, I did enjoy the read."
4,Han's has a fantastic begining !!!,"This is a great book, SW fans wll enjoy it to the fullest.I like how the author had the flashbacks of Han's life whih I thoght was an interesting style I also liked Han's relationship between Dewlanda his wookie friend.I thought his escape was quite good for a 17 year old.A lot of interesting things happen on Ylesia. I liked the scence of when Han lands on Alderaan Leia's home planet.Another important detail is Han's relationship with th slave Bria Tharen. They have one bumpy ride on there way out. Murrghh is also one tough Togorian he's Han's personnal bodygaurd as a pilot on Ylesia."
3,"Good book, but not great","The Paradise Snare is great if you are interested in finding out the background of Han Solo. Outside of that, it's pretty average science fiction. The story moves along well, and keeps you interested, but it doesn't really stand out from a lot of other science fiction. If you want to find out how Han got his start, I'd recommend this, otherwise, there are some better science fiction novels out there."
3,A good start to a trilogy,"This is only by second book I've read of the Star Wars Universe, the other was Rogue Plant (which was a good read). I wanted to read more about Han Solo after seeing the epic films and have only just recently started looking for them in the bookshops. I was amazed to find so many Star Wars books and didn't know where to start. So, I thought Han Solo Trilogy would be a good as any, since he was the best character out of the films, him and Bobba Fett. Back to the book, it is very well written, I couldn't put the book down, I just needed to find out what happened next. Obviously, you realise that Han isn't going to die, and that he ends up with Leia, but that doesn't stop you from turning the page. I'm just looking forward to reading Book 2 Hutt Gambit and then Book 3 Rebel Dawn, can't wait till I get home and start reading them."
4,"A fun, easy read","On its own merits ""The Paradise Snare"" is average fiction. It's a very easy read that I was able to cruise through in just a few sittings. It doesn't get hung up with flowery language or ""big words"". This works to its benefit as it's a very fast read and gives us great insight into Han Solo's earlier years. You can see where the author is going with Solo and how he initially starts the novel a naive (compared to the mature solo; he's still sharper than the average 17 year old), sensitive (Solo cries throughout the first chapter) young man and by the final chapters he's well on his way to the arrogant sarcastic scoundrel we all love.I recommend it to any Star Wars fan, in fact I'm in the middle of ""Hut Gambit"" book two in the series (equally as good, if not better so far), however for those with little interest in the greatest space opera of all time, the book lacks the depth and sophistication of better written sci-fi."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"This is the best Star Wars book I've ever read. Considering that there are over 25 Star Wars books, and I've read every single one, that's a really good review.It's good in every single way. We're learning about Han's mysterious past, and we're learning about all the things that happened to him to make him the guy that we see in the movies. The author is very good at illustrating the action, and the romance, and the emotion of it all. This book is something everyone should read. They can read it before or after they see the movies, but everyone's got to see it."
5,greatest rock home video ever,"When i bought this video the day it came out in '94, i was under the impression it was going to be the MTV unplugged performance. it wasn't, but i was blown away by this awesome video. it's like being a nirvana insider, you're right there, not nine million miles away. you're on the stage, you're in the dressing room. you're hanging out with the band. what a wonderful gift this is from kurt and the band. priceless."
3,OK,I was a little disappointed in the video quality of most of these performances..I'm guessing they were almost bootlegs in a sense.
5,NIRVANA ROCKS,Well the Video is Awsome and I have watched it 500 times because Nirvana is the greatest band ever and this video show's off their talent. When I watched it the first time it was a shock because I just had to watch it again and again P.S Doesn't Geffen and MTV need to release more Nirvana stuff for the hard core Nirvana fans like us I mean bootlegs are great but most of the time they are low quality. BUY THIS VIDEO NOW!!!
5,Excellent Video!!!,"This video is great! It features live versions of Lithium, Smells Like Teen Spirit, On a Plain, and many others!! It also includes many rare interviews with Kurt and the band. Definitley a great video for any Nirvana fan!"
5,nirvana lives on live,"this is the one of the the best videos i've ever seen for this reasons:1 the songs. I love about a girl and endless nameless shown on this, the rest are of course just of good.2. the side shows, i feel like its an old home movie, it shows them act the way they are on krist's little hand held. And 3. the replay value, i find myself whaching it time and time over again(i bought it a year ago). So in other words, BUY IT!"
3,It's okay,I ordered it for a Christmas gift. I was kinda disappointed that it wasn't one concert. It's more of a documentary. Maybe I didn't read the description good enough.
2,"NIRVANA rocks, but this DVD doesn't","I bought this just to be disappointed - this is not a concert DVD. As a concert DVD ""Unplugged"" in New York by MTV is much better. Best thing in this DVD is the Extras - where you actually get to watch Nirvana in action without much editing. But that's like 6 songs or so. If you want very short documentary and some Cobain interviews - then this will suffice, but if you want a pure concert without silly editing - wait until better concert DVDs will be released."
5,Amazing...............,"If you are a fan of Nirvana's or just like good music this video is a must. I am a HUGE Kurt Cobain fan and everything I had bought didn't seem to do justice for Kurt, Dave and Kris, but this did. You have to get this video.R.I.P Kurt2-20-674-8-94"
1,worse image quality!!,"songs are good, but image quality is the worse!! i think my cellphone can get a better recording picture than this!!"
3,Where is the DVD!,Great video but no DVD. The only way I will by this is if it comes out on DVD. So would lots of people.
3,Where's the DVD?,"Courtney Love is why Kurt is dead today. He wouldn't have killed himself if he wasn't married to such a disappoint to human life. Where's the DVD? The only reason this got a somewhat low review is because this would sound better with DVD audio. Courtney is suing Nirvana/Geffen/Interscope for more rights to Kurt's music. So it looks like we'll have to wait a while for all the cool stuff to get released and the stuff already out there (ie this video) to get re-released. One complaint I've heard about this video is that they cut out some of the songs. I hope a special edition DVD is on the horizion somewhere, or will Courtney stop that (like the 10 year aniverary box set with new songs)?"
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT LESS,I didn't like this cd at all! It didn't fit together very well and you can tell she has trouble singing those very long and high notes because she sounds like a rat squeaking or something! I wouldn't buy this if I were you! It's awful and after a while her singing started to hurt my ears!
1,STOP!,"Stop trying to be like everyone else! You are NOT Mariah Carey! Why do you ridicule yourself by copying her high note tecquines? I mean come on! You dont even sing high! Stop witch, just go away!"
5,Christina is totally awsome!,Christina Aguilera is a totally awsome singer. She is not fake like some. I think a lot of young women can respect her because sings about girls getting respect!
2,Ancient though,anyone who tries to undersrand the Greek philosophy and beliefs without knowing the reality of the Mystical rites cannot understand anything about Ancient Greece and if they do know then they try to downgrade everything.
3,Greek and Indian Philosophy,Reads like a long college term paper. Not a book for the uninitia It‘s meant to trace an old connection between Greek and Indian philosophy.
2,Bryant Filter NOT !!!,"Beware, This is not a Bryant OEM filter. The description is very mis leading. This is an aftermarket filter. This filter barely fit into the housing. I will not purchase in future."
2,i dont want to sleep tonight,"I'm a children's librarian and bought this book to use at storytime because of the positive review it got. I knew the book would be too fragile to check out to patrons, but planned to keep This book is so shoddily constructed that the last page ripped the first time I flipped through it the pop up on the last page tore."
1,I Don't Want to Sleep Tonight,"Not only did I stumble over the text in this poem(?), but it gave my 5 1/2 year old nightmares. Why give children more places to think they see a monster? I concentrated more on finding the flaps than the reading content until we got to the end. The I realized it wasn't the story I had intended to send my son off to dreamland with!"
2,Another book for kids because pseudo media had a few!,"Ok, so big news reader became a mommy and now we get stuck with over priced books that do little except get pseudo authors back on the Today Show. First we have to put up with Marie Shriver morgue book on death and now an inflated book on kids who can't sleep. The book is not worth the price nor content. These media types just can't stand not having attention so they live life through their kids and have to tell everyone about it. the book and books of this type are just hype. Wait two months it will be marked down to a bick where it should be and then it is worth buying."
2,Terrible writing style,"I hated the writing style. The train of thought frequently de-rails. You sometimes don't know you're reading a reverie/inner-thought/flashback until later. By then you're already confused. You ask yourself Did that JUST happen, or was that a flashback/reverie/inner-thought? I frequently had to read paragraphs twice."
1,Couldn't Get Into It,"While the first 20 or so pages of Loraine Adams' ""Harbor"" had me on the edge of my easy chair, the story seemed to ramble after that and I found it harder and harder to pick up the book. At the start we are enthralled by the story of Aziz, an Algerian illegal immigrant, as he leaps off the boat he stowed away on and swims to the Boston harbor. The tale of his first few days is compelling...after that it seems a miasma of a story of living with characters that we can't really care about. For me, the promise of the beginning was not fulfilled."
2,Blindsided,"Perhaps it's my age - sixties - but I found this book excessively violent and crude. Many horrendous details were surely not required to give us a ""true"" account of the characters' inner lives. I recoiled from the killing by shovel, for example, narrated with gruesome precision. Have we come to this? Am I the only one repelled by such literal trash talk? Is it a form of art or sophistication to think up new ways to write dirty? Are we all so coarsened as to not even comment on the extremes gone to by this author? My copy is in the garbage, as I could not bring myself to donate it to my local public library."
2,Eh.,"This book was difficult to get through - or at least to finish. With such a well written first half it was a shame to see it falter and stutter to its finish (where it sank). Adams seems to have great control of the story of Arab immigrants having a difficult go of life in the U.S., but as soon as the story begins to progress you notice that what you're reading has evolved into an Op Ed piece of sorts.The characters become two dimensional in their actions; and as a reader, I had to read back from the beginning to see if they were fully fleshed out in the first place, (sorry to say they were not). Add bad plotting and shoddy narration and a great story just can't be sustained.Such a shame, this book had such potential."
4,Not a bad start...,"An excellent first novel, but not without its problems. I wanted the pace to slow down at times. I had a hard time figuring out the relationships between characters as they were being introduced. Too bad, as the characters are really entertaining. I laughed out loud during several parts of dialog where Ms. Adam's shows brilliant insight into male thinking. I just felt the story never really came together together in the end. Despite all of that I am still giving this book 4 stars for sheer accomplishment."
3,Exciting start but wanes towards the end,"This is a relatively well-written novel about the experiences of an illegal immigrant. You will be enlightened about immigrants and some of their problems/common experiences. The US being a country built historically by immigrants, it is interesting to see how it works now. The first few chapters are great, thrilling and hard to put down. However, the author fails to keep the interest alive towards the end. The novel wanders and then with some plots about terrorists, FBI and so on got boring for me. I started skimming pages trying to finish it quicker."
4,Interesting,"Throughout this book, I kept waiting for more. More action, more answers, etc. By the end, I knew what was coming and found it a little disappointing. However, I did like the writing and the way the details added up to the inevitible conclusion. Certainly better than average, but not the greatest book I've read all year."
3,"Informative, but didn't engage me","I struggled with this book. Not because it was poorly written. I found the writing very good, the descriptions of the people and places very vivid. None of the characters really leaped out for me though. I could never really get excited about their issues and I was never that interested in what happened next in their lives. I felt like I was reading a journalistic piece rather than fiction. I realize the book is based on reality, but still. If it's fiction, it should have some sense of narrative that pulls me in and makes me want to continue."
3,Meandering,"While the book kept my interest throughout, when I finished reading the last page I closed the book feeling disappointed. There did not seem to be any sort of closure. I also found the portrayal of the non-Algerian characters as unbelievable and flat -- especially how most any woman that was spoken to in a kind, respectful manner ended up having sex with the male in short order. So while I found the cultural depictions of the Algerians interesting, I can't help but wonder how accurate that portrayal was given that of the Caucasians in the novel. I was also disappointed in the appearance of the worn-out 9/11 / terrorist theme -- it was an interesting/relevant literary device six years ago but it IMHO it has now been overused."
4,Great read,"Entertainment Weekly rightly pegged this as a book to engage. Lorraine Adams has composed a compelling but haunting tale of immigration to the U.S. But this isn't immigration from the south (i.e. Mexico). It's immigration from Algeria into a post 9-11 United States.Adams' story reveals a dark underbelly of American life that we probably brush up against on a regular basis but fail to see. She does this by focusing on several Algerian immigrants. Though the story is ""inspired"" by real stories, it's hard to say how to respond to the text. Is the story true enough to reality to compel engagement with the forces of immigration? Hard to say, but Adams has successfully muddied the waters."
3,An overambitious yet impressive accomplishment ...,"This book, with its great scope and complicated objectives, could not help but fall short in some aspects. Some of his historical analogies (the Grey/Agassiz conflict and the civil war) are a bit of a stretch, and the information on nearly all the scientists leaves the reader wanting. Nonetheless, this book covers an extremely broad range of topics, people...the type above the title says it all--""From Meriwether Lewis to Alfred Kinsey"". This is obviously not going to be extremely in depth on many subjects. The chapter on biology's integration into the high schools is by far the best section of the book. A book that fulfills a specific niche admirably if not terribly enthrallingly."
2,Ok general reading,This volume is interesting but it tries to cover too much. The author also makes too many unsupported claims and over-generalizations.An ok introduction to the complex topics in this field.
5,A fan of France - Friday 6th August 1999,"Yes, for me C.Cross is the sun, the sea, California. this CD with Michael Mac Donald, Larry Carlton, Valerie Carter is great."
1,"Sailing, take me away, to where I can heave over the side","This thing can not sing,someone kidnapped his manhood,total seasickness."
5,Can't go wrong with a debut like this,"A 1979 debut album that garnered four Grammys in 1980 must have a place in your CD collection. His style is soft rock, perhaps a bit on the ""folk rock"" side, smooth voice, simple and unpretentious lyrics. Although there are only nine tracks, all are quality work and the album flows well from beginning to end. Add to that the fact that four of these were major hits (""Sailing"", ""Say You'll Be Mine"", ""Ride Like The Wind"", ""Never Be The Same""), and satisfaction is guaranteed. This is not an album to try and extract ""deep meaning"" out of - rather sit back on a Sunday evening and enjoy the time as it goes ""Sailing"" by. Finally, if you are completely new to Christopher Cross, then I would definitely begin with this album. Go and get it."
5,Cool breeze that wash away our mind,"In Japan,this artist is compared to the famous singer ODA KAZUMASA.These two singers have one thing in common.They both have excellent,soothing,gentle voice given by GOD.You can hear polished adult oriented sound here and there.Refined melodies provided by CROSS lead you to the pleasant paradise like clouds floating in the sky.If you like BOZZ SCAGGS , you will like this too.This well-balanced vocal album is the peak of CHRISTOPHER CROSS."
5,Who's Christopher Cross?Everyone knew after the grammy's,"I remember seeing Barbra Streisand and Michael Jackson sitting in the audience waiting to receive a grammy for there huge hits,""Off the Wall""and ""Guilty,""but all you heard that night was Christopher Cross's name being called.This debut ablum was a huge hit.Four of the songs made the top 10.""Ride like the Wind"" was the first single released,but when ""Sailing"" came out,everyone wanted this new record.I happen to like Christopher Cross's next album just as much,even though it wasen't a hit like this record.I seen on amazon that Christopher has a new album out.I'm going to order this new CD.I miss this type of music."
2,too bulky,Too bulky to be any good as wallet holder. You have to work around it in your pocket to even get to your wallet.
4,"Great for corporate ID security card to get in the building, etc","I replaced the little belt loop clip and also the ring that connects to your card holder. With those adjustments, it is five star for swiping your corporate card to get in restricted access doors, etc. Light camping use also would be five stars. The heart of the unit is the spring loaded retractable wire thingy. Completely adequate for years of service as opposed to those chinsy plastic things they give you for free at the office (that never last..)."
4,Clara y serena,"Doña Alicia DeLarrocha, una de las grandes pianistas del Siglo XX, nos sorprende gratamente con su grabación de dos obras de Robert Schumann. Las interpretaciones de Doña Alicia están llenas de color e impecablemente bien ejecutadas, muy meticulosa en cada compás, ella toca con gran claridad y serenidad, indudablemente un gran disco. En la interpretación de Humoreske Op.20, encuentro tal vez mayor expresividad en Ashkenazy. En la Fantasía Op. 17, las versiones de Claudio Arrau o Sviatoslav Richter, son más Schumanianas (Apasionadas).Buen disco.Francisco J. Muñoz"
1,sell on the strenght of the sign,"this album is turd i don't care what anybody says, i dont know why the man can't rap how he did on ironman by ghost (maybe ghost was writing his lyrics back then). he now stutters garbage with no flow, might as well talk. the beats on this album are pathetic apart from decks beat on revenge. this is honestly the worst wu associated album, straight trash how the hell rza allowed this wack to come out id never know. don't get me wrong i love wu tang but this has gone too far, The wu sign does not mean quality anymore thanks to this!"
5,The Yin and the Yang,"I cannot believe how underrated this album, let alone this rapper, are... even amongst Wu-heads... I'm not sure what the reviewer who referred to them as ""Intelligent stuff only rich kids listen to"" was trying to claim-But they're obviously banannas.Wu is the sh*t, true Hip-Hop is the people's music, and Cappadonna's just keepin' it real in that tradition-I LOVE this record-Buy two copies,One for each hemisphere of your brain."
1,Terrible,"The worst effort the Wu has ever put forth. Cappa has been digressing gradually since his show-stealing verses on Ice Cream and Winter Warz. The Pillage was good, but only because of great production from the RZA, not because of the mc rocking the tracks. The Yin and the Yang is not blessed with that production. It is just Cappadonna making very little sense to radio friendly beats and rapping alongside the likes of Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat. No wonder he wasn't on Iron Flag."
1,what are you people smoking? Cappadona is horrible.,"ok, firstly, Cappadona is a horrible lyricist. It's sad to see a good group like Wu-Tang endorse a rapper with such weak rhymes. Secondly, if Cappadona's rhymes weren't bad enough, the production bored me half to death. This CD is just plain horrible."
1,...,"Why Wu-Tang change so much? Why they don't do anymore music Style like: Chef Raekwon: Only Built for Cuban Linx, Ghosthface: Ironman, Wu-Tang: Enter the 36th Chambers, Gza: Liquid Swords? I don't know, but what i know is this album is very disapointing, cappadonna can do better than that. I'm a big fan of Wu-Tang Clan, but i think that: The W and The Ying and the Yang were Major Disapointing. Well, I hope Ghosthface: Cuban Linx 2, Chef Raekwon: Cuban Linx 2, RZA: BobbyDigital 2, Wu-tang: THe WW2 are not going to be like this."
3,True To It's Title,"Its an appropiate name for the album. Half of it is good. The other is alright/bad. The Gritz, SuperModel, War Rats (originally to be named Star Wars), Love Is The Message, Bread Of life, Big Business, and Revenge are the good songs. We Know, Shake Dat, One Way 2 Zion, and the bonus track are either okay or trully bad. Definetely The Yin & Yang."
1,This is the worst thing I've ever heard ever period ever,"Typical wu.Man this is the worst thing ever. The only good track on this is the Da Brat/JD track which I got downloaded on my pc. And Cappadonna's even bad on his part. Some psycho kid I work with at work told me to check this album out, and I knew immediclately that it had to be that smart wu-tang intelligent [stuff] only rich people listen to. And I was wrong, this **** ain't smart at all. Infact, Cappadonndya's gotta be the worst rapper I ever heard. Don't buy this cd."
1,Wu keeps they're word?,Once again the Wu has let us down.The rza continues to contradict himself by not living up to what he says.This album is a major upset due to it's wack production and commercial content.The wu must stick to the styles that can be found on they're first album if they want to succeed.It's sad that the wu continues to dissapoint the fans by travelling in the wrong direction.If only the fans could somehow change the fate of the wu-tang clan...
1,wizzzy wack,"Horrible!! Horrible!! Horrible!! Jermaine Dupri on a wu tang album??? This albums gets half a star because of ""Supermodel"" and another half because the inspectah deck produced joint ""Revenge"" sound aight too, Other than that its pure garbage. Cappondonna is no longer considered a part of Wu-Tang Clan with this sellout release! Bye cappodonna, your Wu-Logo is offically sold and taken away!!!!"
4,Good Lord...,"Man, I was totally unprepared for what I was about to experience when I bought this. Instead of the breakneck speed we know and love them for, we have more of a doom and gloom sound here. Ghosts and hooded droids come to mind when hearing this album. I give this 4 stars because this album marked a transitional shift from death metal to unholy black metal that they're more famous for. Be sure to light candles in the dark and meditate while listening to this."
5,Should become a classic of gay literature,"Ronald L. Donaghe continues his &#65533;Common Threads in the Life&#65533; series with a novel that excels both as a family drama and as an action drama. Five years after the events of the novel Common Sons, Donaghe&#65533;s young lovers Tom and Joel decide to start a family. The struggles they face come from unexpected sources, keeping readers guessing at the next obstacles or solutions. Donaghe delivers what should become a classic of gay literature."
5,Breath-taking! But out-of-print.,"I read this book four years ago, and I was enthralled by its characters and situations. Connecting the stories of the martyrs made me think about the way it must have been. This book is an excellent read if you skip around the long chapters detailing the architecture and lifestyle of the catacombs."
4,Cooking with Herbs.,"This is an interesting and useful book for new recipes using fresh herbs. We are now expanding our own herb garden,"
4,"Excellent, no-nonsense compilation of results","This book is a gem, not so much for the results it contains, but for how it presents them. The authors introduce a compact notation centered on kronecker products and schur products. In addition they present a useful set of operators and identities for manipulating these objects. The result is a pleasing language for mathematical manipulation avoiding to a large extent the ""debauchery of indices"" that pose a problem in many investigations. This presentation makes the price of the book almost worthwhile. The review of the properties of matrices is compact and reasonably complete. The applications are straightforward and competently presented."
3,High waisted,"These were a bit high-waisted for my taste, so I gave them to my sister who liked them."
5,Shower Curtain,This came in just a few days and was perfect - I've been looking for this exact curtain for years and finally found it!
3,Compelling Coming of Age Story,"Once I picked up this book, I found it very difficult to put it down. The story is compelling and deeply moving. The events are detailed in an such eloquent way, yet the book smacks of realism the entire way through.Kudos to Brunswick for being brave enough to share this story with us!"
1,No Way to Treat a Reader,"Vulgar-filled story about a First Lady accused of assassinating her adulterous husband. Totally filled with morally repugnant characters that are extremely two-dimensional. The author is defined as a ""political humorist"", but there is very little humor in this effort."
3,No Way to Treat a First Lady: A Novel,Although this was entertaining in places and an very easy read it was no Carl Hiaasen. The verbal exchange between the main characters was creative but anyone with even a minor knowledge of the law would find the plot far from believeable.Not a bad read to throw in your beach bag or take to the cabin for some easy weekend reading but thats about it.
3,Good read - thats all.,"I have a general formula for awarding stars. Four for a good read that I would definitely recommned to others if asked. Five stars for those that make me want to grab people in the streets and say to them, ""Read this, or you will be missing something in your life!"" Two stars for those books I only read ten pages and find reason and excuses not to read further. One star for books that I read two pages and throw away.I give this book 3 stars, I read it even liked it in places but that is all. I would not recommend it to anyone else. Even while enjoying it, I kept thinking this is a waste of time.But then I enjoyed ""Thank you for smoking"" so very much and by reading this book feel that I am just paying my respects to the author who is capable of better."
3,Solid,"This novel is a parody of our media culture when it comes to high profile trials.In No Way To Treat a First Lady, the protagonist, the profoundly immoral defense attorney Bruce Baylor, defends the first lady of the US against charges that she killed her husband, the President. But his true motives for taking the case are in question, as they happened to be a couple back in law school. The cast also includes an airhead Marilyn Monroe type mega star named Babbette with whom it turns out the President was having an affair. Nick Naylor from Thank You For Smoking also makes a few cameo appearances. Many prominent media personalities also make appearances throughout the work, with thinly veiled name changes (i.e. Greta van Botox).Even when Buckley is not at his best, he is still a fun read."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"You read this book, and you keep waiting for it to get better. Not that it is bad, it is just not what his other books are - captivating. There are good parts to this book and some funny awkward moments, but it is almost like the book is trying to hard to be something that it is not - sharp satire. I know Buckley tries to be over the top but this time he was just, well.... over."
4,LOL Audio Book,"I recently laughed my way through the CD audio book edition of Buckley's roman a clef (more like a Roman toga party a clef) while driving some of the most stupefyingly dull stretches of the New York State Thruway. It preserved my sanity, kept me awake and in a keen state of anticipation for the next sharply goofy plot turn. Kudos to Tim Matheson for a fine telling of the story. His voice, intonation and strategic pauses were right on the money. A cautionary note: don't play this story when your kids are within earshot unless you like to feel embarrassed."
4,political satire at its funniest,"Political Satire is always a difficult genre to shine in. Too often have I found myself in the midst of a medicre, boring plot. Not so with ""No Way to Treat a First Lady"". The combination Political Satire/Thriller is not only laugh out loud funny, but goes far deeper than what's on the page.Buckley exploits our deep-seated cynicism for today's political leaders with a character base that is at once seriously funny and strangely familiar-- from the lecherous president to the assertive first lady (dubbed Lady Bethmac), to the lovably seedy lawyer, Boyce Baylor.Not only is this novel funny, but engaging; once started, it is difficult to put down. I found myself eager to find out--- was she *really* guilty of murder?To give away anymore would be to spoil a brilliant book."
4,A delightful satire,"A book that skewers lawyers, the media culture and the Washington power-elite. A delightful satire and fun read."
3,"Good, Entertaining Read","""No Way to Treat a First Lady"" is an amusing read for the few hours it will take you to finish it. This isn't literary fiction; you won't receive any interesting revelations about life and love.The heroine, Elizabeth Tyler MacMann, is accused of killing her husband, Kenneth Kemble MacMann, war hero and President of the United States. Boyce ""Shameless"" Baylor is her lawyer and jilted fiancé-she left him twenty-five years ago for the man who would become president. There are plenty of characters, including the actress/mistress/singer/Middle East peace advocate, a renegade spy, and underworld gangsters.Buckley pokes fun of the media, the government, the legal system, and the entertainment industry. With a few clever witticisms and improbable twists, the novel makes its way through the ""Trial of the Millennium"" until the all the plot threads tie up neatly in the end.I'd recommend ""No Way to Treat a First Lady"" for a few hours entertainment and not much else."
2,"Good plot outline, poorly executed","The plot outline is good, but it's poorly executed.Once the author thinks he has a funny idea, he repeats it several times since we weren't bright enough to get it the first time.The trial is out of order -- Buckley has the prosecution and defense call witnesses almost in random order. Judges would not need to recuse themselves because they were appointed by the victim's predecessor. The Perry Mason TV series didn't have ""trials,"" but preliminary hearings.The characters are largely one-dimensional, and the writing style is a bit silly.These might be overlooked, but in his Acknowledgements, Buckley claims he had the help of several ""distinguished attorneys,"" plus ""a peerless editor,"" and ""the keen eyes of Gregory Zorthian and William F. Buckley Jr.,"" AND a relentless and superb fact checker. In other words, Christopher Buckley had to work fairly hard to produce the merely-mediocre execution of what could have been a good book."
1,Dont use!!!,"I used this spray on my sons cat as regular preventive care. It was the first time that we had used this product and I found the smell to be very strong. After I sprayed him down he was drooling very badly, was very lethargic and couldn't seem to control his bladder. I consulted our vet who advised me to immediately wash him with Dawn dishsoap and next time to use any other product besides this one. He is still fighting for his life and we just have to wait and see if he survives. Please just get something else, it isn't worth the life of your pet."
3,"Works, but has a very strong fragrance","Okay...so my dog has fleas. I tried using powders on her, but they didn't go away. So, to make a 25.00 order ship free, I bought this spray. It kills the fleas pretty well. The only thing I don't care for is the smell of it. It smells nice...only if you spray a very little of it. Well, you have to spray a lot to make sure it penetrates the fur of the animal. After using it, I smelled like it, my dog definitely smelled like it, everything I touched smelled like it. I washed my hands with dish soap, and I still smelled like it. It is wise to use rubber gloves when using this product."
5,It Works!!!,This flee spray was used on a dog and it helps keep the flees off when she is outside and it doesn't smell too bad.
5,Memories/The Vogues Sing The Good Old Songs And Other Hits,"The Vogues' third Reprise album, 'Memories', was released in September 1969. The two singles from this album are 'Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine) which reached #7 AC and #42 Pop in 4/69, and 'Moments To Remember' which reached #17 AC in 5/69. Earth Angel is personal favorite of mine with a great Ernie Freeman arrangement and Hal Blaine's thundering toms. And we can't forget The Vogues' cover of 'Since I Don't Have You' which is GREAT!The Vogues fourth Reprise album, 'The Vogues Sing The Good Old Songs And Other Hits' was released in mid 1970.' Favorite tracks are 'Theme (The Good Old Songs Medley),'Easy To Say', 'I Know You As A Woman'."
3,A Sucker Born Every Minute?,"I love Los Panchos, I even love this CD, but...At $45 it is pretty steep and not an especially good value for the price. The sound quality of the CD is actually very good, but it's not so good that it warrants this kind of a price tag. There is a song book with the CD which is in Spanish and Japanese, which leads me to wonder if the steep cost is a result of being imported first into Mexico from Japan and then into the U.S. If you've got $45 to burn then by all means purchase this CD, you won't be disappointed. But for the same amount you can purchase at least 3 other Los Panchos CDs here on Amazon and get the same 18 songs plus even more. If this had been a $20 CD I would have rated it 5-stars because the gentle harmonies and guitars are as seductive as ever. This rating is based solely on the value for the price. And no, I'm not sorry I purchased it."
5,Great encouragement!,"This book by Elisabeth Elliot is an inspiration to live a more disciplined life. I gave it to my sister for her birthday and she is greatly enjoying reading it. I like how it's broken up into sections so that I can read a little bit each night before I go to bed, even if I'm not able to read an entire chapter."
5,Discipline: The Glad Surrender,"This is a really good book where Elisabeth Elliot draws from her own experience in surrendering to God. She speaks about how surrendering to discipline is something that will make life better rather than giving it all up. And like all of Elliot's books, it is incredibly well written."
1,return to mysterious island,I don't really care for point and click games as there too hard for me to play. i don't recomend it.
2,Not what I expected,"I found the game somewhat boring and hard to follow. It was frustrating not being able to do things with the multiple tools I had in my inventory. While this is not my type of game, people interested in assembling things and making ""experiments"" might enjoy it."
3,Pretty but painful,"These shoes are very pretty and looked great with my floor length, navy blue gown. However, after only a short time at the wedding reception, my feet were killing me. Forget about dancing in them -- kicked the shoes off and danced barefoot. Very little padding in them."
5,So happy to find this!,"I am thrilled to find this on CD. I had this album when I was a little girl and I have such fond memories of playing the record on my little record player and singing the songs with my mom and sister. The songs are so sweet and not typical ""kid music"" which I find annoying. I'm buying this CD now for my little girl and can't wait to get it!"
4,Family Favorite,"I first heard this as a tape when my daughter was quite young. Our whole family loved it, my daughter used to sing Jelly Man Kelly with my husband every night when he came home from work. It was a staple in the car, and as the years have gone on has become the tape we play every summer as we head off for vacation. It is known as the ""Avalon tape"" for Avalon, NJ,and always brings to mind carefree days at the beach. It is definitely music for the entire family."
5,In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record,Execllent - it is just what I wanted and would recommend to anyone who would be interested in this product.
2,"I wish this disc had a different version of the ""Jelly Man Kelly"" by James Taylor,(look it up on),it's the one from..","A Sesame Street clip. I have it on DVD but I wanted to own it on CD. The rest of the songs on this CD are sweet but not in my taste, so much by Carly Simon, so if she's one of your favs; go for it. I wished I saved the packaging so I could've returned it and got my money back, but such as life, I'll probably pass it on to a friend."
4,In Harmony,"I bought this for the Doobie Brothers song ""Wynken, Blyken and Nod, but the other songs are also good."
1,Yucky,"What an enormous disappointment. With the artists listed you would think it would be impossible for this to be a bad album. It is. The sound quality is terrible- it sounds like someone put a microphone next to a tape player, then transferred it to digital. It's annoying. To quote my 4 year old son: ""Mommy, can we listen to something else?"" I agreed."
2,disappointed,I was very surprised when I saw all of these great reviews. I was very disappointed when I received this album. I purchased this for my child and not for myself. I do not see how this would be for a child.
5,Caramel Pop,"I normally don't eat sugary treats, but when I saw this item, I just had to eat one to remember my childhood days of almost pulling my teeth out while trying to chew on this delicious milk caramel pop.The trick of this entire experience is to use this like a lollipop and get the caramel soft enough so you can actually bite off a piece and then suck on it slowly. If you try to chew this caramel, you will notice it sticks to your teeth with a level yet unknown to glue.So, use with caution. I will occasionally treat myself to one of these because they keep me busy while watching a movie. It also helps one get through 100s of pages of editing!I had no idea they still made these because I'd only seen the sugar daddy treats in packets, but had not seen the pops in quite some time. It was like I was 13 again.~The Rebecca Review"
3,"Truly a Scary Ghost Story,OR was it REEL !","The BRINKwww.thunderheadstudios.com/brinkA Ben Cooper filmStarring Rachel Balzer and Mitch TolesVery scary film, Great acting and just looked good.Any project that uses Thomas Edison in a horror plot, Hey, where could they go wrong.There is be-headings, Multiple drownings and some truly shocking scenes.Script was by John Bowker and Cooper.That Mitch Toles,He works a lot must be talented, Huh !I keep looking on Ebay for one of these Edison "" Talk To The Dead "" phones, No luck yet.The shocker could be ""HEY"",Was this like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead or James Cameron's Titanic ?"
1,It's Orajel Maximum Strength.,It's not 1.8 ounces as advertised though. It's .45 ounces. The box appeared to have been opened before and the item is expired as of 1/2012. Which wsa 2 months ago. Bad deal.
1,"Not fitted, cheap",Cheaply made; not fitted. Go with a Body Glove or O'Neill brand instead of the Beach Depot.
1,Runs small,"I bought this product on the advice of a friend who lives on a boat in the Caribbean who wears a rash guard year round. I bought the both a medium and a large as I am a women's size 10. The picture is accurate. You can see your lingerie through the shirt, and fits up to the base of your neck. I couldn't get into the medium. The large runs small and I found it hot. She likes them. I returned it."
5,Wonderful for baby!,"We received this as a baby gift and it has been a godsend. Our newborn relaxes to the sound of this when nothing else works. We also love it for ourselves; the CD contains the best of Bach's less fiery works, and the musical interpretation and recording quality are outstanding."
2,Not his best effort,"I didn't fall in love with this effort by Jobim. The orchestral arrangements are a tad cliche and more than a tad predictable. The mix is off throughout much of the album and jobim's tired scatting gets swallowed up in the constant over-dramatized string crescendos. Between the bad mix, cliche arrangements, and raspy and unenthusiastic scat lines, the whole thing comes off sounding like an experiment with a karaoke machine."
1,Buy another album from Jobim,"The problem with this album is that the songs are not sung in Portuguese and Jobim himself is singing them. Jobim is the best composer of popular music in this century, and he deserves a world class interpretation. There are superior vocal albums with Elis Regina (best), Astrud (cute), and Joao Gilberto singing. Or you can try the mostly instrumental versions such as Wave, Tide, or Stone Flower. The rating is based on the better available alternatives."
2,it works better than nothing,"There is no easier way to store CDs, in my opinion, than inside good weight smooth paperboard also known as fiberboard but 5 X 5 inches is not wide enough; it scrapes the sides of the CD's playing surface going in and out, and the top gaps open so dust etc can enter. I bought some 5 1/8 by 5 1/8 inch very smooth, inside and out, like with a sheen that repels dirt and (crucial!) the edge where the CD is inserted has no roughness, no roughness at all. Now where did I get these sleeves? That's the question. Been using and reusing them for years. But these? Maybe to give with a CD or DVD enclosed to someone who will then download CD and toss the cover. But no use if needed for regular storage. The first sleeve I bought scratched the first CD I put in it the very first time. All those firsts added up to one big last time I buy this size!"
2,Tough Call,"This book frustrated me. The heroine, Emma, is constantly jumping to negative conclusions about the hero, even though she is represented as a level-headed person not given to listening to gossip. She is constantly scolding him for imagined faults and I honestly couldn't read a few of the conversations between them, because she looks so rude and foolish. I couldn't imagine what he saw in her.To be fair, he does seem awfully coarse in the first chapter, but this is completely at odds with his character throughout the rest of the book and with his apparently chivalrous nature.It is one of the old-fashioned style novels in which there is misunderstanding and tension until three pages from the end of the book when suddenly new information is revealed, declarations are made and all is well."
4,works great,"I wasn't expecting much for the cheap price I paid for this, but after a year the charger and batteries are still working great!"
2,worked great for a while,"bought these about 20 months ago. Batteries were great for first few dozen recharges, now 2 of the 6 won't charge and 2 run down very quickly (about 30% life of when new) and the other two last about 50% original. Even new they didn't last near as long as say a non-rechargeable Duracell.Going to try a different brand next time around, but at the time these were the best deal and I got my monies worth."
3,Student Review,"Being grad student, I was required to purchase this book. It has some good points, but is a bit complicated and unclear at times. I will say that Roberts and Turgeon offer various viewpoints on the impact of language."
4,Carly's Punk Rock Album,"In 1980,everyone had a Punk Rock Album,this was Carly's. When I first heard,""Come up Stairs"",it got me rocking. And who said Madonna had x-rated songs.Just play,""The three of us in the Dark"" I was on stage with Carly at the Stanley theater in Pittsburgh when She was touring with this Album. She asked if some of us would come up on Stage with her to help with her fright of singing in front of people. The first song was,""Come upstairs"" and She ended with "" Body and Soul"" from Tourch. It was the greatest night for me,but the worst for Carly,but she came back like a Lion in the late 80's.This album finally came out on CD last year,and I cherish it with all my other Carly CD's."
5,"Carly Should Be Singing ""Come Upstairs I Got Some Percodan!!!""","As with ALL of Ms. Simon's albums her songs consist of her usual egocentric self absobed musings. The track ""The Three Of us In The Dark' refers to a threesome which may have included Mr. James Taylor, herself and a bottle of Percodan but I have yet to figure out how you are supossed to open the bottle in the dark(!!!) and from what I have read most people like threesomes with the lights on. Most of the tracks on this album are banal and unforgettable and as always Ms. Simon sings about just how great she thinks she is in bed which has become RATHER TIRING after 30 years. I give this album 5 stars because for once her male fans won't buy this album for the cover alone."
3,memories are memories,"I had this CD when it first came out in 1980. The single ""Jessie"" received major airplay in Australia and I was hooked. For a singer/songer write of the time Simon found an edgier sound using electric guitars and synthesizers. The album at the time stood very well on its own but for me listening to it 30 years later I can reflect that it is not as solid as my memories."
2,GNARLY CARLY,"As a long-time Carly Simon fan, I have to wonder what she was thinking when recording COME UPSTAIRS. Wanting to explore the ""punk rock"" and 80s synth-rock scenes is no crime, but her selection of songs is erratic and her vocals are really disappointing, especially her imitation of Janis Joplin on the interminably long IN PAIN. THEM sounds like a Devo reject and THE DESERT rips off her own ""Memorial Day"" from her far superior SPY.Her big hit, JESSE, is passable but nowhere near the quality of previous or future singles. COME UPSTAIRS is an engaging opener, but there are no real WOW moments.Producer Mike Manieri should've examined the material more carefully. COME UPSTAIRS is a pothole in a usually smooth road."
5,Entertaining,"The book has been written in many subjects, which would appeal to a large reading audience. The author myself, has put a great deal of thought into my work, in order to write poetry as I wish it to be.I feel this book gives a new meaning to poetry, because it has to be presented in words, that are pronounced or read for the very first time.Words have to sound good and of course the reader wants to be entertained. But I also feel the reader must judge for him or herself, and in doing so, find my work very different from other writers of Poetry.Thank you. Peter Finch"
5,Stunning,"I chanced on this CD, thank goodness I did, an absolutely superb set of soulful Texas blues.I can't wait for their latest to come out shortlyVoodoo Moon"
4,"Purist Cycler, not a writer","Voiland is a purist; the book tracks his journey into cycling and his trek through the 48 continuous states. Road stories and advice is intersparced with philosophy and humor. It is essentially travel journal made into book form. Contains valuable information for a perspective tourist, and is endearing in it's sincerity."
5,fantastic book,"Has anybody noticed the goats on page 64? Are these domistic goats, or a wild goat no longer with us?"
3,entertainment,the flows are spectangular. he is multifluxuatin with rambunctious allusions clashing with intense metaphorical contra. ya know! track number 3 will amaze all the listeners.he pulls of sentences that not the most creative rapper could invent.
2,World Class Reliability by Bhote,"If you are looking for a text with an technical aspect with regards to Reliability this is NOT the book to get! I've read Bhote's book on ""World Class Quality"", and found that to be informative, but it is apparent that his knowledge in Reliability may not extend far beyond his 'opinions'..."
2,Sorry to write...,"I bought this book based on my opinion on ""World Class Quality: Using Design of Experiments to Make It Happen"". There is something about MEOST, so I wanted to go deeper. Unfortunately ""World Class Reliability"" does not add anything to ""WCQ"".Up to page 155 (out of 208) there is only bla, bla, bla. Chapter 10 (35 pages) gives you the same info about MEOST that in ""WCQ"". Some additional information about chosing the MEOST equipment you will find in appendix.I bought this book with expectations to find many examples. There are very, very few! Furthermore there is no expamle from begging to the end (from problem through MEOST, corrective actions, B vs. C - validation of corrective actions). Just to add up - in those examples that you can find you will find... mistakes!Sorry to say - waste of money and time!PSWrite MEOST and strees in Google and you will find the same information in pdf or ppt files for free in the net!"
5,Good,"Ok, but has written better. Very unusual, because his books are always read. Maybe I'll take another look. 2 more words."
3,ok,"Not the best read, but very good anyway. I would read more by this author. Enough said. No more comments'"
5,As good as the first,This the second book in the series and I found it as good if not better than the first. The characters are alive and jumps off the pages.
2,kill all the lawyers,I wasn't too happy with the premise of the book. Some one wants to kill a shyster lawyer. Maybe they should.
3,He could have been less canned,This book had the potential of being a 4 or 5 star. The author can grab and hold your interest even when the foreshadowing has given away much of the plot. Where the author hurts the book is when he interjects canned political remarks into his protagonist's personality only for the sake of throwing barbs. Many of the other devices show originality. It strongly detracts from the character and distracts the reader. There would be far better ways to play potential for his undertones of interfaith friction.
2,didn't like,"Could not get into this book, the characters were unbelievable. Not my type of humour, if that is what it was. Unfortunately not one of my successful choices."
2,A Waste of Time,The characters have become stale and the story line trite. Much of the dialog which is intended to be witty falls flat.
2,kill all the lawyers,Easy to read and the story line was okay but did not like the personality of the characters. Especially the main character. It did keep my interest as to how it would end.
5,The new John D. McDonald..,I was pleased. I can understand why Levine won the McDonald award. Great read. Looking forward to reading more books in the Soloman vs.Lord series.
4,Kill All The Lawyers-(Solomon vs Lord) Paul Levine,"I gave this book 4 stars!! I have read several of Solomon vs Lord books and have enjoyed most of them!!Paul Levine is a good author. Whenever I see a book he has written,I purchase it.I am very pleased with what I have read so far.I suggest you read this book and make your own comments."
3,Kill All The Lawyers,"This book continues the rocky romance of Simon and Lord, gives Victoria's mother more credibility as a ""real"" person, and provides interesting ""brain phenomena"" for Bobby, Simon's nephew.The plot is rather weak, and the reader identifies the villain almost immediately. There are no twists and turns to keep the audience reading.Good for a quick bit of light entertainment."
3,Too much like the Jake Lassiter series,"This was the first book in the ""Soloman vs. Lord"" series that I have read. I hope the others have more for Victoria Lord to do in them. Until the end of the book she was just irritating window dressing. There was more of a relationship between Steve Soloman and his antagonist ""Dr. Bill"". That's where the meat of the story exists. I do find Steve Soloman to be sort of a redressed Jake Lassiter from Paul Levine's other series. The characters are too much alike. Still it was an enjoyable read. I like the relationship between Steve and his young nephew that lives with him more than I like his girlfriend. I just feel her character is too cold.I will probably read more in this series. I like Mr. Levine's writing. It is enjoyable and entertaining. He seems to have a sense of humor that shows through in his books."
3,Great Title!,"I was so looking forward to reading this, since the previous two in the series were enjoyable. Maybe it was just me this time, but the bad guy being a pedophile could not make me laugh - at all. Murder apparently doesn't bother me, but this vile act does. Also, the bickering between Solomon and Lord got a bit tired for me. The jokes and t-shirts are still worth it and maybe I just don't want to see Bobby grow up? If there is another in the series, I will for sure read it with fingers crossed."
3,A Little Disapointed,Paul Levines wonderful dialogue still holds up in this book but the story fell a little flat in comparison to his other books in series. The secondary characters also seem to be changing their spots. The Judge seems to be losing his edge as is Victoria's mom. They are wildly off-center characters & he has given them a sort of normality that does't seem to fit with their personalities. Unless he plans on having them become senile in his next book. The indecision between Solomon & Lord is getting a little stale as are the ethnic jokes. The marlin is brilliant but plot seems implausable. Loved his other books in series but this one misses the mark.
5,Totally fell in love with Paul Levine's books!,"I'm new at thrillers and I think I just discovered the most amazing writer. I bought 4 of Paul Levine's books so far, ""Kill all the lawyers"" was my very first, and I intend on buying them all. Excuse my poor English, English being my second language."
4,not a bad read,My first Paul Levine novel turned out to be a pleasant experience. Nothing too heavy but enough action to keep the story moving. The main characters were likable and easy to get to know. The bad guys were easy to dislike and unsympathetic. I'm sure I will be joining the Soloman and Lord lawfrm in another adventure soon and recommend that you do too.
4,A Killer Book,"Enjoyable, fast read about Soloman and Lord. Soloman gets himself in trouble again with his unorthodox interaction between clients and himself."
4,Kill All the Lawyers,I have read several Solomon vs. Lord books and I like the type of humor exhibited by the conversations between the two characters. I plan on reading some more to see how the author builds the relationship. The books are a good quick read.
5,Better than Good,"As usual, I wasn't disappointed by Paul Levine. I can't wait for his next Solomon v. Lord book to be published, so I stared reading his earlier Jake Lassiter novels. Very entertaining!"
2,KILL ALL THE LAWYERS,"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY THE SAME AUTHOR OF ALL OF THE OTHER PAUL LEVINE BOOKS. UP UNTIL NOW I HAVE ENJOYED EVERY BOOK GREATLY; HOWEVER THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WASN'T SURE IF I WANTED TO COMPLETE IT BUT CONSIDERING THE $7.99 I SPENT, I FORCED MYSELF TO FINISH. IT WAS DRAGGING IN TOO MANY PLACES, THE BICKERING AND LEVINE'S SOAP BOX ABOUT JEWS WAS TOO MUCH. HE WOULD DO WELL WITHOUT BASHING BUSH, REPUBLICANS AND FOX NEWS TOO. PRIOR TO THIS BOOK I HAD RECOMMENDED LEVINE TO ONE OF MY OLD JEWISH FRIENDS AS I THOUGHT HE WOULD ENJOY THE 'JEWISH TINT' BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY. I'VE LOST COUNT OF HOW MANY OF HIS I HAVE READ AND REALLY ENJOYED HIS STYLE UNTIL NOW."
4,It is baby powder; what else can I say?,"It's baby powder; what else can I say? It does what it is supposed to do, though it does tend to cake when sweating. It arrived promptly. It has a pleasant fragrance."
5,Great reading!,"This is one of the best I have read in a long time. I think Mr Brands deserves a literary award. I learned a whole lot, was entertained, and amazed. His writing caused me to actually seem like I was there and I found it most interesting. Now if you like gore or drippy romance novels this is not your book. But if like history, finance, struggle, and learning a little about mining you'll like this. Facsinating topic."
4,Feels more like a novel than a dull history book,"I like to read books about the places I visit. That's why I picked The Age of Gold. It came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.Gold is found during the building of Sutter's Mill in California. People began to flood into California, risking death, willing to sacrifice everything for a chance to get rich.Brands hones in on his characters---Sutter, young men headed to California from all parts, Stanford, Hearst---until the book feels more like a novel than a history book.I'm looking forward to seeing the places mentioned in the book. I feel like I just completed a short course in California history by reading this book."
5,Another outstanding book by H.W. Brands,"I amazed at the range of H.W. Brands knowledge. Not only has he supplies with the greatest biography on BEn Franklin, but he also given us this gem.""The Age of Gold"", is a winner on all fronts. It is highly readable, very informative, sheds light on multiple historical personalities (Stanford, Sherman, Fremont) along with other less notable participants of the era. Brands not only explains everyones involvement in the Gold Rush, but he also follows them through their life. Brands leaves us with no loose ends, everything is explained in full. I was continually amazed at the amount of hardships that these pioneers had to withstand.""The Age of Gold,"" is highly readable (Reading at times like a novel) and I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in 19th century history or the California Gold Rush."
4,mokona girl's bag,"Great, big bag. Nothing fancy, but very useful, you can carry a lot o things in it. Also has an inside pocket for wallet and mobile phone."
5,Extremely fun to read and easy to use when over there,"We took four guidebooks over to Paris for our trip (my third, her first). It ended up being the only guidebook we used. The city walks made exploring the city a breeze.Be prepared. This book definitely has a British persepctive, is very opinionated, and has very few pictures. But, it gave a great sense of persepctive and made it much easier to get context when we were there.Without a doubt, this is a great book to use if you will have the time to explore the city. We have already purchased several more in the line for our honeymoon,"
2,"O.K., but not Willie's best effort","The performance was good, and was basicly most of the standards that Willie always sings. I felt he way just going through the show without a lot of effort, feeling or enjoyment. Not his best preformance."
2,Be Careful!,Make sure to measure your clearance in your auto. I could not use the blind spot mirror in my sedan as the rear view mirror was to close to the roof.
4,OEM mirror makers should learn from this product.,"The optics aren't perfect, and you need 2 inches or more between the top of your existing mirror and the windshield/frame/roof for it to fit; but the product DOES give a convenient and much improved rearward panoramic view for lane changing. It's design concept of allowing the standard mirror's image at center/bottom with extended wide angle images at its sides makes total sense IMO. I wish OEM manufacturers did something similarly with a standard center image melding into a wide angle at its sides. It would be a subtle; but appreciated driving aid and safety improvement for us all.I have used this product in my present car for several years. I'm soon replacing my car, hence my search for a replacement, and subsequent review."
1,Does not t work as promised,I was very disappointed and unhappy with this product. It does not provide any better visiblity and for me it actually hindered visiblity because of the awkward shape and curve to the mirror. I would not recommend this product to someone trying to see thier baby in the back seat either simply bc it doesn't work.
1,Disappointing,"I read the book and frankly, I'm very disappointed. The book borrows heavily from previous ferret authors and is just the same old information repeated. The book is written in a very jerky, unituitive manner and made getting through the book tedious at best. Save your money is my advice!"
1,Skip this one,"This book is self published and the author acknowledges that she is not a ferret expert. Some advice is questionable and could be harmful to ferrets if followed. Stick with the ferret ""bible,"" Ferrets for Dummies, which is knowledgeable and written with the help of ferret experts."
1,Not very informative,I found this book somewhat boring. The information wasn't very good at all. Then I discovered the author isn't a ferret expert and I was disappointed.
4,Massage Chair Review,The chair has a nice appearance. The power reclining & ottoman work well and is fairly quiet. I had expected the ottoman to function a little better than it does- I had expected the feel of the airbags working independently. There are a lot of programmable massage features I haven't fully explored yet. Overall we do like the chair.
2,"Pacifier book for PRESCHOOLERS, NOT TODDLERS","This book has really neat illustrations, but lacks in story line. Marlon is the monster's name who is encouraged by his granny and mom to quit using his ""noo-noo"" or pacifier. He does quit by the end, but a bit abruptly.My two year old has a hard time sitting still for the entire book, which is unusual for her. The book is listed for 4 to 6 year olds, but it uses words like hopeless, drastic, astonished, ridiculous, and dwindled. The language used just seems a little advanced. She also was bothered by the monsters calling the ""paci"" a ""noo-noo"".The thing that really bothered me about the book was the granny was so negative! She says, ""he (Marlon) looks ridiculous with that STUPID big thing stuck in this mouth all the time."" I don't know about you, but we try not to call anything stupid in our home. I haven't found a great pacifier book yet, but I definitely would not recommend this one for any child under the age of 4."
1,Endorses Bullying & Shaming,"Wow. This book flat-out endorses bullying, both by family members and children at school. The message is: If your child is still using a pacifier, try shaming them into stopping.Marlon is still attached to his pacifier, called a noo-noo in the book. He is taunted and bullied into giving it up with lovely lines from his grandmother like: ""He looks ridiculous with that stupid big thing stuck in his mouth all the time.""While his friends say: ""Who's a big baby, then?"" jeered Basher. ""Does the little baby need his pacifier?"" Alligatina sneered.""And in the end, it seems to be circumstances and peer pressure that get Marlon to (temporarily) give up his binky.Are you serious? This is awful! I want my 2 year-old to give up the pacifier as much as any other parent, but is this the way to do it? I would think not. We'll go back to the made-up 'Binky Fairy' concept of little babies needing her pacifiers before I'll ever read this book again."
5,The Vogues: The Return Of The Good Old Songs,"Hats off to producer, Bill ""Chess"" Inglot's work in bringing back two of the best albums The Vogues have ever done on one CD.The rich harmony and instrumental background are still there, and without the clicks and pops that came with the original vinyl recordings.Although, I have to disagree with the other reviewer's reason for The Vogues disappearance from the spotlight - they were swindled out of the right to use their own group name to perform or record under by a manager at 20th Century Records. And, since then, some counterfeit ""Vogues"" have been performing their songs throught the years and taking credit for the work of the original Vogues. Go to vogues.com and what you'll see won't be the original members of The Vogues."
5,Talk about bringing back memories...,"I loved this album when I was young, and I was thrilled to have them brought to mind again. I listen to the album all the time, along with a couple of other groups from that time, namely the Four Aces and The Hilltoppers. However, the Vogues are tops in my book."
3,Lecuona's piano masterpiece,"These CDs were hard to find. The first CD is lively and contains the most popular and well known compositions. The second CD, starts a bit slow and somewhat repetitive but after the middle, it gets better. The quality of the recording is not great but not too bad given that they were played by Lecuona himself. This collection is a MUST for classical and popular piano music lovers."
1,Not what I expected...not beautiful music to my ears.,I did not care for this CD. It sounded old fashioned. Somehow the review I read made it sound like I just had to add it to my collection....not beautiful music to my ears.
2,Philadelphia Sound,Disappointed in this DVD which promised much more in the blurb. A selection of just about OK preformances of not well-known numbers by artists well past their sell-by dates. I expected something much more vibrant which would remind me of the good times. Sadly I was left with a feeling of 'what was all that about?'. Check very carefully before buying that the artists and numbers on the disc are really what you want to hear. In my case they weren't and I didn't.
5,GREAT DVD,I have played this DVD several times since receiving it. Each time it brings back great memories. I'am looking for more DVD concerts like this one...........The video and sounds are GREAT !
5,Great classic R&B!,"If you love the Sound of Philly, this is the dvd for you. They're all there--Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, The O'Jays, The Delfonics, Jerry Butler, along with a full orchestra with violinists and mostly all musicians of color. Makes you proud."
4,A wonderful book about an amazing woman.,"This book was given to me by a co-worker who mentioned that Dr. Mary Rowland was his great-grandmother. It is a wonderful memoir of a dynamic woman on the frontier of career-oriented women. I was facinated by her first-person accounts of case studies, medical treatments of the day, and especially her insistance of cleanliness, at a time when most in the medical profession knew little to nothing about sterilization. This book is a must read for any one with a layperson's devotion to medical history."
2,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered the 1 liter bottles w/covers for a good reason. The 1 liter bottles would fit a specific area that I needed for carrying water. Instead the company thought that sending me the 1.5 liter would be better. I am stuck with these large water holders that I cannot use. I ordered a specific item and was sent something else. Not happy. AND the insulation is very ineffective, the lids are a hassle to get back on after removal."
2,Not what I was expecting,"My son requested this book because ""his friends have the series"". I don't know anything about Dragon Ball, other than what they show on TV (Nick & Cartoon Network). The show seems to be harmless so I assumed the book would be, too. Since I'm unfamiliar with the original series I was unaware that the book is for ages 13 & up. Plus, the picture posted doesn't show this on the cover. Thumbing through I found references to touching breasts (34-C specifically) & taking off girls panties. While this is fine for an older audience, I don't feel it's appropriate for a 9 year old. This review is for parents that may be in the same boat as me, thinking the book will be Ok for kiddos, but (in my opinion) it's not."
4,An Interesting Look,This brief but interesting look at one of the most documented families in the world. Stockard Channing does a great job in her narration and some of the film and photos are some that I have not seen before. It documents the mystic and the media facination with the family accuratly and with a bit more dignity than so many others. Well worth the purchase
3,Not worth more than 3 stars,"This cd is not my ""cup of tea"". The performances are sloppy and most of the works like Swan Lake, Water Music, and La Mer, can easily be found, in their entirety, on other discs. (Not to mention they'll most likely be a better recording) Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere."
1,Tame,"After giving this book a few reads, I can safely say that the author is simply too tame. I cannot get any feeling out of the words and the verses do not flow well. Not saying this to badmouth the author, but I just cannot identify with this writing. If you want to be moved by poetry, look elsewhere."
5,Reminds Me of Jon Franklin.,"Franklin writes cliff-hangers about brain surgery. Ruhlman writes cliff-hangers about kiddie heart surgey. This effort satisfies my criteria for a good read: good writing, good story, and holds my attention. Plus it'll make you crazy if youre pregnant! 5 STARS! Hey! Who's paying for these million dollar operations?"
2,Fascinating topic ruined by lousy writing,"The situations and people discussed in the book are really fascinating, if you can get past the irritating writing. The author seems more interested in making the reader believe how smart he is (a chunk of the first chapter is about how he's written other books) than in informing the reader about this complex topic. That said, if you can tolerate the writing style the topic is very interesting and it's worth reading for the a neat peek into the largely-unknown world of pediatric cardiac surgery."
5,Outstanding and VERY well written.,"I found this book outstanding. The author puts the time into providing a great deal of detail that really make you understand what's going on.Many people know what it feels like to have a sick child and hand them over to a surgeon, but this book will allow you to know how it feels from the other side of the equation and understand how the doctor feels about it.I've often wondered if doctors begin to see their work as just another job, but if all doctors are like the doctors written about in this book, then no, they do not.."
4,Great read,The book was well written. A must read for anyone having to deal with pediatric heart problems. My daughter is a cardiac surgeon and verified that it is accurate. My only complaint was that the print was misaligned and located close to the binding on a lot of the pages which made reading very annoying.
4,"Funny, cute, definitively Canadian","A genuinely funny film, but in a Canadian way, i.e. you may never laugh out loud during the entire film, but you will always be amused and entertained. No nudity, although the girls are really attractive and are often in various states of undress, but in a natural way (not in a porno way). I appreciated this movie for its believable and genuinely likeable characters - if you're tired of hollywood blockbuster stereotype characters and scripts, this is an entertaining change of pace. Super low-budget, the acting and script carry the film entirely. If you're looking for sex, look elsewhere."
4,"Seriously funny, dark comedy","Seems to be a very true-to-life portrayal of life in a body rub parlor. The movie tries not to be judgemental about the work these women do, but does present it from their point of view. A lot of daily challenges, of going far enough without going too far, keeping it legal, etc.Don McKellar was brilliant as the nerdy manager of the parlor, who seemed to be in way over his head with this job. He gradually got very good at this job in a big way.There's a very twisted humorous ending that came out of nowhere. Extremely imaginative. It sort of kept true to the nature of these people, where nothing is as it seems on the surface."
3,Rub & Tug,"I had so much fun seeing this film. Go see it. The women, the music ... loved all of it. I even got the soundtrack ... it rocks."
3,not just for canadaphiles,"i don't think it's worth $22.95. tara spencer-nairns is hot. loved her in ""new waterford girl."" she was the punchy chick. she's probably not quite as good in this film. it's not her fault.the dude that was smuggling bird eggs in ""exotica"" is also in the film.looks like it was filmed in toronto. also features the chick who wasn't sara polley in the new version of ""dawn of the dead."" or so i've read. she's pretty cute, too.supposedly, the director spent a year hanging around massage parlours doing research for the movie. seems like she's got it right. maybe too right. made me feel a little creepy. at times, like a voyeur and other times like a participant. might just be guilt... it has some good plot twists and a happy ending."
1,Yeah...,"Okay, I typed into the search engine on Amazon, ""Massage Therapy Ethics."" This popped up (no pun intended). I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm sure it's a fabulous b-movie semi-soft core production. However, as a licensed massage therapist--I want to scream, ""Nooooooooooo!"" I guess, take it for what it is, but don't ever schedule an appointment with me or any other licensed professional and expect those outfits, or that behavior. To the filmaker--do a little research that doesn't involve prostitutes or pimps, and you might actually learn something."
2,Repetitive and boring,"The subject matter is quite interesting, but no tangible Darwinian perspective of creativity emerges from this book. Apart from that, this stuff is so interesting that one could make the book a real page-turner (think Dawkins or Simon Singh). While this work is slow, repetitive and ultimately dissatisfying. And inconclusive, too: all these lists of geniuses do not supply any real, verifyable statistic data.Worth to leaf through, but not much more."
4,How to prepare when you don't know what will happen?,"In narrative film the writer, producer and director pay the actors and crew to do what the writer has planned. But in documentary, not only do the subjects not always act as planned or expected, author Hampe instructs that we shouldn't want or expect them to. Hampe's discussions of preparation are extremely well thought and reasoned and the issue of ethics is well-treated. I was intruiged by his historical explaination of how filmmaking came to be such a mercilessly perfectionist craft. Film school instructors should learn well from this book and pass this knowledge on to their students. I will read and refer to it again in the future."
5,Great Introductory Book,"I took a two week documentary filmmaking course recently and this book was our text. The majority of the class had no prior experience with making a movie of any sort so this book became our life. I felt it was very easy to comprehend and gave ALOT of great advice. For those who did have experience in filmmaking, which included shooting, editing, and distrubution, this was a refresher for them. Overall I'd say it was a great reference book to rely on."
3,A very helpful introduction to the world of documentaries,"I found this book extremely useful and does as it claims-- covers all aspects of documentary production. Although written intially before NLE, it has adequately been updated to cover NLE. I found the planning part very useful but had to make my own notes to organize the author's thoughts. Otherwise would have deserved 4 stars."
1,All over the place,"I felt like I was back at UNCA in a Theory class. This guy was all over the place with his ideas and often repeated them. This book is old, refering to high 8 video as the best available. He wrote this before the boom of reality on TV. There's no good outlines of what to do and not do, how to set up interveiws, shots or anything of that matter. It's full of ludicrous examples that extend to great, uneccessary links. I hate this book."
5,Best ever,"I've bought this exact model (608) for years. Best shoe ever. Usually I get them at Sears because once a year they have a really good sale price on them. This year, however, all I could find was the 608-v2 (version 2). I tried them on and they felt like crap. I did some research on the web, and apparently New Balance considers the version 2 as an improved model or upgrade. I don't know how they could be so wrong. Also, basically every review I read on the web said that reviewer hated the upgrade. So, with a little more research I finally found my size of the old model on Amazon. I'm hoping New Balance sees the error of their ways and reverts to manufacturing the old 608. Otherwise, a lot of us may be buying Nikes."
3,608 vw 608v2 and 608v3,"I have worn the 608 for years. They were very comfortable and durable. I tried the new 608v2 and 608v3 (both white and brown)and they are not nearly as comfortable nor as well made in my opinion. I wish the old 608's were still made. Hopefully the MX608WT is as good as the the old 608 and as other reviews say. I also have one pair of brown of the 609 model. It is good but has just a little different feel for my foot. I wear it in the winter rainy, wet and muddy conditions because it doesn't show the dirt and mud. The white ones I use mostly in the summer dry months. For me the 608 is better for the shape of my foot. I miss it. I will try the MX608WT but will try to find one in the shoe stores to check for fit etc first. Ive rated it a 3 star only because I haven't worn the MX608WT yet but would rate the old 608 a 5 star."
3,Okay,My husband is very hard on shoes. This pair did not hold up. Within 5 weeks the tongue flapped off the right shoe and we had to buy another pair. We ended up purchaseing another New Balance shoe that held up perfectly!
5,New Balance MX 608 CrossTraining Shoe,"I am a power walker, 3 miles per day, seven days a week, in all kinds of weather. I need a shoe that is light weight, offers superior arch support and heel cushion, yet is durable and can take a beating. That's why my last 4 pair of cross training shoes have been New Balance MX608s. They are perfect for me."
4,Good Shoes,"I've been buying this brand for quite a few years now. I haven't been disappointed yet. Good shoes, great service, was shipped to me ian a very timely manner."
3,Virtual reality never looked so real!,"It's great,very fun and entertaining.But the ending is realy bad, I dont even get it,But it's a not a bad anime.It's just that the story is building up to a great ending or a good one at least,but noting it's a crappy ending.I really don't know what happen the story was so good.But if you just want a new anime and don't know what to get check this one out it's not that bad."
5,Walker The Seventh Season,My grandson absolutely loves these movies of Walker. The quality of the product was very good.I plan to order more in the future.
4,Gotta Love Walker,"Gotta Love Walker, good wholesome values lot's of great action, This was a good season, fun new cast additions, and even more action."
3,OK...but not necessary,"Not bad, but not up to the quality of their full length albums. Get those instead, starting with Mirror of Madness, which is exceptionally good."
2,Sinful Deeds 2,"I almost bought this dvd, but after reading the review I was glad that I didn't. I hate when they try to sell us movies that are cut and then call it unrated. Please save us the time and money and offer us the original version or not at all."
5,Great show!,"This show is much better than what's airing on tv now. Father in law loves it and was a great gift, thank you!"
5,Superb Season 8!!,"This season had excellent episodes throughout. The characters and acting styles changed - more mellow, intellectual, subdued but great stories and great acting. One of my favorite seasons. No duds here. Even the quality of the remastering was very good. No problems at all."
4,Some things are worth reliving,Enjoy watching Hawaii Five O and remembering watching as a young girl. Love the BIG old cars!! Who wouldn't want to be in Hawaii?
5,My Wife (& Sons) R Fans of This Series,"I am not a fan of this old 1970's TV series, but my wife is. She should be the one to write this review, but she is too busy working while I am retired. So I'll just say this - my wife watches the series over&over&over&over again. Most of the time, while she watches it, she sleeps."
4,hawaii 5-0 eighth season,enjoyed it much -- for fans of hawaii 5-0. enjoyed seeing the same actors in different roles -- makes the make believe more interesting.
3,Hawaii Five-O Eight season,As usual we have enjoyed watching the episodes in this set and cannot wait until the next season is available. The only problem ---however is that one of the discs had a scratch that made it skip in 2 episodes. Therefore we missed some of the program. This is not the first time we have had this issue with dics purchased from Amazon.
5,One GREAT Watch!,"Yeah it's a little big, but it fits great. I haven't taken it off since it arrived. After the first day or two you don't even realize you have it on. The strap is different, but it keeps the watch secure and doesn't allow it to flip around on your wrist. It's super accurate (so far) and the second hand lines up with the markers... which is very important on a quartz watch.This one is definitely a keeper!UPDATE:I've been wearing this watch almost 24-7 since the day I got it. Last night I took it off and noticed that the metal band keeper, was wearing a hole in my wrist. Looks like I'm going to have to find a different band for it :(UPDATE II:I was wearing the watch 24-7.. or, I was wearing it while sleeping. I stopped doing that, and the metal keeper stopped wearing a hole in my wrist... fair trade if you ask me! LOL. : )"
4,best and stylist for men,"reserved battery even I don't wear for month still running,good for swim never take off."
5,Great Monster of a Watch,"I will say that it took me several months to work up the courage to purchase this watch. I hesitated because it looked too bulky. In reality it is bulky but that is what I was looking for in this particular watch. Surprisingly, it wasn't as bulky as I thought it would be. I purshased the watch to wear during the warm months with short sleeve shirts. It is an eye catcher but I don't care about that really. I own 4 Citizen Eco-Drives and love the brand. This watch is built like a tank and I love the simplicity. Time and date is all you're getting from this monster and that is just fine with me. I wear my more expensive and overly complicated Eco-Drive watches when I need more than just time and date. If you like quality along with size, this is the watch for you. If you plan on wearing it with dress shirts, you may want to go in another direction because most cuffs will not fit over this monster. All in all another great product and value from Citizen."
2,Seconds Didn't Line Up,"One of my pet peeves with a quartz watch is when the seconds hand does not align with the second marks on the dial. On the watch I received this was the case, so I had to return the watch. The return process was easy and painless, however."
3,Disappointed,"Loved the styling, but it sits too high on the wrist to fit underneath a long sleeve shirt and it's too expensive to use solely as a short sleeve watch. Maybe if I lived in Key West...."
2,facts not dreams,Dyson fails to reach a high scientific level since hes always regretting that there is not enough of what he thinks is social justice. If 20 percent of people do 80 percent of the work you cant blame them for looking for more. more money means i have a better life. So please Dyson more facts less guilt. And less pipedreams. Solar is not yet the answer though nuclear is. All fear of nuclear tech neglects facts like steam killing an average od 3 people a day when it first came into use. Temper your fear and hope with a little experience.
5,"a sensitive, humanistic look at Pohl's favorite themes","Too bad this one's out of print! The protagonist is fascinating, and the story poigniant. One of Pohl's best. Compares very favorably with his more well known works."
1,Country Roses Bowl,I ordered this in September and still have no received it. It is now the middle of November.
2,Interesting plot but gets lost amongst too many points of view,"An interesting plot combining bits of WWII outrages with what is happening in nineties' Urbino. The tale twists and weaves a lot due to a mulitude of characters introduced. Many of the characters are implausible and the book has to contrive various unconvincing vignettes around them to knit them into the story. My general reaction was that the reader was introduced to too many points of view which weren't prioritised and as the book draws to a conclusion I began asking myself who cares? Also there is an annoying habit throughout of introducing the criminals in short conversatiosn without their identifying names. They usually hint at violence to come, but at the end of the book I wondered why they were there at all, since their roles are both thin and thinly described. I agree entirely with the reviewers who wrote that the book took too long to read. It is not a page turner."
2,something is missing,"This book has brilliant and beautiful moments. It has all the ingredients to make it a book I could love: art, history, Italy, mystery, small towns. Writing is very good. Yet, it just did not all come together for me. There was just nothing to hold it all. I was having hard time identifying with any of the characters - they all seemed sketchy and remote. They lacked warmth of real people. Art and history provided just some fragments of the background, never being explored enough to become interesting.Given all that, the plot itself was not interesting enough, and mystery not much of a mystery. I did not find myself wanting to go back to reading."
3,Slow and quite vuage,"I was excited to read a book that was a historical-modern-Italian-art book, but it took me a while to get through the book. There seemed to be many unnecessary characters and a lot of vamped up importance of things that you never really find out much about. I thought that it could have been much better, but I gave it 3 stars because it is a story that had a lot of potential."
2,Waking Raphael,"This book got such high reviews from everyone else, that I was really excited to read it. Was I ever disappointed. The book moves so slowly, I was forced to go to the end to find out what was happening before I was bored to death. If you don't want a quickly moving story with interesting characters, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, I would pass it up. Dull! Dull! Dull!"
4,"Bought for new price, got used book!!","Book was informative and there are really good execises to do to help you out.The book was in good shape when I received it, BUT someone had written and underlined quite a bit of the text in it with red ink, and had even written some notes in there. I didn't complain, because it didn't really bother me, but if you are expecting a NEW book to be delivered, you might be diassapointed!!"
2,"Disappointed - expected the ""old"" Megaherz","Last year I discovered Megaherz. Wer Bist Du was the first cd I bought. After my first listen, I wondered how I have gotten through life all this time without knowing about Megaherz. I purchased a couple other older releases and it was pure bliss!I dreamed of seeing them on tour one day and of future releases!Then '5' came out and I was ecstatic! That was until I listened. I wondered why the heck it sounded so drastically different. That's when I discovered that Noel and Alexx left the band. What a frickin' tragedy.If you are a fan of Megaherz's older releases you likely will be disappointed with '5'."
4,Beautiful food,"Having had the fortune to eat at Tetsuyas, I could not resist buying the book. Tetsuya is a master and a complete perfectionist. I do not use this book often as I find it a little like following a Japanese Thomas Keller (lots of work!) but it is a gorgeous book from an inspirational chef."
3,Just missed the mark!,"Altough this is a beautifully illustrated book, I found that the recipes I tried seemed to just miss the mark. I am an experienced Asian cook and have lots of knowledge of fresh Asian ingredients so I was not daunted by the recipes. When each dish was completed it looked beautiful but tasted as if something was missing. I have tried recreating several of the dishes to no avail. Puzzling!"
3,THE RETURN OF AKHENATON???,"His first solo album ""Meteque et Mat"" was a bomb, then he came with ""Sol Invictus"" which was ok, and now the ""Black Album"". I was very dissapointed with this album, I expected more from Mr.Akh. The lyrics lack originality, which made ""Meteque et Mat"", and all his work with IAM very good. It seems that this album is really a continuation of ""Sol Invictus"". Some of his songs here like ""Une journee chez le diable"", J'voulais dire"", and ""Mes soleils et mes lunes"", were taken from Sol Invictus and added on the Black Album. Without a doubt, the best song on this cd is ""Akh"", makes me listen to this song over and over again. Another great one is ""Ecoeure"". This cd is ok, but not Akhenaton's best work, his best solo work is ""Meteque et Mat"". If you dont have any of Akhenaton's solo cd's, I would recommend ""Meteque et Mat"", over this one ""Black Album"".Any comments on French Rap/Hip Hop, please e-mail me"
3,OK album,"Most people like Sol invictus better, but personally I like this one better. Not by much, if I could I would have given it 3.5 out of 5."
5,one of the best classic hiphop!!,"In this album,I found unusual style of hiphop songs.this can be one of my favorite hiphop album.I don`t understand french language butI don`t have to care about it,because sounds are really cool!!Excellent!!"
5,Nice book,"Bought this book for a trip to London that a friend and I are planning. I love that the book gives maps, starting points, estimated times, and suggestions on where to eat and other places of interest."
2,Heavy and Short,"If you like a heavy slide for your second or third finger, this is it. Not for the pinky. This is a meaty slide, and short. If you want a heavy slide for high action this would work."
4,"Intense, Entertaining Man's Movie","Wow, this is an intense story that should keep you interested for the full two hours. The five main roles are all men and they are pretty interesting, led by Danny Glover's character, who is very, very creepy. Lee Ermey, the fanatical drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is fun to watch in here. Jared Leto and Ted Levine also contribute nicely.I'm hesitant to say much about this film for fear of giving anything away for those who have not seen it. Suffice to say its a rough movie in regards to language, violence and general attitude but the story grabs you quickly and is tough to put down once you are into it.****possible spoiler**** It's true the story isn't really pieced together until the last few minutes., so be aware of that. The fact that FBI agent Dennis Quaid would figure things out to the exact minute does stretch credibility so don't look for a film that makes a lot of sense: it's simply a very tense thriller that entertains, so it serves its purpose."
4,Great thriller,"An FBI agent hot on the trail of a serial killer pays a high price when the murderer makes it a personal game. Dennis Quaid plays agent Frank LaCrosse, a man taken off the case when the killer kidnaps his young son. Frank refuses to give up the chase to find the man who stole his child. The killer leaves a trail of blood and some subtle clues along the way, but Frank will still need the help of a veteran, small town sheriff if he hopes to get his son back alive. The film was scattered with enough red herrings to keep the plot interesting, though some of the roles hinted at cliches. However, the dialogue clipped along and the action scenes kept it moving. Certainly not a 'yawner'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,"WHITE SNOW, RED BLOOD AND GREY KILLER","Directed by Jeb Stuart, co-writer of DIE HARD and THE FUGITIVE, SWITCHBACK is a movie which deserves more than the polite silence surrounding it.It's winter in Colorado and a FBI agent is tracing a serial killer. He has to cope with his superiors who don't want him anymore to solve this case and with local sheriffs more concerned by their reelection than by the arrest of the killer.And there's a third guy in the chase who might or might be not involved in this cat and mouse game. You always believe to be a step ahead of the hunter but you soon have to admit that the director plays with your nerves.Dennis Quaid and Danny Glover are really good in this movie, playing characters of multiple dimensions. There are also a lot of suspense and riveting action.Too bad that the bonus features are not at the level of the movie.A not to be put aside DVD."
4,Solid Acting and Good Story Line,"Although it is not the most action-packed movie in the world, it does provide very good character development. This is a movie to watch when you are alone and want to really get into a story. It takes time to develop, but overall, a very good movie. If you expect action or a thumping heart, this movie isn't for you. A wonderful performance from Danny Glover...one of his best."
3,Killer leaves trail of clues...,While watching The Bone Collector at a theater recently I was reminded of Switchback and the similar theme of a killer leaving intentional clues and daring the police to find them before they killed again. Although both movies suffered from Hollywood's habit of providing unlikely coincidences I enjoyed both films. Switchback on DVD is close to reference quality with a great picture enhancing the beautiful scenery and tremendous audio provided by the Dolby Digital soundtrack. The fight scene toward the end is particularly exciting with the sound cranked up. The movie's locales are off the beaten track and that alone can sometimes be recommendation enough. See it...at least once.
4,HEY! WHADAYA WANT ANYWAY?,"There appeared to be enough mystery and strangeness to start out with.Two fine actors - performance very good - story [predictable?] oh well.A bit gory! but then --- what makes a movie? the back and forth suspense kept your attention. Certainly enjoyed the Sheriff - FBI appeared ineffectual - Quaid's determination to find the seriel killer was understandable - Glover's motive not quite clear but played with panauche.Hey, it was worth seeing - definitely recommended if your not squeamish! [1997] not bad."
4,Swtchback,Danny Glover is believeable (as always) in this mystery/thriller. Unique role/ unique screenplay.
3,"Above average, but just barely.",A slightly above-average thriller/suspense/chase/adventure type movie. Good acting and coherent plot help to move the story along.Rental only.
1,BOOOOOOOORING,"I'm a great Dennis Quaid and Jared Leto fan, but even them couldn't keep me interested in this movie."
1,"something is missing in this movie, sadly","i saw this movie with a feeling of looking forward to it but like the previous reviewer, it couldn't kept me interested. The script is good, the actors are very good and still it seems there is something missing to keep you interested. Definitely not a title i would buy."
3,Gave away the killer too soon,It would have been better if the action picked up right when the killer is known. It just wasn't intense enough with only having to guess between a couple people who was the killer.
4,Where Is the sick Lynch,"Ok i never have something to say bad about Lynch but what the hell is goin on. Why does Ced put out a new lynch cd every 2 month and Lynch does nothin. Overall this cd is tight because of the lynch parts, but i wish lynch would come out wit something like seasson of the sick one more time for his true supporters always playin fo sho"
1,Can't be lynch hung,"After buying this album, thinking it would be as good as season of the sicc or loaded. I found out I was wrong. Almost every beat sucks, no way lynch made these beats. If he did, he needs to start asking his fans for advise."
5,tight.........,i dont know what that other lady was talkin about but this cd is tight......i dont care if you buy the daym cd or not.......i bought it and thats all that matters.......
2,WHAT IS THIS?,"WE ALL KNOW THAT LYNCH IS ONE OF THE BEST RAPPERS OUT, BUT WHAT IS THIS? I BOUGHT THIS CD, AND I FEEL LIKE I GOT ROBBED. THE BEATS ARE HORRIBLE, THE FLOWS ARE AVERAGE, AND SOME SONGS EVEN RUN OVER INTO EACH OTHER. WHAT IS CEDRIC SINGLETON DOING? I AM THE BIGGEST LYNCH FAN OUT, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH BUYING. LIKE LYNCH SAID IF IT DOESN'T SAY SICCMADE ON IT DON'T BUY IT."
3,y'all n--g-az is bi--h...you know that.....,"talkin' all this smack...like SICC & HIGH ain't one of the tightest BLH tracks evermade or something....yeah that's right, you white boyz hatin on this album better go and listen to that one again...SONG 3 AND RECKOGNIZE THIS ONE SONG MAKES THIS A 3 ON SCALE OF 5 INSTANTLY....jerks go listen to snoop.-season of da ssssssssssss"
3,where are the b-sides?,"Again, I own several copies of this album - WB CD, Virgin CD with 'Oh No...' and LP. It's the one where start getting more rigid in their songwriting but nevertheless produce plenty of intelligent and original songs from their world view. Plus it has their most popular songs, ""Whip It"" (which despite it's status as a novelty hit is a really great song), ""Girl U Want"", ""Freedom of Choice"" and ""Gates of Steel."" However, while it's neat seeing the entire track listing of the 'Devo Live' 12"" EP as bonus tracks, it's missing the b sides! What kind of CD reissue excludes single b sides? Where's ""Turnaround"", the b-side to ""Freedom of Choice"" single (I think?) or ""Snowball"" (dance revolution)? Why would I need this reissue, it seems useless to me."
5,Fun music,I bought this for my brother for Christmas! He always liked Devo and this was a fun gift.It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.
4,"Now, That's Pep!","Ahh, Devo...What to say about our glorious nerds? Had to pleasure of seeing the original line up back in the day (New Years Eve in San Francisco 1981 or so) and they kicked ass. And this is the album they were touring on, riding on the back of ""Whip It.""Crazy synth lines. Techno beats before techno was techno. The occasional killer guitar riff. Hilarious lyrics. What's not to like here?Essential songs: Whip It. Girl U Want. Gates of Steel.If you know Devo, you love this. If you're thinking about trying out Devo, play the sample of Whip It. If you dig it, buy this. If not, move along.Added bonus: Devo's complete LIVE EP tacked onto this album (which I still have on vinyl somewhere, I think) which shows that Devo could actually ROCK live!My wife just rolls her eyes when I play this. But my kids dig it.I say ""Whip it. Whip it good."""
4,Still fun after all these years!,"This album still is great to listen to after all these years. Devo was an integral part of my high school years. The various performances on SNL and of Fridays (the ABC 80's knock off of SNL). The best part is that they are still touring!A lot of the subliminal sarcasm was lost on my people, especially after ""Whip It"" made the Top 40.People should consider their first album ""Are We Not Men?""Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!"
4,Fantastic remaster - and HDCD too!,"The only version I had ever heard of this album was the original CD release from the late 80's. I never owned the vinyl on this one. Well, I can tell you, if you have that old CD release, this new mastering is definitely worth the price. It's almost like hearing a completely different mix. Incredible improvement compared to the original CD release. And as a nice bonus for those of us that have CD players with HDCD decoding, the CD is encoded with HDCD (though this is not indicated anywhere on the packaging). Frankly, this was never one of my favorite DEVO albums, but I think now it was because the CD sounded so dull and lifeless, almost like I had cotton stuffed in my ears. With the way the new mastering sounds, this just might become my favorite DEVO album. One quibble: I wish they had included ""Turn Around"", which was the B-side on the ""Whip It"" 45 single."
3,Devo hits it big (and falls short),"After their excellent first 2 albums, Q&A and the underrated masterpiece Duty Now For The Future, the Devo spudboys hit it big with Freedom Of Choice, thanks in large part to the novelty song Whip It. This is the LAST time I mention Whip It in this review! Got it? Good! Believe it or not, this is my 2nd least-favorite Devo album. The songs are by no means bad (Mr. B's Ballroom is my favorite), its just that none of the songs are very, well, memorable. Their weirdness was sharply beginning to decline and nothing really either rocks the house down or has a bouncy uppity beat. Also, its a very short album, as none of the songs hit the 3 minute mark. But all in all, its Devo!!! Freedom Of Choice is not horrible at all, but it pales compared to the majority of Devo's other work."
3,3 and a half,"Good fun campy and mostly artless, Devo signed on to the 80s with a twisted take on rock and roll. Not as good now as it was back when but still worthwhile. Not sure though of a previous comment about Devo avoiding the ""cultural imperialism"" of E. Presley??? If anything E. Presley was the inspiration for Devo and almost every rock artist after 1956."
1,Not good,"I have to be honest about this movie and let me clear some stuff up before i start writing, I am a christian and I believe in good christian acting but in this movie the only thing i like was just the preaching but everything else was just waste of time, there was no extras in the movies, the video is very poor, and I think the took the whole movie with only one camera. it did not worth the money i pay for it to be honest, I wont recommended it to any one."
4,Not for the Absolute Beginner,"I found it a bit ridiculous that the author chose to begin teaching Swedish like she did. If you haven't had experience learning a language before, and/or you do not have a perfect attention level, just looking at the cover of this thing will give you a headache.The book begins with a load of complicated (Well, complicated for the absolute beginner) vocabulary, and it explains very little. The characters--The Taylor Family--just got off the plane from England. The father of the family begins to explain his occupation, his family members, etc.Truly, if you have a good amount of time to sit down and really, fully emerge yourself in the lesson and all of the cliff notes, this can be actually quite helpful for you. But at the same time you're more than likely [like I did] going to need a number of other resources.Frankly, it isn't worth getting unless you have some sort of background knowledge or practice on the Swedish Language, and can be very helpful after that."
4,A Very Helpful Course,"Teach Yourself Swedish seems like an at-home or on-the-go class. It helps build vocabulary rather fast for me, although I sometimes have to look up verb infinitives elsewhere. I like how Vera Croghan goes through dialogues and some activities on the CDs. I think this course is for those that want to learn Swedish or develop fluency in that language."
1,Not for Absolute Beginners,"From page 1 of the introduction, Teach Yourself Swedish claims to be for absolute beginners, however I would disagree. There is nothing wrong with fast pace dialogs once you already have the basics of pronunciation down but this book never helps with that.You don't get word by word pronunciation of the vocabulary or phrases leaving you in a bit of a dazed in a sea of sounds trying to pull apart the words to be able to later form your own sentence.From chapter one, dialog one the pace is pretty fast for someone with no previous knowledge of even one word of Swedish. The progression of the grammar points leaves a lot to be desired. Basically it is a poor or rather frustrating course if you are an absolute beginner.I am glad I didn't buy this book but rather rented it from the library.But I would say that it would be great for someone with previous knowledge of Swedish because the dialogs would be good listening practice."
3,the darker the lingonberry...,"this book as seen in other reviews moves really fast and would only be reccomended as a supplement to other (slower) courses. there is no spoken section that focuses on how to pronounce the 3 new swedish sounds and it seems heavy on phrase memorization rather than language understanding. the book & cds are not all bad, it does help the reader/listener pick up some vocab rather quickly and is good training for training your ear to begin understanding certain phrases that would be spoken to you in swedish. i purchased 5 courses and books on swedish and the best one by far is the free/public domain one Swedish: Basic Course from the Foriegn Service Institute/ U.S. Dept. of State. it seems i've been using everything i purchased as a supplement to that, and those being this book along with 201 Swedish Verbs, Essentials of Swedish Grammar, and An Essential Grammar, and Rossetta Stone."
4,"Yep, definitely not for beginners, but....","...used in conjunction with other 'Learn Swedish' programs, this is an outstanding resource to help you learn the Swedish language. Pimsler is okay to get you going, but is wayyyy overpriced for what you get: roughly 10 hours of very basic, very repetitious words and phrases that leave you wanting a whole lot more. This set, on the other hand, is jam-packed with useful, real-world dialogs spoken by native-speaking Swedes. The book is decent, but better understood by the more advanced student. Yes, you will need to work hard and put some effort into it, but I think that really goes without saying if you are serious and truly want to learn any foreign language. I use this along with Rosetta Stone and I am progressing nicely with learning Swedish (Rosetta Stone is pricey, but use the money you'd waste on Pimsler and apply it to Rosetta Stone to defray the cost)."
4,Good beginners book,"I used this book and CD set as part of an independent study in Swedish. I had little to no experience with Swedish beforehand but I found it relatively straight-forward. However, due to my own negligence I suppose, I did not realize that this book is based on British English and not American English. As a result, a few of the pronunciations were a bit tricky, but really nothing to worry about."
1,To advance,This is far to advance for a beginners level. No help at all if your a beginner. I recommend Pimslers...
2,poor beginner materials..,"if you are an absolute beginner, find another product. the book is poorly laid out, difficult to navigate, and has few reinforcement excerises. the cds are great for learning pronunciation but they rarely speak slowly enough for you to repeat the sentences. two thumbs serioussssly down."
2,Wrong Movie on this Dollar Store Transfer!,"First off ""The Return to Treasure Island"" appears nowhere on this DVD except on the cover, typical of made in China dollar store movie blunders! Instead there's an old Austrailian TV show that you probably never heard of, indeed featuring Robert Newton in the worst acting of his career on extremely low budget sets. The supposed ""Digital Remaster"" is less than spectacular, probably refering to the fact that any DVD is a digital format. Still an okay value for the dollar I paid for it. Prirates of the Black Hawk is certainly rare, but the detail is below average, color is faded, and the sound recieved no restoration. The print that was converted to DVD was very old.For an excellent value and a good transfer of the full length movie supposed to be on this DVD try the Miracle Pictures transfer of ""Return to Treasure Island""."
4,great but false info,"It is titled Woody Herman featuring Stan Getz- but- one of the great selections ""Sweet and Lovely"" is Flip Phillips' very well known Tenor specialty. Misleading, but not a rip off, except of the Very wonderful Flip Phillips."
4,"Light, Satisfying Crunch","If you are like me, and you avoid overly-oily snackswhich tend to be heavy on the salt, then give this verygood popcorn a try. Light, crunchy, and fresh---itsatisfies that salty-urge, minus the guilt."
3,"more salt, please","It's good, but I prefer more salt. Moreover, it would be fabulous if that salt was SEA salt. All in all, tasty, but not amazing."
4,Great starter set for a preschooler,I bought this for my six year old son who loves to build with Lego and Magnetix. He instantly decided it was a baby toy and didn't want to play with it. Once he did he really liked the idea of building this way so I bought him a big boy erector set - which he loves.When my son tossed this aside my daughter who was 3 1/2 took it and immediately started building her own creations. A year later she still loves this toy. It is a great introduction to building but does not have enough pieces to build anything large. This is great for children who need to work on fine motor skills. This would probably be best for a child around 4 years old.
1,wrong advertising,"This item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for 5-8 year olds. You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order."
1,"Pretty Bad, Wishful Thinking","One of the few disappointing stories in the Smallville Series for Young Adults, Buried Secrets introduces a new Spanish teacher who can read people's minds. She has this ability, but hates using it, and doesn't do anything spectacular with it that warrants it as a freak-of-a-week episode. Clark and Lex falls for this Spanish teacher (although there is nothing really amazing like special powers through kryptonite to get everyone to fall for her), and have Clark (who is hopelessly in love with Lana) fall for her is unbelievable. Having built up Clark's strength of character to have him go after his Spanish teacher, despite the way he feels about Lana, is unbelievable. He even gets into a fighting jealous rage when Lex falls for the Spanish teacher, too. Anyone who has watched Smallville, even for one season, knows this is nonsense."
4,an ok book,a young and pretty substitute teacher comes to town for the spanish class and automatically all the guys are in love with her. she was caught out in the meteor shower 12 years ago and it left her with the ability to read people's mind. clark falls head over heels in love but is jealous when his friend lex starts dating her. they have a few heated words and they wonder if their friendship is worth more than a pretty woman. it is not one of the better smallville series but it will do to pass a fewhours.
3,"Teitur, so smooth","Teitur is smooth and is the ideal travel pal for a car ride or for just chillin by the computer. Some of his songs has arrangements with too many studio musicians and he gets lost, but mostly he manages to keep it simple, and thats when he is the best."
4,nice,this is a must have software to keep in touch with all your friends on the move. I have it on my 6600 and I LOVE it
3,In Russell Watson's shadow...,"If I had never heard Russell Watson (or Josh Groban) I would've loved this album. Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to these much more capable singers and uses several songs that they have already done."
1,Dissappointing at best,"Kane Alexander possesses a beautiful instrument, but his album falls flat due to a lack of real emotion, and connection to the material presented. Sure the songs are quite pretty, and he sings them well; but at the end of the day it's just not enough.Some of the song choices on this album (if not all) are questionable; His duet with Tina Arena is a note for note carbon copy of the Kelly Clarkson/Justin Guarinni duet Timeless. Whoever suggested the cover of Kiss from a Rose should hold their head in shame. And I fail to see the point of singing an Italian version of How Do I Live.Kane Alexander is an exquisite singer, but unfortunately this album fails to live up to expectations and will join my collection of drinks coasters."
4,"Fun, fun, fun, for your dog and you!","What a great book about having fun with your dog. The book has very descriptive training methods, funny cartoon through out, a fun read for a fun time with your dog."
5,Unique Perspectives,"When I first sat down with Betty Kovacs's MIRACLE OF DEATH, I wasn't thrilled to read it. First, it wasn't a book by one of my author friends and secondly I wasn't sure about the topic. Then I read the first page, and couldn't put it down.Dr. Kovacs weaves emotion into the pages that will leave you gripping the book, refusing to put it down. I finished it in one sitting and was left with some new insights into life, death and the relationships between the two.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something deeper to read."
3,The Miracle Of Death,It was good and enlightening. The realm between life and death is a mystery and this book unlocks this.
2,Not an easy read,I had trouble finishing this book. It did not keep my interest. I wanted to read about a near death experience.This was more about dreams and receiving messages through dreams.
5,"The Mega Band of the new century,20000!","I have not herd or felt this kind of passion or dedication in music since,black sabbeth,led zepplin,ect.... Creed has brought home the meaning of great listing ,stomp your feet ,get crazy tunes.Dig I't.I konw that every one reading this review will appricate were I'm coming from .With there ,soulful,uplifting style. I say that Creed has brought home good feeling music.They touch my heart,soul and being.I'll be seeing them 03-02-00,in Las Vegas at the Thomas & Mack arena.this is the super group of our time.Enjoy,peace and love. jtmc"
3,Poor reproduction of some great Miller tunes.,This is a great disappointment for anyone looking for the full Miller sound. The reproduction has a tinny sound. Must of the selections have the same beat so the CD runs together and is laced with poor vocals.
3,Look Elsewhere,"Very poor sound on this disc mars the fine music. The set called ""The Essential Glenn Miller"" has most of these selections with superior sound and is a much better buy."
5,Good translation for easy reading,"I realize that the Roman Catholic (RC) Church did not give its seal of approval on the book and its Catholicity is in question. However, the New Living Translation NLT is a good read and very clear in the mind of the average American reader. It would be nice if RC scholars would sit down with the editors and make some editing possible. If the NLT could be converted into a RC study bible I believe it would enhance the faith."
1,Far from it! Save your money,"This Edition that calls it self Catholic is far from it. Yes it easy to read and understand ,but so is the cat and the hat. When reading Gods word we should find a version that is faithful to the original text. Their was many verses that where mistranslated. In the Holy book there is no room for error. Whether your new to the bible or a scholar ,there are many other translation that are faithful to the original text. There is a reason why the Vatican approves a version. If not every Tom , Dick ,and Harry would run out at publish a version as they thought fit. Besides who else would know better what translations are accurate than the Catholic Church , the one that put the first bible together and was inspired by the Holy Spirit.Remember look for the imprimatur ."
4,In search of bliss!,"The first coproduction between Rusia and Usa couldn't be more succesful. The Leningrad Kirov ballet Company, The Leningrad Choreographical Miniatures, and the unusual presence of legendary actresses such as Elzabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda and Ava Gardner two lovable children (sons of a humble woodcutter) and Miss Light, Miss Sugar, Miss Water, Mr. Bread, Mr. Fire, Mr. Dog and Miss Cat will aid them to find the Blue Bird in order to make happy a sick girl.A familiar entertainment that follows the steps of Wizard of Oz but that doesn't mean anything.Watch it. You'll love it!"
3,Unlike anything you're likely to see...,"George Cukor's THE BLUE BIRD was a monumental dud on its initial release, grossing less than $900,000. For the 28 years since it was first shown, the only way to see the film was most likely through pain-in-the-neck special arrangement with 20th Century Fox, who probably liked to think the film was never made. But now, it is available on DVD from the great RUSCICO, and last night I watched the first 3 chapters of the DVD.And let me say this-it is one of a kind.Liz Taylor sends her kids to bed early because the ran across a bridge, and then they fall asleep in 30 seconds (in broad daylight, no less) and they don't get to eat the cole slaw mush Mommy brings for them. Mommy then turns into a stoned witch and hobbles round whining about a Blue Bird.You know what you're in for by now. But it's hard to let go of the amazingly weird movie."
5,Great little mini purse,"I've had several of these mini purses for years. Love the fact that I can carry them by themselves over the shoulder - or wrap the strap around and put it inside my purse. Very versatile with tons of pockets for everything - coins, grocery buyer cards, IDs, cash, etc. Perfect size and comes in several colors - I have them all!"
2,terrible editing,"I saw Evelyn Glennie play the Schwantner percussion concerto with the CSO and it was one of the most moving and memorable performances I have seen. The reason I am rating this CD low is because of the horrendous editing job on ""Velocities."" But that's also a good reason to listen to it! If you do a lot of recording and editing, this is a great example of how not to edit. If you listen with headphones, you can hear a lot of jumpy cuts (maybe all of them). Since the piece is very repetitive in spots, you can even hear where they looped passages several times. Now I'm not against editing, just make sure you do a good job so no one notices! Shame on either the producer or editor, or engineer or Evelyn. I'm not sure who is responsible for this hack job. Especially since this recording was all digital and it is not too old (1997) there is just no excuse."
3,First book from this author,Purchased Michaels book because I like his work with James Patterson. Am not as pleased with his solo work. I found Bad Connection somewhat disjointed for me. Seemed the story felt as I was losing the structure or sense of place? Maybe its just me............
5,A crime fiction not to be missed,Bad Connection by Michael Ledwidge is a crime fiction not to be missed. A real compelling page turner.I love reading anything that sounds true-to-life and Bad Connection is exactly that.A thrilling story about a telephone repairman that accidentally overhears a business conversation that helps him make a killing in the stock market.Trouble soon follows after overhearing a follow-up conversation involving the world of finance.Some of my favorite books of fiction are that of the powerful and rich. Bad Connection is everything a wonderful mystery should be!
3,Lucky Dip of ideas with an attention getting title,"Nico MacGreif's review is spot on; ""...there are more than a few plausible ideas here. You'll just have to sift them from the seemingly silly.""Some careless errors raised doubts for me. Lawlis quotes ""anima"" as male and ""animus"" as female when they should be reversed. He also says that the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics is due to the consciousness of the observer which is not correct (see Uncertainty Principle in Wikipedia [...]).These errors don't affect Lawlis' ideas, but his casual approach may indicate that his ideas may be supported more by anecdote than provable evidence.But there's good news here for us ordinary folks. Not even the supervising psychologist for the American Mensa Society can get it right all the time, so the rest of us can certainly be allowed to make a few mistakes."
4,Informative.,This book has better helped me understand my child with ADD and am still finding alternative ways to help him using the ideas that came from this book. I recommend this book if you have a child with ADD.
2,A Little misleading,I saw Dr. Lawlis on the Dr. Phil show & it looked too good to be true. The book has many suggestions but none are fool proof and it requires a lot of parental invovlement. It also requires the child's participation. We will try the suggestions and report back later
5,Great expirience!,"First time that I buy at amazon, got what I was looking for, for an exellent price, the delivery was quick, and costumer service was formidable, sent a message with a quiestion, got the answer in no time, everithing was super duper definelly is somenthing I will do again!"
2,Difficult to read,"I was excited about the book because I saw it featured on Dr. Phil, with some real kids who had been helped by this program. I am always looking for ways to help my children and others in their school. This book, however, was not as clearly written as I would have liked it to be. The information was interesting but not in a form that would directly transfer to use with a specific child."
2,The IQ Answer needs more answers,I was really expecting a book that did more than just give a bunch of information on possible methods that may work to maximize potential. The title and authors hipe on the book made me believe that there would be some detailed information of how to implement tested theories on my child. This book provided me a small hope that there were methods available if I could find and afford a professional that could give me more details on implementation methods. I needed more answers.
4,Trustworthy,I was happy to receive the book as promised. It was in the condition that was stated in the ad. Thank you for helping a student.
3,comprehensive yet lengthy,"I bought this textbook as a required text for an addiction program planning course. The author implements his opinion throughout the book. The chaters tend to be long, and concepts are reiterated without clarity. I would have liked more detail on the biochemistry of drug transformation. I do appreciate the correlation the author makes consistently regarding prescription drugs and the potential for addiction especially for individuals in recovery."
5,Book,"My daughter, who is a nurse, is going to night college to get her BA Degree. She needed a text book and didn't have enough for it so mom to the rescue. I found Concepts of Chemical Dependency by Harold E. Doweiko on Amazon at a very reasonable price for a soft cover book and she was ecstatic so thank you Amazon.com for putting this book on your site. She was pleased and so was I."
3,Change Coming,"There's a few songs on this soundtrack that are really good, especially the song by Al Green. Aretha has a good song on here. There's some nice tracks. I really enjoyed a few songs. Then there are others that are not good at all, and I have never listened to them completely because they left a lot to be desired. It's good anyway, because the few strong songs are really good enough to make it worth it to purchase this cd."
4,Inspiring - 4.5 stars,"A truly powerful soundtrack from a powerful movie. First off id like to state to some people who reviewed this cd stating its not the music in the film. If your looking for music straight from a film then buy the score!!!! Now back on subject, ive rated each song out of 5 so you can get the overall feel (because most soundtracks are pick and choose).1- the worlds greatest - 5/52- fight - 5/53- hold on - 5/54- a change is gonna come - 5/55- aint no way - 3.5/56- sometimes - 3/57- 20 dollars - 4/58- for your precious love - 3/59- bring it on home to me - 4.5/510- Ali the greatest - 4.5/511- mistreated - 5/512- tommorow - 5/5 - UNBELIEVABLE, I challenge you to find a more powerful song13- all along the watchtower - 5/514- odessa - 5/515- see the sun - 5/5Overall this soundtrack is very jazzy and soulful. I'm normally not one to buy soundtracks but I am a huge fan of Cassius Clay so I thought id give this a try and i'm glad I did."
4,A cd that describes Muhammed Ali,"This cd has great music. It's not the best buy....but some of the songs are a great addition to your collection...for those music lovers. My favorite song on this cd is The worlds Greatest by R. Kelly, it really expressed what the movie is all about."
5,"Perfect, just what I expected","Ordered what I received,,,just as they should Be....No Surprises, No Quirks or mistakes, just great service and right on Time!!!"
3,"R.Kelly's mispronunciation of word ""ask""","I wanted to give this cd 5 stars but R.Kelly's terrible mispronunciation of the word ""ask"" as ""ax"" got on my nerves too bad. I know he's probably from the hood and all and probably has a limited education but that's no excuse for a singer who cites the great Sam Cooke as an influence. Sam would've never made such an irritating mistake and if he had he would've definetly caught it and corrected it on the playback in the studio. But- hey ! Kelly's no Sam Cooke-not even Luther can walk in those great shoes."
3,"David Elliot, son of legendary Pop/R&B Diva, Dionne Warwick","Taking on a tune by Sam Cooke is a hard task. But, David Elliot has a music background worthy of the task. His mother is Dionne Warwick! In recent years, David has been a member of his mother's international touring band as well as co-producer on Warwick's recent independently produced CDs. He also wrote Luther Vandross' ""Here and Now"" grammy winning hit. No doubt the public at large will see more of David Elliot."
2,Buyer Beware!,"I ran right out and bought this immediately after watching the film, hoping that the wonderful ambient/trippy stuff, like the theme playing over the credits, would be on here. No such luck. This is basically a rhythm and blues primer...well done, but if you're looking for the wonderful ""out there"" music that ran throughout the movie, forget it. It ain't here. Too bad too...that's what I wanted. Oh well. Live and learn."
1,This Soundtrack is just plain WRONG,"The music should have been in alignment with the era of Ali's reign, not a pop culture pseudo retrospect. What do Bilal or R. Kelly have to do with ALI as a man? The greatest injustice to me was not using Sam Cooke's original music. I understand that there were problems with rights to publication and use, but for this movie - to truly illustrate the friendship, respect and love that these two had, Sam's music should have been used. I was seriously disappointed."
3,Ali orginal soundtrack,"Buy this CD completely for the song ""Tomorrow"" by Salif Keita. It is a melodic song perfect for relaxation. The rest of the cd is tolerable."
4,"Good, but not marketed correctly","IF you are looking for a contemporary R & B soundtrack, look elsewhere. Although quite a few of the artists are contemporary, this is not an R & B album. Rather, it is a soul/neo-soul album and if I did not like soul, I would have hated this album. I mainly bought the album on the merit of Alicia Keys and R Kelly's songs since they are such great artists. The remaining soulsters are good except for Bilal. That guy is so flippin' off the wall, man. That Sh!t he is singing is terrrrrrrrrrible.So you have been warned, if you only like R & B, stay clear of this. If you like soul music, you will want to pick this up, but I will add that it is not perfect."
5,Best of Will,"This is one of the best roles Will Smith has played. When i see old videos of Ali, I think, man Will nailed it. Classic!"
3,Okay. . . .,"The quality of the DVD was very good, but we were getting bored with Bernadette's performance. It's great to be able to purchase concerts for viewing at home, especially when your ready for the concert to end, lol!"
4,Extended album versions here,"If you're thinking ""why should I choose this Midnight Star collection over the others?"", this CD won't disappoint you. I discovered 2 rewards from this album: ""Wet My Whistle"" and ""Playmates"". These 2 songs are actually longer versions that what's on their original album No Parking on the Dance Floor. It's strange how the liner notes don't even mention that these 2 songs are extended versions.Even if you have all Midnight Star's albums, you still need to get this compilation for the ""extended"" versions."
2,curvy cutter circle template,"this cutting system is big, heavy and difficult to use plus you have to use a glass mat"
1,I don't recommend this item.,"It's very diffcult to use.And cut size are not precise. I cut 7 1/2"", but cutted size is 7 3/8"" everything.And track rails are not smooth. I can't move cutting tool easily.And blade cover is very cheesy. I cut my thumb because suddenly came off blade cover."
1,Dangerously simple,This book is an unfortunate over-simplification of the decision-making processes that are necessary to properly care for our archaeological heritage. Many of the methods in this book are offered without essential caveats to guide non-professionals. Anyone applying these treatments without substantial training will undoubtedly lose information and cause irreparable harm. In addition many of these treatments have long been abandoned by reputable archaeologists and conservators alike. I shudder to think what information has been lost to the well-intentioned who are using this book as a guide.
4,Jon Stewart Needs More Screen Time,"Jon Stewart and Drew Barrymore are the reason I bought this film, but I must say Jon is very funny and cute and needs a bigger role. Drew has had lots of practice in the spotlight so give Jon a chance. He can do alot more along with The Daily Show."
1,Drew Barrymore~Primary Contributor????,"When I started watching this movie, I was begining to wonder if I got the ol' switcheroo at the video store! Where was Drew? I couldn't believe how BORING this movie was! I had to fast forward it to see if it ever got off the ground and that's when I saw a GLIMPSE of Drew and after her miniscule performance, I just turned it off! Don't waste your money/time!"
2,Drew was its saving grace.,"This film was painful to watch. Thank goodness it is done in three different sections separating the film into the stories of different characters. If I were you, I'd skip the first ""chapter"" completely and go directly to Drew's character's chapter. No wonder Drew didn't want to make this film! The only reason she was in it was because of the contract she had with Miramax. They are just using her name to sell the film. She made the best of it. And yes, she does shine on screen! Keep a look out for the black and white movie sequence in this film. Hot stuff!"
3,Love Jon!,I only bought this movie because Jon Stewart was in it.He is as always adorable.You can't help but love him.The movie was weird and Jon needed to be in it more.Love ya Jon!
2,Terrible film,"I must admit, the only reason I purchased this video was for the Jon Stewart parts. Unfortunately, there was not much to it. This movie sucked beyong suckiness, it creeped along at the slowest pace imaginable. The acting done by Jennifer Beals and James Le Gros was horrible! It has this Ally McBeal wannabe touch to it, when James Le Gros' character hears things talk to him, like the typewriter, or stairs, or toothpicks, but this is not the type of movie where that type of thing works. The whole movie is a big befuddling mess, it's boring, trite and unoriginal.And Jon Stewart did not have enough screen time, but I digress."
4,A good time for Jon Stewart fans--and most other people.,"If you want to see a fun romantic comedy, I recommend this movie. After Max (James LeGros) turns down his girlfriend Elizabeth's (Jennifer Beals) idea of marriage, the relationship takes an ugly turn. Max begins to think she is having an affair. This suspicion is strengthened by the testimony of Lena (Drew Barrymore)--who wants to be more than friends with Max--after she confirms that she saw Liz with another man. This movie is also sweetened by the seemingly small role of Jon Stewart (The Daily Show) who delivers great comedy the way only he can."
3,Drew in 1997,"If you liked Drew Barrymore in her Mad Love punk phase, than I suggest you rent this movie. Drew fans won't be disappointed, she is featured more in this film unlike her other current direct-to-video Best Men. She's one of the main characters, however this movie is told from three different characters, so you have to wait for Drew in the second act to tell her part till you see much of her. And then trust me there's no regrets. She plays a young woman who is trying to contol her destiny to get the man she loves ( James LeGros ), whose girlfriend ( Jennifer Beals ) is possibly cheating on him."
2,"P U on this one, Drew -- B O R I N G","I'm a big Drew Barrymore fan so when I came upon this movie I was pretty excited to see it...but 45 minutes into this movie I was pretty much done with it. Completely B O R I N G.Jennifer Beals is a woman with a very jealous boyfriend ""Max"" - Drew Barrymore works with Max and has a serious crush on him. She feeds him fuel for his jealousy... But it was all sooo boring I didn't care what the outcome of the movie was.I can't recommend this movie to anyone (unless perhaps you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep)."
4,an artsy creative film,This movie is very creative and entertaining. First time director Adam Park is a talent to watch in the future! Thoroughly enjoyed this film.
5,Laugh at Yourself!,"If you need a little nudge being kind, honest, or laughing at yourself...HeatherAsh is a great tour guide for a whole new world. I turn to this book at least once a season. It helps me stay balanced, and enjoy whatever comes my way. I also appreciate this book for all the great suggestions on how to bring play to those places where I am stuck, with ideas both original and solidly tested out."
4,still bumpin,"this is probalby my favorite Bootsy Album all the way through. just for the bumping funk of ""f-Encounter"" and the way the Grooves never let up. Bootsy truly put you in a good mood with his blend of funk and Groove but the cat is very versatile and I have always dug his vocals as well. the whole P-funk Army is felt on this set,but lets remember Bootsy is a Multi Instrumentalist in his own right. YABBY, DABBY, DOO BABY!!!!!!!!"
3,It's ok,"If you grew up in this time period, then you'd know about Bootsy Collins. My favorites are Mug Push, F-Encounter, and Fat Cat."
3,Broadway is sweeter...London is neater.,"If you love Chicago as I do, then you are probably wondering which version to buy. The only obvious choice is to purchase both and decide which one you like better yourself, but it is my opinion that the Broadway lacks the edge, the sheer passion that the London soundtrack so crudely, yet gracefully exudes. There is no other Velma, but Ute Lemper. There is no dispute. Not Bebe Neuworth, nor Ruthie Henshall, not even Chita Rivera compares to the brilliantly slick and cunning performance of miss Lemper. I was fortunate enough to have seen her as Velma on Broadway last April. And let me also say that Karen Ziemba is in contention to be the ULTIMATE Roxie Hart. Or maybe I am just biased. You decide."
3,"great musical, but the cd is what ruins it.","I love the musical. In fact i just saw it on broadway recently. But i wouldn't know how to compare this to the performance, because the overzealous copy protection has prevented me from playing it. Because of this, i do not plan to buy a CD or anything more advanced than a book from this site at any time in the future for fear of this problem arising again.I hate you, copy protection."
3,O.K. Performance,"Chicago is one of my favorite musicals to listen to -- I have yet to actually see on the stage, but after seeing the movie and listening to that soundtrack and this soundtrack, they are very different, like I knew they would be.First of all, Bebe Neuwirth has AMAZING talent and was the perfect Velma Kelly. Her rendition of ""All That Jazz"" was great, as was ""I Can't Do It Alone."" She is one of the best actresses to play in this role.Ann Reinking (Roxie Hart) didn't do it for me. Her voice was so raspy and I didn't care for her song, ""Funny Honey of Mine."" She spoke the words way too much. When she did sing, her voice was quite good and I only wish that she had applied it to all of the songs she sang.Joel Grey was a great Amos Hart. I simply love Joel Grey in general. He's an excellent actor.All in all, this was a pretty good performance, with some flaws here and there."
4,Very nice,"This is a very good recording of a hilarious musical. I have seen the touring production of the show, and this cd captures the humor extremely well. This cd has a great cast. Bebe Neuwirth is very funny as the lovable looser, Velma. Ann Reinking is at her best as Roxie. And James Naughton is unbeatable as the lawyer, Billy Flyn. Supporting cast, including Marcia Lewis and Joel Grey are great. Buy this cd first and after you have listened to it, buy the newer london cast to complement it."
5,Chicago is the best soundtrack ever!!!,"I introduced this soundtrack to my friends at school and they all loved it! My best friend and I LOVE ""All That Jazz"". Also we all especialy LOVE "" The Six Merry Murderesses"". I bought this Cd when it first came out and since then, it has been played so many times that the cd stoped working! So i bought a new one! It was totaly worth the investment!!!!"
2,CHICAGO VOCALLY DISSAPPOINTING!!!!,"After listening to this soundtrack, I thought one thing. That is that the dancing in this show must be amazing because the singing sure isn't. Just goes to show that much like movies today, broadway is willing to award accolades based on production values rather than content. I believe that it is vitally important that Ann Reinking pass on the Fosse style to another generation of dancers, but whoever is letting her sing should be shot!Bebe Newirth is fantastic as always, but after hearing her on other recordings, one has to wonder whether the affectations she uses to make her voice sound 'sexy' are helping or hindering the cause.If your looking for great singing and a tuneful broadway score try Candide (1997), Sideshow (1997), or even Titanic (1997). These are all feast for the ears.....Chicago is merely an appetizer."
1,Get the MOVIE soundtrack instead,"I was introduced to this exceptional musical thanks to the incredible film version currently in theatres... I purchased this to hear the cut songs... which are interesting - but it really isn't worth it.This wreck features the worst vocals i have ever heard on a CAST RECORDING. The chorus is a joke. This stands out on the destroyed ""Cell Block Tango"" amongst other group numbers. As Velma, Bebe is a cute novelty - she's just okay. As Roxie - Anne Reinking is tragic - she destroys the show, and at the age of at least 90 Joel Grey is a pathetic choice for Roxie's husband. Stay far away from this album (just download the cut songs) and purchase the beautiful Chicago FILM soundtrack!"
4,Great Production,"I saw this show at least 10/15 times while it was in LA and loved it. The CD was great to except for 1 song--Mr. Celliphane. The guy in LA was just sooo much better in that song. Still all in all, Buy the CD"
5,Chita And Gwen are still #1.,"This is an excellent recording. Bebe N. is vocally perfect for ""Velma"" and Anne Reinking is very similar in voice to Gwen Verdon, the original ""Roxie."" The 1976 cast of Chicago is available on CD again and Chita Rivera does the definitive performance of ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango."""
4,Very Good,"This is a very good sountrack because Chicago is a very good musical and the cast is excelent, but I prefer the London version with the great Ute Lemper as Velma Kelly.Anyway, a very good choice."
4,Hilarious!,"I'm a diehard fan of the B'way traditionals: Miss Saigon, Les Miz, etc. Thoguh I don't think any musical can match them, it's good to hear something that has comic relief. I saw Chicago on Broadway and was very excited when I picked up this soundtrack. I liked Bebe Newrith, but after seeing the phenomenal Ruthie Henshall in her role Bebe is nothing. Ruthie also puts Ann Reinking to shame in her OLC of Chicago. But Ruthie aside, I liked Bebe, though Ann wasn't that which I dream of."
2,Chicago Shot Down!,"I bought this CD in hopes of an awesome recording of Kander and Ebb's ""Chicago"", but what I got was less than mediocre. When I hear Bebe Neuwirth as Velma, I don't picture the sexy night club singer/murderess, but Bebe singing like Bebe. Ann Reinking plays Roxie Hart....She tends to speak (quite gravely and breathy) throughout many of the songs which is very disappointing. On the other hand, James Naughton is perfect as Billy Flynn and Joel Grey is great as Amos Hart. Mr. Grey doesn't over do the singing as he usually does, but is perfectly in character. The orchestra is good as are the orchestrations/arrangements. I would have rated this CD higher (based on the performances of Naughton and Grey), but Bebe and Ann sing so many of the songs that I couldn't find much enjoyment in it. I actaully gave this recording away, hoping to find a better one... wish me luck!"
2,Disappointing,"Having just recently seen chicago and liked it, I decided to buy the cd. Unfortunately, I found that I liked listening to this show far less than I had enjoyed the production.Definitely see it if you get the chance, but I'd pass on the recording."
2,"Good, But Not Great.","The revival edition of CHICAGO could be a whole lot better (like the original or the movie soundtrack.) But it is good none the less.Bebe Nuewirth is fun to listen to on the recording, but Ann Reinking is HORRIBLE! She can't sing and she can't act as well as Ms. Nuewirth.I recomend this recording to all Chicago and Kander and Ebb fans."
3,Not quite as promising as appeared at first glance,"The book is beautifully presented, with interesting illustrations, and the treatment of various famous Victorians seemed promising at the outset. Yet, overall, the book is not of the quality I had expected. Facts are not treated in sufficient depth, and are presented with a narrow perspective.Whether in an attempt to gain sales or just a nod to current popular obsessions, the over-emphasis on sex is quite boring. Everything from schoolboy novels (supposedly covert treatment of masochism) to Lewis Carroll is based on sexual matters, and too many motives are blamed on subconscious sexual frustration."
4,Old Pornography-lovin' Codger,"I'm one of the the above 35 fans that still follows the Cure. To be honest, they started getting spotty after The Head on the Door album, to me. So, this DVD is totally worth the price of admission if you're into the Pornography album. This group plays it with just the right mix of tension, emotion and musicianship. The light show for this set is perfect, too. The other two highlights are the two encore tracks from the Kiss Me album.Both Disentegration and Bloodflowers drag a bit in spots to me. They could probably both be paired down to 8 songs each, like Pornography, and be better off for it. That's been the biggest problem of the CD age....albums are too long and bloated just because the space is available. Anyway, these are also undoubtedly fine live versions of both of those records."
3,didn't hold my attention,"I have been a fan of The Cure for almost 20 years. I have all their cd's and many imports, I was kinda disappointed when I bought this DVD, I found it very long and not to exctiting. Don't get me wrong The Cure is very entertaining, but I enjoy The Cure in Orange and Show much better then this one. He seemed to have less energy onstage in Trilogy. But over all I think it is great if you are a die-hard Cure fan. I do love them, but not this DVD. This is just my honest opinion!!"
5,The best DVD ever of the CURE,"The Cure Trilogy is one of the best dvd's of the Cure's performances & song Catalog.I love this DVD. If you are a Cure fan you should invest in this DVD you will not be disappointed !!! I am also happy with the Vendor that shipped me this DVD , the packaging was GREAT !!! & it arrived very promptly --Thank you Again I will definately order from this vendor again"
4,"Good transfer, great performance",This is a GREAT performance by The Cure. The BD itself has a decent to good picture quality and the sound is EXCELLENT.
4,not expecting perfection,"As a few of the other reviewers stated, the visuals of the DVD are not particulary engrossing. however, it was a recording of concerts they did actually play, and i found their performance on the DVD to be very similar to seeing them live.I did not find fault with any of the songs - i never expected them to be studio perfect. the imperfection of the performance gave the impression that the band is just human after all.what i did find particularly interesting was the commentary. i love getting a ""sneak peek"" into the minds of my favorite people.I truly enjoyed this DVD and am very happy I bought it! I'd recommend it to any Cure fan!"
5,At last - for fans,"I'm sure many fans have been asking for an official live recording in dvd format from the cure, and this release fills all their (and my own) expectations. Rob himself has prepared this wonderful document of live cure and standout albums performed live, perfectly by the current lineup.There's very few complaints as it's a wonderfully done dvd release. Only complaint i have is about the PCM soundtrack that has too much echo on it at times and the vocals sound quite bad at few points. However, one can skip to the 5.1 mix that has been done well, even if one is using a two speaker system. Well done the Cure, Now you must release In orange and Show on dvd to document the other two best cure lineups this far :)."
5,CureHead paradise,"The best part of this DVD is the performance of The Kiss - the last encore. While the Pornography set burns, Smith gains momentum through the course of the concert. His creative fires are sizzling by the time we reach Bloodflowers and just explodes through the encores. The Kiss has always been one of the Cure's best concert pieces, but this rendition is over the top. I don't know about people who aren't Cured, but CureHeads will definitely love this one."
3,Good but...,"I HAVE to begin by saying that I REALLY REALLY MISS BORIS WILLIAMS DRUMMING!!! Jason's drums sound like cardboxes. I think everyone will agree with this.Also Roger doesn't play the Disintegration set with the original or close-to-the-original sounds! Listen to Disintegration, Closedown or even better Lullaby! the keyboards doesn't sound right. The great Homesick is screwed by both, Jason and Roger."
3,Cure,The Cure trilogy was good. My main criticism is that I had to pay additional Customs charge of 12.95 (approx 20 US dollars). Thi Ther was no indication that this had to be paid in addition to postage.
4,I learned a lot,"I want to learn about being a magazine freelance writer and this book was very clear and succinct. It gave specific advice with examples from magazine articles written by the author. Unfortunately the age of the book has made it outdated and I came to amazon looking for an updated version. It talks about individually typing letters as opposed to photocopying, because it was written prior to the computer age. It discusses using the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature for research that can now be handled from home with an internet connectin to the library. This makes me wonder what other information is missing or too outdated to be useful. But the basic advice on the mechanics of writing articles was very clear and easy reading."
4,Nice performances and story,"Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson do a fine job of playing son and father, with the former showing his love and devotion after his dad falls ill, and the father, before that time, showing his acceptance of his gay son and a refusal to let anyone else make him feel ashamed of it. A very sweet and sometimes sad story with nice locations in Sydney, Australia."
4,A love story between a father and a son,"Would that either of my parents had loved me this well. Yes, Jeff is gay! But that's not the story -- the story is the relationship between a young man and his father.If you love the gay ""tones"" in the film, fine. If you don't, fast forward thru them, but you owe yourself the opportunity to watch this father / son relationship."
1,Yuck,"This is on the level of a gay after school special. Its amazing that so many reviewers gave it a high rating. Very simplistic/trite/boring story. The acting wasn't great it was average. And the talking to the camera was ridiculous. The make out scene was gross. RC isn't believable as a gay. Boy I bet he's sorry he made this now that he's thought of as such a womanizer. Definately skip this, especially if you have a mad crush on him. All your dreams will be destroyed!"
5,"If you want to know Crowe's genius, see this movie!","A very heartfelt story! This movie is living proof that love is a universal emotion. Jack Thompson and Russell Crowe showcase their brilliance as dramatic actors with a comedic heart! This movie will have you singing along, make you cry, make you laugh, it will twist and turn every emotion in your soul. One of the earlier Russell Crowe films that all must see for all to realize his sheer genius as an actor who is willing to explore all boundaries within a character. Superb cast overall!"
4,"""nice"" film","No, it's not about a ""son and daddy"" relationship (you know what I mean). It's about a single father and his (real) son - and the amazingly supportive relationship they have! This movie was fun to watch (you'll figure out the part I didn't like involving the father). I remember being charmed by the love displayed between the two men, and the humerous ""prodding"" the father does to try and get his son a nice boyfriend. Fun movie."
4,"Tolerance, but with a lot of honey","This movie promotes tolerance, respect and love for sons, but unfortunatly some scenes are overacting, so many ""sugar"". I recomend it."
1,The obvious in exquisite detail.,"On page 52 you will find Mr. Turvey's suggested Case Assessment Form, with such items as; 1) Victim Name, 2) D.O.B, etc. On page 53 you will find the Case Assessment Form Instructions; 1) Enter victim's name, 2) Enter victim's date of birth, etc.This book comes complete with a handy Glossary. Examples of definitions, ""E-mail, or Email: A service that allows people to send electronic messages to each other"", and ""Stab Wound: An injury that is the result of being pierced with a pointed instrument. The depth of the injury into the tissue is usually greater than its width on the skin"".This is the recommended reading for Mr. Turvey's online course. Enough said."
2,Criminal Profiling??!,"This author uses a rather casual style filled with the author's own biases as it relates to criminal ""profiling."" To the casual reader this textbook leaves out several historical facets to criminal investigating. Also, it leaves the reader questioning what are truly the qualifications one must possess to be a criminal ""profiler."" The author has a history in ""profiling"" that is up for questioning by several legitimate forensic agencies and professional societies--read at your own risk.Opinion only."
1,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money on this book. As a professor of Criminology, I found Mr. Turvey's approach to be quite juvenile in it's theories. Mr. Tuvey's analysis often contradicts itself in following chapters. I advise my students that there are far better books about criminal profiling on the market."
2,I agree with the criticisms of the author,"The author is a bit condescending in his writing style. He is very clear that HIS way is the ONLY way, and he never shies from insults. Clinicians who practice using a Freudian model are ""voyeuristic,"" and anyone who has an interest in this subject must prove themselves in his method or else they're just morbid and disgusting people who have watched too many movies. Maybe he forgot he came into this field too.There are a few useful things in here, but I'm sure there are much better books with a more neutral approach. I found the author annoying and unfunny."
4,Extremely Funny,"If you watch the movie, you will love the soundtrack. The songs are so funny. All the songs are mostly pop and 80's pop. You can definitely sing too...There are no high notes or low notes. It gets boring fast but hey, it's really funnny.."
4,Kinda cute,"Ok, they do a great job recreating the 80s pop style with Hugh Grant giving it his best send up of George Michael/Flock of Seagulls/etc. The real star is ""Cora,"" who perfectly creates with considerable talent, flair and poise a Pop Princess who can actually sing!Over the top at times and strictly for fans of the film, but fun and well produced."
5,If You like the movie...,If you like the movie you will love the soundtrack.All of the songs on the cd are sung by the people from the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music.
5,Music and Lyrics,"The music is beautiful, the actors are the greatest, I love ""Pop"" and ""Way back into love"""
3,Wham pop that fades fast,"The opening track Pop! Goes My Heart is the album's highlight as is the corresponding music video that opens the movie. Meaningless Kiss is another Wham-like jingle that amuses though the rest of the album consists of weaker material. Some of the lyrics are very 'Spinal Tap'-like, which is great if you like that style of humour."
5,Fun and Heartwarming,"I just watched this and it is awesome. I didn't know Hugh Grant could sing, and he is great. Lots of fun, and ups and downs romance wise, but I could watch it again!"
3,A Must-Have for Hugh Grant Fans!,I bought this CD because I just loved the movie. I love Hugh Grant and was pleasantly surprised to discover that he does his own singing on this soundtrack. The other songs are fun (especially Buddha's Delight) but this soundtrack is not for everyone. Its best suited for those of us who love Hugh Grant.
4,Seriously.....Where Are The Lyrics??,"I was disappointed that the lyric's were not included in the CD fold out. I had to go to another web site to get them. I know I can't sing, but I like to understand what they are singing! I only really liked half the songs on this CD. I agree with some of the other reviews, that we got cheated out of some good songs from the movie. I did buy ""a used-like new"" CD, so I still feel like I got the basic's of what I wanted. Now if I can just figure out how to program OUT the ones I really don't care for!"
1,audio cd copy protection ruins an otherwise fun soundtrack,"Love the soundtrack. Hate the audio cd.Because of copy protection, the audio CD can't be played in a computer. Will be returning the CD and using the credits for the MP3 version."
5,M&L Great Soundtrack,"I love Listening to the Soundtrack of the movie. It feels like you're in a love affair with someone. I love listening to mostly every song. My number one favorite song out of all of them is Pop! Goes my Heart. I want to get that Soundtrack along with the movie so that I don't have to watch the movie and then get the Soundtrack. My Former British Boyfriend Sir Hugh was so Naive and I read in Wikipedia that Drew Barrymore, Hugh Grant, and Haley Bennett did they're own singing. I would barely Listen to it over and over on the songs I like to Listen to. I also have them on my Ipod. I feel so great and I was taking it well."
3,The movie's soundtrack,Nice CD covering all the music in the movieI would've liked to have the video clips incorporated too :p
3,A Missed Opportunity - Where's All The Music and Lyrics?,"Although the music included on this CD is enjoyable, the disc is woefully short in length. The soundtrack clocks in at just under 39 minutes which, by today's standards, is very short. There was much more music in the film that could, and should, have been included on the CD. For instance, where are the ""music and lyrics"" to the two great songs prominently used in the movie's closing credits? America's ""Work To Do"" from their latest album ""Here and Now"", and another Haley Bennett tune entitled ""Invincible"" are glaring omissions on this disc. The consumer got seriously short-changed on this one."
5,Question more than a review,"I can't really add much to what has been said here. I am curious if anyone knows of others songs written by the songwriter(s) of these heartfelt, poignant songs? I'd love to explore more of this music no matter who sings it, though I would love to see Hugh Grant, and Haley Bennett do more."
5,really good loved it,hugh grant and Drew are just perfect singers and songwriters. they could do this insted of acting if they got tired.
2,slow delivery,"I had to wait a lot longer than I was originally told, when the cd would come. I loved it once it came."
5,Amazing Album- Exactly What I Wanted!,"Duty, Honor, Country: Those three hallowed words reverently dictate whatyou ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. This album captures theimportance of these three axioms so very well. The soldiers/musicians whoperform on this album are proud service members who use their God giventalent to inspire, uplift, and entertain. Never in the history of thisnation have we needed to remember these three ideas more clearly. In thecomplicated and trying times of the modern world these ideals will see usthrough. If you need excellent and inspiring music to see you through theday, then this album is a must have. - From the well known West PointMarch to the title track each song brings about the imagery of greatsacrifice and struggle to preserve what our great nation stands for. -If you love military music or are just a true patriot like myself this albumis a must have. Another awesome album by the US Army Field Band andSoldiers Chorus is God Bless the USA."
2,You'd be better off reading the constitution online,"I'm a real constitution buff and wanted to get a book that was a great reference for the constitution. The book was obviously not it. Basically I paid for a scaled-down version of the Constitution with very very basic interpretations of the amendments and articles. The fourth amendment is explained in three lines. There is no thought put into this book, hince it's only ~60 pages, with about 10-15 pages used for credits and table of contents. If you're looking for a copy of the constitution and only need the basic version, get online and print it off any site. Don't waste your money getting this book."
4,"An interesting read, but not a devotional book.","My main gripe about the book is that the introduction makes it seem like this is a book of devotions. It is not. Most of the interviews are taken from the (Christian) HM magazine column ""What So and So says"" where secular stars are interviewed and approached about thier beliefs in God and Christ. The responses are interesting, but not necessarily spiritual.By far the best interview is the one with Alice Cooper. As a long time AC fan, I bought the book mostly for this one interview. This is the first time (to my knowledge) that he really discusses his conversion experience (He doesn't want to be a 'celebrity beleiver'). It is AMAZING! He is very open about his faith and he reasons for staying in the secular music scene. The book alone is worth reading this rare interview!"
1,this sucks,"This book is not musicians talking about God. It is transcripts of interviews about bands' various tours, political committees, and other bland topics like their family upbringing which hardly mention God at all. It's as if once in an interview the interviewer will ask, ""oh yeah, what do you think about God?"" where the rapper or ""musician"" responds, ""don't know him really."" Or with the Rage interview, albeit a talented band, an interview by them includes support for the moral relativistic killing of unborn life (they even support partial birth abortion as a ""choice"") and playing the race card does not belong in a Christian book.This book is a joke. It's just useless text and cheesy, hokey-isms instead of true, meaningful conversations by secular or Christian artists about God.Don't waste your money."
4,"I love The Waltons, but ...","None of the 4th season discs are labeled with disc numbers. Thus, if you get them out of order out of the boxes it becomes a guessing game as to which disc is which. It takes a special kind of stupid to omit such a vital detail - kind of like forgetting to put page numbers in a novel.That said, I still have to give this a 4-star simply because it IS The Waltons."
5,The Waltons,The Waltons series are always good/clean entertainment. I bought these for a gift for my Aunt. She enjoys them after coming home from work.
5,The Waltons ROCKS!!!!,"The DVDs are brand new and in perfect condition - the content is exciting, heartwarming, and fulfilling. Fantastic collection to have and to share!"
3,Disappointing,"I have read other books by Suzanne Enoch, but this was not one of her best. Lucien's hardness toward his own family is not that well explained, and there seems to be some mystery hinted at about his cousin James that never materializes. Alexandra spends most of the book pushing Lucien away. Then it seems she DECIDES she's in love with him instead of really FALLING in love with him because she still keeps refusing him. Frankly, I give Lucien many points for persistance.I will continue to read future books by Suzanne Enoch because this is not a bad book, I just have come to expect more from her stories. KCS"
3,started off good...,"I loved the Hero, he was fast on his feet, his quips were laugh out loud funny. In the beginning I liked the h but the further into the book I read the less I liked her. The H deserved better, it is doubtful an Earl of that time period would have put up with her attitude, or her constant rebuffs. By the latter chapters I found myself skimming here and there just to get to the end."
3,Reforming a rake,"Reasonably clean Regency with a believable and lovable Hero. Story seemed too drawn out though, and there wasn't much conflict other than the heroine's own misconceptions about herself. The most significant character arc in this story was the Hero's, and it was the Hero who figures out the problems holding the heroine back. Actually, because I really liked the Hero in this story, the heroine was a just bit too wishy-washy/meh. Lucien deserved better.Not one of the author's better works."
3,3 stars for Lucien,"I absolutely hated the heroine in this book and reading the reviews I find myself in the minority.. I read these 5 star reviews about how much reviewers love the character(s) and it amazed me. Of course different strokes for different folks. The author did a great job with the hero, he was witty, funny and just plain outrageous but by the middle of the book I wanted to bounce a rock off his head for trying so hard to please this unpleasant woman. I will try this author again because I liked Lucien so much but if you can't find something to like in both characters you might as well give the book a pass."
4,Reforming the rake indeed!,"I loved the witty banter between Lucian and Alexandra. I lived the fact that she wasn't intimidated by his title and told him exactly how she felt. The only problem I had with this story is Alexandra was too stubborn for her own good. Other then that little complaint, the book was great"
1,Wish I could give it zero stars,"I wish I could give this book zero stars because it is just a total waste. The more I read, the more disgusted I got with these silly characters. They have no depth, no common sense, and no intelligence. I kept trying to struggle through it, but finally quit when I was not too awfully far from the end. It just wasn't worth reading the last few pages."
3,It was just ok.,An ok book but I got bored and wanted to find a new book to read before I was done reading it.
2,Unfortunately more than disappointing sound quality,"The Oistrakh / Gauk is my favorite recording of Beethoven's Violin concerto. Another reviewer suggests that the sound quality here is the best we can expect from Soviet era monaural material. I've owned and enjoyed various LPs of this performance, usually in simulated stereo. These all adequately filled a room with the incredible performance by Oistrakh. And the sound from the orchestra was adequate. On this CD, the orchestra sounds like a small band, so compressed is the material. The violinist comes through, but just barely. I've wondered why they bothered to transfer this to CD with such an incredibly bad result."
2,In desperate need of a remaster,"If you don't know the story of Deep Purple, I'll make it short and just say they are one of the greatest and possibly THE most influential metal band of all time. Now, on to this actual disc, out of the hundreds of CDs I own, this has by far the WORST sound quality of any of them. The music sounds so washed out. It's completely unacceptable. Do not purchase this."
4,FYI...,"... a more complete Deep Purple compilation on the market is the 4-CD ""Shades 1968-1998"". I bought this one myself, but I have ""Anthem"", ""Bloodsucker"", and ""Anya"" elsewhere. ""Shades"" only has the latter one, so it's not really complete, either."
5,Boyfriend LOVED it!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentines Day, and he absolutely LOVED it! The robot dances and is geeky and awesome in the best possible way. He wears it frequently. It came in a timely fashion, sealed, and it a very cool fossil tin. I am completely satisfied."
4,Perfect Groomsmen gift,I bought five of these for myself and my groomsmen at my wedding. The ability to synchronize the dancing robot is pretty key. They remained in sync across a few days. Unfortunately it is not a replacement for a second hand.
5,Best tools ever!!!,"I came across these wrenches as I went to change the headlights on my 2007 Hyundai Sonata. Actually, I tried a bunch of tools and after many tries with all sorts of tools, I just could not get this nut loose because of the angle and tight crevice I could not manuever my hand into. These tools changed my life. It made that job so much easier. I've used these wrenches for so many other things and I am just amazed at how easy everything is. Props to the guy or gal that invented these."
2,Okay reference book.,"Not much light is shed on the themes in this account. Virtually no real info on Initiations and the meanings and uses of the Sabbats. Kinda shy on areas such as Sex Magick, Binding spells, Group Rites, etc. A standard clean version of every topic and definition. Boring to my tastes."
2,Not up to her usual standards,"Usually, I like this author, but this book seemed flat. The story wasn't engaging and it felt rushed or something. She has a large number of books out, so maybe she was in a hurry to finish this one."
2,Out of date,"This book was written in 1984. For a current take on legislative drafting, search Amazon for ISBN 1587330156"
3,Last longer than expected!,"These are expensive but they lasted longer than I thought. My dog loves them too...still think bully sticks are better, last longer and are a little cheaper!"
1,Perhaps the most misleading book on ethics ever.,"A famous and influential book that is almost entirely wrong on every count. This book set philosophical ethics off in the wrong direction for over 60 years. The combination of non-naturalism and intuitionism makes ethics actually quite impossible. But do not despair, Moore's famous argument against the so-called naturalistic fallacy is just so many pages of begging the question. Of historical interest only."
1,Huh?,"this book is a staple among the clever clogs chattering classes, even though he mis-spells the word ""shown"" at least a hundred times. The prose is terrible and I had no idea what he was talking about.Verdict: Ivory tower rubbish."
5,BUY THIS PACK!!,If I could ever give anyone one piece of advice for hiking it would be to get this pack. It's perfect for day trips and holds just enough water for a 7 or 8 mile trip. It has three compartments 1. for the water 2. for clothes and supplies 3. for misc items. I am seriously impressed with this item and it has served me well on my first thirty miles of hiking with it. The water pack is very durable and can take a beating all while staying sealed perfectly with no leaks. The one thing that I didn't like was when I received it I noticed that the black/green was interesting but the green is neon green and it's only the stitching. In fact it looks awful but with some patience and a permanent marker I fixed it and you can't even tell it was ever neon green. So seriously think about buying this pack I promise you will not be let down.
1,This DVD has got to be a joke,"This is not really a one star DVD, it is really zero stars. The costumes and stage design are the most ridiculous I've ever seen. Be warned!"
4,An Important Israeli Writer,"Ronit Matalon is one of the most important young writers in Israel today. She is passionate and humane, and refuses to be sentimental or cliched. it's a shame that the only other review of this novel ignores the greatness of Matalon's humanity and doesn't bother to consider her novel's literary and political merits. 'Bliss' is not a novel that is emotionally 'easy' in any way -- it not only confronts the contradictions of political and national identity, but also the tensions of love. It does this using crystalline prose and an a-linear style that forces the reader to be actively engaged in the novel. Though her first novel, 'The One Facing Us,' is more theoretically daring, I recommend 'Bliss' to anyone who accepts that politics and love are too complex to be represented as ""us"" or ""them,"" ""black"" or ""white,"" ""with us"" or ""against us."""
2,Sacred Ground,"Unfortunately, I fell in love with another of her books.... ""The Dreaming"" and thought this book would be as interesting.I did try.........but gave up 1/3 of the way through it. Someone else might like it......we all have different tastes. I gave my copy to the library.Frances J. Jessup"
3,Predictable ending,"The historical chapters were interesting. However, the contemporary story did not fit because it was too predictable and reminded me of romance novels (unrealistic fantasy). I also felt this book was a way of convincing readers that Native Americans are wrong and ignorant to insist that sacred artifacts, etc. be removed from museum displays. Museums can make replicas which will also serve to educate the public."
5,Great Book,This was a wonderful book - a real page turner. Barbara Wood has done a lot of historical research and woven it into a beautiful story.
4,Barbara Does it Again!,"How often do you get to read a book by your favorite author about the area you live in?! Although the wait between Barbara Wood's books seems long, when you read one, you understand what takes so much time. Her research is meticulous. I love the juxtaposition of present and past. Barbara always creates strong women who inspire us to make a difference with our lives. This book is important because it reminds Californians of the struggle that went into creating the state we know today. Barbara also reminds us that we all came from some place else and we all have mixed blood. Now, how to pass the time waiting for her next novel..."
4,Sacred Ground by Barbara Wood,I enjoy reading books by Barbara Wood. She makes them intersting and educational about the area she is writing about. This was different as she writes about the medical profession. All are interesting.
4,Kindle Version Review,"Another great Barbara Wood novel. The kindle version seems to have many minor word errors that must be caused by a computer transcribing system. Although they are minor, they are a bit distracting.I think the stone that appears in this book is a common theme throughout all of Barbara Wood's novels."
4,"Pretty, Poor Quality","When I got this I was amazed at the speed of the shipping and beauty of the item. It truly is amazing :D My only concern is it broke the second day. When I got it, there was a hole in the pendant and the string is made of weak leatherishness. But if your gentle, this is definitely a necklace you want to buy. I'm not upset that it broke, because it's so beautiful to being with. :D"
1,Poor Craftsmanship!,I orginally purchased this for myself when it was $10. As soon as I received it I went to put it on and it broke right away. I was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for $10. I went to put that one on and it broke as well. I was never able to wear the necklace even once. I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!
1,There are no words...,"I couldn't believe how fake and cheap this item looked once I received it. The cord which looks black in the picture is also brown, and very flimsy. The item looks WAY better in the picture than it does in person."
1,Frightening,Like nothing I've ever seen in nature or man-made. Very loud and rather like alava lamp stuck in mid-burp. If Ellen had a uglest jewelry contest this would be a good entry. Creepy. My reaction was -- they can't be serious?!
3,Yeah great for a 12 year old,Price says it all. Maybe nice for a child 12 years or younger but not cute on an adult.
5,Amazing!!!,Amazing necklace!! I bought it for myself and was amazed when it came in. I showed it to my husband and my friends and they could not believe that it only cost me 3.99. It goes with everything. Thank you so much!!
2,Disappointed,"Bought this for a gift. With the suede necklace, it looked nice. Then it arrived. To my surprise the Amber Stone was HUGE! I mean really large. Bigger than a dollar coin.The person claimed to like it, but I have my doubts. Never seen it worn."
3,Nice,"This product is surprisingly pretty. It's not the real thing, and has a tad fake quality to it, but I wear it with red tops and it really goes well."
1,The dark side of the zone,"While it is true that one can meet many interesting and fun people while playing bridge on the zone, there is a dark side which isn't talked about in the book. Many people form relationships that should not be made as they are already married. I speak from experience as my 70 year old husband of 27 years became deeply involved with another player on the zone and decided he was in love without ever meeting this other woman. We are now getting divorced. I believe people should be cautious. Playing around is not always a good thing, certainly not when it destroys marriages and breaks hearts. Ironically, she- the other woman-has given this book a rave review. What she called Fun I called heartbreak."
2,"Small, thin wired.","I bought this so long ago I don't remember if I knew about the wire, but it gets in the way a LOT. Much more than my traditional mouse used to. I was hoping (I think) that the smaller wire would be plenty easy to keep out of the way - sadly, not so. Also, the mouse itself is QUITE small - about 50% the size of a normal mouse, which means after long periods of time on the computer, I'd just as soon use my touch pad because it becomes aggravating/slightly painful. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Excellant low cost/size mouse,"For the price, I don't think you can beat this mouse. I bought mine for use with a notebook, but after using it and loving its small size, have decided to get a couple more for my desktops! My desktop mice seem so large and clunky now! My mouse picks up perfectly from any surface, unlike another review here!"
1,My ears are bleeding,"Why Why WHY???? The nicest things I can say about SJP's performance are: ""Gosh, she sure was...loud."" And ""Gee, she got the words right."" Just another unfortunate example of B'way punking out and choosing a star as their lead to fill the seats rather than one of the hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of 'no-name' leading ladies waiting in the wings, chomping at the bit awaiting their Big Break. Sigh.Another nice thing I can report is that upon studying this performance I know what NOT to do when I direct this onstage. Thanks, SJP!"
2,A recording that pales beside it's predecesser,"Alright, this recording is of better sound quality than the original, but the actually singing simply pales beside the orginal. Sarah Jessica Parker sound like a rock next to Carrol Burnett. The rest of the cast is not too horrible though. The best songs are the chorus songs, with the exception Sensitivy."
2,Sarah Jessica Parker CANNOT sing!,"I'm sorry to rate this so low but SJP is horrible. I cringe every time I hear her bark her way through ""Shy."" Please take my advice and get the old recording with Carol Burnett. She far surpasses SJP in talent, both musically and artistically."
4,Great Show!,"Sarah Jessica Parker really shines in the lead role. This production of OUAM is a nice update on the original Carol Burnett version from the 1960s. It's a pity that it didn't last longer on Broadway, but shows like this (nice but not terribly flashy with sinking ships, flashing swordplay, or big animal puppets) don't seem to have the impact they used to. At any rate, I recommend this CD most highly for anyone who is tired of all the glitz and flash most Broadway musicals now have."
2,Forgettable,"Saw the show. Unimpressed to say the least. Parker doesn't have the vocal chops for a role such as this. Patti LuPone, yes, as well as many others who can actually shake the theater with their voice. The soundtrack is ok. I took the cd and removed all the solos by Parker and replaced them with the songs from the original. Made my own best of compilation. If you only buy one version I would go with the original."
3,great if your trying to complete a collection.,just trying to finish a collection. Great if your into cartoons of this time line. I like the robot Zeta. other than that no big deal
4,Swades - great film,"The acting was a little cheesy at the beginning and when the movie took place in the US. But in India, I thought there were several good themes. Poverty, discrimination, injustice, romance to name a few. I liked watching how ShahRuchKhan's character changed as he visited his homeland."
3,"Space efficient, but some limitations","Clever design is space efficient. the ""control unit"" is only 6x2x2"" with all the amps actually located in the Subwoofer.So you do not need an extra shelf for the receiver.I used it in ""front"" surround mode with the 2 center speakers moved to the center and the main and surround speakers stacked on each other on each side of the TVSoundstage has good width. Sound is decent but size of speakers limits the ""richness"".The biggest problem was that the decoder did not handle the different TV sound broadcast modes well. I hooked my DVR to the unit via optical cable and the unit handled sound from the HD 5.1 channels well. But it could not handle the stereo from either digital or analog channels via this hookup. I could switch to 2 cable RCS hookup from the DVR--but then you lose the digital 5.1 encoding from the HD channels.And while the unit is compact there still are quite a few wires to deal since all 6 speakers have to be connected to the subwoofer/amplifier."
3,Yeah for Kindle!,"I'm very glad to see this nursing textbook available on the Kindle so we can save a few trees. I wish more textbooks were. That said, it's a huge rip-off for the publisher to charge so much for the Kindle edition when it doesn't cost nearly as much to produce and distribute and the authors certainly don't receive any benefit. This is a required text for me and it's only the beginning of the semester, so I'm not ready to comment on the content yet."
2,Poorly written to maintain interest,"I just finished graduate school abd leadership was a big topic. I saw there were many good reviews of this book so I bought it because I am promoted into a leadership job, but it will not be any more useful than a web site. DOn't waste your money."
5,Great Product,The shoulder strap pad is just what I needed! It's reversible in that you can change which side of the strap you can put the 'high' side.
2,"Cumbersome, doesn't really serve much purpose","I bought this to go with my new Domke shoulder bag, and used it for a month-long trip through central Mexico. After a month of traveling with this shoulder pad, I'm ready to throw it away. It's too heavy and cumbersome.Perhaps that's partly because it does it's job too well. There are times when I want my bag resting on my hip. Other times, I want to push the bag behind me, and out of the way.I found myself constantly adjusting the position of the shoulder pad to accommodate a simple 2-inch adjustment in bag placement.With a much heavier bag over my shoulder, I might find this pad to be more useful. But if you're just carrying a standard camera bag, don't bother."
4,Works Like It Should,This pad alleviates the discomfort of the Domke shoulder strap digging into your skin over extended periods of time. I'm a little surprised Domke doesn't just include this shoulder pad with all of their bags and slightly increase the upfront cost. Who doesn't like comfort? This pad is easy to attach & remove...should be capable of attaching to non-Domke equipment just as easily.Recommended for those of you taking your Domke bags out for long hikes and walkaround shoots.
4,Alternate Use,"I'm actually pretty happy with the padding on my existing camera bags (mostly Lowepro and Tamrac). I do use it with one fairly large bag that I load up to carry on trips, and it does help a SLIGHT bit, but everything is relative. A heavy bag is still a heavy bag.However, I thought I'd try using this pad with a guitar strap. This works great for that purpose. Even heavier guitars like Les Pauls seem lighter with this pad, even during longer playing sessions. I'll probably buy a couple more for this purpose."
4,nice pad,"This is a very comfortable and well-designed shoulder pad. I use it for a messenger bag that didn't come with a pad. The padding has the perfect consistency to prevent ""digging in"" -- as one poster mentioned, the rubber pad does ""shed"" a bit, kind of like a pencil eraser, but it's really no big deal -- I rubbed it on my jeans for a few seconds when I first got it and that knocked off most everything that might have ended up on my shirt in the future. I use it cross-shoulder, and the angled cut of the pad is perfect for this, but I'm sure it'd be pretty comfy hanging straight down too. The plastic backing looks rigid in the photo but it too is very flexible, though it spreads the load of my bag's thin strap nicely over the whole pad.All in all, a good buy for this price and I'm glad I chose it over the other pads available on amazon."
1,Didn't last for me,I bought this for an overseas trip to carry my DSLR and 2 lenses. The backing came apart from the foam on day 3 and by the end of the trip completely unglued. Poor quality.
4,Saves My Shoulder,"A good product that has a lot of padding to protect my bony shoulder from other, more narrow straps from cutting in to it. Recommended."
4,Good accessory,"This is a nice add-on. Personally, I think it should come with the bag. Works well, keeps bag from sliding off of shoulder."
3,"comfortable, but no support","I gave this bra 3 stars because it came in a very hard to find cup size (F). I am very particular...and this one had the underwire, seemless cup, and larger cup sizes. The major drawback is that the fabric is far too stretchy to give much support. It is a very comfortable bra for lounging around...just needs more support."
3,Doesn't fit very well.,I don't really recommend this for bigger busted women. The construction is a great idea but being a size F . . . it didn't work for me.
2,Never received this item,"I never received this item, although it was supposed to be replaced as the wrong DVD was sent originally, it was again replaced with the same wrong item. Maybe because the price went up!!"
1,Nope,"I would like to thank these folks for showing me what a one-star DVD looks like, because I've never ranked anything that low before. Now can I please have a refund?Realistic, probably. But not funny. Realistic in that life is, as its most boring, this. But I have better things to do than watch it."
4,DVD quality sucks,"I love the series but the quality of the dvds is bad and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. If you havent seen it and can appreciate Britsih humor at its best, quirky and subtle, then you will love it, otherwise you're wasting your money."
3,You get what you pay for,"Performs the basic functions but some of the features don't seems to work all the time. The big issue is if you have a mountain bike with shocks, the mounting is a real pain. Also, the range rating from the sensor to the computer is a MAXIMUM. Mine would not work if I mouned the computor to the handle bars, had to mount done on the crossbar, makings it difficult to see while riding. But this issue is probably because of the way I had to mount the sensor because of the shocks. I will probably end up buying a different computer in the future."
1,got dried old leaves,"i thought they would be giving fresh neem leaves, they shipped dried leaves which were of no use. So it was literraly throwing my money down the toilet."
2,"Great Stuff,But Everyone Must Have All The Songs On It.","This is just a rehash of Deannas material that all us collectors have.Its Foolish,But Its Fun,Always,Cant Help Singing,Spring In My Heart,One Fine Day,Its Raining Sunbeams,Amapola,etc are all great tunes and nobody does it better than Pretty Diana with her Golden Voice,but how many times do they want us to buy them?The soundtrack to Up In Centeral Park lies in the vaults.Go Figure.Someday, someone might release it.A lot of Deannas great tunes from The Eddie Cantor radio show would make a great CD.Who wants to keep buying the same songs over and over again?"
1,How does someone who can not sing get a recording contract?,Lupillo sounds like a drunk trying to sing in the shower! He is awful. If it were not for the band there would be no music! The band would sound good if Lupillo did not distract from their music! Don't waste your money!
4,'Electric Sugar Cube Flashbacks' - Various Artists (Bomp / AIP),"Worthy compilation of 21 different psych, garage and pop bands. A few are better known acts, but most are lesser known artists. All if not most of these tracks have been mastered off of a 45 vinyl, but rest assure the quality is still very decent. Cuts I thought more than carried their own were the Smoke demo for ""My Friend Jack"", Skip Bifferly's ""On Love"", The Sweet's ""Time"", the foot-stomping Big Boy Pete, with ""Cold Turkey"", Marmalade's ""I See The Rain"", Dave Clark Five - ""Maze Of Love"", The Kingsmen with ""I Guess I Was Dreamin'"" and Opal Butterfly's (Hawkwind's Simon King's first band) with a very clean mix of ""My Gration Or?"". One of the better various artists releases I've encountered in sometime now. A true keeper. Great cover, don't you agree?"
2,"Earnest, but uninspired","I listened to Ms. Veda's music because she is the proverbial ""friend of a friend of a friend,"" and I confess I was disappointed. While she is clearly trying her best, and has good instrumental backup, her vocals are weak and lack a certain passion. The material is also fairly derivative of much we have heard lately, and she gives the impression of coming in a step behind the trend. Still, her voice is smooth and shows promise. I have heard worse, and I give her 2 stars for effort."
3,Too Much of A Good Thing,"As always, Bocelli's voice is magnificent and his execution impeccable. However, the violin accompaniment throughout the album is tedious. Mixing it up a little would have provided some relief. This is a great album for the classical enthusiast but disappointing to someone wanting to enjoy Bocelli's splendiferous romantic crooning."
1,"Poor Andrea, trapped by a bad producer","I love Andrea Bocelli, don't get me wrong...but his last two albums have had such poor production values and musical arrangements, I'm jumping camp to Russell Watson, Josh Groban and Mario Frangoulus. What's the matter with his producer. Two annoying violins on every track, stingy orchestration and a bad choice of material. What happened to the lush and full sounds of Sogno, his best CD ever. Andrea, please fire these people and find a new arranger and get someone to pick some better musical selections that allow your voice to soar and you to shine...too much talent being ruined by bad management and production."
3,Not a good Bocelli cd,I think the interpretations of some pieces were very bad. ALthough I think the choice selection is very good. Get Romanza and the one that was released before this one.
5,Sentimento,I always love Bocelli and this beautiful opera album is one of his best. The London Sumphony Orchestra is on this album and there is a lot of violin music. It is beautiful and soothing with the first song being in Spanish. The rest are Italian. No one can sing opera like Bocelli. This is a great addition to anyones opera collection.
2,So-so Ry,"I love Ry Cooder, but this one ain't all that great. It was during his phase that was more R&B than the acoustic blues that produced so much of his best work (e.g., Into the Purple Valley, Chicken Skin Music), & is not really his best work in this vein either. For this sort of thing, you'd be better served with Bop Till You Drop."
2,Guitar Wizard Takes A Break,"Ry Cooder is a guitar master with a unforgettable slide-quitar technique. Unfortunately, his virtuosity, the assistance of John Hiatt and drummer Jim Kelter can't save Borderline from mediocrity. The album starts off with a hell raising bass driven `634-5789': the soul backup singers do a stellar job with the chorus, and the guitar work is inspired. Unlike `634-5789,' it's all downhill from here. The nine remaining covers are poor choices for Cooder's and Hiatt's guitar attack, much less the emphasis on ""doo-wop"" chorus work (Joe South's `Down In The Boondocks' is barely recognizable). File Borderline with Eric Clapton's There's One in Every Crowd, or under ""Guitar Wizard Takes A Break."""
5,'Christmas Time's A-Coming',"It sure is, and this is another one of my favorite Christmas albums! What a treat, I thought I'd be listening to Emmylou Harris, not betting on Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton to boot! Their harmonies are just plain glorious! I love all the songs on this, especially ""The Little Drummer Boy"" and the title track, ""Light of the Stable""! Recommended!!!"
5,She captures the spirit of Christmas beautifully.,"For the past two years, LIGHT OF THE STABLE has been the first Christmas music I've listened to. Just hearing this album instantly puts me in the Christmas spirit. ""Christmas Time's A-Coming"" starts the season off beautifully. The versions of ""O Little Town Of Bethlehem"", ""Away In The Manger"", ""The First Noel"", and ""Silent Night"" sound as if they're being sung by angels. ""The First Noel"" is sung without instrumnetal backing, in beautiful harmony with the Whites. ""Beautiful Star Of Bethlehem"", ""Golden Cradle"", ""Little Drummer Boy"", and ""Angel Eyes"" are equally gorgeous. ""Light Of The Stable"" is one of my favorite Christmas songs. One listen to this album will put you in the spirit of Christmas. You won't regret buying it."
5,Outstanding reference for freelance Makeup Artists,"I'm an aspiring makeup artist. I live in Phoenix Arizona and couldn't find anything on the subject of freelance styling as I want to do makeup for music videos and fashion shows. When I found this book it changed the direction of my work, helped me set goals and taught me how to find the right photographers to test with. It's invaluable and I recommend it to anyone who says they want to get in the business. Also, it has great resources and now they have a website at: setthepacepubgroup.com"
2,An attractive book that could use more substance.,"While this book is a nice coffee table photo album, the content and text leave me wanting for more words, insights, and revelations, with fewer photos. The photos are nice, the overall book a little lacking in true substance. Nothing new seems to have been presented to the reader besides the photos, and the discussions about the discovery of Mallory's remains in 1999 reflect the fact that Breashears and Salkeld, while well known in their fields, played no role in the 1999 expedition and have no special insights from it to share with the reader. Not bad if you want the background on the earlier 1920's climbs, but Salkeld's other book, The Mystery of Mallory and Irvine (recently released in a new edition in the UK) does a much better job of filling the reader in on the topic than her treatment of the subject in this picture book."
4,GREAT INTRODUCTION,"I had some limited knowledge of the Mallory expeditions prior to reading this but not much. This book was a great read for me as a novice climber/historian due to my limited knowledge. Although someone who is very familiar with the subject matter may not appreciate the book, I found it to be an excellent source of information and extremely interesting to read. The photos are incredible and let you get a feel for what the author is talking about. If you are looking for the actual photos of Mallory's body clinging to the slope however, they are not here. Just what I found to be an honest, up front, and informative read regarding the whole Mallory and Irvine riddle."
3,Title of the book is misleading,"I have only recently taken up reading books on Everest. Of three so far, this was the least pleasing. ""The Last Climb"" does an excellent job of describing the history and background of the early expeditions to Everest. However, it does not do the title justice in that when they describe Mallory and Irvine's ""last climb"", one is left unmoved and far from gripped. There speculations of the fateful day also appear very narrow. The book is lavishly illustrated but to me was more of a history text than a good read."
5,Wowza...a must have book,"Being an avid gardener (along with most others of similar mind) I have shelf after shelf of instructional type books that are excellent resources. But for unbounded inspiration, delightful eye candy and the occasional chuckle the Garden Gallery is stupendous. It was one of the most refreshing/inspiring reads I've had in quite a while. No toneless, college professor dialogue about how to do what, when and why. The conversational, witty tone of the written word coupled with stunning photos pull you into George and David's luscious gardens. Even though this isn't a how-to book, they provide more than enough background information on plants, hardscape and the like to encourage/inspire you to create your own Eden. I read the book in one night and was saddened when the last page was finished and the back cover closed. Felt like an enchanting and fun visit with newly found friends had ended much too soon. This is certainly a must-have addition to your gardening library."
5,Exquisite,"I saw a program on this garden on HGTV but had no idea that there was a book! I was not disappointed. Visually beautiful as is the garden and inspiring for a gardener like myself. I want them to come and work in my garden, but the book will have to do. Like dessert w/o the calories."
5,My arms are free!,"I like backpack type cases, whether for computers or cameras. It leaves your arms free, although you have to put the pack down to get things in and out of it. It holds my DSLR with a lens on it and three other lenses, including a very big 80~200 zoom. It has plenty of pockets and places to store things, and the tripod holder works very well. I also like the handle on top that lets you just pick the pack up and go.Full, it's quite a load to carry, but I think I'd rather have it on my back than slung over my shoulder. However, it's hard to say whether this pack is the one for you. A shoulder bag is easier to get things in and out of, and a belt pack is very convenient if you only need room for a few items."
3,Roedelius / Schnitzler - 'Acon 2000 / 1' (Captain Trip) 3 1/2 stars,"I had sort of forgotten about this limited-edition (of 1,000 copies) Japanese import CD, seeing that it's been out awhile now. Seventeen tracks (each are untitled) to fully experience here, with each song averaging four minutes in duration. Disc clocking in at 61:10. Not a bad piece, but I believe that the K/Cluster completists will obviously get the most out of this experimental / electronic Captain Trip release. Although 'Acon 2000/1' does have it's moments, it's definitely an acquired taste. I haven't gotten anything on the Captain Trip label in sometime now. Guess I should check out their site. I encourage you to do the same - as they often put out some fantastic CD's that you cannot find anywhere else."
2,a beginner's handbook,Katherine Merlin has written a handy small book about the psychology of the birthchart. I can hardly find anything psychological in her book and find her interpretations superficial and not indepth. Everything you can find in this book you will find it in another book too. If you are looking for real insightful astrology you should not read this book.
3,Know what it is,It's a good book I guess if you have a 70 foot liveaboard sailboat. I have a 26 foot weekender an found very little that was of any real use to me.
2,Not sure about the durability,"YMMV, but my 80GB drive died after 6 months. I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home, but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of. I'm glad I back up my data in more than one place."
5,Great Accessory!,It is Great! It's small and easy to use. Starting out was no problem for someone not computer savvy. I just plugged it in and started loading it. Transfer/recovery speed is pretty decent. The only thing I might recommend is a sleeve or something to keep it from getting scratched up. I'm extremely happy with this product.
3,Not a bad drive,"Well I had the original drive for one day, and it went dead. So I had to call WD and get it replaced. It is an ok drive, I was not really impressed with it. I had looked at them in the past (store suggestion), but did not buy one.Not sure how much use it will get, I purchased it for a different reason.With the first one dying, I had to rethink what I wanted it to be used for. I guess it will be good for a short back up, or a drive to carry files around when I can not use a thumb drive."
1,Mac Mini USB Can't Power It,"I plugged it into my Mac Mini and it shut down all USB ports on the machine, and the monitor. After some fiddling, found it was drawing too much power and the Mini shut down the entire USB bus.I've seen an Amazon review saying the 60GB version *does* work on someone's Mini... so maybe it's just the 80GB one, or maybe it's my Dec 2006-era Mini."
4,Solid performance; Some quality issues,"These are great devices once you get working ones. I bought my developers these units for backing up their work. The first five we received all erred and gave us errors, including power errors that WD's Support cases were useless for helping. Eventually worked with WD Support and they determined we had five faulty drives. These are apparently laptop hard drives placed into some nice casing and there have been quality issues with some batches.Once replaced with a new batch of drives, all have performed well and members of my staff that use them rate the Passports with high marks. No requirement for external power is especially useful for some. Since our purchase, I've discovered one of my vendors uses 30 of the Passports to carry and deploy images for their training PCs. They have had similar experience with a few bad drives, but once they got working ones, all works well. It is their primary mode of deploying environments for training, now."
1,Waste of money,"Sorry to be negative. I bought altogether 5 of these for myself and fellow workers. The USB port problem is intermittent on all our Dell Inspiron, Latitude etc., but so irritating that I'm going to trash them. Plus I look like an idiot for buying them. They were engineered fine for higher current USB ports - not intentional I'm sure, but the marketing teams don't seem to care about business ethics. They should come up with a fix and regain market trust. I'm going to someone else - and am angry."
3,Caution to desktop users.,"I bought this to use as an external backup drive for my desktop computer. It's very plug-and-play, so it needs no setup time--just plug it in and it's ready to go in an instant. Drawbacks are that the USB cable is extremely short--only about 8 inches long, and there's no on/off switch. The short cable might be fine with laptops, but is a problem for my tower. I ordered a longer cable ($9 direct from the manufacturer), but the longest one still is only 21 inches long. The lack of an on/off switch means I have to tie up a front USB port (the rear ones are too inconvenient to reach) if I only want it running occasionally."
5,A great external hard drive!,"So far - so good! Works great, was easy to use the first time. Yes, the cord is short (as others mentioned) - but it sits nicely on my computer when it is plugged into the USB port on my computer. As for a case - the Nintendo DS case is PERFECT. I'm delighted others suggested this."
3,"Good drive, but I needed an extra cable to power it","Good drive, worked well for me AFTER I discovered my laptop could not power it from the USB drive and got the cable I needed. It would have been nice to have been warned about that. (The very short instruction manual says you MIGHT need a power boost cable if your USB port doesn't supply more than 500 milliamps). I tried to buy the cable, but no one had it nearby. I lucked out that my boyfriend already had one. But what a pain...at that price, it should come with the cable."
1,Needs another cable,"""The WD Passport hard drive requires a little over 1000mA of power at spin up"" says the WD troubleshooting website.Why no mention of that here or on its product page? My usb drive provides 500mA so I need another cable. Extra cost and extra delay. What cheek.I advise you to check what power your usb port provides before ordering this."
1,Not Recommended,"This product draws power which MOST of the computers (both desktop and laptops) do not support. Even though the manual (which accompanied the product) states that it works with all (except a few PCs). I tried using the cable that would split the power to 2 USB ports and still it did not function. Why does the Company not provide the cable which would work with ALL the PCs.Any one opting for this drive please be aware of the power problem before purchasing, neither your PC states the power USB provides nor the manual of the product highlights this problem.VERY DISSAPPOINTED"
4,Pretty artwork,"This is of the sort of picture book I call ""dreamy"" - no real storyline, very calming, perfect for bedtime. (Most ""dreamy"" books ARE bedtime books, in fact.)The polar bear leaves his mom, sees that all sorts of animals are sleeping, sees the northern lights, and goes back home. Not much of a story, but you don't read these sorts of books for the story, you read them for the illustrations (which are very nice) and for the calming effect and homey feelings."
4,Lovely Book,This is a good one to read when your little one is settling down for the night. Colors are just right for that kind of moment. This is one with which to snuggle under a nice warm blanket.
3,Please don't hate me for this....,"Please don't hate me for this, I swear I'm really not a bad person who secretly hates fuzzy little bears and loving bear mommas. It's just that this book left me kind of cold, and it's not the effect of the snow. The story is nice, some of the phrases are downright lyrical. However, the total look of Polar Bear Night (New York Times Best Illustrated Books) is not enthralling to its intended audience looking for a sweet, pleasant, pretty book to lull them off to dreamland.There was little to no interest paid by the child who saw this book, and this is a child who loves every book she sees, sometimes carrying them around the house all day.I'm sorry, but.... ehhhh. This purchase, based on other great reviews, was a mistake. Live and learn."
5,Inspirational,This book was just what I needed to inspire me and get me started tapestry weaving. The instructions are clear and the color photos show exactly what to do. I would recommend this as a good book to start you off right. I enjoyed the project and after I finished it I felt confident I could take off on my own. The gallery of pieces at the end of the book is beautiful.
5,Excellent Book for Beginning Tapestry Weavers,Excellent book with detailed instructions and wonderful photos. It makes beginning your tapestry a piece of cake!
5,TOP MOVIE,"When a deadly assassin hijacks a passenger train, he threatens to detonate a deadly can ofpoison that can wipe out an entire city, if he isn't given a 25 million dollar Ransom.While the cops are attempting to thwart the madman,they decide to call Former DEA agent Paul Blake (Antonio Sabato, Jr)the one man who can possibly stop the fiendish plot.Also starring Australian Actress Kimberley Davis.Great photography,shot in Queensland Produced By Antonio Sabata Jr is a fun pictureDirected By Ever Reliable Brian Trechard Smith.Highly Recommended."
2,Felidae's Filmation-style Felines,"Outside of the fantastic dream sequences, the rest of the film's animation quality is only slightly better than Saturday morning cartoon fare. You can't compare it to Disney/Bluth, even Disney _TV_ animation is better than most of this film. Some of the secondary character designs leave a lot to be desired as well. There are cats that look too much like bears or dogs. The main story plots are also told in a most uneven, almost offhand way which can be partially blamed on the bad dubbing in the English version.Be that as it may, it is a brave film and kudos to the studio with the guts to take on the subject matter of Filidae. I'm hoping the original German version is uncut, because the English version looks like it suffered from a hatchet editing job."
5,Mother of liver transplant recipient.,This is a great book with useful medical information about the transplant process as well as a heart warming account of the struggles of waiting for an organ donor and receiving a liver transplant. I could hardly put the book down after I started reading. Emotions and events are described so well that you feel you are part of the family and therefore part of the journey.
5,works as described,installed a tankless hot waer heater and used this for the propane switch so never run out of hot water during a shower
4,"good solid, trek read","I really liked this book. Alot is going on on many fronts and sometimes the story can get away from the author and the reader and a good idea can just turn into a bad read. Everything was handled nicely in this book. An alien invasion, a planet begging the federation for help, the enterprise taken captive. It all sounds rather busy but the author does a great job of keeping the reader interested and not going too far with things. The ending seemed a little 'neat' (kind of like the tight little solution of your average brady bunch episode..lol), but I think the book was executed well. Dvorkin obviously knows these classic trek characters which is always important when delving into a trek book. Good stuff."
4,A good read but slightly dramatic!,I enjoyed reading this book and I do think that the author has managed to centre more of the action around Pine Hollow. However considering how much has happened to the girls it would be perhaps more realistic if more time had passed. I thought the end to the book was really sad. However it is true that even in real life you can go from happy and excited to miserable and depressed. Still I can't wait for the next one.
3,riding to win,"In this book, the Saddle Club finally gets a chance to compete at a major horse show. Carole's doing well, but will mistakes from her past come back to undo everything she's worked so hard for? Callie is receiving unwanted attention from another Pine Hollow rider, but she doesn't know how to tell him to back off without hurting his feelings.I really wish this series had some positive male characters. They're all either too possessive, or becoming an alcoholic, or just downright creepy. Oh well."
1,whats up,"all the new saddle club books are on love or romance. what happend to horses? if you like romance, these are good if you like horses, try thoroughbred. I love the old saddle club books because they were about horses. the new ones are missing somthing.ACTUALLY THEY ARE MISSING EVERY THING."
3,What inthe world,"what's going on?this is a totall mess! it's like one big soap opera. everyone'sso depressed and stuff it's sick.what with Carol grounded A.J. becoming an alcoholic at Sixteen""! get real! and what's with Lisa's mom who do you Know who's 40 year old mom goes out with a 25 year old college student.Thing's would be alot better without so much TRAGEDY! Lisa's mom should be happy lisa's not walking out on her like her fatherdid!"
5,TV Classic Family and Series,"As far as I'm concerned, this series ended when Richard Thomas left it after five seasons. When you watch the first four seasons, you understand why. People can make all the fun they want to with ""John-Boy"" but Richard Thomas and his portrayal of the oldest Walton child made this show was it continues to be -- an unmatched television classic."
5,Totally great sneaker!,"I highly recommend these sneakers. They are great for walking(shopping etc., and also for treadmill and eliptical workout.Also, I no long experience back pain when walking or standing for long periods. These sneakers are great!"
5,Happy Feet,"These are the min shoes I wear and I love them! Very comfortable with great support. I purchased my first pair in 2008 and have been wearing them ever since. They are great for walking, exercising and anything else I do."
3,ok,I had to send these shoes back because they did not fit my feet. they are made very well but everyones feet are different and these did not fit my arch support.
3,WRONG SIZE,"I ORDERED SIZE 11W, THEY WERE TO BIG MY FEET MOVED AROUND IN THEM, SENT THEM BACK AND ORDERED A SIZE SMALLER AND THEY FIT GREAT, LOVE THEM THEY ARE LIGHT AND NOT HEAVY LIKE SOME THAT I HAVE GOT, ENJOY WEARING THEM."
3,U should C Q - its OK :) A good B movie,"Ive been watching this film for almost 30 years and still enjoy it. I love the monster, Q the flying serpent is really cool. Some cool gore scenes , but nothing to disgusting. I thought this was a well done B effort just before the Jurassic Park SPFX boom. It is not scary at all, but if you like monster movies, this is worth checking out. The acting is fine especially by Michael Moriarty. this was a remake of sorts of the Flying Serpent an early black and white movie also worth seeing.. I own both :)It didnt do well enough for a sequel as the ending of it made it seem like it could happen..AS for the DVD - get the Blue Underground version, slight improvement over the non OOP Anchor Bay DVD"
3,Excellent Transfer & Sound but.........,"this DVD edition features a new commentary track by Larry Cohen and Bill Wastig(?) but once again Blue Underground fails to either subtitle or close caption the film. It should also be pointed out that at one point Bill states that Q looks rubbery and Larry states that the bird was always secondary to him.Since Stop-Motion Animator David Allen is now deceased I'll paraphrase his comments about his work on Q.He was originally told the creature would only be seen in shadow or at night and therefore while creating a great armature he didn't waste time or money on detailing the skin or feathers.Much to his chagrin the footage he recieved was all shot in broad daylight.So while he was always proud of the animation, he was apologetic that the audience got to ""see"" as much of the model as they do in the film."
4,Q-The Winged Serpent,"I haven't seen this movie for a long time and was surprisedto see it available on DVD. I think this was a TV movie, not sure.Quality of the DVD is very good. Plays in Full Screen modeMovie is about a large winged reptilian Serpent that attacks people ontop of tall city buildings. Someone finds where the Serpent is located inthe City and the city law enforcement has a battle with it in the end.The plot is pretty good and the monster effects are good also.Makes a good late night movie to watch."
2,BEWARE! This version DOESNT have the original ending!,"ANCHOR BAY DOES IT AGAIN! THEY GOOFED! With Anchor Bay famous for restoring cut scenes, for giving you bonuses like alternate ending or deleted scene, I was HORRIFIED to see that despite the new widescreen transfer, they failed to restore the original theatrical ending! When i saw this at the theatres, the film ended with a message telling you what happened to Michael Moriarity's character. BUT when it came out on MCA videos and on Showtime, the message scene was cut out.But when it played on HBO and CINEMAX, and syndicated TV, it was in. So I figured Anchor Bay will restore it, but they didnt! So if you still hvae the old cable, or even the syndicated TV print, DONT ERASE IT!"
2,"Neither horrible nor actually good, ""Q"" is just sort of ""there""","This is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 New York (there are generous aerial views, lots of location shooting, etc.) than as a horror movie, even a cheesy one. The special effects are used extremely sparingly, with the word ""special"" being a definite overstatement. Some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings, but not by much. In the end, ""Q, The Winged Serpent"" is watchable and certainly not horribly bad, but it's hard to imagine this being anybody's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure. To end on a positive note, the DVD features a clean, sharp print of the film."
3,Jungian Self Development,"Pregnant Darkness is a powerful guide to the inner lifethat helps in the inner work of unity of the mind,body and soul.Using Jungian psychology and alchemy images and terms,one learns to travel deeply into dreams and create selfunderstanding and unity. With perseverance as you get usedto the language and process in the first 3 chapters,this book becomes a meaningful guide. I bought the Jung Lexiconby Daryl Sharp and A Dictionary of Alchemical Images by LyndyAbraham to assist me. For the true inner seeker this book is aimportant guide."
1,Terrible!,"Absolutely laborious to read. And when you do finally manage to wade through it, you find that Fox and Miller fail to ever reach a conclusion by adequately describing this elusive concept of discourse. Indeed, the last chapter is entitled ""Nascent forms of Discourse""! Where is ""Successful forms of Discourse""? Not in this book!"
4,"Dude, The Return of Candlemass","Not that they were really gone, but this is the Candlemass that I have always loved. Messiah sounds so good on this disc. I missed him being in the fold. I originally ( back in the `80`s ) found his vocals a bit over the top but then I grew to love `em. I wasnt too impressed with the bands latter offerings but this was a pleasant surprise. I dont think that they`ll ever top the classic "" Nightfall"" album but this is great nonetheless. If you miss their classic sound then by all means get this disc. The Metal Historian approves......"
2,Hmm.. not the Candlemass I was expecting...,"Candlemass is one of my favorite doom metal bands, with dark doomy lyrics that makes you want to cut yourself.. I've been waiting a long time for Candlemass to put out a new album.After purchasing and listening to it with high hopes, I was very disappointed. I'd have to completly agree with the other dude that rated this CD with 3 stars b/c it REALLY WAS NOT the Candlemass i was expecting. If you were looking for doomy lyrics like Epicus Doomicus Metallicus / Tales of Creation you'll be very disappointed. I felt that they have lost their doomy edge and have become another generic washed up band. A lot of the songs on this album sounds like they tried to bite off their past CD's with failure. I also think that Candlemass has run out of ideas and put out this album for the sake of putting something new out.I'm crossing my fingers for the next album to be a killer one!!"
2,Try a different album,"I like candlemass a lot, but there are two good songs on the disc, Black Dwarf and Witches. Everything else seems like your generic power metal, which isn't why we like candlemass. Give me the sludgy doom, not this. I feel like this was them attempting to tweak their sound....and failing miserably."
2,Plods along like a dinosaur,"This CD starts out good with the song ""Black Dwarf"". A cool riff and a fast pace. Everything after that is boring. Dull, blunted riffs and meandering song structure. The singer has a weak voice but tries to sing in a bombastic style so every word sounds like a strain. ""Candlemass"" plods along like a dinosaur until it just runs out of energy and is over. The production is ok and musically the playing isn't bad. Everyone just sounds tired and like they didn't really care. A big disappointment."
5,Extremly funny light fantasy in a modern context!,"A series of shot stories relating the adventures of a deabeat linguist and his two centimeter demon, in their disastrous efforts to help others (for a profit of course!). Well written woth surprising twists, this porvides it's cost wort hin pure intelligent entertainment"
5,A charming book,"What a delightful collection of stories! Isaac Assimov is a master of science fiction and I have enjoyed books such as I, Robot and Fantastic Voyage, but I have never gotten such a chuckle out of any book as I have out of Azazel. The miniature demon, forever concerned with arcane details of his own world (where he is an insignificant creature) and his master, George, a good enough fellow if you pick up the check, are more vivid to my mind's eye than many far more masterfully drawn characters. Add to this Assimov's dry humor and his ability to poke fun at himself, in the person of the perpetually unappreciated narrator, and you have a book that, while it will not move your soul, will certainly warm your heart."
3,A fantastical collection of stories.,"Mosst of the stories in this collection are intriging and most are a bit on the dark side. Asimove is one of the true Grand Masters of sci-fi, but these stories are not quite (close), to his usual high standards"
4,Great - 4.5 stars,Not a full five stars because stories were too short. Otherwise thought there were great.1) Perfumed Heat - Love the idea that a werewolf would be in the perfume business. Also a great concept of a were mating with a full blooded wolf. I really like the were/full interation in these stories. Artemis Gray - widower / werewolf catches the scent of Belle and the story is on. Belle is human (well maybe only 85% human). 59 Pages.2) In the heat of the night - one of Artemis's cubs Kearnan (a fully adult were) is a wolf researcher. Serena is a werewolf striking out on her own (actually running from an almost arranged marriage). Serena is going into her yearly heat cycle and Kearnan is ready to make her his own. Really enjoyed both of these stories. 121 pages.
4,MSc in crop prtection,"I am university professor in Colombia I give classes of entomology, fithopathology and biological control. Also I make investigations in biological control in pest and diseases"
1,I wonder if the studios ever read these reviews? Guess not!,"Wow! I get the feeling Volume 1 & 2 releases of a single Season on DVD is NOT popular! As a collector myself (and owner of Seasons 1 - 3 of Paladin), I totally agree. One day, the studios will REALIZE that to SELL DVD's and STOP PIRACY - they need to QUIT PROMOTING IT! Greedy idiots! Basic economics - Price determines sales! Especially on NON essential items."
1,Passing until pricing improves,"I, too, have decided to pass on purchasing this half-season. Doubling the price after such a long wait sends the wrong message to me. I am a capitalist and understand the need for profits, but withholding a product from the marketplace is no way to generate sales. I'll continue waiting."
3,Here we go again!!!,"I am a huge fan of this series, and have seasons 1-3 and was eagerly awaiting the release of season four when lo and behold... they got the ""partial season"" greed bug.I am still awaiting the last half season of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea(and will we ever see completion of The Big Valley or Cheyenne????). This really makes a lot of we viewers CRAZY mad! Talk about greed. What are these studio guys?.... Wall Street hustlers?!I'll bet a lot of fans seek out good boot-legged copies.Far-from-gruntled viewer"
1,Passing on this one.,Love this series. Richard Boone is one of my favorites and he was excellent as Paladin. I own the first three complete seasons. I have waited years for season 4. Now it is here and what do I find but a total betrayal of the fans that bought the first four season with an overpriced release of a half season and no expectations of the rest of the season to be released anytime soon. Passing on this one until it is done right.
1,"I agree, corporate greed at its finest !","I bought the first 3 seasons, but I too will wait till later for a complete season 4 ! Similar thing is happening with Lord of the Rings on Blu-Ray. It is being put out soon on the regular release, but will be put out much later for the extended release.I've also been buying the Monk DVD's, they run around $35 per season. Now they have all eight seasons out in a complete set on eBay for around $75 ! So I paid $280 for 8 individual boxes, more than a $205 difference!"
5,"One Of TV's BEST. And I, for one, am VERY thankful that it is obtainable!",".Five stars! Five stars for what it is...Five stars for the content. Five stars for the fine stories. Five stars for the clean, crisp pictures. Five stars for the clean, crisp sound. And five for the packaging.Oh, and five stars to CBS/Paramount for producing this quality series on DVD.If you paid out your hard-earned cash for the old Columbia House tapes, you'd be correct in your disdain for them--now there you're talkin' ""overpriced"" and ""rip-off.""These new DVD releases ain't them!Also, five stars for Amazon... because frequently (like today) they have very nice sales on some good DVDs (like ""Have Gun-Will Travel"").Happy viewing(s) everyone! :-)."
1,Attention Paramount etc...,"The series needs no review per say (a classic)...As I've written in the past, my one star reviews are generally for the half season releases at inflated prices...Paramount's (and similar other companies) implied and prevailing attitude to or about the consumer is something of this order...""Go ahead and complain, but as long as our cash register is ringing, we'll keep releasing half seasons at inflated prices. Much more profitable than releasing complete seasons at lower, competitive pricing."" ""Thanks for buying and making our day.""My understanding is that Gunsmoke came to a halt because sales tanked. Consumers have said enough is enough.Consumers have made it clear they prefer complete seasons and reasonable, competitive pricing.Paramount (and others) could be raking it in big time if they followed the above simple formula.It would seem their marketing people should be axed, due to incompetency."
5,Just thankful for Season 4 and Vol 2 coming July 6,"Have Gun-Will Travel Season 4 Vol 2 comes July 6th!!! Yes, I wish they would not split the seasons but I never thought we would get Season 4 after years of waiting. CBS Paramount, please give us Seasons 5 & 6 so we can have the whole set of this special TV show of TV's golden age.We are too close to all 6 season's to quit now"
1,Not This Time!,"I own all three previous season (complete) releases. I loved this show as a kid when it was on TV. I have a personal policy that I will not purchase TV shows that have been sliced into multiple volumns because the studio(s) want their pound of flesh from consumers. This will be no different. While I would love to have the fourth season, I cannot justify paying full season prices for only half of a season. So, as far as I'm concerned Paramount might as well have kept this goodie in the vault and not bothered to release it. If I eventually see it cheaper (as in at least half the whole season price) I'll consider buying it. Until than, forget it. Sorry Paramount!"
5,ITS WORTH IT,I am so glad I did not listen to the whiners. I bought v1 of season 4 and it was worth every penny.I can hardly wait for the next volume. Have gun is a 5 star show that deserves 10. Nuff said.
1,Rated: Too Expensive,"I own the previous sets. I won't buy this one because of the obvious rip-off. Folks, these shows were in the can and written off long ago, and hence the cost to bring a full-season DVD to market would only be marginally more than a ""Volume"" approach, and yet we are expected to pay double! I can view very high quality versions of all these episodes online and even download them from a multitude of file sharing sites. While I prefer to encourage the studios to release more titles and invest in extras, etc., this is like a slap in the face (or more like a 1-finger salute). Don't encourage them. Stay away. It's your hard-earned money at stake. After the whole season 4 is released, buy it used (in new condition) on eBay. Do to the studios what they are obviously trying to do to us. Vote with your business - it's the only message they'll take seriously."
3,$30 For Half a Season!?,"Season 4 does have some of the better episodes, but it also has some of the worst (Fogg Bound, The Puppeteer, and The Tender Gun, to name a few). Ultimately, though, I feel I must agree with the other 1-star reviewers -- the series is 5-star, but greedy CBS and Paramount are beneath contempt for splitting the season in two and raising the price. I bought this on pre-order without noticing the ""Volume 1"" caption (and I'm pretty sure that it didn't appear in the description at that time). Still, I'll keep the DVD and buy Volume 2, but that's all at these high prices."
1,No thank you,"Dear Amazon, Please notify me when Season 4 Volumes 1&2 is available as a set for $32.99 and I might buy them, unless I find a bootleg copy from China cheaper sooner.Corporate greed strikes again. I got burnt on Wanted Dead or Alive buying the individual seasons, and within thirty(30) days of getting the last season lo and behold, all three seasons were available as a complete package for the same price as one season."
1,Greed Triumphs over Need,"We need Season 4 of HGWT but the greed gives us a half season at old full season prices. The corporate beancounters, America's version of terrorism, strike again. Contrast this March release, a pathetic joke, to the Complete Series release of Wanted: Dead or Alive ... 94 episodes for about the same price as 1/2 year of HGWT. Greed, greed, greed ... I believe I will pass on Season 3.5"
2,Won't buy a half-season rip--off,"Got desperate for a good western, and thought of buying the next season of Have Gun (I have the first three). But I absolutely refuse to buy one of these split seasons. As a previous reviewer wrote, this old series entails little extra cost for the distributor, so charging over 40 bucks for the entire season is just unacceptable. If the season is ever sold at a reasonable price, I'll buy. But not until then."
3,Not the best of Palitin,"I bought this disk to get Ken Curtis, best known as Festus on Gunsmoke, singing. Not many people know he was a crooner in the big band era before he went into acting."
4,Outback 10x21 binoculars,"Wanted something small in size to fit in a pocket and go backpacking, etc.These fit the bill just great and were a best buy in Consumers Reports."
4,Not bad for the size and price,"Overall I am happy with these binoculars for the price and I am glad I paid a little extra to get the 10x over the 8x. They are a good set of binoculars if you want something small, compact and light. If you don't mind something a little heavier and bulkier (and paying a little more) I would get something even more powerful in hindsight. So far I have used them for bird watching out the back window and also at an airshow. They were great for the airshow because they were easy to carry on my belt without being a nuisance. I definitely enjoyed my time at the airshow and better knew what was happening on the ground because of them."
1,"Worthless, despite the high CR rating","I bought this as a gift because it had been rated highly by Consumer Reports. I was terribly disappointed. They look, feel, and perform like a child's toy. The eyepieces are tiny, so it's hard to even get them to line up with your eyes; the field of view is miniscule, the image is muddy and incredibly dim. We returned them and purchased a pair of Nikan Action 8x40 for a similar price, and were delighted.If you are considering these because of price, look at the Nikon Action 8x40 -- crisp and bright, and similarly priced. If you must have something pocket-sized, consider the Nikon Travelite V series. The image is nowhere near the Nikon Action 8x40 mentioned above, but it's still superior to this one. Also the eyepieces are much wider. Nevertheless for birding etc, I would hesitate to reccomend any of the pocket binoculars. You're much betetr off with a full-size, esp. a (relatively) light and cheap one such as the Nikon Action 8x40."
3,Great CD but Not the same as the original,"Buddy Rich is one of my favorite drummers. I was under the impression that these are the original songs remastered but they are remakes. The versions of these songs is not up to Buddy Rich's standards, namely in the solos. It's a great cd, but if you can get the original, do so."
2,Not good,Album isn't that good as the past ones. Songs like Stingy and hell yeah are the only highlights. The other songs just ain't great just boring. Better luck next time.
3,Shirts represent his transformation,They represent his transformation from Freshmen to Senior. That's my take. his album is ok..I do miss tim's beats but it's good to change up sometimes. Look at Aaliyah. I think Tim only produced one track her her last album.
2,No!,"R&B/Hip-Hop can be pulled off, but under the current trend it is a no, no. The beats are far too generic, the lyrics bland, and the rap verses are nowhere near prolific. These are the problems that plague Ginuwine's 4th effort ""The Senior"". His vocals are not enough to save this mistake."
1,Ummmmm..no,"People wonder why R&B is dying & this cd proves it. The beats aren't favorable (or memorable) to the ears. A good R&B song is one you recognize from the opening beat & none of these songs left any recognition (although ""Bedda to Have Loved"" came close). I'm glad I borrowed instead of bought. The only good part of the cd is the interlude: ""On My Way"" and ""Bedda Man"".) The rest of the cd sounds like an unhappy baby."
2,Was dissapointed =(,"i am fan of Ginuwine,have all his albums..but this one i didn't like..except for two or three songs..i just think it's the whole rnb thug image...and the up-beat songs didn't do it for me,some of the slow songs i didn't like..I think he's best album is and still is THE BACHELOR..i would recommend a listener to listen to clips before you buy it or save your money."
5,Ginuwine does it again with '' The Senior'',"Ginuwine a.k.a Da Gizzle has made a great album and I love his messages for each song because his is only trying to bring all the best of him in this album. This is a different side of Ginuwine but, I definely enjoy it. Keep make hits I can't wait for the next album. If u are a big ginuwine fan (Get the album) It's Ginuwine doing what he does best and that's good music. Peace!!! G"
4,Totally Genuine,"I've always been a Ginuwine fan, but always been disappointed by his cd's. This is the first one that I really love. With the exception of the Mike Tyson interlude and the Sex song, this is an excellent album."
4,HOT CD,"I've always thought that genuwine was a great singer and that he didn't get enough props from people and enough recognition for his awesome hits. This album showed that he didn't need timberland's help to make a hot cd cuz he did it all on his own. My favorite songs were: hell yeah, chedda brings, in those jeans, sex, and stingy. He sounded great and i think this cd was definately worth buying...so go get it!"
4,its no 100 percent,this cd was good...but not a sgood as 100 percent. The senior has songs that have a lot more meaning to them than 100 percent but 100 percent had more hits on their. it is still a good cd to buy.
4,He's still doing his thing...,"I admit that this album isn't as good as the others before this one, but you have to give this album some credit. Yeah he doesn't have Timbaland but he's done a good job on his own. There are plenty of beautiful songs on this cd like, ""Chedda Brings"", ""In Those Jeans"", ""Locked Down"", ""Stingy"", ""Love You More"", etc. I must also admit that no album has topped ""The Bachelor"", but he's doing his best. I'll always be a Ginuwine supporter because his albums always have at least four songs I like unlike some albums but I'm not gonna say who.*sneeze*-Monica's new album. Oops it slipped."
1,Sugar In his tank,"I'm trying to be fare with this dude, but he his to sweet for me. Why is he looking like that on his c.d. cover. It looks like he has about 12 shirts on. When ginuwine first came out he wasn't so sweet acting, but now he has jumped out of the closet. He is singing about stuff that makes no sense. Hell Ya(what)have you ever seen a girl in the club--Hold on. I'm going to sing the real song that he wrote-Have you ever poured wine down a dudes shirt and licked it off and screamed HELLLL-YAAAAA. And I'm not even going to get started on the dancing thing. Ginuwine is like 35 and still dancing in his video's like that's hot. He needs to step on a land mine. GINUWINE---BOOOOO"
1,another typical Album from Him,"""Hell Yeah"" is a catchy Club track but like alot of Ginuwine's track record,it's standard soft easy going material.His vocals are what hurt Him more than anything because He just can't bring them up at all.Vocally He is a Whisper Below Usher&that's not saying a whole heck of alot.some catchy moments here&there but nothing special at all."
5,GINUWINE RIPPED IT AGAIN,"Ginuwine is one of the best RnB singers right now and as this being is 4th album he ripped it. I think that 100% was his best but this album is worth gettin to. My favorite songs on the album is, Bedda to have Loved, Lockdown, and Hell yeah. What i Love about him as an artist is he has the best interludes. He has one real good one after, Bedda to have loved. But to every good thing theres a bad thing which is the fact it took you always have a 2 or 3 year gap between his albums, and as a fan thats not good. But its iight KEEP THE SLOW JAMS COMMIN BROTHA"
3,It was cool but G's capable of better,"With his fourth release Ginuwine was personally quoted as syaing that this was his growth CD. Personally I feel an artist can grow but the main problem with this CD is that Ginuwine really can't handle fast tracks, unless he's being laced with some beats courtsey of Timberland. The only fast track really worth any merit on the CD are Hell Yeah and it's remix. Ginuwine is best suited with slow jams on this CD such as the second & thrid single from the CD In Those Jeans and Love You More respectively. My personal favorties on the CD include On My Way, Stingy and Our First Born. Ginuwine may have had a weak release in this CD after three constient hot ones but he's a good enoungh singer and performer to reedeem himself with the next one."
3,In those Jeans,"This was a better improvement over He's previous 2 albums. I recommend the tracks Stingy ,On My Way and Love You More .Get the cd used"
1,Ginuwine - THE DROPOUT,"What is this? I can't get jiggy with this crap? This album fails in so many ways. First off Ginuwine is not good at all by himself as far as producing and writing. He really needs some help. His song lyrics are childish and this whole thing about trying to be some kind of R&B thug is played out and very cheesy. This album has some tolerable songs but none of this is really inspiring or highlights his talent in any positive way. And the biggest disappointment.....Where in the world is Timberland on this? This album only has one good song...Our First Born, that's it. Don't waste your time with this."
4,A Classic!,"This is a Classic for any collection! A smooth mix with a Romantic edge. the sound is amazing, rapid delivery. Quality was ok, a few scratches on CD but unaffected play."
5,The Best Album From Ginuwine,"I think that this is the best album that Ginuwine had because of the Hip Hop elements in him. Tracks like ""Hell Yeah"" and ""Big Plans"" shows my point. Also slow jamz like ""In Those Jeans"" and ""Love You More"" makes this album the best"
3,fluegesi-nonginuwine,"in an attempt to keep up with his peers ginuwine forgot what took him to the top.although this album is decent,it lacks that one hit that makes you say yeah!without the featured guest on this album this release by ginuwine would be even worse.I rated this album a three out of five just for ginuwine givin the effort.maybe his next release will be ginuwine."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO GINUWINE?,Not good. Only 3 good songs. And these 3 good songs aint even all that. The rest of the Ginuwine's songs on this album sound like any regular R&B song out there. Nuthin different. Ginuwine needs to go back working with Timbaland. Cuz I aint never gon buy another album of his.
4,Good.Not as good as The Life though.But good.,I was in high expaectations for this album.And I got mostly what I wanted.Most of the tracks are good.I would buy this CD if I were you.1)Mike Tyson-intro.dont get it. 0/52)Get Ready-kinda like another intro.dont get snoops part in the song. 2.5/53)Chedda Brings-who is Jose Centquentez? 4/54)Hell Yeah-1st single.flashy. 5/55)In Those Jeans-3rd single.5/56)Stingy-a song from the Barbershop sountrack. 4/57)Love You More- 3/58)Bedda To Have Loved- 3/59)Locked Down- 4/510)On My Way- 4/511)Sex-i heard this song on the radio a good deal of times. 4/512)Bedda Man- 3/513)Our First Born- pretty serious song. 4/514)Big Plans-method man helps out alot. 5/515)Hell Yeah Remix-2nd single.5/516)Tigger & The Gizzle-outro with big tigger.talking bout how Ginuwine changed his style.tigger freestyles on it.completly gay. 0/5Buy this.
1,only 3 good tracks on this cd,"my friend told me that this cd is great and worth money. I bought it and I was very defeated. this album is boring and ginuwine is boring! only three tracks are worth attention - get ready, hell yeah remix and bedda man."
2,Could have been better,"I got to admit, when I first bought this cd I thought the tracks would grow on me. Well after 4 months of owning it there are only a few tracks worth listening to. As one of the reviewers noted here, most of the cd is boring. In those Jeans & On My Way are really the only tracks worth playing but you will quickly tire of them. IMO, its best to admire his last three classmanships and leave the senoir alone until he graduates."
2,"Change, Think About It!","Sometimes change works and then again NOT! Yeah we know he's tring to mix it up a little being his senior album and all. But, what got him were he is in his career? Obviously he's doesn't remember. This was a dissapointing album for me coming off the previous one."
2,Average CD,"Ginuwine hasn't made the CD I know he's capable of making. This is lightweight stuff. He's in need of better material and proper management. G; I suggest you work with Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Joe & Joshua P. Thompson, Kevin ""Skes'pere"" Briggs, The Neptunes, The Underdogs: Damon Thomas & Harvey Mason, Jr., Daryl Simmons and go back to Timbaland & Missy for one of their funky futuristic tunes."
4,Elroy Sparta Trail Guidebook,"If you plan on riding the Elroy Sparta trail in Wisconsin this is a must have book. Take your time and read it before venturing to the trail. The author has ridden this trail numerous times and lists all the best places to eat, sleep and visit. He mentions places that are ""must sees"" you will probably miss if you don't read this book. The author also did a lot of research on the construction and history of the railroad and tunnels that ran where this trail resides. This info is included in the book. Grab yourself a copy and highlight all of the places that you would like to visit then go out and hit the trail."
4,"Great book, but...","Where are the definitions? This book goes into every nuance about making a bow, as described by absolutely fanatical bowyers. A little bit of humor and a few personal stories are related, making it a more entertaining read. Every chapter is quite thorough and caters to the novice except the longest (at around 75 pages) and most important chapter, ""Bow Design & Performance,"" which for some reason assumes that you know what tillering, set, draw weight, draw length, string height, string stretch, etc., mean. Some of these terms are somewhat self-explanatory and some are given specific attention, but again, the basics are ignored. I had to skip the chapter and read further for tidbits of clarification and then had to go to some other sources to become familiar with just what these terms mean. What is a ""bible"" on a subject without the basics described thoroughly?"
3,Theres better around,"This book was not what i was expecting, it gives you ideas and some reference on designs. Does not do much in the basis of giving you instructions, more like this is what should happen when you do this and this. There's an entire small section devoted to charts and graphs spread out through the entire book, and unless you have the facilities to out these bits of data to the test they're completly useless. If you want to build a bow, get a better book or look up online how to do it, because this book wont really get you anywhere"
5,My son studies this like the bible it claims to be!,"A great book, loaded with information. My 12 year old son is now making his first bow out of red oak, and he's been studying this book non-stop. He quotes the authors by name and practically has this memorized. He wants to move to Oregon to get the kinds of wood mentioned in the book, but we've found a way to make a bow out of oak for now, instead...He's looking forward to reading the other volumes."
4,Beautiful,"Wow, a fine work showing examples of the evolution of the bow in different cultures. Great photos and information included in an artful style.!"
4,Excellent book and excellent series. The authors give very good descriptions and instruction.,The authors give very good descriptions and instruction on the process of making bows as well as great information on the processes of design and testing of bows.There is some great historical information as well as lots of practical skills and information that will help you to make your own bow from cutting down a tree to seeing the arrow fly.
5,great addition to any star wars collection,i obtained this cd set from my dad and now it is one of my favorite cds in my collection. i just love all of the cool songs and it is just a great cd it made me get the empire strikes back and return of the jedi cds and they are all the greatest cds of all time! thanks john williams and george lucas!
5,Simply spellbinding,"The STAR WARS soundtrack is one of the finest achievements of John Williams. Throughout this soundtrack, one can feel the emotions he puts into his writing. The Binary Sunset music is so evocative, and so is the hair-raising Battle of Yavin. Of course, there is more than the ubiquitous Main Title, and the TIE Fighter Attack is considered as real excitement and drama. The soundtrack is made more appealing with its new presentation, complete with excellent essays by Michael Mattesino and vivid recorded sound. I would truly recommend this to the Star Wars collector."
5,All the original SW trilogy music you could ever ask for,"Simply brilliant. Music from the original trilogy. One disk for every movie plus a fourth with special, previously unreleased material. The music isn't all taken straight from the movies. The Imperial March on the second disc is a live orchestra arrangement (meaning it sounds more like a traditional song or piece in format). You get this very nice box that looks good in any bookshelf and there is a very informative booklet accompanying the box. Lots of great pictures from the movies and conceptual artwork contained within.BTW John Williams is the biggest genius to ever have graced the movie music industry.Some other movies that he has written music for:SupermanJawsIndiana Jones trilogy"
5,Worth the money,"Definitely buy the more expensive, non-slimline version of this soundtrack. The extras are well worthwhile.First, the liner notes are superb! I knew that the empire and rebellion each had their own music, but I never realized that each character had a theme! Reading the liner notes while listening to the soundtrack, I was amazed at how complex this work is, and have a new found admiration of John Williams.Second, the extra tracks are great! At the end of the first disc, all takes of the main theme are presented together, complete with incidental noise, voices, and all.I'd definitely spring for the more expensive version of the soundtrack - it's so much more meaningful now."
3,A mixed bag from an audiophile perspective...,"Audiophiles, take note -- portions of this anthology sound like they were hastily transferred to digital from a second or third generation copy of the master tapes. There is audible tape dropout in certain parts, as well as some hiss. Now hiss, in and of itself is not a big deal -- I actually prefer that it be left in, for the most part. But the dropouts are unforgivable. I've also heard an occasional crackling distortion, either from the original tapes or digital clipping. This recording was made in 1977, not 1957... why should there be these problems? This stuff is all too audible through a pair of Beyerdynamic DT-880 headphones.Anyway, I haven't heard other remastered editions, but I recommend avoiding this one for the most part. Certain songs sound excellent, but many are marred by master tape issues to the point where they become difficult to listen to through good headphones, breaking the mood of the piece."
5,What a great deal for some of John William's best!,"I have the records hiddens away, and I was overjoyed to see this set on CD. The same great music that all Star Wars fans fell in love with plus more for such a great price! If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll want to get this!"
5,Another SF hit - or miss?,"I grew up on SF but only now, late in the day, do the writers seem to be tackling the racial issue. While not all the projections that I read of back in the 50s and 60s worked out I wish more SF writers would tackle the race issue. Hold Back This Day was a real page tuner and is worth the read regardless of one's views on the race issue. Even Huxley in his Brave New World didn't foresee this issue but Kendall has met it head on. And just in the nick of time before the so called hate laws shut down this genre of SF writing.I only hope Kendall writes more on the subject and that other authors follow suit. Who in the 50s would have thought that gambling casinos and mass runs by the general population to let off steam,as foreseen by the SF writers back then would be so popular today? One can only speculate how the NWO and it's mandated racial blending will work out. Society needs more Kendalls to investigate this important issue."
4,A book that does what it sets out to do.,"A good, short work of poems by a writer who is able to say many things with very little words. It is not a complex work of poems by any means, and I believe it was the writer's intent to keep it short and sweet. Still, I found myself agreeing to many of the things Reyes writes about: from the simple joys of a summer breeze to the existential angst of asking who we are. Not a bad read."
1,Dissapointing content,"The main idea of this short book could be a good one, still, the writer lacks the ability to keep the reader's interest.Personally, I had higher expectations of this book, but to give it a little bit of ""props"", all I can say is that if you are looking for a ""cruise-control"" type of reading experience, this is the book to buy."
5,PK'S REVIEW OF EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE ONE,"VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ALBUM.ORIGIONALLY BOUGHT DO YOU LOVE ME BY PATTI AUSTIN WHICH WAS RELEASED ON SINGLE IN THE UK IN 1981.A FANTASTIC TRACK.ADDED TO THE CLASSIC COME TO ME,THE LOVELY COVER OF STOP,LOOK,LISTEN AND THE FUNKY SCARE ME TO DEATH,THIS MAKES FOR A REAL MUST FOR PATTI AUSTIN FANS."
3,Something's missing,"As ""remastered"" editions go, the general sound quality of this reissue is absoloutely fantastic, but unfortunately, Friday Music was wrong to call this edition ""original LP remastered"". The LP, released in 1980 on Qwest Records, contained a full-length version of the hit ""Baby Come To Me"" including three measures in the intro, adding about 7 seconds. No CD issues anywhere included the full length version of the song, and so sadly the status quo remains. Very disappointing."
2,not stable,"Good idea, we have an uppercut bag in our Muay Thai gym but the uppercut bag is part of the heavy bag. I bought this item to practice my uppercuts at home, but it slides off, and it's too soft. no matter how much I tighten the strap. Unless you hit like a litte boy or girl, this bag suxx."
4,Christina Aguilera,"This track is the one that Christina needed to produce for me to sit up and take notice of her, and she was completely successful.For anyone who has ever felt a victim, and this is not at all foreign to Christina, this song encourages you to stand up and become victorious.Amongst so much fictitious music and so many fictitious musicians, Christina has remained true to herself despite the fact that reality can be hard on the eyes.A great song and a great message.Keep it real"
3,Well made but small,Purchased this along with a two-compartment insert to replace the 4 compartment insert that comes with the Domke F6 bag. The combined size of this and the two compartment insert is almost an inch less than the 4 compartment insert. Wanted to put a small leica RF film camera in this insert and two DSLR lenses in the 2 compartment unit. There is plenty of room in the bag. Ended up cutting one panel out of the 4 compartment insert and everything fits just fine. Sent this back.
2,Still not ideal but OK,"This is fine, for what it is, but it is still not a padded cell to fill the entire space of my F-6 bag. To be truly protected, the padding should fit correctly and cover the entire inside of the bag, not just 70% of it. I like the fact that it is movable and I will use it, but the F-6 bag is too small for a full-sized DSLR (Nikon D90 with small zoom lens) and lots of other equipment and so one large FULLY padded compartment would be ideal. I ""sort of"" solved the problem with a zing sling."
5,Excellent horse,"This Breyer horse is one of my favorites! He displays elegance, power, and beauty all at once. He is well proportioned so he hardly ever falls over. He's very durable so the few times he has fallen over he was okay. One thing that isn't perfect about him is his round tummy. The riders don't fit very well on him for that reason. Their legs stick out too much.I would overall rate this horse 5 stars. He's just about perfect and you won't regret buying him!"
4,this phrase book is alright,"the phrase book is clearly labeled and i really appreciated how easy it is to locate certain topics. it is also great that they have the phrases written in thai so that you can point to words when you cannot pronounce them to someone. however the audio tape goes very fast and it is hard to learn some of the longer phrases just by listening to the tape. but if you are serious about pronouncing things right, do NOT buy a phrase book without a tape. thai is a hard language to pronounce and you need to hear it spoken to learn it."
2,Lots of sodium,"Be forewarned, this product is high in sodium. Be sure to look at the nutritional information. Also, when preparing this product you may want to cut some of the water. Following the on box directions may result in watery red beans and rice."
1,I dislike this rice/bean blend,"I've been a vegan for six years, so I know a thing or two about rice and beans, and definitely have some strong preferences. I don't like Zatarain's rice and beans (red or black). There are a few different reasons for this, but the primary one is that on two separate occasions I've found ""stuff"" in the mix. Both times it was the same thing: a sort of fibrous, bone-like object, about the size of a marble. The first time it happened I was rather grossed out, but the second time I quit this stuff for good. I've found that both Wegmanns and Giant offer store brands of rice that taste better and are often more cost efficient, and I have not eaten Zatarain's since that."
1,Wagon Train: The Complete Third Season in Embossed Tin,"I was looking forward to receiving this season after watching the first two seasons and thoroughly enjoying them but how very, very disappointing to receive the Embossed Tin with a dent in it due to it having no protection whatsoever around the tin. After paying so much for this item I expected better."
2,Well guess what? No Change In Packaging! I can't believe it!,"I'm really disappointed again in the packaging on this.Packaged just like S1 & S2,so buy more dvd holders to hold those discs.You can bet that they won't change the packaging on the other seasons either.DAMN!I'm done buying,especially Tin from this studio until they get their act together if and when that ever happens."
5,"Loved, loved, loved this!","Jan Karon just takes you right into the world of Mitford. Lovely, thoroughly enjoyable. More, more, more!"
3,Mitford Moments review,I've enjoyed the Medford series. This is a book to be picked up on occasion. It is a nice reintroduction to the characters and a little insight into the author.I also enjoyed the recipes.
4,A Smorgasbord of Goodies,"Jan Karon entertains and inspires in her usual fashion. Personal reflections, plays, and trivia add to the cuttings from her books. However, if you want more than appetizers, you will have to buy her novels. Which is not a novel idea!"
5,Mitfor Bedside Companion,"A friend told me about this book and it is great, I have not had time to look through the whole book, I would buy it as a gift for a friend."
2,SLOW READ,"I HAVE LIKED ALL OF JAN KARON'S BOOKS IN THE PAST, BUT THIS WAS A SLOW READ, I WAS UNABLE TO IMMERSE MYSELF IN IT. READ THE FIRST 75 PAGES AND NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK. SEEMS LIKE SHE IS WRITING BASED ON HER PAST SUCCESSES, BUT WITH NO DEPTH OR NEW IDEAS."
4,"Eden - the ""adult"" soap","Set among the backdrop of paradise, Eden was one of the first ""cross-over"" series from pay cable to basic cable. Purchased from the Playboy Channel it aired, very censored, on the USA Network late(r) at night. The DVD is uncensored and a fun look back on the early 90s and what the Playboy Channel felt was racey.Hot guys and hot girls make this DVD set a great addition to ""eye-candy"" videos."
4,Not Too Bad.,"This is a low budget film with low budget, mostly unknown actors. Still, they do an acceptable job dealing with a sorta-bad script. The effects are what you would expect for a film like this, but still it's fun to watch. I don't expect much when I buy films like this as most all of them are low budget affairs. So ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. Just be aware and enjoy what you get!"
3,Typical Made for TV Disaster Movie,"I won't spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it so this review will be short. Having seen this movie on the Sci Fi Channel, I can say it is about average for a made for TV disaster movie. It starts off good with an interesting premise and quickly goes downhill as the plot become cheesier and cheesier.The only bright spots in the entire movie are the characters played by Xander Berkeley and Reiko Aylesworth who most people probably know from the Fox show ""24."" Despite the mediocre script and ridiculous plotline, both manage to shine in their roles. If you're a fan of either Xander or Reiko, the movie is worth purchasing."
4,Loved it!,I really loved this movie-it's one of my favorites. The characters were real and interacted well together and I thought the plot was suspenseful! I would definitely recommend this movie!
5,The Great Armand Assante,"This movie has everything action, mystery and the sexy Armand Assante. Based on a true story."
3,"Okay, Not Great","First, I love Japanese food and probably have around ten Japanese cookbooks. There are two major problems with this particular cookbook. First, the pages started falling out the first time I used it. The publisher did not do a good job with the binding. Second, the recipes just aren't very good and use a lot of ingredients that are hard to find even if you live near a Japanese grocery store, which I do. Ingredients such as nuka (rice bran), udo (a kind of vegetable), taro root, konnyaku (devil's tongue jelly), gobo (burdock root), and mitsuba leaves are often difficult to find. As for the recipes themselves, they just aren't very tasty. I do love her thick omelet recipe, but you can find similar recipes in other cookbooks. The photos and directions are the one strength this book has: they are clear and well-done.For a better cookbook check out Naomi Kijima's Bento Boxes. Most of Naomi's recipes are for single servings, but can easily be doubled or tripled or whatever."
4,Fun book to learn,Just moved to Japan love the book. Teaches us how to make our favorite dishes at a lower cost.
1,bring back postum!!,"I had high hopes for a replacement for postum which was taken off the market in the US. Unfortunately, this one isn't it. It had an acidic taste and left a scratchy feeling in the back of my throat and just plain didn't taste good."
1,Not for me,"Unfortunately, I didn't like the taste. The carob was too strong, and I was expecting more of a sweeter Mocha flavor. That was not the case. This is not a product to experiment with because it involves the purchase of 6 cans. I also felt it left an aftertaste. Overall, I was disappointed. The price is great for 6 cans - but you have to like the product!"
1,fine.. if you can get past the aftertaste and burning in your throat,I've had other teeccino flavors that are excellent but... the maya mocha is absolutely horrible. It contains chili flakes which leaves the most peculiar taste in your mouth and actually burns my throat. I thought it was just me because I've been drinking teeccino for a while but hubby tried it also and had the same reaction. He's on his way to Atlanta Bread right now to get us some coffee. I'm so sorry I wasted the money buying this case. I'm not sure I can get used to it.
5,A Refreshing Change,"Coffee, both caffenated and decaf, were upsetting my stomach, so I was very happy to read a review of the Teecino coffees and happier still when I first tried Teecino coffee last year. This favor, Organic Maya Mocha, is delicious. I recommend it to anyone wishing to eliminate entirely or just reduce their coffee intake. Anyone interested in learning more about this coffee line should go to www.Teecino.com"
2,Not Crazy About Flavor,"I am a huge fan of Teeccino Herbal Coffees, but I was not crazy about this one. It also left a slight after taste. I mix it with another flavor to make it taste better."
5,No more testing quarts of paint!,"I must have tested 15 different colors for my family room and still wasn't happy with any of them. My husband couldn't believe how much money I'd wasted on buying quarts of paint, not to mention that he thought I was loosing my mind. I was beginning to wonder myself. Then I bought this book. I loved the recipe called ""Apalachian Spring"" and decided to use the yellow for my family room, the green for the den and the violet as an accent color. It worked! Finally, no more testing quarts. I noticed that the colors in the book are the old Benjamin Moore colors, but the paint store was still able to mix them. They said that they can always be mixed at any paint store. This book was the answer for me. I highly recommend it."
4,a good reference (not just for rooms),"The Perfect Palette is written in a romantic way, which seems customary in decorating books. It conjures up very imaginative ideas behind certain combinations of color, comparing the color schemes to daydreams of Paris in Winter, Swan Boats, and Russian Ballet. Each page has a description and a photograph or illustration using the chosen color scheme.Though it is written romantically, it also has quite a bit of practical information on how to paint, with useful tips on the process. It is an easy to follow guide to (nearly) foolproof paint schemes, which translate well not only in your home, but also for artists looking for color combinations to use in painting and illustration."
3,perfect palette,would benefit from more photographs of actual rooms. The color sketches make it difficult to envision the finished room
5,The best!,"This book is just awesome. I used several of the colors in the book and they looked wonderful on my walls. This is one of the few paint books that I have bought that actually provide the brand and color names. It is extremely frustrating to pick up decorating books or magazines, find a color that's appealing and then find no reference to the brand or color name. This book actually provides three different paint brands to pick from for each color. I also really liked her descriptions of different color combinations and the feelings (restful, cozy, bright) that goes along with the different colors. The price is reasonable so even if you don't use the colors in the book, its a great place to get ideas. I highly recommend this book. I hope she releases another!"
1,not useful,"Although the subtitle is ""fifty inspired color plans for painting every room in your home"", there are only 16 photos. The rest of the palettes have very simple inked and colored illustrations, for example, a cameo, a couple of flamingos, two pears, a bicyclist and other uninspiring subjects. This book is arranged by color combinations. Sounds good, but it isn't. For example, the ""Iceland Poppy"" palette has a poorly executed water color painting of light pink poppies surrounded by lime green against a white fence. It also shows three color swatches but the colors don't match the colors in the painting! This is how most of the palettes are illustrated."
1,Where are the example rooms?,"This book contains 50 color palettes - each one with three paint samples (poorly reproduced) and a sample of the colors used together. Ocasionally, the sample is a photograph of a room (usually with colors far from the suggested palette). More often, the sample is an abstract painting of, say, a cyclist wearing a purple jersey with a green background. Not exactly practical..."
4,I found the book to be very helpful,"I love this book. The one drawback that I have found is that Benjamin Moore has changed the numbers to the paint chips. I was able to find some of the old numbers and have my paint mixed, but when those recipes are gone from my local hardware store I will have to guess what color chips have replaced the old ones. I would like to see a new updated book. Without this book I would have struggled picking out paint colors and would not have put the right accent colors in the rooms.I am very happy with my choices."
2,"Great concept, but low quality color printing is a problem.","I really like the concept behind this book, but the low quality printing (at least for the paperback edition) makes it very hard to use. I work in the marketing communications field and I know it's difficult to reproduce colors exactly, but many of the paint chip colors shown in this book bear no resemblance to the actual paint chips you can find at your Benjamin Moore paint store. To use this book I had to stand in front of the paint chip display at the paint store and figure out what the ""real"" colors were supposed to be for each of the palettes."
2,Why pick paint first?,"I just attended a class on how to get a total decorating scheme from the selection of a single fabric, given by Jennifer Raffo, author of ""Fabrique Technique."" Her theory is the most logical that I've heard so far, as well as the easiest way to totally coordinate a room. The manufacturers of fabrics give you your color scheme in your ""anchor"" fabric, including wall and floor colors, so why get frustrated by picking out wall colors first, then trying to find a fabric to go with it? If the paint and fabric manufacturers would work together, we as consumers would have an easier time of decorating. Not everyone can afford an interior designer. The painting information contained was useful, but nothing that can't be found anywhere else."
1,The # 1 most worthless book you could ever buy!,"The reveiws on this book had been so great. I bought this book THE PERFECT PALETTE to help me decide what color I should paint my house. This book did not help me nor did it help my sister (an art major in college) in any way, shape or form! We both felt buying this book was a total waste of our time and my money. If you really want to know information about colors, and the ""do and don't"" rules of picking the right color. Then your first ""DON'T"" you should be DON'T buy this worthless book! A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,It's all PASTELS!,"A nice book IF you like PASTEL colors. Not enough variety to be useful to me. I found ""Colors For Your Every Mood"" by Leatrice Eiseman to be a more helpful resource."
3,A Helpful Book for Real People,"This is the most instructive of the color guide books I have purchased, providing tips on coordinating and accent colors, and even suggestions on what wood finishes complement the color schemes. The emphasis is on what PAINT can do for your home, even if your home isn't straight out of Architectural Digest. I do agree with other reviewers that a major shortcoming is using sketches to ""illustrate"" the palettes. Photographs would be much more helpful."
2,Disappointing,The color chips in this book are all pastel on the pages. Very hard to actually apply the information to select paint chips. I wouldn't recommend it. Try Annie Sloan's Color Schemes for Every room instead. You'll be much happier.
4,Great Ideas for the Creatively Confused!!,"We just painted our bedroom this weekend and used this book to choose our color. We picked Benjamin Moore Orange 131 (warm and pumpkin-like) and it looks AMAZING! It's a color I never would have chosen, but thanks to this book we took a chance and it looks great. The only reason I'm giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the illustrations are kind of lame - I wish the author had used more photographs of real rooms."
2,"Colorful, but not practical","I'm a real novice when it comes to interior decorating--so when I got this book I was looking for someone to just tell me what works. Krims does attempt to do just that by selecting specific color palettes, but she doesn't provide enough actual real world examples to make the book useful to a novice like me. I need to see how the colors work together in real life, not just in a watercolor painting. I ended up sending the book back. The only reason I gave it a two instead of a one is that I got the sense that colors she selected really would work together--afterall they looked pretty good in the paintings."
5,Rising High.,"Being an avid listener of trance music, and an owner of over 700 cds as well as 1000 mp3s, I personally feel that Holding On (Armin Van Buuren's Rising High Mix), is the best uplifting trance song ever. Not a single soul that I have played it for has ever told me otherwise. Add it to your collection. Armin's mix is one of the greatest remixes by any artist, ever. And in my book, my number one favorite trance song. SO GET IT! :)"
1,Recall,"I have not been able to see this move and therefore unlike others I will not rate this DVD without seeing it first. But the problems expressed by the other revues as well as some presumptuous critics (whom I personally never listen to I prefer to make my own choices based on what I like) such as horrible video quality, bad duding and subtitling are being addressed in a resent recall which will fix the above problems and if you already have a copy of Spring and Chaos and know what I'm referring to then you can go to tokyopop.com to get details on how to get a new disk to replace the one you already have. However it will take until some time in mid July for them to ship and they're also holding back all shipments of this move until the new discs are ready"
2,Great movie gets abused,"I'm like 14 minutes into this visual masterpiece when the video pixelizes! I'm Very disappointed because this movie seems awsome and has (or is supposed to have) incredible visuals! I would have shied away from this if I had known of the horrible treatment this was given by Tokyopop. Be warned! Only get this if you are a huge fan and can put up with it. I'm keeping mine, but I am quite upset."
3,Incoherent,"I agree with the other reviewers about the rich imagination and well written script - something rarely seen in anime. What bothered me with this movie was the excessive use of computer graphics. The CG were completely out of place and unnatural, which almost completely ruined this movie for me. The hand-drawn parts are fine, though. This movie is supposed to be an animated movie, and it doesn't deliver the animation part in a believable way - hence the three stars. You have been warned."
1,Catch a Falling Star,I didn't care for this book at all. I bought it to help me understand family member with dementia. It really didn't help. There were others that were better in my opinion.
5,Grappelli Does It Again!,"This is a rock solid performance where Grappelli and Grisman elevate themselves to near God status. I don't know if I have ever heard anyone any one blend so smoothly with Grappelli. This is my all time favorite version of Satin Doll, and Sweet Georgia Brown & Tiger Rag are exceptional too. All in all this is a must have cd if you are a fan of either of these to musical giants - you can't go wrong with this one!!!"
5,Encounter,"All the DAWG grandchildren seem like really happy to play with this fabulous Jazz Violin Player.During this concert, Grappelli must have found the image of Django on the performance of Grisman. Grappelli's elegant and sophisticated playing was a complete contrast to Grisman's totally extravagant and free pikin style. This is almost same as assortment of QHCP. I was rearlly impressed with their tender-hearted tones."
3,Grappelly in Top Form,Grappelly was timeless and delivers an excellent set of performances in this video. Nice job.
5,Great Old Music,"If you like to hear a classic old time swing music, you can't do any better than this Gem! It will bring life into your feet and get you up and Moving!!!!!"
5,A more Darker Musical journey,"The music is taking a darker path since the Rebellion are being persude by Imperial forces. But now to the music.This is my favariot of all the Star Wars series. It comes with 6 new themes however only three are very important. I will first start of the lesser 3 important themes. First there is Lando's (Cloud City) Theme which has a bussiness like overture. Then there is Boba Fett's (the bounty hunter) theme which is a erie'st of all. then there is the droids theme (C-3PO and R2D2)which is sofest and friendliest of all.Now to the more important one. First there is a love theme between Han and Leia. Then there is a very Gentle and very noble theme for the Jedi master Yoda; and there of course the most important of all, the Imperial March (Darth Vader's theme) which becomes the definitive theme for the Imperial.A Must have"
5,The Greatest movie score ever,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest, most detailed, most original score there ever was for a movie. This is such a wonderful blend of romantic, action, thrilling and beautiful themes ever put into one film. The soundtrack is worth $50.00 to me, but would pay more. If you truely love musical score and are in aw of Mr. Williams' music this would truely be a worthwhile investment. Pure excellence."
5,Best in the Trilogy,"This is the best score from the original three 'Star Wars' films. Williams wins again, triumphing with many new songs, the best (of course) being the ""Imperial March,"" with its thumping strings and ominous horns, rising to an maniacal exuberance. Buy this CD; you won't be able to stop listening!"
3,Still missing some music,"Mind you, I'm giving three stars for the set, not the track itself which is wonderful. But someone really messed up the placement and editing of these tracks. On disc two for example, the music that plays during the credits is completely gone, as is the rebel fleet scene, and the music track titles do not at all match with their scenes in the movie. They should've reviewed this CD set a little more closely before releasing it."
5,one of the best movie soundtracks,"I am a very big fan of John Williams' work and I watched just about every show he did on Evening at Pops on PBS.He is a master at creating the best movie soundtracks.I mentioned in an early review about me working on my own sci-fi space war epic,when it is picked up by one of the major film studios,I want John Williams at the top of my list to create the music."
5,As good as STAR WARS in every respect,"I'd hate to rank the STAR WARS film scores, but I think that this is an outstanding contribution to the music of the Trilogy. Of course, figuring prominently thorughout is the ""Imperial March"" - which I feel should have been introduced in the first film - dark and sinister, yet as instantly recognisable as the Phantom of the Opera's theme in the famous Broadway musical. Passion and drama show up as prominently as they did in the first film, and the score is captivating from first bar to last. Apart from the Imperial March, the Han/Leia love theme is wildly romantic and wistful. And so is Yoda's gentle theme, showing his harmony with the Force. This is truly an excellent continuation of the STAR WARS TRILOGY score."
5,Quality Part,I put this line in my 2000 DeVille and it was a perfect factory fit. Very well put together as it is made here in the US.
5,Camera case/Backpack,The Lowepro Orion Trekker Dual Compartment Photo Backpack I ordered arrived promptly. I found the product to be just as advertised and am very satisfied with the purchase. I also am satisfied with value I received for my money.
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,This is a great soundtrack!!! The seller was quick to respond and the product was delivered secure and in a timely manner. Thank you sooo much! It is a favorate of mine.
5,Dope...,Man! This CD is so dope. The music production is total different and the performance was off the hook. This is a diamond in the rough. Kurpt and Daz ripped it on this. Who ever Frank Nitti is he is hellva tight! Sherms lazy style is fresh. This lable should really promote this CD. I can sell 100K easy.
3,color shown online is not what is delivered,"the picture on the package is correct but the quilt is a darker cream and the rings have a dark blue in it instead of the lavender. i returned it once hoping that it was a mistake, but got the same one again. amazon was really good about making the switch out but there's a problem with what is advertised and what you get."
1,Disappointing,"This quilt is NOT all cotton. It is polyester fill. And it has an awful feel to it. Amazon never answered my emails about the all cotton thing, which was a lie."
2,Buyer beware!!!,"I purchased this supposedly king size quilt for my queen size bed to make sure it would be large enough to cover the extra thick mattress I have but it barely hangs over the sides. It is more like a double or twin size but the tag on it says 90"" x 100"" which is supposed to be king size.The colors and pattern are very pretty but the fabric does not lay flat. There are puckers in the fabric between the stitching. It is almost like someone had washed in hot water and then put it in a hot dryer and the outer trim shrunk causing the rest of the fabric in the middle of the quilt to pucker."
3,Great for the price you are paying,"The jacket fits well, I was hoping that the leather was softer but for the price your paying it comes with amor and all. I had although a problem with the liner that I am still waiting for resolution, it came with a tear in the arm pit they are supposed to replace the liner but still has not arrived and it is almost 3 weeks since I received it."
4,Great product for the price,"Jacket received within proper time line. Great leather, perfect fit, great price for a armor leather jacket. Stitching is not the best quality but I can live with that."
5,Love them!,"These dish cloths are amazing. They clean dishes and countertops thoroughly and dry easily without any funky smell getting in them. After years of using WS dishcloths, these make dishwashing fantastic!"
1,disappointed in product but customer service extraordinary,"I bought these because they had rave reviews and I was desperate to find a dishrag that didn't get mildewy after a couple of days. I ringed these out and laid flat to dry after use and they still started smelling within two days of use! Would return but already gave some as Christmas gifts. Sad. Money down the drain on this one.UPDATED: To follow up on this. Wizard Industries 100% stands behind their product and granted me a full refund within a day of me posting negative feedback. Additionally they asked that I send my rags back in for further testing as there must have been some malfunction with my particular lot of rags. Billy C from customer service was friendly, concerned and courteous. Based on customer service alone I would definitely purchase from this company again."
3,"Fine towels, not blue...","These seem like fine towels, but be advised, I received three towels, each a different color edging; red, yellow, and green. None were even slightly blue."
2,Not very durable,"When I first bought these, I loved the feel of them. If they'd stayed that way, I would have come back and bought more of them. Sadly, that wasn't the case. I've owned them for over a year now, and they've changed quite a bit. I've never put them in the dryer, but they still shrunk to almost half the size. They are now thick and unpleasant feeling. I did wash them in the washing machine, however.If you buy them, I'd recommend handwashing or the gentle cycle inside a net bag, using a mild detergent. I don't know if this would solve the problem, but it's worth a try. As for me, I won't ever buy these again."
3,Notice time,"Since there are some big changes on models later than 1990, this book won't be very useful if you want to use it on a car earlier than 90. also, it is not quite easy to understand if you don't have any background knowledge on cars."
1,A Complete Waste Of Money,This book is useless. I should have known from the title that there is no way to provide useful info for 323/Mx-3/626/Millenia/Protege all in one book. After buying the book I found I was right.
5,A great recording,"Only the first 5 songs are from 1964, The last 7 are from Montreux Jazz Festival in 1972 which causes the musician confusion. 3 songs are misnamed; Trouble No More (listed as Sweet Little Angel), Rollin' And Tumblin' (listed as All Night Long), and I Feel Like Going Home (listed as Early Morning Blues). It's great music from the beginning to the end."
1,This Gum is BAD,"This is a new formula and made in Mexico. If you liked the old formula please don't waste you money on this. Just another corporation saving money by moving jobs to Mexico, worst than that is the gum just tastes BAD."
2,Very Elementry,The book is not that great for mature reader. It can be effective for a young reader might be in High School or middle school. Very wordy and a lot of examples from sports. It is hard to relate to most of the examples. The material is also dated which might not apply to common work life of today.
1,crude and tasteless,"I did not realize that it was an R when I ordered it, and I don't watch those because I don't like profanity and promiscuity. This had plenty of both, and I couldn't watch more than about 10 min of it, and it landed in the garbage."
3,Typical Altman but with British Accents,"I wanted to watch this after reading that Julian Fellows of ""Downton Abbey"" had written it. I expected the period details and accuracy that the film delivers. But Altman's improvisational style of directing, with constantly overlapping dialogue, makes the British accents almost unintelligable except in two person scenes. The story is an interesting and satisfying one, but the characters are too difficult to understand, and the relationships too convoluted to figure out."
5,Editorial Wild Oats,"Written with Twain's unfailing humor and creativity, I enjoyed this book immensely, especially the obituary for Julius Ceasar. Give it a try!"
1,smokin aces,"one of the worst movies I've ever seen. senseless violence, horrid acting but the script was so bad one can't blame the actors totally especially since the plot and directing were inane and predictable. not even good if you're desperate."
2,Blu-Ray Review,I Wish I didn't buy the 2 pack from Best Buy because Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball is nothing like the first one. Blu-Ray quality is fine but the movie itself is terrible. Oh well. What a waste...lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS ASS!,"This movie sucks ass, nothing about it is done right. It is filled with piss poor camerawork, bad acting, zero good action scenes, fast motion that makes this movie look even worse than it already is, tons of bad writing, boring cookie-cutter characters with zero personality and zero funny moments. Nothing about this movie is interesting or good. This movie is very poorly executed. A drunken monkey can direct or make a better movie than this one.GOD THIS MOVIE SUCKS, I CAN'T BELIEVE I WATCHED IT. The first movie was okay and had some thrilling moments, but could've been better. As for this cinematic pile of crap ""Smokin' Aces,"" it doesn't have any thrilling moments. I highly regret watching this movie, its about as bad as anything that Uwe Boll has ever directed. Nothing about it is thrilling or exciting. Take my advice: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. i give this movie a -5/10. Believe me, it's that bad."
1,Extinguish Smokin' Aces 2,"Awful. A total waste of time. If you want clever big screen action, watch ""The Tournament"" with Kelly Hu instead."
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"Utterly mind-blowing how bad this ""movie"" is. Shamefully bad. Everyone involved with making it--especially the director, DP and writer(s)--should be band from ever working on another movie ever again. Too bad we can't send these criminally bad ""filmmakers"" to jail for making such an atrocity. These guys would get triple life sentences for the horror they've committed against movie fans. I felt assaulted, violated and ripped-off while watching it."
2,"OK movie, but special effects were horrible.","I could create better looking explosions on my own PC - who were the special effects people ? Hopefully they were fired, explosions were nothing more than layered over the actual screen shot. Horrible. Movie itself not bad - it's a no brain shoot em up."
1,Low-budget remake of the original movie,"I loved the origian Smoking Aces a lot, a 5-star movie as far as I am concerned. Tons of action, and a pretty good plot. Again, that's the first one. This one definitely failed to live up to the expectations. Low class actors. Lower class acting. Lower budget special effects. Plot that was just not believable at all. And worst of all, it tries to copy the original movie down to the smallest details. E.g. like Tremors family wearing avaiator goggles and dressing up all crazy, just like the natzi group did in the first one. At times its pathetic. And surgeon's unexpected passion for the poison chick is another poorly thought out and acted sequence.I'd give this move a 2.5 stars. It's watchable, but just barely."
1,Smokin Aces 2: hot steaming pile of - not worth watching,"Smokin Aces 2 Assassins Ball is missing more than two aces; its missing the whole deck of cards.Starting out in an FBI bunker interviewing one of their own who has a bounty on their head, they decide its not safe enough.So rather than stay put, everyone gets into the back of a van to take a drive to find a bunker hidden under a jazz bar out in the middle of nowhere.When the van arrives there are introductions all round, that include everyone's life story and history of the area (yes its history) to get through before the action starts.Now if your thinking (like me) after all of this tedious setting up, its going to be a shoot out (Assassins Ball) of epic proportions; think again!THE WHOLE MAIN ACTION LAST FOR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES!!"
1,Dont waste your time,"I get this movie because I had high expectation from the part 1, but I get dissapointed."
4,excellent detail but incomplete,"This book is written by several experts and is essentially a compilation of individual articles, each of which is outstanding in the detail of the direction given. However, for a person seeking to make a particular bow, all 3 books of the series are needed and there is not an orderly progression. Just count on buying all three, reading them all, making decisions based on what you've learned, and then picking chapters to help you as you go along."
4,Nice reference,Bought this for my son. It was just what he was looking for as a reference for bow building. He hasn't finished reading it yet.
3,bowyers bible ..my opinion,"this book has a lot of repeat info from he previous verson, but there are some new info also and in my opinion re reading something even re-worded is helpful in remembering was is put out.. no question these guy's know their stuff."
5,Finest.,"This volume is very explicative and not lost any details of his points. All the volumes makes a great help, and even a single powerfull source of information, to anyone who want to make the finest traditional bows, i recomend !"
4,bow building,"the book seems to be very informative,but it would be better if I had book one which I ordered at the same time if I knew it was going to take from May to July to get book one I would have gone elsewhere to buy.I could rate the book higher if I had book one that book two refers to.I give this 4 stars your service -4."
2,Lacks practical instructions,I bought Volume 1 and 2 of this series and hoped it would give lots of practical instruction on building a bow. The books were loaded with lots of historical stuff that was of little interest to me. I'm not sure how many more volumes i'd have to buy to get what I wanted. Not worth the price to me.
4,Native Plants of the N.E. by Donald Leopold,"I am in landscape design and wish to use native plants as much as possible. My yard has been certified by National Wildlife for years and everyone loves it. I needed to learn more about ""natives"" so I can incorporate them into designs. This book has been pretty helpful in this area. One problem with this is that plant width is NOT listed...only height. Also, it would be very helpful to have sections within the chapters. Trees and shrubs would be more useful if sectioned into size and evergreen or deciduous."
3,More like a seed catalog than a guide for gardening,"There aren't enough books of this genre, and so I hate to be harsh. Still, there could have been at least some information about gardening and conservation when the author discusses the individual plants. Instead, the author provides the type of shallow discussion one finds in a seed catalog. I would think that people who want to use native plants to garden would would want some information about a plant's ecology--at least enough to know where to site a plant."
5,A Great Reference,"I purchased this book following a gardening lecture on the importance of utilizing native plants. I'm very impressed with the quality - wonderful photographs, useful information and a great reference. Looking forward to gardening this spring!"
5,An Encyclopedia of Cast Iron Cooking Information,"I was amazed at how easy to follow and comprehensive this book is. I love the detailed history of Dutch ovens they give -- and the insights into all the different ways to cook with cast iron. I love to cook on my Camp Chef propane stove, but now I can also use my home oven. Amazing tips and ideas."
5,Most informative dutch oven cook book on the Market todate!!,"The introduction to dutch oven cooking is covered in more detail than any other book on the market, Charcoal plaacement is clearly exlained, and the book binding helps alot in that a spiral binding is so much easier to handle while cooking. A Truely great value."
1,Primitive Sound,"I found this a few weeeks ago on a $1 per disc cart in a local used book store, so I certainly can't complain about the price. Even at $2, I'd say don't bother. Sometimes it sounds like Callas through the sonic murk, but the recording is so bad I can't draw any conclusions about Callas' vocalism or her acting. Lionel Mapleson's century old Edison cylinder recordings taken down in the flies over the Met stage have more presence than this travesty. We can regret that Callas never commercially recorded this wildcat role in the days when she said she was ""singing like a wildcat."" This is no substitute for the might have been. Even the Rossini ""Armida"" with its AM static and infamous dropouts is better as a recording. Save your money to apply toward the numerous live recordings (of other roles) that better honor her art."
1,Poorly Written,"90% of the bulk content is unnecessary; very poor quality. Short on substance; very long winded. This is not a science textbook, but a verbose chat. NOT recommended."
5,Masterpiece!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! It has it all. The rise of this famous family, they were not always sucessful at what they did. How they became a dynasty, & synomous with Germany. Usually when you heard about one you heard something about the other. How they became so powerful, the arms they developed. Their enormous roles in 2 world wars in the 20th century. And their eventual fall. A little almost gossip like info is given about some family members, though this backed by records of their respective times. Could.easily have been titled the rise & fall of the Krupp dynasty. Not very boring."
3,Clipping Hurts,"FMW has demonstrated a dismaying fondness for clipping huge chunks out of their matches, disrupting the flow and probably depriving the viewer of some great spots. This volume trims a 12-minute barbed wire board and bat match to a little over 4 minutes. The fire death match (the ring ropes are replaced with barbed wire and rows of torches) is also trimmed to less than half its original length. The tape does feature 3 in-their-entirety matches of Japanese superstar Hayabusa, so I'll give it 3 stars. But FMW and Tokyopop should give us fewer matches and deliver them whole. Particularly the gimmick matches, which is FMW's main selling point."
1,Stupid,"I was highly disappointed with this dvd. The comentators were the worst ive ever heard, and the matches were not great. The hardcore matches were clipped and had no point to really watch them. They brag about being ""hardcore"" but there wasnt too much ""hardcore"" action. A few good matches here, but very short. Hayabusa is an exciting wrestler, but not as good as RVD. Sorry ""julabard"". The main event piting him against Awesome, was disappointing. Its partly the reason why I bought the dvd. I did like Super Leather though. Id like to see more of him. Not a really ""hardcore"" dvd, will have to look elsewhere."
1,One Star On A Value Basis,"As a program, Midsomer Murders is a solid offering. However, once sold as a product, ""value"" has to become a consideration in one's rating, and in my opinion $9 for one episode of an OK TV show from years ago is just nuts. Not worth it."
4,Fine British Police Series,"I have long enjoyed this quirky British mystery show with its over-the-top killings in a bucolic setting. Now that the shows are available for free with Prime membership, I can watch the shows in order - instead of randomly. It is a treat to see the very young John Nettles and see how much the show and the cast have matured over the years."
5,Midsomer Murder Series,"Can't say enough about this series. I LOVE all the shows. If you enjoy a Good mystery you'll Love these. I wish they were on TV more. I use to watch them on the Biography Channel. Now can't find them any where. So, Please buy them and Enjoy the BEST Mysteries Ever!Midsomer Murders, Set Three"
3,Enjoyable BUT...,"This is definitely an enjoyable series with great writing and good performances. However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The reasons that caused the villagers to murder others are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; like an 80 years old woman who is a retired school teacher, an angel-faced 14 years old girl etc. people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest..."
1,What Happened to ???,"I got through season 1 of this series and really loved it! Then I went to move on to season 2 and found that it is a ridicuous $8.99 per episode. Shame on you, Amazon for bait and switch!!"
1,Amazon - FAIL!,"After a long week I sat down on Friday night to relax and watch one of my favorite British mysteries. There I was with my glass of wine, propped up in bed ready to watch, and imagine my shock and horror to find that the series is no longer free to Prime Members! Amazon, what are you thinking?!?! It's a great show, but it makes no sense to go from free to $8.99 an episode.Boo Amazon, you let your Prime Members down!!"
1,Bad Amazon!,This was a big sell for signing up for Prime. Not a smart move to pull it and put such a high price. Why? Now I'm going to spend my money for Netfix.
1,so sad,"Huge, huge fan of the entire series. So sad removed from Prime, will NOT spend the unreasonable amount of money to buy! What happened?"
1,Disappointed,"No explaination about removing Midsomer Murders from ""Prime"".....Well back to recording it on PBS. What next .....charging for shipping? Changing the terms of an agreement without notice seem a little shady."
1,A very disappointing bait and switch by amazon,"I've always had good experiences with Amazon until now, but having just signed up for Amazon Prime--in part so that we could watch free episodes of Midsomer Murders--I see that they are suddenly charging a hefty fee to watch it--a very disappointing bait and switch. Fortunately, I'm still within my 30 day free trial period for Prime, so I will probably drop it."
2,Functional but not quite,"The piece is 3 compartments as promised, but it have no padding on the bottom. neither do the DOMKE camera bags, so while it protect my leica nicely from the sides, it have no protection for a rough landing of the camera bag. I solved the problem by cutting a strip of half inch closed cell foam for the bottom of my satchel bag... Not quite the product I had hoped but it does the trick with a little help."
4,Does what it should,"I needed to better organize my Domke f-803 and this insert does the job. Not fancy or super-padded, but an item like this you just put it in the bag and forget about it. The Domke offers enough padding for me around the outside, so I'm satisfied with the construction of this unit because it doesn't suck up space. It was worth it. Oh, and by careful placement it actually creates five spaces--on the ends I've arranged to have a slender place to put slim items. The hook-and-loop is really aggressive, however, so be prepared for a lot of fiddling at first if you want to get everything exactly right. If you're like me and just need it close enough, it's not much hassle."
3,Domke FA-230 3 Pricey For What You Get!!!!,"Pricey for what you get. A companion insert for the Domke Satchel Bags, I found it to be too limited for the equipment I use, (see my images), I have a Nikon D-90 with a 16-85 lens and Multi battery pack attached, and a 18-105 kit lens, 50mm lens in the main compartment of my Domke F-802 Photo journalist satchel. Quite frankly the insert seems to be good for lenses and small cameras (no DSLR's) only. you could squeeze a DSLR or a Rangefinder in the main compartment along with the insert but not with a battery pack attached.The unit doesn't seem to be built that well to me. The one I ordered was flawed and I am in the process of returning it. It's not the same build quality of the Domke bags...hmmmm. I'll make my own. The insert seems flimsy and the thin foam padding doesn't provide any major protection. The bag does that. IMHO I would pay $5.00 but not $20-$35.00 for this product. Not a necessity with the F-802."
3,All-star cast sing songs from the movie.,"This is one of few soundtracks that actually feature songs sang by the actors and actresses that played in the movie.So here you can hear Alan Alda, Woody Allen (who directed this musical), Goldie Hawn, Edward Norton, Billy Crudup, Julia Roberts, Patrick Crenshaw, Natasha Lyonne and Tim Roth(!) singin'. Drew Barrymore didn't sang, her voice was replaced by voice of Olivia Hayman. Well, I don't know why they didn't do the same with Julia Roberts, cause her singin' is horrible. Dick Hyman, who worked with Woody Allen on Bullets Over Broadway, too, arranged, produced and conducted the songs and played a few instruments on.But the soundtrack is kinda funny and that's good about it."
2,not up to carly's usual talent,"disappointed, love her new cd and no secrets, this is very different style for her"
1,stopped buying her albums after this one,"i liked the first 4 sung notes of ""The Blue of Blue"" but hated the rest of this album. after this one, i lost momentum, and never bought another carly simon album. except for her 1st one, all the albums prior to this were such winners; i was such a fan. not that i don't like old fogey music--i do--but i don't think it fits her. hotcakes, another passenger, boys in the trees, anticipation, spy i loved to death. but not this. i wouldn't waste your money unless you try the samples here and it strikes you better than it did me. sorry, carly."
3,Torch CD,"'Torch' is hard to find in CD shops , so was glad to find it , however the CD had a scratch or blemish on it, so I hear it every time I play the CD. It seemed well packaged on arrival. Thanks, Jackie"
4,A CARLY SURPRISE,"Far from the smooth pop she is known for, Carly's album Torch covers some of the most beloved torch standards of all time, and includes some lesser-known contemporary songs by noted songwriters (Not A Day Goes By, Sondheim). The revelation of this album is Carly's game interpretation of the material, which can -- and will -- survive without her; the vocals are assured, mature and in most cases completely captivating. A particular highlight is I Get Along Without You Very Well, which, though standard, was new to me on this album, and which conveys a haunting sadness. This is an album for the candles, low lights, etc. -- you get the idea. Good and enjoyable, if not classic -- for the same effect done without peer, try Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now, which makes nary a misstep."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"This movie was way better than I expected it would be. It had an surprising twist at the end end though I personally didn't like the sci-fi ending. Nevertheless, it's worth watching as it will keep your attention from the beginning to the end. Good movie!"
2,Disappointing,"Harris intends to extend the work of Bruggemann and others on the issue of Jubilee spirituality, but in my opinion fails. She is either unaware of how her biases play into the hermaneutic circle or doesn't care. She seems to assume that if one is seeking to follow God her argument is unassailable. This is not true.Admittedly my resistance in part is due to my own reading of history, politics and scripture and my biases are many. However, I felt she failed to attempt to engage those who operate from a different place. Her most interesting work was in refence to the Sabbath, and our need for the same."
3,it's alright,"from controversy,sexuality,do me baby this is a banging set but then it drops and doesn't pick up again until lets work comes on.still sounds good the standout cuts do."
4,UNDERRATED BUT GREAT,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF THE EARLY PRINCE ALBUMS IT IS WHERE IS FUSES NU WAVE WITH R&B; MUSIC TO FULL EFFECT LONG FUNK JAMS LIKE THE TITLE TRACK TO THE NU WAVE PUNK-FUNK OF ""SEXUALITY ""WITH IT'S BRILLIANT GUITAR LINES AND CALL TO ARMS LYRICS AND THE SLOW LOVE GROOVE OF THE CLASSIC ""DO ME BABY"" AND SONGS LIKE PRIVATE JOY, THE ROCK OF ""RONNIE TALK TO RUSSIA"" THE FUNK OF ""LET'S WORK""THE ABSTRACTION OF ""ANNIE CHRSITIAN"" AND THE BLUES ROCK OF ""JACK U OFF"" THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF OLD PRINCE AND THE COMING OF THE FUTURE AONE ALBUM LATER BUT PEOPLE GET THIS ALBUM IT IS AN UNDERRATED GEM FROM A BIG PRINCE FAN."
4,I wanna be in the New breed! Stand up! Organize!,"If you know what my title means (from the cut ""Sexuality""), you've heard this album. LOVE the procussion from that tune.Prince's 4th album, released in 1981, was easily the most exciting R&B; album of that year. The mixture of rock and R&B; was revolutionary for the times, but this album was relatively unknown outside of Black teenagers in some cities. It's important to remember that Prince was largely an underground cult artist until 1999 (the album, not the year).Pretty exciting stuff. Musically, he expands upon ""Dirty Mind's"" formula of Rock and R&b; powered anthems of sex, religion (the use of the Lord's prayer in the title cut caused outrage in many quarters), and social commentary. The content of the songs hass been well commented upon by the other reviewers. Just hear for yourself and think.The original Lp had a bizarre poster of Prince in the shower next to a crucifix, which added to the title of this album living up to it's name."
3,so/so,"this disc starts off strong with the title track,sexuality&do me baby then goes down and doesn't pick up again until lets work.it's basically dirty mind part 2 with less shock but more groove.but nothing on the order of 1999."
2,very spotty,"I had the tape in high school when it first came out and I bought the CD very recently for two songs in particular. The first, the title track, is a classic. The last track ""Jack U Off"" is a weird and wonderful mix of electro keyboards, New Wave-ish rhythms, a sing-song melody, and incredibly raunchy lyrics. The remainder of the album is for me, forgetable."
5,[RUDE BOY],"I just can't say enough great things about Prince. A musical prodigy. Genius. A voice so beautiful and what a range. Well, Controversy did just that, in causing some: From the high-heels, to the leg warmers, to the tights, people were trippin. Lyrics like, ""Am I black or white, am I straight or gay?"" raised some eyebrows. Jabs were taken at religion (""Annie Christian"") and politics (""Ronnie, Talk To Russia""). Prince is like a diamond with many facets. Mazy, toying with our emotions and imaginations, while having a ball and laying down some funky phat grooves that will blow your mind!My favorites are: ""Controversy"" (One of the greats)/""Sexuality"" (Slammin')/""Do Me, Baby"" (Sexy, erotic, blissful)/""Private Joy"" (Sublime)/""Let's Work"" (Stinky funk bass thumpin' velocity)/""Jack U Off"" (Go out with a bang!)"
3,The Title Track Skips,"I played this for the first time and th title track skips. Amazon graciously replaced it and the replacement skips on the exact same parts. Needless to say, there is a kink in the production of this album. I have all of the other Prince 180 Gram Vinyl albums and they do not have this issue. It is unfortunate because Controversy is my favorite track. It's nice that they include the poster that came in the original release."
4,Classic Prince at his best!,"What else can I say about this CD? This picks up where his previous 1980 CD ""Dirty Mind"" left off. In fact I think both CDs should be sold together as a set because they are soo much alike in style and funkiness. Controversy the song is my jam! All 7 minutes and 14 seconds of it! I also love the song ""Jack U Off"". It took awhile to have that song grow on me but when it did I didn't take it as being vulgar I just took it as being a trip and downright funny! ""Let's Work"" is gritty street funk at it's best- bass lines and all! ""Do Me Baby"" is self explanatory and just off the hook and meant for a true night of passion!A classic CD to have if you are a true old school Prince fan!"
3,Some Good Some Bad,"This album starts off strong, with three great tracks - the sums-it-all-up title track, the interesting ""Sexuality"", and ""Do Me Baby"", which every smoove R&B artist has tried to top for the last 15 plus years. From then on, it gets rather spotty. ""Private Joy"" sounds like an item from his first two albums. ""Ronnie Talk to Russia"" is Prince's first (and probably worst) attempt at social commentary. ""Let's Work"" is great funk. ""Annie Christian"" is a (deliberately?) confused number which still sounds cool. ""Jack U Off"" is anything-but-harmless fun. A spotty album which pales next to his best stuff, but is worth a listen anyhoo."
4,Classic,"Prince, in his more rock element. It was easy to listen to this one and see him rising as a huge force on the music scene. His sexual allusions were considered risqué, then he matured into full-on sonar pr0n. Not a bad way to spend a decade."
5,the best...,"some of his best work from back in the day, lov it, lov it lov it to death....lov to all diva'"
5,new in town,"I remember this cd, or record back in the day. When I'd first moved to this state. It was pretty good then and it still is to this day. Since then I've always been a Prince fan."
4,The Definitive Early Prince,"I was a senior in high school when this album came out and I remember it like yesterday. This was before Prince really blew up and began to move away from his r&b roots in order to gain a bigger audience. Songs such as the orgasmic ""Do Me Baby""(who can forget the obvious satisfied sounds of a young lady in the middle of this song),the upbeat ""Private Joy"", and the funky beat of ""Lets Work"" show a genius on the verge of superstardom."
4,Impressive Music,"This mixes elements of various types of music - particularly, rock and Middle Eastern - into a flow that is jazz-like but not jazz. Beyond just being a complex stew, the music is pleasing and challenging. It's much less dry and more engaging than most music of this ""type"" (third world meets jazz fusion would be a cynical way to describe this sonic palette).One sonic reference point is King Crimson, circa 1981-84. The opening track sounds like some type of Robert Fripp experiment circa 1979 as played by the 1984 band. I mean this as a compliment. This sounds a bit like the Crimson of ""The Sheltering Sky"" but playing compositions with more changes in them.The quality of the recordings is quite nice, a strong clear sound.Why buy it? Because it nicely balances aggression and adrenaline with relaxation and an etherial quality, and because it's musically interesting. Why not buy it? I can't see any reason not to."
4,Great Budget Speakers,I used these to replace some worn out door spaekers in my truck. For the money they are a great purchase.
1,Less Than Miraculous,"I'm sorry to say that I was quite disappointed in this book. It was recommended to me by a friend who said they loved it and thought it was the best thing since Zakov's ""Seat of the Soul"". I would recomment Zacov's latest, ""Soul Stories"" instead of this depressing tome. I also recommend, of course, ""Seat Of The Soul"", as well."
2,Not like seeing them live.,"I've seen them live. I thought this would be a good DVD for my strings classes. The students lost interest quickly, unlike when other students have seen them live. I think the DVD needs to be redone. I don't recommend it."
2,Barrage - A Total Let Down,Barrage will end up in my garage. There was no variety in their presentation. I loved the music but the stage show was extremely unoriginal. I felt cheated because the excitement displayed on the DVD cover was misleading.
4,"Excellent show, misleading DVD contents label","Barrage puts on a powerhouse of a show that will get your hands clapping and your feet tapping. The performers are very gifted, and it's clear that they love performing for an audience. This is a show you'll want to view again and again.The DVD is a great addition to anyone's collection, but don't be mislead by the label. It says that the DVD contains two bonus features: ""Documentary"" and ""Biography"". It actually contains neither. The ""Documentary"" is a documentary PROMO that gives just a couple minutes worth of the actual documentary of their tour of Europe. Presumably the real documentary will be available as a separate title in the future. The ""Biography"" is just a few static screens that tells nothing about the individual members of the group; it's really more about the production company..."
5,Fiddle sensation!,"Being a violin player myself, I am always on the lookout for good violin music. I am open to all styles of music, from classical and jazz to rap and heavy metal. One day, I picked up the remote and started channel surfing. I stopped when I saw this group of musicians performing really catchy music. I fell instantly in love with them. As soon as I could, I bought the CD and DVD, and did everything I possibly could to see them live! I bought the Barrage sheet music, and was first in line to get autographs. I was so psyched to meet them. Most people heard the word 'violin' and they think, ew classical music [stinks], but this is quality music. It's a fusion of everything you could possibly do on the violin. I highly recommend Barrage to anyone who is a fan of music!"
3,I did not care for this volume.,"This book only contains brief biographies from five winan pejuta (medicine women), but does not teach the spiritual beliefs of these medicine women.If you want to read about some of the abilities of medicine and holy people this would be a fairly good place to start.If you want to understand the spiritual beliefs, and possibly work toward becoming a medicine or holy person; look elsewhere.My Indian, and Shamanism listmania lists can help you in that search for spiritual beliefs of the American Indians.I encourage questions and comments about reviews; Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
4,Good stuff,"For some reason it is hard to find the Uncle Ben's Original. This is just as good, but a bit different in flavor, and reasonably priced. Just wish the packaged rice makers would lay off the insane amount of salt. I only used packed rice boxes if I am in a real hurry. Usually make my own, much less expensive.The secret to making your own rice like this is plenty of dried parsely and garlic. Heck of allot cheaper and no hypertension salt."
1,Not what I thought,"Bought this for my teenage son to see if he would be interested in playing the drums. This pad has no sound what-so-ever. It sounds just like you're drumming on a box, at most."
2,"nice drum action, but LOUD!","I bought this Remo practice pad via Amazon, so I didn't try it out before buying. It is LOUD! I might as well be playing a snare drum. I wasn't comfortable practicing without hearing protection. The drumming action on it is nice, though.Because I didn't like the Remo, I bought an Evans Real Feel, which is MUCH quieter, and has two materials for different rebound action (it's REALLY nice!!)...so now the Remo is a dust collector. I'd recommend not getting the Remo and spend the extra money on an Evans Real Feel (2-sided) RF12D."
2,If you supplement this with some actual cardio...it's ok,"Disappointing. I don't know how this man sweats as much as he does with such a low level of intensity! This does focus on arms, which is cool, because if you use light weights (I use 2 lb) it's good to sculpt and not build. To supplement, I will stop the dvd after each exercise and do 20-30 jack flies, 180 jumps, cross country skiing, or anything plyo. Also, he does many very slow reps, so instead of doing the slow version, I will just go right into the quick version. If you can do that, it's not so bad. If you are a beginner, this is a good dvd for you. Otherwise, you will definitely have to add some intensity on your own."
1,NOT GOOD!,"I was a fan of Billy Blanks taebo workouts, so I was excited for this new DVD. It was truly awful. It is almost 90% focused on arms. It barely has 'real' cardio. The moves - with the weights - are WAY TOO FAST - for even very experienced exercisers. I would absolutely NOT recommend this DVD to anyone."
4,Good weight lifting & cardio workout!,"I just completed this workout this morning. I had gotten a good workout & a great sweat. If your looking for a a good cardio explosion with the combination of weights, then this is the perfect video for you."
1,The Worst Holmes I've ever seen.,This movie is essentily a bad remake of many of the Basil Rathbone movies.This movie rips off several ideas from the Rathbone movies.here are just a few of the rip offs as follows.-Moriarty escapes being hanged(Adventures of S. H. where Moriarty is aquited of murder)-Woman hypnotises lord(The Woman In Green. this movie even reuses the bowl with water and flowers)and there are others I am sure.not only does this movie represent the Rathbone storys in a bad way but the plot and story are boringeven the actors seemed bored of what they are doing.many of the story elements are just plain dull.holmes pretends to be deadjust to catch Moriarty placing a reath on his suposed grave stone.If you want Sherlock Holmes watch a good Rathbone movieor some of Jermey Brett's early Holmes's work.anything but this!
3,enjoyable mystery,I enjoyed this version of Sherlock Holmes. It was well made and the actors gave excellent portrayals. I would recommend this dvd to all who like good mysteries.
5,Best out there,I you use your grill to cook burgers and hot dogs...sell your grill.Be a man...spend 9 bucks and learn to grill like a pro
4,BBQ guide,I have been looking for this type of book for awhile.I have a Weber kettle grill and am starting to really get into using it to get the real smokey flavors from cooking on the grill.This book has many of the new cooking skills I will need to cook right.
4,Decent Recipes.,This is not the best beginner's barbecue / grilling book. It's not nearly as informative as Weber's Big Book of Grilling but it is decent read. The recipes in it aren't as basic the Big Book of Grilling but they are still pretty good if you are looking for something new to grill. If you already own Weber's Big Book of Grilling and are considering getting this one to then I wouldn't tell you not to get it. I've certainly seen worse.
4,Real Grilling,Very good book. Similar to the BIG Book of grilling. Has all of the basic cooking charts and new recipes.
5,perfect book,"This is the only grilling book you need, perfect for my new Baby Q, I have not had a bad meal since I started using this book.All my grilled food is perfect, but I now cook with a stop watch!The introduction and the grilling charts make this book worth ten dollars I have read severa grilling books, but always come back to this one. the pictures are wonderful and recipes are doable with a great vareity."
5,The Best!,"Jamie Purviance and Weber have delivered one of the best grilling books on the market! Jamie is a real pro and it shows. The recipes, tips on grilling techinques, and beautiful photographs are all superb. Whether you're a weekend enthusiast or a serious charcoal griller, you will love this book and everything between the front page and last!"
4,Weber's Real Grilling,"Great book on grilling. The recipes I've tried so far all taste great. However, some other reviewers have stated that the binding is not of the best quality and the book is falling apart. I think that they may be right. After about a month of use, I can see signs of this so I am being a bit carefull with it for now. I only paid about $5 for this new here so I won't complain too much, I'm satisfied. I would be a bit upset however if I had paid the MSRP and it was falling apart."
3,Grilling Technology,I lost my Weber cookbook during our move from Illinois to Florida. I ordered this cook book as a replacement for the one that was lost.
5,Excellent recipes with common ingredients,"My sister and her husband got this book and after eating so many delish meals at their house, I bought this book too. Every recipe is so good, and the ingredients are common spices you probably already have in your pantry. The rubs are excellent, and again with common ingredients. My favorite recipe is the Cedar Planked Salmon...I have made it every weekend since I first discovered the recipe. We have made chicken, beef, pork and fish and this book has not let us down. If you like to BBQ...this is a must have."
5,Love IT!!,"This cook book is a joy! And I should know...my family has been collecting cook book's for generations. The photos are appealing, the variety is very good, the recipes are step by step...even through the basics we sometimes forget! I have recommended this book to friends and family and plan to give it as gifts (perfect gift for a summer occasion)."
5,Excellent book,"My grilling went from mediocre to great (according to friends) with the help of this book. It provides recipes for most kinds of meat, clearly explains how to pick out the meat, the basics of rubs and marinades, and most importantly exactly how to cook the meat. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves to grill!"
3,Decent,"I bought this book when I first started grilling as a young adult. It definitely taught me a decent amount about how to grill and has a few recipes in it that are worthwhile, but other than the fact that it looks nice on my kitchen counter I would not buy it again."
2,"Great recipes, terrible binding",I love the recipes.The book is full of great information.The binding is terrible as all the pages are coming out of the book.And there is no room to 3 hole punch the pages and put them in a binder.
5,GREAT BOOK,"Wow, what a great book. Tons of recipes for items that you actually want to cook. Great presentation and easy to follow. I am a long time griller and I discovered tons of new ideas. What a difference it made in my meals."
5,Best grilling book,"Real Grilling was recommended to me by a Beef Farm. This books tells you a million different ways to prep meat (rub, marinade, etc.) and then how long to cook. I am a Paleo eater (no grains, corn, soy, or dairy) and love this book - will never need another grilling book. The greatest part about this book is that you DO NOT have to run to the store to buy exotic ingredients."
5,Excellent Book,My husband bought this book and a Weber charcoal grill some five months ago. He has cooked probably one quarter of the recipes already and the vast majority of them have turned out absolutely wonderful. He has found the basic guidance on barbecuing that is given in the introduction and throughout the book particularly helpful. This is an excellent book!
5,Lost History is a MUST HAVE book for dog lovers!,"I got Mary Thurston's THE LOST HISTORY OF THE CANINE RACE, expecting to learn some interesting bits about the heritage of our best friends. What I found was all that and so much more. From the mysterious circumstances surrounding the emergence of dogs at the end of the Ice Age, to a profoundly eloquent examination of canine ""history in the making"" and the emergence of a global pet society on the advent of the 21st century. Ancient Egyptian dog mummies, medieval Turnspits, Victorian dog shows, the valiant American K9 Corp of WWII, and so much more. Beautifully illustrated throughout, The Lost History offers something for everyone who's ever lived with a dog, pure or mixed breed. A must-have addition to pet libraries everywhere, this book has changed the very core of my relationship with canines."
4,Works Well!,I've had this juicer for a year now. It works pretty well. There are 2 main reasons I didn't give it 5 stars though.1) the little handle griper always falls off2) sometimes seeds still get throughOther than those 2 complaints it's true to it's product description. I still recommend this product and it makes juicing of any kind a breeze!
3,Very Tiny,"This is a cute pendant, but it is extremely small, also the length of the necklace was not long enough."
4,curious cat,"A primer on accepting the wholeness of life to include death, a fascinating subject that I have no knowledge of- though perhaps understanding- now. Obviously meant for those who have experienced loss but not limited to only they. I'm looking forward to reading more from her."
1,An extreme disservice to Scleroderma patients,"Dr. Mayes's book gives a well-written account of how scleroderma progresses in a patient unabated. However, to subtitle this book ""A Guide for Patients and Families"" is grossly inaccurate. Dr. Mayes misses the mark when she fails to discuss or even mention antiboitic therapy as a treatment. Her condescending advice on coping with scleroderma was particularly distasteful."
3,Sturdy tomatoes for a broad variety of basic uses,"Sturdy tomatoes for a broad variety of basic uses like sauces, soups, and so on. They have citric acid in them, but they do not have an overwhelming, canned taste."
5,Good pantry item,this is healthy and convenient to add to dishes that need a little something else to lighten or brighten the flavor and to dilute salt content.
5,Great!,These tomatoes are great! They have more flavor than conventional canned diced tomatoes and have more color. They are much better than non-organic tomatoes of various brands that I've had.
1,Not very happy this time.,"I was very excited when I read reviews about the product. I read about the product with an expiration code of March 2013 will be BPA free.I waited for a while to order this product for that reason.All cans I received were ""Expired January 2013"", and yes, it is BPA liner in.Maybe the Amazon warehouse had a lot of stock of the products, but I could not believe the canned food I received has expire date within 6 months."
1,"Disappointed, Still have BPA","The shipping box was damaged, 6 of the 12 cans were dented and most diappointing is I received old cans that still have the BPA lining. I read other reviews before ordering and see that other people have received the BPA free cans. I guess my distribution center still has the old stock so be careful!"
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting this product to be small diced tomato squares (like the kind that you put on tacos). Instead it was more like randomly chopped chunks of tomato. Its packed with lots of water, and has a slightly off taste. If you google ""how to dice tomatoes"" you will probably see various videos on how to properly dice a tomato - do not expect this product to be anything close to that. I feel misled.I can see this being used for making tomato sauce or soups - basically for cooking."
5,A Raucous Romp,"I saw this show off broadway four years ago and it was absolutely fabulous. I laughed, I cried, and laughed some more. The more I reminisce, the more outrageous the show became. Mostly laughed . . . out loud . . . a LOT. The lyrics are unquestioningly imaginative. And the music never ceases to lift my spirits. The whole production allowed me to celebrate being gay in a way I've never experienced before. I was profound proud to be queer. And I still cherish that feeling."
5,An up in the air musical that never comes down,"Witty, imaginative, thought provoking, humable- in a word unforgetable. The world lost a brilliant talent with the death of Howard Crabtree. An of course big Bravos to Dick Gallagher and Mark Waldrop and the entire cast. I can't say which is my favorite number because all of them are great, but special mention to The title number, Laughing Matters, and Sam and Me. Get this cd - you won't be disappointed."
5,Great!,"It's amazing so many of these issues remain with the GLBT+ community still. There are tiny bits of progress now and then, but the movement still falls short of acceptance. That's a shame."
2,It's a binder,"For the price, the binder didn't stand out as high quality. It's an average binder that you would see at Staples. You can't get this one there, but I was anticipating a little more quality look for the price. The binder doesn't fall closed without zipping it up when you're at a table. It's a little stiff. I will not pay this price for one of these again."
4,A solid second season,"David Tennant is my favourite Doctor.How's that for a starter? Billie's not my favourite companion (that would be Martha Jones from series 3, though Amy Pond may well take that title), but everybody's love for her is easily understandable.Series 2 comes out swinging. It becomes very clear from the very beginning that this Doctor is not a patient man, or forgiving. When the Doctor gives you 'one warning', you take it. ""No second chances."" That comes out quite a bit through-out Tennant's run as the Doctor, he's a fighting Doctor.If you're a fan of Doctor Who, you need this series. If you're not a fan, this is the most likely series to change your mind."
5,why review what you already know is great,"The Second Seasons is great, the music, the stories, and well The Girl in the Fireplace is a masterpiece !!! I hope the 10th Doctor never regenerates !!!"
5,Doctor Who - Sci-Fi at it's best!,"Again, after just one season, a new doctor. I lovedChristopher Eccleston so I was a bit sceptic but David Tennant is an awesome doctor. Just as the first season, great stories, great acting and also the special effect are very good.When Doctor Who came back in 2005, I liked it, since then I love it, it isvery addictive.Also english subs is handy."
5,"Doctor Who, second season","David Tennant is the best Doctor since Tom Baker. If you're a Doctor Who fan, you should buy this dvd set immediately. If you're not a Doctor Who fan, buy this and you will be!"
1,BUYER BEWARE - SELLER: AMAZING DISCOUNTS/DE,"I would like to warn all you potential buyers against purchasing this product from Amazing Discounts/DE (Fantasy Video Store)!I recently purchased Doctor Who Season 4 from them, and what they sent me was not a legitimate US copy. There were misspellings, different sized type, and commas where apostrophes should be. I promptly left negative feedback for the seller and returned the item through Amazon. Two days after I left the feedback, they emailed me asking me to change it. I ignored the email, and the seller proceeded to call my house on a DAILY basis trying to get me to remove the feedback I left.If you are not satisfied with your purchase, they will harass you until you remove your (honest) feedback! DO NOT BUY FROM Amazing Discounts/DE (Fantasy Video Store)!"
3,Doctor Where?,"Amazon prompted me to write a review. The promised arrival date has passed, and the TARDIS is TARDY! Only one day passed at this point. I'm a patient person."
3,cheated by Amazon,"Two of the disks were scratched and unplayable. Tried THREE TIMES to exchange, but a glitch prevents Amazon from acknowleding my order, though it seems to go through and prints out the mail stuff, and my ""return window"" closes today. Guess I'll have to shell out another $70 and try again! Thanks, Amazon!"
3,DVD Production problems,"On my disk the last scene of episode 2: New Earth is missing. Instead the disk cuts to a gory scene from what appears to be ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacure"". Looking at the DVD menue I see that the last scene was title ""Time to Die"". I can only guess that the manufacturer of the DVD inserted a simularly titled scene from another movie. Parents be warned, the scene in question is NOT for children."
5,Great fun for the family,"Being a parent who was a fan of the original Dr. Who I was looking forward to introducing my kids (10 and over) to this series. Everyone loves it! It's clever, fast-paced, thought-provoking, funny and emotional; a great talking point.We loved the first series with Christopher Ecclestone but this one with David Tennant has reached new heights. Some of the episodes can be scary so probably not for younger kids but it's all done in such a smart and intelligent way. British natives will spot some clever references that had me chuckling.Highly recommended!"
5,Dr. Who Review,This is my favorite doctor - even better than Tom Baker! The only show I am not thrilled with is Love and Monsters
3,Who's your Doctor?,Season one of the show in reincarnated form wasn't bad. The older Doctor had an air of experience and wisdom. Season two's younger version of the Doctor seems to lack that. The actor has his own humor and twist to the character. We'll have to see how the season and series progress with him in the role.
3,Another caveat on physical quality assurance,"As a Dr.Who newbie, it is difficult to compare this incarnation of the Dr. with others, although I do find David Tennant's acting engaging, just a bit 'over the top' which seems to fit the persona.My main complaint is that one of the six disks sent in my product was unreadable by two different DVD players. Looking at it, it seems as if nothing had been written on the disk. It looks 'blank', compared to the others. My warning is that you check your disks as soon as you receive the package and request a new set before any ""grace"" period expires.I am also a bit surprised that there are only two or three episodes per disk, when many TV dvd editions have four episodes on a disk."
2,"All surface, no feeling","I found this series almost painful to watch at times. Dr Who was always great ""cheesy"" fun, but this new version takes itself far too seriously at times - making the cheese-factor something you laugh AT, rather than laugh along with. There are far too many episodes in London (it feels like a council promo at times...) and some of the supporting characters are hugely annoying - especially Mickey, who often had me cheering for the bad guys in the hope that the annoying little so-and-so would get killed in some hilarious (and preferably gory) fashion.On the plus side; David Tennant is perfect as the Doctor, and Billie Piper is also fantastic as the down-to-earth and likable sidekick - they have a great chemistry. Some of the visuals are excellent, and occasionally it does actually hit the mark when trying to be poignant.Unfortunately, this show misses a whole lot more than hits for me."
2,A lot of flash and sfx but not a lot of substance,"I watched the second series, and it's decent, but so much of it is just flashy special effects and endless running. Gone is the thoughful writing of the past Doctor Who series. I guess if this is what people want, then fine, it will sell. But to me it's all rather hollow and anti-climatic. ""Oh, another freaky monster... any minute now, they'll start running again"", etc...I don't know... it just seems like with the earlier Doctors, the writing was so much more substantial. The acting was also a ton better.Plus what's the deal with the Daleks oversaturating the Eccleston/Tennant series?Ah well, my two cents."
1,This is just not good stuff,"I'm sorry, I'm a Doctor Who fan of old, and this new stuff just isn't it. The old Doctor Who of the 1960s and '70 may have had cheesy sets and lousy acting, BUT THE STORIES WERE GOOD! Most of these new stories are weak; ""Love and Monsters"" was one of the worst shows I have ever seen, in any series, much less Doctor Who. I would have utterly embarassed, if I were BBC, to put that show on the air. This teary, sappy, emotional stuff just doesn't work, it's not Doctor Who. And why so many episodes on earth? That's not Doctor Who, either. This guy travels, his Tardis takes him where he doesn't know where, not to London in different time periods. David Tennant is ok as a Dcotor Who; Billie Piper can't do anything well but cry. This soap opera stuff has got to go.If you are an old Doctor Who fan and haven't tried these new series yet, you'll be disappointed if you do. This stuff reeks, just bad stories, that's all there is to it."
1,Dreadful...,"David Tennant's mugging doesn't help the tired, repetitive scripting. Apart from the magnificent The Girl in the Fireplace, a bland rehash of the first season. They would've been better off cancelling the series after Christopher Eccleston's perfect season."
3,Never enough time,"I haven't had time to unwrap this item yet, much less watch it, but I'm sure it's very good."
2,please do research on this hoax,I have a difficult time believing that this book is not openly discussed as a hoax in the Amazon description. This is a shame. I agree that the story is powerful but it really loses almost everything when you know it is NOT a true story. Amazon needs to get up to date on this book and author!!! Shame on you.
2,Ionic Technology,"I'm suspicious of the Ionic feature on this brush. There's no way to tell if it does anything. The button on the brush would be a nice feature for removing hair, if it worked better than what it does....it's hard to get it to work and I'm afraid it might break. Other than that, the brush itself appears to work ok., but this product is made cheaply and could be better than what it is."
5,Superb rendition of a difficult work.,"A transparent, incredibly thoughtful rendition of Rachmaninoff's masterpiece. Every note shines in Byron Janis' spectacular playing of this most difficult of concertos, backed by one of true geniuses of music: Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony at its apex. Flawless, brilliant recording. A must."
5,excellent,"This is an awesome book. Simply written, easy read, with a complicated plot. Love, murder, mystery, and intrigue. Should be the next blockbuster by James Camron!!! I breathlessly await Janine Simpson's next book."
5,action and suspense,"For someone who is not a regular reader, this was a good book that kept my interest and was hard to put down!"
1,Disappointing,"Although this video has some classic elements, I felt it promoted some negative things. As I watched it with my two-year-old I felt uneasy about some of the ways the original stories were played out. He sat mesmerized, but I couldn't help but to think he would learn some negative lessons fom the way the stories were told. There are three fairy tales on the video, and I do think ""The 3 Little Pigs"" was the one that did the most justice to the classic storylines."
3,Love Kerastase,"I do like this product, however it's not what I ordered or wanted. I wanted the holding mist spray, as indicated, but I got the Serum instead. Two totally different products. The seller blamed Amazon for the online description being inaccurate. I am not thrilled with the seller and won't buy from them again. As they knew about this problem and blamed Amazon and wouldn't send me want I wanted without me having to return the wrong product and pay for returning the item. Poor customer service."
5,New and classic band music,"After listening to this CD, you will have a greater appreciation for band music The original music written for the movie will find your foot tapping,especially those marches and then the somber original music evokes the true plight of the coalminers. Of course, slightly rearranged for the movie, the classical numbers are so well played and recorded, you feel like you are there in the movie with the musicians. Must buy for band afficinado's and a must see movie."
3,Easy listening CD,"It is a good complement to a Greatest hits album, contains themes such as ""easy"" and others not included elsewhere."
5,My First Taste of Brother Al...,"It was my 2nd year of High School and as I was trying to do homework and my older brother threw on this album he'd just purchased. I thought wonderful, he's going to wreck my concentration now, hope he keeps the volume down! But of course, he didn't, couldn't! As I sat there, I suddenly realized I couldn't concentrate because of the music! I was hooked instantly! Found myself toe tapping, finger popping and just swaying with the melodies! My favorites on this classic masterpiece are: Teach Me Tonight and Roof Garden! There have been many wanna-be Al's over the years, but there is still only one!My older brother introduced me to some great music in those days and this is one of those Classic Masterpieces!"
4,My introduction to Al Jarreau,"Breaking Away was released in the early 80's and I was a senior high school student who bought the tape on the strength of the song ""Breaking Away"". I never regreted it. Some of Al's finest work in included here and should you be looking for a first CD to sample his work, THIS is the one!"
5,Jarreau's best,"This is definitely one of my favorite albums and the 1st album I got introduced by him. He really can sing, scat, and do whatever u can think. This album is way off the top who loves the sound of smooth jazz. I still have it on LP and cassette. But sooner or later I get it on CD ASAP. Peer to me, Al Jarreau would always be my mentor growing up in jazz since I got involved with others like Grover, Donald Byrd, Miles, Dizzy, Wynton, Guru, Impromp2, Anita, and everybody else. The most thing I like 'bout this album is that it gives me the craves, know I'm mean. It's so relaxed, so jazzy, so mixed with funk, a lil hip-hop in between. Also features the introduction to the Dave Brubeck classic ""Blue Rondo a la Turk"" from his 1959 most-classified album TIME OUT which I may go pick up. Yeah this always be Jarreau's best breakthrough ever 'cuz it'll rock the nation of pop history."
3,Few garden walks,"With too-slick delivery and production, the amiable dateables nobly caters to risque waiting-room enthusiasts."
2,"Cute, but not durable, practical for toddlers","These are cute shoes, but my 3-year-old came home from school after her first day wearing these shoes, and threads were already pulling from the seams.Within a week, the suede-like fabric that covers most of the shoe had already discolored to gray (and it wasn't dirt). I used a brush and suede cleaner (no soap or water), and it didn't help. They looked very old and worn out after only one week.Also, during the course of a regular outside play at school, she managed to tear the fabric completely off the toe, revealing the beige toe underneath the suede. Her toes were still protected, but it looked terrible. This isn't necessarily due to faulty manufacture; it's just that kids scuff the toes of their shoes.In summary, these would probably be fine for fashion wear, but I wouldn't recommend for school. In total, they lasted us about a month before I had to throw them away."
1,"""absolutely horrible""",After five months the tank started leaking and has ruined my carpet; and i have spent so much money on fish because they can't breath good and have died. i'm at a complete lost because i've had to sent the tank back at my expense. I highly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on this tank!!!
1,HORRIBLE Design,"If you like fish, this is NOT the tank for you. Fish need surface area, where the water comes in contact with air, for aeration of their water. Tall, narrow tanks, generally, are a bad idea, and this one looks particularly foolish."
1,"Excellent binoc's, but a long wait to get them","The quality of these binoculars is outstanding. I was unable to judge this in my previous review of this product, which was due to frustration over the long wait for them (almost 5 months from the time I ordered). I presume the delay was due to large demand for these particular binoc's, especially after being a top pick in CR Magazine just before the holiday season in December.The binoculars are adjustable for people who wear glasses, a very nice feature. They were worth the wait!My rating of the binoc's is 5 stars; for the wait, no stars."
5,Love these binoc's,"Have used this product for two weeks and love them. Great optics, light weight, nice case and easy to focus. Recommended"
5,Just what I needed,I ordered these binoculars for birdwatching with my 5 year old grandson and they are a perfect size for both of us and very light weight. They are easy to adjust and just what I was looking for so we could use them together. These were recommended by Consumer Reports as a Best Buy and they had compared them to other more expensive models - so I was really pleased that they were very affordable.
4,Nice binoculars,Nice binoculars...I wasn't expecting them to be completely plastic. They are not cheap plastic though if that counts for anything...
2,Mildly Disappointed,"OK, I guess. I don't know much about binoculars, except that there is a lot to see from the windows of my San Francisco apartment. My mother gave me a pair years ago in the 70s. I didn't realize they could be so small. These would be great for use in the theater or opera. The resolution is good, but it's difficult to get adjusted to your eyes. I would prefer a larger product."
5,Great binoculars,"I bought these for use at the US Open in San Diego last June. They were everything I hoped they would be: light, easy to carry in my pocket, easy to focus, and provided clear, sharp viewing. This is one of the best online purchases I have ever made. I highly recommend them."
5,Excellent value,"I purchased these for use as ""opera glasses"" rather than for field use. Their light weight (6 oz) makes them easily portable even in a light jacket, though the case comes with a pass-through for attaching to a belt. The clarity and ease of use is typical for Olympus (and above average overall). Next year my sister and her family are going to Africa, and they will be taking them on safari. I have found no shortcomings in my use of them thus far. I would recommend these for anyone but the hardest-core, long distance binocular user."
3,good for the size,"A quarter of a century ago I bought a pair of Nikon Action binoculars that produced a simply stunning image - bright, contrasty, sharp. I was hoping for the same from a new pair of RC-1s, but that was not to be the case - I would describe the image as adequate, but not stunning. The great advantage of these is that they are small and light. But if you want the kind of image a full sized pair of field binoculars can produce, you'll have to put up with their weight and size, because these don't do it. Why Consumer Reports has been so enthusiastic about them is a mystery to me, but they tested a whole bunch of them - maybe this is the best of the lot."
4,Very Satisfied,I was very impressed with the power and clarity of these binoculars as well as the ease of carrying them around. Used them on an Alaskan cruise and were very satisfied. I was glad I took the time to research the different binoculars using Consumer Reports and was able to find the exact model on Amazon.
5,These binocs are a good pick.,"I love these binocs. Very light and compact, and they work quite well. I've had larger binoculars in the past that are heavy and clunky - and it seemed I could never see well with them using both eyes at once. The Olympus Outback 8x21 binoculars work well, are not tricky to use, and are easy to take anywhere."
4,outstanding little binocular,"These are very good, amount of light is much better than other compacts, easy to adjust to a very crisp picture, and incredibly light and small. Genuinely, they are pocket sized. I didn't think I would like the fact that the neck strap attached to only one side, so that the binoculars hang asymmetrically, but find they are less obnoxious that way, less likely to hang on fence, brush, etc. My only objection is that they are not waterproof. The pouch they came in is hard to slide into my pocket, so when it begins to rain, I put them in a small plastic bag I carried folded in my pocket. I also bought the Nikon Travelite at the same time, and they are not as bright, and a bit bulkier."
2,Disappointed and Will be Returning,"I received a pair of the Nikon Action 7 x 50 binoculars for Christmas and was a little disappointed that they were so large, even though the picture quality was excellent. Since I wanted something a lot smaller and was willing to sacrifice a little picture quality, I decided to order this product (Olympus 8 x 21 RC I Outback) thinking that I would return the Nikon pair.Man, I didn't realize how much picture quality and comfort I would be sacrificing. After receiving the Olympus pair, I compared them both side by side and it was a no-brainer. The difference in image clarity, image brightness, comfort level (both holding the binoculars and looking through them) is astounding. The Nikon pair is far superior in every way (except compactness). Perhaps I should have gone for a pair somewhere in between these two size extremes. But I'm willing to put up with the size difference to achieve this huge superiority in quality and comfort.Returning the Olympus product today."
4,Good at a reasonable cost,"These are very good for the money. They do not produce an extremely bright image compared to more expensive binocs, but they are better then the uber-cheap models ($13-$15) you can buy. The carrying cord is oddly arranged, but they are very light weight. If you are already hauling around a spotting scope and want a pair of binocs for on-the-fly viewing, these are quite acceptable. They would also work well in your carry-on if you are combining birding and business."
4,Olympus Outback 8X21 RC1 Binoculars,"When I first open the package, I liked these binoculars. They are small, fit well in my husbands pants pocket. Inexpensive for a nice product. It took a little longer for the shipping than expected."
4,Nice size; good deal.,"I bought these binoculars after reading reviews here and in Consumer Reports. I took them on a recent trip and they provided good views of Yosemite National Park's features and its residents. When you don't have much packing space but don't want to miss the details of distant vistas this model is a good choice. Of course, it's nice if one person ""owns"" the binoculars, so the focus doesn't have to be changed between users!"
4,Quality small binoculars,Very pleased with the optical quality of these small binoculars. I wish that they had put the focus wheel at the far end of the bino's instead of right next to your eyes.
3,Useful book,"Used it for a Modern American History paper, along with several other sources. Pretty much what you already know about the whole system, only in print."

5,"Astounding, Fantastic, Inspiring, Intelligent Music","It was my drum teacher who mentioned DISCUS to me, suggesting that I listen to it since it is one of the very few Indonesian progressive rock bands. So naturally when I finally discovered it in a local music store, I listened to it a number of times. I found myself drawn to the odd beats and the dynamic melodies. I love all of the tracks, my favorite being ""Anne"" for its haunting lyrics and melodies. Try DISCUS... you will find it worth your time!"
4,controlled chaos,"Wow! You've got to have an open mind for this cd! Return to Forever meets Frank Zappa meets Rob Zombie meets Egg, and it's all on steroids. This is one of the most intense albums of music I have ever heard. The musicianship is great, the production is great (although the overall sound gets a bit clustered at times) and the writing is off the wall. The only weak spot is, perhaps, that the segues are very abrupt. If you like your prog extremely complex and challenging, this one will interest you. Push play and hang on!"
3,Fast reference book at best,"I bought the book for research about James Buchanan, being gay. This area was not in the chapter. But the book was well researched and a fun read when I travel and have nothing to do."
1,Inaccuracies Mar This Book,"I was looking forward to reading this book -- and then found several mistakes in it. I'll give one example. On page 159 Servadio states that the King of France died in 1536 and his son Henri became king. What actally happened was the Dauphin of France, Henri's older brother, died that year, and under suspicious circumstances, too. Some suspected that Henri and his infamous (an unjustly maligned) wife Catherine de Medici persuaded an Italian to poison the unfortunate Dauphin, since the couple now stood first in line for the throne. (They didn't.) Henri's father took his first son's death hard, and the strain in the royal family affected the Court and the country for the remaining 9 years of Francois I's reign. None of which Servadio covers in her gloss of history. The date of King Francois' death is well known and the author's ignorance here is irritating because it casts doubt on all the assertions in the book."
5,Geniue.. pure genius.,"Neil Hamburger is a genius. Pure and simple. His task is to become the worst stand-up comedian in the world.. and he fails horribly. This guy's awesome, and this DVD will be the best 20 bucks you have ever spent in your life. Think Andrew Dice Clay mixed with Bob Saget mixed with Tony Clifton."
4,Enlightening and helpful...,This is a better than the average christian guide. The author does a great job combining old testament stories with modern day situations.
