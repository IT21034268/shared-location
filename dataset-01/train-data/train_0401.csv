1,big disappointment,"the ipod mini can only be charged by plugging it into the usb port of a computer. this takes 4 hours. this means the computer must be on all that time and without a computer, the ipod mini cannot be charged. so how to travel? I feel this is big terrible mistake of apple not to supply a better way of charging the battery, which only lasts 6 hours not 12 as they advertise. Also, the controls don't really work that smoothy especially the volume control. I do not recommend to buy this product until apple rectifies this problem"
1,Such a rip off,"I don't like iPod's. I think that they're a total rip off. You buy an iPod for like $200.00, then you have to buy your charger, then you have to buy your headphones. Plus you have to pay for the songs you download on it. Thats what blew me away. I think that since you payed about $300.00 for your iPod, they should atleast give you the songs for free. I would advise everyone to stay away from them if they want to save money..."
2,The price is rising,"last time I checked you could get an ipod for $180. i last checked about 2 weeks ago and i thought it was a rip off then. this is outrageous, apple makes their ipods for $30 and amazon is selling them for $200. they're earning more money than they need, yet people still keep buying them. Sure it's great with all the songs, games and features but, it's not worth the money your paying for it. IT'S A RIP OFF."
1,Duped,I am dismayed after buying this from amazon. They have promised ear bud headphones but have provided the dated common headphones.
2,"Okay, I guess.","My uncle has one of these, and it has LITERALLY a million scratched. The screen looks primitive and unlike the usually technologically up-to-date stuff that Apple makes.The screen doesn't light up, and the Hold button get stuck.He almost bought me a mini, as a gift, but surprised me with a nano, and I'm glad he did. The mini is a defective little gadget with many flaws.(I'd rather have a shuffle with no screen.)"
4,its good,i got this for christmas last year. i like the color of it but i wish the screen was color too. i was great untill a couple days ago. The battery icon would pause half battery so i woudnt know when it would run out. And it would only play my cds i put on it till i charged it again. Even though some nanos are having trouble two of my friend have them and i like theirs alot better even if its more expensive.
5,Love it!,"I just got my iPod Mini, and I LOVE IT!!!!! It's awesome. It's definitely worth the $200. The only thing I wish it had was a better charger you could use in the car. Apple sells one, but it has terrible feedback. One of the best features: you can play games while you listen to music. There's 4 games: Brick, Music Quiz, Parachute, and Solitaire. Music Quiz is the only one you CAN'T play while listening. This is a must buy!"
3,Too small,Well I got a Ipod and love it at first. It was small and a lot better then a cd play. You don't worry about you cd getting mess up or lost. The software is easy to use to. The wheel take some time to get used to but not too long. So It is good but the things that I don't like about it is 4 gb was good at frist but I wanted to put a cd on and not take it off. with the 4 GB you can not do that. The screen is in black and white and most MP3 players screen are in color so you are not getting the most for you money. This is more for kids to have you can't do much but listen to music on it. Other MP3 players you can have photos and have real setting. If you are looking somethings better then a cd player then this is you but if your looking to put a lot of songs on then you need to go bigger.
5,Works like a charm,"This is the first upgrade from my first gen iPod (15G) and I love it. Easier to carry around, responsive UI, adequate information displayed, and my 7 year old loves it (he will inherent a tech love)."
5,Beautiful landscapes from Superior Home Video,This is a great video! Learn to take fantastic shots of beautiful landscapes in this 30 minute video. superiorvideo.com
1,"Useless, bure kabisa!","Utterly useless, bure kabisa! Better to purchase the original releases of the tracks rather than listen to these live performance versions and their attendant interferences. I regret purchasing this CD. I would have promptly returned it had I not already opened it!"
2,For display only,These cups are not for actual use. They are too small and can only be used for display.
5,Best shoes (or atleast one of) of all time!!!!!,This shoes are great in every single way and you can run practically light speed with them!!!!!Great shoes from Adidas!
3,Dolores?,"A short review: hated the first third, liked the middle third, lukewarmed the last third. All and all an interesting, though unfocused, quickread. However, methinks Magic Realism is moribund, if this book is any indication. It tries so hard.... Yet it does have its moments, humour, insight.... Lovely ending, too (not!)"
1,got sucked in by the cover,"the articles of this man's defense, what should have been the most important part of the book, were NUMEROUS, DRAWN-OUT, and EXTREMELY DRY.i liked the cover. liked the VERY ending too. its the in-between bits that i wasn't crazy about."
3,Beautifully written novel,It is hard to believe this wonderful book about a heart broken man is a translation. What Renaldo does for love and his discovery are equally fascinating.
2,Anatomist Fails To Excite!,The front cover would like to lead you to believe that this is a controversial novel. If the search for something different and challenging has pointed you in the direction of this book then you will almost certainly be disappointed. It's about as controversial as a wet fish! There are some good moments within the novel especially towards the conclusion of the book but the actual ending definately does not enter this category. The strange short chapter style of the book breaks up the general flow of the work to too great an extent.
3,Trenchant criticism of male-oriented medicine.,"The obvious parallel in this novella is between the anatomist Mateo Columbo, and the explorer Christoforo Columbo. Each may have expanded the universe of knowledge of their time, but did so for personal gain as much as any devotion to a Quest for Truth. The anatomist's search for the means to control women through their ""passion"" is also a means to impose his passion upon the unobtainable great puttana Mona Sofia. This reviewer sees an additional parallel suugested by the fact that the author is a psychiatrist."
2,What a pretentious aping of Umberto Eco! A waste of time.,"Despite several well crafted passages, Andahazi has spilled an overblown, puffed up imitation of contemporary European fiction in his first novel. Like so much in his native Argentina's culture, the author, failing to find his own voice, has aped the Continental greats. This is simply a foolish imitation of The Name Of The Rose, lacking both subtlety and sophistication. Far from being a novel of ideas, or even erotic fiction, this would be parable is so stuffed with postmodern platitudes and poor characerization that it collapses from the dead weight inane contradiction. Here is a hint, if a dust jacket reads, ""In the tradtion of.....,"" skip the imitation and read the original."
2,Great Story - Shame about the book,"This is an interesting historical tale. What I found most interesting was the author's historical research. It is difficult at times to distinguish fact from fiction, and although this may have been a desired effect, it is frustrating at times if you actually want to know what really happened. All in all, the story and characters are potentially fascinating - but only potentially. A great opportunity was missed here. All the ingredients are certainly there to produce a major epic instead of this slender tome. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth reading."
4,The Inside Scoop,This book may suffer a little in translation but I enjoyed it! It is interesting to read about the growing knowledge of human sexuality during the Renaissance especially about the brave and curious who dared probe what the Church forbade. The book has given me a new appreciation for female genitalia and the ultimate power of women's sexuality over men.
4,"A skillful tale of love, sex, science and religion in the 16th Century","This novel is nicely done--deserving of more credit than many reviewers here have given it. It is in part a love story, in part an exploration of sexual repression and religious intolerance of science, in part a comic look at how men have historically been mystified by the female body (and, for that matter, by women). The linkage of clitoral stimulation to witchcraft seemed plausible to me as a 16th century viewpoint, and in any event was quite funny. In addition to all that, the woman who read it after I finished it thought it was tastefully erotic. This is a skillfully told tale; I'm surprised it doesn't have a wider audience."
3,Neither Fish nor Fowl,"I much enjoyed the book and read it at one sitting. As others have noted, the author is clearly familiar with the subject, and has done plenty of research, and has peppered the text with enough Italian phrases to make you almost feel at home in the plot. Written in a style that aspires to be literary, philosophical, as well as befitting the period, the novel fails to move the reader and feel for the characters who are as flat as a board. Five for research and style and one for writing a compelling as well as historically founded plot. There you go, a plain three stars!"
2,get a filter for your mouth,"Such inspiring deeds. In so many places I was truly inspired by his navigation of difficult situations as well as his discipline. If he had been as disciplined in refraining from his need to dis others and employed the filter for mouth with as much stealth as his climbing gear, I would've given this book 4 stars. But I was so put off by his inappropriate comments about Chantel. Talking about his one night stand with a girl ""everybody liked "" even though she wanted to keep it ""hush hush ""felt a little like a high school boy bragging in the locker room, caring less that it's not just his story to tell and may not be public. I kept reading, but this kind of narcissism kept coming through loud and clear. If you really look up to this guy, don't read the book - it might change your perspective."
5,Climb Your Personal Mountain,"Even if you never climb any mountain, this true story will inspire you to beat whatever personal goal you've set for yourself."
1,A real disappointment,"This is a very self centered account. I got tired of hearing how great Ed Viesturs was and then I got really tired of all of the quotations from other sources about how great Ed was. I didn't get much insight into mountaineering or climbing philosophy. Somewhat of a shill for his commercial sponsor. Every time he mentioned leaving his tent, he had to name the make and model - repeatedly."
2,"mountains, not mommy","mountaineering books and videos are purchased to hear and see about the climbs, with views and techniques discussed. not to hear about viestur's mommy worries while he traipses all over the world. yeah, yeah, he's careful because he loves his wife and family. yeah, yeah, he worries about them while he is gone. but he still goes. and still makes a business out of danger, not his veterinarian diploma. this guy has spent most of his young life in one of the most selfish pursuits on the planet, and i suspect had a great time doing so. now he tells us that the whole time he was eaten up with regard for his family?"
4,different viewpoint,Well written not to interested in his adventures othet than on the mountain. Gives a very different viewpoint of the men who climb the highest mountains
5,Great story with interesting behind-the-scenes details,"This is a fascinating story of an amazing quest. Besides the usual climbing heroics, close calls, and tragedies, I found the personal story of Viesturs' evolution wonderful. The story is very well told and we have Roberts to thank for that.Even if you aren't that into mountaineering, you will love this book."
4,Solid Read with Straightforward Insights,"If you are interested in big mountain climbing (armchair or otherwise), this book will give you a peek into the life of one mountaineer. Ed talks about ""acceptable risk"", physical sacrifices, finanical sacrifieces, practicalities of climbing. This is not a ""Into Thin Air"" drama, but rather a solid account of one man's journey."
5,doesn't get much better,"Recently a high schooh friend from central New York shared slides of his adventure to climb the Seven Summits. I had to know more - what motivates a person to this advernture?No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaksanswered this question and more-what it feels like to be [vicariously] on the mountain with the climber. I could not put the book down, and now also view climbing pictures from the the many web sites that give one the visual-its awesome.Dick Mayberry, McLean Virginia"
3,Looking for more,"Ed draws you in for the first 40 pages about his 90's K-2 climb. Couldn't put the book down. Ed also writes a lot about his Everest climbs and his trials of getting Annapurna under his belt. The other eleven 8000m mountains? Ed does write about them, but I was wishing more detail on those peaks. I wasn't interested in Ed's wife & kids or Ed figuring out sponsorship, so I usually skipped those sections. The book needed more pictures of the other, lesser known mountains. Could have made room for more summit pics if he cut down the three shots of his wife and kids to just the family picture. Yeah, I know, family is important, but I bought the book to learn what it was like to hit all the big mountains and each one's particular obstacles. Still a good read."
4,No Shortcuts To The Top- Real Words for Life,"This is a fantastic publication about Ed Viesturs' amazing accomplishments in mountaineering. I always enjoy reading stories of the truly successful to learn what I can do to push myself, and to become more. That is what you can really find from this story- another instance that nothing gets accomplished with mediocrity, and if you want to get to the top, there is no shortcut- it requires planning, dedication, persistence, and pushing through the pain. There is some language to work around, which might be a deal-breaker for some. However, this is Ed's story told in his own words, which is as authentic as you can get. It is a great way to develop an understanding of what it takes to do something great with your life."
4,Good Book,I enjoyed the book a lot. I only gave it 4 stars because it starts to ramble a little bit towards the end about his family life which is ok but it doesn't compare to adventuring in the mountains. Its an easy read and there are many sections that you cant stop reading.
3,ed viesters thinks a lot of himself.,"i liked the book for it's info on mountain climbing. but, it's only 3 stars because of viesters. this is the first book about ed viesters that i've read......and it'll be the last. i was planning on buying his book about climbing annapurna, but i'm not getting it now. viesters spends too much time talking about how wonderful/skillfull he is at seemingly everything.in this book, he comes off as very narcissistic and that really bugged me.too bad - there is a lot of interesting info in it that's ruined by viesters ""self-love""."
3,"Great stories, terrible writing",I loved hearing Ed describe his climbs and how he progressed from going to school to be a vet to becoming America's most accomplished mountaineer. Interesting stories of his big climbs and the challenges he faced. But the writing it just terrible. It reads like the book was just dictated. At some points this gets a bit painful and hard to read. But otherwise enjoyable.
3,"Clear, excellent example of bias","I love this book. I teach a class that includes a component on critical thinking, and I've had trouble finding clear examples of authors who are able to all of the following in one argument: (a) use bias in choosing the facts they present, (b) mischaracterize the meanings of these facts, (c) mischaracterize counter arguments, AND (d) reason incorrectly about what their already selective premises. But now I've found plenty of examples here.If you want a terrific list of examples of appalling reasoning, get this book! It is the ultimate resource."
1,Sounds intresting but isnt,"I thought it would be interesting but upon reading it i realized that it was too much like his 20/20 stuff, Stossel comes off like a knowitall jerk. He is right and everyone is wrong. I tried to give it a chance but sometime the evidence seem alittle questionable...or rather opinions were facts.The book felt like i was reading an internet blog making the facts fit a particular world view.I really tried to give it chance...it sucked. Stossel comes off like a jerk.PS i thought it was funny that amazon is trying to sell this as a special offer with anne coulters boook......i guess amazon knows something i dont. don't waste money either."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"If I could choose no stars, I would.This book is an insult to the intelligence of all.It is full of misinformation and nonsense. I had to wonder who is paying John Stossel to write the garbage contained within."
1,I'm CONSERVATIVE and I DISAPPROVE of this book.,A rich fat cat writing a messed up book about everything being wrong but doesn't expect us to fix the problem. His bs shows that he has no understanding or respect for an orthodox household ! I'd rather dump some goose poo on this book rather than waste time digging dirt with a shovel with no end in sight. An earlier reviewer correctly noted that the book's too pooped that no animal even bother laying its mess on it ! I seriously doubt Stossel himself even bothered reading his own trash such as this book or he would have SUPER-pooped in his pants already !
4,A Bracing Dose of Skepticism and Libertarian Thinking,"Do you want to introduce a young person to skepticism and libertarian thinking? Give them this book! Each chapter is a series of articles debunking or confirming ""myths"", loosely grouped by topic. Does the full moon increase crime rates? Does astrology work? Do education vouchers harm public education? The articles are short(~2 pages) and easy to read. Some of the topics need longer treatment, but this is a great start. End notes back up some, but not all of the assertions of the text."
4,myth buster,John has an easygoing style which is easy to read. Very informative and disturbing food for thought.
5,Incredible,This book is quite incredible. John Stossels explores hundreds of interesting myths and reveals the truth. He explains all of his answer and provides reasons and sources for all of them. This is simply an incredibly informative book!
5,Excellent Read - A Real Eye Opener,Great book by a fantastic reporter. This is a great primer for every red-blooded American who cares about his country and the people that live in it.
4,How to stay 'informed',"Mr Stossel accomplishes what very few authors are able to do; discuss issues succinctly, provide references, and have the reader reach decisions on their own. As opposed to so many current authors, Mr Stossel is no spin doctor!I personally don't agree with all of his conclusions; fine, but it is still a great read."
4,A good read,"If I hadn't read his first book, this would be a 5 star review. I give it a four only because it repeats a lot of examples in his first. Still, an excellent look at everyday items we all have read in the media and why we shouldn't take them at face value."
4,The shovel of Stossel,It's a summary of different programs of 20/20. They're programs with good articulation and they are made since a conservative point of view. But the critics to State actions and to some popular fashions as Chiropractics and horoscopes is hilarious. I enjoyed the book and recommended to everybody who likes the well-elaborated critics to State actions and other issues
3,"This book has its charms, and its flaws.",When I heard that John Stossel had come out with a book I figured that it would inevitably be a good one. Boy was I really wrong. The idea that he goes around breaking down myths is awesome. His problem is that he decides to waddle his way in to politics. That's where the bleeding begins. It finally releases when he tries to convert the reader in to a libertarian. Which is a shame becuase it was well on its way to 4-5 stars.
4,"Myths,lies,and downright stupidity",Great book full of information a must read if you are looking for a different point of view. Will open your eyes to seeing things differently
5,"great book, enlightening","great book, enlightening with clear facts and examples to show you how dumb the majority of people can be. As an American, it's sad that so many citizens are so oblivious to what really goes on in this country."
5,Great book!!!,John Stossel does it again with another great book.Don't believe everything you hear on mainstreammedia.
1,Propaganda,"I don't know anything about Stossel. The book looked intriguing.But I got so angry reading this book, I threw it out 1/4 of the way through it--recycled it--rather than inflict it on any one else.I've read hundreds of informational fact/trivia books like this, so when I say this was full of misinformation, I know whereof I speak.But worse, it was infused throughout, covertly, with right wing propaganda. Is Stossel a right wing bonkjob? That's my take away from this book.Unless you like to be fed lies, pap and ideology, stay away from this one."
1,Very poor and incoherent writing and thoughts. Doesn't make any sense.,"The book just lists a bunch of problems and wierd thingies but even clowns get serious once in a while. The kind of writings Stossel dumps forth would have gotten anyone else an F minus minus minus. I guess it only takes clout and money to elevate a really poor quality talker and book to top status. Why Amazon and ABC even give these good-for-nothings a free space is beyond me. With all the poop filled in this book, Stossel is messier than the messiest barnyard animals !"
1,Too partisan and has no respect for moderates,"Once when he was asked on ABC who he thinks is the lesser of the two evils, Al Quaida or liberals, Stossel had this to say ""I'd rather see Al Quaida blowing out liberals than liberals taking my money away and giving it to poor and lazy people !"" His book is pretty much more of the same advocating that America stay the course of socializing poverty and terrorism and running the country into the ground. I must also say that even a lot of conservatives will not like his book when you look at his social flaws on things like polygamy and prostitutes. I can see Stossel tripping on his face when Bernard Sanders, unafraid to call himself a good socialist, joins the fight to tear down the rightwing taliban currently in power."
4,Setting the record straight,"This book explores, and explodes, many of the ""urban myths"" that abound in our culture. It also reveals that many of the things that we believe are true are not, and the reverse. Each segment is rather short, and capable of being read very quickly. I found it quite interesting, and learned (or unlearned) many things I had believed, or not."
3,OK--Needs larger print,"Stoessel writes as well as he reports on TV...entertaining. The content is pertinent and though provoking to what the population is feeling an yet, doesn't know for sure. Hard to read with the small print."
3,"Interesting perspective, but lacking a common thread","The book has many interesting segments, but it doesn't seem to transition between them smoothly enough to keep me reading."
1,Lies & the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"Once again Stossel is trying to peddle the assertion that raising the minimum wage will hurt the economy, when in fact fair and balanced studies show exactly the opposite.Stossel is a professional liar who uses his position at ABC News, as well as the right-wing PR machine, to promote the neocon agenda. Any claims of ""objectivity"" can be put to rest by the fact he gets awards from right-wing groups, and is given a platform at fringe right-wing corporate-funded groups like the Cato Institute and Townhall.com. The Bill O'Reilly endorsement says it all.Sad, but unfortunately not all that shocking, that he is still employed by a major media company. Don't waste your money on this claptrap."
1,"If you're not sure about things, John will tell you what to think!","John Stossel is unhappy. He's unhappy with the way things are in America. Things ought to be better in America so John decied to write a book that contains a bunch of things that John wants you to know. I can summarize the book so you won't have to spend your hard earned money reading it. The market is always right. Government is always wrong. People should be free to do what they want. Rich people are good because they're obviously better than poor people. People shouldn't be so dumb. If people weren't so dumb, John and the hair over his lip wouldn't have to stage cute photographs for covers of books that are written to explain why John is so smart and so many people are so dumb. Did I mention that all government rules and regulations are bad...very, very bad and that the market is good...just like John? John is smart. He's very, very smart and he owns a shovel."
4,Eyeopener,"I consider myself to be skeptical and analytical, but John Stossel opened my eyes to many beliefs I held that were erroneous. Thank you Mr Stossel for showing me that common sense has not died in the U.S. just yet.Your ability to get behind the images to the truth is awesome."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm sorry I bought this book. While Mr. Stossel got a few things right and some of it was interesting, he and his ""researchers"" didn't do a very good job. It would have been great if they had actually done some independent research on some of those subjects instead of listening to so-called ""experts"". This book simply furthers their agendas by spreading conclusions, many of which are themselves, ""myths, lies and downright stupidity""."
4,Can't Go Wrong With John Stossel,"Shorter than the normal books on CD at just 3 hrs, this is a great listen during that length of a drive."
5,Stossel review,I loved this book and also his last one.I like the way he attacks ignorance and hipocrasy.May he continue the good work.
4,Are you a thinker? Do you want to be challenged?,"The great thing about this book is that it challenges a lot of ideas we assume to be true. Some of his arguments may convince you and some of them won't. However, if you are a thinker, you will enjoy this challenge and enjoy engaging in these questions. Get past whether this is a conservative or liberal book--that's not the point."
4,"Energy, Edge,& Opinions","John writes a rousing romp through a landscape of cherished assumptions. Not for the faint of humor - John's commentaries and analyses run the gamut from thorough, grounded research to pure ""shock value"" opinions. John succeeds in illuminating and entertaining us, although sometimes at the expense of fueling his edgy commercial sensationalism. Through it all I believe he is sincere, focused and determined to help us overcome our insidious afflictions to the rampant and constant hype of hooky truisms so many of us swallow hook, line, and sinker. This deserves a read just accept John's style and be sure to read between the lines to debunk your own myths."
1,"Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity","A real disappointment. I ordered eight copies for gifts and after reading the book I would be ashamed to give them to friends. Some parts are indeed myths, Lies, and downright stupidity but much of it is Stossel's opinion. I suppose if you are totally money oriented and believe everyone else is too then Stossel's spin might sound factual to you. I have eight copies to return."
1,Why John Stossel doesn't understand science...,"John Stossel has a way of presenting a story that can be captivating... unfortunately, he often selects only the information that supports his claims instead of really examining the subject in a scientific manner. Perhaps John Stossel doesn't understand the scientific method and therefore is in capable of using this type of method to truly act like an investigative journalist - that is why he likes sensationalism..."
1,"Dude, where's my facts?","If you like pat, absolute assertions as to what is right or wrong in America based entirely on random, anecdotal opinion, then you'll love this book.Mr. Stossel knows that a minimum wage is bad. Why? Because he analyzed macroeconomic data on wages, unemployment, and consumer trends? No. He knows that a minimum wage is bad because a couple of guys who run pizza joints told him so.There. You see? It's just intuitive; government is bad, those with wealth and power should always be allowed to do just exactly as they please to the planet and its people."
2,Blasphemous,"The author makes makes skewed, extreme, and often ridiculous statements in a desperate attempt to try to stretch-out an entire book out of a handful of decent statements. If someone's going to tell me that I ""everything I know is wrong"", I expect there to be scientific proof presented in a professional manner. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a TV news anchor puts flashy words on a book with little substance. Heck he got me to buy it. I'm writing this so that other people don't waste the $15 on it, too.For example, he tries to convince the public that the price of gas is actually cheap compared to everything else. He compares it to the price of bottled water. I don't DRINK gasoline, and I'd be pissed if the water-supply companies formed a conglomerate and restricted the supply of my water while their profits soared. He also compared it to the price of ice cream. Same idea, I don't EAT frozen gasoline."
2,Stossel Lives in the Corporate Pocket,"Stossel repeatedly dismisses environmental problems and concerns and after a while it is evident that he is biased against science and facts and is in the pocket of the corporate polluters and developers. Nice try, Stossel."
3,Just alright,His writing style is nothing to write home about and the book is a little droll. It's breezy enough of a read though.
1,catalog of right wing fantasys.,"Stossel's ""debunkings"" consist of selectively biased analyis and willful ignorance of social context... Typical of the simplistic thinking of those social engineers passing for ""libertarians"" these days. True, Stossel may not be a self avowed neocon, but his work advances thier repressive big government/big business agenda even as he falsely positions himself as and advocate for the individual. Truly a ""useful idiot"" to the neo-Stalins running America these days...The only question is... does he know this himself, or is he as big a dupe as his audience?"
2,"Second Verse, Same as the First","John Stossel has, again, come out with a book that is simplistic in many aspects; both the writing and the arguments. If you enjoy television type sound bites and simplistic reading and logic, by all means buy the book. If, however, you enjoy logical arguments, or good writing, stay away from this book.In addition to sloppy arguments, he again falls into the trap that he did in his first book. He quotes sources, but he condenses quotes and doesn't give attribution to his sources. That pretty well guarantees that you won't be able to see where he got his quotes, and in which context he got them.He makes some good arguments and some terrible ones. His problem seems to be that he thinks he is a libertarian, when in fact, I don't think he knows exactly what he believes in. He does have an agenda, which seems to be against government and lawyers and very pro business (as well as pro John Stossel)."
1,idiotic,"His recent article on the environment is super rightwing biased. His conclusions (people who want government jobs are invariably evil) are just not supported and can be immediately turned around against the things he supports.He chooses one wacky, edge-case example and elevates it, acting like it's the rule.This gimmicky line of thinking is only interesting if you're one of those people who like to believe ""everything we know is wrong, so we might as well just give up."""
1,A spoiled rich brat trying to play victim !,"If you know Stossel, you pretty much know his book. Who needs a shovel when the dirt in Stossel already shows ?!? The only thing this book is useful for is a nice source of heating fuel in the winter time. That should save a buck or two even as the price of gas keeps going up !"
1,Stossel needs to shut up,"It's outrageous that this liar argues for a low minimum wage (already at a 50-year low) while raking in truckloads of money for this book that's 100% crap. This book is a waste of trees, and Stossel is a waste of carbon."
1,"What do Stossel, O'Reilly and TBN have in common?","Lies, half truths, spin and glitz. Of course there is some truth sprinkled in. Self promoting TV stars are more interested in being self promoting TV stars than truth. Theres just not enough time for both. At best it's entertainment, at worst it misleads the children. And finally they are all biblically illiterate. So be careful...especially with TBN."
3,Never the twain shall meet...,"After having read the book and all the reviews, I have come to one conclusion: when the Left does not like the message, they attack the messenger; when the Right does not like the message, they attack the message.This phenomenon is not restricted just to John Stossel's book. It glares in the reviews for the Ilario Pantano book, ""Warlord: No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy"". And it was so extreme regarding the book, ""Samson Blinded"" that Amazon had to remove all the initial reviews.It seems to me that reviews should address the content of a book, not the veracity or intent of the author."
4,Get out the shovel is right!,"Myths, Lies, and Down Right Stupidity was a good book to read to help you see what is happening right in front of your nose. I love watching John Stossel on 20/20, he usually hits the nail square on the head. This book dose just that while helping you see the stupidity of government and people in general. The one thing I hope is that people will read this book and educate themselves on the racketeer running unions that rule politics like the Iron Curtin did, the pitiful state of our education system, the bigger government gets the smaller our freedoms get. Wake up America! Stop being so apathetic!"
4,Very Informative Book,I heard the author of this book on a radio talk show and found what he said fascinating. This book has been refreshing as it reveals to us that we are being duped into believing lies perpetrated by the liberal mindset.I recommend this book to those who want to know the truth behind what we read in the newspapers and see on television.
5,It seems that one person is writing numerous one-star reviews,"If you look at the one-star reviews below, it seems that many of them come from the same person. They are trying to drive down the rating for the book. If you look at the one-star reviews, there is nothing to suggest that the reviewer even read the book - because they almost certainly have not. They seem more like temper tantrums than serious reviews.I bought the book after work on Friday, and finished it this afternoon. Stossel is certainly not conservative. He is his usual libertarian self. Because you don't hear these views from anyone else in the news media, the book is very refreshing and thought-provoking. The book is hard to put down and a great read."
5,Overall a great book,"As if often the case with books like this one, people usually fall on one side or the other of the kinds of topics faced by books like this one. If you find that you generally agree with Stossel's conclusions in his 20/20 specials, etc. then you will probably appreciate this book. If you already disagree with him, then you likely won't.Personally, while discretion and discernment is required for everything you read or watch, I think he hits a lot of nails on the head - but I'm one of those people who believes in personal responsibility, liberty and small government. : )"
4,"This is ""An Oldie, but Goodie""","This is one of those things they dont teach you in school. It is an excellent guide for someone who seeks personal success.It contains valuable lessons presented in simple and plain english. It is a light read and straight to the point. It is also an interesting read because it will make you pause and think twice and will make you reflect on certain points in life.This is not your new age personal development program that's filled with promises. This book is not an inspirational book... it is a personal development book. It is not hyped up with creating you a glamorous future, but it is more like a blueprint for self growth, self development and self improvement that can help you to build a desirable future.This is a great book to add to your library collections. It is ""an Oldie, but Goodie"""
1,Not what I thought it was,"Do not make the mistake of thinking this book is related to Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East (6 Volume Set) by Baird T. Spalding. Robert Collier has nothing to do (evidently) with the true Ascended Masters, and the book is basically a motivational positive thinking type book. I was very disappointed in this book."
5,Will the fight for Freedom cost Daniel his life?,"This story starts out with Roxanne and Daniel being reunited outside of Concord. But, before long Daniel is left for dead and Roxanne is captured by the British. But, will the 2 ever find each other again and will they be able to continue their fright for Liberty?Also is posing as a Tory going to be the death of Elliot Markham? Will he be condemned even though he is a Patriot at hear?The author takes you back in time to live the history being made by the young people of the American Colonies. You will feel their hardships and still want to know what is going to happen next.I highly recommend this series to all!"
5,"Beware the thieves and bandits, this book is in print!!!","Don't pay up to $180.00 for this book!!! It is available directly from the publishers, and is still in print at:http://www.capallbann.co.ukIt's not ""cheap"" there, but it's a LOT cheaper than what these so-called ""secondary market"" sellers will cheat you out of for a copy!!!Be a Seeker, NOT a Sucker!!!"
5,Swaying:Essays on Intercultural Love,"I am so happy I found this book. If you are in an intercultural relationship, these are a wonderful compilation of stories from others who are going through or have gone through similar situations. I was laughing out loud at situations so similar to my own. It is a wide range of people and situations and just a joy to read. There defiantely aren't a lot of books on the subject, and this is a great addition to my library!"
4,"A must read, even in 2005/2006+","Covers XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), SQL Injection hacks, and a bunch more!PROS: Doesn't get deep into code, but shows all the ways that people will peek and poke in your web apps. Covers IIS, Apache, ASP, PHP, CGI, and some CMS systems I've never heard about but Enterprise level teams may use.CON: The book is probably due for a second edition, only because it's a couple years old - but all info/issues/hacks are still issues today!"
3,Don't get this if you need the newest edition!,"This is a good book for English Comp 1, but don't get it if you need the newest edition. I asked the seller for a list of all the writings in the book, and the list they gave me was not accurate at all. I don't have half the writings I need this semester. But the book does explain writing quite well."
5,Recommendable Movie,"This melancholy film is enjoyable and endearing. Although it deals with morbid themes such as suicide and death it skillfully adds humour and wit at appropriate times. I highly recommend this solid, funny film."
3,Very dark,"I have seen this listed under comedy, but the material is so dark and downbeat that even when comedy is intended, it is difficult to see the humor in the situation. Not only is it downbeat material wise, but even the cinematography follows suit. Much of the film is in surroundings such as an old dusty bookshop which is not well lit. I think it takes a special viewer to find the humor in this film, or even to be entertained by it."
3,Great pictures for the train buff,"This book is in B/W only. The only problem I have with it is that while the discriptions of each engine are complete, reference points listed above each item are not referenced. Being rather new to trains I found this lack of identification made this less then a truly worthwhile resource."
2,Not what I expected,"Too simplistic for my needs. Also I misunderstood, thinking there was help for interacting with toddlers, there really isn't, it's more grade school and up.If I had absolutely nothing else to do and wanted to dissect the information and adapt it to use with toddlers, there might be some information to glean.My advice to the author/publisher.... state what age group it is geared to."
1,A pact to avoid,"I had high hopes for this little book. I currently read about 100 books a year (and particularly enjoy mafia/underworld stories) but this one lacked...well...just about everything. The plot, though largely well-conceived, was interrupted incessantly with meaningless flashbacks. Otherwise powerful scenes became limp with annoying character daydreaming. Not only was there an abundance of typos (probably publisher's error) but the strange use of italics and punctuation frequently distracted this reader. And pacing was irregular: the novel's sense of ""time"" varied from paragraph to paragraph; the story bumped along. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was the writing itself. I found no voice in the book. Instead, choppy phrases and trite descriptions (""Mama's tired eyes lingered and drank the shared love her men demonstrated for one another"") left me searching for writing skills. So I wasted a little time. Big deal. I learn something every day."
4,A book work having!,I especially liked the timelines given for the recipes. The serving suggestions are great as well.
2,Not really what I wanted,"It's probably just that I was expecting to much,but I was hoping that there would be simpler methodsto animate, than I found in this book.What I actually wanted was something along the lineof a graphical user interface method/explanation foranimation."
5,This is GREAT stuff!,"This DVD is very cool. It's like learing all the mystical grooves that Vinnie plays. Gavin though is an incrediblke player, great technique, and killer grooves. His teaching is VERY clear and the material is fresh and exciting. A must have for all serious drummers!"
1,A major disappointment,"This book was over 50% information on current products, microprocessors and chipsets - Things I could have found using web searches. I really needed info on how to create win98 USB drivers - Maybe a little coding example. I read the entire book in 4 hours (including dinner) not what I would expect from a technical book."
2,More of a collection of vendor specs than a book.,"This book was a disappointment. As a USB developer, I was hoping for a good set of examples and actual applications of USB, both hardware and software. This book, however, is more of a collection of ""lightweight"" vendors specs and names and address of vendors with USB related products. If you are looking for sources for USB related parts, this book is useful. If you seek how-to examples for USB applications, this book offers little. I do not recommend this book because a web search turns up all the vendors listed in this book and more."
3,"smells like soap, not as good as others","This product has a soap smell, I sneezed. I was looking for something to replace the Windsor brand of Rose talc, but this isn't it! Acceptable but not great!"
3,Too MOR for me,"Definitely not his best. This collection of ten songs from 1970 is fair at best. Not one real memorable song. Instead, this is a collection of songs that would be heard to best advantage going up or down in an elevator.Program:""Inherit The Wind""""This Is The Story""""Stranger In My Own Home Town""""A Little Bit Of Green""""And The Grass Won't Pay No Mind""""Do You Know Who I Am?""""From A Jack To A King""""The Fair's Moving On""""You'll Think Of Me""""Without Love (There Is Nothing)"""
3,Feed the insanity.,"I had a fairly pleasant experience buying my first book for the computer kindle program; however, I really disliked the fact that the program did not display page numbers similar to the hard-copy of the novel. This made it rather difficult to keep up in class wile discussing the book in depth. The content of the book was decent as well."
2,CAUTION: Foul Language,"I was thumbing through this book before I gave it to my 12 year old daughter, and was shocked by the language. There is cursing on nearly every page. It is a shame, because the reviews for this book are great. I just didn't feel comfortable having my daughter exposed to the profanity."
1,Why did I finish this...,"The book starts out very interesting, and by the middle you're hooked. Sadly the rest of the book makes you wish you hadn't ever picked it up. The problem is you learn to love the characters, even with their flaws but they never get better. Their flaws actually get worse until the point that you hate them. I promise you that by the end you will hate the main character and hate the fact that your stuck a few pages from the end and have to waste your life finishing the story. If you can avoid this book."
1,My eyes!,"That was...awful. I regret paying. Lovely idea. However, main character had no emotion and wasimpossible to connect with. Horrid, predictable ending."
1,poor example of a book,This is the worst book I've (attempted) to read. I tried very hard to get past 2 chapters. The writing style does not flow and is very poorly written. I normally would not leave a review but the book is that bad! Not sure on what ratings and reviews an author would win a award as stated on the front cover but this book is best left for the shredder.
1,Dont waste your time!,"I was really excited to read this book based on all the wonderful reviews and the story line. I was extremely disappointed! It was a waste of my time! Throughout the entire book I couldn't even get attatched to the main character, because the author lacked in giving emotions to any of the characters. I am an avid reader and this is the only negative review I have ever given. This book was so bad I felt the need to warn others!"
1,stupid,"I understand what the author was trying to portray in this book. However, this is a serious waste of time. I felt dumber after reading this book. And nothing worthwhile even happened in this story! I was seriously disappointed after reading this entire book and if I could get that time back, I would in a heartbeat."
3,"After reading ""Feed"" I feel full.","Titus lives in a future time when a technology called ""the feed"" attaches right into your brain and gives him the ability to send email, chat, watch TV, order merchandise, and listen to the radio all at once. Everyone gets ""the feed"" installed when they're babies, and it helps them to know what's cool and where to shop for their favorite things.Everything in Titus' world is pretty normal until one spring break trip when he and his friends take a trip to the moon and meet Violet. Violet's not like the rest of them - she speaks differently, and she was home schooled so there are many things she's never done before. They end up going to a party, and that's when the unexpected happens... A hacker is at the party, and he infects 13 of the partygoers with a virus that messes up their ""feeds.""When you've lived your whole life with constant voices in your head, what do you do when it's suddenly all silent?"
3,It was OK....,"I bought this book after reading the first chapter and I really had high hopes for it. Although it was interesting, expecially the feed, I felt like it wasn't finished. I was turned off by the ending, not because of the ::obvious event::, but because nothing happened. She's gone, so what? It didn't show how he was changed or anything...Though I really disliked the ending, it was an interesting book. If you don't have a thing about endings, read it."
2,Feed,I bought this for my daughter....it was on her summer reading list. According to her the story was a good idea but it lacked a real comflict for the characters to resolve.
1,DON't buy it!,"this is one of the worst books ever..I only got through about half..not only are the ""feeds"" sooo annoying as the reader (and I understand why the author did them that way, but still, doing it thought out the whole book just got really annoying and i felt like they made no sense) but the story is also stupid (at least the first half that I barely got through)..this is one of those stories where kids rebel against ""the man"" ..very unlikely and these kids in real circumstances would have no chance of succeeding! it's like a 5 year old against the govt...or at least that's what it seems like..and the characters are sooo generic, and so uninteresting! very bad read! DON't buy it!"
2,"Original idea, poor execution","I applaud MT Anderson, the idea of the novel was very original and fascinating. The way he displayed the future was very thought provoking and disturbing. But, the characters, I thought, were SO shallow and annoying sometimes I couldn't stand it.Plus, the way in which the book was written was sometimes impossible to understand. The book drags along with seemingly no point, and the ending was predictable. If you read this book, prepare to be disapointed."
4,Strong theme but harsh language,"I used Feed in a high school English course. Be warned that this book has multiple curse words per page. The main character, Titus barely says anything without cursing. Also, the teens in the book have their own lingo. Students will need a list of the terms and what they mean to really understand the novel. Once you get past the cursing and lingo, the book is excellent and has multiple themes. Mixed in the story of the future changes on our Earth are themes of teen love and death. Great to teach universal themes and cultural archetypes."
3,Fascinating but bleak science fiction tale,"An interesting science fiction tale of life as a teenager with an Internet feed implanted and integrated into the brain. Details of the story set the time well into the future, at a point when government has apparently ceased to be relevant while all aspects of daily life are orchestrated by corporations that control the feed into everyone's brain. Very raw language and never-explicit but consistently off-handed references to casual sexuality and sensory abuse make this book better suited for older teens than for middle schoolers. It is also bleak in its lack of any suggestion for the possibility of redemption or improvement."
5,Great science fiction,"I must say, I'm not much for science fiction because the genre as a whole is very overworked...but this is a stunning novel which breathes new life into sci-fi.It follows Titus, an average teenager in a world where everyone is hooked up to the 'feed'; essentially a computer chip in your head that pretty much thinks and decides for you. It's a world filled with consumerism and sinister undertones, where advertisment has invaded everything and the feed is even used as a means to get high (through mal, short for malfunctioning)...At a party on the moon Titus, his friends and Violet are hacked, and Violet seems to have side-effects even after the hacking because her feed was implanted at a later age than recommended.A wonderful story with the originality that makes M.T. Anderson's books stand out. Although the language and slang can get a bit thick at times it is never uncomprehensible and added to rather than diminished the atmosphere of the book. Great read!"
4,Scenario is very thoughtful.,Thought Provoking...the scenario is very intriguing. But not much movement or direction. Maybe that's the point (not much direction in an existence like this). It is a warning / wake-up call for our first-world media- / SocialMedia- minded obsession with technology and entertainment. I can't say I enjoyed this book; but once again that may be the point.
1,Ugly Writing and Concept,Sometimes a good idea or set of ideas goes horribly wrong when written into being. Case in point - FEED. Was probably going for creative and unique ... ended up with annoying and slow. I'm sure there's a story in it with a plot and meaning ... but style and concept distracted me and gave me an overwhelming urge to go find something to read instead of fight with to get to the story.
2,Felt like he was trying to write 1984 and failed,"I think the author thought he was trying to write 1984 and failed. Yes, it portrays a bleak future dystopia, but I'm not sure it really hit the root of the problem."
4,interesting premise,"I really enjoyed this book when I read it high school. The premise of having live internet feeds installed in our heads seems very plausible to me the only thing I really had trouble with was the doctors in the book, I don't think specialized language will go away. It was a great read with weird random interesting details especially the origins of his friend ""Linc."""
2,Interesting premise not quite fulfilled.,"""Feed"" is full of fascinating ideas, but it's hampered by a less-than-compelling story and an arbitrary, unsatisfying ending. The key relationship -- a love story between two teenagers -- is unsupported. The story is set in a foreign time, but its characters are cliches. We've seen them in a hundred After School Specials. There's the beautiful, troubled outsider and her father, a quirky, suffering genius. There's also a set of self-absorbed, ineffectual parents straight out of Rebel Without A Cause. The points Anderson makes about consumerism are heavy-handed and too sparse for a work of this length. If the author had distilled ""Feed"" into a short story, it might well be a classic of both science fiction and the coming-of-age genre characterized by Catcher in the Rye."
5,great book i read in class,read this book in my English Honors class and loved it.We where able to learn alot about the Media Influence on society and read a story about a bit of romance and betrale
3,not crazy about the book,eh. it was alright... however the problem with this book is that the main character doesn't begin to feel real or show emotions untill the last few pages of the book. when its tough to care for a character or at least find somehting to identify with its tough to enjoy a book.
1,This book is like totally like meg bad Dude.,"Anderson took a bunch of teenaged idioTs that speak with like no Conviction? and set them in like the future? with like advertising chips in their like brains that are called feeds. You can like acess the internet and play games on them and listen to music and the feed will totally reccomend some thins that you should like totally buy based on your emotions meg cool right?Oh and like (explitive) (explitive) right and its like totally (explitive) null!!!!thats the book for you units and unettes.Translation: HOW THE HECK DID THIS BOOK WIN ANY AWARDS????!!!! ITS THE STUPIDEST POOR EXCUSE FOR A PIECE OF LITERATURE ON THE FACE OF THE ENTIRE PLANET!!!! YOUR IQ WILL DROP BY THE SECOND. DO NOT WASTE A DIME ON THIS BOOK, YOU'D BE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT!!!. i ACTUALLY HAD TO READ THIS CRUD FOR CLASS!!! arrrrrgghh!!!! DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,Chilling Satire,"Technologies like wireless networks and smart phones have made it possible to access media anytime, anywhere. In ""Feed,"" M.T. Anderson envisions a world where humans are continuously hooked up to an Internet-like stream of words, music, and images.Titus and his friends from School(tm) are having a brag spring break on the moon when a hacker causes their feeds to malfunction. Back on earth, Titus gets closer to Violet who suffered severe damage from the hack. For a while, Titus goes along with her as she attempts to resist the feed, but this eventually results in terminal feed failure.Though written for teens, adult readers will appreciate this chillingly believable satire of a future where corporations, consumerism, and mass media succeed in debasing humanity."
2,looking for the positive,"I get that this was a YA book, but the YA I have encountered don't speak this way! This alone made it difficult to get through. It made the future of our people seem pathetic and meaningless. No one can decide how to be unique without the ""Feed"". The older generation was able to remember some things of what it was like before, but they were the stupid ones. As I said, I get that this was a YA book, but if this is what our YA readers want and are able to relate to, we are in serious trouble and maybe M.T. Anderson is right on target!"
3,"Liberal, but intriguing","A very engaging tale, though unfortunately weaved together with a environmentalist message that didn't really fit the dystopia at all."
4,"If you like dystopic fiction, this is a great read","Starts simple and in fact a little vapid, but that's the point. The inherent evil of society is slowly revealed and is as horrifying as the premise of Hunger Games except that society is willingly participating in it's own opression. It reminds me of a really dark WALL-e (which was pretty dark if you think about it) where instant gratification blinds us to the reality of the Earth's demise. It's a world where trees are clear-cut to build ""air factories"" and the lesions people sustain b/c the ozone has been eaten away is turned into a fashion statement. There is no intellectual curiosity or free thought, but it's not because Big Brother forbids it. The characters are distracted by the next new thing and boredom is the ultimate evil. Next time you flip on ""Housewives,"" ""Kardashians,"" or ""Jersey Shore"" you may think about if a diet of reality tv is harmless or an opiate of the masses."
1,Could I be more bored?,The author is determined to write one cliche after another.The best I can say about this book is that it is boring.
3,Great refresher,"If you took French back in high school, and that's more years ago than you'd care to remember, this is a great little refresher book to get you reading and thinking in French again."
5,Fun French,"Very easy and readable stories in French that help you solidify the knowledge that you already have. This is definitely not the ""See Jane run"" variety of beginning reader but a cute series of adventures of a bunch of French teenagers told in a vocabulary that should suit the beginning student of French."
4,Great little reader,I am a learning French with a one on one teacher but I like to do some self-directed learning myself and I picked out this little book. It is a gem amd very good for a person just starting out to learn French. There are several very short stories and a few questions for review. Simple illustrations help you understand the language. The answer key is very handy if you are studying alone and not in a classroom. I would definitely recommend this book to a beginning Fench student - it is not for anyone with advanced skills.
4,"GENESIS, NO.... BANKABLE, YES!","The first time I played this I wasn't all that crazy about it, butafter the second time I listened to it, I started to notice that Iwas suddenly hearing the keyboard quality that I had so loved byTony when doing Genesis albums. Perhaps not for all Genesis fans,but anyone who likes beautiful melodies and, on this album, sweet vocals(even though Tony only sings on one song...)Of all of Tony Banks' solo works, I'd say this album is absolutelyhis best (I know some of you will disagree and say 'A Curious Feeling'is his best)... but I stand by this one."
2,Uninspired attempt to match bandmates' solo fame,"This was one more unsuccessful attempt by Tony Banks to match the solo success that Genesis bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford were achieving. This time around, Banks added a couple of singers and tried to call it a band. One of the singers is Jayney Klimek, formerly of the Other Ones (not the Grateful Dead Other Ones, the OTHER Other Ones, the ones who did ""We Are What We Are"" and ""Holiday""). The songs are drab middle-of-the-road efforts. Even the best songs, such as ""Big Man"", would be outtakes on any Genesis album."
3,Great.,Captain Howdy was a local band. I seen them come up through it all. Their influental styles of punk have changed many peoples lives. Don't be without this cd.
4,TexasSoundman,The drummer (besides Phil Collins) is Mike Clark. Mike Clark also played with Herbie Hancock & The Headhunters. Mike Clark and David Garibaldi (Tower of Power) are the two greatest funk drummers ever. This is a really good Brand X album.
2,Religious Book,This is a good book but I was looking more for a book with practical advice on specific issues. This book basically says that religion is the key overcoming all obstacles. I know that religion can overcome all obstacles but I knew that prior to reading the book.
2,"For adolescent daughters, not little girls","... and while it may be a quality item, it is definitely geared toward adolescents, not younger children. There was nothing that addressed the needs of dads for girls under the age of ten."
4,Trouble?,"My dad and I had problems ever since I started high school. Since I was the oldest of four kids, it was hard for him to accept the idea of me moving away...not only for college. During those years, he was very defensive and my adolecent attitude didn't help much.We always had a good bond and when we worked together, we kicked butt. This book has helped me get in touch with my dad more, and he is now starting to get over the fact that his kid isn't a kid anymore...It was good stuff."
3,cool but passing curiosity,"My eight year and older cousins lose interest after five or ten minutes. Pretty cool but too slow to really interact with.Maybe a five year old would have more sustained interest; I don't know.After three ten minute outings, our's will probably sit around until I find someone to pass it on to."
4,Great Pool and Tub Toy,"Our daughter wanted one desperately and we used it as a reward for one of her personal goals. The toy dispelled any concerns I'd had of her idealizing a toy that looked great but wasn't. She has enjoyed it so much that now she owns three of them. We brought it to her swim lessons and at the end of the class they all enjoyed chasing after it. I heartily recommend it for its playability, novelty and construction."
5,Rainbow Reef Fish,This is a great pool toy. Buy more than one. Batteries last about 24 hrs before replacing.
5,"GREAT, AWESOME, EXCITING FISH!!!!!!!!!","Hi I am 11 and I have a pool in my backyard and it was just a regular pool just to swim in and hardly do anything in it accept well..... just swim!!!! But then one day me, my mom, my dad, and my brother all went to toys r us for a intertube because the one that we had popped. And then the "" Rainbow Reef Fish"" cought my eye. Then I picked it up and asked my mom and dad if we could get it for the pool. They said yes we could but only if we payed for it with are own money which I happened to have my money with me in my pocket that day. So when we got home I got my bathing suit on and got the fish and I jumped right in the pool to play with it. I WAS SO EXCITED!!! This is a GREAT toy! And it is especially fun to go underwater with goggles and look at it swim from underneath the water. I highly reccomend this toy. And for the people who said that it stopped working. The just get a new one it could have been the fish. But it is worth the money."
2,Stopped working after the first day!,"I bought two of these fish as a special treat for my son, who had been begging for them. I read the directions carefully, making sure the battery compartment was sealed when I screwed it on. Both fish worked great for the first day, but wouldn't work again after. I put new batteries in and they still wouldn't work. It seems as though water got into the compartment, which is poorly designed and not leak-proof.So, I returned both fish to the store and bought the ""Finding Nemo: Disney Swimming Dory"" and ""Finding Nemo: Disney Swimming Nemo"" instead. I recommend them highly; the battery compartment is sealed and well-designed, the fish are very cute, and they swim even faster than the Rainbow Reef fish! A real hit at the pool!"
1,Fish or Sunken Submarine?,"I bought this toy thinking the kids were going to have fun with it in the pool. They did, but only for a very short time. After the batteries died and we changed them to new ones it became a submarine. It dropped to the bottom of the pool and never re surfaced. Very frustrating."
3,Cute but not too exciting,"We recently purchased a pool and of course the kids wanted some toys to play with in there. We saw the display for these Rainbow Reef Fish and they even had a video continuously playing. Wow, that is really cute we all thought! So we bought one. While it IS cute and does swim around, ours only seems to swim straight and almost above the surface...very unlike how the video portrayed it. Overall though, the kids like the fish swimming around in the pool with them."
2,"some appeal for beginners, but you can do better","This magazine is basically a vehicle for manufacturer ads with a few ""how to's"" randomly thrown in, with little rhyme or reason. If you want to learn the basics of photography you'd be much better off going to your public library or buying a basic book or two. If you want a better overview of current cameras and lenses, go to [...] or subscribe to Popular Photography. Even at a cheap rate, this magazine is just a rag."
3,Sometimes contains good photography articles,"If you're looking for a really good photography magazine then this ain't it. I've been receiving Digital Photo for about a year and it sometimes has good articles. Other times I scan the magazine, find nothing worthwhile, and trash it. I won't renew."
2,Not enough 'good stuff'...,"I got this subscription for my daughter who'd just made her first big splurge on a Canon T4i. My hopes were it would have some nice articles (and photos) and plenty of good tips to help her 'find her photo style'. Instead it's loaded with equipment ads and articles. I'd have no problem if equipment was balanced with artistic and technical substance -- 'how-to's', if you will -- or if there were a few artistic methods with accompanying photos thrown in.I give 2 stars because for the price, I don't feel like I've totally thrown money away (though I do feel bad for the trees who gave their lives...)."
3,Beware this may not play on your computer,"The movie itself was pretty good. However this DVD does not play on computers for some reason. It starts off like normal but when you play the show it keeps skipping forward every 5 seconds making it impossible to watch. I have not had this problem before or since and I even have some movies on DVDR.It will play fine in a DVD player so if that is where you plan to watch it great. The movie was done pretty well but is not CNBC's most in depth program, however it is fun to watch."
4,great gift,"My brother in law loved it. He was impressed with the metal wear strip. Its a large shovel so it can move more snow, faster."
4,A Snow Shovel...,"I just wanted an aluminum snow shovel that wasn't too wide, and that is exactly what I got. All around it is a solid product.The reason for the 4 stars is I am 6'3"", and I wish the length of the handle would've been at least another foot long...for my height this shovel doesn't promote good posture at all, however it will make shoveling easy for my lady when she comes to help me.So in the end I consider it a good buy."
2,barely average...,"Why can't anyone make a shovel that lasts?Why can't anyone make a shovel that doesn't loosen up so that the snow/ice starts sliding off the sides?This shovel is average, at best...this year in the NE we've been pounded by snow...I have two different model Arctic Blasts...both are falling apart...screws loosening, etc...I'd love to get a shovel, regardless of the price, that would last more than one or two big snows..."
1,terrible construction; went back to the supplier,"After (during) one use, the plastic handle pulled away from the wood pole and started rotating around when I tried to pick up heavy, wet snow. All that they needed to do was secure the plastic handle with a longer bolt, so that this wouldn't (couldn't) happen. Anyway, it went back, the snow is now melted, and I'll buy another snow shovel locally when they go on sale here at the end of winter."
4,"A sturdy, lightweight shovel!","Made my way through a foot of snow and ice yesterday with this shovel. First, it's lightweight. That makes a world of difference when you're shoveling your driveway, walkway, porch, and steps. 18"" serves its purpose, but you won't be getting a large scoop of a shovel with this one. For me, that's a good thing because it ensures my shovelfuls are reasonable and my back usually thanks me for it in the morning. Second, it's sturdy. I bang it up between chopping ice and scraping concrete steps. It does bend a bit when you really work it over, but it can easily be hammered back into place if you feel the need. Has not affected the performance of the shovel. Metal blade ensures you get down to the pavement and helps chip away at ice. I'm 5'11"" and have no complaints about the height of the shovel. Plan to get a second one before the next big snowfall. Included several images to provide a visual."
5,Metal Snow Shovel!,"Most of the snow shovels sold these days are made of some form of plastic. They are fine for pushing an inch of snow off a short sidewalk, but not much else. This shovel is metal and was needed the day it arrived for a substantial snowfall. It seems quite sturdy and is fairly light to use. My only wishes were that it was a bit wider and had an ergonomic handle, but I am thrilled to have found this shovel at the Amazon price."
5,Great shovel for a great price,The shovel is extremely well built and I'm sure that it will last for many years. It moves snow very easily and cuts through thick ice with the metal blade. Being able to push the snow around is much better for me than a normal shovel. I hurt my back just before this winter and there is no way I would be able to clear my driveway with a scoop style shovel. Don't waste your money on a plastic shovel if you live in an area with lots of snow and ice!
3,"Good construction, not the best shape","This snow shovel has good construction and feels sturdy in hand. It would be great for areas that don't get much snow, or for smaller shoveling tasks. It does have some drawbacks though for larger snow removal jobs.The shovel is a bit too short for my 5'11"" size. This requires me to hunch a little more than is comfortable and after a lot of shovel I can feel it. Also the blade shape is not idea for pushing snow, it's more suited to cutting into the snow and lifting a chunk, to be deposited after carrying it a little way. If you need a smaller shovel for that purpose it would be great, if, like me, you needed a shovel for clearing a driveway, it's not the best."
5,A logical basis for Christianity?,"Near the end of a ten year study on the Bible and Christianity, involving dozens of books on the subject, I came upon ""The Unfinished Gospel"". Finally it all came together and made some kind of sense. Powell presents, in my opinion, an incredibly sound theory bridging the chasm between rational thinking and the origins of the Christian religion, enabling both to co-exist. Sounds hard to believe, I know, but he really does pull it off. Absolutely a must read for those of us ""cursed"" with a too-logical mind to accept on faith the Christian doctrine. A good book also for any Christian or biblical scholar willing to look objectively at the story from a rational viewpoint. Extremely well written and easy to read."
1,A reader,"I have never, e*v*e*r encountered a worse book in any field in my entire life. Ok, so chapter 4 and 9 are cute - but you know what, you really don't need to write a book to publish 30 pages of material that is actually worth reading.I had a clever teacher who once said: ""If you want to pick mushrooms, go to the forest"" - well, if you want to learn Math, take the bus and head to the math department. The presentation is completely unclear, there is no motivation and the math is treated in a ridiculusly simplified way.According to SLP, to prove a theorem, all you need to do is make assumptions - no need to motivate why you make them - that would be overkill, rather leave it to the reder to motivate (as an annoying exercise).I dream of the day a Mas-Collel of macro economics comes around and writes a comprehensive macro book. Until this day, I am left wiping my behind with chapter 1-3; 5-8; and 10-End. Oh well."
2,almost unreadable,"This book may be a decent reference material, however it is really hard to read and the tendency to leave everything out as excercises for the reader does not help either."
3,Hamiltonian Hills,"My first thought upon encountering this text was ""man, this book is really green"". However, that was probably due to my problems with dichromatism. Once inside, I was convinced that the authors and their school of thought have taken the field of economic jestership to new heights. However, I had to go back outside for some fresh air, and I haven't been back inside for a while. It's too nice and sunny, you know. Join me as I prance naked over the golden hills, my life unencumbered by the patronizing utterances of uncouth ungulates, my mind filled with daffodils instead of dynamic optimization techniques, my schlong swinging in the succulent seabreeze! Your brain is a bouquet, not a black box of baneful baloney! The horizon is not infinite! Set your discount factor to zero! Wohoo!!!"
3,it's okay,this is not exactly the one I have expected to get because it was covered by some grey colored thick paper like copied book. but I guess contents are the same.
2,Very difficult for a first course in economics dynamics,"It's a very difficult book to understand, if you do not have an excellent background on stochastic process, markov chains, vector space optimization, etc. I did not find it very useful."
3,math explanation,i refer this textbook to follow mathematical idea of macro dynamic programming. the excircises are helpful to deepen my understanding.
3,A book in need of a study guide.,"First, let me say that this is an IMPORTANT book; about as important a book on macro that has come out in the last 30 years. That said, it is a horrible book to learn by. It should not bill itself as anything other than a reference book. It doesn't have any examples; just a lot of exercises. By trying to be general, it leaves the beginning student without a clue as to how to apply this in a more concrete context. In short, if ever there was a book in need of a study guide with examples worked out, this is it."
2,You better read something else,"This is among the worst books I've seen in economics. I suggest you read something else in maths such as dynamic programming, stochastic dynamic programming, measure theory to get the neccessary tools instead of reading this book. By studying these serious books in maths, you get the foundations. The arguments do not flow. To much exercises are left for the readers. The explanations are bad and too terse. The references are really bad and creat a lot of diffculties for you to keep track. This book teachs you many thing you can find in Sargent's three books: Dynamic macroeconomics, recursive macroeocnomics and macro theory. But I found those books are much,much more entertaining and systematic. Forget about this book. I first studied this just to get pass with my course requirement however, after that I switched to more serious mathematic books and read Sargent's in complement. That helps."
4,Merz as reviewed by The Occultist,"This book pricked my interest because Merz is a researcher who updates Watkins and Mitchell's study of ley lines in England. Once called 'earth energy' and 'telluric lines' and more recently 'bioenergy', her book addresses a more particular research into ancient sites and the lines of bioenergy or earth's magnetism, their force and vibratory rates..Merz updates equipment used today for her measurements..in my time this was done by pendulum, dowsing rods, and intuition..she also addresses the use of number in archetecture and the accumulation of force at ancient sites in egypt, france, england, etc..i would recommend this book as being well written and pertinent for today.:"
5,I definitely recommend it! GREAT!,"I am an amateur golfer who is always afraid to play under competition.After watching this video, I feel that my golf game has changed forever!!I can now follow the instructions on the Psychology video and eliminate all fear from my golf swing.I strongly recommend this tape.It was great!"
5,Prince of Foxes,"Exceptional novel written by a master of the historical-epic genre. The book follows the life and loves of Andrea Orsini, an erstwhile impoverished Italian nobleman, as he strives to find his destiny in the byzantine politics of Renaissance Italy. The Prince of Foxes was one of several Rafael Sabatini novels made into major motion pictures -- all starring Tyrone Power."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book pretty much sucked, in my opinion. It was just stupid. There were only two scenes that were chilling and thats about it. Stephen King books from the 70s and 80s, and certain ones from the 90s, were the best things since sliced bread. Then they just go downhill from there. I think ol stevie boy is runnin out of ideas. I see why this title is selling for so cheap on here (I bought the Audio CD). Well at least im not out very much money. Oh well, they cant all be winners i guess. But for a Stephen King horror book, this ones pretty lame, tame and anticlimatic."
3,problem with my rating,"One of the problems I have with rating a King novel is that there are so many awesome books to compare it to...e.g. The Shining, The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis. If this were just a stand-alone author, I might have given it 4 stars.I have read King's comments about writing another book about a haunted car (Cristina), but this was a totally different premise. While I did enjoy the ""scary"" aspect of a car in the garage left to spit out remnants of another world and cause disappearances, it was the fraternity of the main charactersthat caused me to enjoy the story. Yes, I cried out ""Don't go in there!"" However, I did not cry out as loud as I did in ""The Shining.""One thing about a King novel, I always remember the story-lineyears after I have read the book. Can't say that about a lot ofother authors I read."
4,"Not his best, but good","Oh, relax. I think King has set the bar so high any little slip by him is seen as a major disappointment. ""From A buick 8"" ain't his best, but it is good.This novel is up there with ""Night of the Beast"" (Shannon) and ""Hour Before Dark"" (Doug Clegg) as one of my favorites of 2002. A little more of a character study than a horror novel but worth your bucks."
5,Very good book.......,"...trust me, if you're an av fan of SK, then you'll ove this book. Forget about this being another car book. It's nothing like the previous."
3,So-so,"This book is so-so. There are many imaginitive story elements, but there isn't really much of a plot. If you're new to King, save this one for later. Start with Desperation, The Dead Zone, Different Seasons, or any of the short story collections."
2,Egad...this poor author's editor must have died,"This would have been a nice, interesting short story. I can't believe I stuck around for the whole thing."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I have been a King fan all my life, but this book left me wondering if maybe it is time for King to retire. I forced myself to read 275 pages, hoping it would get better, but i realized that i really no longer cared what happened and i put the book down, never to be picked up again. The story just keeps repeating itself, a ""lightquake"" takes place, something is ejected out of the trunk, no one really knows what that something is, what it's purpose is, or where it came from, and you never discover the answers to any of these questions. This book may appeal to those who haven't read King from the beginning of his career, but for this ""die-hard"" classic King horror fan this book put me to sleep."
3,King needs a road map.,"King's recent books have been really poor. In both Dreamcatcher and Buick, Stephen seems to have lost his way. There's just nothing here of interest. I'm still a fan of King, but he is slipping. I can only hope against hope the upcoming Dark Tower books will not be this poor, but I fear King's lost his touch."
3,Average at Best,"I keep hearing rumors that this is King's last stand-alone novel, and the only thing he intends to publish for the rest of his career are the final three books of his inferior Dark Tower series. I hope these rumors are false. I'd hate to think his last novel was a book this average. Not a bad book, but certainly not a great one either."
1,YUCK!,"Yet another piece of impish immmature drivel from the master of bad grammer. I would have thought by now the man would have learned the basics of sentence structure and grammer. Since he has a great following, he must hold some quality for the masses which intices them to buy his books. It is obviously neither great writing nor flawless logic as this book demonstrates once again."
1,From A Buick 8,"I have been a Stephen King fan for years. The Stand is possibly the best cross-over SciFi, horror novel that was ever written. I would have to say that From A Buick 8 might be the worst. The only reason I gave this book a single star is because it has King's name. It is a long drawn out read, save your money."
1,Terrible,Don't waste your money on this book..What was he thinking?????Or was he thinking at all? I think not
2,Should have left this one in the closet.,"I'm a big King fan, have all his books in First Editions...I am only half way through it and that in itself says something since I started it weeks ago and usually I can't put his books down... This book does not grip me. ..."
4,Love Anything By King !,I love anything by this man. He is one of my favorite authors. I enjoy all the controversy he usually creates with his intriguing books of fiction!
3,Slipping,"I felt the book leaves the reader waiting for more - for something to happen. I will never forget how ""The Shinning"" raised the hair on the back of my neck. ""Buick 8"" doesn't come close. It builds and builds but never hits the summitt.Not Mr. King's best work."
1,Worst. Stephen. King. Book. Ever.,"I picked up this book in like-new condition at a flea market for $2 (I think I got ripped off). Anyway, I've read my share of S. King books in my days and I gotta say...this is the worst book he has ever written. It's a very painful read and doesn't...you know...entertain like books are supposed to.Stephen King has reached a point in his career where he can publish anything and it will still sell...even if it's a total piece of literary flotsam like this book. If a new author tried to submit this book for publication, it would not be considered good enough to even secure a literary agent. Yeah, it's THAT bad."
2,"Sadly, King's Worst","When I read From A Buick 8, I was actually embarrassed for Stephen King. I believe it's the worst thing he's ever published, right under Gerald's Game.I would encourage fans who've never had the displeasure of reading it to stay away. If you're not a fan and want something light and recent from King, try Full Dark, No Stars. If you want to go straight for the best of King, try It."
2,not my cup of tea,I read this book when it first published. It was a long time before read another king book. I kept wondering if anything was really going to happen. Big King fan but not of this book. It is not my taste...Bag of Bones is more to my liking.
3,Not Bad,"This book was ok. I have read many Stephen King novels. This one just didnt quite compare to the others. Maybe it was not intended to be as ""scary"" as his others. I still continued to read it to find out what happened but with a little less 'gusto'. I will still read SK. This just wasnt one of my favorites. Not enough 'intense, scary, gross' moments!! If that makes sense!"
4,"5 for character development, 4 because it was too long","I thought this was very much the old King, the one who is the master of plot and characterization. No one can capture the nuances of a character better or faster than King.The first 300 pages drag but only if you want a quick summer read. If you like total development of the people and the plot, it's great. The last 150 pages are the best IMO. Fast, action-filled, and the ol' page turner.Hope they make a movie out of it."
5,From A Buick 8,"Once I started reading this book, I found it extremely hard to put down until I had finished. For anyStephen King fan, this is a must have book. From beginning to end the reader is spellbound to find out what is going to happen next. I was expecting something along the lines of ""Christine"" but this is totally diferent, and in my opinion better."
2,One of his weaker stories...,"Imagine reading a book about a bunch of college professors who stare at a spooky trunk full of old college textbooks for over 20 years! Ocassionally an oversized bookwork wiggles out and they freak! Then they go back to teach classes all day haunted by what they have seen. Sounds pretty weak doesn't it? Just swap in a Buick and some state troopers and you have the the terribly weak premise of this novel.The ONE IDEA that constitutes this book can only be drawn out so far (flashing ""portal car"" plops out creatures that decompose ASAP--troopers gawk in amazement!). At some point it all needs to MEAN something, which, in the end, it doesn't. There is always room for a novel that makes the absence of answers its strong point, but this book simply pushes that pretense too far.If you want to be creeped out by the inexplicable I recommend that you read books by the author that obviously influenced King's trunk-born creations--H.P. Lovecraft."
2,Not his best...a little bit boring.,"I've read them all, so I know what I'm talking about. This book was not up to par with any of King's other books (nearly eclipsing Gerald's Game as his worst novel ever). It was kind of interesting at times, but I was (hopelessly) waiting for this book to ""really get going"". It never did. It was an OK read, definetely not a ""page turner"", and, all in all, one that I could have done without. If you want to read some great King novels, start with IT, The Stand, Pet Semetary, or, just about anything else King has written. Don't start with this one...you may never pick up another King novel again."
2,wow..,"A year ago i bought all of Kings books and have read about 14 of them so far. From A Buick 8 has got to be the WORST book i have ever read by king. A car that craps out bats and other stuff? weird...i know King has been known to be a little weird, but this is overboard...anyways..the good in the book is what is good in all of Kings books. the Characters. No matter how horrible the plot is he seems to make believable characters and that is what is so great about him as an author. I would reccommend all of Kings books because he is my favorite author, but i didnt like this book"
4,A solid example of King's writing,"There's something about those cars from the fifties - something that isn't quite natural, and Stephen King knows it. First, there was Christine, a 1958 Plymouth Fury that was simply born bad. Now, Mr King introduces us to a Buick from the same era, a Buick that is equally bad, but very different. Whereas Christine was born on a Detroit assembly line alongside her siblings, this Buick is one of a kind: an impossible, inoperable engine; a steering wheel designed for an ocean yacht and dashboard controls that don't control anything are just a few of its physical traits. But if the car can't be driven, it does have the unsettling habit of inviting guests from time to time - guests you wouldn't invite yourself, if you had the choice. The Buick 8 does have two things in common with Christine, though: it has a peculiar resistance to damage, and although it isn't literature, per se, it makes a very good read."
4,"""Another Page Turner by Mr. King""","""From A Buick 8,"" by Mr. King is another page turner that had me chewing my fingernails until the last page had been read."
2,Not that great,"I was looking forward to this book because I absolutely loved Christine. But.....1) I never cared for the alternate world of Talisman/Gunslinger2) This book is so boring that I put it down for a week to read another book3) I think it would have been a much better 100 page novella than a huge book that it was (does anyone edit for him any more? Maybe he should re-read his ""On Writing"").It wasn't scary. It was fantasy. Quite frankly, I don't care for much for fantasy, so this book is resigned to the bottom of my Stephen King recommendations.Don't get me wrong, he's a good writer, but this baby deserved to be tossed out with the bathwater."
3,"Not bad, but dry for King...","I like Stephen King okay, but tend to find much of his works a little on the wordy side. ""From a Buick 8"" is not what I would label a horror novel - it has a few scary-ish parts, but is more of a memoir from a group of police officers about a particularly strange car they run across. I liked the book alright - I finished it and enjoyed it enough, it's pleasantly rambling (similar to ""Green Mile"") with a lot of little details. Nice, but not one I'll keep around for a second go."
1,quite boring,i'm a great fan of stephen king & would strongly recommend his 'different seasons' to anyone. But this latest story strikes me as being long-winded and not the least scary. one of my most disappointing stephen king read.
1,I love King but......,"this book was really bad. That hurts a lot for me to say b/c I love King, but I have to be honest. Send this one to the scrap heap and sell it for parts.This is the story of a car, and how it changed the life for some officers and the people around them. I can't say much more, b/c I don't want to give away the plot.When I was finished with this book, I had a lot of questions. Such as, what happened to a certian officer? Where did the car come from (though I do have an idea)? Who was the driver?If you want to read it, be my guest, but don't expect this to be vintage King."
2,A prefect mataphor,"In what could have been a very good short story, we follow a car that starts out very frightening and goes out with a whimper. Sounds a lot like a certain writer. Mr. King, take a hint from your own story and finish with a flourish of lights and action, don't let your readers see you rust away.With the exception of a chapter or two this was the dullest S.K. book of them all. Very disappointing. There is a reason that flashbacks don't work for long, even if done by one of the best story tellers of all time."
2,The worst,"This is the worst Stephen King book I haver EVER read. As time goes on, I feel he has lost his touch and run out of ideas, because this was a true stretch. It was almost laughable. I kept thinking, ""surely something will happen to make this book better"", but it never did. It was complete silliness. A complete waste of my time. I was glad when I finally got through it. The only reason I stuck w/it is because I thought being a King novel it would get better. It never did."
1,Disappointment,"This is the worst book Stephen King has written! The plot, if there was one, is silly. He continually leads up to something exciting about to happen which fizzles out to nothing. The terrors are something a small child might dream up. Total waste of money and I was very disappointed."
2,Bad car! Bad!,"OK, so it's a 356-page book about a car that isn't really a car. And the ""car"" just sits in a garage and does some occasional odd things. *Yawn*. In my opinion, this book isn't in the same league as some of King's classics (""The Stand,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" etc.), and isn't even half as good as the more recent ""DreamCatcher."""
3,The wrong Buick on the cover?,So the story is about a 1954 Buick Roadmaster. But that's a 1953 Buick on the cover!
2,"Dull story, dull climax, disapointing ending.","Stephen King's most recent novel was perhaps his worst. The story is more of a series of stories all reflecting upon a rather dull, old, Buick which, frankly, isn't scary. The flat plot gradually leads to vapid climax and finally an ending which cannot even satiate the reader's longing to discover some information about the curiously entriging Buick. Instead of suspence and terror, King points out the human proclivity to inquire about the unknown and question questions that cannot be answered. This leaves the reader unsatified upon closing the book because he/she is without any knowledge explaing the Buick's strange behavior; only the fact that it was their natural desire to question something that could not be answered."
3,should've been a short story,"I have to agree with others that say it's really too long for a novel. The basic idea was ok but although it's always a pleasure to read King's prose, it takes too long and is repetitive."
3,Quite a Disappointment from King,"""From a Buick 8"" actually started out okay, but it eventually went downhill from there. ""8"" is not like your usual HORROR novel from King. Bottomline: There's no real scary part in the whole book. Except for the Buick spitting out some gross 'things' from the trunk and sucking people in, the whole novel just fell flat.The only reason I stuck to the book was to see if there were any other really scary scene in the novel, only to be deeply disappointed. The ending was abrupt and did not seem like an ending at all.To all first time King readers: Don't read ""8"". If you are looking for horror, go for older novels by King like ""Carrie"" or ""Christine"" instead."
2,"Steve: We still wanna love ya, but...","As a diehard SK fan, I wanted to believe that The Master could still do it after all these years. Just my opinion, but he just has not been the same after the car accident.I'll eat my words (with a bit of salt) if The Gunslinger final three books turn out better. But Steve: time to become William Forrester, if you get my drift."
2,Lacking inspiration on this one Stephen,"This is the way Stephen writes by the numbers when uninspired. He fashioned this book to incorporate all the essential elements of proper characterization. He forgot to breathe life into the characters inhabiting this unremarkable town in Pennsylvania. That's too bad for the readers and I really don't think Stephen gives a flip about us anyway. This book is nothing more than a stop gap throw away between ""worlds"" in his ""Gunslinger"" series. That's where he's focusing all his attention ladies and gentlemen and I can't wait to read the next installment. In the meantime, don't waste your money on this one."
1,zzzzzzzzz,"I have read and enjoyed almost every book King his written. I managed to make it through 200 pages before I had to give up. Boring, pointless, unscary. Reading tea leaves would be more entertaining."
4,Strange Story,"I am an unabashed fan of Stephen King - so I bought this book as soon as it came out. In reading it, I found that King had come up with an interesting premise - a car - but not a car - maybe a portal to another universe might be more like it.King tells the story using flashback techniques - and you have to be really observant in reading to have even a wild guess at how this story ends.If you are not familiar with King's other books, this isn't the one to start your experience. Try reading ""Christine"" or ""The Shining"" first to see how King does things.All in all, I enjoyed the book - but it is not for new readers of King."
3,disapointing,"I always eagerly await new works by Stephen King. He's written some great novels and short stories, and his Dark Tower books and the Bachman Books I place on my list of greatest works written, but this novel was such a disapointment. This really would have been a better idea for a short story than a novel. The story kept building to something, and then it would fizzle, before it tried to build again, before ending on a fizzle. King tried too hard to keep this from being Christine, and he suceeded there. This is a substandard story. It's an example of trying to hard to be something it isn't. It's an interesting premise--one that should have been handled in the short story format, or novella at the longest."
1,Run (don't walk) from this book.,"If Steven King wrote this book to indicate that after the car hit him he can no longer write, he is correct! The only reason that I even finished it is because I paid soooo much for it. The plot is completely lame, and nothing exciting even happens until just before the end. I have read and enjoyed Steven King's writing, until now. This book was almost a complete waste of time reading."
2,The joke is on me,"Stephen King's writing style is not in question. So this book isn't based on the same scale as other writers. This book is King vs. King-if that makes sense. Anyway, From a Buick 8, sounds like a story that Mr. King worked on while half dozing on the back porch. The plot is questionable at best, because I'm of the opinion that plot means that we're building TOWARD something. That is not the case in this book. King hyjacked my money for this (an audiobook price tag-which is a lot of money) and laughed all the way to the bank. Overall, DON'T BOTHER. Go out to your own back porch and watch the grass grow. Trust me, it will be more entertaining."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I'm a growing fan of Stephen King having read Needful Things, The Tommy Knockers, Dreamcatcher, The Dead Zone and Misery just to name a few but I honestly couldn't finish this book which is actually sort of sad because its pretty short considering what King writes. But this book lags despite its short length making it feel like an accomplishment when you reach the 100 page mark. King has nice characters, but I was really only mildly interested in the plot. Its one of the few King books that I honestly wouldn't recommend."
4,The attraction of the Unknown,"An interdimensional portal in the form of a Buick is impounded by state troopers who spend the next thirty years guarding the secret of the alternate universe it accesses and the grotesque creatures that occasionally come through from the other side. Although there are several nightmarish, gross-out scenes, this is a quieter King novel, and I found it to be quite successful. It is more about the powerful attraction that the unknown exerts on the human psyche than it is about rampaging monsters. This secret fascination shared by three decades of Troop D officers makes them a close-knit, tight-lipped group and even distances them from their families a bit. The structure of the novel--a group of Troop D old-timers tell the story of the Buick from their various perspectives to the son of a recently killed comrade--is effective and frequently moving."
4,Why stop now?,"Dreamcatcher and Buick 8 are two of the better books I've read. Stephen King continues to get better with each novel, so why stop now? I can understand wanting to take a break ""until further notice"", but hopefully for our sakes he'll get bored in a while and treat us again."
3,Not so good...,"I am a big Stephen King fan. However, I have been very disapointed in his last couple of books. My favorite thing about S. King's writing is how you come to know & like his characters (i.e. IT). I can not say this about this book. The story dragged on. There seemed no real point to it. I am ever loyal & will read everything he writes, but his writing has definately took a turn for the worse."
1,Just awful,"I love Stephen Kings books but this one has to be his worst ever! The whole time I read it I was thinking, ""Is this going somewhere!?!"" The beginning started out OK but then it just went down hill from there. I feel bad for saying this because King is a favorite writer of mine but this was JUST AWFUL."
2,Little plot and lots of filler. In a word: Boring,"This has to be one of the dumbest books ever written, and also one of the most boring. I'm listening to the audio version and I can barely get through it. There is such little action--and so much unnecessary character development--that you want to curl up and go to sleep."
4,good king...not great,"A quick-read page-turner bound to satisfy most King fans.With all the focus on the ""monster"" I did think some of the characters fell off into the background, including Ned. Great picture of rural Pennsylvania, and police procedures in general. King displays his usual fine skill at ratcheting up the tension and the thrills as the novel moves along, although I have to confess the disections-by-cop seemed a bit hard to accept. All in all a good weekend-passing read."
1,Dreadful,"The man who wrote ""From a Buick 8"" also wrote ""Pet Sematary."" Think about it. How the mighty have fallen..."
1,Buick 8 gets a big zero,"Don't waste your time or money on this one Constant Readers. I'm a huge King fan, but this one never even got off the ground. Where most King storiess leave you wanting more, this one leaves you wanting anything but the shear boredom it delivers. Sorry, SK, but you must have written this one in a coma."
2,Boring - doesn't go anywhere,"Not a great book - I like a lot of King's works, but this one is pretty bad. The idea of the story is okay, but it just doesn't go anywhere - very boring reading. Not recommended."
3,A bad way for an amazing author to end his career,"Now i picked this book very happy this was reportedly King's last novel and i wanted to know how King bowed out but this novel which is decent but far from his best work, had little action characters without much personality and a not so great story line. Could have definetly been worse could have been a lot worse though!Thank god we still have the 2 final dark tower books to look forward to!!!"
4,excellent reading,"I think this book is a must read for Stephen King fans. This book is creepy,scary fun. I had to force myself to stop reading so I could get some sleep. People think because ""From a Buick 8"" is about a car it will be another ""Christine"". Not true,in fact the way the book is written...you will probably have more ""Green Mile"" flashback moments than ""Christine"" ones. Not exactly a bad thing right???"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"I received ""From a Buick 8"" as a gift, and I have to say I was appalled at what seemed to me to be a very simplistic novel with easily detectable plot devices, one-dimensional characters and amateur attempts at suspense. I was very disappointed in this book. If you're just getting to know Mr. King, please read the older books first and avoid this one at all costs."
3,"Way too long, needed editing","The story is a nice horror idea - a car that is somehow the portal between worlds, sucking people in and spitting out things from the other side. It acts up periodically. Nobody knows why it's there or how it got abandoned at a gas station in western PA, but the state police decide to be its custodians.This would have been good at half the length, 225 pages instead of 450. Most of the book is just padded out with material that does nothing to add to or improve the story or draw the characters. It's just padding and it gets repetitive, too. I started skimming, to finish the book already."
3,He has done better.,I have be a voracious reader of King for some time. His books are as easy to read as they are for him to write. This one was a bit of a let down for two reasons. I felt the book was not one he really focused on too much plus it wasn't as appropriate for my 14 year old son as I had hoped. I did like some of the connected characters from other books like the Dark Tower series.
5,The Pennsylvania State Police Have Problem,"Where did this weird replica of a Buick come from? Was the portal made by the same characters in ""Hearts of Atlantis""? If it was, why didn't they have a problem breathing our atmosphere? Will King eventually tie it all together like he did with the entire ""The Gunslinger"" series? The whole point of the book is, sometimes you have to accept the fact that you aren't going to find an answer."
3,Good read on a long winter's day,"This book a has slow as a long summer's day. Don't expect to be spook out of your bed but if you are a die hard fan of King like myself, you will enjoy this tale of a boy you will become a man because of a car. I miss the writing of his first books. Maybe it will come back to him. Hopefuly!"
3,too many low reviews ought to tell you something,"I do not see where the 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from. This wasn't a bad book-just not a really good one. Mr. King has been slipping in the quality department recently. This book doesn't really seem to go anywhere. It was a fairly quick read, but not terribly filling."
2,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FROM A GREAT WRITER,"There was a time when you knew you were going to get a great story because the name Stephen King was printed on the dust jacket. But those books are few and far between. I can't recommend this book to anyone. I stick with SK because I hope to get another SALEM'S LOT, GREEN MILE, or MISERY. Every once in a while SK will sneak up on you and deliver a gem, but he's been shooting blanks for a long time. I'm getting really tired of waiting and reading and being sorely disappointed. Only King's great prose carry you through this mercifully short novel."
1,Boring!!!,"Long winded, not well written, lacks a story line that is somewhat believable, no real character developement, repeats itself in places, ending about as exciting as a root canal! Don't waste your time or money on this one!!"
3,Not his best.,I'm a long time fan. He's without a doubt the best. This is not his best work. It started out good but didn't really seem to go anywhere.
2,An exercise in writing and nothing more...,"If this book were not written by Stephen King nobody would read it except his creative writing instructor. Skill in characterization, metaphor and dialog plus an unusual narrative structure don't add up to anything more than an experiment gone wrong. It probably should never have been published. 2 STARS for skill in composition, nothing for story or motivation."
1,Possibly King's Worst. Zero rating.,"I think before this even came out, people were saying, ""What? Another book centered around a car?!"" But, you still have to have an open mind; it could have been good for all we knew ... right? Wrong. The first 100 pages of this book will put you to sleep, going on and on about the backstory of how this car from another world, found it's way into the lives of some very boring state troopers. If you don't fall asleep buy then, the rest is equally, if not more boring and time spent when you could have been reading some authors that WILL scare you, and write more complex in the process: Clive Barker is the first to come to mind, even The Manhattan Hunt Club, by John Saul was better than this. Also check out, Bentley Little for a good scare. pass this one up. I love King's old stuff, this has got to go. Sorry, Stephen. Zero rating. 0000000000."
1,Worthless!,This book is pure garbage. Don't waste your time. Even if you're a Stephen King fan. Awful!
1,Boring,I have read most of King's books. I can honestly say that this is the most boring book I have read by him. I haven't even finished it and I find myself feeling like I have homework whenever I pick it up (I have a thing about finishing any book I start). I also keep finding myself skipping paragraphs because they are soooo wordy (for lack of a better adjective :o)).I hope he does better in the future.
2,Zzzzzz,"I've read everything Stephen King's published, and if it has come down to mediocre stuff like this then it is probably best that the rumors are true and Mr. King isn't going to write any more stand alone novels. It's sad in a way...like Michael Jordan getting to the point where he is no longer able to hold a basketball.I'm looking forward to the last Dark Tower books (which have been his strongest recent stuff and excellent - including the short story in his recent collection of short essays), but I have to say that for a dyed (or is it ""died""?) in the wool Stephen King fan the current book is better suited to putting you to sleep at night than keeping you up turning pages."
2,Could Have Been A Good Short Story,This is typical of King after his initial glory. It gets off to a good start and the possibilities seem interesting. But then nothing happens. There is the occasionally disembodied event but they never go anywhere. It is set in Western Pennsylvania not Maine and in the afterward the author explains why. To me this is a prime example of the reality that his publisher would print his laundry receipt and it would sell so no editor would ever have the nerve to say this is 200 pages too long. King makes his usual snide political comments. This was written in 2002 and as we know the author's concern for nutty domestic militia movements is what America had to keep its eye on at the time. My wife got it from a discount bin so I'm not out much but it was still overpriced.
2,Interesting ultimately disappointing book.,In a nutshell this book is basically about a group of close knit police officers whose lives are disrupted by a mysterious car that every so often turns the air cold and spits out some strange dead creatures.Admitedly unique with likable characters but the problem is the thing is more odd than scary.Another problem is that most of the book is made up of the recollections of different characters so very little seems to happen.Fortunately King has decided to write again and hopefully in Cell he'll have a more compelling tale to tell.
3,It doesn't really go anywhere...,"This book is more frustrating than anything else. Though the plot is fairly interesting and in some parts somewhat suspenseful, the book leaves you with a bucket load of unanswered questions. The car obviously ties in with The Dark Tower series and Hearts in Atlantis, but the finish leaves you with a ""what was that?"" feeling. Without reading the other books, I would have really felt left in the dark. Read it if you have a lust for King, but if you are a newbie to his world (or worlds, as the case may be), read a few of his other works before trying to tackle this one."
2,"Nice concept, but no substance","I hate to agree with some of the other critics who say this book is too long and boring, but... it is.I was able to hang in .. happily.. for the first 200 pages or so... but it gets old rather quickly. Most of the book is just a constant stream-of-conscience recollection of this evil Buick in a garage, and there are layers and layers of smarmy, state-troopers-are-a-family mentality. Which is all fine and dandy, but it's just not what one would expect from a Stephen King book.King is a wonderfully talented author, of course, but-- unless you have a particular interest in state troopers, Pennsylvania, or vintage Buicks, I'd pass on this book."
3,Not the old man's best work...,"If this book had been written by Joe Schmoe, I would have given it at least 4 stars... however, I'm rating on the King scale and as a dedicated fan, I felt it was not worthy of more than 3. To me, it felt like one of his short stories, but much longer, without the full character development that his novels usually provide.I basically didn't give a ... about the characters in the story... except maybe for Mister Dillon. I buy King's books to scare the bejeezus out of myself or to fall in love with the characters and become a part of their lives... this book did neither for me. It was an entertaining bit of fluff but not his best work. I would recommend it to someone who wanted to pass some time, but not to a die-hard fan (they will all read it regardless of outside opinions, such as mine) and certainly not to a first-timer for fear they would be turned off forever."
2,Not up to STANDARDS,"First, let me state I am a HUGE Stephen King fan. I own most of his books and read/reread/rereread them time and again. But I was sorely disappointed with From A Buick 8. There were times when I wanted to just put it down and move on. It did not have have the gripping storyline I have come to expect. It did not have characters I was really interested in. It did not have compelling dialogue and was more of a standard kind of story with some science fiction added in. I have read Stephen's comments as regards this book and he is right. I am not sure if it was done to satisfy a contract or to fill in the gap while finishing the Dark Tower series. In any event I am sure it is not a book I will be picking up again any time soon. Not on my recommended reading list for anyone, least of all a Stephen King fan..."
3,It's OK....but just OK,"I am somewhat disappointed in the book....it was interesting, but I kept waiting for the pizzazz.....I did not require a real horror story...some of his best are not.....but I usually finish his books quickly....this time it took me over two weeks..a few pages at a time.... it just did not ""Grab"" me."
2,Really disappointing,"King remains a master of simile, but this book had little suspense, few surprises, and a plot that just dragged on and on and on. I found the book a good 1/3 longer than it needed to be--and with a very unsatisfying resolution. If you want vintage King, read The Stand or Needful Things."
2,Zzzzzzzz,"This was my least favorite King novel. I just kept waiting for something - anything - to happen, and I was disappointed. There really was no big payoff that is typical for a SK novel. The characterizations were very good, but it didn't make up for the fact that I am spoiled when it comes to a big ""bang"" in the end."
3,"OK, I get it.",The book could have been written in half as many pages and eliminated much retelling of the same story. Not a bad book just more than was really required.
3,"""The King Of Strange Reads""","I have to honestly admit that I usually do not enjoy most books in this category as they tend to be a bit too strange for my tastes. I know, I know, like dah, huh! Hey, this book was a gift (the reason I am reviewing it.) I am a person who doesn't receive that many gifts, and if you knew me better you could plainly understand why.Moving Forward... ""From a Buick 8"" although a strange story wasn't that bad. I think I liked it better than my last read by Stephen King. If you are a King fan this story is right up your alley."
2,King's Latest is Lamest,"Well, perhaps not his lamest, but very, very close. As someone who has read and re-read every King book, I was relieved that this hastily slung together rehashing of familiar King territory will be his ""last."" Then again, King can shine in certain places and his amazing ability to bring you inside a character's consciousness almost makes it worth it to suffer through. The bottom line: if you're a King junky, you're going to read it no matter what."
5,"Apparently, some King readers are incapable of suspending their disbelief","I really don't understand all the negative reviews on this novel. Why do so many people think that a Stephen King novel has to be gory and gross-out before it can be entertaining? I absolutely loved this novel when I read it. I believe it is far superior to many of King's other novels--even CELL. The main reason I loved it was that it's so different from anything else he's written. I guess you could call it his most ""Fortean"" novel with just a little touch of H.P. Lovecraft thrown in for good measure.I would like to recommend to all the negative reviewers of BUICK that they sit down and read THE COMPLETE BOOKS OF CHARLES FORT which is also available here on Amazon. The volume is actually four nonfiction works combined in one book. They do make for a tedious read, but they'll be well worth your while. Sit down and read them, and maybe you'll begin to understand where King was coming from when he wrote FROM A BUICK 8."
2,"Hearts of Atlantis, Christine, Buick 8...","Stephen King has written some of the best literary works I have ever had the priviledge to enjoy...The Stand, It, and yes...even Pet cemetary.""From a Buick 8"", is nothing but a recollection of memories from the point of many individuals.It lacks the mind games, which King is so good at playing.King has reduced his talent to protraying the twisted personalities of inanimate objects, and Buick 8 is the ultimate low point. It has no plot...no intrigue...no Heart...nothing to capture the imagination, and send us off on one of the imaginary journeys he is so capable of creating.A word of advice to Mr. King. Go back to your roots and stretch your imagination, rather than dredging up the same old bad car...good car stories, such as this...They are becoming very boring.I look forward to the next creative masterpiece Mr. King is so very capable of producing."
1,From a Buick 8: A Novel,"Remember Bob Dylan, before the motorcycle crash. Then after the crash.This is similiar...Boring!I have never ..ever ..been.. bored ..before by S King..It a ok story..but not up to previous standards.Good luck in retirement Stephen.."
2,Correct Nomenclature,"The picture of the sign is not how it looks when you get it.The picture is correct.It should not be SB-2C , it should be SB2C."
4,Good,"This book calls the music industry ""solid gold"", but is it really this way? The gold is there and shines brightly, but the hardships of getting in and staying in the business smudge the gold with black ink, the same ink that flows over dozens of contracts and agreements that have to be signed every year, constraining artists and producers ever more. This handy book shows you that the gold isn't as golden as it seems, with insight information and interesting articles about the evolution of law in the music business."
2,Not a heavyweight,"I was very disappointed in this shirt. I am an ISU Alum and wanted a T-shirt with their logo. This shirt is very thin and arrived with small holes near the neck in a seam line. The company did refund my money. However, I won't shop with this supplier again. Poor quality."
1,A complete fraud,"So I bought this together with the Language Booster, and little did I know that they are the EXACT same product. The lessons in the Builder and Booster are word-for-word identical. Why they are priced so differently beats me: it's most likely a marketing trick to fool people into buying both (like I did). So beware, don't buy both!"
3,Important advice this CD is REMIXes of Sinclair's songs,"I bought this CD but the information don't explain that are remixes of his songs.If I most know that beofre, I bought other cd of Bob sinclair"
4,Car visor collection!!,"Just bought the album for two very nice songs and at first I have to admit I was scared that those were the only good songs and I wasted my money, but after hearing it several times I got to like most of them a lot!!Now the album it's part of my at hand car collections of disks hanging on visor!Definitely a good buy!!"
4,Long overlooked gem,"I got this when it first came out and was not overly impressed because it sounded too metal compared to the earlier stuff which I loved. But lo and behold I pulled it out recently and more than 20 years after its release it holds up very well. In a weird way it sounds less dated now than when it was released amid a lot of the metal-funk-punk crossover stuff happening back then. It has a great chunky sound, the playing's top notch as you'd expect and the songs are pretty catchy. I'll be listening to it a whole lot more now."
5,Incredible,"Great, great songwriting. Mackie on the drums is reason enough to check this cd out. Get it!!!"
4,Essential hardcore!!,"Absolutley one of my favorite Bad Brains albun after Rock for Light. From HR's opening scat of ""Soulcraft"" you know you're in for a real Bad Brains record. Every song is great and well crafted while it also introduces their signature odd stop-start riffing style that came to represent later Bad Brains. If your into hardcore/reggae you MUST get this if you dont already have it."
5,What a great uplifting read.,"The book All I need to know in life I learned from romance novels is a unique and creative way of looking at how we relate to one another. The author states pretty much throughout the book that she says that how life turns out is pretty much up to each individual. The book has me thinking that my relationships are up to me to make them work out, that nothing comes easy or should be taken for granted. I am more than happy to submit a positive review."
5,Exhilarating and mesmerizing to say the least.,"I am not one to do book reviews, but after reading All I need to know in life I learned from romance novels, I could not resist the chance to show my support for this wonderful piece of literary work. The book has me thinking positive about relationships, that I make the choices as to whom I associate with, and that life can have a happy ending."
2,Very slow and boring. Interesting enough though.,"This book takes a long time to read. One of the reasons is because it is so boring. It does help you get a good idea of what life was like in the medieval times though. Out of the 297 pages, there about five times when I got really interested. The rest of the time, I felt like I was going to fall asleep. Although I am a very avid reader, I am only 14 years old, so an older reader might enjoy this book a little more. If you are looking for a book that gives a good description of the medieval time period get this book. If you are looking for an exciting book, don't even pick it up."
1,Terrible!,"I was required to read this book for a religion class assignment. If I did not have to read this book, I would have surely dropped it after the first page! This book is incredibly difficult to undersand and difficult to follow. If you are thinking of buying this book, I would like to warn you against it!"
3,Wreath,"This book is a nice, easy read. The character descriptions are great, and as the plot develops your opinions of the characters will change. Even as Kristin (the main character) changes, the way she sees and describes other characters changes. This is an interesting tale of a daughter and her father and her journey from his loving home into her own as she matures."
2,"product was as stated, but subscription price was just for first purchase --- then it went up.","product was as stated, but subscription price was just for first purchase --- then it went up. The fine print says they will ship without telling you that the price has gone up."
2,Not exactly what we ordered,Seller did send product but it was not in the form we ordered. Normally it would not have been an issue except for that the person taking these cannot tolerate capsules and needed the caplets we ordered.
1,jordan rubin cant be trusted he has made up i lie after the other,"look up jordan rubin scam you will see his credential are fake he said he he earned degrees in nutrition but he lied he bought fAKE DEGREES. and his story is a fake made up for money. he cant prove he was sick . and his company cant prove his story , he was fined by the fda over 200.000 thousand go look it up he is no expert he lies like one so becarful in takeing anything he sells or garden of life. so buyer beware"
5,probiotics,"My doctor first recommended this product for me after a heavy round of antibiotics. I used it sporadically at first, but when I realized I was battling an entrenched yeast infection I realized I needed to use it daily. I then recommeded it to my son-in-law. He was eliminating more and more foods from his diet because they caused stomach pain and diarrhea. He was so happy when the condition improved. This is not a cure-all, but it really helps."
3,Made me a little ill.,"Good product, but the side effects gave me a lot of problems with my stomach. I should've researched more beforehand."
1,This causes HORRIBLE GAS! BEWARE!,"I too spent my hard earned money on this stuff beleiving all Dr Jordan Rubin said, and ended up with worse digestiveproblems like I have never had before in all my 50 years!The bloating and gas were so horrible it caused me to miss work!Does the term ""Swamp gas"" conjure up what I am talking about?so so horrible.Maybe it doesnt do that to everyone, but this was how it affected me andat first I just couldn't beleive it was this product. But when I discontinued, it stopped. Then Ithought maybe I should try just one more pill and sure enough! PAIN! GAG! HORROR!DO NOT buy this stuff!!If you do, don't say I didn't warn you!!I now take bifidis and lactobaccillus and all is well!"
5,Primal Defense Helps Me,I have had Chrones Disease and significant intestinal problems and I've been taking Primal Defense for the last several months. They have a nice earthy healthy smell not like most vitamins and I wouldn't be without them. Just because the establishment is after Jordan doesn't mean his products don't work.Tim McMahon
4,Great Probiotic,"This stuff is better than yogurt, or most other barnds out there, and yes it's expensive - but hey you get what you pay for."
5,Cinematic piece of art,"The skill of this author as a storyteller is unparalleled, its like watching a movie not reading a book. As for the critics claiming the lack of referencing, yes, you might be correct, but I double-checked several doubtful historic facts and they are all accurate.Hatem A Tawfik, MDCairo Egypt"
2,Lightweight history reporting,"This is history as Mickey Kaus or Matt Drudge would have reported it, if they were around at the time. Too gossipy and and too much invented, or imagined dailogue. While i did find some interesting new facts about this important period in Western culture, it was in the end, hard to finish this book because of the general tone."
5,Great Read,Fascinating read and deeply involving. Never made the connections between Columbus and Spain that Reston explored. Highly recommend it.
4,Dogs of God very interesting,Great book. Does take the romance out of Columbus discovering America. This is the second Reston book I've read and I would recommend this book to anyone. Lots of characters but Reston's style makes it easy to keep them straight. He also makes it easy to see what is going on in different countries and how actions influence outcomes.
4,Very cool -- literally,"After all these years it's very liberating to go wireless. And the fan is a great feature, keeping your hands cool and dry even during marathon sessions of gaming. The controller ""feels"" different, so it takes a little getting used to, but after a while it's extremely comfortable. My hands don't cramp up nearly as much as they did with the standard PS2 controller. I haven't had any problems with my Air Flo, although I'll have to admit I was a little bit disappointed that it doesn't seem to work as a remote when you're using the PS2 as a DVD player."
2,"steep price, content lacking at times","This book possesses the unfortunate combination of a high price and too many missing book titles. Not a good value for the money, in my opinion."
1,Save your money and get levels online,"There are levels for a lot of books, but I only found maybe a dozen or so that I hadn't already leveled by looking at websites and searching for leveled book lists. I later checked out Scholastic's website for their leveling system, and it puts this book to shame. I found one Goosebumps book in this book (out of fifty), Scholastic had tons- maybe 25 were leveled. I found a lot of the massive holes left by going book by book through Fountas and Pinnell were filled in. Save your money."
2,The Copper Beech,"So far, Tara Road and The Glass Lake were awesome. You cannot put them down.But The Copper Beech was dull and oddly written. Too confusing for me."
3,The Copper Beech,"This is the story of an Irish village called Shancarrig. The book tells different stories of the lives of people living in the village, each chapter gives the story of a different character, some likeable some not so. If you like short stories you ll love this... it's a long story spanning over 20 years written in the style of several short stories. The final chapter gives us the run down on what happened to all the characters mentioned in the short stories.Typical Maeve Binchy novel, if you like her writing you ll enjoy this book."
2,"Binchy, but not at her best","The Irish storyteller describes the residents of a small town in interesting detail, with all their shortcomings and quirks. The difficulty with this book is that there are so many characters, it can be confusing. Binchy, after introducing most of them in the first part of the book, then spends a chapter on each one but it is easy to get lost. This tale seems more loosely connected than most of the author's wonderful stories. It's not a bad read, but definitely not her best."
5,Binchy loves her characters and so will you,"If I had to specify one criterion which I use to decide whether I will like a piece of fiction, it is this: It must have characters that I care about. The best books have characters that I actually love, at least as long as I'm reading the book. Binchy, more than any writer of my acquaintance, LOVES her characters. Even those who are a bit irresponsible, even those who are weak, are portrayed with sympathy and understanding. ""The Copper Beech"" is vintage Binchy, populated with characters who are smart and not-so-smart, weak and strong, rigidly ethical and on the make. But we come to accept all of them as part of our cozy and deeply satisfying world. Besides being a terrific read, ""The Copper Beech"" will cause you to be a bit less judgmental of your fellow man, at least for awhile.Stan (wonteach@cei.net)"
2,Not one of Binchy's best efforts,I found this a disappointment from one of my favorite authors. The character development was sketchy and the simultaneous stories told separately hard to follow and ultimately unfulfilling. The final denouemoent was interesting but the ending seemed hurried.
2,Alright,"I started this book thinking that it was probably very good. It sounded interesting. The first story about Maddy was wonderful and it even made me cry, something books rarely make me do. I couldn't wait to read the next stories. They must be as great. Maura started out good but it tried to hard to pull at your heart and I didn't really like it. Then there was Eddie and that was SOOO good! It made me laugh and make me really happy. Then from there it went down. All it was were scandalous love affairs and just boredom. I kept waiting for the next Maddy or Eddie but it just didn't happen. Nora Kelly was alright, but the rest were just awful. Now I don't think much of Maeve Binchy. Such a shame since she can obviously write well like in those two chapters."
5,A Colorful Read,I'm not a Maeve Binchy fan or anything but this book was good enough to keep me up late at nite reading it. I love all her characters in the book. They're all so colorful. You have to read it.
2,The copper beech,Not as good as some of her other books. Jumped around too much & plot did not hold my attention
4,Charming story,"Though it took me a while to sort all the names, this book is a lovely telling of the story of a town told from all angles. The different narrative voices are a bit confusing at first, but come together beautifully to tell the stories of the children of Shancarrig as they move into their adult lives."
2,"Not Bad, But Not Her Most Uplifting Work, Either","The other Binchy works I have read, Tara Road, The Glass Lake, Circle of Friends, even the Return Journey (a book of short stories) seem more balanced than this. Those seemed to address both the ups and downs of life. The Copper Beech seems more focused on the despairs. It is not poorly written, just a bit of a downer. Definitely not something to read if you are pregnant, as I am at the moment."
1,Pedestrian,"I had never read Binchy and was not expecting much, since she regularly appears on bestseller lists. The entire plot can be summarized by the last chapter in which all of the characters lives are resolved into happy, rewarding ones with a wave of Binchy's word processor. Conflicts are resolved offstage, probably because she cannot write about anything more intense than a walk in the woods. Married couples are rewarded with precisely 3 children by the book's end and self-sacrificing types, like Maura, who is a thief and blackmailer, are given the town's love and sympathy. The world Binchy is writing about never existed; she completely ignores the challenges of historical setting and character development for the pablum of pop fiction."
3,"Good read, but not Maeve's best work","If you're like me and you read a lot of Maeve Binchy, this one is a little repetitive and uses many concepts from earlier stories. While still worth a read for the wonderful descriptions of a small Irish town and it's inhabitants, it isn't one I would pick up again and again. ""Circle of Friends"", ""Firefly Summer"" and ""Glass Lake"" are much better. My favorite of all is ""Light a Penny Candle"" - one of the best books I have ever read of this genre."
4,Irish dreams,"What a delightful read this is! It's the story of the lives of the inhabitants of a tiny Irish village from the 50's onwards, with an emphasis on the pupils of the small village school. The three roomed school is built under the shade of a huge Copper Beech tree on which generations of children have carved their initials. The pupils range from the elite of the village, the Major's daughter, the solicitor's son and the daughter of the hotel owners, to the desperately poor offspring of the town dressmaker and the town drunk, with a few adults thrown in for good measure, such as the spinster who yearns for the young priest, the school teacher couple who can't have children of their own and the hotel owners who are trying to improve their social status. Add to the plot a covered up murder, a randy bachelor and a romantic wife who's looking for some extra spice in her life and it all makes for a good, meaty read which is difficult to put down. Maeve Binchy fans will love it!"
4,Very Cute!!!,"I am a very selective reader, but I really did enjoy reading ""The Copper Beech"". I liked how the chapters were assigned to different characters, through that you got to know the town & see their lives through every angle.I do regret that I owned this book for 2 years before I made myself read it,it was very good, and I should have read it sooner. This book was filled with wonderful stories that were truly moving. I got caught up in them---they were so inventive. I would absolutely recommend this book--I love Maeve & it was very good!!!"
3,Phoebe Finds Hickey,"Ssmuel Fraunces asked his daughter, Phoebe to go out and be a spy and look for someone that has a name that starts with a letter T. She has to spy because whoever's name starts with T, will kill General Washington. Phoebe is afraid at first, but then she says yes when she hears that her dad is upset tht they were going to kill General Washington. I liked this history book because Phoebe was brave and willing to do what her father asked her to do."
5,"Phoebe, the spy who is 13",Phoebe is a spy who is 13. In 1776 Phoebe got a job and that was to save General Washington. She had to look for a bodyguard who was trying to kill him. She was told that his first name started with the letter T. I really liked this book.
4,Phoebe and George Washington,"Phoebe got a job as a housekeeper for George Washington. Phoebe tried to save George Washington's life as well as herself.Phoebe sees her dad every day to tell him what she has learned. I think the book is very interesting, because it tells what happened back then."
2,Will Hickey get the General?,"PhoebePhoebe Fraunces is a girl whose father, Samuel gave her a important misson to save General George Washington's life. The person who was trying to kill the General is named Thomas Hickey. If you want to know more, read the book."
4,PPB Rally Fan in Boston,"Colin McRae 2 is a great game. My comparisons are to V-Rally 2 which is also available for playstation. It appears that the physics of car motion in CM2 are slightly more realisting to VR2 and the crashes/damage is more realistic. In straight Rally mode, where it's you against the clock, CM2 has the edge. Where CM2 really loses is in it's arcade mode where you can race against others head to head. The car lacks any ""feeling"" and slides around too much. This is where VR2 is much better. VR2 has a ""Trophy"" mode which retains the realistic characteristics available in rally mode but allows you to race head to head with others.The Verdict: If you are interested in realistic Rally Mode with damage, etc, racing solo on track against other drivers' times, CM2 is the way to go. If you do a lot of racing with buddies, or like racing against other cars on track, VR2 is better."
5,English Translations of Non-English Song Titles,"In order to at least comprehend the meaning of the non-English song titles, here are the English translations of those non-English song titles:1. Manchmal ist ein Tag ein ganzes Leben( Sometimes a Day Is an Entire Life )2. Was dann( What Then )3. Ich kann nich' mehr( I Cannot Do It Anymore )4. Mach dir keine Sorgen( Do Not Worry/Make No Worries For Yourself )5. Ohne Ende( Without End )6. Alles viel zu schoen( Everything Is Much Too Beautiful )7. Was immer du tust( What You Always Do )8. Conversation( English Title )9. Bongo Girl( English Title )10. You Don't Have to Cry( English Title )11. Mein Koenig( My King )12. Keine Luegen mehr( No More Lies )13. Weit ueber den Ozean( Far Over the Ocean )14. Outro( English Title )"
5,Excel is definitely one of my personal favourites (No Joke),"I don't know why I bought this album, but I sure am glad that I did. I always considered Excel more Heavy Alternative than Heavy Metal, but all there songs are fast and heavy, albeit with more of a Punk / Alternative feel to them than anything else. A friend of mine said about them ""Nothing special, there are tons of bands like this out there"", but he was definitely wrong! It's too bad they never achieved mainstream popularity and made it big, because I would have loved to hear what they would have come out with next. Oh, and song 4 from this album starts off amazingly like ""Enter Sandman"", but it was released 2 years before Metallica's ""black"" album, so you can judge their talent level for yourself! A definite recommendation."
4,Great for anyone who cares about school lunch and kids,"As dietitian who works at a residential treatment program for older youths and teens with behavioral problems, this is great!! I say that I am a registered dietitian to state that I have much experience with the lousy food we feed our kids.This book is filled with information and government agencies you can contact to help upgrade your local school. The recipes are not all to my taste as I am a vegan and really want more emphasis on plant based entrees. There has been more good studies on the connection between high frutose corn syrup and behavioral issues than when this was published. However, if you don't know the ins and outs of school lunch this is a great resources.Thanks,Marty Davey, MS, RD[...]"
3,Good book for education purposes..,"I bought this book for more ideas, rather than a lesson on healthy eating and therefore was a little disappointed. I have the Laptop Lunch System, which I have been using for a few months, but was looking for lunch ideas. Did not use the book much for this."
3,Have not read the book at this time,Have not had a chance to read this book but thought it would be good in preparing healthy meals for my picky 4 year old graddaughter.
4,Great Lunch Box Ideas,Great ideas for the picky eater and this helps add ideas to the mundane lunch box routine
5,no-nonsens,"This book goes beyond good ideas for kid's lunches' recipes. The author calls for parents to become active in the school system, to prevent waste, to educate children about food and proper nutrition. This is a no-hype, no-false-promises book. It educates and calls for action. I respect the author for doing that. Another no-nonsense book that I also highly recommend is Can We Live 150."
2,My dog doesn't like it.,"It's a little too pointed and sharp for my dog. I use different tools(plastic comb, furminator and brushes), however every time I use this one she gets up and leaves even though I use it very cautiously. I have a Bernese, so lots of hair. I think my plastic comb and furminator work much better."
4,Fantastic!,This song is a great work that shows maturity beyond the years of the members of Ultimate Kaos... excellent work
5,Exquisite!,"This is a terrific tome! Just about the time you think great Bible-era fiction has dried to the bone, along comes Vada M. Gipson's The Quests to shake you of that notion. This book is fresh, vivid and utterly relevant to this modern world. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Gipson's work!"
2,Good tape until you try to take it off,"Bought 3 packs of the black tape at a great deal. I was trying to be frugal and get some less expensive bar tape. The carbon texture is a bit shiny and I worried that it might be slick in the rain, but it felt fine when wet. On the bike, this bar tape works as well as any other.After a couple of months I needed to remove it for some cable maintenance. Well, that is when I found this tape not to be such a great deal. The adhesive on the underside of the tape is strong and when removing the tape, it tore apart, leaving only a strip of material on the bar where the adhesive backing was.After picking, peeling, and using some adhesive remover, I was finally able to remove the rest of the tape. I still have 2 packs of bar tape that will go unused. Anyone out there who needs to rewrap their bars and would not need to rewrap them again for a while, this might be the tape for you. Hey maybe I'll send you a pack. ;)"
5,Superstars Lend A Hand,"I must admit, the reason I ordered this 20th Anniversary DVD was to see Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Ray Charles, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross--all in the same room again. They are all amazing talents, that checked their ""egos at the door,"" that night back in 1985. They were there along with a number of other singers, to help a nation of starving people have a chance at life. There are some priceless outtakes of the late Ray Charles, Stevie, Cyndi and Bruce that had me thoroughly entertained. This is definitely worth buying. I believe a portion of the money from Amazon will be going to the Tsunami Relief fund and other worthy charities."
5,a masterpiece that you must own!!,"I love this DVD. So much inspiring and true that you'll sure gonna love it. Beautiful performances, touching but most of all get it to help the dying since the money you're paying go directly to those who need it!"
5,Happy,"I'm really pleased with my purchase, it was delivered just as described and I'm looking forward to watching it. Thanks heaps."
5,GET THIS!,"You have to buy this! After all these years it is excellent.While you're watching it you feel as though it was just put out this year. I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!! Worth every penny and then some!!!!"
5,brings back good memories,I got this and watched and it brought back such good memories. All these famous personalities banding together for a cause. I love the behind the scenes. Just a really good thorough DVD and then of course the actual video! AND I loved seeing my Main Squeeze Steve Perry!!!!
5,Awesome,We all have to come together and help each other no matter what position you are in.This is what it's all about you don't have to be a star.It makes me feel good to help others so let's not forget it's better to give than receive.
5,Heartwarming...,"I finally purchased this DVD and I really enjoyed watching it. I think it's interesting how this was all arranged and how well they all worked together to get it done. Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie should have been filmed a lot more for DVD because they wrote the song, but I loved the footage of Michael practicing his part. Even after all this time, it was still very enjoyable."
5,Super!!,"I have yet to buy this on DVD, but Ican do great by getting the mp3!!I remember the Video of this,and I watch it alot because ofthe vocals and because ofit's uniqueness- the fact it's forworld relief of hunger makes it more amzing..If there is a song like this, there should bea song for every possible problemin the world-- unrealistic- but itwould be a better place-- a song dedicatedfor the relief of AIDS, song dedicatedto Mr Rogers...this song is the first songI ever heard that had real meaning behind it..."
5,WOOHOO,got my book today and soo happy to have my collection of utena tenjo she is such a great character and standing up for herself i love each book greatly the series is great and the book is less strange than the anime ;)
5,Excellent,This DVD is highly recommended to use as teaching and just learning of God's wonders. I truly enjoyed it.
2,trying too hard to be the blood brothers,i think this band is trying way too hard to mimic the blood brothers original sound. skip this band and check out the blood brothers.
5,One of the greatest albums of all time!,"I bought this a year ago cause I liked the cover - it hasn't left my car's cd player since! The album is simply amazing, raw rock is truly the krunkest thing of all time!Others here have rated the invidual tracks, and I agree with them, but Mouth Like A Magazine, Welcome to Plainfield Tobe Hooper (my favorite!), Stabbing Art to Death and Matthias Replaces Judas are not to be missed!Oh and if you ever get a chance to see Showbread live, DO NOT MISS them! They are quite possibly better in concert than they are on the album!Raw Rock kills, get ready to die"
4,Great,Showbread is not screamo. For the fans of 70's rocknroll like international noise conspiracy and things like refused but with more noisy guitar riff
5,Showbread showed me,this band is fresh and ready to rock pick this CD up or else ummm... ull regret it
5,Very amusing satire.,"I read this play for a French Lit. class (in the original French)and enjoyed Moliere's sense of humor. I laughed out loud as I watched everyone's plans go horribly awry. A great classic social commentary. It centers around one man's obsessive fear of cuckoldry (when a man's wife cheats on him), and the extremes to which he goes to avoid this. He practically emprisons a girl/young woman so that she can be raised properly and will make a faithful and obedient wife when she finally matures. This of course leads him into a muddle of confusion and coincidences as everything goes wrong . . ."
5,Very Entertaining!!,"I read this play for a college comparative literature course and it was great. Moliere is extremely easy to read and his work is very enjoyable. You can't help but be astonished by Arnolphe's views of women, but his ignorance gives you a good laugh. Enjoy!!"
1,wrong color delivered-india!!!,"the belt, while nice, was the wrong color. the package said black, the pic showed black; the belt was maroon. try to get it taken care of...hah...amazon now fobs off it's customer sevice to india!!! try talking with them, try to understand them...amazon has my last dollar."
5,Divine Inspiration,"The Black Nativity is truly Gospel on Broadway--mixed with Jazz and Blues. From the mezmerizing Sweet Little Jesus Boy to the explosive Christ is Born, tThe Black Nativity is a delight for all who listen. Also, it's a great Christmas gift for those who are looking to add some soul to the Christmas music collection."
5,EXCELLENT CALIFORNIA BLUES,"I ran across this CD by accident while browsing on Amazon, after reading the reviews and hearing samples I decided to try it. First of all the sound quality is superb, his voice reminds me of Lowell Fulson very mellow, this band with him is top notch. Great guitar and piano work, all of these tunes are written by him except one is co wrote. Every song is great, not a weak one on here. I liked it so much I bought his other one,this is Blues at it's best."
1,Nothing new in this series,"Mr. Griffin has a formula. One formula, with one character and nothing changes. This book, the entire series, and in reality all of Mr Griffin's work is nothing more than the literary equivalent of marshmallow creme only with less flavor and nutritive value. I recommend it for use as a soporific or in a pinch toilet tissue."
5,beautiful music,joe satriani is a technical master on guitar hes not the best but hes definately up there what makes satriani great is he writes beautiful guitar songs that everyday people can relate to malmsteen and petrucci are great classical guitarist but not many people relate to that lifestyle joe satriani has songs about love death birth nature and simple things like a starry night (that happens to be my favorite satriani song)try this cd out its alot of thoughtful cool music that youll always remember this book im reading says the true measure of a musicians greatness is if he can give the audience goosebumps well satrianis music always does that
2,"Used to like Satch, hearing this cd, just another guitar wanker","I actually used to like Satriani and the Surfing with the Alien album alot. Listening thru this compilation though, i realize, that he puts in a good riff into each song, and a good melody line, but then it's just repeated as infinitum, i'm not getting anything from these songs except tone / atmosphere, there is no story being told like you'd hear with a Schenker (or even a Malmsteen). That's not to say i don't like instrumental albums, i do, and some fave guitarists are: Michael Schenker (acoustic and electric), Link Wray, Leo Kottke, Ynwie Malmsteen, Birelli Lagrene, Albert Lee, and Jeff Beck (during his You Had It Coming / Jeff cds period), but in reality Satriani now comes off as just another 80's guitar wanker who sounds like he's playing in his house somewhere in time to a drum machine"
2,Surfing with the Master.,"This CD is a great collection of one of Rocks best gutar players. I've been a great fan of Joe Satriani ever sence I heard ""Big Bad Moon""* (*Track eight on the C.D.)and have enjoyed many other pieces of his career."
4,A Goody No Doubt!,"All musicians should get these cds. Master Satriani is definitely one of the best guitarists ever. Some of you might not know this but Satch (not sure how he got the nick-name) was a teacher to Steve Vai. So let that tell you how good he is. Even his students come out to be incredible. My sister dosen't like alot of instrumental music, but love songs like Satch Boogie and Surfing With Alien. Get this 2cd bargain."
4,I like it!,"Pluses-Fits great.-Any part that touches the tungsten is padded.-Buttons are well protected.-Stylus, ""On"" button, IR, SDIO, Earphone plug, are with lid closed or open accessible.-Comes with a belt swivel mount +++++-PriceCon-Slippery! (It's why I gave it a 4 out of 5)-Lid makes it hard to hold handheld and type at the sametime with right thumb (only when accessing keys on the right hand side)"
1,Don't buy for Tungsten E,I bought one because was supposed to be compatible with the Tungsten E. It sits loosely in the case and will fall out easily if turned upside down. The hinge feels like it is on the wrong side and you have to remove the PDA from the case (not hard to do since it will fall out on it's own) in order to get the stylus out.
3,Great but...,"Truly a handsome aluminium case for your Tungsten, and very sturdy, but you have to take the Palm out of the case for it to fit into the HotSync cradle, which is d*** inconvenient."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"My love for the old Avon fragrance TO A WILD ROSE sent me on a hunt to find a similar fragrance since Avon no longer makes that scent. I should have known that trying to buy a fragrance online would not be as efficient as getting to sample scents as one would in a store. I also didn't want to spend a lot of money in case I didn't like the final product. I settled on this Yardley of London spray. Though it cannot hold up to Avon's TO A WILD ROSE, it still has a light and pleasant rose-like scent. Avon's was more like an actual rose. Yardley's is more artificial."
5,English Rose,I love the fragrance. It's an old time favorite that is still nice to be able to purchase. So convenient to be able to order online
3,Just so so.,The product is pretty good it just does not have the rose fragrance it used to. This product used to have a real to life rose smell.
4,Entertaining with an ironic twist,"The true western reader has to like a storyline of a ... range war to fully enjoy the paperback. However, ""hang with"" The Faro Kid, because it does have a very ironic twist to the story that makes it worthwhile the reading time."
5,Study of Scandinavian systems,Excellent coverage of a very interesting topic. Well worth spending time with and studying it more.
5,Better than CD's --,The entire Old Testament on one DVD and the entire New Testament on one more. Listen to in any order and no worry about having to change discs in the middle of a book but you can start and stop it anywhere. Narration is excellent and the NIV version easy to understand. A great way to enjoy and understand your daily Bible reading. The Bible really comes alive!
3,DVD not CD!,"This is a fine product...But in my ignorance about more modern electronics, I was reminded that a Cd is what I really needed, not a DVD. But the DVD will come in handy sometime in the future plans!"
3,"Complete, Inexpensive, Somewhat monotonous reading quality.","Complete, compact and inexpensive.Reader's tone quality is somewhat slow, flat, possibly due to high density data on discs (loss of sound quality). Also, being DVD's, these can't be played in the car stereo like CD's."
5,fast deliver and good item.,The entire Old Testament on one DVD and the entire New Testament on one more. Narration is excellent and the NIV version easy to understand. A great way to enjoy and understand your daily Bible reading. The Bible really comes alive!
1,I need to return this DVD Iwanted a CD for audio,I kneed to know how to return this .. I wanted a audio for a car not a DVD.. Please assist me so I can do a exchange ............................
2,nice but.......,"Max has a beautiful voice, hes the voice on some of my christian programs. But he's the ONLY voice. quite droll. others i have have many differnt voices for different characters. the narrator usually plays God and narrates while others play the other characters. Way more interesting! i have 2 others THE KING JAMES VERSION & THE NEW KING JAMES VERSION. bolth are far superior to this product!"
3,buying a downloadable version,This would be a five star product but I purchased it to put it on my Ipad so that I can take it when I travel and listen to it. No way to get it on my ipad. It is a mystery because I can put my movies on my ipad?
3,Navigation needs improvement,"This is a very good product in that the narrator is easily understood and and format is good. However, I bought this to use in Sunday School teaching and it has some quirks that are frustrating. It will not pause. When it is stopped then restarted, many times it skips back to the beginning of the dvd rather than resuming where it left off. I've tried it on several dvd players with same results. If the navigation errors are fixed it would be 5 star."
1,dissappointed in max,"I was extreamly staisfied with the service and time frame. i was dissappointed in the dvd itself. my Max McLean Genesis dvd shows max and i expected this to be the same. It is only his voice with the words on the screen.....such a shame, He is a excellent narrator. This dvd will not be as useful as the Genesis dvd that is have. sorry max!"
5,Holly is so hot,"This to me is Holly's best movie yet. Very edgy and cute, she's a little vixen. Can't get enough of her. Good fun flick."
5,Excellent,"For those in the U.S. who only know Nena from her 99 Luftbalon CD, this will make them stop and take notice. As with her other albums there is a great deal of meaning behind the words. I put her in the category of U2."
4,Strange title is Archive,"Ok here goes my first review.In the UK it seems that this CD is considered to be a bootleg but I can assure you it is not. It essentially also was released under the title ""Timeline"" so this review would apply to that title also although some variations in tracks and duration do exist and ""Timeline"" is more expensive.This is a live album recorded in two different locationa at two different times. The first couple of tracks of the older material are not particularly well recorded with Martin Turner's bass being overbearing. Once you get into the ""newer"" tracks the recording and balance are much better and the music really starts to motor. Wishbone Ash were always a live band and this eventualy shows up on this CD and ultimately is enjoyable. Not the best of the pack of WA live albums, ""Live in Chicago"" is better but for a WA fan go get it you won't be disappointed. Real Guitars Have Wings"
1,Worst item. Stopped working.,It became a useless piece of junk after a month of usage. I tried replacing the batteries. THe LED at the base lights but it doesnt work. This mouse SUCKS. DONT BUY IT AT ANY COST
4,Second wireless mouse,"This is my second wireless mouse ive ever had, finaly around to buying a new since my last one which was dropped to many times. Well at first it takes a little bit getting usto of, but i got the hang of it. Second, since i like to use it fast it dosnt keep up with me. Thinking that, i thought it wasnt going to work well on my games, tried it on Battlefield 2, which all that play know its an intence game and have to move around alot. Amazingly it worked find, i would say better than my previous optical cord mouse.I bought it in this color so it would match my Creative speakers, which also match my computer. Now all im waiting is for my new keyboard, since almost everything in this computer is upgraded.Only reason i didnt give it a 5 its because it dosnt have a quick enough response towards my movements. But im sure everyone is different in how they use things. Other than that, im starting to love it :D. Hopefully this little review was clear and helpful enough. Great for gamers!"
1,good for an hour,"My 3 year old son, wanted this toy for a long time. Finally santa brought it for him. He played with it for about an hour. Te net is too small, it doesn't talk all the time. Maybe a smaller child would like trying to get the ball in the net but a 3 year old gets boerd of it."
3,waste of money,"i bought this for my daughters for christmas 3 and 5. they liked the concept for about 15 minutes then they were bored. the toy falls apart all the time, the hands fall off. this toy was a bigdisappointment the ball is cute is comes with!! i do not recommend."
1,not so good,"my 3 year old loves soccer, but doesn't like this toy at all. She'd rather just kick the ball around then be bothered by this toy that shakes back and forth and makes some noise once in awhile. It is also not constructed so well, when I pick it up to move it, the top bar easily pops out"
2,Too small,"This toy was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old. It is much too small for her, even though it is labeled for 3-6 years old. W e were very disappointed in the toy, at least she has a new ball to play with."
3,"Nice, but ball is not durable","Despite the negative comments, I got this anyway so my little 2-year-old could have some exercise indoors. The goal is not too big, so it is a good size for inside the house.The ball is very cute and soft, but unfortunately, he took a bite right away out of the ball and a big chunk came out, so it is not very durable. We find that other balls work just as well.The goal is not too bad. Maybe it's a redesign, because the speaker is on top and I can hear perfectly. It's not difficult to put together, but rather fun. You have to pay attention to the shape of the connections because it's like a puzzle. If you get it right, then everything fits great.The baseboard flips up to tip the ball out. But my 2-year-old is easily distracted and isn't really shooting goals yet. I think maybe a target inside the goal would be more helpful to teach baby how to play soccer, though."
2,JUNKY TOY,I bought this for my 3yr old.Thought being she loves to play with balls.I didn't have it a day and repacked it.It falls apart when you move it or even get the ball in the goal.The goal is too small.The stickers come up or fall off.I don't believe any child should have to go through the frustration that they go through just to play a game.Every time she gets the ball in I have to put it back together for her to play again.Milton Bradley should be ashamed of them selves to put out such a terrible toy for a child. I note this as unsafe...
3,Very Disappointed!!!!!,"My son received this toy for Christmas and was very excited about it. It went together fairly easy, but after playing with it for only awhile he got bored. I tried to move it to a different location in the house and the thing fell apart. This is the most flimsy toy I have bought and I am very disappointed in the quality of it. I can never move it because I am constantly having to put it together all over again. I have thrown this toy away because I am tired of all the pieces laying around my sons room."
1,Big waste of money!,"My 4 year old got this toy for Christmas, she was so excited about getting it but when I put it together she played with it for all of an hour and it has sat in the corner untouched for the past 3 months. The goal is to small, the hands fall off of it and it just isn't much fun to play."
2,"Great concept, poor craftsmanship!","I thought this toy would make a cute gift from Santa so I added it to the pile. My 2 & 3 year old loved the whole concept but the toy is poorly constructed and constantly falling apart. I finally made it ""disappear"" and left them with the ball to play with. This toy needs to be revamped and made as one piece or better construction. Great idea but someone fell asleep during the tryout phase on this one."
1,disappointment!,Don't waste your money!! The net and other pieces never stay on -the toy is very small and not approp. for an older child. Mine were 2 and 4 when I bought it. They used it a few times and we were so tired of putting it back together we gave it away! They never really enjoyed it when it was working - don't buy!!
2,"JUST SAY NO, or don't say I didn't warn you","I read the other reviews and thought, ""Geesh, how bad can it really be?"" And then I went to the local Toys'R'Us to check it out before buying it. Looked cool. The box seemed like the goal would be of appreciable size to play with. Bought it. Brought it home. Set it up for our budding young soccer player. Wish I had taken the advice of my fellow Amazoners. We should've just said no!The goal REALLY WAS TOO SMALL after the silly face, hands & feet were attached. Ditch the goofy stuff and it could be very functional--just not silly.Pathetic durability. Don't sneeze, you may need to rebuild."
2,Very small and provides only minutes of entertainment,"My son received the Silly Soccer net as well as a plain net for his birthday at around age 2 or 3. I had wanted to keep the plain net, but I was overruled by my wife (who had purchased the Silly Soccer gift). The net worked fine and did provide some entertainment, but became useless within a year while the other net would still be in heavy use.It is very small - both the ball and the net. I would thus recommend it for people who would like to use it in tight areas. This forced my son to be more precise with his kicks, which sounds like a good thing, but wound up taking the exercise part out of the sport to be replaced instead with frustration and lack of confidence.I'm writing this review since I am now online looking for a roughly 3 feet by 4 feet net."
1,A toy to frustrate your CHILD,"With the anticipation going for my 2 year old son, he was thrilled to bring this great toy home. 5 minutes after playing with this toy and relizing the toy was to small my son was so frustrated with this toy he kicked it right in the face then kicking it till the pieces were all over the floor. Screaming,"" I don't like it."" How frustrating as a parent to buy a $20 soccor ball!!! I don't recommend this toy for any child of any age."
1,Junk,This toy was hard to put together then when it was together it fell apart and broke within 2 times of playing with it. Wouldn't recommend it.
3,"Fun For Kids, Not Adults",This toy was a bit too easy for my child. It is a lot smaller than it appears. It was a pain to assemble as well. It would be more beneficial for a family with multiple children to join in as well.
4,Best Larry Clark Movie,"A different slice of Southern California Latino culture. West coast ""Kids"" but more appealing and sympathetic characters. A bit of the movie ""The Swimmer"" too."
4,Solid and Interesting,"Directed by Larry Clark (Kids) - a relatively honest portrayal of a group of 7 latino skateboarders from south central L.A., who really just want to be left alone to skate and be kids, without the politics of the circumstances around them. They decide to go skate in Beverly Hills, where they think they will be left alone, but the harrassment and tragedy continue. Out of the original 7 kids, 2 are lost (one arrested and one shot). The kids are not actors and play themselves, which I never would have known had I not read it."
2,"oh, really bad","Anyone who would give this more than three stars either knows the director or is on drugs. This is at least in the top ten worst movies I've ever seen. And I like the director's other movies. But its a little much when he's zooming in on a young boy's butt while he's skateboarding. Its a good movie if you want to look at shirtless little boys. Anyone who grew up skating or into punk rock will find parallels to their own life here, but that doesn't make it a good movie. All of the guys are very dull. The plot is poorly executed. And I guess the movie tries to make some point about class struggle??? Overall, it's just a dumb movie. I doubt this guy's movies make money anymore... so he must be rich or just know people. He is probably the guy who fell down the stairs in the Beverly Hills Mansion (For those who've struggled through actually seeing the film). Don't waste your time."
2,"Good idea, bad acting","I like Larry Clark's idea and the story line, but it was painful to watch these kids ""act""."
4,Another great read,"Reading this book started me on the search for others like it. Recently, I read Sailing Ships of New England by George Francis Dow, another famous boat builder. If you're interested in this sort of thing, I highly recommend it. It's full of great illustrations and makes for a great follow-up to Around Cape Horn."
4,A lovely collection of photos,"I was looking for a book with photos of the Monterey Peninsula, as I am considering relocation to the area and wanted to know what the peninsula looks like. This book provides a good variety of lovely aerial views that show off the region and essentially met my expectations. (I actually hope the photos don't do the area justice!) The photo captions provide some history of the features in the photographs, but I would prefer more description of all the things I'm seeing. Although, that would mean less room for the pictures! My only real beef with the book is a lack of a table of contents, which would make flipping to the right section/region easier."
1,Smells,"This product is poisonous. I can say that is not true for all of them, my friend bought the same mat, and it was OK. My theory is that someone returned the mat, and they spray it with poison for re-sale. Anyways, my mat smells so bad, it stunk up a 2000 sq ft yoga room, and I had to leave. The poison foamed up when I swet onto it. This is very different from the rubbery smell that is normal.Don't buy it! It could poison you!"
2,there is such a thing as too sticky,"This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful."
4,Good Beginner's Mat,I wanted my own mat because I was getting sick from using my studio's mats. This mat was the right price for how I was going to use it and I was pleasantly surprised at its thickness -- not too thick that I'm unstable on balance poses yet thick enough to provide cushion for my knees. This is a good mat that serves its purposes well for beginner or intermediate yogis. The traction/stickness is built up over time so beware of the first uses that feet and hands can slip some.
4,Beutiful DVD,I recomend this artist to all the people how likes this kind of history!!Yoram Gaon genius!!!We loved very much!
4,"Sugar, spice, and all that's nice","I first watched this movie with my clas in third grade , and it touched me immeasuably. It is a sweet and simple movie with themes that all of us would do good to take to heart."
4,Right On Time,"I saw this movie one Sunday in my teenage years when I was feeling rather depressed. I think I was bored and maybe a little lonely this summer. I had shut myself in my room where no one could bother me and was just crying for whatever reason. This movie came on and at first I was taken my the story of a young girl setting out to make her dreams come true. Then, there's the romantic aspect that young girls (heck, even women) always get a kick out of. But more importantly, through tragedy Sonora's determination may only became stronger. This movie is right up there with movies like ""Ice Castles"" and ""Other Side of the Mountain"" that show me everytime I watch them on tape or on TV that life's possibilities really are endless."
5,never saw it before,I really liked the movie. I bought it for my sister. It was a Christmas present. She was really happy.
1,Love the movie---bummed that this item was incorrect for my dvd player,"Ok, I admit---it may have been my error, but if you are advertising something that is only compatible for players in certain areas of the world. You shouldn't leave this information to just the normal amazon seller settings. I would put this in bold, big letters in other areas of the product description."
3,COULD NOT PLAY THE DVD,This DVD is a region 2 DVD. I am not able to watch this on my player. I tried another player and it would not play. I didn't realize DVD's have different regions. Not the seller's fault. Came quickly and brand new!!!
5,Wild Hearts Can't Be Tamed review,I have loved this movie ever since I was a little girl and was so glad to see that it was on DVD!
5,Great horse movie!,I have owned this on VHS since I was little and finally bought the dvd. My best friend and I watched this all the time! Great inspirational horse movie!
5,Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,Wild Hearts Can't Be BrokenThis DVD is an excellend portrayal and an inspiring story of a young woman's determination and courage in the face of adversity. Excellent acting. Great for the whole family.
4,Wild hearts cant keep me away from this movie!,Wild hearts cant be broken is about a young girl (Sonora) who sees an ad in a newspaper just before she is thrown out of her aunt's house. Homeless Sonora decides to answer the ad for a diving girl. The man that put out the ad (Mr. Carver) doesnt see Sonora as what he is looking for. After much persuasion Sonora gets a job as a stable girl for him. Then Sonora....well I cant tell you what happens. Buy this video and find out the sweet ending to this fabulous movie!!
5,Great movie!,My family loved this movie. Couldn't find the dvd in any stores. I should have started with Amazon.com. I'll know better next time!
5,Very inspiring,Good movie with a plot that brings thoughts of romance and matters of the heart. give it a try you may enjoy.
3,Movie good - packaging NOT,The product arrived is less than satifactory condition. One of the clips that keep the disc in place was broke and the disc was moving all around in its case. So it could be scratched because of this and it also make storage a problem too as everytime you pick the case up the disc is moving around in the case.Yuck!This is a disney movie and the other movie I bought from Amazon that arrived in the same shape was a disney movie. So is the material they package up their movies with infieror. I've no problem with other cases being shipped that arrived broken.
4,Nice Lead Actress & Inspiring Story,"My VHS copy is so good of this I never got around to buying the DVD, but I will because it's worth it.That's because this a nice, old-fashioned film and Gabrielle Anwar as ""Sonora Webster"" was a pleasure to watch. I'm sorry she never developed into a major star, although she's stayed busy in her acting career.This is a based-on-a true story and if a woman really performed diving horse acts while blind, well, that IS incredible. It makes this film certainly an inspiring story.I enjoyed looking at the recreation of the Atlantic City Boardwalk during its heyday. Overall, the colors could have been better in this film, however. There was too much brown, but it's not a major problem.The story is the man thing here and in that aspect, it's a winner."
1,Not enough warning,"I purchased two of these movies from 2 different vendors and neither worked. I have never heard of different zones for DVDs and I think you should find a much more explicit way of warning Americans if they are buying from other zones. It is a fantastic movie that I can't watch. If there was a warning on the original purchase, I certainly did not see it,"
1,Dvd,I was really ecited to watch this but it is made for a different region so I am unable to play it on any of my devices. So disappointed!
1,Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,"I purchased this for my four year old granddaughter's birthday. She was very excited, since her old VHS finally broke. We have tried playing it on three different DVD players, and there is nothing on the DVD. She is heartbroken, and I am angry."
1,Wrong DVD,I love this movie but was sent a dvd that we could not view. the seller wrote back that he does have another that I may purchase. I like the fact that he wrote back. My money was refunded back to my account.
3,Classic,This is just another disney classic remembered from years long ago. True story of a girl's fight to find her way in left and her battle to overcome her blindness. What can i say its like every other disney movie from the era.
1,Animal Abuse,I have never seen this movie but am going to rent it soon. Sadly enough i have read that horses jumping in tanks of water from 40 foot above is something that did actually happen and that this movie was made recently after it ended. Disney supported in other words the abuse of animals and injury inflicted upon both animals and humans alike. There was supposedly a horse that an owner of a diving horse took to jump into the ocean instead of a pool. This horse looked toward shore but instead went to the sea instead of land.People went out in boats to get but it just turned it head took one last look at the sea and ducked its head into the water for good rather than to go back to the abusive job it had before and the tormenting it faced
5,Re:Animal abuse,"Personally I dont like animal abuse myself. Nor the lack of appreciation for great movies. This is a great movie. All tho it is based on a true story I am sure that animals were not injured during the making of this movie. As far as the past, it is something no one can change. The movie shows what happens when you believe in yourself and follow your dreams. And yes I am sure that when this stuff was really happening that horses and riders were injured. But like I said before you cannot change that. You should not say that Disney promotes animal abuse because we all know different. I don't recall ever seeing a Disney film I didn't like.Currently horses are being slaughtered for Meat in foreign countries... don't you think that is animal abuse??Further more there is absolutley nothing that should prevent you from watching or buying this movie. It IS a great movie"
1,WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!,"I guess I really should be saying thanks to Disney for saving me money this month by not having to buy a movie I was so excited for instead of complaining, but its just so disappointing. Why can all of the recent crap that's been in movie theaters and on TV get decent DVD releases, but when it comes time to put a classic-type film out for the general public that Disney has the intelligence of one its most beloved characters - Dopey! Can anyone give me a reason - even a bad one - why this wasn't at least released in both widescreen (as it was made and shown in theatrically) as well as the inferior full screen. I have a Hi-Def 16x9 television and movies released in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio certainly don't fill up my screen. So disappointing, but hey, at least I saved myself 15 bucks this month."
1,DVD does not work,"Received the DVD in a decent amount of time. It was wrapped and appeared to be new, but when I put it in my DVD player all I received was an error message. I put other DVDs in my DVD player and they worked just fine so it appears to be a problem only with this DVD."
5,Real customer service!!,The first shipment was evidently lost in the mail -- I was delighted that a second movie was shipped immediatley with no questions asked. A great experience in customer relations!
5,Why so long in arriving?,"I have watched this movie since it came out in '91. It is by far one of the best movies I have watched and I have seen many. My guess is it wasn't very popular, but there are many movies that haven't been popular, but still good, namely Home Fries. Excellent film also.You won't be disappointed with this movie. It takes place during the great depression and chooses to show the struggle of a young woman who is fighting all odds to show that she can make it."
5,An Old Favorite On A New-ish Medium,"I used to love watching this movie on television or renting it on VHS as a kid, and I couldn't have been more pleased to finally find this to purchase! I hadn't seen this movie in years, and it was even better as an adult.My husband- not your chick-flick type- really enjoyed it, too. It has just enough romance and strong female characters to keep the love-bird types interested, with enough horses, manly-men and Old West charm to keep the tough ones from labeling it a ""chick flick"". I loved it as a kid because of the tough girl and horses, and someone not much older than myself living out her dreams.All in all, a definite must-see and must-have for any household, in my humble opinion."
5,WILD HEARTS CAN'T BE BROKEN,My granddaughter has watchED WILD HEARTS CAN'T BE BROKEN over and over - she (and I) love it. Great horse and love story.
1,Get the Real Thing Instead!,"This is NOT related to the Ancient Aliens TV series, and this is NOT good! It offers nothing new. Get the Ancient Aliens TV series on DVD's (or stream it) and watch all of the newer episodes on the History Channel. It's one of the best shows on TV and will give you WAY more interesting and entertaining information about ancient alien theory!"
3,Compelling evidence,"Philip Coppens takes us through the evidence of previous alien visitations. From the pyramids, both in Egypt and in the Americas, to formations on the ground that can only be seen from the air, there's plenty to wonder about here. Add to that the worldwide myths, which feature visitors of similar description, and it's all very compelling. Just the technology of moving large stones seems impossible without outside help, since this technical capability has only been possible recently with large machines. In particular I was fascinated by the Crystal Skull story, which I'd never heard before and early evidence of a nuclear blast in the middle of the Sinai Desert. It's a straight-forward presentation, nothing fancy, and much of the visual material is nicely presented. If you find this sort of thing sparks your imagination, you're in for a treat."
2,interesting,"okay needed more punch about ancient aliens not enough visual graphics, reinactments, or demos to much narrations it could use actual locations for interest."
3,Spelling out the facts,"The truth about the pyramids, Nazca Lines, Crystal skulls...all of the evidence is compiled here. It is a good outline of all kinds of topics that cannot be explained away by modern science."
1,False Advertising!,Do not purchase from Viking Gear a.k.a. Salicor Inc. The item I received is not at all like the picture. Do not be fooled. It does not match the Target exclusive versions. The only reason I purchased this item is because I thought it would match my collection but it does not. Returned.
1,Rip off,"I will never again buy a movie download from Amazon - every one I have is ""currently unavailable"" and has been for months! So, even though I bought and PAID for them, I can't get them to play, nor will they give me my money back.RIP OFF."
4,DVD not as good as Blu-Ray,The movie was very good. But I wish the DVD had all the feature that the Blu-Ray did. I don't have the money for a Blu-Ray player and would like to enjoy all the special features as well.
5,AMAZING!!,Harry Potter is awesome! This movie is spell bounding! I have seen it 3 times and notice something new each time. This film is much darker than the previous movies. It absolutely answers questions one may have regarding the story. A must see for any Harry Potter fan!
1,Read the captions and stare at a black screen,This movie is so dark that you spend the majority of the time reading the captions and staring at a black screen. WB needs to make quality DVDs instead of this junk. I can't rate the movie because I couldn't see it.
2,Do not waste your money,"The lighting levels in virtually every scene are so dim that you would be far better off to simply re-read the book. Paying to look at a video that consists of a totally black screen for two thirds of a 2 1/2 run time is utterly ridiculous.I am ticked off at this. (Seriously -- I am a huge fan of the series and all of these actors and whoever shot this movie ought to be ashamed of themselves. Whoever is responsible for this, at best, has a great future in radio.)"
1,What happened to the Harry Potter film genre,"Just wanted to express my utter displeasure for what seems an unfortunate change in the Harry Potter film genre.From magical delightful escape, we are now presented with a harsh monotonous slow story which bores and shocks. What a great pity."
1,Poor Instant Rental,"This is not a poor review of the movie, but of the instant rental service. You get 2 days to watch the movie that you rent, but I could not watch it on the night that I rented it. Not because of my connection, but because of some problem with the amazon.com server. I am very disappointed and this experience has probably ended my instant rentals for good from amazon.com."
1,Surprised,"I recently paid to watch it in my hotel room and could not watch it to the end, very dark and boring. I suppose I should not be surprised, since I could not finish the last HP book either, but I was hoping for something better.Some of the reviews here seem to be quite favourable, so maybe it's me, but I won't be watching PT 2.All in all a good series, just a shame they could not finish it off well"
3,March of the Potters (Penguins/Potters/Penguins),"This movie reminded me of March of the Penguins. We watch the trio of kids traipse all around England like the penguins marched around Antarctica in MotP, and the pacing of the movies was eerily similar. Just as an occasional polar bear-ish siting would happen to liven things up in MotP, there is an occasional villain popping up in this movie to liven things up. Both movies also lack a driving narrative. In MotP, the penguins just go back and forth because that's what they do. Here, the trio look for horacruxes because...well, because...well, because they have to!It was nice to look at, the acting is fine, and I am eager for Part 7. I'm hoping Part 7 delivers all of the excitement that this movie was missing."
3,worse Harry Potter to date,Slow and at times boring. I think WB's attempt to milk the cow by splitting final chapter into part 1 and 2 added much slow and uneventful scenes.
1,Trashed this DVD,"I watched this and immediately threw it into the trash - it was horrible. No magic, No Hogwarts, just a lot of loud sounds and real junk - don't waste your money."
3,A Second Chance,"Many people deserve second chances, I guess movies are the same. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and fell asleep whilst watching it. Reading the book I really didn't build my hopes up, having already done that with 'Watchmen' which was disappointing. However this is a new year, and just recently seeing all six parts of the movies, I feel compelled to review this movie. It is a journey movie, and the locales of the movie are extraordinary. The actors are getting better in their performance, and throwing in Bill Nighy made the movie just a bit better. Voldemort in my opinion is not terrific cinematic villain (He's no Darth Vader or Heath Ledger's Joker)he's at best a villain worthy of showtunery. Nevertheless I found this movie to be quite a treat. Note to others I was sleeping off and on. I am eagerly anticipating Deathly Hallows pt. 2."
4,Harry Potter,"Harry Potter movie 7 is one intense movie in the sense of dark magical ways. However the scenes were draggy, the conclusion for the movie will blow your mind :P"
4,No Slip Cover,"Well, I guess I waited too long to pick this title up. None of the local big box stores had the Blu-ray release with a slip cover either. Took a chance on amazon.com still having stock, but it seems they do not. The release I received does have the 3 discs, just no slip cover. However, at only 10 bucks, I can live with it until the super-ultra-cool-complete 8 movie set is released sometime in 2012..."
2,"Not very interesting, hard to follow","The entire family fell asleep through this boring movie. Some special effects were good. The story was very hard to follow. I think the die hard Potter fans will say it is great, but if you are just watching a movie, choose another. The first few movies in the series were entertaining however."
1,No Digital Copy!,"Buyer Beware! This boxed set does NOT come with a valid digital copy, even though the product picture says it does and the product description said it came with it when I bought it -- ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo + Digital Copy)"". There was nothing in the product description indicating that the digital copy had expired over a month before I purchased this."
1,Digital Copy - EXPIRED!,"Well, I just spent a few extra bucks to get this movie with the digital copy. It EXPIRED! Warner Brothers says that it clearly states that it expires September 13, 2011. By clearly they mean once you have already bought it, opened it up, it is printed in small print INSIDE the packaging where you would activate the digital copy. How dumb of me to not know this when ordering on-line. Even if you bought in personyou would have to open the case up to see this. Something that gets you arrested if you don't buy it first...Well at least other movie studios like Disney actually try to take care of their customers and offer real digital copies and not misleading lies on the front cover."
4,Awesome film...,"i like it because it's a rare edition and i think it was worth buying it for those who got it while supplies lasted at Walmart. not a lot of people can say they have this edition. well long story short, it's a great edition however it doesn't contain a spanish audio track. for those of you who are looking forward to watching this movie in spanish, i don't recommend it, however it does have spanish subtitles. although, i don't think that would be enough considering the price of this edition. Disc one only contains the film, scene and language selections, and disc two contains special features."
3,Annoying ads.,"To begin with, settling down to watch this film, I began to think there had been a mistake. Did they really have to put fifteen minutes of ads for various stupid video games first? There's even a Lego Harry Potter game! I was wondering how much it woukld cost to return the thing from Australia before I finally found 'Chapter 7' which seemed to be the actual film.Next time, manufacturer, just give me the film.The film was OK, but only OK. I'll still buy the finale of course. For a long-time Harry Potter fan, it's obligatory."
3,"dvd quality bad, but great film","I got this in the mail the afternoon of April 14th. I was so excited to have gotten it early, I rushed home to watch it. I was incredibly mad, however, at the quality and packaging of the film. On the plastic covering, it said that the DVD was made in Mexico. And the quality sucked. It was not clear and was slightly pixilated at certain points. The movie itself is amazing, just not the DVD. Plus, it only had 5 deleted scenes, and no other special features! That was dissapointing. It had:15. The Dursley House16. Dudley and Harry83. Ministry of Magic Lifts89. Tentand108. Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones"
1,Poor quality DVD,"This is the worst-quality DVD I've ever purchased. The color quality is awful, the skin tones are waxy and the animated scenes are pixel-ated. It was a great movie in the theater, but don't waste your money on this DVD."
2,"Worst of the Potter Films, by far","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is the worst of the Potter films, by far. The story is meandering and pointless, the look of the film is dreary, and the acting not especially good. Admittedly, the movie attempts to recreate a very large book, showing only the first half of the book in this film, which is a big part of the problem - the movie has no ending, no climax, no closure, and no point. Perhaps Part 2 will be better, but my advice is to read the books and skip the films, which are just a feeble reflection of the stories."
2,Terrible Picture Quality/Mixing,The Digital Copy is practically unwatchable with all the macroblocking. The voices are totally lost in the mix so you'll deafen yourself turning the volume up to hear it. The DVD is no better. I seriously can't believe that WB felt like this was an appropriate way to handle their cash cow.
3,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I,This DVD is too dark. More than 50% of the picture/movie/DVD are dark scenes and you can not make-out the picture/s. Sound is OK but the video/picture is bad.Again - it is too dark of a DVD to see/enjoy. If you enjoy watching a black screen/TV No picture) - this is the DVD.
2,Harry Potter and the deathly hallows,all the goods i brought arrived nicely packed and I love it!however for this deathly hallows part 1 there are some issue while watching.the sound or vol has some problem. some scene has sound while some scene doesn't have as if i have mute it. some scene the sound suddenly became very soft and the next scene become very loud. so i would consider this DVD as spoiled. Thanks
2,Great movie; terrible streaming quality from amazon.,"I really loved the movie, but the Amazon streaming quality was poor on both the roku player and the computer."
4,Mostly well done,"I'm a bit of a purist, and we are impossible to please for the most part. I liked the fact that the movie tried very hard to stick to the main important plot elements of the story, but because this is a book (a LONG book) turned into a movie, they had to rush the plot in order to fit things in, and this was worsened by the addition of a completely STUPID scene of Harry and Hermione dancing to the radio after Ron's desertion. Completely pointless, and the time they wasted on it could have been put to sooo much better use - expanding on the story of Regulus Black, for example. Ah well. Waiting for the next one, now..."
2,Quality Dissatisfaction,"I waited a long time for this DVD to be released. I even pre-ordered. Unfortunately, the quality of the disc I received leaves much to be desired. The quality is so dark I have to completely blacken the room (never watch during the day) in order to make out what is on screen. The first time I watched it, I found myself having to remember snatches from the book in order to know what was going on on screen. The video was so dark I could hear voices, but not make out the action.I may have to re-purchase from some other source."
5,great,I plan to purchase the entire series on bluRay. . My wife even loved it and she's not one to watch many movies
2,A huge letdown: the film was as bad as the books.,"Tedious, boring, I didn't finish watching this movie. I don't like the books either.It's not as good as Tolkein (The Hobbit).I sm 75 years old."
4,Good Book!,This is a good book also but enjoyed The Divine Beauty by Evan Stalter more.Harry Potter sends adventure in different ways.Always
2,Dark,"It was hard to sit through this movie as the screen was always so dark, much more than the others in this set. Also, the ending is rather abrupt, the movie does not stand alone."
3,"good movie, terrible transfer","I and my family just finished watching the latest HP movie. The movie itself is very good. However we must warn others that transfer is absolutely terrible, with several scenes unwatchable due to screen being completely black. We are quite disappointed that Amazon would sell this product at all, much less at a premium price. I am assuming the copy Amazon sells is the same software as what is found on a DVD, so the problem would likely be found on the discs as well."
5,Riveting stuff,Perhaps the best one yet (apart from the first one). Once again need to have read the book first as there is so much more in that and it would be easy to get confused if you didn't know the why's and wherefors.
5,This ain't Hogwarts anymore,"I will say this - the Harry Potter series is getting darker and better as it progresses. I like David Yates' innovative camera angles and pacing - they really do set the mood for the film and make it quite chilling. The animated sequence illustrating the Death Hallows was beautiful. The campsite locations were all exotic and evoked the landscapes of the Lord of the Rings. I was actually surprised that we don't see Hogwarts at all (except for a brief cameo).Unfortunately, there were a few bad influences fromTwilight, particularly a vision of Harry and Hermione making out. These were usually minimal, but still stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, if you haven't read the books, some scenes will seem pointless or extraneous.Probably the best part about this movie was the ending and how it sets up for the grand finale. I won't spoil the ending, but I think Yates chose a perfect spot to split the final book in half."
1,Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1,"The movie was fine but the product overall was disappointing. I preordered this movie but others had this movie ( that went out and bought) days before I received mine. The price of my preordered movie offset this somewhat, but not enough for the enjoyment and the excitement of the kids who's friends already had and watched. There is more but discussion with Amazon on other issues was taken care of satisfactorily."
2,I HAVE RARELY SEEN SUCH A SLOW MOVING MOVIE,"OMG!!! I was pulling my hair off..the begging was puerile, the middle slow and the end...well the end was a little more interestingWatch it in streaming and the streaming was good.Unfortunately unlike other supporters around here...what a bore.And I have read the book as well...an identical bore."
3,Good Service/ So So movie,The service was great. I got the movie sooner than expected and it was in great condition. My only complaint was that the movie wasnt that good for a Harry Potter movie.
2,"Love Harry Potter, not this movie","As the books get progressively longer the movies started to leave more and more out of the films (understandable the first book is so short compared to the later ones). I love Harry Potter, have all the books and extras and movies up until this one. This is one I felt the flow of the movie was slow and dull. Sure, we watch it because we love the books and characters and yes I will see part II for the same reason, but this movie is not well done. I often wanted to give a pat on the fast forward to speed things up when normally I want to slow the movie down and make it last longer. Even though the movie is week, it doesn't diminish the quality of the books and story."
5,"Great Movie, High Quality Blu-ray","If you like the increasingly dark direction the series has been taking you'll definitely enjoy the latest installment. The Blu-ray transfer looks and sounds great. The digital copy will expire at some point, so if thats important to you make sure to pick it up soon."
4,Potter Review,"It's a DVD. It played. Good enough for me.As for the movie itself, no comment. My wife's the Harry Potter fan."
5,Lightned up my day.,Arrived on time. And was reasonably priced. Works excellently. I recommend this item to people are Harry Potter Fans. Thanks for you excellent service.
3,Thru a pair of lens darkly,I have read and enjoyed all the Potter books. I appreciate the way that Rowling's had the People grow and mature..I never thought that the films followed the Books that closely..something with the same genesis but a different Exdos.The latter films are very dark.. both in theme/ execution and in presentation.. i had to turn off the lights and cover over the on light on my player to see some of the scenes!!It is hard of not impossible to translate some things from books to film.. but given that the film maker do a good job of presenting a watchable and entertaining film.
3,Poor Quality,It was definitely a mistake to get the non-HD version of this movie. The movie was pretty good but the quality of the video was horrible. Go HD or consider another option if downloading this.
4,Good translation to 3D but not great,"As with other movies I've seen converted to 3D, it is just not as good as one made for 3D. The scenes did show some depth, but the action parts that should come out of the screen at you didn't as much as they should.Made for 3D movies are much better."
5,Very pleased,"Doby is terrific. A little larger than I expected and very well done. He sat on my desk for a while and made me smile. He is now settled in on the mantel along with the loot I brought back from Harry Potter World in Orlando.The film was a wonderful surprise as I didn't get to see it in the theater. The director/screen writer did not add anything to the story to boost his ego and managed to insert important details left out of previous films to make the story hang together. Was the best film version of the books since the first 2 movies.For some reason, film makers still insist on equating dark deeds with a dark screen so parts are difficult to make out but it's not as bad as I feared.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with both Dobby and the film and feel I got good value for my money."
2,Special Features on Blu-Ray disk only,"I ordered this 3-disk set just so I would receive the special features disk. To my disappointment, the special features were Blu-Ray format only. I paid extra, thinking that two of the disks would be DVDs with the Blu-Ray movie on the 3rd. It would have been helpful if the product description had made this clear. And, after downloading the digital copy for hours, it would not play on my ZEN. All in all, I would have been better off just renting Deathly Hallows from Amazon and watching it on ROKU. As to the movie, I loved it because of its faithfulness to the book and the impressive acting of the main trio, who have grown brautifully into their roles."
1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows,"The voices are completely out of sync with the pictures-in other words, the characters are speaking when the pictures shows no lip movement. How do I return this item. Someone didn't check the quality of this movie. I need my money back too. Must I spend money to get it back to you??Thank you.Marilyn Martin."
3,Not the Best Harry,"I have all the Harry Potter films and this is by far the least understanable of his movies. The plot was hard to follow and it didn't ""connect all the dots"". I hope all the questions that it left me asking will be answered in Part Two. I like to see a movie with a plot I can understand from beginning to end with no added emblishments (computer added backgrounds), like this one. This is more of a movie for the younger, computer graphics fan."
2,Harry Potter Blue Ray Disk,"Two of the worst Blue Ray disk I have ever bought! The voice sync was so bad on both disk you gave up trying to watch it. I sent the first one back and received a replacement, but it was worst than the first one. The plain DVD disk was great and the special was ok. I didn't return second disk, to much of a hassle for me. Enjoyed DVD movie though. Will not preorder again, I will wait and order later."
2,Upset,"When I purchased the three disc set of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1, I was looking forward to down loading the digital copy of the movie, When I down loaded the movie, Warner Bros.(WB) only gave me 50% of the movie for my personnel computer. I tried to contact WB about the problem and have yet to hear from them. I will not be purchasing any three disc movies set in the future. I would be wasting my money.angry and upset"
3,Yates Again,"Usually I enjoy David Yates films and expected this newer installment to be better but I found that it was both enjoyable and boring at the same time.I have no beef with the actors, just David. Why in heavens name would he be attached to this final story? I thought that the Order of the Phoenix could have been so much better in the long run.R.W Todd -author of The Madness of Avlon Klynn"
5,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, pt. 1","Did not like the dialog printed at bottom of screen during the movie. Movie was good though, had to watch it twice..."
5,A good way to start the end...,"So as you all know, this is Part 1 of the last Harry Potter movie/book. Them deciding to split the final movie into 2 parts was a good move on their part. This way they can include everything from the last book and make it into a fitting end to one of the greatest franchises that we've seen in awhile. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 picks up where the Half Blood Prince leaves off and starts off with alot of action. The characters we've grown with through each and every single movie have grown up as well. We learn in this movie how much they think of each other and how much their lives intertwine with everything in the world of Harry Potter. It is a great adventure and after seeing it you will be waiting on the edge of your seat for Part 2 in July."
3,Really?,"Another Harry Potter movie where a very limited amount of stuff happens. Good lord, is this supposed to be a MINI SERIES you watch as you grow old and die?Beautiful film visually, as always, but I really think the plot of these things DRAAAAAAAGS. Sorry, but that's my two cents. You can leave it in the leave a penny take a penny jar if you like."
5,Woooooo,"Excelente película, la imagen y el sonido perfectos, yo soy fanático de Harry Potter, muy cumplidos con el envió salio al día siguiente de la compra"
4,a great culmination of the characters,i almost expected a lot of the dull plot twists - but it was still fun to watch. if you've seen all the other movies you can't miss the Deathly Hallows..
5,A must for the Harry Potter fan,"This, along with part II, finishes off the Harry Potter story. Alone, it seems a bit of a bore, but combined with part II, it fits nicely into the story. You definitely need both parts of the Deathly Hallows if you want to find out how the film version turns out as they contain twists that turn the story on its head."
2,DVD watcher,"I love all of the Harry Potter books and movies. However, this is the worst one, mainly because it looks like most of it was filmed in the dark and it is very difficult to see the action going on through most of the film. You can still have dark overtones and still have a few lights on so you can see what's going on. Don't these directors review them before they say ""print""? What's the point of filming a movie when it looks like it's almost entirely in the dark? They also changed quite a few things from the book. This was a very disappointing Harry Potter movie."
2,Like Twilight without the pseudo sexiness,"I thought why not continue the series, and tried. Having loved the first film after I read the book, I thought--what fun. And it was. But by now the fun is gone and the predictability is the storyline. Thank heavens for DVD technology so you can zoom past the long, dull scenes...to cut to the limited storyline. I know I'm one of the few, who wasn't happy with it. But such is life. Boring."
5,dvd,as with all harry potter dvd's this was the final and the best and pulled the whole story together and will be viewed several times
1,TERRIBLE 3D,"Dont waste your money on this blu ray. Saw part 2 in imax 3d and it was pretty good, so when i got my new 3d tv i had to buy it. Decided to buy part 1 as well, big mistake. Total waste of money, I already own it on blu ray and will probably never watch the 3d version again. If you dont own the blu ray already you might consider buying just to have it, but compared to part 2 the 3d is horrible."
1,Oh My God,"AWFUL, Oh my God, don't rent or buy it. Dreary, not even drama in dialogue. Put me to sleep when I closed my eyes to avoid the low lighting through the whole movie."
2,Extremely disappointing,"Poor visual quality, poor sound quality, poorly done story line. Film was viewed on a large screen LED TV, no problem with my equipment. Harry's shot his load, time to let him fade away into the bland English countryside."
1,One of Worst Movies I have ever seen,"I rarely write a DVD review, but I cannot help but tell people to save your money and not but this loser. The numerous 5-15 minute conversations that said nothing; the reminiscing about how mom and dad died which they have touched on before many times; the break-out into a teen love story; the dance sceen between Harry and Hamiani at a most inopportune time; Harry going diving with his glasses on; but it was so obvious that the producers were trying to drag Part 1 out so they could cash-in on a Part 2. I usually find the Harry Potter movies entertaining, but this one was a real bore! $3.00 for this dog is about right; remember, you get what you pay for."
1,Harry Potter Deathly Hallow,Video quality on 2 copies I purchased was lousy. I like the movie but picture was blurred with both copies at the second half of the movie.I need to wait for a new release and hope for better reproduction quality
5,Harry Pooter and the Deathly Hallows Blu-Ray/DVD Combo,"Another great Harry Potter move. I can't wait for part 2. Great packaging with DVD, Blu-Ray, and instructions to download a digital copy of PC or iPad."
3,good movie- ?,"I really enjoyed this Dark episode of this amazing series- my only constructive criticism is that the Movies disc seemed to be over compressed -and the disc its stored on cannot handle it well - would of been better to divide the movie and print it on two disc's - not a clean copy- very disapointed in the disc manufacturer .i do not own a blue ray player and am waiting for their prices to come down and work better , wish i could of gotten a blueray copy -would of been better -maybe ? ( not every bluray player will play all DVD. disc's - reguardles of what they say ) overall- good movie/Bad copy"
3,Don't think much,"I don't think much of this movie. I liked the other ones in the series. But, this one, not so much. There is more fighting in this movie than in the book. They didn't stay as close to the book as in the other movies. The others weren't EXACTLY like the books. But, they didn't have fights just to be having fights. I will get the last one, when it becomes available on DVD, just to have the whole set."
2,Not My Cuppa Tea,"I really, really enjoyed the earlier movie versions of Harry Potter but this one wasn't my cuppa tea. The earlier ones seemed to be ""action pack"" from start to finish while I found myself going to the refrigerator a lot with ""Deathly Hallows."" Just wanted it as an addition to my collections. Not one to watch more than twice."
2,most disappointed,The DVD quality is very poor .It's been a complete waste of money and I am regretting the fact that I bought the other Harry Potter movies without first checking the quality.
3,fine,This dvd tends to skip in the same spots of the movie each time I have watched it. I don't think you should sell movies that skip.
3,harry potter deathly hallows,i think the kids did an excelent job growing up with the books as always the stuff left out was sorely missed and the changes were plentythe dragon scene was entertaining once again the changes were dissappointing
3,Digital Copy,"Digital copy did not work. It offered a software ""update"" and disappeared. Next time I ran it, there were no choices left. Digital copy has always sucked. Why can't they get it right? The movie was very good. Nice quality on Blu-ray. If you are thinking of shelling out for the 3-disc set, the DVD version also comes with it. This makes the Digital Copy even more worthless.The special features disc is Blu-ray, however is a major disappointment. It is not labled at all. I tried it in different players before I discovered it was Blu-ray. There is only about one-half hour of extras on this disc. There are no extras on the DVD. Very sad indeed."
4,Harry Potter 7,"Maybe, because I know something about how books are adapted to folm, I'm more tolerant of what was left out. You simply can not show how long Harry stayed at Grimvauld Place or the forrest of Dean, it would turn the film into a 4 very boring 4 hours. It is very fast moving film with of course a lot of action. The only bad thing I can say against it is that it shot in the dark. You have to watch it in dark."
2,harry potter and the deathly hollows part 1,"I'm a big harry potter fan, I went to go see the movie in the theater and I loved it. I could not wait to purchase it on dvd. But to my surprise it was not the same movie I saw in the theater, they cut out so much of the movie I thought I was seeing things. I said this can't be possible. I know what I saw at the movies and why would they do this!. I am so sadden by this that I hope they make a correction. So disappointed!."
3,Set Up,"If you are going to watch part one, you need to rent or buy part two at the same time, I think it's wrong to make a two parter and leave it as it did in part one, but as we can tell the writers just made this slow moving thing to get kids to pay to watch part two. I can't believe I paid real money to watch this crap."
3,Satisfied for the most part.,"I loved the great deal on the movie; I wouldn't of found that anywhere else! The only thing that I didn't like was when I got the DVD, there was a hole punched in the paper covering... other than that I'm happy."
5,A Harry Potter Movie: What else is there to say?,A Harry Potter Movie: What else is there to say? It's an amazing movie... enough said. You won't regret buying this.
5,Tweety,It is a good bargain and will watch the movie during the Xmas holiday during a break. Supposed to be a Christmas present. Guess what? Hubby found it and what is it doing tthere. He want to watch it and told him - wait for after Christmas Day!Merry Christmas!!
4,HP Part 1 -,"I have to be honest, this wasn't my favorite part of the books, so I knew this wouldn't be my favorite movie. You have to see it if you are an avid Harry fan because it is part of the whole series that makes these books so wonderful. It does remind me why I don't like the Lord of the Rings especially the first movie because they are doing a lot of running to something but they aren't sure what it is or how they are going to get there."
2,4 stars for the movie - 2 stars for this release = 2 stars total,"While this is an excellent adaptation of the first 24 chapters or so of J.K. Rowling's book, the initial Harry Potter home video releases continue to disappoint with their stunningly skimpy bonus materials and lack of documentaries. It's obvious that this film, including its current special features, will be released eventually as: 1. An ""Ultimate Edition"" with new special features, 2. In a ""Complete Movie Collection"" with all the other films, and 3. Possibly as an ""Extended Edition"" combined with Part 2. So why in the world would I be foolish enough to pay $15-25 for this now? If you're a die-hard fan who just can't wait to have this, I suppose I understand, but you should just rent it and save your money for later. Otherwise, this is a blatant attempt by Warner Bros. to continually screw people out of their money. And that's not cool with me."
2,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.ONLY 2 out of screen effects extend 5% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. Other than that, there were about 9 more effects at LESS than 5%.The quality of the in screen 3D is about the same as watching a 2D version and just letting your TV do the conversion to 3D. Even among the post-production (FAKE) 3D films, this one ranks below average.MY 3D RATING = FAIR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
4,Deathly Hallows length dilemma,I have seing all Harry Potter movies. I like this one but there is a part that it becomes very slow and almost boring. I think the problem is that the Deathly Hallow story takes at least 3 hours so they add long scenes to make more total time and make two movies.It is a good movie but is not my Harry Potter favorite movie.
5,Great,"We are a family that followed the adventures of Harry since the first book, Till now we like to watch this movie again."
2,Too dark to see,I have watched all the Potter films and I just finished watching Hallows Part 1. I know the plot was darker in tone than the others but why make the film so hard to see. Maybe its my eyesight - but frankly I could not see much for most of the film. Either nighttime or in the dark. Oh well - I listened. Very disappointed.
2,"Good movie, LOUSY quality DVD","I've just finished watching the DVD version of this movie and have to agree with earlier commenters.It is a TERRIBLE transfer -- the worst I've ever seen in a major release -- especially during the darker scenes, and scenes with static backgrounds. The quality is so bad I was actually wondering if I might have somehow received a bootleg DVD -- until I remembered that I had ordered straight from Amazon. Even the legalistic warnings at the beginning and end are fuzzy and grainy.I too have to conclude this was intentional, and feel cheated and disrespected by the studio. I suppose I am playing right into their hands in writing this, for my review will probably cause some people to now skip the DVD and buy the more expensive Blu-ray.This release is really inexcusable.This is a shame, as the movie itself is very, very good."
3,Misleading,"Seen the movie, love it, no complaints there. I have an issue with this combo pack, I love all the special features that comes with most dvd's. No where in the description of this product did it indicate that you can only watch that disc if you have a blu-ray player. We plan on eventually purchasing one, but all the same if I had known I couldn't see the special features without one I would have chosen a different dvd pack."
4,One the edge of your seat entertainment,"This is one of the darkest versions of the Harry Potter series seen to date. However, alot of questions left unanswered in the previous movies were answered. I would highly recommended viewing this movie."
5,Movie time w/ family,A good movie to have and to add to ur movie library. So u can have movie night any time you like.
3,HP& the Deathly Hallows DVD,"This DVD was not at all what I expected. Scenes were deleted, and the one's added at the end would have been better inserted into the film at the theater. I was mildly disappointed by the removal of scenes that I had seen in the theatrical version. This DVD was not labeled as a modified version and should have been."
1,The digital copy is expired,"Well this is a major rip off. I just bought this on on september 17, 2011. When i recieved item the digital copy expired on september 13, 2011."
2,Digital Copy Expired,"WB has decided to only honor the Digital Copy for 6 months. If you zoom in on the back of the Blu-Ray you will see an expiration of the middle of September. I am a fan of this movie in the Harry Potter series, but please save your money and buy the single disk addition and don't give WB any additional revenue as they have decided to screw the purchaser by no longer honoring the Digital Copy because it was ""a limited time only,"" but their are still happy to sell it to you the purchaser!"
2,Don't buy if you have a Samsung Blu-Ray Player,"On both my Samsung players (BD-P1500, BD-C5500), this disc's audio playback stutters noticeably at several points in the film, mostly at or near climaxes in the action. It's very distracting. I bought a LG Blu-Ray player, and it plays them correctly, so this is compatibility problem, but it's one that Samsung should have addressed a year ago.WB has been unresponsive to inquiries about the problem. I'm not sure if the discs are out-of-spec in terms of peak bandwidth, or what, but the two Deathly Hallows discs are the only Blu-Ray discs that have misbehaved on either player."
5,Good movie,"As I haven't read the Deathly Hallows in years and forgot a lot, this movie was a surprise and a reminder. I actually liked the movie better as the time in the forest seemed to drag forever in the book. My husband liked the movie too, and wanted to watch it again and he's not read any of the Harry Potter books."
5,Fantastic!,"Excellent action, terrific special effects and stuck closer to the book this time. Very enjoyable indeed. A definite 'watch again and again"" movie."
4,Harry Potter 7- Part 1,"Overall this movie was fun to watch but, it felt a bit rushed to me even though it was a 2 hour movie on it's own. The book contains so much detail that to really do it justice would probably take 3 movies. I'm looking forward to the last movie in July and hopefully the finale will live up to the rest of the series."
3,Harry Potter Walks and Talks (or My Dinner with Harry Potter),"Not the strongest of the stories as it is mostly about Harry Potter and the gang hanging out in a Tent / Forest and talking, staring at each other, getting cabin fever and a couple of action scenes. Not that this will stop you from buying it, but compared to the other stories, I would rather just add Part 2 to my collection and just skip this one. Though the acting holds up well, the camera work is excellent. Special Effects are top notch, I am grading on story excitement."
2,No Digital Copy - Expired,"This product is suppose to have a digital copy as per description from amazon. But when I tried to get the digital copy, it prompt that it was expired last september. Amazon didn't indicate that the digital copy was already expired."
2,OK,"The dual pack has the Movie in DVD and Blu-ray, but you can only view the extra features on Blu-ray,very disappointing to my kids."
3,Just OK,Having seen the prior movies in this sequel I was expecting big things out of this one. I was disappointed. It's not that the movie was not good it's just not much happened. It seems to me they could've made The Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 into just one. All in all though a great series and worth buying to complete it.
1,unable to download digital copy,"Ordered through amazon.com on 9/26/12, package delivered today, i9/27/12. Coupon says digital copy expires 9/20/12, but website says expires in November 2012. However, unable to download from teh WB site - consistently get error msg telling me to download through an Adobe-Flash enabled browser. I HAVE Adobe Flash installed, even downloaded it again more than once, same thing. CANNNOT DOWNLOAD and that was the reason I bought this copy! I have it on DVD, but wanted the digital copy to go with the others that I was able to get from iTunes. If anyone can explain to me what I am doing wrong, I will be more than happy to try again, otherwise I have to send it back and get my money back."
1,What a bunch of mush,"Sorry to buck the tide kids, but this thing was a disaster!The plot (if there was one) was hard to figure out. The audio was terrible, awash in background music to the pointthat you could not understand a thing the characters were saying; the English accents making it worse.I could not wait for this full length flapping and flailing chase to be over.I think the sorcerers have swung there wands and convinced the avid potter watchers that this is a good movie."
3,Dark and disjointed.,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is a dark and disjointed movie, hard to follow and difficult to get back on track after a break. Understandably, we are moving toward a final showdown, but this is a peacemeal come-on to lock the customer into buying the sequel. This is the first, really disappointing Harry Potter movie I have seen."
1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Was waiting for this for ever - what a disappointment that my Blu-Ray disc would not play on my Blu-Ray player because I did not have BDLIVE and my player hooked up to the internet. Pretty sad state when you have to have your Blu-Ray player hooked to the web. Won't be buying anymore Blu-Ray disc from Warner Brothers as I have no plans to hook my player to the internet. Good news - get to save money not bying this crap.
4,Where is the double disc of this movie on DVD?,"What happened to the two disc of this movies for the DVD version plus the digital copy? The Blue Ray has it, why not the DVD? If WB had release the double disc then I would have given it a 5 Star rating."
2,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"It seems like I waited forever to get this item, even though when I was tracking it, it had been in my home town for 3 days, just didn't show up at my house until a few hours ago. As I watching this DVD, it started skipping, just a little at first and then so badly that I had to skip entire scenes... I'm very upset that after I spent money on this DVD and waited for it to arrive, all I got was a DVD that skipped. I could barely watch it. I would not recommend this DVD to anybody. Go buy it at the store, which is what I now have to do..."
3,Not what I expected,I assume that #1 was building up to #2? Not much action in this one. I guess they figured the franchise sells itself. I hope #2 is where they spent the money.
5,Better than I hoped,The Last movie depressed me so much I was reluctant to watch this one until it was close to time for the last one to come out. I really loved this one. It moved the story along well and made me very interested in the outcome without depressing me forever.
4,Oh So Dark,"First, I would not let a young child see this movie ( +16 years old). It is dark and disturbing. I read all the books and have seen all of the movies in this series. This was not as much fun as the first few movies. This was a dark, brooding, and disturbing movie which I enjoyed a great deal. The battle between good and evil is not pretty but it is fascinating and engaging. A must see for Harry Potter fans, but I don't think I need to tell them."
2,Faster than a speeding bullet!!!,"Good thing, I read the Deathly Hallows in the book. I liked it very much. But the DVD finally came in and I just watched it. If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have been able to follow the story at all. The scenes changed so fast with a whsssh! They didn't make any sense at all."
2,Boring and a SHAMELESS cash grab...,This is by far the most boring of all these movies. More than half of it takes place in the woods where nothing really happens. All this could have been condensed to 5 minutes and there would be no need for the second movie.J.K. Rowling should be ashamed of herself for splitting this book into two movies and sucking her fans dry.
5,Great series continues to get better!!,"I know I'm in the minority when it comes to Deathly Hallows pt.1 because many don't like its pacing but I do. I love the fact that Harry, Ron and Hermione are off on their own, a quest for the horcruxs, a sort of twisted road trip capped off with a brilliant animated sequence telling the tale of the 3 brothers and the deathly hallows. Also, Voldimort is in truly wicked form as evil has descended on the wizarding world. It stands alone as a great addition to the Harry Potter franchise and of course sets up the grand finally of part 2 and grand is an understatement! I like watching parts 1&2 back to back...good times!"
3,"Good movie, poor 3d transfer.","This was a really good movie. I wanted to post a review becasue the 3d conversion was clearly rushed and lazyily done. My LG tv could do just as good at converting it, if not better. I bought it because my TV's 2d to 3d conversion is good but not as good as a real 3d Blu-ray. It seems that this was just a rush conversion by the producers to make money, rather than a strong effort to have a good quality conversion. Part 2 is great, but it was converted and had to face criticism in theaters so faced a greater need for higher quality.So is it worth it? For the average consumer, I would say no. However, as such a major fan I feel the need to own a copy of the 3d bluray package, so I dont realyl regret buying it. Still, I'm disippointed."
2,I didn't received the correct order...,"So I ordered the Harry Potter 4-Disc Deluxe Edition, and I received only instead the Harry Potter Combo pack... so what the heck is wrong with this people? I could have bought the same thing for a better price and better packing. So my packing was horrible, the package is very damaged, and the blu-ray case seems used... And also in the description, it says that the cover features Lord Voldemort and Harry! Only available for a limited time. And it was not included.So I want an answer...."
1,Poor Video Quality,The video quality was terrible. The whole bottom half of the movie was below the viewing area on the screen. All you could see were the tops of the movie character's heads. Don't waste your money. I ended up watching the movie on Direct TV during a tornado and got better video quality.
4,timing,"I was pleased when I found out that I could pre-order Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1. When I could have bought it four days before I received mine in the mail and a little cheaper. Needless to say, I was totally disappointed..."
1,"The movie is good, the DVD is terrible",I am watching this DVD as I write. So far we are 20 minutes in and have not gotten to the main menu yet. I don't need to see Four Video Game commercials and a documntary about a theme park. I will never buy another WB DVD ever again. I PAID for this? Commercials? No thank you. Ditch all the junk and give us some extras.
1,Disappointed,Why put this video in the catagory 3 combo pack DVD/Blu Ray/Digital copy if you only get one movie? That's false advertising.
1,VHS VERSION?!?!?!?!,"Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BR or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it soo bad on home media!"
2,sleeping potion,"Harry Potter might actually be Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up. He never learns any emotional self control, and everyone is keeping secrets from everyone else. This movie developed slowly and then crept along at a snail's pace. You simply want to slap the characters and say ""Get on with it!"". If it weren't for the villans, the film would have been even worse.My daughter will have us purchase it and she is readin the books and realizing how much better they are (in some aspects) than the movies however....they both grow old very fast."
2,A Disappointment,"I'll be the first to admit that I am not the greatest fan of Harry Potter. The first six movies, though, are enjoyable. For the most part, they are a nice mix of tension and comedic relief. However, when the Deathly Hallows Part I credits started to roll, my first reaction was: That's it!? The tension throughout the movie was constant and high. About midway through the film when our heroes were beset once again with trouble, it thought ""ho, hum, there's another set back."" Because of the consistent level of tension, I had no sense that the film was even coming to an end, and was taken quite by surprise at the suddenness of the ending. It held no dramatic effect whatsoever for me."
2,Dark and disappointing,Not your usual Harry Potter movie. Many scenes were dark and hard to see. Plot was murky at best. Hope the sequel is much better.
2,Not the theatrical version,"First of all - I loved the movie in the theater. However, upon watching the blu ray, I discovered that there were quite a few scenes missing. I was VERY disappointed. Why did they remove scenes??? Now, I have to try the find the real version & buy it all over again. What a rip."
2,Highly Overrated,So dark that you can't see the movie--must be the computer generation uses no light so the first 40 minutes of the movie are so dark that you can't see it. I'm sure it would be good if it wasn't in total darkness.
2,Boring,How boring? I forgot I saw it in a theater with a Potter fan. She wanted to go to the first showing of part 2 so I thought I would catch up. Don't bother. You didn't miss anything important.
3,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1","I thought the movie while good, was a little on the slow side. I hope that the last one will have much more action and move a bit more."
2,Great movie - terrible transfer.,"I purchased this movie after seeing it in theatres and it is clearly a masterpiece of film makingHowever, in the Blu-Ray transfer there's an abboration in the anamorphic lens used to make the transfer that causes the image to be non-square and a light bar to appear running down the left side of the image, approximately 20% of the way into the image, that appears and disappears approximately every fifteen minutes. On any sort of good viewing equipment this is noticable and highly distracting.The audio, on the other hand, is a superb mix, possibly one of the best I've ever heard, with more detail than was available in the theatrical release thanks to the additional bandwidth available on a Blu-Ray disc compared to the DD/DTS/SDDS tracks on the film print.Overall, although this is a great film, this review only receives two stars because for such a major release Warner Brothers should have double checked the digital transfer from film, and it's clear that they didn't."
4,Harry potter!,Good show. Husband thought it was too slow but as a Harry potter fan I obviously need it to go w the rest of my set;)
5,potterphile here,"I love Harry, Hermione, Ron, Minerva, Albus, Snape, Mad-Eye, Fred, George, Hagrid, Dobby, even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. I just love the Potter series and I would definitely tell anyone to read the books and watch the movies!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I made this purchase wanting a Blu-ray movie disc, a regular DVD movie disc and 2 special features discs (and I didn't really care about the format of the special features discs although, considering the price, I was expecting them to be blu-ray.) The description was a little vague giving no other description other than ""Blu-ray"", but the price was consistent with other Blu-ray + DVD + digital copy combo packages I have purchased through Amazon and so I placed my order for this ""Deluxe"" combo set. However, what I received was 1 REGULAR DVD movie disc (NOT BLU-RAY) and 3 Blu-ray special features discs! REPEAT: NO BLU-RAY MOVIE DISC! Buyer Beware!"
5,Awesome Movie,"I LOVED this movie. It's epic, suspenseful, Drama emotional, and even a bit of humor every now and again. It was very well done, and completely worth watching!"
4,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,","It's to bad it has taken so long to produce this series into movies. All of the main chracters are now young adults.I am a fan of the movie's series, but have never read the books. So all in all I like it!"
2,too much of it is dark & not viewable,"i usually enjoy harry potter movies and have them all but, this DVD was irritating because it is so darkly lit. i realize that night time scenes are suppose to be ""dark-ER"" for effect but, many of the scenes were not viewable due to poor lighting design and/or transfer quality (mentioned by reviewer: Ryan Rogers). i simply do not see the point in having it SOOOO dark that one can not enjoy the great acting, awesome special effects, and fascinating story line. my monitor (tv) is new & i did turn my brightness and contrast controls to maximum, to no avail :-("
2,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,"My husband and I thought this was very boring, compared to the other video's. Obviously a very good PR campaign. Now we have to buy the Part 2 so we can see what happens, hopefully it won't be as boring. Sad to end the series this way."
2,blu-ray skips,"This review is for my mom, whom and three others she works with, who purchased the movie on blu-ray. Some part into the movie, it stops and skips in the same place. Her co-workers reported this too. Skipping and stopping in the same place in the film. My mom had to eject the disc and and put it back in the blu-ray player for it to work again."
1,Buyer be ware!!,I purchased this title for the option of using the DVD and then the Blu-Ray when I got a Blu-Ray player. The DVD worked fine. The Blu-Ray doesn't work at all.Now I am out of the return period. Please do not purchase a DVD / Blu-Ray package . . Ever!! If you have a Blu-Ray Player you do not need the DVD if you may get a Blu-Ray player in the future the Blu-Ray disk may not play and you have ZERO Recourse.
3,The Book is Better.,"The Book is way better, but I could say that about all the Harry Potter Books. If you like the others, this will not disappoint. If you didn't like those, then why would you consider this one?I say go ready the book to find out what happens. It will be a much better experience than this will."
5,Best one yet!,"Considering the HP books are LOADED with material, I think that director David Yates has done his best work yet, in the franchise. This is, BY FAR, my favorite HP film and makes me uber excited to see part 2.The HP films have always been a bit of a disappointment to me, but beginning with GoF each film has become better than the one before it. With that said there are some omissions from the book, but you can't get everything about this book into a 2.5 hour movie. I personally think each HP movie should've been at least 2.5 hours long, just because of the wealth of material in them.I love everything about this movie. The directing is great, the acting is superb, the cuts and visuals are wonderful. I just can't say enough about how well this movie has been done. GET IT!"
3,What happens?,"I have to agree that this movie leaves a lot to be desired. As a hp fan, I anticipate the movies and expect them to live up to the hype. This film was moody and had little to no plot. The gang spends the majority of the movie searching for horcruxes in the wilderness. On the other hand, the production team was able to do a good job to make the movie an entertaining visual experience."
2,Where are the extras for DVD users?,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and pre-ordered the single DVD version of the movie. When I realized that there were no extras on it I actually considered buying the 3-disc blu-ray DVD combo pack, but apparently you can't watch the extras on DVD. What's up Warner Bros? Are you not making enough money on the franchise? You need to fix this."
2,3D version of HP Deathly Hallows Pt. 1,"This review is for the 3D version of Deathly Hallows pt. 1. This review is only for the 3D effects. If you liked the Harry Potter movies, then you should like this movie. My complaint is that the movie was obviously not filmed in 3D. The conversion from 2D to 3D has added some depth to many of the scenes, but there are no scenes where anything jumps off the screen at you. I have Avatar, Green Lantern, Mysterious Island 2, and Journey to the Center of the Earth all in 3D and those movies have numerous excellent scenes where 3D effects are amazing. There are times in them that makes one want to duck or blink one's eyes. There are no such scenes in this 3D version of Deathly Hallows 1. Really disappointed in the 3D effects."
1,rip off,"3 d effects so bad that i adjusted the settings on both my projector and blu ray throughout the movie . i thought something must be wrong. but no. finally got the idea to put in ""hugo"" as a reference 3d disc and everything was great. all i got out of this movie was frustration. that said, the 2 d version was great but don't waste your money here. i'm shocked that 3d is still so early in it's development when i see a product like this. i expected a blockbuster like this to command the best technology has to offer. i was wrong."
5,Potter riocks!,All of the books and movies were very entertaining and mind stretching. Radcliffe has an amazing imagination. The disparity between books and movies are not a bad thing. Each has its own charm.
2,"Great movie, expired digital copy","We were very disappointed to realize the digital copy was already expired when we received this movie. Extremely false advertising there, Amazon. They need to update the link. :("
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!!!,"The movie was fine - that's not why I'm writing. The Digital Copy was only good until September 2011 - if you try to redeem this after that date, it is not available anymore. Talk about false advertising!"
1,"Great film, horrible DVD packaging","It pains me to give anything related to Harry Potter one star, but I was so disappointed by Warner Bros cheap packaging that I had to rate it that way. This rating is only for the DVD itself- I though the film itself was one of the best (and definitely the most loyal) Potter film to date. But why are there no options for special features for DVD buyers? I was looking forward to purchasing a special edition two disc DVD loaded with special features for a fan like me, only to realize the only feature was additional scenes. No behind the scenes footage. No preview for the upcoming movie. No-that's only for people with a Blu Ray player. You think with the economy the way it is WB would realize many people can't afford higher priced products like a Blu Ray player, and it's unfair to make all the good features exclusive to that disc. It didn't make me want to buy a player-it just made me mad. If they do this for the final film I will be sorely disappointed."
2,Mediocre movie. Poor DVD.,"The first half of the book was pretty slow, so I wasn't surprised to see this movie was as well. Unfortunately, as a movie, this entry in the Harry Potter series really doesn't stand up on it's own. It's basically just filling the gap between the previous film and the upcoming final conflict. I suppose given the amount of story that is covered in the novel, this is a necessary evil.What I really want to review is the DVD picture quality. Oh my...it is bad. This is bar none the worst DVD quality I've seen since the original days of DVD. Compression artifacts are everywhere. Most noticeable is the area around Harry's glasses. There's nothing like mucking up the main character's face. As other reviewers have stated, the DVD isn't even at full capacity. Why press a DVD with unused space? I really hope this wasn't done on purpose to promote BluRay."
5,Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I was fantastic and I loved the film. The film was close to the book, but as usual, I enjoyed the book more then the movie. Good to have in your movie collectio."
3,Digital Copy has expired - Still not a bad deal for the DVD + blu-ray tho,"The digital copy on this set has expired. However, at the price it was at as of this writing, its still a better deal than buying the DVD and blu-ray separately, if you want to own both. This set is the same price right now as the blu-ray alone, so its nice to have the extra dvd to be able to play in my car where we don't have blu-ray."
3,harry strikes again but wait for future,its hardcore to review a series of ongoing movie deliberately spread over years and the finaleis yet to come leaving you half breathless for another year. good teenage entertainment.
4,"Harry Potter/Deathly Hallows, Part 1",Enjoyable Family movie. Looking forward to part 2. A bit dark but ok for older kids. The DVD/ Blue Ray combo works great.
5,Great movie,I received this movie for my birthday. I enjoyed this disk a lot. Just waiting for the second Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows movie to come out.
1,Worst enforced advertising ever,"Non-skippable trailers are common nowadays, but this movie had the longest advertising intro I've come across - even worse than Disney movies. Not even the 'stop' button worked. Adding insult to injury, the movie froze part way in, and my DVD player has to be rebooted, forcing us to watch the trailers again. At least fast-forward helped us through the second round.The advertising feature for the Orlando theme park is a real deterrent to repeat viewing of the DVD."
4,Redemption code has been extended,I just wanted to share with everyone just like a previous reviewer that the digital copy redemption code has been extended.I'll be transferring a copy to my IPAD. I just bought the blu ray combo from best buy earlier in the week. Enjoy
5,Outstanding!,"Simply outstanding movie. No, you don't see much of Hogwarts, but you're not supposed to. The Golden Trio are on the run, and this movie showed that perfectly. Perfect way to lead up to the final entry into the film series."
2,Packaging Error,"I'd had this item for a few weeks before I sat down to watch the movie. After I unwrapped it, I found that I had two ""Special Features"" discs and the DVD copy, but no Blu-ray disc. Very disappointed. Amazon refunded me, but I wasn't given the choice for a replacement."
1,Harry Potter,"The movie was fantastic, but the quality of the DVD is totally unacceptable. The movie is so dark that you can not see the scene. We returned one copy and got a second one which was no better."
2,Blue ray of 2 part collection is defective,Blue ray aspect of the DVD/Blue ray Harry Potter Deathly Hallows part 1 had issues and acts like its scratched skipping etc. but no scratch appears to be there. Disappointed as I know the Blue ray aspect of my player works with all my other blue rays. This is the 3rd time I have ordered a blue ray from Amazon with problems.
5,Essential addition to the movie collection,"When I saw the price for this item, I thought ""WOAH! A Harry Potter blu-ray/DVD combo with a Digital Copy for THIS price?! My lucky day!"" I purchased it right away and the quality of the product was fantastic! I suggest if you buy a copy of this movie, you get this edition!"
3,Blu-Ray doesn't play,The DVD version works but not the Blu-Ray in a Sony BDPS570 with latest firmware.What's up with that ?!?
1,Dont buy from them!,I received my dvd I'm the mail in a decent amount of time. I waited like two weeks before I had time to watch it. I get 10 minutes into the movie and it goes blank and a red pirating screen pops up. No more movie! I was pissed! Have not heard back from them.
1,Bad amazon,Would love to give this a better rating but being amazon has yet to allow it to download not possible. Hard to explain to a child why it won't download.
2,Very dark and not for younger children,"Not my favorite Harry Potter movie and is definitely NOT for young children. Dark theme with very few light moments. Is there any reason why the final book couldn't be covered in one movie? I anticipated greatness but feel extremely disappointed eventhough I read the book. Did the 48 hour rental bit and thankful I waited to see it. If I'd seen it in a theater, I'd want a refund. Gave it 2 stars(1.5 for actors and .5 for movie) because I've become a fan of some of the actors and not because it's a good movie. The cast did a great job with the poor script they were given. If a 1.5 star was available, that would be my rating. I'll watch the final one only after it's video release. Hoping it's better than this one."
1,"Stop, Do Not Purchase!!!","The silly Dobby ""bookend"" is in no way worth a basic no frills dvd, at a premium price.The picture quality is poor!!There is no DTS!!!Oh but wait all of this should be compensated with a poor bookend at a premium price!!!Do Not Buy This!!! You will be sorely disappointed."
2,what happened?,I am a huge Potter fan --this movie was long-dark-boring-I was shocked as they are always the best.The book was better-way better--maybe they shouldnt have dragged it out into 2 movies?
3,Not the best...but still Harry Potter,"The Deathly Hallows part 1 is by far the slowest, least fun packed Harry Potter movie made to date. It's strange to have character developement in the second to last film of a series, but to their credit, the trio really stepped up to the job and gave us some top notch acting. So although, I'm glad they split the last book into two movies (part 2 should be AWESOME!), it made for a somewhat boring part 1. But let's face it...you still have to buy this DVD because IT'S HARRY POTTER and you can't break up the set."
5,"If you liked the book, you'll enjoy the movie",Movie pretty much tracks the book. We are HP fans at our house so enjoy have the 3 different media for this movie.
2,Great Content...if the disk wasn't defective,"We ordered the Blu-ray from Amazon for delivery on the release date because the price was better than anywhere locally. Imagine our disappointment when we put the disk in to watch it and it stopped working after about five minutes. We watched the DVD version, but went out and replaced it the next day from C****o; cost a little bit more, but we knew that we could get an exchange or money back if it didn't work (it did play just fine). Amazon handled the return and refund just fine, but I have decided I would rather buy locally so that if there is a problem I can just swap it immediately instead of waiting for a replacement through the mail."
3,Slow moving,"This is much slower paced than the other Potter movies. Perhaps because it's a 2 parter, but slow. Also Amazon promised to deliver on the release date. This did NOT happen. It came about 4 days AFTER the release date. I would have purchased it several places, which match internet prices, had I known I wasn't going to get it on the release date as promised."
2,I hope the second part is better,"I really loved all the Harry Potter's except this one and the first one. The first one was too childish for my taste. And this one was too boring. Over half of the movie they are stranded on the side of a mountain or a hill waiting for Harry to figure out how to destroy a Horcrux. There were times when I wondered if J. K. Rowling has seen broke back mountain a few too many times. If Ron and Harry had been left on the side of the mountain who knows this might have come true. The movie was good up until the last hour where all you see is them trapped on the side of the hill. This may have been okay for the readers of the book but not for someone who is only into the movies. In the end I think that Warner Brothers is just attempting to milk this story for all its worth with its 2 parts. It would have probably been okay if it was all there, but then again what do you expect from a greedy company like Warner Brothers."
2,Dobby and the Deathly Hallows.,"I swear Harry has no power in this film, the most powerful thing in the movie are the elves who save everyone two or three times. Harry is nothing more then hype in this movie and is dragged around being saved by the whole good guy gang thru this whole Lobsterfest. Please give Harry some kind of power how can he be a hero of any sort when he can't wipe his own bum. How this painful excuse for a Harry Potter film gets a A- rating is beyond me. This movie should have been one hour long, but oh no we have to pad this snoozefest out to make two long and very boring sleep aids (maybe part two will have more action). This film would make my list of biggest disappointments for 2010, so if you have not seen this film I would wait for a cheap rental."
1,boo,"Most hyped up and also the most disappointing of all the movies so far. Parts that strayed from the book did so without reason and the parts that followed it felt like they were just being read line by line..doesn't have the dark feel to it that the book did at all, just felt boring."
3,lighting budget a little low,Basically I thought it was a OK Harry Potter movie but was disappointed by the lack of lighting. Much of the movie was filmed in poor dark lighting and it made it very difficult to watch the movie.
5,Another great movie!,"Every one of the Harry Potter movies has been great, and this is no exception. We've watched this countless times already!"
4,Dobby looks cute,"i only bought this for the Dobby bookend. It was worth that. the DVD is ok. the volume level is low. I have to turn the volume up to almost double what I normally use, but other than that no complaints.the Dobby bookend looks nice next to my HP books."
2,Poor dvd,"This dvd skipped at two parts of the movie, they skipped 3 to 5 min of film and there is no way to know what happened or what was said. I am disappointed and i have just bought it new from walmart instead. Sorry i hope your purchase is better"
5,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1,This was the most true to book movie that the series has. I am looking forward to the 2nd part.
1,No Digital Copy,"The product was not as described. I purchased it expecting the Bluray, DVD and Digital Copy but the Digital Copy was already expired. So just know no more digital copies."
1,digital copy NOT included,"I was very disappointed to open my copy of Harry Potter only to find the digital copy had expired two months ago. I would not have paid extra for nothing had I known that. If amazon wishes to sell this set, they should not charge for something that no longer is available."
2,Did anyone else have a problem with the Blueray disc not playing past intro?,"It pains me to have a negative review when it comes to Harry Potter, but this is over the disc and not the movie. I love the series and would love to be able to watch it again! Here is the problem. When I first received this movie, I was able to watch the BlueRay a total of two times before it would stop after the intro. The third watching attempt was a few days past 30 days and it would stick with no option to get to the movie. The DVD version plays just fine. After a little struggle, Amazon made a one time exception and replaced it. Now, after receiving it and deciding to watch it again I am encountering the same thing. This time I am SOL. I have a top of the line Sony BlueRay and have never had any other issue, so I know it is not my player. Maybe they were given a bad batch from WB? Did anyone else have this issue too?"
3,Not very magical...,"Since ""...Goblet of Fire"", the Harry Potter novels and movies have been on a slow steady slide from being charming original young adult fantasies to becoming pedestrian adult fantasies of the lowest order. This is the penultimate completion of that slide, with enough of the good stuff stripped out of the novel so as to render it almost faceless and meaningless. One of the themes of the last novel is that Harry has been ultimately betrayed and abandoned by all of the adults in his life - including Dumbledore, who was so busy acting so mysterious and wizardly that he did not tell Harry what he needed to know in order to survive. There is no trace of Harry Potter's inner conflict in this movie. All that leaves you with is a bunch of guys throwing power bolts out of magic wands. For that you can watch the X-Men."
4,"Spooky, Dark and Not for Kids","Parental Warning: This film is a solid PG-13 for good reason. It's not a children's movie, even though younger kids will be drawn to it by the earlier productions in the series. My suggestion is to gauge whether a kid is ready for it by requiring that they read the book first. If they can get through the monstrously-sized novel, after reading the other Potter novels, then they're probably able to understand the events than unfold."
1,Expired code with Disk. The Digital version expired. Do not buy this product!,"Just purchased this product for the Digital Item along with the disk, The authorization code is now EXPIRED! Do not buy this item! Spend less and buy the DVD or just the BLU Ray"
1,Product Quality Problem,"Like so many other reviewers my family found ourselves listening to a sound track while straining at a nearly black screen. We had heard this episode was 'dark' but really? I adjusted the brightness, sharpness and contrast settings on the television to the highest points and we could then see the images although the colors were gray and murky. This should be an unnecessary step to view a new digital release."
3,Disappointed - not by the movie,Disappointed that there are no extras for the regular DVD version in this combo pack (the single disk DVD version that you can buy apparently has no extras either). That means that folks without a Blu-Ray player don't get any extras. That really wasn't clear in the product details and I would probably have just bought the single disk version if I had known.
3,I agree with most reviewers,"I started watch it on DVD with an upscale player and first thing I did notice was the poor quality in video. Usually with new releases and the upscale DVD player, it turns out really well, not as good as Blu-Ray but still a pretty good picture. Not the case with this one. WOW. Lots of jagged lines around the images like I was watching a bad copied version. I never thought they would have done this to todays Harry Potter.As for the movie, It was slow alot of the times. I started to get bored really. The action scenes were good but it felt to me like they were trying to kill time around the middle part of the movie. That with the poor quality, I didn't enjoy this release as much as the past chapters. I hope they fix part 2."
5,Great movie!,Love this adventure movie!! We have all the Harry Potter movies and books! This movie is fun to watch and gets you ready for the end of You Know Who!!! :)
1,Need help!,"Would Like to see if i may exchange this for a replacement! We watched it three times feeling that it was just our equipment, but after trying it on a friends machine we have found the same concern. About half way through the movie the voices and film are off sync! Please let me know what i can do! Thanks"
5,very happy,"this item was bought as a gift i know it was what he wanted. item was as discribed, shipping was very fast,couldn't be happier."
1,Not Impressed,Amazon instant video doesn't play on droid devices. Netflix does. Makes it a pretty easy choice. Amazon needs to upgrade.
4,One of the Best Potters!,"After finding the Half Blood Prince to just be dark and dull, I wasn't looking forward Deathly Hallows: Part 1 much at all. With that said though, I was pleasantly surprised how well done the movie was.The film isn't just dark with barely any charm or laughs like the last film. There's plenty of magic, excitement and heart-felt moments that will keep you entertained through-out. This Potter is easily one of the years best and one of the best Potters!"
1,I am rating both the extras and any seller trying to scam you.,"From what I can tell, these extras are not worth buying it at the actual value of $19.99. Any seller doubling, tripling, quadrupling, or as I see currently sextupling the price, should be ashamed of themselves. But if you're a buyer considering paying this amount for it, shame on yourself. You can watch the extras on you tube and they're not much to look at. Some day I'll end up with blu ray probably. I bought the combo pack when WB refused to make this a wide regular dvd release. It may mean delaying gratification, but if the alternative is paying someone SIX TIMES what the dvd is worth (and I don't think it's worth the original price for what WB didn't offer dvd users), then I will gladly wait. Buyer beware."
1,no good dvd,"It came in and wouldn't play; so they were supposed to send me a good one and I've not heard back from him in about 2 wks; I really would like the replacement, and to be able to send the original one back to them....at least I can usually get an answer by email. np"
4,"Great movie, DVD packaging gets worse and worse!","I think the movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1, is really good. You do need to read the book to catch a lot of the nuances in the film however. My biggest complaint is the DVD package itself. The cover looks like it is about to fall out of the DVD case. It is in really bad shape. The fact that the extras are only being placed on the Blu-ray versions is also a crock. Great movie, the customer with a regular DVD player is really getting bad treatment though."
3,Picture Quality very dark,Can't watch this in the day time it's so dark you can't see a thing. Have to watch at night with no lights on. Very disappointed. Good thing I read the book.
1,Pre-orders through Amazon suck,"I pre-ordered this movie a day or so before it came out with the understanding that I wouldn't get it the day it was released. However, today, a few days after I placed the order, I received an email from Amazon bumping the ship date out even farther than they originally stated. No big deal, I figured I'd just cancel the order and buy the movie somewhere else. However, when I go to my Amazon account I can't cancel the order because it is being prepared for shipping. If they were going to move the ship date they should have at least left me the option to cancel the order. Huge dissapointment; I will never pre-order through Amazon again."
1,Deathly Hallows,"DVD was a clumsy knockoff...flickering images, bad sound...a great disappointment and complete waste of money Seller should be banned from Amazon."
1,"Blue Ray only has special features,,,,,","I originally invested in this product because of the special features, however ONLY the blue ray comes with the special features! The DVD in this combo pack is the movie by it self. If you do not own a Blue Ray player, (or are not planning to own one soon), DO NOT GET THIS COMBO PACK. Just get the DVD with the less extensive special features. The movie is worth owning, just the packing of the separate features is misleading which is why I am giving this product 1 star. The movie itself rates a much higher score."
1,Movie Sucks,"Unlike all the previous Potter flicks dialogue on this one was not understandable. All mumbling and very little English articulation. Movie had to be watched several times or backed up to get dialogue and answer the questions, ""what did he/she say?"",. Also, to criptique to follow smoothly. Only $4 but not worth the cost."
2,Not exciting.....Terrible 3d,"I quit watching this half way thru,I found it boring,and the 3d effects were minimal at best.It almost looked like 2d,the 3d was that bad.If your looking for a good movie,with good 3d,pass on this one."
4,Harry Potter/ Deathly Hallows Pt.1,I didn't purchase the DVD but saw it in the theatre. I enjoyed the film. not as much action as other films but I liked it. I will order a DVD when the supply is better.
4,"Run, don't walk, to buy this CD!!","Have you ever had a CD that you could listen to non-stop, or just have to play in the car on a road trip? Well, this is that CD for me. The whole CD is GREAT, but my favorites are ""someone else's eyes"", ""all the time in the world"", and ""been tried before"". If you ever have the chance to see The Pistol Arrows live, I HIGHLY recommend it! There are songs on the CD that are better live, but that is true for any good band. If you do happen to catch them live, listen for ""old feelings"", ""been tried before"", and ""she don't need me"". That last song isn't on the CD, but is AMAZING! This is a great CD and it will quickly become one of your favorites."
3,Do not Waste your Time or Money,"My son was just dying to have this game last year and we've not played with is much since last Christmas. You spend more time setting the game up then playing it and it EATS batteries like crazy. My son does love this game, no doubt about it but it's frustrating how all the butterflies get stuck and then they come out so fast the kids can't catch them. They really need to re-design this product and maybe make it a little more kid-friendly next time so mom and dad don't have to set it up every single time the butterflies are gone. It certainly is not worth the money."
1,Not so much fun,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was 3, she became easily irritated that it was over so quickly, the butterflys shoot out in 3 seconds and it takes 2 minutes to get the game ready. She played it once. Since then it's sat in our closet. She says we can get rid of it now."
4,FUN ALL OVER AGAIN,"We originally had this toy for my first son and he always loved it. He's now 13 but we now have a two year old so we decided to get him one two. While he hasn't quite grasped the concept of trying to catch the butterflies in the net, he loves seeming them fly out of the elephants trunk and jumps up and down when they do.I'm confused by some of the reviews that said it goes through batteries after playing it a few times. We've played it quite a bit these first two days and it seems to be playing as good as ever. Perhaps they are using cheap batteries. There's no substitute for Energizers.Also, i have no trouble with playing it on carpet as someone mentioned. They must have some VERY thick plush carpet to be having trouble. While the game isn't overly educational it's fun and should help with the motor skills and hand-eye coordination of your young ones."
1,Too much work to maintain,"I bought this game for my neices ages 4 and 6. What a disappointment. They were excited to recieve this gift as they have seen it on TV. But were very disappointed afterwards when after I set this game up it didn't work. What to do..... return it or try to fix it???? First we straightened the folded butterfly wings, checked the strength of the batteries and cut 6inches off the trunk. It worked fine for 2 days. The base of the trunk is now weakening from use and collapsing while playing game. I do not recommend this game unless you don't mind troubleshooting every game. This will probably end up in the trash in 1 week. I am very disappoimted!!! bjallison"
1,A terrible toy,I can't get this toy to work. This toy won't get the butterflies out. You can lose the butterflies eisily. My brother isn't having fun with it.
1,no fun,"My daughter wanted this so bad for her 4th birthday, it was such a disappointment. The butterflies barely come out of the trunk! Not at all like they show it. My kids had more fun playing with the nets!"
2,This was a HUGE disappointment and WASTE of $$,"This was a HUGE disappointment. I thought it would be an ideal gift for my son, but I've spent more money than I like to think about just to keep fresh batteries in it. As soon as the batteries start to wear down (which is pretty quickly), the fan slows down and the butterflies become stuck in the trunk. I'm sure my almost-four-year-old would give it five stars for fun if it always worked when he wanted to play with it, but because of this game, I've begun to ration my batteries. As other reviewers mentioned, there needs to be a lot more butterflies included. This could be a great game for kids if the manufacturers made a few changes, but as it is, I recommend that parents save their money."
1,The butterflies refuse to come out!!!,"I was so excited to buy this for my three year old daughter. I figured it would reinforce counting and colors as well as eye hand coordination. When we started playing, the butterflies took forever to shoot out. I opened it and mixed them around as the instructions stated but still only one or two popped out. The rest kept blowing around on the bottom. Very disappointing. After a while my daughter said ""all done Mommy"". She was bored standing there waiting for the butterflies. I dont blame her, I was bored myself. The fan worked fine and the trunk fully extended & I put fresh batteries so Im not really sure what went wrong. Its such a nice idea but Im sad to say its a lemon of a game."
3,Loud and awkward to use.,"Has a warning about being careful with not getting hair caught in the motor, but you have to open this toy to replace the ""butterflys"" each time, exposing the screened motor. Really needs alot of supervision. Then the things come down so fast, and scatter about, so that if you have more than one kid, they would all be bouncing around trying to get the ""butterfly"" - someone is going to get hurt. It's loud too. The company sent me a second one, but it's exactly the same as the first. It's a good idea, but has problems."
2,Frustration,"This toy could be fun if it were redesigned. The fan is not powerful enough to blow the butterflies out of the trunk. There is a safety button on the bottom of the toy which needs to be pressed past flush to activate the fan. For my son to play with it, I have to hold the elephant and press the button myself. The toy almost has enough power to blow a few butterflies out of the trunk. When they get stuck, I have to shake the toy. It takes so long for the butterflies to come out that my 4 year old gets bored. He has only played once, but the trunk is already showing signs of wear. It looks great in the ad, but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Doesn't work correctly,Bought it for my 2 year old and 4 year old neice and the fan is not strong enough to blow out the butterflies even with new batteries and we also cut off a couple of inches from the top and it didn't help. The girls finally took the trunk off and would place the butterflies in and turn it on and watch them blow around. A waste of money.
2,don't waste your money. you will spend oodles on batteries,"The first game we ordered blew out about 2 of the butterflies in 60 seconds. brand new ""radio shack"" batteries. sent it back for a replacement as this is nothing like the commercial. The second one did not blow out any butterflies. I thought, maybe, I got bad batteries. Put in another new pair of batteries, this time an expensive name brand set. It then worked better, however, my 3, 6, and 8 yr. olds got bored waiting for the butterflies to blow out. I thought what would happen when these brand new batteries are not brand new? This replacement elefun is going back also. Great idea but needs some work."
4,fun in the rain,"My 2 year old loves this game. It is a great way to burn off energy indoors when weather doesn't let you play outdoors. we did cut an inch or two off of the trunk this makes the butterflies come out much quicker, but it would be nice if they had replacement butterflies. overall this is a great fun game."
2,Needs a stronger motor,"I was very disappointed. I saw the commercial and thought this game would be great for my children (ages 3 and 6).We set it up and it actually worked great once (the butterflies shot out fast), however ever since that one time it seems the motor is not strong enough. The button on the bottom is not level with the actual bottom of the elephant, so even if it sits on a hard surface, the motor is still not strong enough to shoot out butterflies fast. It seems to take about 2 minutes to shoot out 1, meanwhile the kids have already lost interest.It is a shame because the game looks like a great deal of fun."
3,Poor quality,"My daughter received this game as a gift from her grandparents. She was very excited to play with this, because she's been seeing it on the commercials. Well, her excitement didnt last long -- we tried several new sets of alkaline batteries, and the fan just wasnt strong enough to work. We've had the toy for less than 24 hours, and now the fan doesnt work at all --- this game is definitely going back to the store. Great concept, but poorly constructed!!"
4,Burns energy,"My 3 year old son received this game for his birthday and loves it. I know it is a pain to keep reloading it because the butterflies come out so fast, and the trunk has to be repositioned by hand every time, but my son still wants to play it everyday. I enjoy the time with him. Eventually he will be able to work the game alone, but what fun will that be!!!"
1,terriable,This was the most waste of money I have ever spent. The butterflies don't even come out of the basket. The never make it up the trunk. They just fly around in the basket. I would never recommend this game to anyone.This was a real shame because it really looked cute on TV.
4,Fluff those butterflies!!!!!!!!,I initially gave this a bad review. My son got this for his birthday and we had the problem with the butterflies not coming out. I saw one reviewer mentioned to fluff them. I ignored that thinking it was not going to do anything. It made ALL the difference!!!!! Take the butterflies and poke the wings until they bend in the opposite direction (like you are turning a sock inside out). The wings will kindof make a cup shape instead of the flat circles. I can not believe how much of a difference that has made. Now of course it works too well. All the butterflies come out in less than 30 seconds. I would much rather have them all come out at once than 2 in 5 minutes. We have played that game at least 20 times already and my son has been just as excited about catching those butterflies the last time as the first time it worked correctly.
3,Fun but not durable,"My daughter received this toy for her birthday. It didn't take a lot of work to set this toy up but it didn't last long either. Not all of the butterflies that you have to catch with your net would come out. We kept having to adjust the elephant's trunk. Overall this toy is pretty fun, my daughter liked it, but it's not durable."
2,Great premise with little promise,"The idea of catching butterflies greatly apealed to my 4 year old since she is an avid lover of insects, but the game fell seriously short of my expectations. I agree with other reviewers who cannot get this toy to work effectively even with fresh batteries. My daughter tried for 30 minutes to get it to work, and was thrilled when one or two butterflies would finally flitter out of the elephant trunk. For the money this toy needs some serious modifications to make it a more reliable unit, and therefore worth spending my hard earned money. Also my child has better things to do than wait on a poorly designed game to work."
4,Let's be creative,"We bought this game for our 4 and 2 year old, but our 7 year old enjoys is as well. It's great for hand and eye coordination and it is educational. When all of the butterflies are out we (4 and 2 yr old) count them as we put them back in and for my 7 year old - a lesson in math: How many butterflies are there? If you caught 10 and Anna caught 3 how many are on the floor.We haven't run across the problem with batteries and the bending of the wings works perfectly, but more butterflies would be nice. Maybe that will be our next craft project:)And I can't wait to test the nets for real butterfly catching."
3,Not very fun,They had this toy at my old school- Not very fun. The butterflies get caught in the trunk and you have to fish them out.(The trunk and butterflies are very poor quality)I do not really reccomend this toy for anyone.
1,not what it seems,"We gave this to my daughter for Christmas last year and she loved the idea of it. She loves to catch anything in a net, ie: jellyfishing. Like most of the reviews this thing doesnt perform like it should. It squirts out a couple of butterflys every minute or so but eventually slows down. I saw one review about static cling. I wonder if the dryer sheet thing helped any. However when you look down the elephants trunk you can see the butterflys swirling around in there, they are not stuck to anything.This is something that needs redesigned I think. Its a wonderful idea but is such a waste of money."
2,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,"My mom bought THREE of these, the others did not work right.. you have to wait a long time for the butterflies to come out of the trunk.. it is a little dissappointing because it they do not come out. The fan is not strong enought to push the butterflies out. At the end my mom returned all of them."
3,I'm taking it back,I was extremely dissapointed with this toy. I put brand new batteries in it and within 15 minutes (probably 5 minutes of actual fan blowing) they were almost completely dead and not powerful enough to blow a single butterfly out. I put another set of new batteries in and this time about half the butterflys came out (with some shaking and coaxing) before I finally gave up. What a total waste of money. I'm taking this back to the store today.
2,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY","I bought this toy for my four year old daughter and 2 1/2 year old twin daughters, For what this game cost it should have been made more durable. This game is made so cheap that the nets break easy and the butterflies are made of paper. My kids were so excited to play this and once we set it up, they lost interest fast. the trunk is to long and weak so it doesn't really work that great. I think if they made it so it plugged in rather then using batteries it would have had more power. it looks a lot more fun on tv that is for sure. It is just a toy that will be packed away and not used any more. I will be writing to the company and telling them how unhappy I was with their product."
2,POOR QUALITY,I am mother of two kids one 7 and 3 1/2. They asked Santa to bring this for Christmas. I was very disappointed right from the start with the poor quality of the fan. It does not have enough power after 3 or 4 rounds of playing. The kids had a lot of fun at first but were upset when the butterflies would not come out anymore. Of course this was returned much to the upsetment and disapointment of the kids. My sister-in-law also bought this for her kids same age as mine for Chirstmas and will be returning it also because of same complaints!!!
3,Disappointing Performance,"We got Elefun for our children for Christmas, but quickly found that it does not work very well. Firstly, it is not easy to get the trunk in its upright position without adult assistance. The second problem was the butterflies. Half of the butterflies seemed to shoot out almost immediately and the other half of the butterflies remained trapped in the head cavity (spinning ...just not rising out of the trunk). Thirdly, it ate through a brand new package of 4 Duracell M3 batteries in one day! I would have loved for this game to work better, since my 3 year old thought it was cute and kept trying to play with it until the batteries died."
1,Not powerful,We are returning the game. We followed the directions but themotor is not powerful enough to blow the butterflies out of the trunk. Some of the butterflies did not come out.
2,Only worked for 1 day,My kids had been asking for this game forever! I finally decided to buy it and was very disappointed. The fan didn't work for very long. I even changed the batteries a couple of times. The butterflies had trouble making it to the top of the elephants trunk. More irritating then fun! It just sits in the closet.
2,"Fun, but only with new batteries each time!","This game is cute, silly, and perfect for toddlers. The bad news is that the butterflies only blow out if the batteries are brand new. After two or three rounds, the fan slows and no longer blows out the butterflies well, sending out maybe one or two every couple of minutes. When the batteries are first put in, it's a lot of fun. Half an hour later, it's no fun at all. I am returning this game. There are plenty of other cute. silly toddler games out there which do not require fresh batteries every day, such as Crocodile Dentist."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This toy is just awful. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she was so excited. So I put it all together and turned it on...and nothing. The butterflies blow around inside the elephant, but they do not come out of the trunk. Thinking it was just a dud, I exchanged it. New Elefun but still the same problem. So if your child enjoys standing around holding a net for 10 minutes waiting for butterflies to come out of the trunk, this game is for you. Otherwise, I'd save your money."
2,Short on fun,"My son received this as a gift. First, we had to help our child get the trunk to stand up so the things would blow out. Second, it worked a few times and then seemed to lose it's ""umph"". So, I changed the batteries. That didn't help, though. Pretty soon the fan stopped working enough to blow the pieces out of the trunk. My child was so disappointed I had to start ""manually"" throwing the pieces in the air so he could catch them with the net. This toy quickly was ""out of sight-out of mind"" and into the trash."
4,Need more butterflies!,My 2 1/2 yr old loves this game. She even picks them up and puts them back in the elephant to start a new game. It does blow the butterflies out fast. It would be nice to have more butterlies especially if more than 1 child is playing. We had 3 kids playing all at around 2-3 yrs old. They had trouble actually catching them in the net. So we played it where they picked them up off the floor becasue they were getting frusterated that they weren't catching any.I might try to make some more butterflies out of tissue/crete paper. That's all it is anyway.
4,Daughter loves this game,My daughter has been wanting this game for a long time. I was very skeptical after reading the reviews on it. I decided to go ahead when toys r us ran their buy one get one free deal on games. I gave it to her this year for Christmas and she loves it! She doesn't care that it only lasts for a few seconds because she has learned how to reload the butterflies herself. But if I was going to complain about anything it would be the fact that the butterflies do fly out pretty quickly so all you feel like you are doing is refilling the trunk. I had no trouble with it other than that and to me if my daughter is having fun then that is what is important!
2,Cheaply Made,"My 3 year old received this as a gift and loved it...the first couple times. By the 3rd or 4th time it was played, the tall sleeve (elephant's nose) had a split seam causing the fan to lose its force and the butterflies were no longer blowing out the top. Very disappointing. We tried to fix it and ultimately threw it away! It's a great idea; it just needs to be made of stronger material."
4,"Cute, fun game for toddlers",this game is easy to set up and my almost 3 yr old has a lot of fun chasing the butterflies. This is probably good for 2 1/2 to 4 yr olds.
3,"Fun idea, poor design","My 5 year old son and 2 year old daughter like this toy but more time is spent loading up the butterflies than actually playing it. I agree with the previous reviews that state, ""It needs more power!"" as half the butterflies never come out. It also needs a better design. The inside of the elephant has lots of nooks and crannies where the butterflies get stuck and cannot be pushed out with a weak motor. If they added another layer of plastic inside to streamline the butterflies up the tube it might be helpful."
1,"Messy, Floppy, Annoying Toy","This toy is a pain in the neck.I thought it looked cute and may be fun for my twins. The ""butterflies"" all come out very quickly and mostly all over the floor. It takes a few seconds for the fun to be over. SO.... it's reset and restart every 30 seconds or so.That is frustrating for the parent and the kids. The quality of this product could be better, as could the execution (timed releases of the butterflies perhaps).I found it very annoying personally. The kids didn't really enjoy it after the first 2-3 resets."
2,Don't bother trying to replace the batteries...,"...that's not the problem. Notice how it seemed to work the first few times, then the butterflies just stopped coming out? It's because once the plastic trunk gets wrinkled, it creates too much air disturbance and does not allow the butterflies an easy path out. A stronger fan might do it, or a wrinkle-free tubing. Oh well...it was a good idea anyway."
1,NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT,WE PURCHASED THIS GAME FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY DAUGHTER ASKED FOR REPEATEDLY. WE OPENED THE BOX AND PUT NEW BATTERIES IN IT AND IT BASCIALLY DID NOTHING. ONE BUTTERFLY WOULD COME OUT EVERY FEW MINUTES. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS. THE FAN IN THIS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH. IF THEY COULD MAKE THIS TOY WITH A STRONGER FAN THEN IT WOULD BE FINE.
2,BUTTERFLIES DO NOT COME OUT,"LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY FUN GAME...IF THE BUTTERFLIES WOULD COME OUT. THE FAN IS SIMPLY NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BLOW THE NYLON BUTTERFLIES UP THE TUBE. ONE OR TWO BUTTERFLIES COME OUT EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES OR SO...MY 3-YEAR-OLD GOT VERY BORED WITH THIS GAME WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. GREAT CONCEPT FOR A GAME, BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT FROM THE MANUFACTURER. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT FOR CHRISTMAS MORNING."
2,This game was BAD!!!,I just got this toy for my 2 year old and it was a BIG let down!!! It takes the butterflies like 10 min. to come out one at a time!!! It was not worth the (...)dollars I spent!!
2,"A fun game, but.....","the butterflies continualy get stuck in the elephant. Within the first few seconds, about half of the butterflies come out. It is actually fun, and, as one of the other reviewers said, it is harder to catch the butterflies than it looks. After that half comes out, we just sit there and wait. The butterflies don't come out. I've tried shaking the elephant to ""unstick"" some of the butterflies. That may produce an additional 1-2 butterflies..nothing more. I may try cutting the trunk to see if that helps. Again, it is a really fun game which my 2 1/2 year old loves, but it doesn't work for long."
2,Not Worth It,"This game would have been more fun if there were about 100 more butterflies. The butterflies come out for about 5 seconds and then you have to reload. The batteries have to be brand new to generate enough power to blow out the butterflies too. I returned mine and got ""Pop Up Pirates"" which is more fun."
4,Good toy.,"This was a requested Christmas present for a four-year-old grandaughtere. Although it was kind of a challenge to put together and required size ""C"" batteries. it worked as advertised after we got it going. The grandaughter has played with it with her friends several times."
1,Frustrating and disappointing.,"The premise behind this toy is perfect. Catching butterflies coming out of an elephants trunk. Which kid wouldn't love it! However this toy is awful. The butterflys get stuck easily in the body. The trunk never fully extends so at times the butterflies get trapped. The motor is no where near powerful enough to blow out the butterflies. I could put up with having to refill it every couple of minutes and replace the batteries often if it worked, but it doesn't. It just becomes frustrating and the kids get disappointed."
2,Shaking my head...,"I bought this several years ago when it first came out, it was in the trash a couple weeks later... The game doesn't let the butterflies come out consistantly. I found myself sitting with my then 2 year old unfolding butterflies because that is the only way I could get a few to fly out for her. She enjoyed it but I just couldn't stand it anymore! For the couple of butterflies that would pop out and the 10 minutes it took to unfold them all and then trying to keep the nets on the net handle this was too much of a hassle."
4,Fun game for the little ones,"BUT it is very hard for them to get the trunk to stay up, so it isn't something they can play themselves. The nets want to come apart also"
5,Great Game for 2yr Olds!!,"My two year old daughter loves this game. It is a fast game, the butterflies fly out and then you put them back in. She loves to try to catch the butterflies and then just as much loves to gather them up and put them back in again. The butterflies have four different colors and has helped me teach her what they are. She will scream out the color of the butterflies as they come out. She is also very willing to share this game with her friends, which is not always the case with that age group. This game however does require an adult or older child to help set it up each time, but you will really enjoy playing this game with your two year old.I didn't find this toy to have any static problems or battery eating problems."
2,Not much fun for 2 - 3 year old; Slow,"Butterflies don't all come out (static cling?); takes more than 5 minutes for all of them that do want to come out to do so (that's about 5 butterflies per minute). My toddler is extremely patient, but this is beyond his limit. He loves the box, though..."
2,Bad Experience,"If the toy was well made, it could be fun, but after being played only a few times, (4), it broke down. [...] You can afford to market higher quality than this!"
2,too frustrating,"You spend far more time setting this game up, and trying to get the butterflies to come out, straightening the trunk, etc., than you do playing. The concept is good, but I would rather have paid more for a little better quality. This spends most of the time on the shelf...eventually I'll throw it out."
3,Battery Sucker,My son wanted this toy so bad it was all he talked about for 2 months. He received it as a Christmas gift and has only got to play a few times because it keeps draining the battery. He played with it 2 different days for 1/2 hour periods and the batteries were dead. The butterflies all come out at once so he can only catch a few. He does enjoy playing but it is a pain having to pick up all the ones he missed reload and start all over every 2 minutes plus the expense of batteries. He has had the toy now for 4 months and we stopped replacing the batteries because we just can't afford it every week.
1,Full of Disappointment!!!,I bought this game for my daughter for her 2nd birthday in November. The butterflies would not come out of the elephants nose. The fan doesnt seem to be strong enough. Very disappointed we took it back.. It looked like so much fun on T.V. and she really wanted to play it. So I decied to give it another try and bought it for her again for Easter. Once again we were faced with the same problems. It takes about 5 minutes for 1 butterfly to come out and by that time she has lost all interest. I called Milton Bradley to complain and they just said they would send me a replacement. I dont really know what good that will do until they actually fix the mechanical problems!
2,This Elephant Blows!,"This game doesn't work. The butterflies just swirl around inside the elephant and do NOT blow out of the trunk. I read the ""troubleshooting"" portion of the directions which state, ""stir the butterflies up if they don't come out"", but that doesn't help. After the first 5 butterflies come out, the rest remain inside. Not too much fun. My kids were dissapointed, and so am I!"
2,A better idea,"Give your child a spoon or a net and set a bowl of rocks in front of them. Wait until the law of gravity expires and the rocks lift out of the bowl. Then catch the rocks.You would probably have more fun doing that than waiting for the butterflies to come out of the elephants trunk. It's a nice idea, and would be fun if it worked. It needs a higher powered fan because it just doesn't lift the butterflies out. We get maybe 3 or 4 butterflies out. As the box suggests ""if the butterflies get stuck in the trunk, turn the machine off and the game is over."" Wow."
5,"Great fun, poor durability","I got this toy for my 3+ year old daughter and she adores it. She can play this game over and over and not get bored.However, there are not enough butterflies and when the batteries start to run out the power is not strong enough to propel the butterflies out of the trunk. I found the toy to really chew through batteries because of this.The trunk gets wrinkled from storage which makes it more difficult for the butterflies to be expelled.The motor in our toy broke after only a couple of months. Hasbro has offered a replacement but has not come through yet due to stock problems."
2,Ele-LAME,"This sure looked fun on TV...my daughter wanted it so badly, so we went to a department store, it all up, and yes, the first 3 SECONDS were fun, after that, it was just us, staring at each other, waiting for the rest of the butterflies to come out. Only about 17-20 of the entire 30 butterflies come out, and having played it about 12 times already, never have the whole 30 come out. So the game ends faster, you have to shut it off, take it apart, reload. I would love to take it back,but my daughter still doesn't have that sense of ""getting what you pay for"", so we'll have to settle for that fun 3 seconds. As far as durability, the trunk is easily collapsed, and the more you use it, the crinklier it gets, becoming even more prone to collapsing."
2,Poorly Made,This is a really cute idea - if it worked. The motor is not strong enough to blow the butterflies out of the trunk. I would not recommend this toy at all. It is a waste of your money.
4,"Great toy, but the butterflies get stuck....",".....my two daughters (ages 6 and 2) bought this with Christmas money. They LOVE playing with it, but the butterflies take a long time to come out. I found that running a dryer sheet around the inside of the elephant and the inside of the trunk helps. It seems that static builds and the fan doesn't blow the butterflies out like it shows on t.v.. They still have a lot of fun with it."
1,Waste of Money,"Like many of the reviewers here, I have to say that unless the makers redesign this toy, do not purchase it because, frankly, it does not work. Both my sister and I have this toy, and even with fresh batteries, one butterfly might eek out of the trunk. I even tried to cut the trunk off shorter, but that didn't help. The fan is simply NOT strong enough. I saw a commercial for this toy on tv today, in fact, and it infuriated me because TONS of butterflies are flying out everywhere with laughing children. That is NOT the picture at our house, believe me! Very disappointing!"
4,got batteries?,"Fun, yes. But it has eaten 1 set of 4 batteries every day for the first week. Without fresh batteries the butterflies don't fly. why didn't they make this a plug-in toy?"
2,Elefun Game,"We received this as a Christmas present last year, and my two girls, 3 and 5, were very excited to play with it. It turned out to be very hard to catch the butterflies for them and their cousins, which frustrated them and took away from their enjoyment of the toy ( you know how children love to win!). Also, the elephant's trunk constantly gets clogged, and this requires CONSTANT help from the parents. On a positive note, if that doesn't detract you, it is educational for a child's hand-eye coordination skills. For our family, it became more hassle than fun, and we gave it to charity."
2,Eats Batteries,"This toy would be much better if the fan was a bit more powerful, and it didn't need new batteries every time we play!"
3,"Fun for kids, but requires lots of work for parents","My kids love this toy. They have so much fun trying to catch the butterflies. The only downfall is that it requires a lot of work on the parents part. The kids can't set it up by themselves because it takes someone tall to extend the trunk out in order for the butterflies to blow out properly AND if you have very independant children like I do, they have to try and do it themselves anyway. Game play goes by extremely fast (more butterflies might have helped). Although I haven't had to put in a new set of batteries yet, I have noticed that the batteries are very weak after just a handful of uses. Overall, even though this game requires a lot of work on my part, it is worth it because my kids love it."
3,Elefun for only moments,"My daughter has had this game since she was 2.5 yrs and was capable of playing it just fine. My major issues with it are that there is little power in terms of the trunk staying up and getting all the butterflies to shoot out, the motor itself is VERY noisy, and the game lasts a total of maybe 45-60 seconds. Then you have to shut it off, pick all of the scattered butterflies that were missed up, and go through it all again. I don't think it has much staying power as it is, though I think the concept is very cute. The reality does not hold up to the concept."
3,Very fun toy not made well,My girls love this toy. The scream with delight when ever we get this one out. I am disapointed with the quilty but still a fun game.
3,not worth it!,"I bought this game for my 2 year old, and it was a waste of money.I wish I would have read the reviews first! She likes watching the ""butterflies"" come out but it takes forever since the fan doesn't have enough power. I gave it 3 stars because she is kind of entertained by it but its a hassle, also they don't give out enough butterflies with the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone!"
2,Not much fun,I bought this toy for a five year old. The only problem with this toy is the butterfies all come out in about 10 seconds and then you have to take off the trunk and put the butterflies back in. My grandaughter got tired of constantly picking up all the butterflies and reloading the trunk. This would be a really fun toy if the butterflies didn't come out so fast.
2,Ele-Sucks!!,We got this toy yesterday along with brand new bateries. My daughter used it a few times and today it barely pushes 5 buttlefies out. Get (...) something else perhaps a couple of good books.
1,"Elefun does not work, do not buy it!!","Elefun simply does not work. The motor is very weak. It is not strong enough to blow the butterflies off the bottom. I bought 3 different ones and none of them worked. I called Hasbro and they sent me one, it does not work either."
1,The game stinks,The commercials make this toy seem like it is the best one around. False advertising. The butterflies barely fly up through the trunk. The air doesn't blow strong enough. I recommend trimming down the trunk so the butterflies do not have so far to go. I had ours barely a year and I threw it out.
3,"They love it, I think it is okay","This toy is great, my 2 and 3 yr old always want to play with it. But it is a toy you have to play with your kids. Each round ends quickly and then an adult (or older child)has to take the trunk off, everyone can replace the butterflies, then an adult has to replace the trunk. If I am up to it, my kids never seem to get tired of it, but I like toys that allow me to get stuff done around the house. It is great for a family night activity.Very durable (it has been dropped from atop the stairs and my girls once gave the elephant a ""drink of water"" it dried out and still runs great.)"
2,good idea but not good workmanship,"It would actually be a really fun game except that the ""butterflies"" do not blow out of the ""elephant"". I thought the game was defective so I took it back to the store little did I know that the next one was the samething. It needs a stronger fan."
3,Fun is Fleeting,"What a nice toy, for the first time, at least. I bought this toy for my son's 5th birthday, and he couldn't wait to get it out of the box, and turn it on. And then we waited. The fan took forever to get the butterflies out, and After the few butterflies were caught,the fun was over. It came with too few butterflies, it seems in the commercial they had at least 3 to 4 minutes of fun, ours lasted maybe a minute! And once you pack it up and bring it out again, the trunk seems almost impossible for the butterflies to get through again. Great toy for the first or second use, maybe for a birthday party game but in the long run, not a good game to bring out on game night!"
2,Dont bother,"This game is NOT worth $20. My 3 year old and I stood around for 15-30 seconds between each ""butterfly"". I am going to exchange it today... dont waste your money."
3,Elefun,"Well my daughter has been asking for this toy. Now it is a fun game but the air flow is terrible. The butterflies take entirely too long to come out, that my dauther became bored due to the waiting. Also there are not enough butterflies in the game. I also became tired of waiting for the flies to come out of the trunk. We had to shake the machine in order for the butterflies to flow out. This game needs some improvement."
1,Like buying tons of batteries?,"Althought this game appears to shoot out dozens of butterflies every second, we were lucky if we got a dozen to come out at all. This game eats up batteries like no tomorrow. It is worth about a dollar since you will have to replace the batteries everyother time you use it. It is not worth buying since your kids will be sooo disappointed the first time."
3,Not very happy!,"This was a birthday present for my 3 year old son and as far as I am concerned, it is not worth it at all! THe game seems to be over before it starts! The butterflies take forever to come out of the trunk and when they do I would say at least half of them are always left in the bottom after the game is over. I think the fan definetly needs to be stronger! I would not buy this for anyone I know nor would I recommend it to anyone either!"
4,THE KIDLETS LOVE IT,"We just got this toy today, so I cant swear to its durability, but it doesnt look like it is going to fall apart after a couple of uses. I have to say that this looks to be one of my better purchases. My 2 kids a boy-3 and a girl-4 had an absolute blast with this one! We tried only trying to catch certain colors and let me say, A LOT easier said than done. But everyone was giggling and hopping around which means that to me, it just paid for itself. My kids were able to play with this toy for 45 minutes without hitting, pushing, screaming, crying, or fighting the ENTIRE TIME. Elefun DEFINITELY gets my stamp of approval!"
4,Fun for wee tikes!,"My three-year-old son really wanted this for Christmas. Santa did not disappoint, even though I had doubts after reading reviews. As it turns out, we did end up trimming the trunk to allow the butterflies to escape a little faster as others suggested. (Thank you!) This game provided:Fun- It was fun to see his excitement as the butterflies came spouting out again, and again, and...you get the idea.Challenge- The butterflies are surprisingly hard to catch in the air.Exercise- His jumping up and down, both to catch the butterflies, and in anticipation of their appearance, made this a rather physical game, too.Bottom line: It's a little kids' game made fun by their love of repetition. If you can bear that, then this game is worth it. If that drives you crazy, then go with something else."
2,Ele-not so Fun!,I bought this game last year for my 3 an 4 year olds. The trunk on the elephant is flimsy and must be constantly adjusted during the game in order for it to work correctly. the butterflies will only come out if the are flattened so that the air will hit them and unfortunately all of ours seemed to be crumpled and creased. It does not work well on carpet and the butterflies don't fly out of the top hard enough so everyone crowds around the truck to get the next one before it falls to the ground. Frustrating! Disappointing. Buy Hi HO Cheerio instead!
1,disapointing,"we recieved this as a gift, and I just got rid of it. I would not buy it for myself or anyone else. It looks so fun, but is disapointing. We tried two different sets of brand new battries, then realized it was just a weak toy. I had to stand up the elephant trunk with my hands (while it was running) then all of the butterflies come out at once, then if there are any stragglers in the elephant trunk it doesn't have enough blowing power to shoot them out, they just spin around inside. So the kids really have only one shot to catch any butterflies. My kids really like to play with it, but it is frustaring when I have to turn it off, take the trunk off, and re-load the butterflies every five seconds."
4,This game is fun!,"I received this game as a gift when I was younger. I could not believe what the other people had to say about this toy! The butterflies did get stuck sometimes, but we loved to see them fly out! Our young neighbors loved to come over and play with it. The only thing I have to say that is bad about this toy is the truck part was hard to get off and on. It was also time consuming to put all the butterflies back and they would all fly out again. Even though it has some things bad about it, I had a blast with it and I think this toy is worth buying!"
2,Elefun is not so fun...,You have to purchase alot of batteries for this game and they didn't provide enough butterflies. The game is over in three seconds and it takes longer to reload the butterflies.
3,It does what it says it does.,"Bought this for a 3 year old girl for Christmas 2005. We set it up and got it running and she had a ball with it. My 8 year old had fun as well. After about 10 minutes though, it got a little old... you have to fuss with the trunk occasionally and the little things that fly out occasionally get stuck but you just give it a little shake and away they fly!It's a much better option than just sitting around watching TV though. Could also help with gross motor skills for the little ones, or maybe even hand eye coordination.In my opinion it's worth the money. It makes the kids smile and move and well, that's all I was really hoping for when I bought it."
1,NOT much fun!,"I bought this toy as a gift for my 2 year old son who loves sports and anything that requires a bat, raquet, net or stick to play. Even though it is not recommended for his age group, I found that it doesn't really matter since we can't get the thing to work properly!!The fan inside the toy isn't powerful enough to inflate the elephant's trunk, nevermind blow the butterflies up high enough to come out! We were extemely disappointed with this purchase, and can't return it since the box was destroyed by my son in a fit of anger! Don't waste your money!!"
2,Avoid this one unless you have A LOT of spare batteries...,"My 4-year-old son liked this toy a lot, but I finally put it away after the fourth set of batteries. It was good for less than 1 hour of play for each set of batteries - CRAZY!!!"
5,Favorite toy,"I work at a Children's hospital in the physical therapy department. We had this toy in the past and even though it did not last greater than 3 years it was well liked by both therapists and kids. This is a great toy to get kids moving and works on hand/eye coordination. Durability is a problem, but is worth the money for the fun that kids have chasing butterflies. If used in the home this toy should last longer."
2,Waste of money!,"My daughter really wanted this after she saw it in the store so I got it for her birthday. It's a great concept -- if it actually worked the way it's supposed to. She actually has fun with it when we can get the stupid butterflies to come out. The instructions claim they designed it so the majority of the butterflies would come out within two minutes. Well, as I write this, the thing has been running for five minutes straight and has shot out exactly six of the 25 butterflies inside. I can hear the rest swirling around in there, doing nothing. Milton Bradley needs to up the power of the fan and include more butterflies. Also, the nets need to be deeper. They are very shallow and when my daughter moves quickly to catch another one, all the ones she's already caught pop out of the net!"
2,Not so happy holidays.,"Hey Hasbro,Elefun...oh, we had Elefun playing with this thing. :( Trying to swap out batteries because we thought it was weak, then finding out the butterflies were being snagged on the inside of the elephant too. I even tried to adjust the flow by adding a funnel via paper. Output was just as good as the outcome. TERRIBLE.Thanks for working on making 14 different versions of Monopoly instead of working on your other games.I understand that you're there to make money and Monopoly is one of your cash cows, but by all means, stop releasing crap and just be known as the company that has two things. 23098423 versions of Monopoly and 3497583 versions of Mr. Potato head.</3Us."
1,"Like all the other bad reviews, this toy does not work properly.",You turn this on and a few butterflies pop out of the trunk but then the rest just sit in the base and and swirl around. So sad considering this was a birthday gift!! We will be returning this for her to pick out another present!
3,Kids love it but it battery life is VERY poor!,"My 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 year olds love this game however; it goes through batteries like crazy! Each set of batteries we put in it lasts for about 6-7 times of play before the fan becomes weak and slows down...then the kids have to wait and wait for the last several butterflies to ""fly"" out. The only suggestion we have for this game is that it REALLY needs to be made with the option to be plugged in!!"
1,Huge Disappointment,"I purchased Elefun for my young niece for her upcoming birthday. Thank goodness I opened the game and put it together to see how it works. I was completely disappointed because the fan power was only enough to send one or two butterflies out of the trunk at a time, (with lots of time between)if at all. The fan power was not nearly enough to send a burst of butterflies out of the trunk as shown in the pictures on the product box. I feel this product was misrepresented and I would have been embarrassed if my niece had opened it for her birthday. Save your money and buy something else, this game is a huge disappointment."
1,Find a better game,My son just had to have this game for his birthday and we can't seem to get the butterflies out. We have tried several new batteries and following all the instruction by the manufacture. We were very disappointed.
3,Amusing for about 5 minutes,"My girls, ages 3.5 and 2, like this game but it needs a lot of parent supervision. There is a fan which makes the butterflies shoot out of the trunk, however, they can get their hair caught if left on, not ideal! Secondly, the butterflies dont all come out of the trunk, the fan isnt strong enough. Thirdly, the game ends after a minute or two whereby you have to turn the machine off and put all the butterflies back in. It takes more time to set up the game then to play it. My girls did have fun playing it that is why I gave it 4 stars, but there is no educational value unless you decide to count the butterflies or try and catch just certain colors which is virtually impossible to do. Overall I give it 3 stars, not a bad game, but not great either."
2,CUTE BUT DISAPPOINTING,"My 3 yr old received this as a gift he was so excited, it worked fine the first day. Now,(day 3), it takes forever for the butterflies to come out. My nephew also received this as a gift many years ago at age 3, unfortunately they have done nothing to improve it in 10 yrs."
2,Fun doesn't last,When I first turn it on my kids get all excited in anticipation of the butterflies coming out but the fun only lasts for a minute. After the first flurry of butterflies I have to constantly tap on the trunk to get a butterfly to come out. When I check to see if all the butterflies came out there is still a pile of them in there. It's a cute game but the fun is shortlived.
2,Not like commercial,"In between Blue's Clues and Dora the explorer I see this commercial for Elefun. Looks great. REALITY, the nose is not good at staying up on its own and there are not that many ""butterflies"". Pick a different game for your little one."
1,Elephant Game,Do NOT buy this game! My daughter received one and another member of my family received one and it is the worst toy received since my daughter's birth 4 years ago. The fan is not even powerful enough to inflate the trunk let alone blow anything out of it! This is with new batteries too. You have to open up the trunk and wait for one butterfly to come out then wait two more minutes for another. The picture on the box is very deceiving.
4,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","I agree with many of the other reviews. I bought this for my child's 3rd birthday and the motor is just not strong enough to keep the game going. It ""eats"" batteries very quickly which makes it very frustrating for children. Our game is going back to the store as I imagine many will after the holidays."
3,"Elefun? . . .well, to a point.","My twin 3 year old boys love to try to catch the butterflies as they come out. But after all the butterflies burst out in a few quick, full-of-butterflies bursts, it's back to picking all the butterflies back up and putting them back in to start over again. After 3 or 4 runs, the batteries run down and there's barely enough air pressure for one or two butterflies to make it to the end of the elephant's trunk, which truly is a few inches too long and almost has to be cut. The boys have lots of giggles playing this in short spurts before cleaning up the butterflies and then some disappointment when the batteries run out YET AGAIN!! Fun, but it's a high maintenance game!"
1,Huge Disappointment!!,"We bought this game last easter as a gift for our 3 yr. old. The game looked so much fun and we were so excited. It blew the butterflies out one time, then it never worked again. I runs on batteries and the motor sucks the batteries dry immediately. You have to tip the toy to get the butterflies to come out and the box even advises that you ""fluff"" the butterflies up every so often to make sure they come out. We have done everything we can think of to get this toy to work. Eventually, our little girl just plays w/ the butterfly nets to do other things.... Everyone I have talked to has had the same issues w/ this toy as well. This toy is such a heartbreaker. Dont waste your money."
3,BIG MONEY FOR A CHEAPLY MADE TOY,"MY 3 YEAR OLD BEGGED FOR THIS TOY FOR HIS BDAY. WHEN HE FINALLY GOT IT, IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. HE HAD FUN FOR A DAY OR SO BUT THEN GOT BORED. IT IS NOT VERY LONG, THE BUTTERFLIES ARE LIKE TISSUE PAPER SO EASY TO DISTROY. IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM VERY STURDY. THE MOTOR TO PROPEL THE BUTTERFLIES OUT IS WEAK SO SOME TIMES THEY WOULDN'T ALL COME OUT. ALOT OF TIMES THEY ALL CAME OUT IN THE SAME PLACE. IF YOU CAN GET THIS TOY FOR $10 OR UNDER, I'D SAY OK, BUT DEFINATELY WOULDN'T PAY $25 WHICH IS WHAT I PAID. I WILL BE TAKING IT BACK DEFINATELY."
1,Elefun????,"My kids are 3 and 4 years old and they didn't have very much fun with Elefun. They actually got bored waiting for the butterflies. I had to tell them when one was coming so they'd be ready for it. (You can see the shadow of a butterfly coming up the trunk.) This is a brand new toy with new batteries, so it must be that the fan isn't strong enough to push the butterflies out. It seems the butterflies just got stuck inside the trunk. My kids didn't like this toy at all."
2,NO POWER FOR BUTTERFLIES TO COME OUT,THE KIDS HAD SOME FUN AT CHRISTMAS WITH THIS TOY BUT IT SEEMS THE MOTOR THAT BLOWS OUT THE BUTTERFLIES IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH. THEY SOON SHOWED NO INTEREST AFTER WAITING ENDLESSLY FOR THE BUTTERFLIES.
4,Use new batteries.........,"I have read many of the other reviews, and like always, I am not surprised to see what I read. This toy is great. It performs exactly as it is shown on the commercial. My three year-old son loves it, as well as his cousins (who are ages 4, 7, and 12). Sure it is over quickly, but this isn't an adult game made to last an hour- buy monopoly if you want that. The skills gained with this game are great- hand-eye coordination, one-to-one correspondence (counting), and sportsmanship. For all of those who complained about the power, try new batteries."
2,"Lousy and disappointing, until I got ahold of it.","The promise of this game is good. The reality of it is disappointing, as the hundreds of other reviews here will tell you. They're all correct. Rarely does a toy underperform this badly and get away with it for so long. If you already own this toy, or you REALLY want to get it and have it work, I wrote an article on how to hack your Elefun to work the way it ought to:http://xenon.arcticus.com/elefun-hella-fun-hacking-your-elefun-ele-fun-and-profitNow my son and I greatly enjoy playing Elefun. I hope it helps other Elefun owners regain their joy."
2,"dissatisfaction, disappointment","My review is that I accidentally placed a duplicate order.However all attempts to correct prior to shipping which an attempt was made immediately the merchandise was impossible to retrieve with your existing system. The duplicate order was shipped to my winter address which was unoccupied therefore no one in attendance to receive any parcels. Merchandise remained outdoor exposed to the elements of a winter New York. Therefore the merchandise was disposed of, but paid for, upon my return to New York. Consequently, I will no longer recommend or consider Amazon a friendly source of internet shopping"
2,I took it back,"I read the other reviews and I was surprised that most seem to like it. My biggest issue was that the game played very quickly. It took too much time to get it ready for the next round of play than it takes to actually play. The premise for this game is great. But they need many more butterflies and a maybe a way to set it up more quickly. It was really frustrating. I never take back toys that were used, but I took this back and my kids did not miss it."
1,Elefooey,Oh my God; I've never had to put so much effort into having fun! The motor is sooooooooooo slow. My son's hands were tired waiting for the butterflies to finally fly out.It's ridiculous that a toy like this would sell for so much money.Don't buy it. Or keep the packaging so you can return it the next day which is what I'm going to do right now.
2,Poor Product,"Elefun was returned because of it's poor performance. There is a fan inside the unit which causes the ""butterflies"" to fly & it constantly overheats. After it cools down then you can reload all of the butterflies and see if it will work again. The ""fun"" is over quickly as it shoots the butterflies out all at once."
1,"Good idea, bad toy","When we first turned on this toy, some of the butterflies came out a few at a time -- just the way it was supposed to work, and the kids (ages 3 - 6) had fun. But very soon the fan did not have enough power to send the butterflies out. Not one. If you want to change batteries every 15 minutes (4 C-sized) it might be ok... I would like to return it. It's just not a good toy."
3,Disappointing game for the $,"I found this game not to be of great quality. The blower is very weak. The game is not that easy for my almost 4 year old. It does not keep his attention for long at all. Overall, I am disappointed with this game."
3,Fix the Elefun Game,"My son just got the game as a gift. I agree with everyone that the game is slow. My husband performed a ""trunkectomy"" and cut the trunk in half. This seems to have helped the butterflies to come out. For those of you who have the toy and aren't using it, try this method. It's not as tall but for the young ones it works good enough."
4,Fun but quick,"Just like everybody else is saying, the thing is great fun for the 10-20 seconds that it shoots butterflies out. Then you have to collect them all and put them back in. Also, we had to cut the end of the trunk to make it shorter because the butterflies only come out if the batteries are fresh.They should make the fan stronger and make it so that it plugs in. This is a HUGE battery waster. Also, it does NOT come with the batteries.There is a little paradox though, the stronger the battery, the shorter amount of time it takes for the fan to blow all the butterflies out. The weaker the battery, the butterflies last longer but may not come out at all plus the trunk tips over.I think from reading all the reviews and my own experience that this toy would be great with a few modifications."
2,"Fun, if it ever works...","We bought this for our four year old daughter and she literally laughs histerically when she plays it. But the problem is that th motor is not that strong unless you have brand new batteries in it. After they have been used a few times, the motor cuts out. Also, you have to make sure you have it on a hard surface as the bottom being pressed is what makes the motor blow up the feathers. I really think they could have done a better job with this."
2,"Fun game kids, but only for about 2 seconds each time","My kids really enjoy it when the butterflies come out. Problem is that lasts about 2 seconds. Unlike the game leads you to believe, the ""butterflies"" do not float around in the air for very long. As they say ""What goes up must come down"". So if you want to sit there and reload the butterflies (3 year olds would have a hard time doing it themselves) every two seconds, go ahead and buy it."
1,elewaste,"this toy is pretty boring, it takes longer to put the butterflies in the elephant, but the top back on, and then collect the butterflies again after it has blown them out. i think the blowing out of the butterflies happens way too fast, by the time the kids get into the game, the butterflies have all been blow out and it is time to collect them again and begin again.my kids have more fun playing with the nets sans elephant and butterflies"
2,Frustrating!,The game is a good idea but has too many problems. The fan is too weak to blow the butterflies out of the trunk and it goes through batteries too fast. We tried cutting the trunk like some of the other reviews said. It worked a little better but still not worth it. The nets keep coming apart and need to be put back together also.
1,Great idea - Poor design,"While my 3yr old son does like this, it takes a lot of assistance from parents. We have to hold up the trunk to get it started, and then reload the butterflies and start all over again. Ours shoots out butterflies too quickly. I was hoping that the butterflies would glide gently to the ground, but they fall rather fast. My son goes after one, and 2 seconds later there are 20 butterflies already on the ground. I was also hoping that the butterflies would spread out a little more.. Our ELefun shoots butterflies straight up and the butterflies fall straight down landing within inches of the base unit. The game is over within about 5 seconds! I am concerned about the batteries, too."
2,No fun here,"My son received this gift for his third birthday. He loves it, but only because if he turns it on without the trunk attached, the nylon ""butterflies"" fly out all over the room. The battery-operated fan is not strong enough to push the butterflies through the trunk attachment and the nets started to rip apart after just a couple of uses."
4,Was not impressed but now I am.,"I wrote an awful review and I am now revising it because I hate to give up without one more chance. I bought this toy for my 2 and 6 year old granddaughters. I finally got it to work after setting in on a wood floor or on a book on the carpet. I took each butterfly and pressed out the wings with my fingers. Before only 1 was coming out every 2 min (if that). When I pressed them out, they flew out. I did cut off about 6 inches off the trunk which may or may not be for the better. It has now become a fun and workable toy. I still think it could be improved with a stronger fan and maybe more butterflies. It is a great concept. But needs some work."
3,Good idea......but go back to the drawing board,"My daughter who is five loves this game....but her mom (I) hate it. It was her fifth birthday present and thats about how long it lasted. The elephant's trunk is a big pain..it's made of a plastic bag material that she had trouble keeping straight , to keep the air flow constant to blow the butterflies..which lasts all of two minutes...and batteries...4 C's that lasted less than half a day of play...the idea is good but they need to work on it.."
1,Not a Very Good Game,"My daughter wanted this so badly, and she got to play it twice, and the static electricity built up inside so the butterflies would no longer fly out. I returned it for a full refund. Don't waste your money, it's crap."
3,Hasbro could have done better...,"At one year old (granny couldn't read age label) I got this game and it lasted for a half year or so, then no matter how many times we changed the battery, he wouldn't shoot butterflies. Not only that, but the trunk slumped over and I can remember numerous butterflies being torn apart. The butterflies are nothing but a string tied around a piece of cloth. The trunk looks and feels like it's been made out of a trash bag. And whatever happened to the little plastic butterflies used as prizes? Elefun is back, but it's gone downhill."
4,Great Fun for the Kiddies,"We purchased this game about a year ago and all the kids here enjoy playing it ... Ages 3 through 10. It's challenging enough for the older kids to catch the falling butterflies and easy enough for the little ones to gather them up off the floor. We've had great times with this game and it's quick enough that those with short attention spans can finish the game without upsetting the rest who still want to play. I've found that the batteries even last quite a while in this one, which is unusual for games of this nature. The only trouble that I've found with this game is; sometimes the butterflies come out in larger groups rather than a couple at a time."
1,The Butterflies won't come out,"My 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter get bored waiting for the butterflies to come out. One may come out every few minutes.I first purchased the toy for my niece and the mother told me that the butterflies wouldn't come out. I purchased it anyway for my kids, thinking that the parents didn't use the toy properly.I finally called the manufacturer and they replaced the toy, but the new one had the same exact problem.They toy is a great concept, but it is no fun if the butterflies won't come out."
3,Not what they hoped for...,"My kids (7YO, 5YO, 2YO) wanted this really bad. After 5 minutes my 7YO announced she was bored. My 5YO stuck it out for maybe 25 minutes. My 2YO still seems to enjoy it, but she mostly likes to pick the butterflies off of the floor as she can not catch them. Unless the batteries are fresh you spend more time waiting than playing. Once it finally starts you get a puff of butterflies, that last less than 30 seconds, and then for the next several minutes you wait for one butterfly at a time. You constantly have to refill this game which is cumbersome. We have done it so many times that now even my 2YO can load it and switch it on and off. I am glad that my mother wasted her money on this one and not me."
1,Please save yourself the 20.00!,"This is the poorest excuse for a toy I have ever seen. The commercial shows a continous fountain of butterflies overflowing from the elefant's trunk. The reality is you are given barely a handful of these butterflies (very thin, plastic/paper texture) Once you put them in and turn the game on (really just a very low low volume fan) The butterflies barely trickle out and they are all gone in about 10 seconds. The butterflies are so few and far between that my husband and I can barely catch them, let alone our daughter. It takes longer to put your net down, gather up the butterflies, but them in the elephant, put the nose back on, straighten the trunk and then flip the switch than it takes for the butterflies to come flying out. It is much more of a nuisance than it is fun. I wish I would have saved the box and receipt for return. Please don't buy this toy, it is not worth the money at all."
4,Ele - FUN FUN FUN,"I have a 6 year old girl & 3 year old boy. They both Love this game. More butterflies would be APPRECIATED as many others have moted. Game goes VERY VERY quick but my daughter is old enough to set it up, so I do not have to do it over & over. Catching the butterflies is pretty hard for my son but he gets a kick out of it anyway, once I told my daughter to quit counting how many each of them had in their net. I cut some of the trunk off to make it easier for the last ones to make it out - but I may have cut too much so if you try it - be sure to start slow & cut more as needed."
4,Fun toy!,"My 3 1/2 and 18 month old sons love this game. ALL games require time to set up, and in that department this game is minimal. It takes very little time to ""set up"". You have to help the trunk straighten out at first. I agree that after the first 10 seconds the butterflies have a difficult time coming out. But all in all it is a fun and interactive game. Works on hand/ eye coordination, and doesn't scearm songs at you like so many other toys do these days."
2,It was returned,"This was asked for by our three boys 7,4,1,( a game they can all enjoy together), and was a big disapointment. One butterfly would slowly come up and out every minute (or longer..), if at all. We tried several sets of new batteries and it just seems the fan is not strong enough. It would have been a fun game if it had worked at all. It might be worth a try to see if you get one of the good ones. Hopefully the company will improve this game soon."
4,Great Idea- really poor toy.,"The concept behind this toy is fantastic but needs a lot of work. My kids really wanted to play with this toy all day long, however, after just a few short hours the trunk was broken and the fan was dying.Additionally, there needs to be tons more butterflies and the fan needs to actually blow them out!I love the concept of this toy--I sure hope the next model (should they decide to improve on it) spends a lot more time in its beta stage working out the kinks."
1,A waste of money.........,This purchase was the worst. The fan does not blow enough to blow up the trunk or move the butterflies. The kids ages 3 & 5 lost interest real fast. What a waste of money. Would not recommend for any age.
1,Ele NOT Fun,"This is a terrible toy, most of the butterflies do not come out of the elephants snout, they get stuck, and when the occasional one does escape, it doesn't float long enough for a younger child to actually grab it."
2,"a lot of of work, little reward, but my kids like it","Well, my almost 3 yr olds like it but I'm not thrilled with the operation. Much like other reviews we have found it only takes about 30 seconds to play and just as long if not longer to set up for the next round. Most of the time there are about half a dozen butterflies that just refuse to come out, they just spin inside the bottom of the trunk. Not one single time have all of them popped out. It's definitely not a game you can just send your kids off to play. Plan on holding up the trunk and taking it off to reload every time. I think my kids have just as much fun cleaning up the butterflies and putting them back in the elephant as they do trying to catch them."
2,Not as fun as it should be,"My 5 year old received this for Christmas. The first couple of go rounds, it was fun and worked properly. After that, the motor just seemed to lose the ability to work hard enough to move the butterflies out of the trunk. Even with new, fresh batteries.My girls still enjoy playing with the nets trying to catch real bugs out in the backyard but other than that, it sits unused in her room."
1,No Fun Elefun,I got this for my daughter for Christmas. It just doesn't have a strong enough fan built in to blow the very light butterflies up the four feet trunk and out. She loves the idea of the game but gets fustrated cause the butterflies can't make the travel up the trunk. This is not recommended. Nice concept but they need to improve the strength of the fan.
3,Elefun toy review,"A fun toy, although the game is over in a matter of seconds. Found the motor to be too small, the butterflies have a hard time making it up the long trunk, we ended up cutting part of the trunk off and it works better. As someone else mentioned, you spend most of your time setting up for another game. Overall, my son (4) was a little disappointed in this game."
2,"Could be more fun if,.....","this toy has the potential to be a lot of fun for the whole family and kids of all ages. However, we used the alkaline batteries as the intructions suggested, but the fan just doesn't seem to be strong enough to keep the game moving at a good pace. it may start with several butterflies coming out at once, but then you may have to wait a while for more to come out. My 3 yr old loved it but other family members grew tired of waiting between times when butterflys didn't come out. If the manufacturer would remedy that flaw it would really be a fun game for everyone! And really teaches hand/eye coordination."
2,not as great as it appears,"I bought this toy for my three year old and for my three daycare children.We played it the first day and it worked great and they absolutely loved it.However, and this is the bad thing, unless you are willing to put out the money for new batteries each and every time you use it, then don't buy it. The batteries seem wear down after just a half hour of use. I would recomend rechargeable batteries for this toy. I was very disapointed."
1,"Ele ""no"" fun","My son had wanted this toy because the commercial makes it look fun. Well they should call this Ele ""no"" fun because it does not work. The butterflies do not come out no matter what-even with brand new batteries. And the fabric for the nets, and the nets themselves are incredibly flimsy. Save your money and save your child from disappointment by not buying this toy."
1,Ele no fun,"This toy does not work well, even with fresh batteries. The butterflies are supposed to come out in 2 minutes or less, but it takes many, many minutes for just a few butterflies to come out. They often get stuck in the elephant and the motor is not strong enough to push them out."
1,Elefun...better elebored,Only works well when the batteries are brand new. Just after playing for less than an hour the batteries dont propelled the fan with enough speed to make the butterflies go up. I had to cut the trump in half to mafe it more playable. If i had live in the USA I would have return it the same day. Unlucky me!!!
2,Piece of junk,"The trunk will not stay up...so one of my kids has to hold the trunk while the other 3 try and catch the ""butterflies"". The fan isn't powerful enough to actually blow them out and the nets won't stay together to catch a butterfly if it ever DID come out of his trunk. I hate this toy..it was a waste of money and now it's taking up space in his closet.Don't buy it!"
1,eleflop,"Don't waste your time or money!!!! My 3 year old recieved this for christmas. I used brand new batteries, alkaline like they recommended. The following two reviews are a joke (does milton bradley pay people to write good reviews?????). When you turn elefun on a few butterflies come out after about 30 seconds then we waited, like the instructions say, another 30 seconds, another butterfly, about 20 seconds later 1 more and about another 30 seconds later 1 more and that was it. We waited and waited. I tried to shut it off and start over again. we waited about 3 minutes, (mixed up the butterflies as what the instructions said if butterflies don't come out) and nothing came out, I tapped the side and 1 butterfly came out...woo hoo. Then we tried it again a little later and no go. It kept blowing and nothing came out. F- rating 0"
2,How to add more butterflies,"Wish I'd read the reviews first! When it didn't work I went here to see what I could do. We have rechargeable batteries, but I hadn't ""fluffed"" the butterflies. It works a little better. If you take tissue paper cut the same size as the butterflies and twist it in the middle they seem to work just as well as the regular butterflies. They are a little lighter too. Still probably won't be a popular toy in our house. My son who desperately wanted it is already outside playing."
1,THIS WAS A WASTE,THIS GAME WAS A WASTE OF TIME BUYING. IT BLOWS NO BUTTERFLYS MOTOR SUCKS AND WHEN IT DID IT WAS LIKE 3 EVERY 60 SEC. WE TOOK THIS GAME BACK. THIS GAME IS THUMBS DOWN.THE KIDS WERE SO SO SAD AT THIS GAME.
1,No good,"I bought this toy for my daughter who stated it was the only thing she wanted for her birthday. It was fun the two times that we played, but on the third time, the motor wouldn't start. I payed almost 20.00 for the game and 7.00 for new batteries for it. It was definately the shortest amount of fun I have ever paid 27.00 for, and my daughter was sorely disappointed. This toy is junk."
1,Fun idea but it just doesn't work,"Such a disappointment! If the conditions are just right (new batteries, trunk in right position etc.) you might be lucky enough to have half of the butterflies come out... eventually."
1,wasted my money on a piece of junk,"it broke within 10 minutes, it was impossible for my daughter to play with without me reloading it for her every 4-5 seconds, it was simply the stupidest toy I have ever paid money for --- beware!!!!"
3,Arrival,"I purchased it for Christmas Present for my daughter 3 years old, it came nicely packed but the box was kind of over size for the toy original box. I would have saved some money in shipping weight. Will have to wait for the opinion on the toy performance but that is until Dec/25/2006. For that.Stay tuned for response."
1,This toy stinks.,"Don't waste your money. It's cute in idea, but so disappointing in reality. There are so many better toys than this to spend your money on. I'm taking mine back today."
1,Overall - A total waste of time and $,"I bought this game for my 2 and 4 yr old sons. It's cute, but time consuming for the parent.It takes about 2 minutes for all the butterflies to be airborn, and be caught or hit the floor, ending the game and the fun. It takes roughly 3 minutes to disassemble the toy, reload the butterflies and reassemble it, so they can play again. With the whining to ""hurry"" it will feel more like 10 minutes.Summary: You will be reloading butterflies in this toy every 2-3 minutes until your child/ren get/s bored or you make them quit playing because have other things to do besides reloading the butterflies."
1,Not worth the money!,We bought this toy for our two and three year old. The trunk would not go up and becuase of that the butterflys would not do the same. We returned it the same day.
3,"OK game, but a lot more work than it's worth","My 3 year old daughter got this game for her birthday and was quite excited about playing. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because she likes to play the game. I have pretty much the same issues as all the other reviewers:1.Trunk has to be extended manually by an adult.2.All the butterflies come flying out at once so the game is over in about 2.3 seconds.3.Because of the fact all the butterflies come out so fast, it is hard for my 3 year old to catch anything at all (leading to frustration). By the time she sees the direction they are heading, they are on the floor and ready to be picked up again.In conclusion,it's an OK game that could definately be improved upon."
2,Fun for them not for me!,"This game is fun and exciting for ten seconds, then mom has to open the big head, help with refilling, hold up the over sized trunk because the fan can't do it. Then ten seconds of fun again. This toy was a great idea, but it needs to be designed properly and made more kid friendly. Also, my 3 year old twisted then wrapped the trunk around his neck. I know he is very imaginative in his attempts of self injury, but if he could do it, so could yours."
2,Not for mixed age groups.,"We bought this game last Christmas for our 3 and 5 year old. It takes a while for the butterflies to come out and then they all sort of come out together. They are so slow that our 5 year old just held his net up at the top of the ""trunk"" while his much shorter brother was very frustrated not getting any come down to his level. We gave it to charity after a few months."
2,Poor purchase,"Toy was purchased for my three year old daughter. I thought the game would be great for play dates but quickly proved to be a poor purchase. The fan operates well on fresh batteries but quickly runs down the batteries thereofore leaving many butterflies at the bottom. When you do replace the batteries the butterflies come out too fast for the children to catch them. It becomes a struggle of keeping batteries, butterflies moving and children happy. After three rounds of catching butterflies my daughter and her friends become bored and ask what else does the elephant do? To the consignment store this game will go."
1,"good idea, bad execution","In addition to all the previous complaints (poor fan, not enough/too heavy butterflies, trunk too long, battery hog) I'll add one more: the nets are poorly constructed, the fabric snags on everything (including winter dry skin!) and the loops break like breadsticks. Not at all suited to active, excited children. A burst of butterflies and adrenaline and then little else. Save your money."
3,I like it more than my son does,Thought would be a fun toy for my 3 year old and that it would help him with coordination and motor skills but he is not very interested. My 18 month old nephew is more into it. My child prefers to watch others play with it.
3,Elefun,"Great game for eye and hand coordination skills.Not all of the ""butterflies"" come out of the elephant. You have to always fluff up the ""wings"" before putting it back into the elephant. Also, the trunk of the elephant always needs help in standing straight up. My children aren't tall enough to reach the top of its trunk - so if it's a game they're playing on their own - they always need assistance with that."
4,Elephant Butterflies,"I saw the Hasbro Elefun advertised on television before Christmas and thought it would be an interesting toy for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loves it! She can take the top off and put the butterflies back in all by herself. This game received so much play time the first day that the batteries had to be replaced. That is my only complaint, that the batteries expire quickly with extended use."
3,not bad but---,"I really like this author,have read all of his kindle books, but this one, although not bad, could have been better. The first quarter of the book really dragged, and then, all of a sudden, there was just too much going on and it just became incredibly unbelieveable and confusing.I also have a legitimate question. I pre-ordered ""The Last Minute"" last October to be delivered to my Kindle sometime in July--price $11.99. Last week I found it on my Kindle,immediate availability for$9.99. I had to go into my amazon account and cancel the pre-order. This has also happened with books by James Patterson. What gives? I am a very good amazon customer and I hate being ripped off."
4,A plausible page turner,"An intelligent read with a plausible story...it's always a plus if you can actually believe the plot. Sometimes with the kind of thriller (book or film) where the main character doesn't know where to turn, I find myself getting frustrated as they continually make the wrong decisions but that doesn't happen here.Evan is thrown into confusion when his mother is murdered and he very nearly suffers the same fate. The author successfully portrays Evan's confusion at not knowing who to trust...when the people closest to you don't appear to have been who you thought they were and your life is in serious danger, how do you decide who to believe?I liked the characters, and I also liked the fact that the author wasn't afraid to dispense with some of the good guys along the way."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I have to say I bought the book from a gift shop, so I wasn't exactly expecting Nobel prize material; I had a few hours to kill. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked this book. It had a supportable plot and tied in espionage, betrayal, trust... Granted it may read like a book you read on the beach, but that's the kind of book this is. Fairly interesting. Along the lines of Carre's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. I recommend it."
2,JEFF ABBOT GOES HOLLYWOOD,"This book works as a script. The plotting is tight. The twists keep you turning the pages. It continues Abbot's obsession with missing mothers and mysterious fathers all bound together by the love of a son. Abbott is consistent. Once again, he has a character ""tent his cheek"". You can see the movie. Redford as the father. A cameo by Sarandon as the mother. Some flashbacks. Toby Maguire as the protagonist. For consistent chemistry, lets toss in Ms. Dunst as the love interest. And that is the problem. Jeff Abbott knows better. And writes better. Where is the thought and the heart that has made my Judge Whit Mosely my favorite jurist? Where are the characters, the people, good and bad, with whom Mr. Abott has taken our imaginations in his past efforts? Gone to Hollywood it appears. That is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a let down for this reader."
1,Enough...,"you'll say, at some point before the end, when you realize it's not going to get better, and Whit Mosley isn't around. Plausibility does not exist here. A bad 50's conspiracy thing. Save your time."
4,Good reading,"This book is a good chronicle about Strother's life (especially the early years), although after a while the tone of the book gets too much into the ""holier than thou"" side. Plus, he didn't have as much to write about consulting work he did in the 80s and 90s. Still, it's a good read."
3,A little disappointing,"I thought this would be something nice to do with my little pup, who is two years old now. A lot of the pages are neat and interesting, but the book itself doesn't seem well thought out enough. A good portion of the book is pretty much ""Here, do it yourself because we don't know what to put here,"" for all the various holidays and such. I didn't think it was well organized, and a lot of the questions just didn't apply to my dog. I'm still relatively happy I bought it, because it gives me ideas to make my own, better book like this."
5,DeBroff Knows Moms! This is a great book!,"I have been a DeBroff fan ever since her first organizer for moms came out a few years ago and her new book brings us more great ideas consolidated into one book! I am an experienced and very busy mother of three, with a husband who is never at home and I have yet to find a topic Ms. DeBroff investigates without coming up with some new tricks to try. To Disappointed, who gave the two star review, I've BEEN there -- with two kids in diapers and a dog who needed a diaper, worked too hard and been super organized and still can't do it all -- DON'T BLAME IT ON THE BOOK -- you need some girlfriend time, or just chat with some other moms while you have the kids with you if you can't arrange to go out alone.THIS BOOK WILL BE A GREAT HELP TO MOMS EVERYWHERE, ..., MAKE IT A COFFEE TABLE BOOK FOR THE Moms of the Under 12 set."
5,Fabulous Resource!,Stacy DeBroff did it again - what a wonderful book! There are tips covering every topic you could imagine and then some. The book has a great layout - mom stories break up bulleted tips. I learned hints that I would never have thought of -- plus reading the experiences of moms from all walks of life was very comforting. I've already given the Mom Book as a gift to a friend of mine - she loves it too! Keep up the great work Stacy - I look forward to your next book!
2,Find it online for free,This isn't anything new.I have read the same old tips online for years.A disappointment.Mother of 3
4,good but not great,"It fits my 2215 very nicely and is very sturdy but I do have a few small complaints. It doesn't make a tight seal and everytime I pull it out I have to wipe lint off of the screen. Also, it has a slot for an extra SD card (great idea) but when I had a card in it it would scratch up the screen (don't use it anymore). Fortunately I had a skin on the screen but still a bummer. Also, I've had it for a few months now and the cover is starting to get loose (and it's never been dropped). I may use it more than most but I wish is was a little better made. Still, it's better than fabric."
1,Dont waste your time,"Having just finished this book id say-dont bother.Pulp fiction at its dreary worst,definetly for those who enjoy gratuitous mindless trash.Characters so stereotyped or simply detestable,the whole thing leaves you cold.I read this as a 'rest' between books of quality but why do i bother with modern populist bilge.Try Umberto Eco if you want modern quality or even Patricia Cornwell:ill stick to my Dickens,Nabakov,Dostoevsky,Joyce thanks all the same-and to think that a awriter like this might make a living producing 'writing' like this.Wow."
2,Very limited coverage of Windows Forms,"This may be a decent book for someone wanting to learn the rudiments of programming (and they just happen to be using VC++ .NET) but it is of very limited use for anyone at the intermediate level or above. I bought the book hoping it would serve as a guide to transitioning from traditional C++, but its treatment of graphical programming was at the very end and of little value."
2,got what i wanted,"i purchased this cd for two songs only, as i was making a cd for myself of memorable songs from my high school years."
3,Now we're getting somewhere,"As someone who is watching the show for the first time, I've felt it's been in something of a slump ever since Victoria returned from 1795 and the Adam storyline began. Robert Rodan did what he could with the Adam character but the Frankenstein plot bordered on the ridiculous at times. This sequence was rescued primarily by the performance of Humbert Allen Astredo, one of the better actors to appear on the show, as Nicholas Blair.Now things are picking up again, with the journey back to 1897 just around the corner and the surprisingly complex Quentin Collins plot. I have mixed feelings about Don Briscoe, who plays Chris Jennings, and the less we see of Roger Davis the better... but the show is finally getting back to that ""can't put it down"" pace that keeps me watching three to six episodes at a sitting.And it gets even better in the next set!"
5,Dark Shadows DVD Collection 12,"For the technology that they had for the period of time, the acting was excellent, the storylines are exciting and I can't wait to get to the next collection. I love them as much now as I did when I was a young teen. I would recommend them to anyone whether you've seen them when you were young or not. But, if you've never seen them, I do recommend you start from the very beginning...collection # 1."
2,Where The Show Gets Exciting,"To me this is where the show begins to show some excitement. While it has been fantastic up til now, It is on the verge of going back into time the second and third time. Barnabas and eventually Julie will show up. The Show also begins to develop something entirely different where before it has been on the same theme that was getting old. Barnabas begins to develop not as an evil Vampire, but as some one who cares for his family. Every One that liked Dark Shadows should really enjoy the changes that are beginning"
5,Talk about great music...,"As a fan of non-mainstream rap, this CD represents every thing I love about underground rap. Once I listened to this CD for a month, it was the only thing lying in my cd player. Top two rap groups I've ever heard next to Talib Kweli. Beats and lyrics are amazing. Some great songs are: You Never Knew, Oakland Blackouts, At the Helm, Off the Record, and many more. I would encourage anyone that is a fan of rap to listen to this EXTREMELY GREAT rap group. Nothing I can say to tell you how good it is without you listening to it."
5,"""Oakland Blackouts"" is the tightest song on the CD.",This CD is full of rhymes no one else could ever think of. They also have the phatest beats too.
5,A Classic,"This is the album that turned me onto to what real hip hop is all about. It is 21 tracks of some of the greatest rap every made(it would be 22 but the last track's beat is just plain annoying and is out of place). If you are tired of Ja Rule and all of the other fake MCs clouding the airwaves, then you must purchase this album. It will completly change your view on what rap is and what it can be. After listening to this album, you will want to turn of MTV, BET, the radio, or whatever what form of media you use to listen to music and bump this CD non-stop for months. It is just that great. Stop listening to [others] and experience what real hip hop is about."
5,Classic hip hop album,"Pretty much flawless album, with oustanding tracks in between good ones. Each emcee's solo track is well done, and adds an interesting flavour to the album. The only disappointments come when tracks such as the who remix and the last one remix are nowhere to be found, because they are amazingly dope in their own right. Every tracks bumps. Don't front, buy this right now"
4,This CD is the best buy you'll make.,"I bought this CD because I had heard two songs on the new snowboard vid ""Technical Difficulties"". This absolutely rocks, I'm not really into the rap stuff nowadays, but this is totally different. Like they say, they're trying to make something better, and this definately is! If you like this, also try Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and The Roots."
2,Very dissapointing,I was just overall very dissapointed. I tried to make myself listen to this album but I could only do so a couple times before I gave up. I thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer Kool Keith or MF Doom or Gang Starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists.
5,One Of The Last Of True Hip Hop Groups around,"A must have in any premier hip hop collection. If you ain't knowin' about the Hiero, you ain't knowin'! Fasho!"
5,Great gift for a fan of underground music,"I bought this as a gift for my friend and it was a great decision. Hieroglyphics are awesome and you will not be disappointed with you purchase of this cd, great addition to any collection. Look up their other cd's too, full circle in particular is good."
2,not worth the money,Not worth the money. Some of the animals are cute but not really meant to be cuddly toys which is more what i wanted.
4,An easy start to knitting stuffed animals!,"This book is a great way to get started knitting stuffed animals. This book has easy to follow instructions and drawings of what the finished parts look like before assembly. The animals are all between 4-7 inches long. I had knit scarves before, but never anything much more complicated. I knit my first project- the sheep- in about 3 hours. And it was very cute! The little dog I knit for my second project was spunky and sweet looking at the same time. My one complaint is that I can't quite figure out how the tummies of the animals are supposed to be formed during the assembly- if you follow the directions exactly, you wouldn't be able to stuff the legs through the tummies. To fix this, I made little knit swaths (1 x 3 inches) to form the tummy. But this is an easy fix!I would recommend this to anyone interested in making small-scale stuffed animals."
2,Need better instructions,"Cute but the instructions are far from complete.I've tried the ducks and lamb and have been frustrated by both.For example the duck is made by two rectangles one for body and one for head. Instructions for head merely says to sew it up and make it round as possible. How??Then make the beak with over lapping buttonhole stitch. Huh? I know how to do buttonhole stitch on cloth but how to do it from yarn - no clue anywhere.How do you sew up the lamb's head to be shaped like a lambs head? No mention at all of the head in the sew up instructions.There are cute pictures, but for this price someone should have tested the patterns."
1,Not even close.,I Loved Strawberry Shortcake as a child And this is just not her. She is To skinny and her hat and clothes are to different not happy at all.
4,my little ballerina,my little ballerina loves this doll. she takes this & my little pony everywhere w/ her. i glad it was brought back i loved these toys as a child. it's great that my daughter is growing up w/ the same toys i did. now they can hold a specail in both our hearts.
5,I love Strawberry Shortcake,Although the clothes have changed the dolls are still cute. I fell in love all over again and ordered every doll. I can't wait to add Huckleberry Pie and Blueberry Muffin to my collection. I recommend Strawberry Shortcake to everyone no matter what age. I'm so happy my daughter is able to enjoy her as much as I did when I was little.
5,Follow Chip from one adventure to another,"Easy reading. The characters are well developed and the descriptions were so detailed, you'll swear you can smell the aroma of strong cajun coffee perking. The hilarious interaction between the Federal Government, The Louisiana State Government, the Cajuns and the New Orleanians. The wheeling and dealing and looking the other way. I felt like I was following ""Chip"" and on several occasions I was afraid he would end up as ""white bones in the reeds"". An armchair trip to cajun country."
3,Great at first ............ But then !,"Wore these recently and found them to be fine for the first 3-4 hours then the foot area seems to react to (maybe sweat) and the hose becomes slightly rouger and more irritable.I wore mine with slides and had to retun home after 3 hours to change.I found that Hanes silk reflections did not have the same problem and look every bit as good.With wearing slides I had to drive without them, in this respect there was no problem on the outward trip but when returning to change the irritation did make me wear my slides again. Hanes did not have this problem."
3,worth the price,"worth the 7 bucks i paid for this.i wouldn't pay more then $10, though.the good:-inexpensive,-don't snag or run easily,-stayed upthe bad:-""nude"" is still too tan for me,-the nylon has started to separate from the lace top,-stay-put rubber on the lace starts to itch/burn after sitting for a bit,-instead of mid-thigh, the lace starts at just above the kneeoverall: i won't buy them again only because of the itch/burn on the thigh,but i would say, it's worth you to try for the low cost."
2,Not as long as some,"If you're the kind of person who has trouble with slippage these are great. They stay up really well, but they are definitely for people with thinner thighs, and they are shorter in length than some other brands. I prefer thigh highs that come up a little higher on the leg - and I'm only 5'4"" so they won't be very high on people with longer legs, but if you're the sort of girl who likes a little lace to show, then by all means go for it!"
5,the most comfortable stockings i've ever owned,"these are great stockings, the stay up silicone has 5 strips that insure they will not fall down. i often wear them under my jeans or pants and its hard to pull up stockings so thats why i love this brand."
4,The best dictionary for Telecommunication and computing,Less than nine months ago I started working for a software company that makes OSS/BSS solutions for Telecommunication operators.As an economist I had a lot of problems understanding the sector and the acronyms that telecommunication people love to use. Having this dictionary at hand did definitively help me a lot. I do recommend it to every person wanting to get a general understanding of the sector. Only a pity that Harry did not include more graphics to help with the explanations.
3,false advertizeing,they showed the wrong cover for the comic but they did their best to try to make things right in the end they gave me my money back and still let me keep the comic. this is one of the best dealers i have delt with on here over comics
4,A good product.,It is a good product to have just a little hard to get the right programming for window vista. Gotta look for it other than that it works great.
4,It is what it is.,"Its a bowling ball with spots. If thats what you want, then buy this. My mom's favorite animal is the cow, so she loves this ball. Average ball, good appearance if you are into cows or possibly dolmations."
4,Where it all began,"Hip Hop meets Dub. Music in constant evolution. Some will argue that everything's been done before and that new artists are nothing but skilled plagiarists. Others will concede that it's not as easy as it seems to juggle with different genres and come out with a coherent whole. The latter category will certainly dig Le Peuple de l'Herbe's witty fusion. Of course, there's more to it than just dub and hip hop, the Lyon collective adds some ragga, funk and electro for good measure creating a sound that only belongs to them. Sure, the band will later come with even tastier music but it's always good to see where the sound comes from and, when it's as good as it is on Triplezero+, there's no reason to indulge ourselves in some mindless booty-shaking. A nice album from start to finish."
1,One actually broke,"The second time we used these one of them bounced off the front of the wood frame for one of the pits and broke in two. They were not worth the $18 I paid for them, certainly not worth the $35 they are currently listed for."
5,Some of the best songs ever created,"I was a little nervous ordering this CD because Amazon didn't list the artists, just the titles. They are the well-known artists providing us with a fabulous compilation.Here are just a few examples:Shadow of Your Smile: Nancy WilsonWalk on by - Helen ShapiroI Wanna Be Loved: Ricky NelsonCan't Get used to Losing you: Bobby DarinAnd I love you so: Helen ReddyJulie London - Chances AreKeely Smith Fools Rush InJackie Deshannon: What the World Needs NowDinah Shore: I've got you under my skinTimi Yuro: HurtFor once in my Life; Matt MonroeAl Martino: Love Is BlueTony Bennett: Lady is a TrampDick Haymes: Very thought of youJo Stafford: You belong to meMatt Monro: Strangers in the NightNat King Coe: Too YoungAll of me: Frank SinatraDean Martin: I'll Always Love you"
4,Flashing Phenomena,"I think for better understanding to learn about Nuclear Power Plant System (NPPS), we must learn first about Boiling and Two-phase flow as an important part of thermohydraulics system in NPPS"
2,Not very durable,"I not very happy with the product but it is not because of where I bought it is just the durability of the product. I have a pickup truck that I use on the weekends for part time work which consist of hauling loads of all shapes and size. The 2 issues of have with this bar is that if you have an insert bed liner it just doesn't work, without the extra ratchet method of securing the bar you just cannot get a good secure lock. Second the simple twist method of locking just does not give you a good secure lock. So far I have always be satisfied with all the vendors working through Amazon.com so I am going to try to return the bar and purchase a different one. if not I might just give it to a friend or family member that has maybe a SUV that might be able to use it for hanging clothes or a similar application. Ok for light duty work.."
5,Super Shooter,It shoots one big ball of water and a couple tiny drops of water about 10 feet. It is easy to shoot and leaks as much as a super Soker. It is very fun!
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SOAKED!!!!! ITS TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!ITS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!DOESNT WORK!!!!!!!,"(...)ITS NO FUN,IT BREAKS DOWN AFTER 1 DAY,ITS NOT EDUCATIONAL AT ALL!!!!!!!WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD USELESS HUNK OF PLASTIC(...)"
2,Money down the drain...,"The info on the package made it seem interesting enough to try it out. I bought the ""dual"" version, that supposedly shoots out two balls. It does shoot out two balls of water but instead of shooting out at the distance needed to compete with a Super Soaker, it gently lobs two small balls of water about 13 feet (this figure assumes you were aiming at a person's foot, there is no way you could hit a torso from 13 feet away with this silly thing). It did make me laugh, even though my shirt was soaked because you have to hold it against your body to fire it and it leaks like a hyperactive Pomeranian. I would never, in a million years, bring this thing into battle. My advice is to stick with the good 'ol Super Soakers. Let me know when the Waterball Launcher becomes pressurized and can hit a target a hundred feet away."
2,Garbage,"This toy is a piece of garbage.When you fire one of these ""waterballs"", even if you hold the toy exactly how they say it, it only travels a maximum ten feet. Secondly, the balls of water are only the size of a quarter, not even. Third, when you pull back the large uncomfortable lever to launch a waterball, it makes a large vibration noise, with a volume level as high as a table falling from the sky to the ground. Last, it leaks all over the place! There are two holes on the bottom of the launcher driven right through the plastic that have plastic ties in them to hold the waterball launcher to the packaging. When you cut the ties to remove the waterball launcher from the packaging, the holes are still there, and when you fire a waterball, it leaks ALL over the place through those holes. I mean, you lose a half a tank just firing three waterballs. It leaked ALL over my shirt and pants, to my shoes, creating a massive puddle in my driveway.My advice to you; buy a Super Soaker."
1,"Neat, but nothing in a fight","I thought this was fun for the first day I had it, but even then it was not as good as I expected. The waterball (more like a water marble) is only a centimeter in diameter. Don't be fooled by the size of the opening. It is also very noisy. I thought (after I saw the range and size of the waterball) it might be good for close range attcks. You can shoot fairly rapidly, but if your opponent had any water gun at all, they would beat you. It has a good water capacity and does not leak, but it is difficult to fill up and doesn't stand a chance in a fight."
1,dumb and stupid,"this is the dumbest water gun u can ever buy, Im intrested in paint balling so I tryed it cause I thought it shot balls with water inside but it shoots drips of water! super soakers r waaaaaaay better cause they actually shoot a stream"
1,All wet,"I saw a write up on this toy in June's Maxim magazine and thought it sounded like a pretty cool toy. So when the toy store near where I work got some in I figured I'd go and give them a whirl. After work I got it all loaded up and found a reasonable target 20 feet away and started firing. I failed to hit the target by about 5 feet. I was pretty disapointed. The review I had read made them sound so great and yet they failed to perform to the same level as a Super Soaker, it's most obvious competitor. The waterball projectiles are small, about half the size of a regular M&M. It would take a lot of pumping to soak someone with one of this guys. The design has a lot of potential though."
4,A Lot of Fun for a good Price.,"I purchased 2 of these and this is a great toy. It shoots a waterball a good 7-9 feet depending on the angle of the shot and it doesn't hit hard. Smaller kids (under the age of 5) will have some difficulty handling it since it does require 2 hands. It seems well built enough and for the price should last a good lond time. I took it on vacation and it works great in pools. I was the victim of a few drive-by waterballs in the hotel room but since I had another gun, I got even."
1,waterball guns are defective!,"I had bought one of these water guns and was sadly dissappointed because my gun was leaking. I took the product back thinkingthere was something wrong with this SINGLE gun.My next gun... the very same problem.I strongly suggest not purchasing this product because not only does it have bad accuracy and range, but is a defective gun."
2,THIS GUN...,at first i thought that a gun that shoots water balls would be cool but the gun can only shoot a maxx distance of 10-13 feet. the gun also leaks and the water balls are tiny. if you want a good water gun your better off getting a monster xl. but in other words this gun [is bad].
1,You'll have more fun taking it back then actually using it..,It's a piece of [poop]!It shoots 5 little drips of water instead of a ball.... and the distance [stinks]...! I tried to shoot my mom with it from one side of the kitchen to the other and i made it not even half way. DO NOT waste your money.... and if it goes down in price dramatically DO NOT waste your money still. It's not pumped either.... you just pull back a lever and a spring loaded barrel shoots it out... so if you use your common...sense! you'll know metal and water equals rust! It's loud...too!
3,Do Astronaunt Scratch?,"This is a fact filled book, its true, but in my opinion its poorly written to keep my teen engaged like the Uncle John Trivia readers. (Which my teen loves and can't put down! Isn't that what we are looking for?) I think the books would be way more successful if it was arranged better into categories for quick bites, not just plowing through hoping to find your interest in between things you yawn at. Its best suited for adult readers. Could be good for people stuck somewhere and have uninterrupted time and maybe want to wow bystanders with unknown facts. I recommend the better written and more fun trivia books like the Uncle John Trivia books. Maybe someone will get smart and merge the two; more info for Uncle John and more readability for Feldman."
3,Its fun to read,"I only rated this three stars because it is fun to read but once you are finished it just collects dust. Most of the stories are interesting but some are just boring. Overall, I don't regret buying."
2,Not what I expected,I don't care for this flea comb. It is ok to use as a regular comb for a short haired dog. I have a regular small tooth metal one that I purchased from vet and it works. This one doesn't. I wanted an extra to keep in the car for his encounters at the dog park. This isn't something I would recommend.
3,The other books were better,"I have to say I was really excited when I finally got the book. But when I finished reading it, I thought that this book didn't fit with the ones before it.Too me it wasn't as creative or unique. Sure it has more people added to it, but it didn't really add what Claidi was suppose to do; she just needed to find Argul and possibly find out about her heritage.Now we know shes just a plain old jane whose parents were house workers. I bet the next book will talk about how Claidi parent's are important and stuff......it seems like the next typical thing that could happen."
2,Lee Should Have Stopped With Book One,"Although the first book in the Claidi Journals, Wolf Tower, is one of my favorites, I was deeply dissapointed in the rest of the series. Especially Wolf Queen. I can't imagine why Tanithe Lee chose to continue on with two more books after Wolf Tower. It's one of the best books I've ever read, it's well written, and had a conclusion after chapters of suspense. There was absolutely no point in digging up the story and completely twisting it around. The second book was bad enough, but the third was horrible. While well written, Wolf Queen completely clashed with the first two books. It reworked all the characters and seemed to make changes in the plot merely for the sake of change rather then the story. I strongly suggest you stop after book one."
2,A Card Collector's Point Of View,"I would say that this is just a basic pack of 11 cards. It may help or not with your collection, but you really have to know what cards are in it to see how good it is. But I collect cards myself. I'm trying to get 100 different kinds of Harry Potter cards. So far I only have 61."
5,A REALLY RAUNCHY READ FROM OLD LONDON TOWN,"This second instalment of the fictionalised autobiography of two Edwardian era upper crust teenage girls - Gerry Newman and Anna Cooney - is perhaps even more explicit than the first book in this hugely entertaining bawdy narrative which till now has only been available to academics in the British Library in London. The girls crammed their real-life experiences into a diary of our heroine, nineteen year old Lady Katie Tottenham. The authors exhibit a boundless energy as they throw themselves into a variety of lusty sexual escapades with both boys and girls. Without doubt, this lively and at last uncensored tale will delight all lovers of historical erotica."
3,Got Lull?,"""Blue"" and ""Slunk"" are typical of Corgan's early Gish-era music, wet with guitar bends. ""Rhinoceros"" is mellow, and also the EP's strongest. The acoustic ""Bye June"" passes for a weak B-side at most. There is more significance in this song alluding to June than to it being music. Daphne and Ruby are fuming. For Pumpkins fans, Lull is enjoyable, although not a must-have. Strictly speaking music, however, Lull doesn't cut it."
5,smashing pumpkins / nuff said !!!!!!,"i bought the cd a couple of days ago , but i listen to them all the time ,my favorite song by the pumpkins is Cupid de Locke , that song is so awesome and i love the poem at the end ,no one could say that poem better than Billy Corgan i reccommend you buy this cd and any smashing pumpkins cd. my favorite song on this album is rhinosorus it reminds me of my girlfriend.sincerely justin lowe"
5,Smashing Pumpkins - Lull,"I bought this single quite some time ago on cassette and have been looking for it on CD for a LONG time now. I finally bought it a few weeks ago from Amazon and I'm completely satisfied. There are four songs total on this single and they're all worth it. You're really only looking at two new songs, ""Slunk"" and ""Blue."" You can find an alternate version of Slunk on either the ""Viewphoria"" VHS or DVD, or,the ""Earphoria"" CD. That however is a live version, this one is of demo quality but definitely a studio version. As for ""Blue,"" it's definitely a demo, but, still worthwhile. All in all, if you're a huge Pumpkin's fan and you must have everything, this is worth your time, if you're just curious about the band, I would start with their major releases and go from there. In my opinion however, even though it's the same studio version as on Gish, Rhinoceros makes this album a good choice."
5,Star Booty Rockz,wow thiz product came in tha mail fast n in very good condition...i will soooooooooooo be buyin fr thiz dealing again.
4,trashy fun,"I can't recommend this for everyone but if you like funny, outrageous films and like to watch these with friends, you ought to like this one. It really is very John Waters-ish if John Waters somehow convinced Diana Ross or Pam Grier to be a part of one of his films. I love anything with RuPaul in it, so this was fun for me."
1,Disappointing,"Disappointing - Ru Paul is an amazing and talented entertainer, and this movie did not showcase that great talent. It felt contrived through much of the movie - and the editing was DREADFUL! The story, the actors... the potential is all there... but the result was just plain disappointing.Such a shame."
5,How to Prepare for the Pentecost,"Well written, years ago, so it's a bit difficult to understand, however it is straight forward on disciplining ones life to improved communication with God."
1,Misleading,"This book is misleading it creates a view of ""entrepreneurship"" that is empirically unsupported. It uses pseudo-scientific data and applies it to social phenomena, ignoring concepts like born-privilege and socialization.Evolutionary psychology and similar disciplines are helpful in understanding root drives and certain human universals, but when it comes to explaining how some people succeed and others don't, it proves to be useless and oversimplified.This is not a good book, and I only recommend reading it if you want to understand how to exploit science in order to argue favor of class difference.This book is just an apologia for social Darwinism."
1,"""Don't waste your time and money""","This is not even a ""feel good"" book: it hurt just to read one chapter. After one chapter I was trying to recall why I ever considered ordering the book. I thought this book was going to give me some additional insights into the Big Five Model of Personality or at least that was what the promo said. The book is so bad that I won't even reserve any space for it in my book case."
3,Insightful...but a Bit Stuffy.,"I am a voracious business book reader, and the one quality I value above all else in this genre is its ""easy-to-read"" factor. I don't like having to read something more than once, as I feel that I should be able to absorb it the first time I read it.Instinct does not have the easy flow that I usually look for in a book, however, I do have to keep in mind Mr. Harrison is a trained biologist. The information is highly insightful, and incredibly on point. I do recommend this book as a valuable addition to anyones leadership library. However, I do forewarn that it's not the kind of book you ""can't put down""."
5,Science grounds this title from generic prescriptiveness,"Harrison sandwiches his entrepreneurial lessons firmly between hard science and qualitative anecdotes, avoiding the over-obvious 'duh factor' of most business titles. He manages to keep the narrative flowing and free of formulaic panaceas to all of life's ills.The lessons comfortably adapt to individual personalities and reassure the reader in being the best of themselves versus 'like me'. By the end of Instinct, you'll certainly have gleaned at least a few tricks to sharpen yours.And you'll sleep better knowing nice guys can finish first."
4,Such a rich voice,"Ms. Herdman's voice is so rich and lovely. Her selections of songs on this CD is varied and delightful. The harmonies are well done, and the accompaniment is perfection. I don't have children, although I teach. and find this CD can mellow a room, and bring children to quite conversation without any effort on my part. They love to sing along, as do I."
5,a bedtime classic,"Every new mommy and daddy needs this cd in their collection. Priscilla Herdman created these(Star Dreamer)collections for her own little one. Her lovely voice is so comforting and she has just the right accompanyment to round them out. They were a bedtime favorite for my little girl's entire childhood. She is a teenager now and still listens to them when the world is crashing down on her. You can't do wrong with this, I actually owned this before I was married, let alone a mommy."
5,Buy this CD!,This album will enchant both the child and the parent. A must-have for all!! Don't pass up an oppurtunity to hear such a beautiful collection of songs sung by an equally amazing voice.
2,Music to Put You to Sleep,"I'm a children's librarian, so I listen to and review a lot of children's music as part of my job. Priscilla Herdman's voice is better than most children's singers' because she avoids that goofy cute sound so many children's singers have. Her voice has the same clear, high quality that her fellow folksinger Judy Collins has.However, in all honesty, I have to say this album is pretty dull. We have it in our library, but the children don't check it out. I think, this is because the song selection doesn't appeal to them. The songs just aren't ""catchy."" A parent might be able to use this album to put a child to sleep. Whether this is because the songs are soothing, or merely boring is the question."
4,Hand Helper,I ordered this item for my wife. She had a stroke an needs therapy on her left side. This exercizer has helped her get her left arm & hand stronger. With the rubber bands you can adjust the tention real easy as the patient progresses. I think it's a good piece of equipment.
4,AN IN-DEPTH ESSAY ON A MUCH DEBATED ISSUE,"At last scholars count with an in-depth and inquisitive essay on the much discussed issue of the ""Rejiut""- or ""Lapwing""-people in ancient Egypt. This group of people(s) was firstly identified as the lowest class of Egyptian society in times of the pharaohs, but the present research demonstrates that this is a false and wrong presumption: the ""rejiut"" was of a foreign stock, although it is not clear if from a single or a mixed source; it could have been also a region or area of geographical import and not the denomination of people. Whatever, this fine study sets the matter in due perspective and the authoress, as always, puts forward many challenging hypothesis of interest for the science of Egyptology. Most commendable for everybody interested in ancient Egyptian society, history and geography."
2,One good song,Echo Park is the only good song from this former member of the New Christy Minstrels (on their way downhill). Sorry.
2,Disappointing,"Started out looking to be a good enjoyable (easy?) read.Characters needed to be better developed. All problems, questions answered too neatly, easily.After 10 years absence from each others lives the characters are given the ability to set everything right in just a few days.The ending was predictable, the last line nonsense. Give readers some credit, even a leisure ""easy"" read should offer more."
4,Summer Island,Kristin Hannah is the BEST AUTHOR ever and as usual her characters keep one in suspense and cannot lay the book down at all.
4,A page turner,Really enjoyed this book. Kristen always seems to come through for her readers. I have never been disappointed with one of her books. Her story telling always increases your desire to want to know what is on the next page. This was a real page turner to find out what Jenna was hiding from.
5,Took My Breath Away,"Summer Island touched my soul where the most precious memories of my Mother and Daughter are stored. ""A daughter without her Mother is a woman broken."" Those words are so profound it takes my breath away. Kristin Hannah reaches down and grabs my emotion and does not let go until the end. A wonderful gift in a writer!"
3,Predictable but good,"I've had this book sitting around the house since 2001 or 2002 when I bought it. I had started it years ago and couldn't get into it. I enjoyed it, although I knew from the beginning how it would end, and I was right. It wasn't a bad read, though, and I'd recommend it."
3,eh,"I read ""Magic Hour"" and ""Winter's Garden"" and absolutely loved them, so, wanting more, I got this one. Significantly different. I guess it is an earlier work. It was too mushy, the characters were unlikeable, the stories were too ""oh please"". I will try other books by her because the first 2 were excellent, but later ones. This was not her best. Readable, but not good."
5,"A beach read, and something more","I am a fan of Kirstin Hannah, and knew that I would get an interesting story with well developed characters and a solid plotline. What I didn't know was how intricately woven everything would be! For example, Nora was a far more developed character than I initially expected, and her story was told honestly and realistically. The twists and turns were not over-the-top and made the story extremely appealing. The sub-plots were not mere filler, and made the book a far more absorbing read than it would have been otherwise. Recommended."
3,"A Good Story, Laced with Descriptive Details","A honeymoon destination of the Pacific Northwest and a favorable review from our local independent bookstore, motivated me to purchase this book from an author of whom I'd never heard. In some ways the book reminded me of the works of Anne River Siddons in it's ability to spin a compelling tale, lure me with descriptive details yet leave me a little disenchanted. In some places the writing seemed unfinished and immature. But the book fit my needs in it's storytelling and its setting-- being where I was visiting. For a Southerner, the San Juan Islands are an uncommon destination. It was fun and comforting to find someone capture in words the beauty and allure of a special place."
4,Loved it with one slight complaint,"This is a complex, absorbing story of relationships -- mother/daughter, brother/brother, young lovers who lost their way and are now seeking a way back. Summer Island is beautifully told, and the characters are realistic. They are flawed and imperfect and lovable all the same.My one and only complaint has to do with the gratuitous love scene. I don't like anything gratuitous in a book, and the lovemaking scene on the dock seemed just that to me. Thrown in. As if the author felt compelled to have one just for the sake of having one. The rest of the book was about love and healing of relationships. This scene was just about [making love] and seemed very out of place.But that's a small criticism. The book is certainly worth reading."
5,grab a tissue!!,This is one of those books that you wish would never end. It truly strikes a chord and touches you. By the end I was in tears....happy and sad. Home Again by Kristin Hannah touched me the same way. This woman can really write in a beautiful way that you remember long after you close the book.
3,Summer Island,I did not enjoy this as much as Kristin Hannah's other books. It did not keep me as interested as the others did.
3,Enjoyable story,"I enjoyed this story with the help of warm summer breezes in August. Good writing made this an enjoyable read, but the story left me wanting a little more from it. I am looking forward to reading another story from this author. It's definitely worth 3.5 stars!"
3,Not as expected,"This book was a nice read to pass the time, but deep enough for my tastes. The plot was predictable, as was the ending."
2,A few steps above Danielle Steel,"I am surprised to see this book rated so highly, because I really didn't think it was very good. I picked it up at a hotel in Europe while I was travelling, saw that it was on the New York Times bestseller list, and figured it had to be pretty decent. But I had just finished reading The Kite Runner, Bel Canto, and the Kalahari Typing School for Men, all of which I thought were very well written. It's true that she tackled some difficult subjects - and that's where she rose above Danielle Steel - but I didn't find the characters all that compelling, and the writing was uninspired."
5,I can't wait for the next book!,I really enjoyed Summer Island. It dealt with a mother -daughter relationship in a realistic manner. It also was a book about the power of forgiveness. And how we need to forgive in order to move forward in our life. Also Ms. Hannah's description of the San Juan Islands ( the setting of the book) makes me want to vacation there. Definitely a must read. I couldn't put it down and it many times moved me to tears.
4,relaxing,"I love books that deal with things real people deal with in their lives.I like books where the setting is on islands, anything by the water side.It very much takes me away to a relaxing frame of mind."
2,Summer Island by Kristin Hannah,I found this book only ok. I have read several of Hannah's other books and don't consider this one of her best. It is an easy read and mildly entertaining.
4,Made Me Appreciate My Mother More,"This is the second book I've read by Hannah, and she definitely delivered again. If you like a good cry - for the right reasons - then this book will do the trick."
4,Wonderful book about family forgiveness,"Enjoyable story with characters that are so real. I love every book I've ever read by this author because she is such a great adjective artist that I feel the surroundings that she describes as well as the people in the story. This book is about a woman that starts her young life married to a man she thinks she can help and lets him have the excuse of being a war veteran to explain why he's not-quite-the-man he could be. Nora isn't the perfect mother that she wanted to be and her one daughter, Ruby, rubs salt in that wound any chance she gets. This story is so relatable for any family member because we all have done things while raising our children or to our spouse that hind-sight would've saved a lot of hurt feelings. I certainly think this is a wonderful book to read and I guaranty will be enjoyed. The setting of Summer Island is so refreshing and peaceful---a great place for Eric to be as well as Nora and Dean and Ruby; all for their own special needs."
2,Sugar and more sugar,"I read the reviews here, then bought and read the book! All predictible and roll-your-eyes fluff."
4,Excellent Choice,"Received this as a gift, and that's exactly what it was, a GIFT! Kristin Hannah has such insights in to the relationships between mothers and daughters. I simply couldn't put it down."
3,Nice Story,This story was quite heartwarming. A family torn apart and the journey to find each other again. The story was sometimes predictable and boring but was well written. The author did a great job developing the characters. Enjoyable light reading.
2,A disappointing let-down,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed ""On Mystic Lake"" & ""Angel Falls"", both of which I would rate with 5 stars, I had high expectations of ""Summer Island"". Instead, I found this book to be rather schmaltzy with a predictable ending.Mother and Daughter are estranged for several years. Mother is a high-profile radio personality. Daughter is down in her luck. Mother gets injured in a car accident soon after her career goes down the tubes. Mother and Daughter spend a week together at the family's summer home breaking the ice and revealing their true colors and feelings to one another. In the mean time, Daughter's first love is nearby at his summer home spending the last few days with his dying brother. The outcome of Daughter's & estranged boyfriend's relationship is predictable, too.I gave this book 2 stars because of the heartfelt storyline between the two brothers. But overall, I felt the characters were right out of Soap Opera Digest."
5,Summer Island,Once again Kristin Hannah has done it. She draws you in and makes you feel like your part of the story. I love her writing and this book is great. Its not my favorite but it is still a awesome read.
2,Long-winded,The main story... if you can dig it out is good and sad. But when you read and read and you don't read anything at all the story gets boring. This book could be written with many less pages to make it a good and fast paced story.
5,Summer Island,I enjoyed this book very much. It feels like Kristin Hannah is writing right to you in all of her books.
4,Solid--but not as good as the previous cds,This is a solid work but much poppier and radio friendly than their previous works. Lyrically it is their darkest but most cohesive work. Every song thematically blends into the next as the songs focus on dysfunctional and destructive relationships the irony surrounding the human willingness to surrender ourselves to such things when one knows better. But sex is as much of an escape as drugs and this dysfunctional love is one addictive opiate in most of the songs. In some ways this album is a musical document of life as a Gen Xer as much as Douglas Coupland's novel Generation X.
3,Almost right...,"This book of Bible stories aimed at the very young is nicely illustrated and fairly well-written. However, it is far too short to be a ""Bible"" of choice for educating toddlers or those beginning to read. The choice of some of the stories included is questionable, particularly since context is lost. The Gospel stories included are especially inadequate, failing to do justice to the ministry and life of Jesus. Kids could certainly grasp more if given the opportunity to do so.Looking over similar products on the market, it is quite difficult to find one that satisfies all the necessaries: theological accuracy, wording, sense of style, beautiful illustrations, and completeness. This book could have been a contender, but its lacks in that final requirement only make it good, rather than great."
2,Not as good as the Shabbat and Chanukkah volumes,This video has less religious or Hebrew content than the Shabbat and Chanukkah volumes. It has some cultural components (like a visit to a school to talkg about recycling) but there isn't much uniquely Israeli going on. Customs like Tu Bishvat seders and eating the shivat haminim are not discussed.I liked how the number of the day is 15 so the children can hear many more Hebrew numbers.This volume suffers from volume problems in being much quieter than other disks in the series.
4,Worth buying if you like horse games,"From what I have played of this product, I like it so far.Pluses-Nice Graphics-You get to plan your own day, so you pick what you want to do when-Actually runs on a time scale-Not super easyMinuses-Actually a little challenging-Horse care takes forever-The talk thing is hard to understandThis game installed and runs perfectly on my computer, even though I don't have a supported video card. If you have all the other requirements, it will probably be fine. Also, sometimes you get stuck on an obstacle, and there aren't very many hints and tips online for this game."
3,Champion Dreams,I don't know if it's our computer or the program but you can't see the horse when you're riding it. You can see it when you groom. It's fun to buy show clothes though.
3,Stuck,"I have no idea on how to find the key to the attic room while getting Ginger's present. Where is it? Please, If anybody knows where it is can you tell me?"
4,Stuck in Morocco,Does anyone know how to beat the guy in the race? I've tried it like 20 times and I can't get past him. Very frustrating!
4,A great game!,I think this is a really good game and the graphics are really good compared to other horse games I have.I don't know how to get Ginger's gift in the attic. I keep on getting caught. I get to the part where you dial the telephone number and then i get stuck. Please help! It's a great game and i want to keep playing.
3,"Fun, but not the best SPOILERS!","This game is okay. You get to ride horses and stuff, so it's not that bad. Grooming is pretty boring, and the horses don't look so good. Some of the challenges are too hard, though. Like trying to get the gift. You have to sneek past a bunch of guards without being seen. It is almost impossible! And when you try to bring the horse home. I still can't figure out how to do it. Also, at the end of the week, you have to take a test where you do Cross Country, Show Jumping, and Dressage. If you fail, It says GAME OVER and go's back to the main menu. Then you have to start again from your last save, which can be extremly anoying. This game is okay, but not one of my favorites."
4,"extended/collected canter, piroutte, passage","HELP!! i can't get my horse to do an extended or collected canter! (but i can do it at the trot.) i also can't get him to do pirouttes or passages!! i've tried switching around the controls, but it doesn't make a differenece. its the same way in training mode..the game rocks other than this, but i really need help!! please repost what to do."
5,Best horse game EVER!!!,"This is a great game! The horses are beautiful, and it has great graphics! I do not tend to like games by this company, but this one was fantastic! A big must-have for horse lovers!"
5,"Super Game, love it.","I loved the game, it was fun, full of challenges. The stadium jumping ishard, and the dressage is hard. But the game makes you feel like you are a student at a riding school. And you are getting to do all the competitions. It was super.I do have a question, you get to the end and have won. How do you delete the game out, so you can start over. Anyone finish it, and start over? Help please...Vicky"
3,Less aerodynamic than you'd expect.,"I prefer the cassette version of this album over the CD by far. While I can fling the CD, frisbee-disc-style, a good 30 yards, I can easily slug the cassette long and hard into right field with no effort at all, giving even the most earlesque of Hanselmans enough time to round third and wind up a pumpkin."
5,Great DVD,"Awesome DVD! No subtitles, which was slightly disappointing, but overall, I am very pleased."
5,Amazing,"This was the first DVD of Coheed and Cambria that I have purchased. I have seen them in concert twice and will see them again this month. Blown away by the audio and visual experience captured by this particular DVD. Check out the ""The Final Cut"""
2,Not up to the usual high standards,"The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival.Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London.As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels."
4,Monk of the River Police,"Moving Monk back to the police force is a welcome change in the series. Needing the regular income, Monk replaces the hero of THE SHIFTING TIDE, Inspector Durban, as commander of the Thames River police, trying to win the respect of his men and solve the case of what appears to be a suicide. The dangers of sewer construction and the callous attitudes towards the lives of the people who do the work add a nice historical base for this case. There is also the intriguing shift in the relationship of Monk and his old nemesis, Runcorn. Sutton, Scuff, and Rathbone all make welcome appearances as the series seems to be reinvigorated by the change of scenery. The mystery becomes a bit convoluted with its many twists and turns, but overall this is another fine addition to the series."
1,Out of her element,"The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's. Her characters are hardly believable: Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones. Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function? Very disappointing."
4,She does it again!,"I have read all the Monk and Pitt books as well as the firstinstallment of her new series about a WW I chaplain. They are all absorbing and I enjoy reading them. HOWEVER, every book I've read always leaves me with some nagging doubts about the plot and its resolution. Just as Dr. Watson takes the place of the reader and asks Sherlock Holmes the questions the reader wants answered, I feel that every book she has written needs one additional chapter to tie up the loose ends. I wonder why her editors have never suggested this to her."
2,Not Up to Standards,"This book was extremely disappointing - not the usual caliber of work this author produces. The story was disjointed and filled with absurd coincidences. The characters were caricatures, and their behavior illogical. The only saving point were the descriptions of daily life on the waterfront in this period of English history. I would generally recommend this author, but not this particular story."
4,Early Crossover classic reissued.,"Corrosion of Conformity have had quite the comeback year in 2012. From releasing their excellent self titled disc in February with the original lineup*, to releasing a free EP Megalodon, and now ending the year with a reissue of their very first album, Eye For An Eye. This album is one of the first crossover albums and COC being one of the innovators of the genre. Fans not familiar with early COC are in for a surprise, as this album breezes by in a raw metal storm. But for fans who know this, the original COC, this album is a long overdue reissue. The booklet is pretty standard, with photos and lyrics. And as the cover states, it includes six songs with future lead singer/bassist Mike Dean. If you're new to COC and want to know their very beginnings, or an old fan scouring Ebay for this album, pick it up while it's available."
1,terrible,"I am huge fan of CoC's later work and I love old school hardcore. That explains my initial interest in Eye For An Eye, which is a supposed landmark in early hardcore punk. Wrong. This album is quite possibly the worst piece of recorded music I've had the misfortune of hearing. It's just BAD...I feel like a dunce for trading anything for this...Their songs have very little structure, some fast parts that are pedestrian at best, and of course awful vocals that barely register....Ok, punk is not supposed to be pretty...at least the Misfit's early stuff, Minor Threat, etc. was bearable. ""Eye for an Eye"" is utter garbage, don't waste your time."
5,Souix in space. Aliens on horseback !!,This is the story of the contact and trade teams of Earth.A much larger and more powerful empire of the stars have to death with outward diplomacy. But is there a silent conspiracy from inside the trade agency. Is it for or against the will of Earth.A good tale that compares cultures of different worlds and their similarities to Earth
2,"High expectations, dashed","After having previously seen Sallah Shabati and HaShoter Azulai, both directed by Kishon, I was hoping this movie would deliver more of the same. While true it does feature Topol as the main character, in this role I simply cannot get to like the person he portrays. This may be due to some of the cultural and generational differences between my time and that of the movie, but I had no such complaints with the other two movies mentioned.I found the plot to be jumpy, and that's when it can be followed at all. I couldn't make it through the first viewing without having my attention waver and finding myself bored and annoyed. It is as if a collection of 3 minute skits were compiled into a full length movie, with little discernible character growth or plot hinges.To sum up, unless you happen to have a cult fascination with any of the creators of this movie, I would recommend keeping a distance and trying your luck with other offerings."
4,Good video,"My 3 year old had the Weebles figures and we though she would like this DVD. There are several short stories which is good for holding her attention, and each one teaches a simple lesson."
3,FUN MOVIE!,MY two girls abosutely love watching the webbles sing songs. This movie keeps their attention. I certainly recommend this one.
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I was fooled into renting it by a ""more like this"" search and the 4 star rating... if only my Roku showed that the four stars was based on only 3 reviews -- there should be a minimum threshold.I tried to watch the trailer before renting, but the trailer is just a few minutes of the movie -- impossible to figure out anything.The movie is wholly unbelievable with a maniac murdering Russian gang. It could have been interesting in dealing with this different type of criminal and mob.There is no character development and so nothing enduring about the ""good guys"" either, so it was hard to care what was happening. The movie would also have been more interesting if the law was a third character.I really tried to finish watching it -- even fast-forwarding to the action scenes, but no scene hooked me in, and I gave up after a car chase where the good guys modify plastiques and turn them back on the mob."
5,Kick As* Movie,"My friend offered my this DVD as a gift for my birthday and I LOVE it !There is non stop action, amazing actors, you can't be disappointed.I definitely recommend"
3,"Good, But Not Quite Their Best Stuff","Being the huge fan I am of The Four Lads I couldn't wait to purchase the CD ""The Four Lads Sing Frank Loesser"". After all, wasn't it their rendition of ""Standing On The Corner"" by Frank Loesser that became the most popular version of that song? After listening to the CD I was struck with a sense that the boys were not quite at their best. Although the songs are sung fairly well, they seem to lack the usual sparkle, blending, and ease of delivery that one comes to expect from this group. Also, with all the great songs that Frank Loesser wrote I find the CD program to be a rather poor representation of Frank's artistry....""Where's Charley"" and ""Hans Christian Andersen"" medleys? Why wasn't music from ""The Most Happy Fella"" included? I found that the ""Guys and Dolls"" medley and a few other tracks made the purchase worthwhile. If you're a fan of this group, it's worth a listen."
1,Texture disappointing,"I've bought Laura Ashley sheets for years because of their looks and soft smooth texture. Though these look good and coordinate with my existing comforter, the texture is not soft but grainy. As a loyal Laura Ashley customer, I expected more from this line."
1,deceptive,"Pay attention to the size of this product. I assumed from the age group I was getting normal size stuff since my daughter is six. I could cover the pons up with my hands. The baton is also short but not as dissapointing. It is plastic that will bend and not return to shape, but is heavy enough. The megaphone is rediculous. About the size of a 7-11 big gulp. I didn't bother returning it because I would have paid about the same for shipping as I would have gotten back. If you are going to use it as a cute display for decorating, it might be sufficient, but the color on the display is not necessarily the color you will receive."
3,Fun combo gift,"I bought this for my Goddaughter for Christmas. The quality of the pom-poms and megaphone isn't very good, but she's four and won't be using it to go out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleading squad, so it suited the purpose. She really loved it and has fun playing cheerleader."
2,Difficult to use.,"The game is not difficult to understand, but it is difficult to use. The questions and categories are hard to see through the blue vynil screen. There are 35 different questions/answers to each double jeopardy -- which is adequate, but it takes some time to set up between game 1 and game 2. We had to write the categories on a larger sheet of paper so everyone could see them."
2,Jeopardy game,"The plastic apparatus for holding the questions and amounts is really cheesy. The question insert doesnt stay in the windo frames, the legs don't stay on, the $$$ cards art too tight for the space and so are hard to get out. Wasted my money on this product!"
3,What is Jeopardy?,"Fun game to play, many great questions. It's only fault being that it is a bit cumbersome to play with all the paper questions and more."
3,"More focus on the questions, less on the plastic packaging","Font was pretty small, and the blue backboard made it very hard to read. We just wanted to have fun with the questions, which we figured out a way to do that, but in spite of the format."
5,A fun family game,"Perfectly true to the TV game show, this board game is sure to bring hours of enjoyment. The questions are a fraction easier than those on the actual show, but by no means are they easy questions! You'll be impressed by how much you know and you'll joke about the off-the-wall questions that no one would know the answer to. It's a great game at a reasonable price. My family and I love it!"
3,not for the lazy,"This game is fun, however there are two downsides.1- the ""clickers"" are nothing more then a super version of a snapple cap. meaning it makes the same noise if you press the popped top of a snapple can. which makes it virtually impossible to tell who ""buzzed"" first.2- There is a lot of set-up before the game and in between rounds. This game is not for the lazy or impatient of people. You have to set up each money value every time. and as a side note, there is no distinct ""final Jeopardy"".the good side to this product is the fact that the questions are fun and challenging, if played in a group it can actually be very entertaining."
3,missing answers,"The Final Jeopardy answers were missing and the subjects in the ""Original Edition of Jeopardy"" were not all timely. Our 16 year old granddaughter did not always relate. Maybe I should have looked for a later edition if there is one available."
4,C#,"My selection shows the depth I use in choosing Items in my library, fine for furture upgrading my soft skills.Thank you, thank you, thank you.Happe New Year!"
3,Glaring typos and formatting errors mar a great story.,"I remember reading this book when it was first released in paperback. It was one of my favorite Star Trek novels, having read it several times. When I received a Kindle as a gift, this was one of the first books I downloaded. It is still a great novel, but the glaring typos, obvious formatting errors, and other mistakes act to pull the reader out of the story whenever they come across one. For example, When Kirk is talking to the Romulan Commander it reads ""I think, for me moment, you've got an ally."" Another example is when something is in all caps (as in a message or sign), there is often <s caps> before and after it.I recommend this novel if you can get it in paperback form rather than the kindle version."
5,Diane Duane Does It Again,"Ms. Duane has once again written a book that Star Trek fans everywhere can really get into. Her previous book, The Wounded Sky, was a great read, but somewhat cerebral. This book is less cerebral and more action oriented. It has the Enterprise operating deep within enemy territory in an uneasy alliance with a Romulan commander-general to achieve a common objective. If you are looking for adventure, Action, Intrigue, Treachery, and Space Battles, My Enemy, My Ally has them all, and Ms. Duane will satisfy your thirst with her easy to read writing style.I should point out that this review is of the Kindle Edition of this book. This edition was nearly free of conversion errors."
2,Revisionist Romulans,"The Romulans used to be my favorite Star Trek villains. I read the Rihannsu series because I thought it would be a fun exploration of Romulan culture and history. However, I barely recognized the Romulans in Rihannsu. The book degrades them and seems to radically alter their characters. The main character, Ael, seems too perfect, while the rest of the Romulans seem like a bunch of buffoons. Furthermore, the book radically changes Romulan history that just doesn't seem realistic. It's too bad - the Romulans as presented in the Original Series were fascinating characters who had both honor and deviousness. The Romulans in Rihannsu have little of either."
5,Happy Customer,The price was great and fast delivery and the DVD was in great shape very happy customer I recommend it to anyone that loves worship music a must have to your collection ..
5,Excellent!,"I loved this video! It was amazing and I bought 5 more for my friends and family for bday presents! It is so easy to order, it's delivered quite quickly, and it is not expensive! Thank you Amazon!"
5,Awesome. Time well spent,Watch this video on a regular basis. Listen to the CD when I drive. Awesome way to reconnect my heart with God. Great gift to share my faith.
5,A great Product,The order arrived on time. Packaging was excellent. The DVD works great. The music is inspirational. I just love it. The worship experience is real
5,"AWESOME, WONDERFUL. CAN'T STOP WATCHING AND WORSHIPPING!!!",This is without a doubt one of the best worship DVD's yet. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Lord and who loves to worship. Amazing!!!
5,Moroccan Roll all Night and Party Everyday!,Awesome prog/fusion featuring some great musicianship from all. This is some inspired stuff and I highly recommend this if you are a fan of prog/fusion.
5,A Fusion Classic,"This album is Brand X at their best. Many would say that Mahavishnu's Inner Mounting Flame was the quintessential fusion album, but I'd say this one delivers stiff competition. Lumley's flowing melodies soar in front of Goodsall's intricate picked (not strummed) rhythms and Jones' innovative bass lines. If that's not enough, Phil Collins does his best work ever on the drums right here. There's no comparision to his work in Genesis -- who knew the guy could play this well? If you love fusion, you've gotta have this one."
4,Who Ever Said That Aimless Noodling Was Wrong?,"I actually think those that reviewed this as ""aimless noodling"" is quite amusing. In my opinion I don't think that there's anything wrong with a little ""aimless noodling"". I like the various musical approaches on this album. You can definitely tell that the band was working together as a team. I especially like the tracks ""Malaga Virgen"", ""Sun In The Night"" and ""Maybe I Should Lend You Mine..."". The track ""Sun In The Night"" features Phil Collins on vocals. This is my second favorite Brand X album.I definitely recommend it."
4,One Great Mind Parses Another,"If you are looking for a fairly short, easy to digest introductory guide to Ulysses and Finnegan's Wake, this is it. Anthony Burgess, in addition to being a witty novelist and critic, also had the chutzpah to publish an abridged version of Finnegan's Wake, so you know he knows his stuff! This is not a page by page explication of Joyce's complex works, ala Gifford or Gilbert, but more like a defense for the intelligent reader who may be wondering if these novels are worth the time.It is wonderful that the cover of this June 2000 paperback reissue has features an image of Joyce looking away, his face hidden from the reader. Joyce remains an enigma-- a sparkling inspiration to readers who enjoy thinking about the questions and don't care about definitive answers.If you've read A Clockwork Orange or Nothing Like the Sun and are curious about Anthony Burgess' critical work, this is one of his best performances."
3,Very dissappointed with this DVD contents,I pre-ordered this DVD and received it on the second day of the release which was April 27. Firstly this is an extremely lovable movie ...no doubts about it...which I have seen 2 times in Dallas theaters which it was released in Dec 2009. My biggest anger points1. The USA- DVD release of 3 idiots happened one year after it was officially released in India. I mean the movie released on Dec 2009 and USA DVD release in April 2011. Who dropped the ball here?2. The contents of this DVD. This is India's higest grossing movie of all times and just ONE SINGLE DVD. Pickup any DVD from Krrish to Dabanng to any super duper hit. Why is this only DVD? Who dropped the ball here?? 20th Century Fox??3. The Main Menu DOES NOT HAVE A SONGS or ALL SONGS selection. What is this??????Do I need to say more that I am dissappointed about this DVD.......- Koustubh
3,"Good theme and story, but dragged out for way too long!","I'm a huge Aamir Khan fan and I liked not only the theme of this movie, but also the solid performances of all the actors. My biggest problem with the film, however, is that it's way too long. The movie should have been re-edited for American audiences and at least 45 minutes of useless dialogue should have been removed. The main point of the story is very interesting, but as I like my movies to be more about quality than quantity, I had to skip many of the scenes just to get to the main point of the story. Again, Bollywood, if you want international audiences, especially Americans, to find interest in and view your film, please do us all a favor and edit them for time. Indian and other audiences may not care -and may actually like the longer running times- but tastes being different, we Americans do want our movies short and sweet."
2,Very nave and overall bad movie,"I can't believe people are liking this movie! I have watched many Bollywood movies and this one is by far the worst one. The cinematography is 50 year old, there are hardly any laughs and I thought it was just a stupid movie."
5,LOVED IT!!,"Way better than the stupid cover!!!!!!! I loved it and can't wait to watch it again. I laughed, I cried, it had it all."
5,Fantastic Movie!,"This is the movie that everyone should watch. It is not just any other comedy or chick-flick movie. The movie is full of humor but on the same hand it teaches us lesson about a life that has very deep meaning to it and I believe all teachers and education system should watch this movie. The movie sends a message of being creative in life and not just being only followers. It's a story about friendship, love, flawed education system that creates unhealthy competition , and the most important having the courage to be different and think different in life.Amir khan as always has been the anchor of this movie. His role cultivates the thinking of a normal college student who is caught up in vicious cycle of our education system where primary goal is all about getting grades and secondary goal is understanding it.I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie."
5,Great movie,"3 Idiots is warm and funny - one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. It has plenty of twists and turns, with just enough predictability to follow the story. It is quite long (2hrs, 43min) but doesn't drag."
2,It wouldn't play in my DVD player.,"The movie was great, terrific, in fact, but the DVD wouldn't play in my DVD player. At first it wouldn't even play in my computer, but we got it to work. There should be some kind of warning against buying different versions that won't play on American equipment."
5,Great film,This is a fantastic film. Well done with a wonderful story. It vaguely reminded me of the film Dead Poet's Society and the book Zorba the Greek. I liked the idea that this is your life so pursue your dreams rather than another dream placed on your shoulders.
5,Transformative theater,"I was fortunate enough to catch this production live, in 1983.It changed my life.Ripples from this performance have rocked Shakespeare, performances, the very language I speak and write. Seldom can one evening's theater do so much for a person's understanding and appreciation of life."
2,Ian McKellen's DVD ACTING SHAKESPEARE,"To me, Ian McKellen can do no wrong; however, this DVD was a bit disappointing. It's a one-man show in front of a live audience which he addresses between each characterization. He's wonderful elsewhere (Lear, MacBeth, not to mention Gandolph), but here his performances of various Shakespearean characters seem a bit shallow and lacking in context and color."
4,Informative and Entertaining,This is a must-see documentary. Anyone who truly understands gerrymandering and politics will quickly recognize how this film pinpoints the root of the growing partisan divide in America.
1,Visit these places in Seattle at your own risk!,"This past weekend 10/29-29 2006, ten people were sent to the hospital, three in very critical condition following a weekend of gunfire and violence in downtown Seattle! These stabbings and shooting didn't happen in Rainier Valley south of downtown (the Valley of Death) where most of the gunshot victims come from, these came FROM DOWNTOWN SEATTLE.My advice: If you visit Seattle, come wearing a bulletproof or Kevlar vest! Drug gang violence is out of control in the city.As for the so-called best places in this book, many of the street corners of these ""best places"" are OWNED by drug dealers who stand there in rain or shine selling meth or crack, while the police look on and do nothing because they say THEY DON'T HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE! Yeah, sure ya bet cha! It just turns out the drug lords are better armed than the police."
2,OTC Conical Pitman Arm Puller for Light Trucks,Unit appears well designed but poorly manufactured. Screw is a very loose fit in the body and will probably strip the threads after a few hard uses.
5,Beat Angel DVD,"What an impressive independent film (shot on 16mm with analog sound!). A film that any Kerouac and beat generation afficionado will enjoy. The cinematography and direction(Randy Allred) is superb! The music in the film is perfect and the cast is very talented from the starring actors to the supporting roles, all well chosen and people who I hope to see more of on the big screen.Though this film is great to see on DVD, I think such a film deserves to be seen at a real cinema(take note film festival selection committees!)"
1,Terrible,I'm a big fan of the beat generation but this film was slow and poorly done. Don't waste your money.
1,No stars! PC-SPES killed people,"(The rating system does not allow zero stars.)PC-SPES was not ""natural."" It worked because it contained DES, a synthetic estrogen, which enlarged men's breasts, shrank their penises, and caused blood clots. To combat the blood clots, it contained warfarin, a synthetic blood thinner widely used as a rat poison. This caused men to bleed to death.(...)"
2,PC SPES Treatment Hits A Snag.,"James Lewis possesses an abundance of knowledge about prostate cancer and the bewildering array of treatments used to fight this disease. Evidence of the author's wisdom is found throughout THE HERBAL REMEDY FOR PROSTATE CANCER.Unfortunately treatment using PC SPES has recently hit a huge snag. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned consumers to cease taking PC SPES because it contained undeclared prescription drug ingredients. As a result of this action by the FDA, the manufacturer of the product has gone out of business. PC SPES had been used with promising results by many prostate cancer patients who have since been left scrambling for alternative treatments. Many have tried other herbal or natural remedies while some others have turned to the more traditional medical option of hormones."
2,Could have been so much better,"I found myself more excited to begin this book than I did actually reading it. To begin with the first four chapters were so sketchy that I almost couldn't take it. The author constantly changed the subject in the middle of the scene, so you were like, ""Whoa, how did we get here."" Sketchy and all over the board. The story itself sounded interesting, a rich lady going to a reverse brothel and discover her own sexual awakening. That sexual awakening didn't really exist, and the ending was too abrupt, leaving too many unanswered questions. It would have been better if the author had developed the characters a more and not have been all over the place. Don't recommend it, unless one thinks it fits their tastes."
3,"Well written, but stifling","I too, am mystified by the reviewers who found this book humourous and/or in any way remotely romantic. The irony is, the primary character supposedly goes to the hotel to escape her suppressed existence...but life at the hotel is static, like a claustrophobic hothouse!The book is well-written, but reading it is like wearing a sweater that's too warm - initially comforting, and then...you just want to throw it off, and move on to something more invigorating."
2,Did I Miss Something???,"I hate to leave any type of negative book review, because I respect authors and their hard work so much. On the other hand, I have to honest. I would not recommend this book to friends. I really had a hard time with it. I found it incredibly boring. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters and they just bored me to tears. I kept reading hoping that something would happen, but nothing did! I was suprised to see so many reviewers exclaiming how humorous this book was, but I just didn't get it. I did not laugh or even crack a smile once. This one just didn't do it for me."
2,Took Too Long To Get Good,"Charlotte leaves her sick bed for the first time in a year only to see her husband kissing another woman. Since this is only 1900 and there aren't many choices for a woman, she decides to take a break from her comfortable but stifling marriage and sets up housekeeping in Boston at The Beechmont, which turns out to be a male brothel in which handsome porters make discreet visits to the establishment's female clientele. There is a curious cast of characters, but they are too shallowly drawn to get a good liking for any of them. This book just rambles too much for my taste. It doesn't get interesting until well past page 100."
1,Where did it go wrong?,"After a somewhat lyrical & intriguing start this story simply tanked. What happened? Who knows because it degenerated into a silly muddle that was a total waste of my time. Will I ever get those hours back? I don't think so. The one star is for the premise, the missing four stars are for all the lost promise. A Private Hotel would have made a great short story, it was about 150 pages too long."
1,"Excellent prose, but in the end, not a great read","I decided to read this because of the recommendation by author Julia Glass (she wrote Three Junes).I agree with others that the writing is superb, particularly in the first few chapters. The author paints a fascinating picture of what life is like in the early 20th centurty. I found that to be the most engaging part of the story.As the book drags on, there are many unanswered questions. For instance -- who was the woman that Hays was stooping to kiss at the beginning of the book? Characters come and go and contribute little to the story, the ""gratifying surprise"" at the end as intimated by Julia Glass, is hardly gratifying and not much of a surprise. Should we really care that much about the situation between Arthur and Eunice? We barely know anything of Eunice until the ""surprise""."
2,"Well-written, I suppose, but a colossal bore","I kept on plowing through this book because I was sure it would get better, but it never did. It reminds me of a really well-made film--you can admire its artistic merit, but it's no fun at all to watch."
3,not her best work,"This CD is from two films with Doris Day; Moonlight Bay and By the Light of the Slivery Moon, both appropriately with ""moon in the title because they are indeed moony. Basically, the only reason you will enjoy this CD is either because you like the films a lot or because you LOVE Doris Day. While Doris Day sings lesser material better than most others sing good songs, you probably should stick with her hits."
5,audiobook (CD) review,"I agree with all the wonderful things that have been mentioned. I am giving 5 stars for Pema Chodron's content.I have heard recordings of Pema Chodron's retreats before and I enjoyed her lively, spirited delivery. This book, however, was read by Joanna Rotte. I struggled with the overly artificial, flat, syrupy delivery. Especially, when the subject was equanimity, preferences, and expectations. :-) If I could grade the Rotte separately, I would rate the delivery at 2 or 3 stars."
4,This is not a 1 month reading,"I am new on those buddhism staff, so I became to realize that you never end reading and learning from this sort of books.Altough some terms results difficult to understand to me, It became a valuable source of advice."
5,I haven't quite finished this book but enjoy what I have read so far.,I ordered this book because it was referred to me from a friend I have read it somewhat. I go to different chapters and take what I can from it. thank you Amazon.
5,Inspiring,"If you are looking for the way forward, then consider this short book.Pena writes with warmth, wit and wisdom.She takes you by the hand and leads you through your fears.Inspiring stuff."
2,"Paid for new, but shipped a used book","The content of the book is very well written and applicable. However, I paid for a new book but was shipped one that was used. It had some creases and bends in it and I thought those were just the byproducts of rough shipping, but then I noticed a sticker on the back that said ""used"". I'm curious who the person at Amazon was that made the decision to ship me a used book even though I paid for a new one. Is this a new policy of Amazon? Sleazy."
2,Honesty,"I have listened to all of the tapes and cd's that Pema Chodron has put out plus the books but even though the tape set that I have implies that Pema is speaking on the tapes it is actually not her voice or spirit. This should have been stated up front. The reader sounds like she is reading from a script rather than from her heart. Not very helpful! I will get the book. Truthful advertising is very important in any circumstance. Especially in "" spiritual"" communication. Thanks to Pema anyway."
5,"Excellent, SB 1 or God a serious compliment to this","This author is one of the few who is very close to her work, She worked hard at putting this on paper and especially for any reader. To find peace is one thing, but since this book is truth that is hard to find Peace will last for the reader of this book. A simple meditation is taught with good backing and real spirtuality. A book also of giving, teaching reason for compatability. I give very few book reviews and the only reason I do is to recommend a read. This is a definite yes.A very enlightening book that I must recommend is ourselves being one, titled SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox, a book that gives the ultimate true reasons for enlightenment."
2,Too theoretical and general,"To my dismay I find that this book gives very very little practical advice on how to live through difficult times.If you are in a difficult time, and want to seek some advice on how to cope, then dont waste your money on this book, as it would not help."
5,Book of wisdom,"This is a great source of help, comfort and wisdom. Would recommend this author to everyone who is on a serious spiritual journey."
4,Compassion to Battle Fear,"No one gets through life without being asked to do some heroic deed whether internal or external. All heroic deeds have fear attached to them or else they wouldn't be heroic, right?My recent heroic deed was to tell the truth. Reading Pema Chodron's, ""The Places that Scare You"" showed me that there are many mental/spiritual positions a person can take when being fearful. One helpful bit of advice was to take a deep breath and observe that fear, what is it trying to point us to, what needs to be changed so that that fear can be disarmed? It is a wonderful guide for compassionate introspection. Compassion being the key word here - first for ourselves then for others."
5,Thank you Pema!,"I bought this book out of desperation. I was experiencing emotional turmoil I had never experienced before and could not get a handle on it. This book happened to be featured in one of my on-line news letters and was a God send.I started to cry within the first 3 pages. It helped me to let go of so much anxiety. I thought I was going crazy because I could not control my emotions. This book was my anchor and helped me to hold on. I have notes written all over my book where her words brought out my own honesty with myself. It was the best therapy I could have had. It helped me identify with myself and understand that it is really OK to be feeling that way. It helped me to get a grip and move on.I have bought several of Pema Chodron's books since, but none have hit the spot like this one. Thank you Pema!"
3,Like many books,"This is a good book, but like many spends way too much time rehashing the same concepts. After you've read the first 50%, the author spends the next 50% telling you the same thing in different ways."
3,The Places That Scare You: A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times,Too introspective for me. I prefer the second in this series:Taking the Leap: Freeing Ourselves from Old Habits and Fears
2,Only for the more sophisticated Buddhists,"At the suggestion of a friend, I purchased this book for another close friend going through a divorce. I scanned through it myself, fortunately, because this book is not for the average layperson -- not even a highly intelligent one. Most references require intimate knowledge and commitment to Buddhist ideals and concepts.I am not claiming this is a bad book, but I believe it will be of little or no use to the non-initiated."
2,Great content but Disliked the vocals,"I too was disapointed this was not Pema's voice. In fact, I disliked the low tone of the voice used on this CD. Content was fabulous!"
3,"Not too bad, but not the best either","It has its unique way of saying things, but sounds very much like a series of inspirational talks put together in a book. I have read a few others and have found them to include more and pull things together a little better, but nonetheless it was a good, short read."
3,Disappointing Voice Over,"I buy Pema's CD's because I love her teachings, but also because I love her voice! I find it incredibly relaxing and adore that I can ""hear"" her smile. I have 5 other CD's, and they are all recordings of Pema's talks.I was very sad to find that this CD is a woman reading Pema's book, not Pema speaking. Otherwise, the content is still fantastic."
2,dumb,"It's just bad. I don't know what more to say. Don't waste an hour watching it, you will not get that hour of your life back."
1,"Terrible, don't waste your time.",This show was cringe-inducingly bad. The lack of chemistry between the co-hosts is overcompensated for with either awful writing or awful adlibbing. They make glaring mistakes from an engineering and scientific stand-point and it just doesn't work. They're trying too hard to be MythBusters or something. I'm definitely happy this show got canned. It was insulting of Discovery to think that people would enjoy this tripe.
4,A classic,"I had never read this during schooling. My daughter was cast in a production of Pride and Prejudice, so I had already been transported back beyond this era. I am delighted to have read this at an age when I can appreciate it."
4,What in The Dickens?,"Charles never fails to surprise me. I am not sure how this one slipped pass me in high school, but it was not going to get pass my kids. I am introducing them to various periods in literature (for a different approach) and as we began our investigation into Dickens we stumbled upon a very interesting adventure comprised of: neglect, deciept, naivety, and of course his overall theme, class. The romance theme was refreshing to his work."
2,not his best book,"This is not Dickens's best work. Previous to reading Bleak House I read David Copperfield. What a difference. You cant expect EVERY book by an author to be great. Dickens has more than his share of great great books, but i dont think this is one of them."
3,Doubleplus edition of Bleak House for Kindle,"There are several reasons why this edition at 99 cents is a good deal, better than various free editions and the more expensive Vintage Classics edition. This Doubleplus edition features clean formatting, few, if any, typos or OCR artifacts, and hyperlinked chapters. It does not contain the original illustrations as do some other Kindle editions (neither does the Vintage edition). It also does not offer any hyperlinked footnotes in the text, as is so helpful in Penguin Classics.This edition does feature, as an introduction, a very readable essay on Dickens by G.K. Chesterton. Overall, this edition is a better bargain than the Vintage Classics edition for Kindle, which normally sells for about $5.99. Celebrate the Dickens bicentennial with this tasty morsel."
5,Bleak House,"It's a toss up between this and oliver twist for my favorite dickens novel. I love the way he describes the court system--like it's some evil cult that eats babies. And the suspense never slows down, just keeps getting faster, which is quite an accomplishment for a cinder-block sized novel. And as for Esther (one of my fav characters ever), I wouldn't describe her as naive , but as very modest and much too willing to see the good in everything and everyone except herself, and this is why she's so darned likable. So wade through this book, cause it's good for you!"
4,"BY LAWYERS, OF LAWYERS AND FOR LAWYERS",Another Dickens Masterpiece. This book expresses Mr. Dicken's opinion about a legal system that has become self serving and self justifying. The story is set in Old England but could just as easily apply to today's involuted Tort System especially as it applies to class action suits.Mr. Dicken's distrust and disdain for self serving people in the legal profession comes out.This book shows how destructive it is to place one's hopes in that which is undeserving.
3,Long and Dark,"I could easily write many negative things about this novel. For starters it is LONG. It is more a social and political commentary than a novel. The story follows many interconnected subplots told from the point of view of a third person narrator - or from the first person viewpoint of Esther Summerson, whose voice is not the least bit believable. (Biting the inside of my cheek to refrain from making snarky Mary Sue comments) The subplots are all tied up too neatly at the end.Did I mention how long it is?Nevertheless, it kept me interested enough to finish reading it. (Well, almost. After a certain character died, I read the remaining 8% out of sheer stubbornness) Despite the lack of character development, I found myself sympathizing with many of the characters and caring what happened to them."
2,Poor formatting on this electronic edition,"I love Dickens, and free Kindle downloads are great, but this edition is formatted so poorly that it became a trial to read after a few chapters. Many words are run together and punctuation is limited, making Dickens' long, phrase and clause-filled sentences difficult to decipher. I ended up buying the complete works for about $4.00. Much better reading experience."
5,Bleak House,"What is the Bleak House? It is an old mansion, home of John Jarndyce and his three wards: Ester, Ada and Ricard. It is also the squalid conditions of Tom's-All-Alone. It is the bleak out come of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce. It is the Victorian shame of an illegimate child. There are many bleak houses in this book.Bleak House carries a warning against the excesses of nuisance suits and the danger of a laisez-faire government which it wraps up in a delightful albeit complex and dense comedic romance of a young woman supposedly orphaned and sent to live with her guardian who is stuck in a generations long lawsuit over an estate. Interestingly, I recently read an American story that obviously borrowed heavily from Bleak House. To anyone who enjoys Bleak House, I recommend The Big Mogul by Joseph C. Lincoln."
4,colourful dickens,Much easier to follow and understand after seeing the on screen production. Pages of description paint a picture in such detail it is felt no detail is forgotten.Dickens characters are larger than life and so colourful you would like to meet them or avoid them but observe from a distance.
2,Bleak House - difficult to read,"Bleak House was very difficult to read. I tried to persevere with it as the story outline was interesting, but had to give up. It was like trying to learn a new language."
5,great dickens novel,"yesdickens is hard to read.yesthis is a poorly formatted edition. however,the kindle edition is easier to hold than an 800 page novel.dickens has written a masterpiece with memorable characters.his thoughts and criticism of english society are easy to decipher."
