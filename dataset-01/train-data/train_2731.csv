5,Great New Cookbook,This is one of my new favorites. I subscribe to the magazine but could not resist getting the book too. The pictures are beautiful and appetizing ...The 'Red Rice' recipe is YUMMY !
4,BAD INSTRUCTIONS!,"I've noticed many people complaining about the batteries for this train, and that the train only works for the first few weeks. Well, we had the EXACT same experience, which was very very frustrating. what the train instructions do NOT tell you is that in addition to the 4 battery cells being on the train, there is also two 1.5 AA batteries (on the front train). This is NOT apparent or intuitive. 3months after buying the train, we finally figured out this additional spot. After many months of frustration, we finally got it to work; my boy is happy now; all is well."
2,Dissapointed,"My son enjoyed the train while it worked (for about 5 months) a lot. However, the train suddenly ""died"" and we have tried to no avail to change the batteries. We purchased batteries a couple of times to make sure that we did not have ""bad"" batteries. I expected better things from a BRIO train."
2,Problem with the remoteh,"After opening this toy for Christmas, it appeared dead. All the batteries were fine. I took apart the remote and one of the wires from the battery compartment to the circuit board appears to be loose, almost like it wasn't soldered (actually, it looks like glue) on properly.I redid the connection and the train is working fine. My 3 year old loves it.Test the train before giving it as a gift!"
1,worked for one hour!,"My son only played with the train an hour before it completely stopped working! We were going to change the batteries, to see if that was the problem... But it takes cell batteries!I wont buy Brio again!"
3,A Start,"This book was a quick, simple read - just what the ADD need! It's not going to solve your ADD problem 100%, but it certainly provides a great start to improving your current situation."
5,Excellent place to begin,"What makes this a great book is that it really outlines all of the major implications of having ADD and gives some ideas for how to address them. It is short, and hence a quick read that will get you started thinking about where to go next in researching specific ADD-related issues."
3,Go get a beeper,"Read this book the other day because I was drawn to the title. This book is a bit outdated. However, I did not see any new tips that I have not read in other books except the suggestion that you carry a beeper. that's right a beeper. so if you're at the mall with someone and they can't find you, they can beep you so you know they're looking for you. now I'm not sure when this book was written but that beeper part was hilarious. I don't think the author knows there are cell phones. Or perhaps she does and is in cahoots with the beeper industry and trying to increase sales. The author also tries to explain what a ""PDA"" is and why useful (again ignoring the smartphone and cell phone industry overall) and also explains computers and fax machines. save your money in my opinion. you'll need it so you can save up and get a beeper at an antiques shop somewhere."
2,Watered down?,"I picked this book up along with several others just to explore the possibility of having Adult ADD. Of them all, this one was among the least helpful because it was a bit too simple. It leans toward the camp of ""snap out of, it's just ADD!"" I felt a bit offended by the tone. Fortunately, there are many other good texts out there to fill in the 'gap.' One of my favorites has become What Does Everybody Know That I Don't, or something along those lines. It takes a more realistic approach to real life inside the ADD mind. Still, 10 Simple Solutions is not horrible, there are a couple of nuggets to be gleaned if you're willing to do the mining."
3,too simple,"I found the book was too simple. Not enough detail for someone with ADHD to be able to follow through with the ""simple solutions"""
5,A pocket-sized book of ADD tips (if you have largish pockets),"I really like this book. It is pretty short, but it contains some very good ideas. I read it a few days ago, and picked up a few tips which I've been using. The brevity helps to avoid information overload, but there are plenty of citations throughout so that the reader can look into the research if they decide to.The layout is great. It's easily readable from cover to cover in one day, but it is also very easy to jump straight to the relevant idea when you need it. I like the fact that there are exercises at the end of each chapter to help with synthesising the information.My only complaint is that, in the descriptions of ADHD, hyperactivity is normally assumed, so for inattentive types it can be hard to relate to some of the examples. But the tips have been useful and they seem like they would be applicable for all types of ADHD."
3,"Decent, depending on what kind of help you need","This was one of the first books I read on Adult ADD, and I liked it. It did have allot of good ideas, and covers just about all areas. If you need help with organization and time management, I'd recommend ""ADD Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life"" before this book, but if your focus isn't on just those two issues, this book has broader info, covering other topics, such as the workplace and social skills. So, get this book depending on your needs."
2,it's good when it works,"I was very excited to get this light, I've been wanting one for a while. After a little it would stop working and so I'd have to tinker around to get it to work. The batteries are not an issue, but getting it to complete the circuit is. When it does work it's very bright and is every thing I hoped for. All in all I would not rely on this light, but I may have just got a lemon."
1,Unreliable Product,"I purchased this flashlight on Feb. 12, 2010. After less than 10 minutes of run time, one of the LED's began to flicker and then stopped working. I contacted Inova and provided them with the information they requested to begin repair. Inova has not responded since."
3,Decent but dim.,"Not nearly as bright as a 2 A cell Energizer LED light that I paid less for. And the Inova uses MUCH more expensive batteries.The Energizer is about 2 inches longer, so unless size is a major criterion I recommend the Energizer Metal 1 Watt LED flashlight over this one. If you really want a smaller one check out the Coast LED Lensers."
3,Used does mean USED!,"I love the story and the graphics; however, the condition of this book was not what I expected. A few pages were stuck together and when separated, the text on the page was damaged. Also, the first page of the book had writing on it in permanent marker :( Probably would have paid about 25 cents for it at a garage sale!"
5,Makes me a better mom,"This book is so sweet. It makes me stop and appreciate all the little things about our boys that can drive us crazy.""Even when you lose your shoes, I love you just the same,"" she says, and the picture shows a little boy in his church clothes with his pants rolled up like he played in the creek. I love cuddling with my little boys and loving on them while we read it."
1,Don't bother watching!,"To all anime fans, do not waste your time watching this series. I watched it when it was streamed on crunchyroll and thank God because it prevented me from wasting $30 on this mess. There are more problems with these series then I could possibly name but the big one is definitely lack of focus on everything. Although there is one main protagonist, the story stumbles through about 2 or 3 others with no idea who the star is. On top of that, the antagonist is your typical ""humanity is evil and needs to be destroyed"" type, utterly predictable. Like I said, do not waste your time on this series."
2,"Entertaining, but not for experienced teachers","This book was an entertaining read, I will admit, but I was disappointed by it. When I was a first-year teacher, I probably would have found this a useful book (though there were other books that I found much *more* useful), but as an experienced teacher, I found nothing in it that I didn't already know. If you've made it past your first few years of teaching, it's a waste of money."
3,Good if you're middle school and up.,"This book is better suited for middle school teachers and beyond. As an early childhood teacher, I did not get as much out of the book as I had hoped."
3,Short Sweet and To the Point,"This is a great book for what I wanted it for, an honest look into the schools Teach for America corps members work in. It is a very easy and short read which still manages to touch on the important lessons he learned in his first years of teaching. I especially enjoyed the back end of this edition because he revisits some assumptions and opinions he had made when he first wrote the book."
3,"Nice story, but no real quality or innovative classroom management advice","I enjoyed reading the story of Mr. Rubinstein's first year struggles. However, I didn't find the advice to be new or innovative. I am an early childhood (pre-k through third grade) teacher, and many of his theorys are not intended for the younger students. Great for a laugh, but not much in the way of classroom management advice."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was an easy read. I was able to read it in two day. The book is a good read with humor and walks through the author's mistakes during his first year of teaching. I was expecting more suggestions on how to implement certain tactics to use in my classroom though. It only listed a few things to try such as dressing like a teacher. Overall, I liked the book and the few suggestions it offeres, but if you are looking for more detailed ideas you should check out books like ""Setting Limits in the Classroom"" by Robert J. MacKenzie."
4,"Breezy and fun -- the book version of ""a rental""","This is a good pass-around book for new teachers. Since I'm currently student teaching, it fit the bill as a friendly introduction to some of the most basic dos and dont's of classroom management. Kind of like a ""For Dummies"" book, except that in this book the jokes are actually funny.However, I can't imagine that if you've been teaching for more than a year or two you'd learn anything here.It takes only a few hours to read, the cartoons aren't bad, and it is, thankfully and appropriately, a paperback."
5,Great help,This is the first book that I have found truely helpful in a class full of Jr. High students. Great resource.
2,"High on humor, low on practical",This book is a quick read and tells us all that we make mistakes when it comes to classroom management. And that most of us get better over time. It was weak on practical ideas for teachers looking for new motivational methods for classrooms.
3,It's alright,"Good book- wasn't great-don't necessarily look for tips in here- it's just a fun, quick read"
3,A laugh out loud book for every teacher!,"As a third-year teacher, I found the book easy to read with plenty of laughs - especially the author's accounts of staff-required inservices. However, there were few actual classroom management techniques offered, which was my purpose for buying the book. It's an enjoyable read for those teahers wanting to feel relief in knowing others had made the same mistakes in classroom discipline efforts, but look elsewhere for management plans to use in your own classroom."
2,It's a nice story but that's about it.,"While this book is fast-paced and written with a sarcastic tongue, it was largely impractical. If you want a story about first year teaching, this is your book. If you want answers to your questions regarding discipline, this is not the book to purchase. The author starts off asking a lot of questions regarding discipline that I have but fails to answer any of them in the book. Much of the information that he presents is fairly common knowledge (e.g. don't yell, don't be your students' friend). Save your money to purchase one of the more expensive books on discipline. They may not be as entertaining to read but they are much more useful."
5,Is your class running all over you?,"I got this book, because I was having trouble controlling the kids in my Sunday school class. It gives some good common sense approaches to classroom behavior and it gives you insight into the authors struggle to become a good disciplinarian.If you are in a teaching role with kids and started out wanting to make things fun and interesting, but feel like you have lost control, this book will help."
3,OK,He does not tell you how to make the transformation from reluctant to strong willed. I figured he would have some words of advice or to think of something else when the class is out of control or arguing back............. but he doesnt.He does tell what does work and what doesnt work which is a start but not an end all do all to master the classroom.
2,"Cute, but just common sense.","This was a cute book, but not helpful. I'm a 2nd year teacher, and while Rubinstein has amusing anecdotes, most of what he has to say is just common sense, boiling down to: keep your temper, be yourself, and plan for everything. I was really looking for some gems of wisdom, but was very disappointed in this overly quick read. If someone you know has it, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, just talk to teachers with experience - that will help you more than this book."
2,Not much help...,"This was a cute book and a quick read, but not much help. Very little solid advice, and most of that was common sense. There are better classroom management books available."
1,An unnecessary read,"There's not enough in this book to warrant purchasing and/or reading it. A large proportion of the work contains the author's introduction of himself (not applicable in the classroom) and then he espouses what not to do (equally not applicable because the information is not immediately countered by what a teacher should do). What a teacher should do for discipline problems, the author explains, comes down to deciding what kind of teacher you want to be. He provides 5 examples of different ""types"" of teachers (overly generalized, although amusing, and mostly unrealistic). The only value in this book emerges in the last 10 pages when the author's colleagues share their brief insights to quick classroom management problems."
1,Fun to read but no real help.,I was looking for some help in managing some serious behavior issues in my classroom. This book didn't offer anything new or helpful.
1,Only if you're desperate,"If you have any intuition for teaching, this book offers little. So who has the time, really? While I did appreciate the suggestion that real teachers dress the part, I was rather unimpressed with the rest. If you're looking for guidance, though, and are a new teacher who doesn't trust her instincts, this might be worth the read."
1,Skip it,"I bought this thinking it would give me some guidelines on editing and proofreading (as in, what I should know to create a polished piece of writing before submitting it). Instead, I got lists which reminded me of when I studied for the SATs years ago. I understand that grammar and punctuation are important, however if that is the main thrust of this book, it should be mentioned in the title, so that potential buyers realize it is all they will be getting."
5,"Proofreading, Revising, and Editing","Proofreading, Revising, and Editing is a good, solid book of bite sized lessons/review for the anyone interested in improving their writing skills."
3,Not very instructive,"Unfortunately the main portion of this video is only 26 minutes long, and half of that is a ""music video""-style portion where the kids in the video are simply showing off without any instruction. So really, not counting the bonus sections of the video, there just isn't much instruction. The instruction portion is just learning a handful of dance moves without any progression. A few stars because the kids enjoyed it, but while they're interested in hip hop dance, they weren't interested in doing it again. As someone else mentioned, the video is *very* low budget and feels homemade."
4,"Simple, quick, fun","I purchased this and another kids dance dvd. This one is the easy quick one to learn. It's not the kid's favorite though. This one has quick dance moves that are very easy to do and learn. But again, it's not the one that my class likes to watch. But if you want to teach a few hip hop dance moves this one is great for beginners or for younger kids."
3,Cheesy,Cheesy and not worth $12. My preschoolers like it and it does get them moving though. We have fun making fun of it.
2,Ehhhh,It was not horrible but it was far from good. The dances are ok. It's a bit fast paced for younger kids.
4,I like it,"I am using it with Kindergarten children. It is a little tough for them to keep up, but most of the students enjoy it."
4,Fun for Kids and Parents,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. My brother actually gets up and dances with her! The songs they play are up to date and current songs and each dance is given a name (aka. ""the motorcycle"") and so it was easy for her to remember which was which. I will definitely buy the next one if one comes out!"
5,HIP HOP FOR KIDS: SCHOOL HOUSE HIP HOP (DANCE),THIS WAS A VERY GOOD DVD THE KIDS LOVE IT AND I DID TOOHip Hop For Kids: School House Hip Hop (Dance)
1,Not appropriate for school,"Was very disappointed with this video. Was expecting better dressed dancers (as the cover shows) but did not think the dancers and instructor were dressed appropriately for school use. Not as easy for kids to follow as other videos, and not as captivating. Poor video quality as well."
5,Pat the Bunny,This was a gift along with the book. I know it was a favorite for a little girls birthday and Easter!
3,Pat the bunny,"Although the picture does freeze it is seldom....but I did expect for a like new item that it wouldn't get ""stuck"" at all ....."
3,"Like snack foods, enjoyable but not sustaining","""One for the Road"" stripped to its core chronicles a 7,000-mile trek mainly by hitchiking around and across much of the desolate Australian intertior and coast. The author, Tony Horowitz caved in to his wanderlust and captured his beer-fueled adventure in a blur of small towns, depressingly endless pubs and truck stops, and glimmers of green and time-forgotten stopovers.He offers snapshot sketches of the many, varied people he rides with or meets in the towns and pubs, never delveing much into anyone's character or motivation and sometimes offering his judgment a bit too quickly after catching someone's face by the road or in an oncoming car.The book is like your favorite snack foods, enjoyable but not sustaining. I liked it but could not make a steady diet of this sort of nonfiction."
4,an entertaining first book,"As someone else remarked, Tony Horwitz has rapidly become one of my favorite writers. Having read all his books in the last few weeks, I was pleased to find that even in this first book, his humor, observational skills, and humanity are all in place.Yes, he has gotten better, or at least more polished, but part of my enjoyment in this book is being in on the beginnings of what has become a much longer journey than the hitchhike around Australia.Unlike another reviewer, I am surprised at how little he condescends in his sketches of the Australians he meets. (A trait that carries through his other books as well). He also does not condescend to us, the non-Australian reader, by throwing definitions or footnotes into the narrative. There's a useful glossary at the end of the book, which deftly answered the few questions I'd had.This one goes into the 'Australia' section of my bookshelf as a valued part of the collection."
1,does anyone have this?!?!,"I ordered the camera for this months ago and since then this item has gone out of stock ALL OVER the internet. To the previous reviewer, do you have this housing?? I know this review is not very helpful but the only advice I can offer is not to put all your eggs in one basket. Nikon.com says this was released years ago and yet there is not ONE place on the entire internet selling a new or used one. They all say out of stock with no sell dates in the near future...the camera is pretty useless to me without the underwater housing that I bought it with..."
5,"Truthful, passionate, and delicious","A pinch of Tori and a light splash of Fiona.. mix well. A touch of Groban for taste and you have a delicious sound all its' own with The Player & The Pawn. The passion of the music was heard from the piano's lovemaking and the lyrics stripped naked to truth, telling some of the most passionate stories of love and relationships in music today. Thank you Jonathan for opening your soul for sake of art and music."
3,Seems to fall asleep sometimes.,"Works fine but since I use it for several hard drives that I turn off when not used, when I turn them on I usually have to disconnect the usb and reconnect for it to recognize that the drive is turned on."
1,Deceiving,"Very deciving, you must read the fine print apparently. It said 1000/carton when you place the order but under technical it say 100/box. I would have never bought them if I know that!"
4,Monaco pink cell phone case,"Fits my Cingular 3125 very well, and the bright pink color is fun, and makes it easy to locate the phone in my purse etc. Other users complained that the cover is too thick to fit the charger in, but it has not been a problem for me. The belt clip makes it easy and functional to use; the missing star is because when you snap the phone back in the belt clip the button that holds the cover together snaps open...maybe velcro would have worked better??I recommend the case though."
3,A very buggy movie . . .,"As a long-time reader of science fiction, I greatly enjoyed Heinlein's novel when it first came out in my senior year of high school, even though I had reservations about the political slant. I was greatly disappointed in the film when it finally came out, however; most of the thoughtful themes that always made Heinlein enjoyable reading (whether you agreed with him or not) were missing, and the details of the alien ""bugs"" and the boot-camp training and so on were created from whole cloth with almost no reference to the book. It was just another ""alien menace"" movie. This book provides some answers -- mostly that it was a budget-driven film and anything that cost more money, especially complicated costuming (like the missing power-suits) and special effects, was simply dropped. And what that bought them was a very mediocre movie. Unfortunately, this is also a rather mediocre behind-the-scenes book."
5,R.I.P Flauge,To mamma Tammie and grandma Bessie i know its hard for yall just as it is hard for me cause i looked at hm as a role model and a brother when i would go to the studio.Camoflauge we Love u and miss u and when i do my cd u will have a song from meCouriousity
3,R.I.P,"To the family and friends of this talented young man, I send my regards and my condolences. It is a shame that this young man had to leave this earth at such a time as this at such and early age. I am praying for you and with you. God Bless you."
5,"Pure Pain.... ""Off the Heeezzzeee""","Camoflauge is one of the south's best new talents on the market. Unlike most albums, this album has substance. He constantly hits you with the fire lyrics, aided by the ""UNCUT BEATS"" that gradually lure you to continue to listen. So be on the lookout for more from camoflauge as well as ""Crime Affiliates"" and another New upcoming talent ""HEARTLESS HUSTLERS"" Straight out of STATESBORO GA baby. Pure Pain records is off the Meat Rack for da 2 triple o.Peace, BOB DIGI"
5,GA's Finest,"Flauge will forever be the hardest rapper in The port. In fact he is the hardest rapper in Ga. Flauge was the kind of rapper that I could relate to.When you listen to his Cd's he talks about problems we all through daily. All his Cd's are five stars because he tells how it is. Flauge was on his way to making it big and when he did he would have repped the port to the fullest.Camo died for the port and thats sad that he had to. RIP Camo, GA's finest."
3,cd con la nueva configuracion de Los Prisioneros,"Es un bun cd como un todo, volviendo a las raízes protestantes y con buen humor sin dejar de lado el rock.Sinceramente prefiero los 4 primeros. Para quien quiere conocer este grupo compre en orden cronologica para ver su verdadera historia."
4,Deadly Pursuit by Robert V. Cox,"When I picked up this book and began to read it, memories flooded back. This was written with such clarity, accuracy, empathy, truthfulness, heart-felt knowledge of the subject he was writing about. It was written in such a manner as to put you right there in the midst of the actions, from beginning to end. It made you feel the pain and anguish of all the terror that the people involved felt. No one can truthfully understand terror unless it has been experienced. Robert Cox with the written word and Ken Pieffer with his pictures in the newspaper made this book all the more read worthy. If anyone wants to be truly frightened read this book; then make sure that you check all of your windows and doors at night if you are alone.I live about 12 miles straight across the mountain from where this happened, and I remember how scared everyone was during this ordeal. this book brought it all flooding back."
5,PA MOUNTAIN MAN,"This is a very good book. These events actually happened before I was born, but I was raised in Shade Gap and knew a lot of the people these things happened to. My grandfather's sister was attacked by the mountain man (or Bicycle Pete as he was called in the area). I LOVE this book and would definately recommend it to anyone who is interested in local history."
4,Beautiful Recording,"I think these recordings are wonderful. Rich in history, clear in sound, present in dynamic's. Its major draw back was its length. I felt that songs were a bit short and the CD overall was a bit shorter than its predecessor."
3,Linux Compatible,I bought this device for my laptop that runs Linux. Finding a good wireless card to work in Linux was not always easy. This card worked right away.
1,Not what I ordered and wasn't available,"Very disappointed in this item. This was ordered specifically due to the crossed tennis racquets shown on the picture and in the description text of the item. I received a beverage cooler that had a blue plaid design and no racquets. I contacted the company but was told the item description plainly said blue which is simply not true. The picture available and the description both say red and with the Crossed Racquets. The person I spoke with said I could return the item but the original item requested was not available. This was a very inexpensive item and returning it would have cost as much as the purchase price. I've kept it, but will be very cautious of the vendor the next time. :("
4,Nice Quality!,"We ordered this hat to use for a Skipper's costume from Gilligan's Island, for a Halloween party. We didn't want the tacky costumes that are for sell out there! This is a nice hat, good quality, sturdy! Happy with the purchase!"
5,Halloween Approved,"My wife and I were the Skipper and Gilligan for a night. When we were off socializing independently, someone thought I was the Captain from the Captain and Tennille - so I might get to use this hat again! Good quality and quick delivery."
2,Not Quite What I had in Mind,"This hat is a ""costume"" hat. Good for wearing on halloween, even then it is very cheap. Before buying this hat, go to one of the cheap discount stores in town .. you will find the same thing there. Very cheaply made, pretty much junk."
4,Decent MultiFunction Printer,"This unit utilizes the BCi-3e ink tanks, creating high quality print output for the digital images taken direct through the card adapter.one note, this unit does not include an internal fax modem, as many consumers have noted as being ""ripped by Canon"". If you read the box and the specifications, you will note that the F50 and the F80 units include the internal fax modem.At the price you pay for this unit, you may be better off with the F50 or F80, depending on personal need for direct digital printing support.And yes, with all Canon products, the F60 (USB only), you must have all updated USB chipset drivers. That includes all consumers with Emachines, Compaqs or Via chipset motherboards. UPdate your stuff first and rip out any previously installed MultiFunction/printer software."
3,Printing Problems with the Canon Multipass F60,"The F60 prints and scans well. However, I have been unable to print while on the web. I get an error message which says, ""Unable to comminicate with the device."" I contactedCanon technical support and they were unable to offer a solution."
5,Excellent,Excellent book for an introduction of the subject to medical students. Gives many examples of interviews that are very helpful. Rapid reading.
3,Another textbook that medical mandates you to purchase,Just another textbook that medical mandates you to purchase. Check it out from the library and keep your money in your pocket. Quick read but dull at times.
1,This books sucks,"This book is a piece of doody. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It seems as if it was written for robots to teach them how to interact with human patients. If you have any social skills whatsoever, you do not need to buy this book."
1,"Tedious, Dull, and mostly common sense","I really loathe this book. It's a dull, slow read. It's full of ridiculously trite little examples. It will spend three full pages coming up with different ways to say ""appear caring."" An intelligent person could convey all the useful information in this book to someone in about 30 minutes.I have an exam I know is based almost solely on this book, and I still feel like I wasted money on it."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this book, hoping to see a fresh Asian American novel. I was pretty disappointed with the characters and storyline. They were both uninteresting and superficial. The stories left little to think about and I felt like they were an attempt at a Canadian ""Joy Luck Club"" (which I also did not like). We do not get a sense of life in Canada aside from the fact that it is cold and there are a lot of Caucasians. There is nothing special about this book."
3,"Stick with it, it gets better near the end","I found the first half of this book quite dull and slow-moving, and I almost gave up on it. I'm glad I didn't, though. The second half moves a good deal faster, and towards the end of the story there are a lot of surprises and twists and plots within plots.There were a lot of interesting characters here, but I can't say that it was better than Perdido Street Station.I did not care at all for the snobbish protagonist Bellis. I thought Tanner Sack made a better hero."
4,A tasty dark science fantasy goulash,"A marvel of dark fantasmagoria and a most colorful collection or potpourri of intriguing ideas.. It may be worth heeding other reviewer's warning - the first half of the book are truly fantastic. As others have said, the action in the second half, while moderately intriguing and competent, flattens and simplifies the marvelous portrait. Nevertheless worth reading."
2,Boring and depressing.,"As said in previous reviews, Meiveille's ability to craft words is brilliant. However, this ability to drag a plot to a full stop is also equally as powerful.Why bother to create a world only to have nothing happen within it? Why bother to craft characters only to have them sit sedately around and do nothing? Heck, the only likable creature, the avanc, is possible the most sympathetic character and I felt myself worrying about it more than the characters I was supposed to enjoy."
4,"Intriguing, but not as good as perdito street station","I like tough female characters that don't throw everything away for romance, and I think that's what drew me into this book. But, even though the premise was very interesting, and the suspense was tied blithely into the premise's weirdness, I don't think the novel reached it's full potential. Maybe the whole 'could've been this, could've been that' sort of climax reminded me too much of bad books where you think the protag's gonna die, and then he wakes up from his dream."
3,"More of the same, but very good.","China does a great job of expanding the story after the ending of Perdido Street Station. If you like his style of writing, this is a must read, but it is essentially more of the same."
4,Broken Kindle version,I liked the book ... The problem is that the Kindle software for Android doesn't display it correctly (the pages are too narrow).
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Take a peripheral character from Perdido Street Station. Throw her into a job that soon leads her into a fantastic floating city, that is on its own Moby Dick style quest.War, crime, local politics, possibility swords, covert action and more combine in this epic."
2,Is it just me?,"There's a lot of enthusiasm for this book and this author; Mieville's previous novel was even nominated for Hugo in 2002. However, I found the book very irritating to read. The book seems to take itself very seriously, but the ideas presented are either clichéd and uninspired, or not explored in depth. It's a shotgun approach to fantasy, and one that I did not enjoy. I've certainly read worse books, though.I thought that maybe I just didn't understand the world well, so I bought Perdido Street Station. The first few pages were so pretentious I couldn't put up with any more of it. I guess I'll never find out if that was the problem."
5,One of the most original science fiction minds at work today,"Hugely creative, breahtaking prose, frequently grotesque, always captivating."
3,Beautifully Written but No Investment,The high point of the book is the evocative and beautiful prose and interesting world building but ultimately I was not invested in the characters and my suspension of disbelief waned making the mounting unlikely coincidences and unconvincing plot developments harder and harder to bear.China Miéville is an excellent writer and I will read more of his stories but this one just did not catch my imagination.
2,Wow...,"I had to quit after about 100 pages in. The story just lags. I felt suffocated by so much detail that I couldn't even remember what was even happening at times. Don't get me wrong, the detail and wording is very, very well done, but in the midst of it all I just couldn't grasp on to anything. Even the so called ""action"" was lost in a hurricane of wordy descriptions. I'd like to give him another shot someday, but for now, this book is being put down and I'm moving on to something that will actually keep my interest."
3,My Wife Left me and all i got was this book,"Its just not the same. A companion, someone to share life with or this book... The book was good though and I recommend to anyone who is trying to decide whether they should get in a copper bathtub with a lamp. Come back to me baby - I didnt mean it..."
2,"No map, and no text-to-voice","The text-to-speech is disabled, showing a dislike for vision impaired people.The images of this are great and creative, but the twists and turns which don't pan out take a very long time, and you end of feeling ripped off after reading for 30 pages about something that turns out to be of little consequence."
5,Worthy but lesser followup to Perdido Street Station,"This is fantastic book. It contains the striking originality of Perdido Street Station, the multitude of races, the unique setting, complex plot & themes, and great writing. While Perdido was about New Crobuzon, The Scar is about Armada but it is also about the world of Bas-Lag. Rather than keeping you within the confines of a city, The Scar takes you across the ocean to strange islands and to fantastic places like nothing I've ever come across. Therein lies Mieville's unparalelled strength. He has the ability to take the reader to new realms to look at overwrought thing like vampires, wizards, monsters, and even epic fantasy in new ways.I said that it was a lesser book than Perdido Street Station. I can only qualify that by saying that Bellis Coldwine isn't the hero that Isaac was, the plot wasn't as gripping as the slake-moths, and ultimately that I was already familiar with Bas-Lag."
3,Interesting...,"Big fan of his playing in Faith No More, but it sounds like he just threw this one together. Go out and buy Faith No More's Angel Dust or The Real Thing to hear Jim's best work. His vocals are interesting, kinda Weird Al'ish or Mastadonish...if you can meet those two (lol). CD says HQ audio but it sounds like a kinda crummy mix to me. Drummer is subpar, as is the bass (which you can barely hear in most songs)."
1,"Great guitar player, terrible cd",You know who he is but this solo cd is aweful. Not only does it sound bad but the songs and vocals are horrible.
4,The Return of Ex-Faith No More Guitarist Jim Martin,A must for any fan of Ex-Faith No More guitarist Jim Martin. Milk & Blood rulez.
4,Good Work,"I got turned on to Jim Martin by listening to his CD with Anand Bhatt ""CONFLICT"" This CD has some pretty heavy music. I recommend you listen to them both back to back, this one second."
1,Pass on this one,"Zero, this book is not as good as dozens of free web logs. Tons of grainy B&W pictures. This is just the slim log of someone heading south. Not detailed. Read the Editors review and you have the entire book. This book can be read in morning over coffee. I can only think of one book worse than this one that took my money. I'm sure Joan is a nice person but this is not a book worth the even half the cover price."
2,Love the Twins. Hate the DVDs.,"Okay, so I thought I was getting a helluva deal when I purchased this item. It had vintage World Series footage from both 1987 and 1991...as a huge Twins fan that seemed like a great deal.Unfortunately, it's basically just the exact footage--undoctored, unrestored, etc--from back in the day. The same corny announcers. The same crappy quality. Although they did add a bunch of really, really, REALLY lame music to ""spice things up"" a bit.I thought I was getting a far more modern, sleek updated video package chronicling the Twins two improbable World Series runs, instead I received a compilation video I could have made myself.Boooooooooooooooo!!"
4,Electronics Order,"I was able to find the carrying case, bluetooth earpiece,and adapter for my motorola Q. My items arrived earlier than expected although the cost for my items very lower in price than on any other site....."
1,None,I've read enough of this book to know I wouldn't pay a plug nickel for it. It's simply more of the Goebbel's~inspired propanda spread by the Marxist radical left to terrorize and tyrannize the American public into handing over their God-given individual rights in exchange for some security. God help their wretched souls.
1,Here we go again...,"This book was required reading for me in my Political Science class over 20 years ago when I was in college. By this point in human history, humanity was supposed to be doomed. I agree with a previous reviewer who pointed out that the authors simply fail to take into account human ingenuity and the resilience of the planet and its inhabitants.But hey, if you want to incessantly worry and fret, this book is probably for you."
4,ST_SD,A rather interesting book of System Dynamics and System Thinking thoughts and also a must read book when reflecting on some deeper problems.
4,"The ""New"" Limits to Growth book","Limits to Growth gives an updated version of the original paper/book.It goes into enough detail to be informative, but does not get bogged down in just one aspect or topic.Seems to be a wake-up-call for all of us to be more informed, more in touch with everything that we do andtake for granted in our American lifestyle, and gives some concrete suggestions about what to do about it.Certainly worth the time spent reading it.If it does nothing more than make us aware of how fragile our life (style) is, it is worth the investment.Read it, enjoy it, but take it to heart and DO something about it!"
4,Sad update with death of main author,"Maybe the last version. Not much different from the 20-year update, but interesting to see how reports and outlook has changed since 1970."
5,Damu ridas,I LOVED THIS CD.ITS ALL ABOUT THA BLOODS.MY FAVORITE SONGS WERE FU** CRABS AND DAMU RIDE BUT ALL SONGS WERE JUST TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT.THROW UP DA B CROSS OUT DA C.PEACE TO ALL MY FELLO BLOODS.
1,CRIP CRIP CRIP,"YOU SLObS ARE FUNNY AS HELL, THIS CD IS WEAK AS FUCC LOCC, 187 ON ALL YOU DEAD FLAG WEARIN HOES CUZZ. LET IT RAIN, LET IT FLOOD, LET A CRIP KILL A bLOOD, LET IT RAIN, LET IT DRIP, bUST A SLOb IN HIS LIp. WE ARE ALL CRIPS IN PITTSBURGH CUZZ, COME C US CUZZ."
2,not a very good c.d,i bought this c.d and it doesnt have but one good song and thats number 11. stick to no limit if you gonna listen to rap
3,There's no jury when you are a Conservative,"Ferguson is an ""intellectual"" darling of the New Right, but his powers of foresight are shaped by old prejudices. When will the Cons learn that the world does not simply repeat itself? A Gibbon he ain't, but then again neither is the trans-atlantic Republic a modern-day caricature of the Roman Empire...C.G. PanagidisAthensm Greece"
4,Eastern Front Vampires,"When I first saw this book on the store shelf I thought the combination of WW2 on the Russian front and vampire tales more than a little silly. However, being a war story and horror story fan and having a special interest in the Eastern front, I had to take a closer look at this book. After reading some of the earlier good reviews, I took a chance and got a copy from Amazon. I loved it. The story line is very clear and the writing is smooth with just enough character development and historical perspective to keep the story moving at a good pace and maintain reader interest. I found a lot of the historical locations and details true to my knowledge of the military equipment and this area of the war, especially the siege of Leningrad. Things may have been ""all quiet on the Western Front"", but they were definitely wild and bloody in this trilogy, fictional account of combat life with a dark twist on the different fronts that made up the Eastern campaign."
4,A tribute to tenacity,This was an inspiring read to me. Glen Bell like Wendy's founder Dave Thomas did not have an easy childhood. Both developed and appreciated the values of hard work at an early age and this book shows that nice guys do finish first. While it is a very light fast read unlike a book about someone like Dr. Linus Pauling. This book teaches one that if you have an idea you should pursue it relentlessly and deal with everyone fairly as Glen did. Glen Bell never started out to be the richest or most famous person in the fast food business but he made major contributions to the industy with his ideas and simple honest values. While I continue to eat at upscale mexican restaurants frequently I do confess to eating at Taco Bell on a weekly basis. Thank you Glen Bell!
5,Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story,Compelling and well written story of a man who started in poverty and made his fortune providing the world with affordable quality tacos.
2,Welcome to 1970,"This book is comprehensive, for being written in 1970, which is the copyright/publish date inside this book. This is a reprint, and does not cover engines or technology past 1970. There isnt a single mention of the Volkswagen Type 4 engine that came out after the book was originally published.The information this book does contain, is logical and well explained, however I was really hoping it covered the Type 4 and more modern technology, such as modern fuel injection and turbo chargers. There is a section on superchargers, and a single page on fuel injection for the Type 3, but at most they recommend that you be sure to take all the parts of the fuel injection system if you scavenge it from another motor, including the ECU.Not the book for anyone looking for info on the Type 4. An ok book for any of the other aircooled engines."
3,Ok!,This book is outdated for todays aircooled VW engine technology. Good book for starters. I wouldn't try to build a big cc motor from it though.
3,outdated but interesting history of aircooled vw performance.,"Interesting from a historic perspective, but technology marches on. Needs a new edition that covers the last 20 years of performance improvements."
4,The basics of aircooled VW hotrodding can be found here...,Bill Fisher's book is what most VW fans start out with. It may be outdated (written in 1971 I believe). The current printing has no updates and lists some catalogues as being 50 cents. The information is what most people will find interesting. Once you understand what Bill is talking about you can learn more by participating in online VW forums like the Cal-Look Forum on the net. There are lots of people out there willing to help with advice and information.
4,Basics of VW Hotrodding!,"Start with this book if you want to know how to increase the efficiency of your VW engine. You must be patient as this book is a bit outdated. However, many of the ideas here can still be used today. A good buy for any VW enthusiast."
3,Good but outdated.,"If you are looking for something to help you choose from modern aircooled vw performance parts this is not really the book for you. The engine used for most of the tests in the book is a 1500 single port with single oil relief, the book only touches on dual port heads and dual oil relief cases. Although this book is outdated their is still a lot of good information."
2,Ancient history,"This book is based on information from the 1970's, and much of it is woefully out of date. Parts they describe are out of production."
4,Good Audio Program,"Good insights into what it takes to attain wealth. You only need one product, there are alot out there so choose wisley. Robert Stuberg has hit the nail with this one, althought it is from a few years back, alot of it is still relevent in todays world"
5,A Helpful and Clarifying Book,"When I caught my husband on the Internet I wasn't sure what to make of it. I felt hurt, confused, and betrayed. I wasn't sure if I could trust him again, and was skeptical about our relationship. I read this book and things became much clearer to me. It helped me figure out what was going on, what my own feelings were, and how to talk with my husband. I'm happy to report we are working things out. The book got to the core of our problems and gave me stories along the way to let me know I was not alone. I highly recommend this book to anyone in my situation."
3,Too outdated to help now,"The first half of this book basically explains the internet, what chat rooms are, why people go online, etc. Now everyone knows about the internet & how to use it so this book is outdated. It would be nice if the author updated it as there is no other book specifically about online cheating. I had to resort to books about standard cheating. Although they helped in some areas it's a different deal. I wish someone would write an updated book not just about cheating on the internet through porn, not just about how people online have emotional affairs, but also about those who have phone sex &/or cheat by using web cams without an emotional attachment or any real attachment at all. A book about how & why people do this with hundreds of other people but not necessarily ""seeing"" the same ones over and over. That would really be helpful."
4,Disturbing but helpful,Investigating and trying to understand the dark world of internet infidelity this book has been a real eye-opener. It has helped me understand that the parties taking part all justify and rationalize their activities the same way while allowing me to feel that my feelings are the same as most injured parties. It is disturbing but helpful on the road back to getting a damaged relationship back on track.
1,Very poor quality tea,This is very poor quality tea. Try Alghazaleen Tea if you want the good stuff. This tea literally tastes like dirt. Don't waste your money unless this is your regular brew!
3,Need a Little More,"Mattive covers the basics of investing for the beginner, but the coverage is too minimal. Even the beginner requires more information than is provided in this new book.One good point is that he attempts to teach the new investor about options, a topic that is too often omitted in such books. For additional help with conservative uses for options, I recommend The Short Book on Options."
5,The best book ever,This book teaches you how to handle anything in life. Its a book you should read go back and consult very often.
5,Dynamic,"Normally, I'm not prone to commenting on any such product on Amazon. This treasure, Robert Greene's masterpiece, however, keeps me entertained and informed to this day. With common-sense language and prolific research, Robert Greene has produced a 'must read' series of historical anecdotes, inspiring lessons, and dynamic strategical insight.I highly recommend."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Ok, I admit, the book was well researched and written well.. but just how many of us feel(or want) our days as a War to be won/lost as Mr Greene suggests in the book? All of us pretty much get what we expect in life otherwise known as the phenomenon of the self fulfilling prophecy. If this is the case, I shudder to think that a leader/manager of XYZ company considers his employees as mere soldiers in a War and the customers as enemies. Hmmm.. not very practical, if you ask me."
4,good for war or the like,"This book makes ""The Art ofWar"" usable. Whereas, I've read the ""Art of War"" I couldn't readily apply it. This makes it applicable. I don't know if I can use this info in life....but,I might be able to....but this gives me insight into aggressive business types. Just like ""The 48 Laws of Power"" this could be viewed as the ""bad guys"" playbook."
4,An Inspiring Read For Those Who Want To Suceed In Life,"This book was very exciting for me because I am quite the history buff, and I also like short and precise quotes that can say so much in just one sentence. This book will name a strategy in one quote and you'll think, wow that really makes sense. By reading that one strategy you can learn a great lesson and apply it to your life and reap the benefits. But the author gives us historical examples which apply to each strategy he writes about, so as to confirm the point he's making for each one.The order of the strategies is important as well, for in the end you are led to an interesting conclusion.The strategies you'll learn in this book will help you in the work place, and will also help you in sports. Whatever goals you aim to reach, the wisdom to be gained from this book will help you reach them."
4,Another tour through history,"I loved 48 laws of power ( after I got past the shock of reading a truly amoral book. 33 Strategies isn't quite as good. I have been trying to think about why and my guess is that Robert Green is just not a top military strategist and when he keeps saying you must this and you must that, my intuition is just sharp enough to have a bit of doubt.The short history clips are great, I enjoyed them just as much as I did in 48 laws. By the time I got to chapter 18 ( about 2/3 of the way through the book), they were really all I was reading."
5,Excellent Book -,"As ""an older professional"" I am usually a bit cynical about books of this sort -- usually pretty superficial stuff. Not so with this book. Very well done, few errors, well written and thought provoking. I highly recommend it."
5,GOOD READING!,"This product is worth reading for anyone over the age of 18. It really gives an insight about life. It is very educating, and worth every penny!"
4,Fun Reading,"Fun reading, great characters and an interesting twist at the end! John Peel is a good writer. The next books in the series are to be published soon. (...)"
5,This is a review about Diadem #6,"I love this series. I think #6 is the best one. For the people who have not read this book, I will talk a bit about it. A evil magichan takes Pixel(a magician) away from his friends(magicans). Pixel ends up in Zarathan the world of nightmares, where all your nightmares come true. Score and Heleine use all there energy to find Pixel, but they have a lot of trouble because they can not fall asleep or they will fall asleep for ever. In the end Pixel gets saved. Then they all go back to there magican friend and her pet Blink and they fall asleep."
5,Excellent Book,"I rarely purchase books unless they're used due to the cost. I have actually paid full price for all of these books. I have the entire set and enjoy each one. My son is also reading them and is always looking for the newest one out. These are superb books and can be used in a classroom setting as well as home. The puzzles in the books are good for critical thinking. I highly recommend this series for any child who reads, enjoys magical characters and a good story. The print font makes it very comfortable on the eyes as well."
5,"Sorry, I messed up a little in my last review","The word that was totally unreadable was skelatons, That you can read, Pixel does NOT fight them, Helaine and Score do, Pixel gets back his skin color and ears(Gruesome to anyone who hasn't read book 5) and Helaine gets back her clothes (I'm not thinking about what you must be thinking) to her great relief, she needs her sword for her nightmares, Score yells at her, and I think Score is mad because of the wild dogs...or monsters...Oops, I'm giving away to much, BYE!"
1,Didn't work for me,"I'm a caucasian male who is tired of shaving every day and still scratching up my girlfriend whenever we kiss. Therefore, I gave this product a shot. I followed the directions to the tee, but it didn't take any portion of the hair off of my face. Not one. I was amazed that it was so ineffective as I had heard good things about it. I must have some kind of super beard."
3,Doesn't really work.,I've used this like every other day for the past 2 weeks and for the past 4 days i used it every day. My beard isn't that thick but i guess my hairs are strong or something cause it isn't working. It takes off a little hair but that's it. And i even left it on for like a half hour today. However if you really load it on there like a LOT of it. It takes off a decent amount. It ex foliates your skin too. I MIGHT get it again after i use up this tube.
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I gave this cream a try. I tried it twice.It didn't work.I'm a male with very thick beard that grows very fast.I followed the instructions to the letter.It did NOTHING to my beard. And it didn't remove any beard hair AT ALL.Yes, it did burn my skin, had discomfort, and bad-looking skin for a week but it wasn't too bad, i.e.: not a big deal.I wish it had worked. The idea is great!So...If you hair is thin and slow to grow, this MIGHT work for you.If you are a man or woman with a REAL BEARD: forget it!"
2,Doesn't work for me,I have fairly thick hair (but not a really dense beard). I followed the directions exactly and tried it 1.5 after my last shave; it didn't remove a single hair (not one!). All it did was leave a red spot. Maybe the extra-strength red powder works (not for sensitive skin I'd guess ;-))?2 stars because it clearly works for some people. Just not for me.
1,Molten lava in a bottle,"This product got rid of some of my hair. However, my face is now swollen and bright red. For a short period before putting on lotion my face was also bleeding. Had hopes for this product."
3,Works but takes longer...,"I have used this porduct for many years now and it works OK. The problem is that I leave it on for 30 minutes at a time. If I were to leave it for just 6-9 minutes, I would have zero results. A touch up with a blade is necessary but with the smoothness of the shave afterwards, its not that bad. The product could be better but I have not used a blade alone for the vast majority of my adult life."
1,"95% Ineffective, 100% useless","I tried this to get a smoother shave. I don't have a heavy beard. My first attempt, I left it on for the full nine minutes. After scrubbing it off with a washcloth, I found that it hadn't removed 95% of the hair on my face. I tried again the following day with the same results. It's useless but at least it wasn't too expensive."
1,No effect whatsoever,"I'm happy for people who seem to get good value from this product, but apparently it simply does not work at all for some of us.I'm a caucasian male, and I tried to use it on my beard. I have now tried it twice (plus the small ""test patch"" to make sure I'm not allergic to it). As far as I can tell, neither attempt removed any hair at all. I do not have a particularly thick or stiff beard; I'm just tired of shaving (and cutting, and scraping) my neck....and now I'm curious. Is this product really only intended for other parts of the body, and I should have known that (wink wink)? Are there different beard chemistries? Do I need to be using three times as much product? Enquiring minds want to know..."
1,3 strikes and your out,"I was looking for a product to save me some shaving time, and thought this would work.I am white Caucasion, with rregular beard growth. Not heavy, but I need to shave everyday.I tried this product before taking a shower so I could be sure to remove all the product.I let it work for 6 min, wiped it off and there was all my beard still happily on my face.Next day I tried 9 minutes, same effect..beard still there.The last try I did in the morning, for 7 minutes and the results were the same, except i didnt shower after.WRONG MOVE, even though I rinsed my face well, it began to burn and i was forced to shower to get the stuff off my face.Back to the drawing board."
4,Better than a razor!!!,"So this is a little embarrassing, but why not disclose this... it is the internet, right? I use this to get rid of unwanted hair. This includes but is not limited to: Groin, back, and chest hair. It works great with no bad skin rashes."
4,works great but I don't use it on my face....,"I am a caucasion female but I use this instead of having to pay $50 to get a brazillian wax and it works great. I leave it on a few extra minutes but it totally takes off hair. You have to goop it on pretty thick but it doesn't burn at all so it's not a problem. I do find that if you use soap straight after, then it burns a little bit so I use a washcloth to get it off and then wait a bit to shower so that the soap doesn't sting. It smells like perm at a salon so not that fantastic but definitely a cheap solution to avoid expensive waxes (although waxing lasts longer.)"
2,Not for me...,"I have read reviews that this is also good on bikini lines, so I tried it. It just left patches of hair on my bikini lines and legs. It made my skin itchy after an hour I used it. I guess, that's why this is originally made for men only."
5,The President's Story ( verbally told by him from his interviews ),This is a good geniune real bio of the President. He tells his own story verbally to David Frost. He is a gentle warm soft spoken humble person. He will be remembered in history as one of the best President we ever had( not as great as Lincoln or Washington). I recommend this to everyone to see.
3,"Arcade version, not a sim","If you want to play football without much control depth then choose this over the European ""Pro Evolution Soccer 4"" (title is ""Winning 11"" in the US) and if you have heard the buzz surrounding that game then you should know that it is in the top three sports simulations of all time.Winning 11 however is not an out-of-box game, taking days to learn, weeks to master and then improve on with other players. FIFA works straight out of box, is easy, but its limits become all too obvious in light on Winning 11, a game has been in development since the Nintendo 64 and is easily the best soccer engine out there.The bottom line is that if you want a soccer game that works out of box, that you can play almost right away with anybody, then FIFA has it. If you want a real soccer sim that takes longer to get into but is far better, then choose Winning 11."
1,Trust Your In-Stinks on This One.,"There's a reason that there are 95 copies of this from $0.01 on Amazon Marketplace. Save your penny, unless you need a coaster and can't find one for cheaper. It's just not very good."
2,Not what they said it was!,They called it (Factory-Reconditioned)all I got was a damaged welder that was never reconditioned at all!!! It had broken parts and a damaged case. Looked like they recieved it damaged and just reshiped back out to a dummy like me. will never buy from any of them again and will let all my friends and coworkers know about this type of rip off.
4,If you like spirits.....,"I am a firm believer in the ""spirit world"", and always love reading Mason Winfield's books. He lives near Buffalo, NY -where I am from- and have spoken to him personally. He shakes up your ""spiritualism"" and even throws in a few laughs when telling tales from our local area. I enjoyed reading the book and find his info very interesting!"
3,OK mic stands. Not Heavy Duty.,Good price for 6 stands and a bag. I have used them for a year. 1 has broken. A drummer that didn't loosen the clutch on the boom kept moving it till it failed. He now has to purchase his own stand.
3,Sonor Drummer,"This is not a heavy duty mic stand by any means, I am using them in my Studio and they work fine but they probably won't hold up with a lot of set up and tear downs of doing shows."
1,Don't waste your money,Every single one of these stands broke in either one place or another. Screws stripped. Metal pieces broke off. A nightmare. I've spent more time trying to fix these stands than actually using them.Go spend a few more dollars for better made stands.Horrible.
3,Not very helpful for the Western rider,"I realize many techniques of English riding are transferable to Western, but, as a Western rider trying to improve my seat and aids, I found this book frustrating and unhelpful."
5,Great Instructional Book,"Wonderful supplement to a riding lesson program for the equine enthusiast. Helpful illustrations and easy to understand text, great book."
3,For English Riding - Not Western,"I've been learning Western riding and bought this book to help me learn. However this is for English Riding. If you are learning English, it's lovely. If not, you should look elsewhere. I'm giving the three star rating because neither the title nor the product description mention this."
5,love them,"they glide on easily and feel good on, holds you in all the right places, comes up high over the stomach and back part and there is no giggle, I've lost some weight and will order another in a smaller size to accomodate me."
1,Worst MCDM book,I was really surprised how such a book can be published. It deals only with AHP! AHP! AHP! [If you would like to know more about Analytic Hierarchy Process[AHP] - Just buy books written by Saaty ] and very little about other decision making techniques . Triantaphyllou's book has no organization and clear structure. Believe me you will end up learning nothing from this book. There are several other good books which are available better look for it folks
1,don't get your hopes up...,"I thought this product was a cheaper alternative to the other options for converting XLR to 3.5mm, despite the fact that it does work. It is extremely easy to break (the wire that connects the 3.5mm to the XLR plug) commonly comes apart, then one needs to resoder. If you are a person who has a cam with a 3.5mm jack and looking for an XLR adapter. As far as $$$ goes; your better off going with the beachtek DXA4."
2,Just sayin'...,"I am only going by my personal experience. I realize most other reviewers fared better. I had an easier time soldering a cheaper version than the Neutrik model. Again, maybe I lack the necessary skills and, perhaps, I didn't watch enough videos on Youtube or, maybe, I need to upgrade my soldering iron but the cheap, plasticky, plug I ended up using was much easier to work with, even though it didn't look as pretty as this one.My biggest hurdle is trying to get the solder to stick, even after using flux.In any case, even if it is my lack of skill, I think these plugs should be no more than a couple of bucks each (I probably paid, after shipping and handling, between 5 and 10 dollars for one plug). I have bought 3.5mm plugs before and I've never had to pay this much, no matter the beautiful and practical curved design. Perhaps due to excessive heat on my part, the ground metal tip broke off but the price issue remains..."
5,"Great repair of very nice headphones, like new now","One bit of advice, the red wire goes to the tip, blue to the ring. Easy to solder. Wire seems secure with no tension on the solder points. Great way to repair expensive ear buds. No static."
5,Neutrik 3.5 mm right angle plug,"This is a very high quality plug for projects such as rewiring a headphone plug. I used a ""helping hands"" type fixture to hold the plug and the wire and it made soldering a snap."
3,soldering required!,"From the picture I was assuming that your microphone jack plugged into the other end, and that this was an extension of sorts. Nope. This jack is a replacement for whatever jack you currently have on your microphone. You must cut off the old one, strip the wires, and SOLDER them to this jack. The stripped wires are very, very small and unless you do this regularly, it is actually quite challenging. It took me three tries before I got it working, mainly because the instructions included were extremely brief and inadequate. It was a process of trial and error to discover which wire had to be soldered where. I finally found a short pdf from the manufacturer explaining how the wires needed to be connected.Other the the difficulty I had in attaching it, it's a good little jack. The one I received is not black like in the picture though. The one I received is silver and made of metal."
1,Ignorant,"I found this book to be an ignorant and offensive. It's basically a description of Shaeffer's personal taste in art, with justifications for his particular view, that are without merit, and clearly that of someone who knows little about art beyond his personal preference. Everything Shaeffer doesn't like or doesn't understand is termed ""below the line of despair"" (i.e. happy music, or music in a major key is ""good"", and sad music, music in a minor key or dissonance is ""bad"") . In my opinion it is the book that is below the line of despair and is an excellent example of why people are put off by Christians, as they attempt to sell their personal preferences and opinions as gospel, which it most definitely is not. Not all Christians are this judgmental and ignorant."
4,Got a good deal,"This book has been very meaningful to me since the early 80's, and continues to be so. I love the way it offers reasoned answers and responses to valid questions regarding Christianity. Ordered this one for a young friend who is wrestling with her faith. I was happy with the condition of the book and the shipping."
2,not satisfied,First time poster here!I ordered 3 of these. One had a flawed seal. I contacted the company and they said they would send a replacement lid. I never got it.Avoid this company!
2,Tall Pasta Canister,"Just too flimsy for my use.Very heat sensitive. If you set it near the stove it will melt in a flash.Other products from the same maker suffer the same tragedy. Large canisters are easily crushed when picked up with heavy foods in them.I have only one item left from the set. I store very lightweight biscuit cutters in it.I've gone back to using re-purposed PVC containers that deli salads, pickles, etc. originally came in."
4,"Great style, great fun","Allred's artwork is simple, strong and compelling. Madman is one of the more fun, albeit quirky, books that you will read. All of the collected Madman works are worth checking out, but this one, along with the 4th collection: G-Men From Hell are my favorites.Fans of Allred's work on X-Force will definitely want to check this out. Madman lacks the cynicism and underlying complexity of X-Force, but Allred's optimistic, light hearted, hero shines in the Madman books."
3,Fun,"This has always been a fun film. While the acting is not the best, the script and especially Clayton Rohner are great."
3,Just One of the Guys,"Very much a movie of the Eighties, this light look gives a glimpse at another time. Nothing exciting, just a slower moving story about feminism and romance. A young lady thinks she has been slighted at a shot working for a newspaper for the summer. Supposedly by less qualified writers, guys namely. She decides to take it to another school to enter it and pretends to be a guy. Although in fact her paper doesn't cut it there either. Now the story centers on her failing romance with her old boyfriend because of her independence and her new romance with a guy she was friends with first as a guy. You have to be patient with this one and be into 1980s nostalgia and preferably a girl or you may not appreciate it. Worth a rental. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Sixteen Candles"". Decent quality DVD with some replayability if you love all 80s movies."
4,"the movie is great (5 stars), but the dvd is okay.","Well first of all, this dvd has a glitch in it. When Terry(Joyce hyser) enters the school as a guy now, u see a quick flash of light right before, she meets the blonde bully guy. Its a second glitch but, it should have been checked before release! The other thing is, people say that it was open matte shot, the movie, but when the movie begins it says This film has been modified from its original version, the widescreen version. So columbia where is the widescreen version??????? Other than that i recommend the movie/dvd!"
4,Buddy Rules!!!,"The best part of this movie, and the best reason to buy it, is sex-crazed Buddy. The perfect hormone driven teenager, Buddy spends the entire movie harassing women in his pursuit to lose his virginity. The rest of the characters are OK too."
2,Get it off your chest,"JUST ONE OF THE GUYS delivers a few cute jokes and one-liners. But it mostly kills time until the big moment when actress Joyce Hyser, disguised as a teen-age boy, reveals her actual gender. Watching the film's opening swimsuit scene, I wondered how JUST ONE OF THE GUYS would use the physical beauty of Ms. Hyser in the I'm-a-girl revealing scene. Well, ""reveal"" is what Ms. Hyser does. Could you imagine if the filmmakers of TOOTSIE had asked Dustin Hoffman to do the equivalent?"
2,Very average Very 80's,"first off of all Joyce Hyser did a great job in the film and Looked very Good.but the Gender-Bender thing was very tacky in spots.this was formula early 80's when this type of film was Popular.the Gender-Bender films.Like Tootsie,Victor,Victoria,All of Me, etc.. this time it's done in a tenny bop film.the styles&music are very 80's."
1,No Widescreen Version!,I ordered this movie 2 times and put Just One of the Guys WIDESCREEN in the subject line and both vendors sent it FULLSCREEN. I then find out there is no widescreen version. Had I known that I wouldn't have ordered it until a widescreen version came out! Very disappointing. One vendor said it says fullscreen in the description and yes that was right but I had the misconception that if I put WIDESCREEN in the search box the widescreen version would come up just like I have for other movies and I was wrong so I will keep the movie anf give it to someone that likes fullscreen. The one star is for the ordering procedure not following what version I ordered and not the movie.
1,Full frame only!!!!,"Figures Columbia would release this full frame only, shame on you! This ""major"" studio does this often with their catalog DVDs.Columbia, release this film in widescreen! I won't buy it unless it's in OAR!"
1,can't review what I havent received,"IF you are into 80's movies, then this should be part of your collection. I would write a review, but the company never sent me my movie. The order was place back in Feb and it still have not come in yet. One review I can write is that the company i order this from (DVDLEGACY)I would not order anything else from them, and I would not recommend it to no one else!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The pinnacle of 80's teen comedy,"Predictable, but loveable. The acting is poor, the characters are shallow, the jokes are lowbrow. This film totally lacks the depth of The Breakfast Club, but also its retentiousness. Precisely because it doesn't make you think, can let you just sit back and laugh at the contrived hijinks. Quotable and lovable."
3,"Not the best 80's movie, but it's very entertaining....","This is a pretty good movie to kill a couple of hours on a saturday morning. It's funny and keeps you interested even if it is quite predictable.it's a very 80s movie! right down to the clothes and the cheesy background music.Billy Jacobi plays the younger brother, Buddy. He is the comic relief of the film and I laugh alot at his character.Ayre Gross, who was on the show Ellen, plays one of the geeks'. He thinks he's an alien. Also, A very young Sherilynn Fenn plays in this movie as a sex starved teen after the male ""Terri"". She is cute, and this is a cute film that spawned from the 1980s."
3,"Now, Joyce, put those helmets down...","Teen reporter, feeling dismissed by her journalism teacher because of her gender, disguises herself as a boy to write an undercover piece. Along the way falls in love with her new best friend. Joyce Hyser is totally unbelievable as a man. but she does give us the obligatory tatas shot at the end. And prances around in her undies in the opening credits. And isn't that what 80's teen comedies were all about? Yes indeed ;) JOOTG is an OK, if marginal, example of the genre. You won't feel like you wasted 90 minutes when it's over. Legendary jazz/break artist Tom Scott did the score? Wow. No extras besides the trailer. Print looks nice, but it's another fullscreen rushjob from a studio who couldn't care less about putting quality into their products. Mild recommend."
4,Very Funny!!!,"I saw this on tv a few hours ago, and I thought it was really good! Although I missed the first half, I got what was going on. Sexy beautiful Joyce Hyser did an awesome job as playing a girl, dressing up like a guy. She plays a journalist who thinks that her teachers don't take her seriously because she is a woman. She disguises as a dude. She helps Rick get a girl, and she has girls hitting on her. Soon, she begins to fall in love with Rick, but he thinks she is a man. If you love gender-bender comedies, you'll love JUST ONE OF THE GUYS!!!"
4,Great flick must see comedy film.,"This movie was one of my favorites. She does the one thing she has to do to become a noticed writer. Which was being a guy!!! Before she was a portrayed as a male, everyone assumed she was nothing but all good looks and no brains. She proves them all to be wrong when she comes up with greatest article in the end. A must see for 80's movie fans."
1,80's comedies...ugh,"It was not funny whatsoever and the acting was barely passable. I have actually said that the 80's feature some of the most awful films, and when it comes to comedies, that is no exception. This movie was cringe-worthy, truly. And completely ridiculous. I mean, she looked more of a woman than I do, and I have long hair! Ok, I am exaggerating, but my point is that the whole scenrio is ridiculous and it makes watching this movie pointless."
1,Poorly written no plot,It was not at all what i expected. no point to it. And poorly written with a bad cast.
1,Just One of the Guys,"Sadly before there was a Chaz Bono(or As I like to use something phallic related for the name)there was this,I like the movie but the crossdressing I don't care for,frankly I am not pc when it comes to transgender and knowing one's place,Shame the girl is beautiful then she wants to go all butch and cassidy on us.It's not the innuendo I have a problem with,Could have been better instead it's one of those Men or rather AntiMen are so much luckier than women Myths."
2,The Movie is not a Classic !,"I have this movie on DVD and it ain't that great for the people who think that this movie is a classic has got it all wrong and it has no classic lines, no classic characters and classic story. If you really want the classic flims on DVD go get the John Hughes flims and next time I learned not to get these lesser known flims of the 80's like this unfunny flim."
5,I LOVE THIS FILM!!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS FILM!!!!!!! I hope that its in widescreen, itd be nice to see it in its theatrical aspect ratio for the first time. If its fullscreen thats fine because it was shot open matte, as many 80s movies were filmed!!!! If u dont have this on DVD, then go and get it right away!!!!!!"
5,fun movie,"this is kind of an oldie of ""shes the man"" with amanda bynes. fun movie from the 80s. love it!"
4,"""Kim reads Vonnegut, and Luanne? Luanne despises toxic waste.""","An 80s teenage sex-romp with some funny moments. It's b-grade material, but still endearing on a certain level, even if it does have a little bit of excess nudity and sexual content.It means well and entertains. There's a number of classic lines, and the story itself is a watchable classic rehash of a female infiltrating male ranks to find out ""how the other half lives"" by disguising herself as a member of the opposite sex.I don't have too much to say about it, other than I'm glad it's a plain fun and entertaining film. See it once."
5,Taking investigative reporting to a new level,"This movie compliments my collection of classic eighties comedy films. It kind of takes you back to those funny school day dramas we all have as students in the classic American public school system. All in all great movie! Just One of the Guys is Just One of those movies I could not live without, although I would also like to see it available in widescreen format."
5,i love the 80's,"This movie is soooooooooo funny. I watched it so many times as a kid. Everyone should see this movie adleast once. Don't take it too seriously. Yes she looks like a girl dressed as a boy, but I think it works for the film."
4,THE MOVIE IS A CLASSIC,"I love ""Just one of the guys"". It's funny and also a romatic movie all in one. The ""girl"" is great in it and so is her brother."
3,THE BROTHER & NERDS RULE!!,"this film was a lot better than i expected, but the girls boyfriend wasnt nasty enough for you to her to ditch .. her brother had all the best lines in this film and the nerds (one who looked uncannily like j cusack!)played their parts great.i did think the exposing of knockers at the end wasnt really needed but all in all if youre into teen films you will want to see it."
1,*Full screen*?!?,"I've waited for this film to come out on DVD for a while, and I was intending to buy it... but now that it did come out, it's only in Moron Format (alias ""full screen""). I wouldn't want a full screen DVD for free - why would I pay for one? I'll be waiting for a proper release of ""Just One of the Guys""."
3,"Nothing great, but popcorn for the bored","This is not the greatest film ever made, but when you want to see something light and fluffy, it works."
2,Worked Great For 8 Months,Stopped running after 8 months. Changed battery...twice. Still dead. This would be an outstanding watch if it had a reliable movement. Kept great time until it died. The tritium illumination works well. It's easy to read in any light. The case and crystal are rugged and the band is very comfortable. I am pleased with everything about this watch except the movement. I do not have enough confidence in the movement of these watches to buy another one.
4,Good Dive Watch!,"I needed a rugged dive watch and assumed that a watch with Navy Seals on it would be the best. It IS a good watch. The tritium is bright, making it easy to read in low light situations. I opted to install the velcro band and I must say this: I was disappointed in the flimsy pins that mount the rubber case of the watch to the band. I thought a SEAL watch would be more rugged, even down to the mounting to the band. The pins are standard, skinny, flimsy, watch pins found on any watch.Other than this complaint, the watch is recommended."
5,Luminox Always Visible,"No problems with delivery.The watch has exceeded my expectations.If you need to find the time in the wee hours of the morning, this watch is for you.Readable at 4:13Am, a good thing.Keeps excellent time and looks incredible.Buy one.Now.Indiglo is so yesterday . . .~m"
4,It's a gas!,"Nice watch at a good price compared to the same watch on other sites... The gas filled markers are very bright at night and don't diminish with time.As with most quartz watches, it keeps perfect time.The plastic case seems a bit cheesy, but overall well worth the money."
4,Good basic diving watch,No frills and easy to read. So far it has kept good time and after 16 dives still looks like new. The chemical lights are as bright as advertised and cannot think of anything wrong with it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a hard working watch
2,Not a good value,"Although I didn't purchase this product through Amazon, I feel compelled to inform consumers of my experience with it.Had this watch about a year and a half and it just stopped dead. Got it running again thinking it was the battery, but no luck. For no reason, just stopped running consistently. I admit I purchased it for the nylon band and the luminous features, which was great. Never had a watch that was as clear as this one in the dark. But less than a year after purchasing it, the band started to get ratty. You'd figure the way this watch is priced, would have gotten more use out of it and also a higher quality band. Even though it is not the same type of watch, I recommend Skagen as they hold up, are very attractive watches at a very affordable price."
4,Impressive beginning,"I just finished reading the third in the Trilogy and it's a great book. I won't reiterate the comments of other reviewers of Monkey Trap, but I did want to say that this book is a supremely necessary first step before taking on the other novels. I liked it very much. It is easy to see, in retrospect, how the writing matures with each succeeding book. Do not be dismayed. You WILL like this very different novel and now that the trilogy is complete, you WILL want to move immediately to the next. It is unlikely that you will be able to stop yourself."
5,Entertaining and captivating on many levels,"I've been an avid reader for over fifty years, and this is one of my favorite books. The character development is amazing, even in the relatively minor characters. The weaving together of action adventure, quantum physics, and spiritualism is seamless and compelling. I love this book!"
1,Not Worth Paper It's Printed On!,Artwork in book is poorly xerox copies.There are no photos or good illustrationsto bring the ideas to life. single sidedprinted book - waste of resources. Nonew info that can't be gleaned from internetfor free.
5,Overall better than other Compound W products,"I have used the strips, and the liquid Compound W wart remover, but the gel form is overall better. The gel can be applied precisely, and it stays on longer compared to the strips or liquid (bottle with brush). I wish I would've purchased the gel from the beginning.If you are embarrassed by you're warts, just apply the gel, let it dry, and then cover it up with a bandage."
2,Didn't work for my stubborn Wart,Not much else to say. I have a stubborn wart and this product just didn't go deep enough. I'm about to try a different product.
2,Difficult to get out of the bottle,"It performed as expected, but I had to keep it right near a safety pin because even though I religiously closed the cap every time, when it first arrived and every day I would open it, the goo inside would harden in the opening and form a plug that you have to poke out, and sometimes it is seriously hard to wrangle it out of the bottle. The plug was so hard to remove that I couldn't do it just by squeezing really really hard... not that you should do that anyway since it might explode everywhere if it does work... but still I couldn't even do it that way when I tried foolishly. The product works, but way too much of a hassle to deal with getting it out so it can get to work."
5,This really does work!,"After almost a year of unsuccessfully removing a nearly inch-wide wart on my foot through cyrotreatment, I finally decided to try salicylic acid as a ""last"" resort before surgery. After an entire tube of this product, I am happy to report that my wart is completely gone with nearly no trace of it ever being there! I am therefore extremely pleased and am giving this product my highest recommendation."
1,Crap!!! Not Work! Loose your money! Beware !,This Product is garbage! You need to use 2 or 3 tubes for take out one and honestly is very unefective product!
5,AMAZING PAINLESS and great control,"works works works!!!!! i didn't try any other wart removers since this one had such amazing reviews. My wart has been on my leg for over 15 years, it never really bothered me but i thought i should give this a try. Within the first two days i saw a difference!! When you put it on you definitely get a WHITE crust on top of where you put the gel, so i would put a band-aid on it. It works better if you take the white crust off the wart and put the gel on skin, but sometimes that's really hard to do. The ONLY SMALL ""problem"" is that the white crust sometimes would get caught on something and get yanked off causing it to rip and bleed. obviously it the gel STUNG the wounded skin. But other than that, THIS PRODUCT WORKSSS. I removed the wart on my leg in less than two weeks, and this was me NOT using the gel consistently."
2,Didn't do the trick,"I wish it worked, but so far (6 weeks in) no luck. And I have to say this stuff can not be good for your skin."
5,wow,"I happened upon this video at a thrift store and bought it. I had never seen a Richard Simmons workout before but was always curious. This video was fun to work out to and extremely fun to watch, especially with the good looking male dancers. I have since purchased several other of Richards videos and love them all. This one will always be my favorite. And I was glad to purchase it here in DVD form after using the thrift store VHS so much."
2,latin simmons,"I love my richard simmons and have 4 other DVD's however, the Latin Simmons left me a little sad. Richard didn't seem to give a lot of instruction and at some points in the workout seemed like he was lost. I also would have liked it too be longer. now don't get me wrong it's a nice workout however, it is not up to par with his other DVD's. if you just want something fun to do then this would be a CD for you but, if you really want to work out I would pass this 1 up."
5,This IS exercise...the Best Kind!,"I want to address a rather negative review that accused this of not being an exercise workout...I lost 40 pounds and 5 dress sizes dancing to this thing...matter of fact I was afraid of something happening to my old VHS and wanted a DVD to make sure I never lost it...the moves are fluid and fun, and they are teachable...each set of the workout deals with a different area of the body in specific motions...so much fun you do not realize you are ""exercising"", which is precisely why I love it. The dance sequence works the traps and the humorous and for balance and flexibility...this is a GREAT little gem and will remain my fave. By the way, I am 62 now, and started dancing to this in my late 50's...so OLA!"
1,Latin Blast Off,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. I like Richard Simmons, but this was a dud. I was also very upset that because I opened it, I am not able to return it for a refund. This makes no sense, how are you suppose to know you like an exercise video if you do not open it and watch it. This is not a friendly rule to customers of Amzon."
1,It may be attractive but,"Do not expect that clasp to hold your bracelet in place. I bought a similar bracelet from this company and it didn't take long for it to disappear. Even if I find it, will I feel comfortable wearing it again?I suggest if you buy this item, wear it for short periods to single events so you have some control over where it falls off."
5,First-rate kids' book,"David Isaac's The Leafy Sea Dragon is a richly told tale about the challenges of fitting in. His characters inspire children of all ages to step up to the task and persevere. The book is uniquely illustrated with lively colors. Although it's targeted to 5-10 year olds, I read it to my 3-year-old and he was captivated by the underwater adventures."
1,Greatest Heroes of the Bible: Joseph in Egypt,"Save your money. Buy used. I could not believe how short the movie is. Joseph is miscast,the scenery is lousy and it is over priced. This is the kind of movie that should be used as a bonus for x numbers of movies bought."
4,"""Joseph in Egypt"" (1978)","This is quite a good telling of the Biblical story of Joseph the Patriach, part of the late 1970's T.V. films the ""Greatest Heroes of the Bible"".There were a few minor flaws, such as the story spending too brief a time with Joseph serving in Potiphar's house, and then too long with his time in prison. And the final, all important reconciliation with his brothers is handled in just a few brief minutes. And of course the actors, being familiar T.V. figures of the time, are a bit hard to imagine in that ""far away and long ago"" story feeling.But, all in all, this is a reasonable account, and is worth viewing."
1,What a piece a junk,"The company is very bad to deal with. What a piece a junk. Do not buy the 9 Pc Security Type Torx Bit Set w/ Offset Wrench, Belt Clip it is junk & if you return the item they will charge you a storage fee for the junk they sold you."
4,Excellent Product for the price,This is an excellent product for the price. Very handy and compact enough to keep in toolbox or pocket.
2,"Pretty, But Out of Date","This map is pretty, but it is out of date. Still has Serbia and Montenegro as one country (they separated in 2006), and Myanmar listed as Burma (debatable, since the US doesn't recognize the name change), etc. If accuracy is important to you I wouldn't get this one."
5,Banjo B & B,I Have recently bought 3 DVD Banjo Tutorials and this has for me to be the best. Easy to follow and good Pdf Tab files as help. Very pleased with this one!
5,Timeless...,"I've read it again and again! I would recommend it for girls of all ages and princesses at heart. Follow Elstrid as she grows to be a woman, a leader, a warrior, a wife, and a queen to all who cross her path!"
2,Not her best fare,"Definitely not her best work but an easy read. I wish she'd get back to her chrestomanci/fire & hemlock books, don't you?"
3,"Decent, but not one of her best","Diana Wynne Jones remains one of my favorite authors, even though I think I'm about 20 years older than her usual target demographic. However, this book struck me as geared to an older audience (more romance and complicated relationships & emotions than some of her other books, in addition to at least one graphically grotesque bit), and while I'd congratulate her for trying to push her artistic boundaries, A Sudden Wild Magic ended up not one being of her best books.The plotline is pretty reasonably decent, though overly complex at points. The extra complexity kept me from being absorbed into the environment of the book, which is one of her true talents (readers of the Chrestomanci quartet or the Howl's line will know what I mean).All in all, ASWM is not a bad read (it really finds its footing 2/3 of the way into the book), but I'd say there are other books out there that better highlight her true storytelling genius."
3,Did I Read The Right Book?,"This book started out great, but once the story evolved into the House Committee on Un-American Activities hearings in Washington,DC it became too too detailed. Did they really need to write so many chapters about it? I don't deny it was a very important issue during that time, but the information was a bit excessive. It took me at least 3 weeks to finally finish this book and other than that chapter, it really is a good story about one of the best actors Hollywood ever produced."
5,great read,"This book is lengthy, but rarely boring. It's a fantastic resource if you want to learn about this unique film actor. It covers his entire personal life and career. A very good read."
4,"Informative, enthalling, and oh so human",I have read alot of movie star bio's. This one is one of the best. The writing is top-notch explaining the times as well as the man that was 'Bogart'. A massive amount of material never bores as the author's explain and in someways dissect Bogie. I couldn't recommend it more...
4,Recycled,"Made in GER in 2003, Serial# 511307-2, Playing time 122:51This 2CD compilation consists of the following:- 1 track from Ted Nugent's ""Free-For-All"" album;- all tracks from ""Bat Out Of Hell"", except for ""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad"";- all tracks from ""Dead Ringer"", except for ""Nocturnal Pleasure"";- all tracks from ""Midnight At The Lost And Found""So it's like 3 albums on 2 discs, with tracks shuffled around to avoid continuity; there's enough room left to have included the missing 2 songs!No lyrics, liner notes, or pictures; basic packaging and 2 hours of music from Meat Loaf's first 3 solo albums (the Epic years).So, it's an affordable way to get the ""bulk"" of the early stuff."
5,At First I Wasn't Too Sure About This One But...,"This turned out to be one of this author's best books. After reading the first few pages however, I had put it down due to tedium, but I decided to give it another try. I'm SO glad I did. Marcus is second only to Addis (BY POSSESSION) as far as sexy, sensitive, handsome heros go. And the plot was good; telling much about Marcus's feelings for Nesta in the way that he handled her 'treasonous' actions. Just a great story with great characters. David (BY ARRANGEMENT) was a delight, as was Addis, however brief his appearance."
3,HAs its Moments,"I really didn't love the book. I had trouble getting into the plot. Maybe because I had a lot of things going on at the same time. Anyway, it was ok. I liked the ending and there were moments in the book that were good."
2,Not that interesting,"This book meandered around. I could barely get through it but did only because I've enjoyed some of Hunters other books. I was not invested in either of the main characters unfortunately. I wasn't awed by how they made out the moment they met in the garden. I still don't get the heroines connection to the king either, but really don't care what it was because it was uninteresting. After reading it I even forgot the heroes and heroine's name! And not a good sign especially when he was in By Design which I liked. Oh yeah, Mark...or Marcus if you will. The one bright spot was David from the Arrangement showing up, as well as Addis from By Possession. That was it for me so it gets an extra star for those two hunks."
5,Outstanding piece of history comes alive,"Not being a great expert on this subject, I read this book with great deal of relish and delight. By the time I was done with it, I think I finally realized the extend of research and work done by Major Clunn in writing this book. There is a fictional scenairo written by Clunn which he describe the destruction of the three legions and in some parts, reduced it to a personal level. This too, I find quite interesting and pretty believable scenairo based on his research. Anyone who even got a slightest interest in Roman military history should be reading this book."
1,Good Archaeology,"Even though the search for the battle site is somewhat disjointed, I enjoyed the narrative, how a long, long mystery was solved.I am sure that the Germans enjoyed it too, they were enamored of Arminius since Tacitus was published in Germany in 16th century (for all the importance of this battle, there was no 'folk memory of it).I would point out several things in the fictional narrative. We do not know what Arminius' German name was. Herman is a 16th century and later construct. Greeks and Romans did not use slaves at the oars of their ships, no matter what you could see in 'Ben Hur'. The oarsmen were hired and paid, and dismissed after finishing voyage.Theft was considered a civil matter, so the trial of the two German tribesmen is VERY fictional.Setting aside the fiction, I recommend it for archaeologists!"
5,Extremely pleased,"I received these beautiful wooden stumps as ordered, but one of the small bails was broken. I was mortified because this was to be a birthday present and I only had a few days left. I immediately emailed sportzcommunity via amazon and received a same day response that they would send a replacement. They did, they were fast and they were super obliging and helpful. I guess customer service really isn't dead.Thank you."
4,"Sturdy, but gets dirty","This is a nice, sturdy yoga strap. My only complaint is that the light color gets dirty. Everything else is 5 stars."
5,"Simple, functional",I purchased this product for its eco-friendly properties and I'm happy to say (unlike the eco-friendly stereotype) it has held up to my yoga practice and enhanced it. It's comfortable and easy to clean making this a great product for any yogi.
5,Thin - but great as a travel strap,I wouldn't use this as an everyday studio strap (material and metal clasp are real thin) but this is a nice light-weight one for travel or to keep in your yoga bag or car.
5,Very good for struggling in Real Analysis,"There is no problem solutions for Real Analysis texts available in U.S. since most of the teachers believe that Math students in grad level should be more creative. However, not all students in Real Analysis are potential mathmatician. If they lost in class and must study by theirselves, they may feel frustrated missing all the stuff contained in problems. The material in ""Principles of Real Analysis"" may not superior much than other famous text(like Royden, I think Royden is clear enough but too much mysterious things lie in problems.). But use it with this workbook, you will find much comfortable in self study. It helps a lot not only in my homework assignment, but also in my understanding."
5,A's baseball fans rejoice!,This is the absolute perfect gift for the A's fan that has everything! I can never think of anything else to get for my dad and he LOVED this!
2,Baseball,My problem with buying this dvd is the advertising. I thought that kind of thing was not put on a purchased item like dvds/
5,"MLB Vintage World Series Films - Oakland A's 1972, 1973, 1974 & 1989",This was an excellent video. I've been a fan of the A's since they arrived from Kansas City. It was great watching all the legendary player together again. It didn't get any better than that.
2,A's world series,Very disappointed. i wanted and expected the full 1973 World Series. Not impressed that it's just highlights.
1,Shocked as to how blatantly it ripped off other movies!,"Talk about lack of imagination. Sure a script, storyline could be influenced by others, but,""There goes my Baby"" was shameless in it's repeated rip-offs of entire chunks of story from the movie ""Hollywood Knights"".This might even be forgivable, but the use of complete lines of dialogue as well from the same flick really dissapointed me! There were notable acting moments, the fact that several of the actors went on and still are notables, makes it apparent that the weakness here was the lack of a real screenplay or solid storyline! I also expect authenticity, & the lack of any ""Musclecars"" mixed into the continuous parade of hot rods & custom (lead-sleds) did not convey realism! You'd think that some of the hottest (& best selling) cars ever produced,I.E. GTO's,Chevelles, 442""s,409 Impalas would have been hitting the cruise spots profiled in this film??"
2,A Disappointment,"Although there's a lot going on here, the wide sprawl of characters and situations not fully developed makes for a film that doesn't add up to much. The cast is very attractive but the script lets them down. It's no wonder this film sat on the shelf for over two years before being released A real let down."
4,"OK, entertaining and thought-provoking.","This is worth watching. I gave it 4 stars, but wasn't sure if 3 would have been better. But there are good contrasts between affluent and non, white and black, ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" views, plus a little gratuitous bare chests from several of these well-known male actors. It reminds me of American Graffiti also, go figure."
1,Don't bother,"As a single mother and an educator, I purchased this title for my son and the AMA's guide for myself. Don't bother with Puberty Boy. Although presented in a visually fun format, and containing some excellent information, my son felt this was a ""cheesy"" book, and lacked the serious tone necessary for him to believe he was getting solid information. He and I both much prefer the AMA's guide."
2,The Lowrider Handbook,Decent book but I was expecting more in depth and more than a small collection of tech articles from Lowrider Magazine. It wasn't very well organized either. I would recommend purchasing one used rather than spend the money on a new one if you have to have this book.
4,Bonus DVD scenes are available,"To anyone who wasn't able to access the bonus scenes from the web site- what you need to do is search the event (UFC 104 and UFC 105), then find the bonus DVD scenes. Add them to your cart, then enter the codes that came with it. While it didn't give me the option to download them, I at least could watch them."
4,I like this book.,This text was what I needed for my bible studies. The text format was in a descent size and a good amount of information is provided in the text. The include CD would be better on DVD. I think it would greatly improve the performance.
1,The Ezzarath Metaphysical and Biblical Encyclopedia,"This book is an excellent reference guide to any question one would have about the afterlife, signs, symbols metaphysically and biblically. I found it helpful with reading other Ezzrath's books into giving better insight to as what I was reading, making It is very easy to read and understand. I recommend also reading her other book ""Ultimate Deciet of the Human Race: The Ezzrath Theory."""
4,Gets boring quickly,"Fun game, but only for about a week or month depending on how often you play. Probably much better if you have others to play against."
3,Fun game.,This game is fun just like the first one was. I didnt get a chance to play the second one but the super hard hit thing they have added to it sucks. really dont like it at all. kinda takes away from it for me. fun game though. the weigh in brawls were a good idea.
3,Nice but has a flaw,Comes packaged in original case along with instruction booklet which I was glad to see. Also arrived a bit earlier than expected which was great. The loading time for this game can be painfully frustrating. I went out to the kitchen to get a glass of water. Came back and it was still processing. But for a game well below 10 bucks I suppose it's not so bad.
1,Crap!!!!,"Absolutely the most disappointing game I have ever bought. The game is totally sluggish, response is slow, and the pick of fighters is horrible, Floyd Patterson? Who is Brock? Dropped is Marciano, of the top 10 heavy weights of all time only Ali is present, ( no Joe Frazier is not top 10) wish I could get my money back."
1,Sucked!,The graphics pretty much suck and the game is fake. You seriously can't knock out Mohamid Ali in a fight. I hated it.
2,S-L-O-O-O-O-OW,"This game is terrible! I LOVED the first Fight Night,I never played Round 2 but I bought this game the day it came out. The gameplay is so sloooow! I feel like my boxer is throwing punches underwater!! This game sucks so much I tried to get my money back already."
1,Should have played it first!,"I was a big fan of EA's Knockout Kings games in the late 90's early 2000's and I was so looking forward to this game that I bought it without trying it first , bad idea!Pro'sGraphicsConsakward controlsSlow reaction time of fighters you controlI have heard FN 1 and 2 are better versions. Maybe stick with those?"
1,Online play doesn't work; EA shut down the server,I bought this game so I could play on-line. But apparently EA shut down the server for Round 3. Bummer.
4,For the size works well,I bought a complete HK sound system for my house and it had a set of these speakers. They sounded pretty good for their size. I have a condo in a large city that has limited space so I found a set of these on Amazon.com to go with my old stereo I use in that condo. They are not the best sounding speakers in the world but have respectable sound and look good. Their size is small and they fit almost anywhere.
4,A little smaller than the HKTS 18 5.1 set,"I bought these speakers to make my HKTS 18 system into a 7.1 system. Great quality sound and the speakers look like the 5.1 set, but the speakers are a little bit shorter."
4,BEWARE - CANNOT NETWORK THROUGH PRINT SERVER,"Canon MultiPass F80 met all of my expectations EXCEPT one. It cannot be DIRECTLY connected to a network through a PRINT SERVER. This is NOT a Post Script printer and therefore, would not interface with either Linksys or Hawking print servers. Spent many hours on the phone will technical support of Linksys, Hawking, and Canon who ALL said to give up trying. In fact, Canon said this machine is NOT designed to be networked and that is their ""official position.""The only way I could Network the Canon F80 was to connect it directly to a shared PC on my network with a USB cable (NOT supplied by Canon, by the way.) As long as this shared PC is powered ON, the Canon MultiPass F80 can be accessed by my other PC's and wireless Think Pads on the network."
4,value for money,"have had this printer for over 6 months now.use it for scanning, faxing, copying and of course printing.It works very well.. color images come out pretty sharpand neat, with great resolution.another great thing is that even if you run out of ink inone tank, it will still continue to print (albeit theprintouts will be without that color !)."
2,Canon Multipass F80 Support Sucks,"The software/driver for this printer will not work properly with Windows XP, SP2. It causes computer freeze, requiring a reboot, in which data will be lost when trying to print from many applications. It also adversely affect the address drop downs in your internet browser. Canon offers a bandaid fix, but the issue has been known since the release of SP2 and Canon has not and will not fix this issue. I have finally given up on Canon and will move on to a different brand printer. Beware!"
4,great but not perfect,"All in all I am very happy with this copier and find it to be light years ahead of the HP stuff (which I previously owned for a year). My main complaint is the LCD display which is *way* too dim to read with little constrast and no back lighting (as in, get out the flashlight). Other than that its great and I would highly recommend it."
4,The LCD is too small,"I think this is really a good printer, I tried to copy, to scan and to print of course ( I don't tried to fax yet).All is perfect.Except one thing: the LCD is too small !And in addition, for read what is write on the LCD, you must put your eyes in a specific position...So i put only 4 stars because it's a very good printer but the LCD is not perfect."
2,Canon ink smears if touched with moist hands,I bought this printer was pretty happy until I found out if there is little moist on your hand ink smears on pictures printed on quality glossy photo paper.I called Canon customer services they said it is normal.I tested my epson printed pictures with wet finger ink did not smeared.It looks it is generic Canon ink problem.
1,no parts,"I have a f80 canon that's about 14 months old and the printhead started running the colors together. Went to Staples where i got the printed and the printhead they have that is supose to fit all E- tanks won't fit the f80. They called the Canon company and was told they don't put this product on the shelf,has to be special order and hope it fits. Not a very good product if they don't make parts for it that you can get from the dealers."
3,Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest,"Okay. So we have Roxette's collection of their greatest hits. Don't expect these ""hits"" all to hit you in a good way.The noteworthy tracks off this CD were ""One Wish,"" the sunny ""The Look,"" the optimistic ""Dressed for Success,"" the upbeat ""Dangerous,"" ""It Must Have Been Love,"" the driving ""Joyride,"" and ""Spending my Time with You."" Others I didn't care so much about. 7/20 of the album!I don't know much about this duo. I chose them out of a music catalog because I heard one of their songs before. That's just how I felt about the majority of this music: bored and impatient. I didn't like most of the rhythms."
5,Better than I thought,"I wanted to buy something that I would like to listen when I'm not alone in my car. Well, those 20 Greatest songs work. When I'm alone driving, I usually listen to Slayer, Sepultura, Sodom..... but with my wife, well... you know.... the first time that I played this cd with ""company"" in my car, I saw everyone following the music with their head, hands and legs, so I though ""Perfect"". If you want some easy-listening music, this cd is the chosen one...."
1,The Nude Bomb,This was a terrible movie. It revises the character of Maxwell Smart (Don Adams). Smart & his team of crime fighters do battle against an enemy with a bomb that could leave the world nude. The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful women. Don't waste your time or money on this film.
2,UNMEMORABLE (IT'S BEST POINT),"What the movie MISSION IMPOSSIBLE did for the TV series of the same name, THE NUDE BOMB does for (to) the TV series Get Smart. This film is absolutely irrepentable! It is actually saddening to watch this ""sequel"" to the TV series GET SMART. In it, the evil empire prepares to detonate a bomb that shall destroy all fabric (clothing). Hence, THE NUDE BOMB. That way the bad guys, whose clothes must be bomb-gaurded, can blackmail everyone lest they stay nude forever. Only the re-enactments of the crazy spy equipment from the TV series, and brief cameos from original cast members, offer a nominal enthusiasm for this petty disheartening tripe. No wonder 99 stayed home!"
1,Not Quite Smart,"Do yourself a favor. If you are familiar with the 1960's spy spoof ""Get Smart"", keep your happy memories of that show intact and skip this movie. Some of the same creative minds that were behind that show were involved with this movie, but not many of them. The catchphrases are still here, but the effort is hollow. Agent 99 is not in this one, nor is she mentioned at all. Max is shown as a playboy who grins at his new female sidekick. Most of the jokes you can see coming from miles away, and when they arrive, they're still not funny."
1,A Disaster of a film from the Second Master of Disaster,"I remember watching it once a long time ago, but don't remember much of it except being disappointed. Now reading everyone else's reviews, I now remember why. One piece of information not mentioned is that according to a filmography list (since I haven't seen it recently, so I don't know if it's accurate) the producer is Jennings Lang, the producer of what I think are great disaster films of the 1970s (Earthquake, Airport 1975, Airport '77, Rollercoaster, and The Concorde -- Airport '79). He produced a few more movies in the early '80s and then seemed to retire until his death in early 1996. But for him to be the producer of THIS film is VERY disappointing, but then I guess everyone can't have a perfect record."
2,"Wow, just not that good - but if you're a completist, get it.","This is NOT really a sequel to the original Get Smart! TV show; It has Maxwell Smart, and he's a spy, and... that's about it. No 99, No CONTROL, no Hymie, no KAOS, basically nothing from the original. And it's not that funny. BUT, there is a couple of chuckles here and there and it is an opportunity to see Don Adams in character once more. If you are a completist, get it. If you REALLY liked the original, buy the season sets from Time-Life or pick up the Get Smart Again! TV-movie on DVD (MUCH closer to the original - Sigfried, Hymie and 99 are all back)."
4,"would you believe, really funny?","Despite the naysayers, enough hysterical one-liners and bits of business make this worthwhile. OK, so 99 and others are missing from the cast but this has much better pacing than ""The Return of Maxwell Smart"", the TV movie. Nice backlot tour of Universal studios too. A generous amount of memorable, quotable lines, i.e.; ""You haven't been the same since that accident when you lost your leg, your eye, your arm, your larynx. Whats WRONG with you"""
2,NOT The Return of Maxwell Smart,"I don't know who Don Adams was playing in this movie. It sure wasn't Maxwell Smart..more like Austin Powers. Would Max ever say stuff like, ""I thought our female agents were young and willing to fool around a lot."" None of the original writers or production stuff that created the brilliant original series were involved. Don Adams said that the funniest bits were stuff that was cut from the film. Very painful to watch...doesn't capture the feel of the original show at all. There was no humor whatsoever from the extremely dull KOAS actors. See Get Smart Again another time instead of this. That movie is much better and doesn't mention this movie, even in passing."
2,Missed it by THAT much...,"Actually released in the cinemas, this lackluster attempt to bring the character of Maxwell Smart to the big screen fails miserably. With none of the supporting cast from the television series to assist him, Don Adams does his best to get laughs with a sub par script.We do get some of the classic lines (""Sorry about that, Chief"") and various visual gags, but the lack of true comedy (and the unfortunately obvious painted on hair on Adams) takes away from what could have been glorious.Even the made-for-TV reunion movie ""Get Smart, Again"" was superior. That venture was a labor of love, and everyone there genuinely wanted to be there.In fact, skip THE NUDE BOMB completely, and just pick upGet Smart Again.You'll thank me for it later."
2,The Nude Bombed,"Although this wasn't a bad movie, it cannot compare to the TV series with 99 and Edward Platt as the chief."
2,Not that funny,"My wife remembered this being very funny when she first saw it in the 80's. So we looked all over for it--and were pretty disappointed. Agent 99 is missing, a lot of the jokes are super stale, and things seem just a bit slower and more predicatble than in the series."
1,misleading and not funny.,"Yes, what I learned about this flick was how to do misleading and it cost me another 10 bucks. The main attraction for me was Silvia Kristel who appeared for about 30 seconds somewhere, well 30 seconds are 30 seconds, right? I am not sure what was the purpose producer had in mind--comedy, parody, to show his incompetence etc, in any case all actors look terribly not funny, all situations are artificial and women are interested in being females. Avoid."
5,Almost there...we just need Season 3 now!!!!,"The best season of one of the best TV series ever made is finally coming to DVD. Its hard to say whether Season 2 or 3 is better, but Season 2 scrapes by as bit better. I can't express my jubilation at the release of this series on DVD. I love this show so much. Get this season, get all the seasons. The show will change your life, and the replay value of these episodes is infinite. This show is so good, despite its tragically short tenure on Comedy Central, that it is being made into a theatre-released MOVIE. Get very excited. Here are the episodes.-The Virgin Jerri-Behind Blank Eyes-Yes You Can't-The Goodbye Guy-The Blank Page-Hit and Run-To Love, Honor and Pretend-The Blank Stare (Part 1)-The Blank Stare (Part 2)-A Price Too High for RichesMy favorite episode is Hit and Run. Noblet and Jellineck are priceless in this one. This whole season is better than good, its gooder. ..."
2,"The first few shows were good, then into the comode.","The first 4 or 5 shows of the first season were good, but something went away after that. It never really got the edge back. And Amy Sedaris is a one track pony. And she gets old after a while. This just wasn't for me. I returned it."
5,5 Stars for Season Two - But Season One Deserved 6!,"Season Two is a glorious revelation from the Gods of Comedy and features such wiley moments (often musical) such as Noblett singing 80s power rock ballads and yellow-clad cult members of the Safe Trap House joyously chanting, ""I'm gonna sit at the Welcome Table, Hallelujah!"", but unfortunately Season Two is missing a bit of that life-altering je ne sais quoi of the first. Guy, Jerri's actively catatonic father, is dead by episode three to be replaced by a weakened rendition of the old favorite, Stu, the Meat Guy. The sexual tension between Noblett and Jellineck has fizzled.Despite its faults, Season Two is gem of hilarity. I give it five stars, but I still think that Season One deserved six!"
1,left wanting,"I absolutely loved these earrings when I saw them. They were perfect for a friend of mine for Christmas, so I ordered them. As of right now they have not been delivered, I have not heard back from the seller after countless attempts, and now Amazon wants me to review them. Well here it is:I was told they would be here between Dec. 16 - 30th, It is now January 11th, still nothing. I was charged for them and they were supposedly shipped but they never arrived. I am livid. Do not purchase anything from this person, they will fall through."
4,In Depth Study,"I liked this book because it detailed a lot of information concerning the Black Liberation Movement. It is really techical and in-depth in the sense that you can't just breeze through the pages. So, if you have time to not only read but also breakdown the elements of this book then I would definitely recommend it for you."
3,no leather insole.,This sneaker does not have the leather insole that NATURINO ordinarily has. I was disappointed.
3,"Interesting, but not essential","In my mind, there are two kinds of Gurps books. Those with new rules and new systems to handle new situations, and those that just provide background information for a certain genre. Aztecs is a book of the second kind.I have to say that I am biased heavily towards the first kind of book. If you study up on Aztecs, you could run an Aztec campaign just fine without owning this book, and if you don't know a fair amount about Aztecs then it doesn't seem to likely that you are going to be trying to build a campaign around them.Like most GURPS books, it is well written and well researched. If you like to read GURPS books for inspiration, and to learn things, you will probably like this book."
3,My cat loves it but be warned,"I switched my cat to the Reduced Calorie dry cat food because I don't like the idea of him eating animal by-products. When I was still mixing his old food with this food, he actually picked out this stuff and left his old food in the bowl. HOWEVER, I noticed that his poop REEKS--I live in a small apartment and he stinks up the entire place. Although he loves the stuff, I think I'm going to be forced to switch to a new food because of the smell."
1,The worse item I bought from amazon,"Folks this is not even worth a $1.00 so please don't waste your time, the moment I got this it looked used and worn out, I was so vex it don't make sense to send it back it would have cost to much money!"
5,As fun to play as Ring King,"Years ago Ring King was the best two player boxing game around. Now with Knockout Kings 2001 you can have all the gameplay of Ring King with awesome graphics and real life boxers. It's almost like your controling real people in the ring. EASPORTS did a great job with the motion capture, the boxers move like their real world counterparts. I also like the fact that the real boxers have personalities similar to those they've demonstrated in the ring. The ""real time"" commentary is great, although it can screw up from time to time. The game takes a little getting used to, but after an hour or two you should be familar with the controls and the timing. I would recommend this game anyone."
3,Fun but Slow,"This is a game that is packed with a wealth of fighters, from Ali to De La Hoya. The fighting scenes are good and very smooth. The degree of difficulty, however, is not very challenging. The game play is extremely slow due to the frequent and absurd amount of loading time it required. Overall, its a better than average game that needs a little more work."
1,LOAD TIME ...!!,The Load time on this game ALL through the game is HORRENDOUS and COMPLETELY KILLS any redeeeming factor in this game. DONT EVEN RENT THIS ... of a GAME!graphics ... game is too short. career mode is limited. LOAD TIME is the WORST and LONGEST LOAD of any game out there. EA really released a DOG in this one. Ultimate Fighting for Dreamcast is 100 times better than this junk ...
2,Is This PS1or PS2,"This game sucks the graphics are the exact same as the regular Playststion. If I had known the graphics were so poor there would've been no way that I would've purchased KOK. I was terribly disappointed dont get me wrong if you have no tatse for good graphics you will proably enjoy this game, but I expected better graphics out of the PS2. I didn't upgrade from a PS1 to a PS2 spending over 300 bucks for the same graphics as PS1. If Sony keeps this up they will definetly be sorry when the X-Box comes out!"
2,Very Good Graphics & Gameplay But Too much Loading Time,"This game is visually and responsively pretty good, the graphics and gameplay are very good. However the major drawback of this game is all the loading time. It loads before the game, after the introductions, between rounds and after the fight when the decision is made. The Boxers come to the ring with no enterage and no robe. When you knock out someone in real life the ref doesn't take both boxers to the center of the ring for the decision (do the people who design these games even watch boxing??). Also you can't fight created boxers in exibition mode or against eachother. One last thing, the damage to your opponents is very limited. You can hardly see the cuts, there is no drippings of blood and very little swelling of the eyes or face. Overall the game is pretty disappointing, especially with the supposed enhancements of PS2. (Rent before you buy!!!!)"
4,Overall a good game i would recommend that u buy the game,Almost everything about this game is perfect but in career mode when creating ur guy u should be able to have more adavanced commands for the looks and u should be able to go as many fights as u want not only 22 fights. The gameplay is AWESOME in this game it is hard and just like fights in real life. The graphics are pretty good but they could be better. I think this is the BEST boxing game made for any system which i own all of them. I highly recommend that u buy this game right now u will love it.
2,"I am a fan of Knockout Kings, but......","Graphically awesome. ""Dynamic Punch Control"" and multi-style boxers allow for infinite ""in the ring"" possiblities. However, out of the ring, the game goes nowhere. The training sessions are good, yet the same linear ""climb the ranks"" approach is getting old. Also, the ""create a boxer"" options are limited (i.e..limited shorts, gloves, tatoos). The big disapointment is that you can NOT fight created boxers against each other! Even KK99 had that option. It is my opinion that EA Sports held back on the out of the ring options. KK01 for the PSX has more options (i.e..aging, clothing). I would suggest sacrificing graphics for more game options and buying the cheaper version for the PS1. The PS2 version looks great but, unfortunetly, that is all. I think Knockout Kings is the best boxing games you can buy, however, it is nowhere near the level it should be."
2,SLOW,"Thisis disappointing. It seems slow and sluggish, especially when compared to Ready2Rumble. Plus, it has to hit th disc for an annoyingly long time to see the between rounds movies/scenes. Because of this, it is difficult to get into any kind of flow.It is a fairly realistic game requiring you to work jabs, etc. in order to set up big punches. But overall, I'm glad I only rented it instead of dropped ... on it.And the graphics are pretty lame too..."
1,Don't waste your money,I've had this game for four hours...and that's 3 hours 50 minutes too long. I'm taking it back tomorrow. It's just a bunch of random button mashing. Combos don't really work or seem to make a difference. The graphics are pretty pathetic...the boxers heads are always pointed towards the screen...I guess the developers were proud of the faces. \
2,I can't give this game a great rating,"It is a good game overall, however, if you want a good creat of boxer this is not what you want. I for one WOULD like to have a decent creat a boxer. this one doesn't even beat The Greatest Heavywieght's creat a boxer. They had to scan in people which to me was a total bad idea.I hope EA Sports makes 4 Major improvements on 2002 version.1.ALOT BETTER Creat of Boxer! maby a creat of manager/trainer/cut man. 2.Creat Female Boxers. 3.LARGER line up! 40 All Star Boxers my ...! Get back to the basics and allow a 30 rank Heavywieght league maby 34 so 4 other people can be on at the same time, and if they wanna pass you there gonna have to beat yah. and 4. ALLOW defending the championship belt!These are what keep Knockout Kings from becoming the greatest Boxing game ever."
5,I STILL read this book at 34 years old!,"The trilogy of Amy and Laura books were my absolute favorite when I was a kid. I read and reread them until my copies were destroyed and falling apart. Whenever I want to revisit my childhood and escape into a simpler and better time, I pull out my copies I have bought as an adult and read them again. I can not explain why these books created such an impression but you just have to read them to know. I recommend all mothers of pre-teen girls to go out and buy these wonderful books that are back in print."
5,A Great book! A must have for ALL Girls!,"My mom got me this book a few years ago, and no matter how many times I read it, I still love it!! Its about the sisters Laura and Amy and their first year at a summer camp. At first Laura hates it, but as soon as she makes a new friend, Anna, things start looking up! There are a few suprises in store for the reader, but I'm not gonna tell, read this book for yourself and find out!"
5,My Favorite,"This book meant so much to me when I was young. I, too, was a bookworm and I identified so strongly with Laura. This book helped me feel better and more accepting of myself. I enjoyed it over and over, and remember it vividly. Here I am, forty years later, looking for a copy!"
2,not the best way to learn mandoin,The DVD arrived fine and all. but the pictur quality was low and it was very difficult to navigate. I addition you have to look around for practice pages and then you have to print them out to use then and the print quality was poor. For about the same price I got a Mel Bay book through my local shop and it came with a far superior DVD. Since it is a book I don't have to print anything.
2,I prefer group mandolin lessons,I bought this DVD and a mandolin chord book. The DVD I watched once then I signed up for a 7 week group beginner's mandolin lesson. The 10 person lesson for the 75.00 90min weekly far exceeds anything I could ever learn on a silly DVD. BUT... if you live in a rural area or an area that doesn't have or appreciate fantastic beautiful instruments like the mandolin-I guess the DVD may be you only exposure. You may want to buy it here or used or check you local library.
5,Miracle's Boys,"The book arrived in the time frame expected and was in great condition. I love this movie, it was used in conjunction with the book. Helped students understand the book better and make comparisons of the two."
3,It will help BOTH SISTERS AND BRO.,"whom in hardship to understand that even they can make it , no matter what. They were going thru a hard situtation w/o mom and dad plus bro in jail....the bro in charge didn't know how to get bro back to be happy. If they got thru that, we can do it too with the Lord's help! Amen..."
5,onslaught - welcome back,"i have waited along time to see 1 of my favourite bands of all time to come back. When i found out in early 2007 that onslaught were back i was hoping the album would be as good as the force. to my surprise killing peace has excelled the force into a better more rounded album. Live Polish Assault the dvd is a killer of a dvd. Great to see the boys live on a stage as its not easy for me to see them these days. the dvd itself has the polish live show, some japanese live footage and my personal favourite some live audio from bristol colston hall. I saw onslaught back in the 80's in bristol many times and they were always thankfull to there fans. Well heres 1 fan who n o longer lives england but lives in usa thanking onslaught for bringing out such a quality live dvd and hears looking at the future."
5,Coleman quality shines through!,"Just got through test lit'n my new exponet lantern.Like most everything I've got from Amaz.com It came quicker than expected,worked right out of the box and fits well inside my pack.On many previous trips I tied one of those old 2 mantle camp lanterns on the outside of my pack.Never again Thanks Coleman&Amazon"
4,cute and Tiny,"This is a tiny lantern that gives a whole lot of light.It uses coleman mantle number 20 which is slightly smaller then the number 21.The valve control is precise.the ventilator on this thing is not like other coleman lanterns that have a ball nut on the top ,instead the the handle has to be inserted into the ventilator and the into a hole in the lantern.It is kind of a hassle.The globe does not sit secured in place due to this mechanism.They should have provided a ball nut like the coleman 285 in which the globe sits tightly secured.the rest is fine.Lights very easily.easy to carry.requires very little space.the cap lanyard is a nice addition."
3,Amazon Shipped it Broken...TWICE,"I wish I could review this product, I was eagerly looking forward to trying it out. But TWICE now morons in Amazon Shipping sent it packed improperly and the glass was shattered upon arrival. TWICE now! Each time it was packed against the side of the shipping box with only a few bubble pouches on the other side...not a very good way to ship something that's fragile.At this stage I have sent the second one back for a refund. Amazon seems to have the best price on it, but what good is that if they keep shipping back the exchanged item broken again.Someone in Shipping needs to get their head out of their butt!!!"
4,If Ya Want A Tasty Sample...,"If ya want a very tasty sample of some of the best southern rockers from the past, this is the album to get. It'd be redundant to go through each artist and song; suffice that the Hotlanta Jam by Sea Level and 'friends' is a rate find and just about worth the price of admission. This gem is highly recommended."
4,No Way Out 2008,"ECW - CM Punk vs. Chavo - Averge Match okay but not the best(they need the original E-C-W back!)Smackdown chamber - in my opinion this was the worst chamber ever. but it was still pretty good they like never had more than 3 people in the chamber at one time. some cool spots like when MVP got chokeslamed of a podFlair vs. MR. KENNEDY! - oviusly fliars career isnt gonna be ended by mr. kennedy! okay matchedge vs. rey myestrio - okay match was short cause of rey's injurycena vs. orton - 2nd best match good match hate ending when orton low blows cena and gets DQed then cena getSTFU on him after the match-bad sportsmanship on cenas part = ] ORTON'S #1Raw chamber - by far best match of the night very, very, very good match and it was pretty bloodey pretty cool when eveyone did their finisher to umaga hardy did a swanton off a pod"
3,"If It Aint In Widescreen, Dont Buy It","Royal Rumble 2008, and WWE starts broadcasting in Widescreen. Royal Rumble 2008 DVD, released as Full Screen.... No Way Out 2008 DVD, released as Full Screen...WWE wont be getting any money from me in 2008 untill they start releasing their PPV DVDs in Widescreen. It seems a waste of time buying these DVD releases, when you know that there is a Widescreen version available on the internet in 720p already. Wrestlemania 24 is coming out on Blu-Ray I know that, but is the WWE just going to not worry about the other PPVs?"
3,Bad hare day,"When I first saw this book at the library the name and the cover of the book kind of looked silly so I got it. I wasn't expecting the book to be anything great and it wasn't. It wasn't really scary, but it was still worth reading. Anyways, this book is about a boy named Tim who loves magic. His favorite magician is Amazo and someday Tim wants to be a magician just like him. In the book Tim gets a ticket to go see an Amazo show, but it isn't until ten at night and his parents won't let him go. Tim really wanted to go see the show so he sneaks out at night with his sister to go see it. At the show Tim gets to talk to Amazo and he turns out to be mean, so Tim decides to steal his bag of magic tricks. This book isn't scary and nothing really that exciting happens until about the end of the book. Even though this book wasn't the best goosebumps in the series you should still definitely read it."
4,Magic tricks that go awry,"I read this ""fun scary"" book to my 7-year-old son and we both enjoyed it.It's the story of a 12-year-old boy who wants to be a magician so badly that he pushes things a little too far. It has some inventive twists and scary moments, and keeps you guessing right up to the end.We've read a lot of the Goosebumps series and while none of them can be considered groundbreaking literature, they're always good for entertainment."
2,It's ok.,"i have to admit it this book is not scary, nor cool but at some parts you want to see what happens. i thought this book was really cool because of the front cover, but i made a mistake. i think it is really stupid to tell you the truth. R.L Stine you must have made a big mistake when you wrote this book......."
1,It was the worst Goosebumps book I ever read.,R. L. Stine made this book terrible because he didn't express the characters' feelings. He should have thought of something better to write about. But most of his Goosebumps books are better
5,Great,"Tim Loves magics. When he meets Amaz-O in person, he cannot beleive it. One day, he stole the magic kit of Amaz-O. When her snotty sister takes a bite of the carrot, she turns into a rabbit. How will Tim make her sister go back to normal?"
1,Oh my God,"I have read every book in the first goosebumps series and this is so rubbish I couldn't be bothered to read all of it. My favorite goosebumps books Say Cheese and Die and Say Cheese and die again are 1'000,000 times better than this and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Probobly the most lame book Iever read It's not scarey, just because Tim Swanson's sister turns into a rabbit. Some people are totally freaked out buy this but take my word it is LAME!!! Face it R.L Stine you hit on Vampire breath but totally missed on your worst book ever Bad Hare Day!"
2,Not Scary,This book basically stinks. I'm older now but some goosebumps books were actually scary. He didn't put enough detail in this book to make it scary.Although this book is for little kids the way R.L. Stine wrote it was very juvenille. Why can't he come up with something gory?blood?guts? anything other than some snarling beast? He needs to put vicious murders in his stories even if them little guys be kids. More detail on the scary parts R.L.! Come up with something original please
5,READ IT!!!,"Such a cool book. What an achievement for R.L. Stine. It was such an interesting story!!! It didn't blabber about nothing it stuck to the story. Just go and read it. ""Baaaa."" Translated that means ""Cool!"""
3,This book was okay.,This book was not that good.It is because the goosebumps series of books are supposed to be scary and this one was not that scary.It was more of just a personal experience by Tim Swanson.It did not have any real sacry scenes in it.
3,A Magician Gone Mad...,"Tim Swanson loves magic. His hero, Amaz-o calls him a punk, so Tim takes his bag of magic tricks. But the tricks are mean and evil"
5,Magic tricks and a weird magician,"bad hare day is another one of my favorites. first, i liked all the different magic tricks, like the multiplying red balls and hissing snakes. The story is about Tim, a boy who wants to be a magician. When he sees Amaz-O, his most favorite magician, he gets trapped in a room after performing a dissapearing act. When he gets out, he steals Amaz-O's box of tricks, but he doesn't know what kind of tricks are in there! Youll have to read the book to see if Tim is really a good magician."
4,Sturdy but had issue right after getting it,"The stand is very sturdy and capable of holding full-sized weighted key, keyboards. However, soon after putting it together, the crossmember holding the top tier section broke at the screw that tightens it. I had to take out the finger screw and replace it with a longer bolt. Now I need a wrench to tighten it instead of using my thumb and finger like was intended. That's the only reason this stand doesn't get 5 stars from me."
3,"Decent, I wouldn't say heavy duty","Picked up this stand in December 2011 to replace a double keyboard stand that gave out on me. It gets the job done but I wouldn't say I'm thrilled about it. It comes as a disassembled single stand, and a separate additional tier that adds on. I didn't feel this was clearly noted for consumers.(If you have a single stand, save yourself the $ and just buy the upper tier attachment)The cross-support on the upper tier is only possible to attach with the arms completely vertical. This leaves too large of a gap for a Microkorg and other smaller synths.Also worth noting: one of my screws for the assembly was shorter than all the others, leaving one leg much weaker than the others. Overall, I would say I was much happier with my Proline stand than my On-Stage stand. Now we see if it stands the test of time"
3,sleeping beauty,"A 20th Century parallel to the legend of sleeping beauty -- doomed to imprisonment until the man who really loved her should waken her with a kiss. The heroine wears a nurse's uniform instead of a long dress, and the prince is a struggling doctor."
2,Food Catches on the Bottom of the Slicer Slot and Tears,"I bought this slicer primarily for meats. It works very well for that purpose. But when I started baking my own bread I began to use it to pre-slice the loaves for sandwiches and toast. Unfortunately the lip on the bottom of the slicer slot protrudes slightly, probably to ease the slice away from the machine. With bread, though, it causes it to catch in the opening between the blade and the back, and I have to readjust the thickness dial to the maximum in order to remove each slice. Often it tears the slice anyway. Not a particularly helpful feature. I'm not sure if another slicer would work better, but this one is really frustrating."
1,This is NOT dishwasher safe!,I just received my slicer which I selected after a lot of research because it is advertised here as being dishwasher safe. It is NOT dishwasher safe per the Use/Care guide (says it is hand wash only). I got upset and called American Harvest/Nesco directly and they confirmed IT IS NOT DISHWASHER SAFE! Someone needs to remove this false advertising!!!!
1,Trash,"The author was president of the UACC and was thrown out of the club for over 20 years for serious ethics violations. The book is poorly written and the author, fairly ignorant about autographs uses many machine signed signatures on the cover. This guy just doesn't know autographs.The author admits to signing a few autographs of someone in his book, he asks a few readers if they can guess which signatures he signed."
1,rehash of already published material,"I did the practice tests for IIS4.0 and there were almost the same as in the Exam Cram. The tests also did not prepare you to take the actual Microsoft exam. I would not recomend buying this book, if the other practice tests are anything like IIS. I returned my copy, so I will not be finding out."
3,There's a Treat At The End.,This simple little book illustrates the life of a butterfly. From an egg to a caterpillar to butterfly. The illustrations are bright and colorful and can capture a child's imagination. The book is quite short and the last page contains a 3-D pop-up of a full grown butterfly.
3,Not too shabby,"Very neat device.Handwriting recognition works pretty well, but may take some getting use to if you are a Palm user, as I am. Can be tedious at times... but far easier to use than the Virtual Keyboard option.Don't liek the fact that it has no DVD/CD/3.5"" floppy drives. The two USB ports can be used to add those drives externally but then it defeats the portability...Love the pen... beats a mouse, although I can't see playing realy games with it.Speed is a bit sluggish at times.The fold/swivel to a normal keyboard is alos very nice.Overall it is a nice device but lacks some serious items that would make it a laptop replacement. Not worth the steep price just to be able to fold it and use a pen with it. I could justify paying about half the price..."
3,Nice look and features - but falls short,"The look and feel of this phone is great. Lots of memory forphone numbers, interchangeable faceplates, BUTThere's no backlight so you have to be in good light toread the display.It saves all numbers as 10 digit - OK if you're in a 10 digit calling area - bad if you're not as there's no way to edit them and 7 digit numbers have to be entered manually, making the call back feature of CID useless.Although the sound quality is good, there's a pronounced echo when speaking that makes the phone annoying to use."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this phone and 1 additional handset about 3 years ago. It worked well for about a year. First the LED screen on one phone went blank, now the LED on the second phone has also gone blank. Sound quality is generally poor. I originally purchased this because of the price - one of the least expensive multi handset cordless phones. Not worth it. I'm now looking to replace the system."
1,Drops and Makes Clicking Noises,This is a terrible phone. The phone will constantly make clicking noises that only the caller on the other end will hear. There is a loud echo which makes it very annoying to talk with.TERRIBLE PHONE!!!
3,Does not have all the functionality listed,I bought this telephone specifically because it is listed by Amazon as having speakerphone functionality. On receiving the telephone I found that this is not the case. The misrepresentation by Amazon has caused me considereable inconvenience.
5,I loved the series,"I was to read the book for school and I'm glad that I did read it, Isobelle Carmody is a great author and she has a fantastic imagination. I loved all her other books as well. I just hope that she could write faster cause I'm not a very patient person!!!"
3,get it from the library,i liked the fantasy world Carmody created and all the magical powers the misfits had. But i really felt like the characters were one dimensional especially our main character Elspeth. I never really felt like i knew her and i didn't care about her much. We were never even told how old she is (unless i missed that part). Also i think this book would have been improved if there had been some subplots and more developed dynamics between the characters.
5,this book was SOOOO....... awsome,The deep theme of obernewtyn mixed into a deeper theme of apocolips makes this book amazing and compelling! I like the way that the mane caricter can begin so insignificant than becomes mixed up in a cobweb of mysery and the doom of fate.
4,Enchanthing,"Carmody's Obernewtyn is a magnificent read. It's a ""young adult"" book that can be enjoyed be people of all ages. I loved it. In fact, after reading the copy I checked out from the library, I had to buy a copy for myself. I'll be eagerly awaiting Tor's release of the second book later this year."
5,Obernewtyn is formidiably imaginative.,"This pearl of a book uses common ingredients in an uncommon combination, with spectacular results. The characterization is vivid, the writing fluid, and the plot good enough to keep you guessing. But best of all is that this book has sequels which only get better..."
5,Great Speeches by African Americans,"Great Speeches by African Americans: Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Barack Obama, and Others (Thrift Edition)This book really makes one understand the horrid feelings still carried by African Americans after Slavery was officially abolished. the speech by Frederick Douglass is spell binding."
4,How Far We Have Fallen,This is a good book for beginning scholars. I learned:Who Mary Church Terrel is.How far African people have fallen psychologically.How great African people can be.And More...
4,Wonderful Collection,"It was wonderful to find a compilation of full length speeches by African Americans. The speeches span from 1843 to 2005, and include lesser known speakers such as Henry Highland Garnet and Jermain Wesley Loguen, to the renowned Booker T. Washington and W.E.B Du Bois. As interesting and historically significant, if not coincidental, and timely, are speeches by Shirley Chisholm, and Barack Obama. Both were graduates of Columbia University. While Ms. Chisholm was the first African American female to hold office in the House of Representatives, Mr. Obama is the first African American male to hold an office in the Senate, since reconstruction. Additionally, one sought, while the other is seeking to hold the highest office in the United States - President. This compilation is a great addition to any household library."
4,Good game for a great price,Fight Night: Round 3 has solid graphics and great game play. It has real-life characteristics and provides an engaging career mode. It's is a great game at a great price.
4,Fun game,"It's a pretty fun game, playing against the AI gets a little monotonous after a while, but playing with friends never gets old. Overall 4/5"
4,your hands will hurt!,"after about 4 hours of play you will notice some pain and thats called ""i can't stop playing"" graphics are great the game play is sweet with 5 or 6 different controller confif.overall hours of fun and ""the bronx bull"" aka ""ragging bull"" is in this game o yeah!"
1,Disappointed....,"Well what can i say, amazon service was great but when i got this game and try it in my console it wont work. It says like version incompatiblity, well i check out amazon specs and didn't find anything that might prevent for not playing this game. if only i knew regarding region games that can only work in other region i wouldnt spend time and money buying this game at amazon."
5,Where's Foreman?,I have fight night round two. but it doesn't have george foreman. Does this one have him i want to get it if he is in it.
4,My Brother's Favorite,"After Madden and Bouldergate, this is his favorite XBOX 360 game. He doesn't even like to watch boxing but he loves this game"
4,Great boxing game!,"If you like boxing or any kind of fighting sport, then you will like this game. I'm not a huge fan of boxing games...I think the last one I played before this one was Evander Holyfields game on Sega. Obviously it's been a while. But I was once addicted to that game also. Train, fight, train, fight, train, fight. repetitive, but that's how boxing really is. Great game and highly recommended."
4,Anyone will like it,"I belive anyone who plays this game will like it. The graphics are great on 360 and the fight scenes are really realistic. It is a good game over all and is pretty fun. Although I did get a little board after the second time I rented it. I only wish there were a few more options, but don't get me wrong I do like this game."
4,Arcade Boxing... but still fun,"If you want a Boxing simulation, this isn't the game for you. This is very much an arcade style game. However, as far as arcade boxing goes this is probably the best one since Mike Tyson's Punch Out.The controls are intuitive and make for some furious bouts between you and your friends. The knock out camera (combined with the sound effects) will definitely get a reaction from your friends in the room when someone is knocked out. It's visceral.However, it lacks a realistic ladder system, realistic ring-crafting, and a sense of shame (the advertisements that are plastered all over the game are pretty sickening)."
4,"Fun, but not durable","We got this for Christmas. Its not at all durable.Track and cars need to be put together ""just right"".I had it working quite well for a few days, with the carszipping about nicely, but now nothing. The track lookscorrectly connected, the cars appear ok, but niether caron either side work - track is dead Jim.Very disapointing. I noticed this same manufacturer haspretty bad reviews for other race car products."
5,Fun!,"The set worked very well right out of the box. Very easy to set up, however the wires for the controllers were a bit short. The cars stay on the track very well.It would also be nice if they gave you some examples of other configurations for the set."
2,fun but needs a little work,the track is nice but keeps having a lot of dead spots in it so we had to take alot of the pieces out to get it to work and the cars need to be a little more like the old afx cars.
1,"Nice track, but NO cars!","My son received this for Christmas, and patiently waited until today (Dec. 26th) when we got home to open the set and put it together.Looks great, but it's useless because this set has NO CARS!Talk about disappointment!"
5,If only it were more,"This single, with two tracks, sounds very Roxette, even though you can hear a slight difference from the 70's Marie and today's Marie.The other track, the Rox Medley ... is a wonderful remix of 5 of our favourite hits. And anyone who loves Roxette HAS to own this medley. I am curious if it is all new, the tempo is upbeat, and the whole arrangement is, in a word, wonderful!There's talk of Roxette getting back together seriously. That's my ONE WISH!!! Despite Marie's health she still sounds ABFAB. She may not have the energy, and instant spontaneity to hit the road (touring!) but if the world could have another Roxette album ...so this single fixed a fix."
2,OK recipe,"First I am picture guy and not having what end product will looks like is a big turn off for me. Second, I tried 3 or 4 recipes and all turned out to be OK. Wife was not impressed after all my attempts.I bought this used so did not spend too much money on it so its ok however my recommendation is don't buy this new and pay tons of money for OK recipe."
4,delightful change,"I bought this book out of curiosity and was happily satisfied by it. The recipes create flavorful, delicious, and satisfying main courses and side dishes.The one problem I found with this book is that not all of the ingredients are listed before the directions. Some appear in the directions."
5,Madhur Jaffrey's World -Of- The- East Vegetarian Cooking,"This is one of several Madhur J's books that I have, and as usual there are too many recipes I can't wait to try. Also, you do not have to be a vegetarian to buy this book. It probably helps if you enjoy veggies! The recipes are super simple too! This cookbook is absolutely brilliant!"
3,Adjust seasoning...,"The instructions are pretty clear and correct. But in following them, I don't think I've ever made anything which didn't leave the stove wanting spices, salt, garlic, or hot pepper. I'd recommend anything by Book Publishing Company or Moosewood over Jaffrey's tempting, consistently diverse but bland offerings."
5,This is an excellent instructional book.,"I taught myself to cook Indian cuisine from this book. Although I now own a number of vegetarian cook books, I find myself returning to ""World of the East.."" again and again. I found the glossary of exotic ingredients extremely helpful. One of her recipes, apricot chutney, is a mainstay in my holiday gift baskets. The chutney has even been mistaken for ""Major Grey's"" before. I would recommend this book to anyone with a little cooking experience who wants to broaden their cooking horizons."
4,Madhur rocks!,"the first time I tried a recipe from this book was thanks to a friend who owned the first edition from the eighties. since then, the book was on my wish list for a long time, it took me a while to find another copy again (it was out of print).the qualities of the book can be summarized as follow. first, the recipes are simple to reproduce: even the most elaborate Persian treats are easy to make. second, their variety is incredibly rich, from Korean kim-chi to the most elaborate Indian curry.as a lover of international vegetarian cuisine and definitely an experimenter, I find this one of the most comprehensive, unpretentious complete book I could have on my kitchen shelf.the only flaw: every time I cook a new recipe I have to increase a bit the amount of spices suggested. definitely not a book for those who expect to produce very hot dishes."
5,Indispensable Part of my Kitchen !,"I picked this book up on a whim well over a decade ago, thinking I should add more variety to my kitchen. It's been the best spontaneous purchase I ever made. There is not a single recipe in this book that is marginal.It has definitely pushed the limitations of what use to be my conventional spice rack and taken me on a culinary tour, but my extended family now love a samosa and my kids love a dosa, chutneys in tow!There are many many vegan recipes that even the staunchest of carnivores will love."
3,Average,"Old charts, Joe Francis does imitations of Frank Sinatra, but he has a great deal of difficulty staying on key!!!"
3,More Definitions of Culture than You'll ever Need,"Kroeber compiled almost all the definitons of culture available at the time when this book was written. Although the number seems overwhelming, the collection served at the time to show the various views of the field as much as the diverse ways of looking at culture. The usual historical approach to culture, pioneered by Kroeber, was being added to by anthropologists interested in personality, notably Clyde Kluckhohn. The structural funhctional approach added considerably more viewpoints.The book today is valuable for anyone interested in the history of anthropology."
5,An excellent read!,"If you enjoy writing that is lyrical, whimsical, and perceptive, and if you enjoy reading of lives that fall outside of the usual pattern, you will thoroughly enjoy accompanying Gabriel Weinreich from his secular Jewish childhood in Poland to being plunged, during early adolescence, into a bustling New York City, and from there to life as a father, a physicist, and eventually, an Anglican priest. Along the way you will meet his father, a man devoted to the preservation and development of the Yiddish language, an indomitable mother and even more indomitable grandmother. He will offer his insights in regard to matters such as science and music. And above all he will share his slowly growing appreciation of religion and what it means to him, even as he takes care to clarify that these are very much personal views, not incumbent on the reader to share. This is a book of both wit and originality. Enjoy!"
3,Goon Town,"I'm on the fence with my feelings for PM Dawn music. It's really good but when it's bad it's reeealy bad. There is alot of uneeded typical 90's rap on here and those songs I immeadiately skip over. I was only able to listen to 4 songs all the way thru on The Bliss album. I liked For The Love Of Destiny, Norweigian Wood and the 2 hits Looking Thru Patient Eyes and I'd Die Without U. Pm Dawn was trying to go in the direction of a really ""important"" band but ending up coming across as just another 90's pop/rap group. Some of their music is timeless but all u really need are the hits."
3,I'D Die Without You!,"I first heard of P.M. Dawn who was originally from New Jersey who went to London, England to get recorded. Anyway, I loved the song, ""I'd Die Without You,"" which was used for the Boomerang film soundtrack. The Boomerang film starred Eddie Murphy. Except for that song, I really didn't care for the others. I listen to them but they don't have the same intensity as ""I'd Die Without You."" Apart from that song, the compact disc is worth listening and I wondered if the group is still together even after all these years."
4,Thought Life Would Hand You Bliss?,"Someone called Price Be the Brian Wilson of Hip Hop, and I think there's truth to that. This album matches the breadth of Pet Sounds, although it strikes too many false chords to send it totally into Blissland. The melodies though! About Nothing and More Than Likely make you melt. And the funk of Plastic and Nocturnal in the House provide good countpoint. In my opinion, the cover of Norwegian Wood and I'd Die Without You have no reason for being, but they're easily skipped. If you miss tunefulness in your rap, try this!"
3,This is not a SACD,"Why does everyone keep stating that this is a SACD,trust me its not.As for the music this is a well composed CD.This CD is like walking through some fantasy land and coming across up and down beats and what can you say about the Princes voice.Boy George jumps in for a little action as well.This Cd takes me back to my college days which is nice.Once again this is not a SACD but that doesnt make the music bad"
1,No Sound in Video Mode AT ALL !!!!,"One thing that bothers me the most with this camera... is that when in video mode, the video takes no sound!!! Similar models from Canon offer digital cameras that record sound; therefore, I cannot recommend this product at all."
2,I hate this camera,Every photo I've taken has been fuzzy and unclear.Also the color is not true. I know it's the camera as I have Sony camera that is near perfect. I can't wait to get rid of this piece of junk. Plus the Camedia software that came with this camera didn't work on my computer!
2,Disappointed,"When I received my new Olympus Camera, I was so happy. I have used several Olympus cameras and have been very pleased in their performances. But, even though this camera took beautiful shots, the battery life was terrible. I had to use the LED display for the view finder since there was none included in this camera. I had to change and recharge the batteries 4 times to take images of one birthday party. I returned it after talking to a helpful technical assistant for Olympus. He said to get a lithium battery that it would last longer. But he didn't know if Olympus had battery rechargers for this camera. He used a Kodak for his photography."
2,good camera for temporary use,My problems with this camera started to happen after six months. The retractable lens started to get jammed. Now the camera will come on then shut off with the lens still out. This camera is a piece of junk and I would never recommend it to anyone.
5,Great little camera,"Great image at 6.0 m-pixels, large LCD at 2.5"", very simple and easy point-and-shoot camera. Fits easily in a shirt pocket. A winner!"
2,Dissapointed!,"I've been very happy with Olympus products and bought this camera to replace my older Olympus D-580 (great camera, by the way) and was dissapointed from the moment I took the first picture. Both indoor and outdoor pictures come out in blueish-greyish tones. Even with the flash the indoor pictures were dull and grey. Flash seems to be not powerful enough to take a good bright picture even close up. The shutter is fast, but it's very hard to take a clear sharp picture - most of my pictures came out blurry. I tried different settings, but still wasn't happy. I liked the small size of the camera and the big LCD but had to bring the camera back to the store. I would not recommend this camera."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this camera in a pinch when the refurbished Fuji I bought for an important weekend crapped out within hours. The FE-170 is a decent camera, but I expected a lot more. The pictures seem saturated to me, with a kind of blue-pink rosy hue. The features are kind of dumbed down, and don't really offer much for those of us who like to tweak settings. No sound on video and no black and white setting. Everything else aside, the biggest problem I've had by far is with red eye. Almost every picture we took inside ended up with red-eye. Far more then any other camera I've used. There is a red-eye flash setting, but it is manual and not very effective. I'm surprised to see that others had so much luck with it, just as I was by how unimpressed I became. I think my old Sony takes a better picture to this day with far less Mega pixels."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"I got this camera as a gift and after taking pictures I decided to hook it up to my computer to upload. The computer doesn't recognize the camera and I can't upload any photos. After 6 emails and 3 phone calls in the past 3 days, Olympus still had no solution to my problem. Don't buy this camera or any other Olympus product."
4,Great product that moisturizes and protects,I am a philosophy girl and I love this product in particular. It is a good moisturizer with that all important feature of spf protection. I put it on everyday. My only complaints are the expense and that I need it in a bigger size.
1,horrible phone,The phone is horrible. It worked OK for about a year and then just started going downhill. The caller ID cannot be read at all and there is no way to get a hold of the co. The website is not valid any longer.
2,Many Features but poor quality phone,"The features and price are great.BUT, the auto-channel search doesn't let you decide when you need a new channel. It also beeps on the other end when it decides to change, which is very often at my house. Needless to say, you can't hear what the other person is saying when it is switching channels.The display lost vertical lines of pixels after about a year, so you can't read it anymore. Also, the Mute/Pause button is labeled Clear/Delete for use in the menus. I have also erroneously disconnected calls because it is right next to the On/Off button.If you can spend a little more, keep looking."
1,Wrong Item Sent!,"Ordered HWM1806 (with helo, blimp ...) and received a package of regular cars. The assortment sent to us is not what we ordered."
3,Misleading title,"This dvd has many yoga poses. The menu will take you to a specific subset of these poses by choosing a sport and/or body part to work.The pace is to hold each pose for 10-20 seconds, then switch to the next pose. If you are used to Iyengar classes, this will seem fimilliar -- for others though, it may lack movement and flow. The tone is relaxed and gentle, and the workout is average; nowhere near as challenging as, say Ashtanga yoga. There is decent instruction for each pose.Overall, I think there are better products out there."
5,Yoga for Athletes,"Though the title states it's for atheletes, It helped me with my stretching and I enjoyed it. Great price and will refer to family and friends."
2,Big disappointment...,"I am a rock climber and was really excited to try this dvd. When I read others' reviews that said the dvd had ""no flow"", I figured it wouldn't really bother me (I love bikram yoga - and often the poses don't actually flow together). But this dvd is ridiculous. EVERY pose is literally seperated by a black screen and announcement, then most of the poses are done painfully slow. The poses are cut and pasted to fulfill the many, many options for work-outs, which really aren't that different (I've fast forwarded through a lot of them). It you have any yoga experience, this will drive you nuts! Also, there is absolutely no warm-up, and only some of the poses suggest a modified form. My friend who is an avid cyclist and also occasionally does yoga, agrees that this dvd is a huge disappointment."
3,Pretty Decent But Hoped for Warm ups,"I like the workouts alright. I wasn't to concerned about the ""flow"" b/c ihave a ton of other dvds for flowing yogas.I like the idea of holding the poses for building strength but I thinks its also dangerous to get into these routines without a good sun salutations warm-up. The first time I tried it without the warm-up i pulled a muscles, now i do Shiva Rea's Sun Salutations before going into one of these practices."
5,Great Workout!,"I purchased this DVD as a replacement to an original copy of the same DVD lost somewhere in my travels. I use this DVD regularly and love that I can customize my workouts to the sport or activity I do and that I can further customize the workout to specific areas of my body where I may need more flexibility or strength. The instructions led by a calm voice are easy to follow without twisting your body out of position to see what the athlete on the screen is doing, and the model in the video is ripped! and not bad to look at. I'd highly recommend this video to any athlete who is looking for more flexibility and strength."
3,slow but informative,This yoga DVD has a great concept going for it. Being able to custom my workout to this level is amazing. I can choose what I want to do and how long I want to do it. The only problem that I have with it is that each position takes at LEAST 3-5 min to get into and hold. IT IS SO SLOW!!! I would say that this is a great DVD for beginners as it explains & shows many angels for each position. This allows a beginner to get the most out of each position without the chance of injury. It is great for my boys. They are new to yoga & like that there are not any women in this DVD.
5,great workout,"Being a runner my whole life, i was looking for something to keep in shape during the winter months and this dvd was it. i read about it in runner's world and i thought that i would give it a try. i loved that i can customize my workout specifically for runners but i also can do workouts designed for athletes of different sports. and the ""quickreview"" feature is helpful getting the instructions a second time. i strongly recommend picking it up."
4,I like The DVD,Lots of programs and workouts to fit every occasion. I have to admit have not really seen other DVDs such as this that are catered specifically to the athlete. There are challenging workouts and slower versions to fit your taste. Defintely had no complaints.
5,"Any sport, any level","I always thought yoga was something my wife and her girlfriends did and never considered it for myself until my son came home on a school break and told me the coach had them doing yoga... and he was liking it. He had this video with him and we did a workout together. I thought it was worth buying my own copy and I've been using it a couple times a week. Right now I'm doing the ski and basketball workouts since those are my winter activities. There's a lot on this video, lots of different sports and also different muscle groups to work on. Guys, yoga isn't just for your wife. Give it a try. It's really good."
1,Total Waste of Time-Don't Bother,"This DVD is nothing more than an encyclopedia of yoga poses. The female narrator uses a monotone voice to explain the pose, the man follows the narration. Then the frame freezes and moves onto the next pose. There is no flow, there is no dance, there is no celebration of Yoga on this DVD. If you want a how-to perform-a-pose guide, that is all this DVD provides. I want my money back. I read the reviews listed on this page before I bought and they must be written by friends of the promoters and not yoga enthusiasts."
2,Not Explanetory Enough,"This disc has workouts for almost any sport you can think of, using accessible yoga poses (plank, warriors, etc.) So, if you're looking to have a restorative workout, it is OK.However, there is abosolutely NO explanation about why these sequences were chosen or how they support a given sport.Also, since all of the sequences choose from the same 40 or so poses, the running sequence is oddly like the golf one. Not very satisfying, and didn't help me achieve my goal of understanding how yoga supports atheletes of different flavors.Am going to buy Sage Roundtree's book on the subject..."
2,yoga for athletes,"The DVD is OK, except that it's hard to watch. Some guy without his shirt on going through the moves with a very boring, monotone woman's voice in the background."
3,Annoying instructor; Great abs workout,"This guy is really hard to watch. I get really annoyed with him. The warm-ups are unbearably slow, so I have to fast-forward thru them. But the ABS workout is amazing. I did it for a month and could see actual muscles on my stomach. It's not easy, but worth it."
5,a truly dark fantasy,"This is excellent horror fantasy novel about a young woman who is a victim of a family curse to turn into a werewolf. She is the only one that can save her friends and the man she loves from cabal of satanists bend on destroying them all! This novel boasts scenes of eroticism and black magic, gruesome violence and a truly wicked final twist."
1,Not Worth It,Awful allegory story line so you don't get that much Duke and Duchess. Best shots are in the trailer. Tacky at best
5,An Amazon Marketplace Purchase,I was rather disappointed with this video. It jumped back and forth between the current day and the real story of Wallis and Edward in such a way it took a few moments to figure out where it was. Also it really didn't make much sense in the present day story which was quite confusing. I had expected so much more. The only other Madonna film I had seen was Evita and it was so much better.The video was delivered very quickly and was in excellent condition. I wish I could say as much for the actual story.
3,Uneven,"Parts of this story are quite good, especially the parts focusing on Wallis and David/Edward in the 1930s. The modern parts do not work nearly as well. Also, the anachronistic music used during the benzedrine-laced drink scene is ridiculous and unnecessary.The actors do pretty well under the circumstances though."
2,Madonna Who?,"I've been waiting for this DVD since I pre-ordered it in February. The film was never shown in my area, and I live in Philly - not exactly a remote, rural area - now I know why! Madonna's directorial debut should also be her swan song (bad pun intended!). I wanted a film about Wallis Simpson, instead I saw a film about a boringly abused, trying-to-get-pregnant, woman fantasizing about the Duchess of Windsor. I'm sure this film was meant to be seen on ""Lifetime"" television at two o'clock in the morning,and NOT on the ""big screen!"" I think I've either found a cure for insomnia, or a reason to relish root canal!"
5,Loved it!,It was a hear pounding love story that had me hanging on every word of every scene! If you like complex romances you will love this movie!
1,W.E. ad nauseum,I agree with Roger Ebert...this is a relentlessly monotonous film. Perhaps it's time to stop trying to focus on this particular peculiar relationship.. how many ways can you say the same thing?
2,yeah.........,"Just rented this.. I have to say it is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. The love story itself would have been great, it is a beautiful story in real life but.... it got lost in a mess... I'm still not sure what the point of the second plot line was or why it was relevant to the story... I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and another 5 minutes writing this review. To end on a positive note, the costumes and stylization of the movie was beautiful."
2,Did not enjoy it,"I would have liked the movie without the story of Wally from 1998. This movie reminds me so much of Ararat by Atom Egoyan, The way it is told from modern day then goes back in time and focuses on an art auction/gallery. Hmmm, wonder if Alek Keshishian saw that. It was boring!"
4,WE,This movie is artistic and beautiful done in a style reminiscent of Tom Ford. It is beautiful and a joy to watch.
4,This is a wonderful film with an interesting way of telling the story,W.E. is a remarkable achievement by Madonna. Her top stars play the parts of Edward and Wallis to the hilt. I am also happpy with the present day duo. The chemistry of both couples carries the film. I love the story of Wallis and Edward. It gives clear details of what was just a minor blip before on my history screen. Suprised how much she gave up for love.
1,A horrible film,"This DVD was a big waste of money! There was nothing in it to make you CARE about the characters. I am knowledgeable about the Windsors and the abdication, and this film just glossed over the event."
4,The Spirit of Wallis Living Through Today,"I just watched W.E. and this film was well written, giving anyone who isn't famliar with this story good details. What intrigued me most about this film was after watching ""The King's Speech"" we were given a follow up on the romance between Wallis and King Edward. Wallis's character made you dislike her at times for interferring with a romance that was already in place and yet loved her for being herself which commanded King Edwards attention at all times, unlike his beautiful female companion whom he known for sometime. I like how Madonna showed the similaraties between the modern Wallis with the original Wallis S.It felt like Madonna wanted movie watcher to see how the lives of the two woman would interwine through feelings of understanding real love conquers, even if one must go through some tragic events to smell a bit of roses. I give this movie four and a half stars, because I would have liked to have seen more of the story line played out."
4,Arrived very quickly...,"in good condition and as described...glad I didn't pay more, it was not the story I expected. Rather bazarre treatment of this historical event."
2,Not what I expected!,Not many exercises and it's a medium size book. i just was not impress. I didn't like it to use in my class.
4,Four stars for the episodes - one star for the pricing!,"Let's see - almost the same price for 32 of the best Season One episodes as they are charging for just 17 of the Season Two shows, which everyone knows are generally not up to par with the first. I half expected SOME sort of extras for the high price. Maybe the pilot episode, 'cause it wouldn't have fit on the first package. Maybe some interviews or behind-the-scenes stuff. Nothing - but the high price! Some of my favorite episodes are in this season (Demon with a glass hand, The Inheritors - damn, I even love the Eddie Albert vehicle Cry of Silence), but this was an out-and-out rip compared to the value of the first season. Shame on MGM!"
4,Why Pay More? Only If you're Picky!,"The original Outer Limits TV series is an excellent example of how great story telling and relatively fine acting could be accomplished on a low budget back in the 60's. The special effects however poor and cheesy by today's standards were very imaginative and fairly ground breaking for the time. Great stuff, and not just in a ""So Bad its Good"" way. I bought this set to replace a damaged disc in the more expensive remastered set. The images are not quite so clearly defined as in that more expensive set but the difference is not really significant; the picture is somehow warmer more like I remember it growing up. This set is more than just good enough it is a great value."
3,Outer Limits Season 2,Product is okay but picture qualiity is not up to season 1. Forewarned about packaging but bought anyway; must agree with other complaints in this area. Understand that seasons 2-7 are Canadian produced. Hopefully whoever released season 1 will at some point release the others.
3,couldnt watch inheritors part1 or i.robot,"i would have given 5 stars but disk 2 was defective. so i could only see part 2 of the inheritors. and i missed seeing again i,robot that was way better than the movie except for special effects. anyways i wish that mgm and universal would quit using 2 sided disks they always come up with a defective disk."
5,"Excellent TV series, bad DVD packaging.","This is an excellent show, I bought all the seasons. Unfortunately the DVD packaging from Canada is absolutely useless and damaging to the DVDs. The majority of the DVD sets arrived with DVDs loose and damaged. I have a machine that resurfaces the DVDs and that is what I had to do with many of them. I now have them in individual sleeves so the damage will not continue to happen. Since only season 1 has been released in the US and a compilation set was released as well, I had no choice but to order the Canadian releases. I am glad I did even though I had to do some disc restoring. If you can fix your DVDs I would recommend getting this series in its entirety. Unfortunately, the other negative here is that the Canadian releases have cut nudity (brief as it was) and language from the series. Makes no sense to me. The series was made and filmed in Canada, why edit your own series. Show it the way it was originally filmed. I don't get it ?"
4,Sellers Please Watch Disc Two Before SELLING!!!!,I just want the sellers to completely watch disc two before they sell it because I have puchased three sets with the same problem and now I going to start giving bad feedback.There is simply no excuse anymore.
2,The packaging makes me afraid to buy this!,"I am qualified to write this review because I recently owned the entire series on VHS, and just a few weeks ago I gave them to the public library so that many can be ""turned on"" to this great classic sci-fi series for free. I thought I would just order these neat DVD's and replace my VHS collection.Now I read about people having trouble with the packaging and the double-sided DVDs.So, why is it that someone can make a profit selling a recent series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer with 22 episodes on six single-sided discs for well under $50.00, but the people who put this set out are selling 17 episodes of an almost 40 year old series on three double-sided discs, which is just a set-up for damage even if handled carefully?So here's what I want...The ENTIRE series on SINGLE sided discs in ONE box, and I would happily pay at least $120.00 for that. After all, collecting all those VHS tapes cost be about $400.00, but they sure take up space!"
1,Original Outer Limits Season 2,Like Season 1 I enjoy having my own set of The Outer Limits. I have always like the series since seeing it when originally aired in the 60's.Robert A. Soles
1,This DVD is inaccurate!,"DO NOT BUY this DVD if you have volume 1 of this series. Volume 3, however, is different and will complete your collection. I bought this mistakenly believing it was different from volume 1 and IT ISN'T! How they get away with calling this DVD volume 2 is beyond me. I gave this DVD away to my housemate."
5,Thanks MGM / United Artists,"Thanks for preserving this sci-fi classic from the 60's and making it available on the superior DVD format. The episodes look and sound great.If you are familiar with ""The Outer Limits"" (the original series), you already know why it's special. If you are not, buy this DVD collection, insert disc 2 and watch ""The Inheritors"" starring Robert Duval and Steve Ihnat. See what Hollywood was capable of producing (in black and white and even with primitive special effects) at one time in history and, sadly, how far the entertainment industry has fallen."
3,"Product flaws, BUYERS BEWARE","The series is undoubtedly classic and a must own, however, there seems to be a manufacturing flaw with the double-density disks. Sides 1 of disks 1 and 2 do not seem to play. Sides 2 play fine. One both my home unit and my computer I get an error about the disks being damaged. This has surfaced in another review and MGM seems to be ignoring quality which is a shame. Also, the audio seems to fluctuate, obviousely more technical problems. I had no problems with series 1. Guess I'll have to pop in my old VHS version to catch the Inheritors part 2. Disappointed."
2,Outer Limits - Season 2 (The Defective Edition),"I got the original and two replacements from amazon -- now they won't send it any more. Reading other reviews, I know I'm not alone in getting defective disks, but is there any way to get a non-defective product?"
4,outstanding EXCEPT,"i bought both season'sthe first season dvd worked perfect and i enjoyed them very muchbut as others have stated the second season dvd's were flawedthey froze, digitized, wouldn't read at all"
2,OL Light: Half The Episodes at All the Price,"So call me a cheapskate but I did purchase the OL season 1 set, I just can't see why I would shell out my hard earned greenbacks to buy 1/2 the episodes of season one just to see 2 or 3 good episodes. I didn't grow up on this show (I'm a Star Trek TOS kid), but I did see it on reruns and I usually caught the crappy episodes (yes this series had quite a few of them, probably from season 2). All in all I think I'll rent this set and check out the few good episodes available. As far as the newer Showtime production, there's just something about remakes that doesn't get it for me. I watched a few but they just didn't entertain me as much."
3,Outer Limits season 2,"Season 2 only lasted 17 episodes and was then canceled.Two of the best episodes are on this season, ""I Robot"" and ""The Demon with a Glass Hand"" !Some of the later episodes turned in monster of the week and went away from the Science Fiction.Had no problems with my disks from about 1999."
3,Outer Limits 2 orginal series,"I am going to rate this transaction as a 3 for now. The contents of the show is a 5 star, acting is great, i personally like this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who who like to see a great sci-fi show from the early days. The reason for this rating is the side 2 of disk 3 has two of the episodes which will not play properly. I have been able to view only fifteen of the seventeen episodes. To be fair i have just contacted MGM to see if they will send me a replacement disk 3 so i can view the two episodes which would not play... we all know that these problems happen from time to time. I will see how MGM responds and then i will know if it ends up a 5 Star or 1 Star... i hope its a Five Star. Would like to follow up to let everyone know how it turned out."
2,"Too much talk, not enough different music","Didn't realize when I bought this, that there'd be so much talking in it, and what songs there were, were a lot of the same songs over & over. Interesting to listen to once, but that's it. I got other Elvis records the same day I got this one, so I'm keeping the others and giving this one away."
2,Too much narration,"The music tracks on this cd are great, but be warned--the music is interspersed with an enormous amount of narration. It should be made more clear on the packaging that this meant to be some sort of audio documentary. If that's what you're after, you might like this, but I have no idea why the producers decided to totally halt the momentum of the album by interrupting the music to give information that is included in the liner notes. Very frustrating!"
3,"Good book, but not quite what I expected","The book covers the basics of creating a logo, stationary system, and newsletter. There are no hands-on exercises or data files to go with the book."
3,Design it Yourself:Graphic Workshop,Although many reviews felt that this was a necessary addition to their graphic design library - I felt that it was too elementary for me. I am a very experienced designer and graphic design professor and I found the projects too simplistic. If I had an opportunity to thumb the book prior to purchase - I would not have purchased this title. It is really for beginners.
1,Both phones do not work at same time.,"Be warned if you buy this set that you can only use one handset at a time, which completely defeats the purpose of having two!"
2,fascinating subject; abysmal writing,"This is, obviously, a fascinating subject & the author's research appears to be adequate. However, there is hardly a sentence which does not include at least one error in spelling, grammar, words, or dates. For instance, dates which should begin with ""18"" often begin with ""19."" The author does not seem to have a clue when to use the word ""principle"" and when to use ""principal."" She has no idea when to use ""it's"" & when to use ""its."" For anyone who cares about decent writing, this is a hard book to read. Overuse if Spellcheck may be part of the problem but real ignorance is also a problem. Whatever became of editors?"
5,a wonderful CD-rom experience,"bantock's work translates wonderfully to the computer. the use of music, voice readings, animated cards, ambient noises and of course his wonderful artwork makes for a haunting experience. the interface is intuitive and your level of ""interaction"" doesn't intrude at all on this magical love story."
1,Terrible Service,"I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back (late per their initial promise, by the way). I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products."
5,Best Purchase Ever,"This is the coolest gadget you can buy. Don't listen to how ""complicated"" this thing is. For myself, I concentrate on the TV recording and don't really mess with the other functions as much, which are plentiful by the way. You can even transform this thing into a tiny camcorder if you buy the lipstick camera accessory.I have had my Archos for several months and this is what I find to best way to get the most most out of it: It is all about the TIVO. I get my season passes lined up as well as any other programs I want to watch on the go and allow the recordings to pile up a bit. Then on a Saturday or Sunday I will hook up the Archos and play the programs recorded from TIVO and record them directly back to the Archos. Just hit record and come back to it every hour or two until you have yourself a nice collection of shows."
1,DON'T BUY AN ARCHOS!!!,"I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my daughter. Within a month after Christmas the battery failed to charge. I contacted Archos and had to return the unit and not just the battery. I was also informed that I would probably not get the same unit back. I received a different unit that contained the previous owners recordings. This took approximately 2.5 weeks. Ten days after receiving the refurbished unit back, the hard drive failed. I contacted customer support and requested that I receive a new unit and not a refurbished one. I was informed that that was probably not possible. I find this pretty poor support for a product with a price tag as high as this. Because I am beyond the 30 day return period from Amazon I have no choice but to work with Archos. I would not recommend this product or any Archos product for that matter and would warn future customers to purchase a different brand."
3,Hard disk crashed,"Beware of your archos.My Archos AV500's hard disk crashed after only 20 days of use, fortunately, i had copied all my photos from the unit to the PC just the day before.I sent the unit for repair (at least 40 days).Also, it didn't work with a Canon 20D for transfering photos, i have to use a card reader."
4,Love them,"I was pleasantly surprised at the fit of these bras. Sure saved alot of time and money not having to shop for them. I had found one months ago at a discount store and loved it. So instead of running back to the big city and spending all day and gas money, I tried ordering the same ones and they are great. I hate shopping for bras."
3,very comfortable but...,"This is a very comfortable bra, as advertized, however the first time I wore it the hook broke on the back. It is not the most supportive bra I've ever worn, but it is comfortable. I just expected better quality."
1,Returned,"I bought this bra along with three others (same size, different companies). The others were fine, but the Olga was very small - as if it was sized incorrectly. I returned it immediately. Wish I had something better to say"
5,Olga Women's Full Figure Seamless Signature Support Bra,Absolutely wonderful for full figures. Very supportive. Very comfortable. Seamless to wear under tops that would show any woven design - like tee shirts and tank tops.
2,Bra,"This bra does not seem to be true to size. I recently purchased 2 other brands and styles in the same size that fit really well. Unfortunately, this bra (a replacement for one like it that I have been wearing for a while)is too small, even though it is the same size as the one I already own."
3,This is an UNLINED bra -- don't get chilly!,"This is an unlined bra. It makes sense -- why would ""full figured"" women need a padded bra? -- but I can see my skin through the thin ""double layer"" fabric. This bra is incredibly comfortable, but I can't give it 4 or 5 stars because I'm worried about my nipples peeping through. It would have been nice to have some coverage for that issue.PROS:- Smooth, soft fabric- Comfortable straps and band- Side supportCONS:- It will be a bit nippy in cold weatherUPDATE (10/5/2010): I've purchased a pair of Bezi Bra Discs and have been wearing them with the bra to prevent the problem mentioned above. The combination works well. I guess no bra can be perfect."
4,I love this bra.,I give this bra 4 1/2 stars. It is soft and comfortable; it holds me up and the straps never fall down - a problem I have with most bras. I keep trying other types but always come back to this one.
4,Very well written account,"This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the u-boat war. The author has a very interesting story that starts with his service on an ocean liner at the outbreak of the war. From there he goes to surface raiders and then to u-boats,eventually ending with his internment in the far east when his sub is taken over by japan when germany surrenders. There are books with more text devoted to u-boat battles than this one however the book stands out for the authors unusual oddessy which he does an excellent job in writing about. The author also provides a superb collection of photos taken by himself that provides a great accompaniment to the narrative."

3,half the songs on this album are done country style,half the songs on this album are done country style I only like the rock & roll and r&b ones.
4,Perkins & Friends,"I was plesantly surprised by this CD. This is a combination of old songs re-recorded with MANY special guest stars and new songs still with guest stars. The other reviews talk about the guests alot, so I'll just add that they all pay homage to this great rock-a-billy artist. Three cuts are from outside recordings (both Blue Suede Shoes versions and Honey Don't) but the rest are done with Carl in the studio, and Carl is the star of this show. You can hear the musicians enjoying themselves on every cut. A fine album to add to your collection, especially if you're familiar with Mr. Perkin's work. Recommended."
2,Not one of Randy's best.,"As a long time Randy Travis fan I found this latest offering too slick and the arrangements overpowered the great Travis voice. The songs lacked that traditional Travis quality of a good mix. The words were, in my opinion corny and at times seemed to roll over themselves. This is by far the worst outing Randy has made. I hope he goes back to the clean uncluttered arrangements he used when he started."
3,"ok, he's done alot better","No classic Randy here. An OK album but I expected more. I was hoping that a couple of his songs would remind me of his older stuff. Beside the voice I didn't even recognize the album. Just not as powerful as I hoped. Great artist (his voice carries the album), needs better song selection, nothing that really touched me. If you love Randy's music get it, if not passMY fovorite songs off the album:A Man Ain't made of stoneWhere Can I SurrenderOnce You Heard The TruthThirteen Mile GoodbyeI'll Be Right her Lovin' You - This one might have been picked higher but I heard Rhett Akins version first and I like Rhett's better. It's still a good song, and Randy does well with it, but I still like Rhett's version"
2,Opinions vary...,"I was disappointed with this book. If one is to accept Mr. Calleman as some authority on the Mayan calendar, then there should be some reason to do so other than listing information that may or may not be accurate.While I appreciate that the author believes what he says, I don't see any scientific connection to what he asserts or any reason I should believe it. In order for that to occur, and I'm sure the author is aware, other possible explanations for his hypotheses' must be refuted. Otherwise, his writing is little more than opinion.As a student of eastern philosophy and meditation, I admit there is a certain resonance with the author's cosmovision: however, to apply this perspective as a blanket description of the world and its many cultures and then cite how a minor few of them relate to the Mayan calendar is scurrilous at best."
2,good theory but...,"i wasn't very impressed by this book. from the title i expected more information about interpreting the mayan calander, what i got however, was a theory of how historical and future events corresponded/will correspond with certain phases of the mayan calander. while i respect the author's views, i didn't find anything in this book to help me. basically a stretch of a theory and then trying to prove it all with historical points."
4,Very informative,Have recently started this book. Am having a time with it as there is so much to remember and/or refer to. It is going slowly for me but I feel it has a heap of information that is quite interesting and makes a lot of sense. I would definately recommend this for people who want answers to the future of this planet!
1,The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness,"I am very dissatisfied with this purchase, the author talks about many issues and seldom cover the history of the Mayans. I was expecting to gain more knowlegde about them, but unfortunately to topics cover are so irrelevant."
1,An in-depth headache,"This book was highly recommended to me, so I was determined to finish it, hoping that at any page I would find something I could use.Trust me, it would be more enlightening to sit and watch paint peel.The topic is a fascinating one, but this book is just plain boring."
1,Incomprehensible,I only got up to page 110 out of 261. I can't waste any more time finishing this book.What I read was completely incomprehensible.This is a great example of how someone can get so caught up in their own theories that they begin to lose touch with reality. Either that or he already wrote a book about the Mayan calendar and ran out of material but decided to write another book anyway.Conveniently his theories match up with things like the big bang occurred 16 billion years ago. But that date keeps getting pushed back in time. The universe is probably much older. He'll probably write another book when that discovery occurs.The truth about the Mayan calendar was probably destroyed back when the Catholic church from Spain burned all the Mayan's books and destroyed their culture.Jeff Marzano
4,Thought-provoking work not to be ignored...,"Carl Johan Calleman applies a convincing interpretation of the evolution of consciousness to the Mayan Calendar system, provoking interesting possibilities over the next 6 years for energies that might become available to anyone open to working with them. Far from fatalistic, he promotes a view of rapidly increasing opportunity. Getting there however, may not be easy. The first part of the book is rather dense, and the references (to illustrations, etc.) jump all over the place, so stick with it - it's worth it."
5,A very enjoyable CD,"Buy this CD if you never thought you'd like ""Celtic"" type music. I bought this on a whim and still know nothing about the group other than what is on the CD and the other comments posted here, but it is a wonderful mix of melodic, hummable, danceable and kind of folksy music. Note that most songs are instrumentals which I like since I find most lyrics insipid, but even those with lyrics like ""whiskey town"" are very enjoyable."
5,Awesome guide!,"This is an awesome guide for who is interested in increase the Supply Chain Management knowledge.Very clear and with good examples, will help you understand such a complex theme"
3,General introduction,"As a supply chain expert for more than 10 years, I found this book abit academic and not based on practical truth.Obviously not covering all elements of supply chain but giving more theoritical information instead. Given examples are more unique to those companies. It should better to give clear guidance against practical concerns with necessary methodologies."
4,"Class Material, but applicable for many","I thought this book gave a good understanding of supply chain management issues and how to effectively manage the supply chain. It was required for a class, but a good read nonetheless."
5,"Functionable, Stable and Attractive","On-Stage DS7200B = 5 StarsI also use this stand with my Audio Technica AT2020 USB microphone and Samson SP01 shock mount. I've read other reviews stating this stand was wobbly. It is not! For the price, if you need a nice ""Desk"" stand, buy it. Very functional, stable and attractive."
2,Broke two days after use,"My first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. It worked once when I originally set it, then kaput. It's never worked properly since. I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. I would not purchase this product again."
2,"Decent Build Quality, Not Heavy Enough","The build quality on this is fairly decent, especially at the price. However the base is not heavy enough to do the job. Also, the UPC sticker was, for reasons beyond my comprehension, stuck on the mast. Even thought the product was packaged in a box. The sticker was attached with some sort of residue generating super glue which was nearly impossible to get off.I probably wouldn't bother with this stand again. If the base were a pound heavier, it'd be okay. But it's just underweight for what it is."
3,Not Universal,This wasn't compatible with my Fiances usb shure mic set up. The mini stand is heavy and made well... but not compatible with all mics.
2,Does not work with Technica AT202,I purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a AT2020 with a SP01 shockmount. Mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what I try.Please be aware.
3,Adjustable microphone stand,"I bought this to hold mike while running Audyssey on Onkyo AVR. Although it does do that, I would buy a boom or taller stand next time."
3,OK,"Received this stand 2 days after i ordered it with basic/standard delivery. It's a Mic stand...it goes up and down...it holds a Mic...what can you say. And besides, if you don't like it, you can use it for a small boat anchor."
5,Does the job!,"It's a compact metal height-adjustable stable-based thingy to mount a microphone upon (or anything else with a 5/8"" thread mount). There are five non-skid pads on the bottom that actually make this mic stand more stable than the 3-footed floor stand I was using before. If you are looking for such a thing in a black finish, this particular model might be the one for you. It works great for my application, which is elevating a microphone 13.5"" over the surface of my desk. I'm happy with it."
4,Sturdy and does the job,"I purchased this to use with an MXL large diaphragm microphone with a shock mount. It's heavy enough so that it is not tipsy. The adjustment collar is a bit flimsy feeling, but only time will tell how that holds up.I would have given it 5 stars, but this item comes with a large white UPC sticker affixed to the lower column. Because the item comes in a box, I don't know why the sticker is necessary. When you try to remove the sticker, it shreds with any bit of pressure. A minor annoyance, but I don't think I needed to spend 10 minutes with solvents to clean this up."
2,Heavy but difficult to fix position,"The stand itself seems heavy enough, and the adjustment vertically is fine, but the joint where the mic screws in never seems to get tight enough to hold the mic steadily up. I've had to tighten it with a wrench just to get it tight enough to hold upright for a few minutes, but then if I bump it a few times, as is inevitable, it sags right back down at a slant. Very annoying."
4,Best Hayes biography I know,"Hayes had an interesting life and an active time in the Civil War. This book is aimed at presenting a favorable picture of him, and is written kind of like old-fashioned biographies. It pays excessive attention ro Hayes' diary, and contains considerable trivia. Some chapters are boring. The most interesting chapters are are, obviously, on 1876 and 1877 and the dramatic events around Hayes' election to the Presidency. And yes, the Republicans stole that election too!"
2,Taiyo Yuden DVD Blanks,"Movies begin to skip near the end of the recording, i.e. where disk velocity is greatest. Admittedly, this could be the DVD burner's fault, but I have not noticed this problem with other brands such as Verbatim."
3,Received Taiyo Yuden - JVC joint product,"Not 100% TY, it was branded with JVC as well; no idea if this impacts performance but item description should be updated as well picture. Taiyo Yuden seems to be among the best out there according to my research."
1,Do not buy from this seller!!!!!!,"I ordered a shrink wrapped pack of Taiyo Yuden dvd-r s, which arrived completely opened in the box-discs all loose and flying around inside. I couldn't believe it. The shrink wrap was clinging to about a third of them. AND...the image/description of the product led me to believe that I was getting a premium grade disc-not value line. What arrived was the value line version. This was no mistake. A total rip off!"
5,Best blank media money can buy,Professionals know that different brands of blank media have different levels of quality. Taiyo Yuden (a JVC company) is the best media you can buy. You can reliably burn disks at much higher speeds without worry that you'll end up with a bad burn or glitchy copy. This is the media that professional companies use. In fact many of the DVD movies or games that you buy in the store are burned using this media.Be aware that this package doesn't come with a spindle or case to hold it. It's just 100 shrink-wrapped discs in one tall tower. It's made to be inserted into enterprise-level burning machines with automatic feeders. The label side is blank white and accepts a sharpie easily.This media costs more than some budget companies but the quality is worth it. You won't waste your time burning a disk only to end up with a bad burn and wasted disk if you buy this media.
5,99% worked,"I had very good sound and image quality results. Out of 100 discs I had two fail, much better than other DVD-R's I've used"
5,Amazing Quality,"We are currently using 10 or so Taiyo Yuden products each week to copy our church's praise services to give to shut ins, etc. I have been using Taiyo Yuden products for 3 years...NO FAILURES! Hard to believe, isn't it. Excellent quality. Ink jet printed church logos and photos on CDs and DVDs has never been more vivid/impressive. Can you tell I'm sold on Taiyo Yuden products? A penny or two more for each disk is well worth the impressive quality. You want to get it done right the first time? Look no further."
4,One of the funnest games I've played in a while,"I got this game for x-mas and I played it till I was about half way through. It is a great game. The levels are nice and you don't find yourself in the same setting for long coughhalo2cough. The reason it has gotten bad reviews is because people are comparing it to the n64 goldeneye, well, its nothing like it. I dont think it would be wise for EA to imitate a 7~8 year old n64 game (the origional goldenye was awsome though). Anyway, the reason I gave this 4 stars is because there isnt much varity of gameplay. Just fps shooting (which is fun). I havnt got all the way through the game yet so I dont know this for a fact, but i'm pretty sure. All and all I would reccomend this game to any fps fan."
3,its a good game but is this all they could make up,"This game was preaty cool. In the game you work for goldfinger and Odd Job versing Dr No. That seemed cool but it didnt fell like the other James Bond games as before. But what made me mad was when I heard you work for Goldfinger I thought you were going to be the villian but no that would make it to fun and thats not what they were going for. Also the graphics suck. But still it was a good game, like you get to use a goldeneye which you can use to fight people. I never beat the game I got stuck on the last level and thats because I have no patience. So if you want to try this game I suggest you rent it."
5,Good Game,"This game will feature modes in story-driven campaign missions, deathmatch style simulator trials, and objective-based war games. It will be featured massivelly online. It has amazing guns to the game. It will take place in Switzerland to the streets of Hong Kong and from Fort Knox to Dr. No's Crab Key lair in the Carribean. The emenies will react intelligently in combat situations and use the environment to their advantage for intense and unpredictable shootouts. So this game will be a good worth franchised game."
3,No James Bond,"In Goldeneye Rogue Agent you get to play the role of a rogue M16 agent who lost his eye in a battle with Dr. No. You now have a gold-colored cybernetic eye and you go out to get revenge.I'm a huge James Bond fan, but I was somewhat disappointed with Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The graphics are above average, but there are a few glitches and the storyline is just plain boring."
2,"Give it up EA,This game is not as good as the original Goldeneye!","The World Is Not Enough=Was OK(I mean the N64 version)007 NightFire=KRAP007 DAD=Worst game EVVAAgent Under Fire=Trash007 Everything Or Nothing=Good game007 From Russia W/Love=OKGoldenEye:Rogue Agent=Trashy and Very TRASHY!Just give RARE back the 007 Licence EA you guys suck at making Bond games most of the Time,You may be good at making other games(BLACK is brilliant,NFS is great,MoH is also good etc,etc,etc) But Bond is not 4U!Peace Out."
2,this isn't Halo!!!!!!,this game is like a copy off halo or some futureistic game. there is no james bond feel at all! there's hardly any missions and weapons. it's like bond turned into crazy assasin. there are no weapons that were from the movie. they're all just made up future stuff. also the bonuses are stupid. like you can see through walls and have an invisible shield!!! also whenever you lose some life you gain it right back in a few seconds. and then there are all the spaceships and crap. DONT BY THIS GAME!!!!
4,Carrying Case,"This is a great case it holds 8 games and+ ,GBC or GB,Fourbatteries,and a Worm light. ...."
1,hate it,"i thought i was getting a workout that was popluar country line dances that i could learn the steps a get great fun exerise and then b able to dance at the club, not so"
4,love it,Definitely a good dance work out. I love line dancing and this helps keep me sharp for our girl's night outs.
2,"it""s o.k.","boring, not like expected. even my daughter looked at me and asked it that was all of it. oh well"
2,Over 75 years of age,"Much better, in my opinion, for younger folks.I'd like to be able to slow it down a bit."
5,Fun quick workout!,I was surprised by how much I've really enjoyed doing this workout! I really didn't expect to break a sweat doing this but I was wrong. I think it would be very difficult if not impossible to keep up without viewing the step guide first. I did the step guide about three times before I attempted to do the workout.
1,Don't buy it!!,"If you like country music this is not the DVD for you. The whole routine is very boring. The music is not country music that I ever heard before. It was a total waste of my money, so save yours."
1,dance off the inches,"This is not at all what I had hoped for. I thought it was going to be real line dances with popular songs. Some of the moves she shows are good, but the intensity is just not there. I have only gone through the whole DVD once. I was not at all impressed. Save your money."
4,Country Dancing,"Thank you for your prompt service. I was received in great shape, would purchase from this vendor again."
2,Dance off the Inches: Country Line dance,A faulty disc? No step guide would come up. If you want to lose lbs with it use it many times a day.
3,low impact workout,"This work out is definately a low impact workout. The music is upbeat and only instrumental. The dance steps are easy to learn and fun to dance. I would have prefered music i was familiar with, since dancing country is usually to your favorite country songs. I have been working out at home with other, more high impact DVD's for over a year now, so this one seemed to be a bit too slow for me. I did break a sweat, but a small one. If you are a beginner to working out at home this may be a good place for you to start. I will use this on days when I don't have a lot of energy, but still desire to exercise."
2,not very good,"This dvd is more of an ""exercise"" lesson than a dance lesson. Yes they are dancing - but not a dance you will see anywhere else and not to country music you will hear again. I would have preferred real line dances and real country music. If you are NOT a country western fan then maybe it's ok because you won't know the difference."
1,Go to the other listing,"There you will find my unbiased honest review of this less than adeequate recording.How can folks really give this even 3 stars after they hear Martinon???Now really, where's the sense of honesty among classicphiles.Honesty something very rare now a days."
1,Where is the CD-ROM for this book????,"Dynamic Modeling, 2nd editionBruce Hannon and Mathias RuthISBN 0-387-98868-8I bought one copy of this book and quickly saw that there was no CD-ROM anywhere in the book. I returned the book for another copy . . . same problem.Now, how could Springer-Verlag release a book, that claims in many places therein, that does not include the CD-ROM.One problem might be that the book with the above ISBN does not seem to be available at Springer Verlag. Check out[...]Here is the current info from SV on a book of with title, publication date and authors:Modeling Dynamic SystemsHannon, Bruce, Ruth, Matthias 2001, ISBN 978-0-387-98868-9, HardcoverI have submitted a CD-ROM help request with SV-Support:[...]Here is hoping for the best!"
3,Collection of poses,"This is a fine compendium of yoga poses, modified with props, for inflexible people, as it states. The poses are arranged in groups for different aims (i.e. ""revitalizing,"" ""quieting,"" etc.) You can mix and match, or go from one pose to the next in a set. But it isn't a routine or a practice, with a rationale and flow from one pose to the next. You are basically constantly interrupted by the DVD to change your pose, employ a prop, etc. I would really appreciate an actual practice composed of poses for inflexible people, so I can really do a daily routine and build on it."
3,Instructional Yoga DVD,"This DVD is very instructional and gives great tips for posture, props and correct positioning. Each pose is treated individually and prompted with a name page and then an instructor showing and giving direction. There is no music and this is not a vinyasa flow DVD. I prefer those that lead you through a flowing practice from start to finish. This would be very good for a beginner who wishes to learn the correct technique of each pose and how to avoid injuring yourself."
3,Too stiff,"This is a good dvd: production quality is adequate, narration is good, pace is good, verbal instructions are good. What it lacks is providing context for why are people inflexible and how will this yoga approach help. I wanted a little education, and there isn't any. I like Rodney Yee's yoga dvds likeA.M. Yoga for Your Weekwhich have high production quality and keep me entertained/interested more during short (20 min) practice session. In this video, the routines are longer, which is not what I can use. I have done yoga with a teacher or alone on and off for 15 years."
2,Good but not for people new to yoga,"I have never done yoga before. Based off of others reviews and the description of this product, I thought it would be a good place to start. I was wrong. I know nothing about poses and stance. This video explains the poses for someone who already knows how to do them. If brand new to yoga do not pick this one to start."
4,It delivers on its promises!,"This DVD really delivers what it promises. I'm notoriously inflexible, and since I sit a at desk all the time, my joints and muscles tend to be very stiff. This DVD is a great complement to a regular workout program. I combine physical movement in a workout and the relaxation/stretching exercises in this DVD to manage physical pain and maintain flexibility to avoid injury. I deducted one star because their presentation is a bit flat and impersonal but you'll get a lot out of it if you just look past these cosmetic drawbacks."
4,"Great information, boring presentation","The information in this dvd is fantastic. Very infrequently do you find an instructor, let alone a video that describes what needs to be done to practice a position or asana with such care. And the combination of workouts is virtually limitless. However, there is no ""rapor"" built with the instructor as there is in say a Lilias or even a Jennifer Kries video. So my interest during the workouts started wandering."
4,good attention to detail but...,"so boring! It is hard enough for inflexible people to get down on the floor to do yoga why bore them silly in the process? I am a dance trainer and am always looking for new flexibility ""tricks""for my more iinflexible students. I did learn a few things here(which is why I gave an extra star) but I think there are more enjoyable ways to increase one's flexibility.For fast results and a more fun workout I would recommend any of Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs DVDs over this one. Their Ultimate Stretch Workout or Beginners and Beyond are great for those who are stiff as a board and would like to see some quick progress."
1,Did not receive a refund.,I ordered a Yoga CD. The CD did not work on my computer or CD player. I returned it with the UPS label provided by Amazon. It has been a month and a half and I still have not received a credit.
2,"It is ok, but could be better","This DVD is good in that you can choose the section you wish to do, but my overall impression is that it is boring and mechanical. Unlike some other productions that are done amid beautiful locations, this is done in a studio and is very dull."
2,"Needs better production, but very beginner-based","I'm an absolute yoga beginner, and the beginner section of this DVD is perfect for someone like me, if they're bedridden maybe. I'm overweight and out of shape, but I found the poses in the beginning module to be pretty simple. I kept feeling like I was lying there doing nothing. It's all basic stretching, stretching, stretching. I had high hopes for this since it's got such good ratings, but I can't recommend it.The production quality is low, with a voiceover. The lighting isn't the best, and the model who demonstrates the poses looks bored. I mean no offense to her appearance, but more in how she's presenting herself. She looks like she just rolled out of bed. She doesn't look rejuvenated or relaxed, and I guess I expect a smile now and then from my instructors. I was disappointed in this, even though there's plenty of poses (something like 35). Save your money and look for something else."
3,inflexible presentation,"Abit too slow. Has too many props.The presenter is abit dull, didn't give me a lot of motivation to carry on with it...I had better... (like crunch`s fat burning yoga...)."
3,Was Not That Impressed,"After reading reviews on this DVD, I decided to go ahead and buy it. I wish now that I would not have bought it. In my opinion, this is not a very good yoga DVD. I favor Baron Baptiste and his style, so maybe this is why I do not like this DVD, but I did not like the positions and the instructions."
5,A flexible DVD for the inflexible,"I received this as a birthday gift and I couldn't be happier. Finding the time to fit in exercise is hard. Finding a exercise dvd that works for me was even harder. This DVD makes it easy with its variable length programs and variety of workouts. While the progression is very slow and the quality is not the best, it still sets the bar for format, hopefully other future exercise dvd's will follow this new technology. When I achieve a degree of flexibility, I look forward to trying out ""Yoga for Everybody"", and ""Pilates Complete for Everybody""."
3,Slightly annoying and choppy,"This DVD concentrates on technique, rather than on the meditative experience of yoga. While the routines are great at describing how exactly you are supposed to do each pose, I found the presentation to be choppy. I would prefer to have one posture flow into another, with a soft guiding voice. The voiceover here is grating to my ears after a while, and I find myself thinking ""would you please shut up"", which is not the feeling with which I want to be practicing yoga! While there are a lot of routines to pick from, again, I would prefer several all-inclusive routines, rather than this variety of body parts to focus on. If you would like yoga to help you connect with your body and spirit, rather than just be a physical exercise, check out the Kripalu Yoga series."
1,the worst ... title misleading,"very little discussion...very little explanation...to get anything out of it you would have had to be experienced at yoga...no modified positions for those of us who are inflexible....Thank goodness, my daughter came over and saw me trying to follow along....she saved yoga for me ...she is now and instructor"
2,Too much time on instruction,"I was excited that this DVD has 35 different yoga exercise sessions, based on what body part you want to work, lower back, upper body ect. BUT I fastly lost interest when each exercise took 30 seconds to explain how to position your body, feet ect. I am all for slowing down but it took way, way, way too long to explain. I am disappointed in how slow the instructor talks and explains."
1,Not for beginners,"As I am pretty inflexible, I thought this might be a good choice as a beginner but, it was not. They used terms that I was unfamiliar with e.g. open your chest and something about your shoulders that I had no idea what they were talking about. Thankfully, it was only $7.99 as I won't be using it."
1,HORRIBLE!,I bought this because I'm overweight and my joints hurt. I was told yoga is great to increase flexibility and helps you loose weight. So I put this in expecting a gradual introduction to yoga. Instead I do three breathing exercises then go into the tree pose. If you know what that is you know someone over weight with joint issues would not start with this pose. It's horrible. My duaghter who also loves yoga and taichi hates it as much as I do we've dropped it off at the thrift store. Save your money and look for something else.
2,Inflexible???,"There is no introduction, and the routines I tried to follow offered no alternatives for those who might not find them easy to do. In other words, if you are truly inflexible I have no idea how this DVD could help you. This DVD might be useful for an average person with no limitations who just wants to be able to choose routines."
4,Great for beginners.,Very good video. Explains movements so you can understand. Good for beginers and more advanced.
4,Very Impressed! recommend it to any beginner.,"This was my first ever Yoga dvd purchase and I am very happy with it. Although some routines have same Poses but Overall, a great product. I have already started doing the morning and night routines and i feel relaxed after doing the poses. The chair exercises are my favorite because even you are not very flexible you can still do them like the lady doing the poses and it makes me satisfied. Enjoy ! remember dont push your self too hard, i did it the first day and it made me all sore. I have been doing it very patiently and seeing progress. Have fun"
3,Long pauses with no flow,"While the explainations for each of the poses is excellent, the video is very disjointed with long pauses between exercises and no flow at all to the series. You're up and down from standing, to sitting, to standing to lying with no logical progression. I enjoyed the series by Rodney Yee much more, as the practice flows like a regular yoga class. This video would be good for people who want to learn the poses, but once you have, you'll find the pace much too slow and choppy."
5,Yoga For Inflexible People,"This has a variety of execises broken down into catagories to work with. The teacher takes care to make the poses accessible to be able to do them if you have flexibility issues, lower ranges of motion or are somewhat a beginner to yoga. All in all it has helped me alot."
5,Good Teacher,This is the first DVD I got when starting out and added others.Very good to start yoga without hurting yourself.
2,Produced by a lawyer,"I cannot use this video! Each pose is introduced by a two-minute (I timed it!) disclaimer! Not the disc, but each pose!I don't understand why they produced a tape, obviously dictated by their attorneys."
1,Dull and off putting for beginners,"I actually purchased this video to ease my less than flexible boyfriend into yoga. Unfortunately, this DVD was so dull that its sorta soured his experience with the whole thing.The DVD creator's idea of ""yoga for inflexible"" people is comprised of a whole lot of standing around with outstretched arms and legs. Not even joking. Yes, this DVD is targeted for inflexible people - but I think that she could have challenged them with a little more than that. If you are looking for yoga for beginner inflexible people - please look elsewhere. In fact, if you do come across a good source, please let me know because I'm still on the search for a good DVD to introduce him to the world of yoga without putting him to sleep."
2,Yoga For Inflexible People,I am new to this form of exercise. I didn't find it very easy to follow. I actually bought 2 and and the other DVD was much more easy to follow...this had too many parts to it for a newcomer in my opinion.
2,too difficult,"The CD works fine, the title is very misleading. Does the woman on the front look ""Inflexible?"" Would not pass this on using this title"
2,disappointed,i probabaly shouldnt write this until i give it a second try but my first impression didnt go over too well. i found it tooo slow and i am qualified for less than yoga 101. it seemed bland and uninspiring ...but i own it soo i will give it another chance if i change my mind i will come back and re-star it.
1,Worthless,"For the beginner, like me, this video is absolutely worthless. You can't even perceive if the model is moving any muscle at all. Instructions go so fast that before catching what's going on, a new instruction comes and you don't understand a thing, let alone trying to mimic the model (which seems static).I gave two more copies to family and a friend, and they are not so definite about this but probably because I gave it to them.Maybe not beginners might see it different."
2,Misleading Title & Description,"As a beginner DVD, the instruction is very thorough. Perhaps a little too much- would be tough for a beginner to visualize a lot of the details of the poses.I bought this DVD for my husband who is afraid to try yoga as he has problems with his knees and flexibility. The poses in this DVD are no different than any others and do not accommodate inflexible people.And, just a minor annoyance: the woman that they use for a lot of the poses is so muscle-bound and unsteady, it's almost painful to observe her."
2,Disappointed,I bought this DVD for my boyfriend who wants to do yoga with me but is not as flexible as I am. I also purchased it because of the high rating it received and the fact that it was given a positive review by Yoga Journal. I was really disappointed with the production quality and the sequencing of of this DVD. It's hard to focus on getting the pose right when the the description the voice is giving doesn't match the picture on the screen. I ended up listening to the instructor and ignoring the picture on the screen.I DO like the fact that they show you different angles of the pose so you can see the shape that you are working towards.I will keep the DVD for reference purposes only when I have questions about poses. I like the Yoga Zone Series much better. They have a nice flowing series of 20 and 30 minute sessions that I can easily fit into my busy schedule.
2,Not flexible enough,"The woman giving the instruction is unattractive and expressionless and her background is also not attractive or interesting. The background sound is not conducive to meditation. The directions include things like ""spread your ribs"" and ""relax your throat"" with any further explanation or direction on how to do this. Some of the movements (child's pose, for instance) require sitting on your heels, not something an inflexible person (or one with bad knees) is able to do. The workout doesn't flow, but has abrupt stops and starts. The seated general workout I is not improved in general seated workout II, some moves are just repeated. In general, I think the poses are not presented in the best order, or an order that would encourage continuous improvement."
1,VERY SLOW,"I found this DVD very slow but informtive, I believe its for beginners who are not flexible at all or have never ever attended a yoga class."
1,Painfully boaring. I want my money back.,"If this DVD were my first experience with Yoga, it would likely be my last. Thank goodness it is not. Boaring, boaring, boaring. I want my money back."
1,Yoga for Inflexable People,"This looks like it would be a good beginning dvd, but the copy I got goes blank one minute into every routine. I tryied to return it for replacement but the company that made it seems to be out of business. Amazon's return policy on defective dvd's is very disappointing. Buy this dvd with caution -- it may not work."
4,Very good tape for 56 year old.,this tape has very good for deep stretching and even breaks them into specific areas that may be a concern.
1,THIS is for inflexible people?!,"This isn't really a very good item for beginners OR for those who are inflexible! The person doing the poses is hyperextending her knee on several poses (which will aggravate any joint pain!), and ""helpful"" instructions like ""spread your ribs outward laterally"" or ""move the backs of your thighs outward and move your tailbone down into that space"" or ""experience your breath"" not only make no sense, but trying to figure out what the heck she means takes you out of any relaxation you've achieved. We bought this to replace our VHS copy of ""Basic Yoga for Dummies"", but we're throwing this out and buying Dummies on DVD instead."
3,Lacks flow,"For the most part, positions feel too isolated in this DVD. I wish it felt more like a yoga class, with positions flowing from one to the next to create a routine. I don't like the screen going black between positions. You'll perform one position standing, the screen goes black, and then you're sitting, without having gotten there by means of a position like forward fold. I would have preferred routines which stretch my whole body in one routine and don't really like the focus on individual body parts for an hour. I would also have preferred routines which move you from standing to seated and back, instead of focusing on one or the other. Some of the positions are shown opposite of the narration - when the narrator tells you to bend your right leg, the demonstrator bends her left, which is somewhat confusing. I do like the option for shorter or longer routines, depending on how much time I have."
5,Pure poetry!,"This book is pure poetry and soul!I cannot choose a favorite image, because so many are simply amazing!It moves you!To me a real photography book should generate emotions, and Nick Brandt does that very well!This book has a unique style, black and white (or better, greys), with some peculiar effects, but to me, that just enhanced the magic.Anyone who loves animals will appreciate this work of a true artist.I totally recommend it."
4,A beautiful work...,"This books contains a number of beautifully printed black and white photographs shot in East Africa. The images highlight the rich flora and fauna of the region, focusing on those animals one would expect to see on a typical African safari: zebra, lions, giraffes, elephants, primates, ostrich, rhinoceroses, and more. This book would make a nice addition to any collection."
2,dissapointed,"I just bought the Artist's Edition of On This Earth, A Shadow Falls from one of the galleries that represent Nick Brandt. It's a huge beautiful, stunningly printed book that combines the best photos from his two books. I now look at my old copy of On This Earth, and realize just how badly reproduced, how poorly printed, the photos are in it. Having seen Nick Brandt's giant prints in exhibitions, the Artist's Edition really does a great job of capturing their essence. This book, On this Earth, does not. So I highly recommend that everyone try and find the money to buy the Artist's Edition of On This Earth, A Shadow Falls instead. It costs about $125 (you can only get it from the galleries), but given its giant size, the number of photos in it from both books, and the fact that it's signed by the artist, is something of a bargain. Many of the photos in On This Earth are great but, because they are so badly printed and small, I am compelled to give this book only two stars."
2,Brandt's newer books are better...,"I now own all three of Nick Brandt's books. I purchased them in order from newest to oldest, and I have to say that his first book, On This Earth, doesn't stand up to the rest. It's badly printed, muddy and smaller than the others. A Shadow Falls (2nd book) is better...bigger, better printed and better photos. The best - hands down - is the latest...On This Earth, A Shadow Falls. It's a signed edition that has the best photos from both of the aforementioned...and they look great."
2,Print Quality Leaves A Lot To Be Desired,"The photos are absolutely stunning, of that there is no doubt. But, sadly, the prints in this book do not come close to the fidelity of even those displayed on Nick Brandt's web site."
4,just great,"This artist is just amazing, since I saw his exhibition, I never forgot the intensity of these original masterpiece. So why only 4 stars?? I don't know, the book is too small? The printing? it's never perfect but the photographs... The photographs ..."
4,Great for dry skin,"In the winter, I get patches of dry skin. I use this as overnight cream and it works better than anything else and doesn't feel heavy or greasy. Also, somehow it makes my skin look more even and glowy."
3,obselete,"I did research before making this purchase and this lantern gets good reviews. However, once I received the lantern, I found that there was no longer fuel (Powermax) available for it. I checked camping stores all over San Diego and then I wrote to Coleman. Coleman told me I should return the lantern to the seller !"
4,Got this as a book safe!,"I received this book as a book safe and started to read it. So, good I had to purchase the book to see how the story played out. Good book. Page turner!"
3,A Roadmap of the War,"For anyone looking for a narrative account of the war, you should look elsewhere. This book has a brief summary of the war in the first 1/4 to 1/3 of the book and the remainder is mostly a description of where historical markers are placed, what they say and whether they are in the right spot. At the end is a couple pages of diary which was also interesting but because I don't care about retracing the steps of the war, I found this book less than satisfactory. If, however, you want to retrace the steps - this is probably the definitive source.I am torn as for the rating because I feel like it is a very good, well-researched book for a certain audience, but for me, or anyone expecting a narrative about the war, it is quite disappointing. As such, I will rate it a 3."
2,Readers Beware,"If you're an amateur historian that prefers a logical sequential order to your reading, then don't buy this one. It's more like a scrapbook, or collage than a step-by-step history. I suppose if you've already done a little reading on this subject, and you simply want a reference book to put on your shelf, then this may be the buy. Otherwise, there's got to be some much better choices."
3,Detailed Portrayal of Early America,"I had high hopes for this book, and some were fulfilled.It has some very interesting historical background of King Philip's War and good first hand accounts.The detailed descriptions of the locales, however, were very long, sometimes overly so. And as someone who is not from New England, these passages grew tedious at times, and even nit-picky about some war-related minutiae.However, the subject matter in general was interesting to me, and the writing was done well.The book is really more designed for the professional archaeologist/historian than the casual history reader. But it does have a wealth of information on obscure 17th century New England. If you think you can slog through the denser parts, then I would recommend this book for those interested in American colonial history."
4,Very Helpful.,"I would say that if a person really wanted to understand King Philip's War without spending decades studying it, this is a good book to read along with Leach's ""Flintlock and Tomahawk"" and LePore's ""The Name of War.""Fantastic maps! Very helpful in getting a good picture of the battles."
1,Shoddy customer support,"Worked great for about a week, then went down, box says tech support available 24/7, but toll-free number doesn't accept calls from my area (AZ)! Downloads on website don't work either. Very disappointed..."
2,Won't shut off.,Needs a switch. No fun if they keep popping up! Had to remove batteries to turn it off.
5,Don't Miss This,Wonderful music and and an excellent mix of instruments. Something I can play over and over. I get a lift from it immediatley.
1,Misleading info,The information provided on the website does not match the desk. The desk is totally useless to me because of the erroneous information.
2,Didn't spark my interest,"If you happen to have a copy of the out of print book LIGHT ON C.S. LEWIS, you have basically all the comments that Lawlor has to give about his memories of the man. As for the commentary Lawlor gives on Lewis's books, I found it uneven. Unlike the lucid Lewis, Lawlor's sentences are often murky and their meanings difficult to understand. His commentaries on Lewis's books didn't really enlighten anything. I have been an avid reader of Lewis for a long time, and this is the first time I bought a book about Lewis in which I returned to the bookstore for a refund when I was finished."
2,Just a few hours of play,"The seams are well sewn and did not come apart. However, the sound chip inside broke within just a few hours of playing with it. You can hear the plastic parts crunching and it doesn't quack any longer. Although the toy has stayed together (except for the sound chip) I still had to throw it out, for fear some of those crunching plastic parts inside would poke through. Very disappointing (and expensive) for just a few hours of play."
1,DANGEROUS TOY - DO NOT BUY - YOUR DOG COULD DIE,My dog just chewed through this toy tonight and i found 3 watch-like batteries came out of it. I don't know if she possibly ate one or more. She could need surgery if she did. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! Very irresponsible!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this olive oil after reading a rave review in Cooks Magazine. We did a blind taste test the next evening--Nunez de Prado vs. Pompeiian extra-virgin off the grocery shelf--and found no appreciable edge either way. For high-priced stuff, the N. de P. strikes us as pale in color & short on flavor. (The only benefit of the doubt I can give it was that it did sit in freezing weather on our doorstep for a few hours until I got home from work, though I haven't heard of that harming olive oil.)"
5,Phineas,"Grandson will love this one. He's a true Phineas and Ferb follower.Great price, only found it here. Can't wait for him to see this one."
1,Not the Best,"I understand that many people enjoy watching ""Phineas and Ferb,"" and perhaps you or someone that you know and are close to may enjoy it, too. That is perfectly fine by me. You are entitled to your opinion, and if you like to watch ""Phineas and Ferb,"" that is fine. However, I just do not like it. It is a very predictable cartoon, and once the episode has been carried on long enough to reveal the crucial points (such as Phineas and Ferb's plan for the day or Dr. Doofenschmirtz's plan for the day) it is easy to guess what is going to happen after that. The humor is often plain and dull, too. I mean, this series definitely has heart; the characters love each other without being cheesy about it. The episodes are just boring and repetitive in my opinion."
5,Phineas and Ferb are great!,"My girls (ages 7 and 9) love Phineas and Ferb. We don't watch a lot of TV and I'm pretty picky, but this show is intelligent and fun."
1,ptu: police Tactical Unit,"i Cant Say That I Hate The Movie For They Did Not Send Me The Right Movie That I Paid For They Sent e A childrens Movie Called ( KIPPER PLAYTIME FROM THE HIT TELEVISION SERIES ) I'm Really Dissapointed Please Can You Send Me The Right Movie. The Correct Movie Was Suppose To Be ( Dragon Dynasty: P.T.U.: Police Tactical Unit ) A Martial Arts Movie. Sincerly, Mr. Stone //////////// I received your message sorry the message was an earlyer message but i have not received the correct movie yet must still be in transit so please disregard the message i will write back again when i receive it thanks again for replacing the movie cant wait to get it, really looking forward to it. sincerly mr. stone"
3,Somewhat Boring,"This movie seemed a little on the boring side with a surprise ending worthy of a giggle. More of a drama than an action movie and even then its hard to pin a genre in relation to this movie. This is in no way a martial arts film. Got a great price on it and expanded upon my Chinese film collection, overall I am satisfied. Was expecting a little more out of this movie though. Oh well... better than most crap in America."
1,"A Dissapointing, Boring, Mess","I have been an avid fan of Asian Cinema for the past 10 years or so and I have collected literally hundreds of movies ranging from martial arts, to war, to cops/crime movies. P.T.U. may be the worst I've seen. I watched Exiled a couple of months ago and while that was slow moving it was very interesting and sylish. PTU is a complete wast of time. It is BORING in that worst way---I couldn't care less about the characters...any of them. Don't waste your time on this one....get City of Violence, Kill Zone or a Region free copy of 'The Warlords'. Anything but this terrible film."
2,yawn,"A slow-moving, confusing drama with something of a sort of payoff at the end. Don't believe the cover blurbs."
3,Barrel-chested Sandtrooper,"I remember when this guy first came out. It was pretty good for the times. However, even then, there were two big problems. First, he has a bulging barrel-chest, quite unlike what Sandtroopers looked like in the movies. This was when Hasbro thought all Star Wars figures had to look ""heroic."" Second, he could only hold his gun pointing at a 45 degree angle with two hands. This didn't work if you wanted to set up a diorama with several Sandtroopers talking. Hasbro has since released other Sandtroopers, but as far as I know this is still the only one with the orange shoulder pad."
1,"When you try to sell yourself as ""Hip"", you aren't","A deceptive little book. First you think the designs are by these ""hip"" young knitters. Maybe not. The more I read, the more it appeared they inspired them - the actual design work was Chin's. I find the ambiguity bothersome because I beleive the intention was for the reader to credit our ""HYUKs""(geez, I hate cutsie acronyms!) as the designers.Now that I think about it, my opinion probably is worthless since I'm now just north of 40 - evidently never to be relevant or ""hip"" again."
2,urban not hip,"I ordered this book cause it sounded forward thinking in its approach and inspirational...But i was a bit disappointed. Yes, it was interesting to read about the knitters involved but the whole tone was slightly shallow and pretentious. The designs were quite dull in their shapes and colours too. In fact it was either pedestrian stuff that you could find in any housewives magazine that happens to trow in a couple of knitting patterns (hat, gloves, scarf, cardigan) or impractical things like capelet (?) and shoes.... the yarns looked cheap and nasty....all that shiny fluffy stuff made me feel itchy just looking at it .Nothing in there i wanted to knit or wear. Nothing that sparked my enthusiasm in knitting."
1,She Stoops To Conquer?,"I wish Lily had simply pulled together all her marvelously challenging technical knitting columns with a few new designs and called it a book! Any one of her magazine columns or any one already published flattering and clever design is worth more than this entire book. I thought perhaps it was because I am half again as old as Lily that none of the designs spoke to me in the slightest. I am a painstaking knitter of socks and also doll clothes, and I lived in San Francisco until recently. I realize the world is full of (other) happy successful people who happen to knit. Many of them are young and rail thin with plenty of spending money and love to knit a colorful lumpy pullover in a weekend. I love 'em and I love Lily, but ten minutes with this book convinced me to save my money. I am going to spring for the Sweaters from Camp book and the Twisted Sisters sock book."
3,"Enjoyed it, but.......","I bought the book since I am 28 and an urban knitter. But I found that although I enjoyed reading about how each featured knitter got into knitting and the thinking behind their designs, well, gosh darn it, I just didn't ""feel"" it with this book! I would recommend this book to someone that enjoys reading about knitting, but definitely not as a pattern book. I think they just threw in the patterns simply because it is a book dealing with knitters.However, I love the pattern for the sandals and will give those a try. And maybe that halter top....."
2,Liked the profiles but not the patterns,"I am fairly experienced at knitting and live in Chicago. I found the approach of featuring different women and their patterns engaging but the patterns didn't seem urban and chic to me. I don't forsee making any of them, so the book hasn't been of much use."
2,She has missed the mark on this one.,"I like Chin's patterns in Knitter's Magazine and received this book as a present. It was very difficult to get into because the projects are more about being young, hip and urban. I guess she's trying to sell the craft of knitting to a younger generation but the book misses the mark. If you are looking for a pattern book with challenging and attractive knitting patterns, look somewhere else."
2,Underwhelming,"I bought this book for $3.99 at a closeout discount store. I'm glad I didn't pay more than that. Lily Chin is a ""genius knitter"" in my opinion. So why didn't her editor do a better job making a visually pleasing book? The pages are flat cardstock, and there are no pictures of the projects modeled by people. In addition, Lily's egotism really becomes apparent as one reads the text, which is not appealing to the average reader."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this book hoping to find some interesting designs for the under 30 (and just barely 30) set and what I found were bland, blah and unbelieveable (I won't be knitting myself a bra anytime soon). Not very useful."
1,Not Lily Chin's Best Work,This collection of knitting designs is not up to Lily Chin's other designs. There was not one item in the book that interested me or had a creative flair. Boring at best.
2,A bit dissappointing,"I was a little disappointed. I thought there would be more designs from the author, but instead most of the patterns are from individuals around the country. There are 2 patterns in the book of any interest to me, and I still haven't made them and probably will not. Better to save your money and view individual's work on knitting blogs."
1,Dropped Stitches,"I'm a big fan of Lily's trendy, cool, witty designs that have been showcased in Knitter's and other publications, and assumed this would be a collection of her designs. Whoops... shoulda read the reader reviews! I didn't realize this was a compendium of drab, amateurish, lumpy-looking items designed by non-professionals, and aimed at those just getting into knitting. Some of the ideas, like the bra top and the shoes, were almost a tiny bit cute-ish (is this called damning with faint praise?)- but I wouldn't be bothered taking the time to make any of them.While I like the idea of showcasing atypical, young and ultra-trendy knitters, this wasn't my dream book. However, I would welcome a book of Lily's own creations."
2,Urban? Where???,"While I enjoyed the profiles of the various knitters, the patterns themselves (why else should you buy the book??) were pretty bland. Some of them were boxy and 80s, not exactly current, and some of the more interesting patterns looked very difficult to successfully pull off, like the dress. Nothing was particulary current or stylishly classic, most of it just looked unflattering to the wearer. And the photos are in the center of the book, not next to their patterns (annoying to have to flip back and forth) and none of the clothes are shown on human models, they are all just laying flat. Maybe because they don't look so good on people??? I was very disappointed."
4,Definitely worth getting at this low price!,"While I certainly did see a few patterns in this book that I wouldn't be caught dead knitting, I personally have never seen a pattern book in which every pattern was worth my time. For me, the novel ideas - such as the bras, shoes, halter, dress - are what made me want to purchase this book and I'm not at all disappointed with them. I also love all the small 'gift' projects, stylish patterns for scarves, purses, pillows, socks that are great to have on hand in a gift-giving emergency. While my definition of hip and urban apparently differ from Lily Chin's (I'm 23 and more into the mild side of couture - most of this was a bit tamer than I was expecting), the good percentage of unique items in this book that I will be knitting up definitely make this book worth the cost."
2,Can't bond with it,"I like knitting books I can feel at home with and comfortable with. This is not one of those. I could never get enthused about any of the patterns. I did make the baby blanket, but I hate buying a book and only using one pattern. The idea may have been a good one, but it didn't deliver."
2,Contemporary designs for the 1950s perhaps,"I received this book as a gift and am only too glad that I can return it for a differnt title. Out of the 20 designs in this books, all but a few accesories are dated and boring. If nothing else make sure you take a look at a copy of this book before you buy it."
2,"Lovely,but",Very pretty ring but stone fell.out three days after getting it other than that the ring was very lovely wish I could get another one but scare it will happen again
2,"Looks nice, but turned brown","I like this item for about a month. Then it started to tarnish on the silver. I used silver cleaner and a few other products, but I couldn't get it cleaned. I ended up tossing it. Glad I didn't pay that much for it."
3,pink ring,"It was a pretty ring, but it turned colors on my granddaughters finger. ???The ring itself turned black on the back side, so I wouldn't recommend this ring."
3,Not impressed,"I bought this ring for myself, I wasn't expecting anything glamorous but i was expecting something better. the stone looks like cheap plastic and was loose when it arrived and fell out a week later. the metal is thin and chips easily. i was not impressed with this ring at all. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over seven years old."
2,Okay,this series is one that you can skip. the first few books are INTERESTING... but then they get stranger and stranger and they don't make sense anymore... well they never did... when you get to the 5 or 6 book it gets cheezy and you gag XP so skip unless you want bad cheezy manga.
5,This book is a gold mine!,"Wow. This is a very, very good book. I really did not expect to find a book with this level of technical detail for such a low price. The section on turbochargers was great! It did a fantastic job of covering all of the fundamentals, without using so much technical jargon that it is over the head of most readers.The 'secret peaks' into some of the world's fastest all-motor Honda engines was also facinating. Even if you don't have a Honda, there is a lot of good, basic, sound engine performance information. If you are planning to modify a B-series or D-series Honda motor, you have to have this book!"
2,Ive read better Honda books than this one,I ordered this book and the High Performance Honda Builders Handbook Volume 1 and I highly recommend that book rather than this. Poorly written book but it does have the basics in it. And yes I returned this book back for a refund.
5,fascinating!,"As soon as I started reading this book i could not stop. The detail of how my motor actually works amazes me. I am excited to learn about the many possibilities of making my car a ""rocket""."
1,Sloppy Editing,"I picked up this book several months ago, and have just tossed it into the recycle bin after weeks of complaining, and having people cross check my answers.I don't like to use the answer key for cheating, but do always check my solution. I like to do a puzzle or two each day, and after several weeks have just grown too frustrated with the sloppy editing of this book. Several of the puzzles have typos. Several of the puzzles had incorrect answers in the back. There is too much frustration in working a puzzle that is poorly written, when you check the answer in the back only to discover that you could never have come up with it because of a typo."
5,"A readable, useable, technical guide.","Sparrows. Yippee. But if you want to learn them, this is the book.Lots of detail, as you'd expect, but very clearly presented. Terrific illustrations and range maps. And what I like, but some will hate, is the fairly detailed treatment of every field-identifiable subspecies. Some of these subspecies will become full species some day, if present trends continue, and you'll be way ahead of the game if you've already been working on telling them apart. Plus it's fun; just try to keep an open mind."
2,Disappointing !,I used this book to prepare for my NT workstaion 4.0 and I barely got through. The book was good but I felt it did'nt focus properly on an exam point of view. Some topics like sysdiff utility were not covered. The sample questions could have been modelled like Microsoft exams. Not worth spending so much money on this book.
2,Too many innacuracies and omissions,"When you get to your Microsoft exam and there are 6 questions on sysdiff, you will wonder why you paid so much this book, because it's not even mentioned. As you take the practice tests you'll also wonder why there are no explinations to the answers. Hopefully you'll figure out that it's because most of the answers are wrong. Someone pointed out that the practice questions in this book are harder than the actual exam, that's because on the microsoft exam, the correct answer makes sense. Unlike this bookEven simple things like the hardware requirements for installing NT are all wrong.If I hadn't ripped open the CD, I'd definately bring this one back. Very sloppy work guys."
5,Well written book that will suffice on its own,"This book is better written and organized than the Sybex counterparts with fewer mistakes and more drills. In my opinion, the chapter questions are more difficult than the actual MCSE Workstation 4.0 (70-73) Exam questions themselves. You can probably pass the MCSE exam by studying the material in this book alone. However, I recommend coupling this book with practice exams from Transcender Corporation. This particular combination produced a 980/1000 score on my first MCSE exam, #70-73."
5,"A passionate critique of technology, capitalism and industrial patriarchy!","Without a doubt, Derrick Jensen is one of the most important social critics in North America today. Whether he's discussing deforestation, the death of salmon or violence against women, his words will move you. In ""The Other Side of Darkness"", Jensen guides us on a painful journey past the toxic landfills of our culture to a place of healing and restoration. For anyone willing to look deeply at their own reflection in the dirty rivers of our society, this 3 cd collection is a powerful, transformative experience. I especially recommend buying this collection to share with friends who may not have the time or inclination to read some of Jensen's many incredible books. Listening to Jensen's words in harmony with the voices of trees and mountains and birds may well awaken the listener out of complicity and denial to an awareness of our responsiblity to protect the earth."
1,not this,"Very disappointing. This tedious, long presentation is chock full of endless digressions and broken sentences as Jensen tries to be witty. The effect is more narcissistic than anything else. Few ideas conveyed amist all the pointless jumps, and nothing that has not been covered in his books.He is a far better writer than a speaker. Read his stuff: essential!"
5,Fisheye 35mm Camera,"This is a great, fun camera. Just load the film and shoot. It's easy to use and easy to sneak up on your subject because theirs no focusing and fooling with it. You can use the camera with one hand, including turning the wheel to the next frame. Worth the low price."
5,love,"being an avid photographer with a love of altered photos, i was an instant fan of lomo cameras. the fisheye is the second one i have and i love it amazing!! plus mine is gold!"
1,Fish eye,"I received this camera about a month back, used about three rolls on it. When I developed them they all were exposed except 2 or 3 per roll. It turns out the camera was defective. The shutter would stay open and expose the frames. I sent it back and just received a new one. I have yet to try it but I'm hoping I do not have the same problem or else I will not be purchasing a lomography product again."
2,Not the one I ordered!!,I'm giving this a 2 stars only because my daughter also had this camera onher wish list. If not I would of been upset having recieved the wrong camerathat I ordered..........
4,Buy this!!!!,"This is such a fun camera and I was so happy with the first roll of film I developed. I'll be honest, you have to experiment with the camera in order to get the optimal fisheye shot. It's obviously not as fantastic as a real fisheye lense on a (D)SLR but for $30, it beats having to buy a $800 camera and a $300+ lens. The majority of my college campus is built of bricks so pictures on campus are amazing. I love this camera!"
4,Vibrant and Fun,"I've had this camera for about a year now, having forgotten to review it when I first received it, and I love it. The colors are surprisingly vibrant, more so than I had expected, and the camera has a nice feel to it. Because this is a fisheye camera, I find that I've stopped using the viewfinder. I just point the camera at my intended subject and shoot. Part of the fun is in not know exactly how your picture will turn out, and usually it turns out great.This camera works best in bright, natural lighting. I used it while flying kites with friends and loved the results. Inside, the pictures tend to turn out dark without the flash, or white washed with the flash, as the flash tends to be too strong.This camera isn't perfect, which it the point. You have to expect and embrace the imperfections, otherwise this camera will drive you crazy. But for those looking for something fun and different, I fully recommend the Lomo Fisheye."
3,Fun little Camera,"Great camera for fun little 35mm fisheye shots. Thing is on the first one I had the flash didn't work, but the Lomo folks def came through with support on that. The flash sometimes is blinded by how the lens sticks out form the body and casts a shadow. But good camera for the price!"
3,"It's a fun little camera, but overpriced...","A pleasant little camera that takes good (for a toy camera) quality fisheye shots. The image circle is smaller than a 35mm frame, so be prepared for images that look like they were taken through a toilet paper roll. You'll see the inside of the lens barrel. The build quality is just a hair above a disposable camera, dressed up with some faux leather. It's certainly a good alternative to going out and buying a ""real"" fisheye lens just to screw around, but as you would expect from the Lomographic Society - it's about twice as expensive as it should be."
3,Good for the money,I bought this camera for my daughter. It is strictly for pleasure and works great for the money.
4,Fun and funky little camera,"This camera is pretty fun to play with. I guess I had different expectations for how the the pictures would come out. But once I knew what to expect I had a lot of fun with it! When you get your prints back, the image is in a black circle. And if you're not careful, your feet may end up in the shot because of the lens being so wide! Also I got a few shots with the lens cap dangling in the way. So be mindful of your lens cap and your feet and just go to town!"
1,Unsure,"The flash stopped working, and the pictures did not come out like I thought... Most of each picture is black and then there is a small circle of a picture in the center."
1,"looks like a great camera, but never recieved it.!!!!!","never recieved the camera. did not hear back from the company, Adorama camera.... sent three emails. wheres the camera, where's my money. what crooks!!!!"
5,love is putting it lightly.,"i am so in love with this camera!! it is so incredibly easy to use, just point and shoot! i highly recommend using this camera in sunny outdoor settings, or any place that is very well lit. the flash on the camera is crappy, but i just avoid those bad lighting situations :) the viewfinder is also usless because the lens is so big, but once again you dont really need to use the viewfinder. just point, shoot and have a blast!!!"
4,Quirky Litte Camera,"I was worried about getting this camera based on the reviews that I saw on amazon and when I finally got it, but boy was I wrong. While the Camera looks really cheap for the money you paid for it, it takes some awesomme and weird pictures. I took pictures both outside and inside on a cloudy Chicago day and out of 26, 22 came out perfect, 2 came out dark, and 2 did not come out well. Thats still pretty good since the entire fun of this camera is not knowing what will come out. I think it is a really great little item and, if you like taking some pictures, grab 400 speed 35mm film, the camera, and start shooting. The only downside is you need to manually wind the film in and out of the camera. Has a nice old time feel!"
2,Amateur Bigfoot Investigation,"I can't in all honesty recommend this movie except for those us who are die-hard Bigfoot fans that cannot get enough of the stuff. It looks and feels like a college art project or a home video put together about some friends who got together after watching a few Bigfoot documentaries and decided to make their own. There is nothing new; no new footage, still images, tracks, casts, etc. - but the production techniques were pretty good. Have to give all the crew an A for effort."
1,nothing new,I got this for christmas 05 and what a big disappointment it was. It you follow bigfoot at all do not get this. if new to bigfoot or must have everything bigfoot for collection than go for it
5,Great show!,It's great to see something new on this topic. Too many of these shows just rehash the famous Paterson film. This DVD does a nice job of presenting the new scientific evidence - and the sightings documented are pretty persuasive.
5,The Possibility that Bigfoot Exists...,"This insightful documentary is one that challenges the mind to think outside of the box. Is there a possibilty that an ape-like creature roams the Rocky Mountains? Yes there is and the evidence to support this claim is growing. The film offers evidence such as eyewitness accounts and expert analysis. Moreover, it is entertaining and ends with an interesting and frightening expedition gone right."
5,Better than most,"It's nice to see a Bigfoot show that doesn't rehash the same old territory. This has a lot of info that has not been seen in a documentary before. And nobody has more from Prof. Jeff Meldrum, the top serious scientist of this phenomenon. And I like the ""Gen-X"" feel of this film. Some confused reviewers might see this as amtateurish (probably the same people who think the shakey camera on ""Law and Order"" is a mistake); I liked the fast-action and fun pace."
3,Hiking adventures,"I thought the book was OK....I was looking for some encounters to read about and possibly some behavioural information. After reading the book it fell short of that...this book is mainly about the hike as opposed to any encounters, although he does have one for sure. Some good info from the local agencies as well....I must say though, the author seems to portray himself as a very conciencious traveller of the woods and I respect him for that.All in all a good book if you want to go out and see some nice scenery....and maybe a Sasquatch if your lucky......"
2,"Started out good, but fizzled in the end!","This Video had potential! The 1st half half of the video shows goodevidence plus eye witness accounts. The 2nd half of the video is very amaturish (kind of blair witch style). In the 2nd half theytake you on an expedition with a bunch of college age goofballswho know nothing about bigfoot research! This part of the film sucks! Nothing happens on their outing! Based on the last half of the film, I would reccomend buying it. Take care!"
1,Nothing New,"This DVD was a total waste of time and money. I would really like to see something more definitive on the subject, and more recent. I NEVER thought that I would ever pay to watch a DVD of someones camping trip. I am very well read on this subject, and am always looking for something new and exciting on this subject. Is Sasquatch real? I believe that he is! The evidence, though anecdotal, is compelling. I only gave this DVD one star because I couldn't give it none."
5,excellent book for SAS/macro,I am not very familiar with SAS/Macro. This book show me how touse macro language easily and I really learn a lot from this book. I recommend who does not know the macro language to buythis book. And it contains much more than its prices.Every SAS programmer must have one.
3,For Beginners Only,"It is definitely not for advanced programmers, it is not designed to train you the ability to write your own code entirely as when using C++ or R language.The book basically tells you how to manipulate existing SAS macro functions with the framework of SAS data step. I strongly doubt that a reader who finishes this book would acquire the ability to write a simple code on his own, for example, a code to compute the sum of integers from 1 to 100 under Macro environment.But still, this is not a very bad book for two reasons:1, there are not many books about writing (true) code in SAS;2, the programming under SAS macro is very limited due to its poor design."
3,The Flower's Fragrance Begins To Fade,"I've enjoyed Armik's music since his first recording. His blend of modern flamenco spiced with Greek/Middle Eastern melodies makes him unique among the ""nuevo flamenco"" crowd. However, with this newest release, Armik's wonder fingers are now starting to lose their way. Most of the melodies here are, frankly, rehashed from previous works.For example, Armik's trademark blazing arpeggios on ""Fiesta"" are copied exactly--even in the same key--from his previous song, ""Gypsy Flame"" (though this time with Mexican ranchera rhythms interwoven in the composition). In addition, it is becoming evident that for all Armik's technical prowess, he is somewhat limited in his creativeness (how many songs can one person write in the key of D minor?)If you already own Armik's other recordings, then you really already own this one as well."
1,It is different from armik's other CD's only in one way,This CD is only different from his other CDs by the front painting.The music is the same.It seems that he keeps recording the same music over and over. I am glad I did not buy it.Instead I bought a new CD by Vicente Amigo on AMAZON.COM
3,One of Armik's Lesser Efforts,"There are only three songs from this cd that I like - ""Amor de Guitarra"", ""Fiesta""' and ""Midnight Bolero"". Other than those three songs, none of the others do anything for me. Unless you're really addicted to Armik, this cd isn't worth buying."
3,A very difficult read,This book was one of the tougher presidentail biographies that I have read.Thank God it wasn't too long. At least the book gets better as you read it.I will definitely not read this book again and will probably look for another book on ZT for future reference.
3,"Slow start, but strong finish","Overall, this was a good book about our 12th president, but the first half of it is not all that easy to read, and it may not be all the fault of the author. There apparently is not a lot of personal information known about Taylor, and so much of the early part of the book is all about his work at this fort and then that fort or this battle and then that battle. It kind of all runs together and gets a bit tedious. The book really gets interesting for me when Taylor moves into the political arena. I just wish that part of the book was longer, but, in fairness, the book is a good representation of Taylor's life."
1,Facts and details do not a biography make!,"Sadly, after one slogs through an exhautive accounting of Zachary Taylor's military career presented here, you are neither greatly informed nor satisfactorily influemced about the man himself. Beyond gauging that Taylor was a relatively witless minion bouyed by circumstance into the presidency, one is left empty of opinion as to the depth of his character and definition of his nature. One can know just as little about Taylor without reading this dry and bland text, and enjoy life just a bit more in the not reading."
4,Zachary Taylor - An Unlikely President,"Zachary Taylor was one of the most unlikely men to ever serve as president of the United States. Self-educated, an average and conservative military leader and definitely not an intellectual, he was thrust into the limelight because of his success in the Mexican War. Although a southerner, Taylor opposed the extension of slavery and threatened dire consequences to secessionists. He died unexpectedly after serving only sixteen months as president. His death occurred just as he was reorganizing his administration and attempting a recasting of the Whig party. Mr. Bauer does a good job of describing the effect Zachary Taylor had on the nation as well as who he was as an individual."
2,Bad attempt with limited research,This was a terrible attempt at scholarship. The book is poorly written and gives an overview with no specifics except for military encounters. This author should have focused his efforts on a military account of Taylor's life because after reading I feel I know nothing about the man. Admittedly there are severe source deficiencies when dealing with this subject but a much wider study could have been undertaken. Sadly there is not much written on Taylor and this does a poor job of adding to the scholarship.
3,Good Attempt at a Dry Subject,"This book is a tough one to get through, not through any fault of the Author but due to the dryness of the material. I am currently in the process of reading a book on every US President and this book seemed to be the best one out there on Zachary Taylor.I would recommend if you are trying to find out more about the subject, but if you are looking for a great historical page turner, you need to look elsewhere."
5,Toppermost of the Poppermost,"The first single, ""Alright With Me"" was a revelation, and I think everyone in New Zealand was looking forward expectantly to the release of this first album which, it must be said, followed in leisurely fashion! Anyone who enjoys good honest melodic pop from artists like The Corrs, Jewel or Dido will love this album, definately deserving of international exposure and sales. Four great singles were derived from this album, ""Alright With Me"", ""We Kissed"", ""Love Will Save Me"" and ""This Is It"" - hopefully she hasn't burnt out all her creativity on her first album, as judging by this collection Carly has a great deal of potential. www.carlybinding.com has a couple of 30 second audio samples for you, along with videos."
5,"Great Humor, Funny, Good for the Outhouse!!!","This book is truly a concise repesentation of the life of a Redneck. Grate poetry. And usefull pages at the end of the book. If you ever wondered about the Redneck life, buy this book. Brent is a great storyteller. Also, get his tape called Cow Tunes For Kids."
3,Help me please,Please tell me if this headphones can connect to a video game console like PS3?I want to buy this headphones but I dont know if them can connect to my PS3.Please help me!
3,Good product but lousy software and drivers,"These headphones are a very good quality set. The base response they have is impressive, sound quality is very good and they are comfortable enough to wear for a long period of time. The microphone is also excellent with no problems with clarity.Unfortunately, this company still does not have a good functioning Windows Vista software package for this headset, and doesn't seem to be in a rush to get one released. Functionality in Vista is therefore greatly limited, and the driver is very annoying - you have to reboot Windows to change from speakers to headphone or vice-versa.I would not recommend this product to anyone until new proper drivers and software are released, and then I would probably give it a 5 star."
5,"Sounds great, works great for me.","I noticed some other reviews that had issue, but I've not experienced any of those with this headset, and I've used it with with a few different PC's and even a Mac. Maybe Tritton came out with a new driver, or an updated version of this headset...who knows...all I know is that mine rocks. It's Comfortable, with really clean and full sound. Really nice high, mids and lows. Even though I don't use the mic very often, it works well, and people say they can hear me clearly. The four speakers in each ear cup do a great job of sound separation. I'm able to hear things in all different directions...and sounds that I never noticed in these games before. It nice to be able to hear where the the enemy is before I see him, and more importantly before he sees me. Also, all the cool ambient noises, like birds, wind, rain etc...are much easier to hear with this headset and all these directional sounds just add to the gaming experience. Pretty amazing."
2,Poor Vista Performance,I wish I would have seen these reviews BEFORE I bought this headset. It is of very high quality manufacture and the sound quality with music is outstanding. Problem is it doesn't do what I bought it for and what it is advertised to be; be a solid gaming headset.As others have mentioned the Vista drivers seem to be the source of the problem and after writing the company I could not get any time frame on when they plan on updating the drivers. At times you can plug the headset in and it just won't work at all. Other times the headphones work and the mic doesn't. Other times everything will work for a few minutes and then give a system resource error and you are forced to reboot. It never just works without some sort of drama.For those interested I using it on and XP machine you should have much better luck as it works on my XP machine just fine. It's simply too much trouble to bother with this headset using Vista.
3,Meh,The product works good except for the speaker in the headphones seem to be cheap. It just doesn't sound good compared to others that I have used. But it is durable on the plus side.
2,Do not work with Windows Vista,"I bought this headset to use primarily for home schooling children for interactive educational software. The quality seems very good and they are packed with features. When they work, the sound is excellent, and the microphone works well too (when it works.) Unfortunately, it is 9 months now since a preliminary, very buggy driver was released for Windows Vista, and still no update. Windows tries to run the software for this as ""legacy"" software, but does not do well. I think I would give this a five star for how well it is made, but it only works about 20% of the time in Windows Vista, so I give it a two. Tritton obviously does not care about selling this to Vista users, or many of us wouldn't be having these problems. What a disappointment. Maybe in a year or two they'll have a working Vista driver, but by then we'll probably have another version of Windows. Shame on you Tritton for not keeping your drivers updated on such a narrow range of products you sell."
1,Watch out for the quantity!,"Maybe I read it wrong, maybe it is truly confusing... Either way, I thought I was getting 9 packages with this order. Instead I got one package that contains 9 wipes in it. That is practically 40 cents per wipe! Ridiculous. I just don't want anyone else making this mistake."
4,Love the wipes; Cheaper elsewhere,"I LOVE these wipes for traveling, especially with kids. I use these to wipe down all surface areas on the airplane before the kids unpack or get settled. They last longer than Wet Ones for a job like this and don't dry out as quickly. Just purchased them at T**get for less than one dollar for a 9-wipe pack, so definitely price compare. Overall, fabulous product for on-the-go."
1,Rip off!!!,"I purchased this thinking it's 9 packages for the price and thought, ""awesome deal!"" It turned out to be 1 packet with 9 sheets. Complete rip off! Here's a better deal: go to Walmart, head to the isle with all the trial/travel sized items and pick up 3-4 of these packets of wipes for the same price."
1,I'll never know....,"Amazon won't let me order this item, when I try to checkout it tells me that it can't be shipped to my address. What? I live in Tucson, Arizona. As far as I know there are no trade embargos with Arizona and we don't have any shipping restrictions to my regular suburban neighborhood. As a matter of fact, one of Amazon's biggest distribution centers is in Phoenix, a mere 90 minutes away by slow car. I've been ordering from Amazon for years, and every Christmas order quite a lot to be shipped to my address. I contacted customer service via chat and she told me that it can't be shipped to my address, but she has no idea why not. Oh well, guess I'll never know if I liked this item or not."
3,Only for wanna-be animators.,"Bought this much hyped, stylish book and found out that the book (and CD that comes w/ it) DOES NOT have any character animation tutorials. What it DOES have is some SFX tutorials, simple Flash movies, templates (maybe you'll need 'em, maybe not) and a few very short & simple Flash animations (w/ all the layers for you to tweek). It's NOT a step by step, ""how-to"" book and more than 3/4 of it talks about all the animation stuff you've heard a million times before (animation history & principles, production pipeline, interviews). It talks about what Flash CAN do, but not HOW to do it. A good book for Flash people who know nothing about animation production, but not for animators who want to learn Flash techniques."
2,preying upon a master,"look, this is simply a warning for anyone who really gives a damn about one of america's greatest directors--this writer-Weddle-is full of CRAP. not only did he rip-off most of the descriptions etc of the shooting of THE WILD BUNCH from other sources but he truly doesn't understand the intensity of ART--he's an ass who is willing to denigrate classic films of despair like THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE as ""corny"" and peckinpah's masterwork--CROSS OF IRON--as ""embarrassing."" my question is: how many times did he ACTUALLY WATCH CROSS OF IRON?sorry, i'm ranting, but this guy Weddle is a punk--even the title of this biography shows what a cheap & superficial writer he really his.pity he never met the man he was paid to write about.--jra"
2,Not bad for the price,"My main complaint about this set would be that the clear chess pieces have a very noticable line around them where the glass was pressed into a mold. I rated it low on the ""toy"" scale because it is not a toy and should not be bought for children. The ""board"" is a large piece of thin glass that I would not want children playing with.If you want to buy this for someone who likes to play chess on occassion I think it is a decent choice. I would not buy it for someone who plays regularly because a big heavy, fragile glass set is just not convenient....I think that [the price] is probably too much for this item. [But] If you can get free shipping on this set it is a good value."
5,A great chess set for years to come,This chess set is an amazing familey tresure. I know I will be able to pass this down to my family for years. It even says that if you lose or break a pice the company will replace it! What more could you ask for?
1,nice!,"We have this set as an ornament,not actually a game so it is probably strange that im typing a review.But I just want to say it looks nice!"
5,Lovely Chess Set,"I bought this set at the store. First, I had planned to buy it on the internet, but when I saw the price for shipping I nearly died.This chess set is extremely lovely, and very elegant-looking on my coffee table. It seems to be very durable, seeing I have dropped the pieces a few times (an unavoidable hazard) and they have not chipped. Also, the chess board is quite heavy-duty, but not tacky or oversized.The pieces are beautiful, though I have argued with my brother over which one is black and which is white. The squares are frosted and clear and also difficult to chose which is which, but I'm not too 'chessly' oriented, and having not played on a glass set before, I just close my eyes and choose.I enjoy chess immensely, and find it to be quite educational and good mind exercise.I hope this review helps those who are in doubt. :)"
1,It came shattered to pieces,"I bought this as a birthday present for my wife after a lot of research. She wanted a glass chess set for some time now. It arrived today and she was pleasantly surprised.The happiness ended there. I have not even opened the box a little and glass pieces started falling out of the box. The board inside was completely shattered. The broken glass pieces almost scratched my wife's and my hands. The packaging(cardboard, bubble wrap) were all intact. The item itself was damaged beyond hope. This was such a disappointment. Thanks for ruining our day. I hope they will send a replacement. Yet to hear back from the seller."
3,Brown tint,"The board has a brown tint, and the pieces break too easily. The size however, is great for the price."
2,ok,chess overall is a 5 star game but i don't like this set someone bought it for me for chritmas and you know its the thought that counts but I think glass sets look tacky I'd rather have wood one and the pieces that are supposed to be black make my fingers feel all weird so I really hate them i'd tell anybody to buy a wooden game
3,Works half the time,"It worked for a few days, now its on the fritz. Hopefully just batteries, or I will have to look for another one. It was the correct model for my car and the company does have a 30 day guarantee so I can't complain since I was too lazy to contact them when it first started having problems."
2,Too scientific to interest my toddlers,"Being slightly arachnophobic, I want to teach my children about spiders and show them that they need not be afraid of them. I thought this book would be an excellent opportunity to teach them about spiders.Although the book was written in simple language, there was a plethra of information. It was far too much to hold the interest of my 2-year-old and 3-year-old. The illustrations were scarily accurate, but not very colorful. I was also a little uncomfortable showing my children such detailed drawings of spiders ingesting their prey.I think the author would be better suited writing textbooks for 3rd-4th grade science class."
5,Very Good Book,"I simply LOVE this book: it's fun and easy and improves your lettering and calligraphy in an easy way. I practice calligraphy since 10 years, but still I found in this book some ""shortcut"" to make my works more accurate.Great space for practicing, lots of alphabets shown, a nice way to introduce arguments ... a must have book for all calligraphers."
5,Good buy,"This book is excellent. When I received my book, I started to practice for 1 week and now my handwritting is pretty."
2,Not what I expected,I thought I was getting a set with the book and pens. My mistake for not reading it properly. I also thought it was going to be for a younger child. It is really at an adult level.
1,Not good,"This isn't a good book. There are much better ones on the market. To have a book printed in calligraphic hand seems to beinteresting, but it actually turns out to be methodologically not so. Much better is to have the book in normal print and theexamples in calligraphic hand. There is no contrast to help thelearner see differences. Moreover, this author may be a gooddoer but to put the message across is quite a different thing:her explanations aren't that clear.One more point: this author needs to be urgently introduced tocopperplate hand. She does not mention it at all. As an author teaching beginning calligraphy it'syour moral obligation to show the hands. After all, copperplateisn't one example of a hand; it1s a hand in itself."
1,Not what I want,"It does not teach the type of write i want to learn, I want to write as what people does in their ordenary life, not for loyolty of government post. It seem stupid, it is just my first impreesion about it."
3,Not as expected,"This book give a ""comprehensive"" explanation of calligraphy perhaps, but it show how to write a complete alphabet or provide complete alphabets to learn."
4,A great gift for a calligraphy nut,"I purchased this book for a friend who does calligraphy; she absolutely loved it and spent hours looking through it, and will spend many more using it!"
2,"Went from ""I like it"" with this show, to ""I don't like it""","It took me a while to actually watch this show (it's broadcast on my PBS channel), but once an episode ""caught"" me, the show grew on me. Until I made the mistake of watching the episode ""Looking After Our Own."" Too sick for my taste. I will not be re-visiting this series."
3,"Good, but not as good as the English version!!!","Why 3 stars, because i'm English which means I get to see the full length version on the BBC.So if your are thinking of purchasing SPOOKS, which you bloody well should, then you should take mine and DAVID's advice and get it from AMAZON.CO.UK.series 1 is amazing, series 2, is even better, series 3 just KICKS ARSE! and series 4 well... you must get the message by now!(well, ya never quite know with you americans)AAHHH! still so young...But anyway, the ENGLISH version is definately worth the 5 starsand if the Language is too hard for you mere mortals to understand then I do strongly sugest you check out BBC.CO.UKand go to BBC america, where you can find a ENGLISH DICTIONARYwere you will be able to translate PHRASES, WORDS ect."
5,Great show,"Even when predictable (which isn't that often), MI-5 is a great spy show. Well written, creative and well acted. I've never met anyone who's seen this show that didn't like it."
3,"Good, but a bit overrated","I think this show is certainly watchable and has many good qualities, but I guess my expectations were higher based on the high marks it's received in reviews here. The plots seem a bit contrived and PC. Also, the spies themselves honestly don't impress me as all that smart, as they keep doing stupid things and getting caught. Now that I've seen the entire first season on DVD, I can't say that I was really all that excited about seeing what happens in the next episode. And while I agree with others that there is a lot of drivel on American television, we definitely have many high quality shows that I think surpass this one (Sopranos and Six Feet Under come to mind.) Bottom line, this is an above-quality, enjoyable show but not the best thing I've ever seen."
4,A Great Television Series,"Its not 24 or Alias, so if you are looking for something like that you will not find that here. The pace of the show is different. But you will get a well produced and well acted show with great story lines and little glimpse maybe into how the British see the security of the world and the terrorism issue. I think that the great bit about the show is that no character is sacred and any one at any time can be written off. I only gave it 4 stars, but I am a bit of a miser. Everyone I loaned the show to loves it. I already own all 3 seasons. More than well worth the money."
4,"Show 5 stars, price 1 star","As someone who actually has the set let me tell you that they are NOT the edited versions that air on A&E.; These are the original broadcasts from BBC. Each episode runs 60 minutes start to finish. (not the typical 45 minutes of American TV shows edited for advertising time).The major down side of this set is that whlie American television series typically have 20+ episodes in a sesaon, MI-5 (aka Spooks) has 6 episodes in it's first series. That's all this box set contains. $40 for 6 episodes is steep in my book.That being said. It is an excellent show. Great production values, intelligent action (outsmart more than outgun), solid acting and conceivable plot lines (abortion clinic bomings, racist groups, hostage situation at an embassy). If you are looking for the british version of 24, look elsewhere. I love 24, great fun, but this is vastly different. It's a thinking mans spy show."
4,Outstanding,"If you liked the Sandbaggers series (MI-6), you'll love MI-5. Can't wait for Volume 2. Would have rated the series a ""5"", except for the music, which is extremely loud and sometimes overpowers the dialogue. Smart writing, great acting, lots of twists and turns. Enjoy!"
5,"Enjoyable viewing, well written.",Writing. Acting and production are all well done. Very enjoyable viewing that keeps you engaged. Series ages well even if the plot lines are now more history than headlines.
2,difficult menu navigation,"I recently received, and attempted to view, MI-5, Volume 1. The problem is an obscure, and difficult to navigate, menu. When the dvd starts to play, we are shown, what appear to be scenes from the series. However, after a little while, I realised I was actually watching the 'start up' menu. Sheer luck allowed me to press 'play', and view the first episode.I waited for the second episode in vain. Instead, the overly complex 'start up' menu reappeared, and, despite strenuous efforts, I couldn't access episode 2.I had the same experience with each of the three discs. I could watch the first episode on a disc, but not the second.Subsequent research showed that this has been a problem for many people. I don't understand why the format hasn't been changed in the seven years since the dvd was first released.I won't be buying any other dvds in this series. What's unfortunate is that the series itself is enjoyable, at least what I was able to view."
3,Better British spy fare does exist,"Now, I do like and own the first two series of MI-5, and will at least watch the third series. That being said, I do feel the British series The Sandbaggers (slang in that series for MI6's special operations division) is a better examination of the dirty world of espionage without any of the glitz or glamor lavished over MI-5. Or, if you don't mind the slower pace, get the productions of John Le Carre's Smiley's People or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy."
5,Sublime Series,"At the beginning, I did not know if I was going to like the series. Boy, was I wrong, great plots, great acting, one suprise after another. This has become my favorite series of all time. I have also been amazed by the cast that has been brought together for the shows. Each and ever one of them plays their roles excellent."
4,Brittish TV Series: Routinely Excellent,"The first episode was not as good as I had hoped, but they get better and better. What's not to like when a series is developed by PBS."
5,Top of the line show.,"If more US writers and broadcasters put a show like this on the air, I might start watching more of their broadcasts. This is TV at some of it's finest. Love this show...ALL Seasons!!!"
3,holding out hope that it improves,"I enjoyed the show; but, it wasn't anywhere near my top 10. I'm holding out hope that it will improve in the next season. Since most of the reviewer have stated season 2 is better I'll probably give it a go."
3,Well it's tv....,"I don't expect much when I start a new series. I'm am an anglophile. I will watch any Brit show and give it a chance.Some of the story lines can be a little dry, but I like the action and they generally keep me interested. Plus the fact that Tom Quinn is about the hottest freakin character helps MAJORLY!!! YUM"
3,"Not great, but watchable","I am one of those who watches a show, gets into it, and doesn't worry about logical or detail flaws unless they are glaring. MI5 Season 1 has such flaws in abundance (I can't get OUT of the house? Even Britain has fire codes.)God, I hate when every actor appears to have red-stained lips. The show's producers/directors appear to assume that any cosmetology school graduate is a fully qualified makeup artist. Plainly, this is not so!So, I have to examine whether there is enough action, drama, what have you to outweigh my misgivings. I observe that I am trying to find MI5 Season 2 at a reasonable price point (for ME, that is about $30). Therefore, there must be enough to keep me interested or I would just blow it off."
2,Only if there is nothing else to watch,"Watched a few minutes and decided that I would stick to American television. There are some British shows that I watch, but this one won't be one of them."
5,"Do You Like English Scenery, Architecture, Accents and Drama?","If you love English scenery, architecture, accents and drama, you'll enjoy this literate spy series. Just watched this first show in the series and loved it. The actors are familiar (Mr. Darcy) and are a delight to study. There is an intriguing and fresh story line. Enjoyed the competition with the CIA in this story. I'm looking forward to watching many more shows. Viewing shows like this is the next best thing to visiting England for us Anglophiles."
1,Mind numbingly awful,"This stunningly bad BBC confection can best be summed up by A&E;'s somewhat desperate use of Nickelback to trail the third series in the US: An unconvincing set of second hand ideas, thrown together without the wit to make it truly compelling, but with enough po-faced bravura to ensure a baffling degree of popularity.Horribly bereft of irony, its attempts at action are feeble and the reviewer who mentioned Le Carre should really watch Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy again, very soon. George Smiley would run rings around these children.Series 1 contains one of the most sickeningly manipulative twists ever committed by a cynical scriptwriter desperate for ratings, and each series ends in the most preposterous manner since Blake's 7 dispatched it's entire cast with monotonous regularity.Saddled with the least convincing hard-man lead since Roy Dupuis' laryngitis-riddled performance in La Femme Nikita, this is thoroughly resistible nonsense."
5,well worth it,"If you have a DVD player that is region free, or can play region 0 DVDs, this DVD set is already available on Amazon.co.uk. There is a lot cut out of the A&E versions. Seeing the episodes uncut is well worth the price of the DVD set. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the second season of Spooks (which is the title of the show in the UK) Amazon.co.uk also has the CD soundtrack for sale."
5,MI-5: Best show on television,"I got hooked on this show from the first episode. Smart scripts and actors who don't chew up scenery (are you listening Kiefer??)The writers assume the audience has functioning brain cells and the characters are not perfect, just bright, funny, ambitious, and a bit quirky. The show is for everyone frustrated with the crapulous crud that passes for most of American television.Timely plots and yes, Americans don't always come off well but that's part of the charm. We do have a bullying reputation and the series makes a bit of hay with it. I can take it.As for the actors: MacFadyen, Hawes, and Agutter are especially good. They make you care and understand even when they are doing some very nasty things."
5,A fantastic first season to a great series,"Mi-5 or, as it is known in the UK, 'Spooks', is a really gripping, fast-paced series featuring some of the best scrips the 'Beeb' have ever got their hands on.This first season is a thrilling set of 6 episodes that catapulted the show to great heights. It's not quite as fast paced as shows like 24, but holds its own with a combination of large-scale production and wonderfully dramatic story lines.Whilst most people focus on the grizzly ending of episode 2, watch out for the amazingly intense end to episode 6, and indeed the end of the season, where you will be on the edge of your seat until the end and then completely surprised!"
5,An Excellent Handbook,"This book by Mary Oliver is an excellent resource for any poet seeking to improve their understanding of the craft. She acknowledges the need for creativity and experimentalism, yet does so by confirming time-honored techniques and explanations of formal structures. I tend toward the free verse form of poetry, but do dabble in iambic rhyme. I have always felt that structure is the enemy of good poetry, but have also felt the inexplicable contradiction of appreciating Robert Frost and Shakespeare. This book explains what I could not put my finger one and has convinced me that structured poetry is just one of many forms and free verse, for all of its worth and value in the modern pool of poetry, is not the only valid form.I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand poetry better, both the reading of it as well as the writing of it. Excellent job, Mary!"
5,Best book for poetry lover ever written.,"I am a poetry lover. I have read and written many poems. After reading this book, I realized that I was merely writing down memories, thoughts, and anecdotes. So much information (that every serious poet must know)packed into an easy-to-understand book. Such a delight to read this book. This is the first time that I've decided to write a review for a book, although, this is probably the 80th or 90th book that I have bought from Amazon. Thank you Mrs. Oliver!"
3,"Worth a read, but not crucial.","I find, if I really need inspiration and great ideas on writing, art and life in general, I get more from Brenda Ueland's, ""If You Want To Write"". But Ms. Oliver's Handbook offered some good suggestions for the working poet, and I very much liked her chapters on rhyme, meter, alliteration, and other poetic tools and structures. It gave me a nice refresher course, for someone who's been long out of school and away from the basics."
5,Mary's Gift She Was Afraid to Give,"Sitting at a picnic table, I was given a book on poetry writing by Mary Oliver. I carried it around like a candy bar, taking bites of its peanuts in chocolate words about words. She states that she was afraid to write it because she loved the subject too much. Yet what a gift of love she has given. And what more do we have to give, or does Mary for that matter, than the words we are afraid to say? Thank you Mary."
3,Disappointing,I hoped only the finest poems would be in the review but poems that are accessible and one's that do not need lengthy discussion as to poet's meaning. Not here. Many many poems are just the opposite.
3,Review of A Poetry Handbook,"Honestly, I did not find much help in this book. I did like the examples it gave from other writers, though. I still haven't finished it because I can't really get into it."
4,The best dog toy there is!,"This is a fun, fun way for both you and your high strung dog to get exercise at the same time. I hit it, he chases it, spins around, and barks like a maniac. Occasionally, I let him ""win"" by hitting one at him soft and low.In terms of a tennis TRAINER, I would say that's where this product fails. Unless you're really concentrating, its really easy to break proper form for the sake of getting to the ball. As someone who can hit a ton, it's hard to gauge how far and how hard you are hitting the ball when it keeps coming back to you.In terms of quality, the base has a nice heft that won't move no matter how hard you hit the ball, the rubber string is strong and well-made, and and the fact that this comes with an extra ball is a plus.One thing: Why doesn't Amazon offer replacement balls? If you play with this a lot, you go through balls pretty quickly. Two doesn't cut it!"
3,serving,Bought for my daughter to strengthen her swing but instead made her swing up at balls. Ok for serving but not for repeat hitting of balls. The ball does not return at good height for correct swing of racket.
1,Broken on the first day,"In the first couple of hits, the plastic piece that is connected to the ball cracked and cannot be fixed. I'm so disappointed given the cool video demos on the website. I'll be returning it to the store later today."
4,Interesting,"It was a bit hard at first. But once you are good at playing Tennis, its Simple. It would have been better if the balls have more air pressure in it."
2,"My teamates love to play it, but it doesn't bounce back","once you hit the ball, it bounce back at first , but it bounce back really low, and it is really frustrating because you have to bring the ball back and hit it high again. somehow it is very difficult to play it continuously because it doesn't stay high when it bounce back!"
4,"Point system is not for everybody, but it worked for me","The hardest part of exercise is getting started. This program really helps because it makes every little bit count. You can start by doing lite exercise and move up to more strenuous workouts. If you are already in shape and exercising regularly, you can also benefit. I found the point system fun -- kind of like taking a quiz in a magazine."
2,Not much for the money.,"For $5, you only receive 5 pages of ""teaching"" material, which is mostly questions to ask or definitions of the 5 purposes. The rest is an article simply reprinted from Christianity Today. I think the description should state this because I never would have purchased it."
5,"Biography of my great-great-grandfather, Dr Braxton Craven","This is a new cover on an old (1930's) text about the life of my great-great-grandfather, Dr Braxton Craven, the first President of Trinity College, which is now Duke University. I have some original copies but I wanted another one for my grandchildren to inherit someday. The 5 stars probably are applicable only to my family because of the age of the book!"
5,please be aware,"I too thought this was a fun toy for my child, little did I know! We have found out the hard way! Please be aware the rubber stopper on the bottom of the pogo stick comes off very easily, and is very dangerous when jumped on. My 7 year old was injured very badly!"
4,great fun for a 9 year old,My 9 year old daughter has a lot of fun with this pogo stick. It took her an afternoon to get the hang of it. So far the quality looks good. There are more expensive options out there but this seems to suit her just fine.
2,Too hard to compress spring,"My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily. Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work. Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner."
4,Love it,"Our 5 year old loves this pogo stick. She can't do it by herself yet but she's having a blast trying. If your child gets frustrated easy, it might not be the best since it takes a lot of practice. Otherwise, it is one of those timeless toys that you might recall using as a child yourself. It's very sturdy and has taken a while to break in but overall it was a great buy. Looked great next to the Christmas tree, too, with just a bow. Obviously, it's a better toy for the spring and summer--maybe by then she'll get the hang of it."
5,Great outdoor toy,"My son loves his pogo stick. He is always out there on his scooter, bike or pogo stick trying to do new stunts."
4,Pogo Stick,"I bought this Pogo Stick as a Christmas present for my 6 year old grand daughter and she loved it. My 7 year old granddaughter tried it and wanted one too, so I bought another one for her. It is perfect for the 6 thru 8 year olds."
3,polo stick,Well I would buy this again. Had ordered one 3 years ago and it was amazing. Could not have found a better one. Actually I bought it for my niece who was 5 years old.Her younger sister wanted one for her birthday and the family bought her one that was not as good. This is the second Maverick that they have now. This one from the order above broke after 3 weeks of recreational use of a now 6 year old.Must have been defective.
2,pogo stick,"Purchased this pogo stick for Christmas really as a joke for my adult children. They thought it was really funny too and actually enjoyed trying to jump on it but it doesn't really work that well, not much spring and bottoms out easily. I don't really think a small child could even make it work all that well!! I wouldn't recommend purchasing this particular pogo stick, maybe go with the next level up and maybe it will bounce better!!"
2,"As far as pogo sticks go, I guess this is okay...","My daughter wanted a pogo stick soooo bad for her 9 birthday, so I purchased this. I think she has only played with it about 5 times in a year. Not worth the money to me, but if you have a kid who loves these things, then I suppose it would be a good one to buy. It's fairly solid and sturdy...certainly nothing wrong with it other than my kids lost interest in it quickly."
3,Fun...,"Purchased for my 5 year old, but the weight is not right on it. He isn't heavy enough to make it bounce and he is a big kid. However, my daughter, 7, can use it and thinks it's pretty cool."
4,Good so far,My son got this for Christmas and has been bouncing around the house on it. It has been good so far. It did come with a sheet to order replacement parts for the foot pads and bottom part that is always touching the ground. They are inexpensive (like $2.00 or so).
2,mary,The footpeg was bent so bad when I opened this but since it was a gift to put under the tree on xmas eve I had no choice but to try to fix it and leave it from santa. It is almost impossible to use since it is too tight to bounce on at all.
5,Patrick's Pogo Christmas,"This was a gift to our 8 year old grandson who is a strong, handsome and well coordinated special needs boy. He's very active but is ""hooked on"" computer games, etc. After watching the pogo stick video he was ready to go. In less than a week he was bouncing up and down the driveway, attempting to turn 360 degrees on a bounce, and hopping up onto brick curbing. I see no end to his motivation to ""master"" this activity. His confidence is amazing and grows by leaps and bounds!It is important to match the weight of the user to the stick. The web sites made this issue very clear to a potential buyer."
5,Great Toy,Great alternative exercise to the usual bike riding. Bought the same one for my older son a few years back. Now both boys have one and they have a blast. They count and see if they can beat how many hops they did the last time.
5,Biggest Hit!,We bought this for our 9 year old granddaughter and it was the best thing she got for Christmas. It was a huge hit! Now her brother uses his razor scooter to go down the street and she follows bouncing along; great fun to watch.
3,Need some help,"Bought this for my son, who has had some great fun with the pogo stick. So much so, that we bought another for his best friend as a Christmas present. Both were having a blast. However, recently the rubber bumper which you land on has been lost on my sons, thus resulting in the pogo stick being unuseable. Does anyone know where to get this piece?"
3,Not what we expected,"My daughter's pogo stick looks more red and blue than pink and blue; as shown in the picture. Which was a little disappointing for my 6 year old.It's not a beginners pogo stick either. I hope that after lots of practice she'll get the ""jump"" of it! Right now she can not balance let alone jump.She really likes it, despite these setbacks...I just hope she gets to use it!"
4,good to go,"this pogo stick is well made. that is the first thought that enters your head when you see and hold it for the first time.i bought this for my 6yr old. she is small and does not weigh a whole lot. she has a tough time getting the spring to compress. she is somewhere between 45 to 50 lbs.i noticed a lot of reviews complaining that the tip wore down and kids were receiving head injures. so i bought and recommend getting a helmet, elbow, and knee pads."
4,Good Pogo Stick,"I bought this for my 8 year old last Christmas and she has enjoyed it very much. She now weighs right at 40 lbs and she can pogo for a long time. The pogo stick is very durable but certainly cannot deal with a grown-up's weight. It's great exercise for her because she always gets a good work-out when using it. I had a pogo stick when I was a kid and absolutely loved it.The only thing about this pogo stick which I think could have been done better and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is that the handle could have been wider. It's very narrow giving a small space for each hand to hold onto. I think it would be easy for a kid to accidentally let go of or allow his/her hand to slide and lose hold of the bar. But so far my kid hasn't so maybe that's an unnecessary worry on my part."
5,very pleased,"Bought this for my 5 year old..she is very active. The first day hopped 1 or 2 times, now one a week later is up to 16 to 20... really wears her out :-). before long she will be hopping down the street. it is not like the cheap one you'll find at the department stores ( k-mart, target, wal mart ) you can get at toys r us but you will pay more. Enjoy"
4,Son loves Pogo stick,"I bought this item for my 7 yr old son for Christmas. He has been wanting a Pogo stick for a while and was very excited to receive this one. He needs much practice before he will be good on it, but he does like it. The only con is that he seems a little too light for this pogo stick and it's hard for him to jump on it. But at least he will be able to keep it for years to come. Overall he really likes it."
3,Great pogo stick - but arrived looking used.,"My older son has an identical pogo stick in a different color and we have been very pleased with the product. Works great and has held up really well for the past two years. So, we purchased another one, in the blue and white color, for my younger son this Christmas. The pogo stick arrived and works fine. However, it looks like it might have been used and returned before being re-shipped to us. The white portion of the pogo stick is dirty/discolored, and there are knicks and scratches all over the metal portion. Unhappy that we paid a new price for a product that was likely used."
4,good pogo stick,we bought this pogo stick for our 6 year old daughter and she likes it. She is about 45 pounds and has a hard time making it jump but I think with some intensive parent spotting and a new helmet she will get the hang of it.
3,Tight resistance,This pogo is excellent except you can not adjust the resistance on it. You must bounce real hard to get it going.
4,pogo party!,"Used 4 of these for a birthday party for 3rd graders. Kids had a great time and surprisingly, none of them had ever been on a pogo stick, which made it even more special for a party. Nobody fell, no pools of blood.., no lawyers."
4,Great product for active children,"I bought the mid size pogo stick for my son's 6th birthday and ever since he received it, he has not stopped bouncing all over the place. It is very durable and sturdy enough for him to do his crazy tricks."
5,Great Toy,"I bought this pogo stick back in 2004 for my 6 year old. While at the time it was probably a bit too soon for her to actually use it, she loved the idea of having one. Now, three years later she's become an expert on the thing and bounces around like a crazy woman! :) It's held up very well! The rubber piece on the bottom comes off if you use it in the grass (who needs a professional lawn aerator when you have this toy?)but goes back on securely.Definetly worth all 5 stars."
4,Nice pogo stick...,"The pogo stick is rated for 40 to 80 lbs kids, my son is just over 42 lbs and the spring is just a bit too stiff for him. Once he grows into it it should be fine."
1,Won't jump!,My daughter is 50+ lbs. and can't make it jump. My husband took it apart and tried greasing the springs and it still is really tough to make it go up and down. Maybe we have a lemon? We're all disappointed and frustrated.
2,how my pogo stick collapsed,"I am dictating a review for my 8 year old son:When I was bouncing on my pogo stick, the part that the stick lands on fell out. I think that stinks. I am going to buy a better one because this on [the pop stick] stinks."
4,Great but weight specifications not accurate,"I think it is a great product, however it says it is for weights between 40 and 80 pounds. My son is about 45 pounds and can't get the spring to compress. Therefore it is useless until he grows into it. I think a more accurate minimum weight might be closer to 50 or even 55 pounds."
3,More dangerous a toy than the 'foam' leads you to believe...,"I got this for my 6 year old grand-daughter who assured me that she'd used one before at the neighbors. (That may or may not have been the truth.) The instructions warn that the stick will initially be very 'tight' and hard to make work, and that was certainly true. The first time it loosened up when she was trying to jump on it, it almost knocked her two front top teeth out. I'm glad they are still baby teeth since they have been wobbly ever since!"
3,a little disappointing,On Christmas morning the foam cap over the top center popped off. Doesn't effect the way it works but I still do not expect that to happen.
4,Pogo Stick,Our nine year old grandson is having a great time with it. One caution--he used it on the basement cement floor and it was slippery. The outside sidewalk seemed safer.
1,WORST TOY EVER,"DANGEROUS FAULTY TOY! My son is 10 years old and weighs 60 lbs soaking wet. I got him this for christmas, Within 30 minutes of use the toy flew apart sending my son crashing and pogo parts and grease flying accross the room. I am attempting to return it but so far we have not gotten any response from Amazon.BUYER BEWARE..... THIS TOY CAN SERIOUSLY CAUSE INJURY AND HAS HORRIBLE QUALITY ISSUES."
3,Not for big kids,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter. Not a good move on my part. I think this particular item was made for little kids because she toward over it. She used her own money for this and was very disappointed to have to give it to her 8 year old cousin.
5,Flybar Foam Maverick Pogo Stick,I purchased this pogo stick for my grandson's 8th. birthday. He really loves it and just can't stop jumping on it. He has a twin sister whom I purchased a different type of pogo stick for and it's just not as easy to use as this one! I would recommend this pogo stick to people with active children. This is a great form of exercise. So far so good with the quality of the product. I will give the pogo stick five stars! Thanks Amazon for the speedy shipping and great price. In a week I will purchase this same pogo stick for another granddaughter!
5,Best Gift,"I purchased two pogo sticks for granddaughters who were celebrating 7th birthdays. Both girls said the pogo sticks were ""the best"" and were their favorite gift. It took about one afternoon for the girls to get the hang of the pogo. One granddaughter became a pogo machine and can jump over 1000 times. The other who could only jump 11 times is now over 300. The girls jump on the driveway and in the grass. They jump frontwards, backwards, and left and right. The pogo stick has been one of my best birthday purchases. I have read some reviews that say the black tip wears out, so I told the parents to watch the tip and replace it if needed."
3,A little disappointed...,"A little disappointed because the reviews that I read said this would be perfect size for my daughters age...but nothing was mentioned about the child's weight. She doesn't weigh enough to make it work...I guess she'll grow into it! Also, I didn't realize but target sells this same exact pogo stick for almost $15 LESS! Next time, I'll do more research."
2,defective,"I purchased this particular model for a 10-yr. old boy who was within the suggested weight range. It made a terrible noise of metal-on-metal rubbing and didn't seem to bounce back as freely as it should have. I had puchased two different pogo sticks for other kids at the same time and they ran a lot more smoothly without the horrible noise. I think the unit we got was probably defective, so we returned it to amazon. It appears to be a well-constructed model for younger children."
1,poor quality,My daughter opened this first at christmas and was so excited to use it but after about 12 jumps it broke? I tried adding a little grease thinking maybe they forgot but nope that didn't help. It is surely broken. The spring is broken. Theres no jumping on this one! Poor quality. Her age and weight are well within the limits and that should not have happened.
4,pogo,this was bought for my 6 year old hes about 50lbs and could not even get it to go down with his weight. we had to have dad break it in and grease it up alittle and now it works better. not really good for lighter kids.But it is very well made all steele and foam.
2,perhaps kids can grow into it - but hard to use,"The springs are so tight on this product that it's impossible for a kid under 50lbs to use. We bought two, and found they are both the same."
3,Hard to use for the posted age group.,"This pogo stick is well constructed and seems solid. The only criticism I have is that it says it's suitable for 5 and up. Actually, 5 to 9 and up. I have an almost 7 year-old, who is very well coordinated, but has found it impossible to use. If you're child is on the small side, they will find it very hard to compress it enough to get a good bounce and she has not been able to really get it going. So we'll keep trying and hopefully as she gets bigger and older she'll be able to use it."
3,Great toy....,The toy arrived by the date that it was promised. But when my godson attempted to play on it it didn't bounce very well. It seemed like it needs some oil.
5,Suomy Vandal,"I really liked this helmet. The fit, finish, mechanical details, and super light weight were just what I was looking for. Very good looking too, the photos online don't really convey well. However, the article I received was manufactured in 2007 and is therefore not allowed on the racetrack, and generally speaking it was out of date. I returned it. :("
3,Cute Story & Great Illustrations,I got this book to read/interact with to my dance classes--the older kids loved it as much as the little ones! This does have some big words that I had to help them sound out but they all loved the story.
1,Very disappointed with this yoga mat,"Hopefully this was just a bad batch of yoga mats -- left in a hot warehouse or something.The mat began to fall apart in the first couple of uses, leaving bits of mat on the floor and my clothing. Amazon was very good about sending a replacement -- which did the same thing.Had to send both back."
2,Loved and Lost,"At first, I wasn't a huge fan of this mat. I liked the color a lot but it was too thin, smelled odd, and was slippery. After using it for a few weeks, the slippery coating wore off and it turned into a great mat. About a week later, it started flaking dime sized chunks. It never stopped. You could tell every studio I visit and ever room I had been in because there was orange confetti everywhere. I still want to use this mat, but it's in such bad condition. I contacted Gaiam and they sent me a new mat of my choosing, which was very nice. I picked a TPE mat, figuring it would be better. It doesn't flake, but it scratches like crazy. Still not pleased... on to my next mat!"
4,Baltimore Orioles,"Very good DVD. Entertaining review of three world championship seasons ... Brooks and Frank Robinson were unbelieveable! And three different managers took them to the top -- Hank Bauer, Earl Weaver and Joe Altobelli. Thoroughly enjoyed."
2,Logo Imprint Compromises Presentation,"I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories. I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film). Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs. What's that all about? Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills? Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years!Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise. But....that logo is really annoying."
1,Deceptive title and content!,"The cover says ""Brilliant Insights into How Trout Act and Why by the Authors of The Trout and The Fly"". This book is actually certain chapters of The Trout and the Fly, choosen by Lefty for his ""Little Library"". Nothing on the cover, front or back, tells you this, which I feel is quite deceptive. In fact, the cover text leads you to believe that is a new book from the authors. So, if you have read The Trout and the Fly, you have read this book. If you haven't read The Trout and the Fly, get a copy of that and get the whole book, rather than this butchered reprint. Seeing that I own The Trout and the Fly, I will be returning my copy...."
3,Guitar World,"I like Jesse Johnson's r and b and pop stuff better than this album. It's really heavy on the guitar and overpowers everything else. There's a couple cool songs on here. I really like ""Nevermind Saturn Sunrise"". It's a cool instrumental, a trippy shockadelica jam. Maybe this cd will grow on me, I've only heard it once so well see how it goes."
5,good overview of early christian beliefs,"Even if you did possess the entire collection of the Ante Nicene Fathers, most folks wouldn't know where to begin to research what all of them said regarding any particular topic. This dictionary solves that problem. And it is even better than an index of where to find passages on those topics since the actual passages are printed out for you to read. Comparing writings is much easier since you don't have to search through several different books - they are all in one spot. While we must acknowledge the fact that the writings do not necessarily represent ""dogmatic theological pronouncements,"" if you are interested in dicovering what the Early Church Fathers believed, do yourself a favor and get this book."
2,Too many heretics in one book....,"2 stars instead of 1, because of the (sparse) quotes from St Irinaeos, the Apostolic Fathers and the Didache.The texts quoted are not newly translated but a compilation from the ANF series from the 19th century.Buy the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church instead!"
2,Not balanced,The author of this book doesn't appear to have the same view as the Catholic church on a number of topics. I'll get my Church Fathers cd out and read them myself...
4,Excellent resource,"Bercot's Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs is an excellent resource for finding quotable quotes and getting a good sense of the thoughts that the early church fathers had about our faith and their culture at large. Some of the quotes are surprising and eye-opening. The indexing is easy and cross-references are very simple, so that you do not have to exactly guess the title for the topic. An excellent resource."
5,Greatest Biblical Commentary,"The early Christians have an advantage over Bible students today because they where closer to the apostles and Scripture in 1) time, 2) geography, 3) figures of speech, 4) culture, and 5) theology. Therefore, this beautifully condensed compilation of their writings on hundreds of subjects is the greatest commentary a Bible student could ever have."
5,Great Book!,This is a great book for every serious Christian. We need to see how the early Christians applied the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.
1,Shouldn't have been printed,"This is the worst book I have ever bought. The author tries to cover many topics, but he does so so pitfully that the reader is really left clueless. The organization of the book is very loose, and he scratches every topic only on the surface. Don't be fooled by the microsoft windows logo on the cover, save the thirty bucks and buy yourself some game CDs."
1,awful :(,"This book should be given off free by Microsoft. All it seems to do is advertise the NT operating system, and presents a bunch of case studies eulogising the NT operating system, again.Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the typographic errors on almost every page. Sometimes you don't know when one sentence ends and the other begins."
5,holycrapthisalbumsawesome,"The album is probably the most unique I have ever heard. I'm a person that puts the tone of the lyrics above all else. The band syncronizes so well to set the mood for what the lead singer is trying to express, almost like you can already understand what the song is about just by the melody of the songs."
3,Chair stong but not size expected,"The chair is very nice wood with sturdy build. Easy to put together. Unless I misunderstood I thought the seat was suppose to be 12"" from the floor and it is 10. It is not tall enough to use with the table I bought it for. It is very nice, I will just use it elsewhere or give it as a gift."
5,Toddler Chair,I bought this chair for a little 3 year old girl. She loves it and its very sturdy and strong.The purchase was sent very quickly and easy to put together. I would recomend it for any child. Its perfect. Thank you so much. I love doing business with Amazon.
2,NOT for preschoolers and up,"This chair claims to be for ages 3 to 8, but my 5-year-old barely fits on it. I bought it to go with his kid sized desk, but this chair is so little that he has to reach up for the keyboard. The chair is probably fine for 3 to 4-year-olds, but that is about it. It does go together easily and is lightweight, so it does make a nice chair for the right sized child. The price is right, but unfortunately, that means I'm stuck with a pint sized chair because it is not worth the expense of return shipping. Very disappointed. I would not have ordered it had the description been accurate!"
5,Well made chair,"I ordered this to use with a child's table that has folding legs. The chair is wonderful and extremely well-made, but it was a little too short for the table. I will check the height better next time!"
5,"Great Chair, fits with table",This chair goes along with the table set we purchased. Our son loves using them to eat and play at. We move the chair around the house to different locations. It seems very durable.
2,Not as described,"SEAT HEIGHT IS NOT 12"". QUITE ANNOYING SINCE IT DOESN'T FIT THE TABLE WE HAVE... AND WE ALREADY ASSEMBLED THEM."
1,A BOOK OF NIGHTMARES,"In this book, Bingo runs away from a circus owner who is trying to shoot him with a shotgun, finds a child drowning (there is a picture of this), gets caught by a man who butchers dogs, gets caught by thieves who torture him, goes to prison, gets a nose replacement from a vet (picture of this, too), gets beaten up by the theives, then the boy gets kidnapped (another picture... kid bound and gagged), they threaten to ""turn the kid to hamburger"", but Bingo takes the bomb away and the kid finally gets to keep him.What part of this is appropriate for children??????"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Ok, I am from Indiana and like the Why Store, saw them in college, etc. So, when I saw they had a live album out I thought I'd give it a shot because they are great live. I was just worried the album would dissapoint as many live albums do. I was especially concerned when I saw a couple songs are 15 minutes long...I was afraid the Why Store was trying to be as boring as Phish or the Grateful Dead with some big long jams. Then, when I bought it and listened to it I was pleasantly surprised. The cds are great and really capture the energy of the Why Store live. If you like the Why Store at all check this out. I really think these guys would be big stars if more people knew about them and had heard their music! Spread the word!"
3,First legionaries,"Describes and illustrates not only the early armies of Rome, but of their Etruscan, Gaulish, Samnite, Latin, Venetian, and Pyrhhian enemies. The Epiran elephants and the Gauls are especially neat."
4,nice round based game,This was fun for some time... take out enemy fleets in a round based strategy game... missions are not terribly hard but entertaining for a while.
4,Cool Game,This game is great. The story line was pretty cool but yes as other reviews state I was disappointed that you couldn't completely control your ships. Everything else was enjoyable. Nice strategy game. Great battles.
2,Not enough action,"Not being able to actually be the one to fire the weapons is a let down. I wanted to battle, not just strategize."
4,GREAT TRANCE MUSIC,"This album is always playing in one of my CD players, it fits any mood you're in. I can dance to it, chill to it, and relax to it. This will definetely stay in my collection for life!!!!!!"
3,"okay,but not great","if you're into dreamy, smoothe trance, then you'll enjoy this cd. but if you're tastes are like mine, and you like harder trance that crosses over to a more progressive house syle, then pass on this one. i listen to taylor nonetheless, and think his amped up tracks on mixed tapes are unsurpassed . and the selections on this new cd are pleasant, you're not likely to find a trance album with better transitions. however i listen to this type of dreamy trance when i want to relax. but for aparty atmosphere, i tend to stick with my christopher lawrence selection. i give trance america 3 stars for it's genius mixing. but it's lacking in the energy that makes trance the best dance music around."
3,A good Trance set.,"Taylor's opening is mind-blowing, the second track comes in the vocal lyrics and the bass come together in perfect harmony, the third and fourth track are one of the best deep house songs I've ever heard. My favorite track is number 7 how can you not like the song the end of the track when the bass comes in makes you wanna get up and dance. Jimmy Van M's Mix is ok I like the opening but the rest of it is kind of boring. So I'm giving it three stars because only the first Cd to me is good and only a couple songs on Jimmy van M's is ok."
2,Pass the tylenol,"Two stars in respect to the great music Ministry of Sound produces. But this album leaves me dissaponted. Only in small doses did this album get me at all intersted (about the middle of the first cd); but quickly settles back down to the coma-inducing hum drum of pointless, directionless beats and melody that butchers even the most potential tracks. Somewhere in the blue whale ocean scinetific research recordings you can slightly hear the pitter patter of what used to be an artists' work. A shame for electronica fans that like the upbeat melodies and climaxes usually defined by trance. I have not heard previous work by Jimmy van M or Taylor, but it is a slap in the face to a prestigous Ministry of Sound with a Trance label. For trance fans and collectors alike this cd will look good in your collection but leave a depressed feel once you eject it from your player."
1,Now in 'Used CD' Bin,"This is possibly one of the worst Trance efforts I've yet heard. In fact I've already cut my losses and sold the copy to a used CD retailer and was glad to have received half of what I paid. One would be better off to stick to the Europen staple of DJ's. This seems to be a half-hearted effort to bring US DJ's into a european market! Little of the music was compelling beyond the baseline, and that often seemed too hip-hoppy. Let your eye wander past this Trance selection."
3,This proves America is BEHIND in the scene,"Yet another release in the Nation series... this is the Ministry's offering to the US crowd. Deeply depriving i would say its like a jest at the America's. Van M and Taylor are absolute best at what they do and the sets are superbly mixed. What bothers me though is the tracklisting. Very reminiscent of the MOONSHINE label (Keoki, Rabbit in the Moon) For those of you who love the UK progressive sound through epic and highly vocal trance this is not it. For those of you who know and enjoy the uniquely American trance scene with a strong electronic groove and not so trance this would be it. For those die hard Ministry fans- yes they are once again accurate in portraying local sounds. Hence this is Trance Nation AMERICA. Please see the CLUBBBERS GUIDE TO... GERMANY or TRANCE for a more driving emotional sound."
3,"Not bad, but there are much better Trance CD's out there.",The first CD is boring; it almost put me to sleep. The second CD though is a lot better and is the only reason I keep this CD around. I like danceable tunes not lullabies. The second one is very good; too bad the first one wasn't like that.
3,"Decent , very much trancey","This was another of my first ""trance"" CD's. It clearly has changed compared to what trance music is now. If you want a really cool, decent trance cd to mellow out and chill this is it. It has emotions that run you up and down from energetic, to mundance slow."
2,Not what I invisioned,"This double cd set has a culmination of songs that I enjoy around the same number as a single cd. The songs are heavily stripped, and made flately, issuing great boardom. Even when newly bought, it recieved very little play and is now almost non exsistant in my listening world. The beats are so humdrum, and the songs so enui that I am always left wanting something greater, totally unfullfilling."
4,Different but good,"It looks like half the reviews here love this album, and the other half hate it. I think if you buy this CD expecting to hear Ferry Corsten-style epic trance, you will definitely be disappointed the first time you listen to it. I was definitely bummed at first. It's deeper and more subtle than your average trance CD--it's the kind of music where you put it on, lie down, and space out staring at your bedroom ceiling. But it's a great album in its own right. The second CD is especially good, creating a dark, unearthly atmosphere that gets very hypnotic. It kind of loses the plot after track 5, but picks it up again at track 10. Taylor's mix isn't as interesting as Jimmy Van M's, and the best tracks (1 and 2) aren't even very trance-ish. In my opinion, it's definitely worth the money, but if you're looking for dramatic, sweeping epic-trance, this probably isn't for you."
2,Not the same,"I have all four available Godhead albums (the first two are no longer in print), and I must say that this album is a far cry from their recent work. It has it's moments, but it's very boring, and most of the songs seem similar to each other. I understand that bands have to evolve, but I miss the grinding, gothic industrial sound of Power Tool Stigmata and the dreamlike melodies of Nothingness."
2,Just Like Everybody Else,"I love Godhead, and I love how original they sound. Nothingness, Power Tool Stigmata, and 2000 Years of Human Error all displayed their unique approach to industrial and metal. All three albums had their distinct sound and style, but they all blended the electronic sounds and samples with metal guitar. Sadly, with Evovler, they seem to almost leave behind their industrial roots and opt for a more straightforward metal album. I don't feel that Jason's vocals suit this style, either. On past albums his voice seemed perfect for every song, but he does not have a purely metal singing voice. I understand that they wanted a stripped down album in order for them to all play the song exactly as it sounds live. Or their attempts at commercial success after years of sounding innovative without much recognition, and their constant moves from one label to another. I just wish they wouldn't have sacrificed some of their original sound in the process."
4,gODHEAD evolved,"For the first 4 or 5 tracks on this album, I was starting to get a little worried...they sounded a little more ""radio-friendly"" than the godhead I knew and loved. Then, I noticed that the tracks were actually transitioning slowing from the faster, more upbeat to the slower and darker. By the time ""Rotten"" and ""Without"" roll around, you're taken back to the slow, haunting melodies that characterized my favorite godhead album, Powertool. The guest vocals by Static-X frontman Wayne Static on ""The Givaway"" are interesting, but don't really add much to the experience. Overall, I would have to say this is my second-favorite godhead album behind Powertool. After a few more listens, though, it might just top it."
2,A change for the worse...,"Every CD, Godhead reinventes itself. Power Tool Stigmata and 2000 Years were the height of their career, and I personally felt that Evolver made the band start to lose their edge. Now they look goth with a disturbingly mainstream sound."
4,Finally...,"I waited for this CD to come...Yes, its changed from the more Goth/Industrial to more of a Metal sound, but with good reason...As Method said ""Well we have come a long way with the electronica side of our sound, and frankly we were getting a bit carried away during 2000 years of human error, it became hard to do these songs justice on stage since there were so many samples loops and keyboards that were intricate parts of the songs. We were heavily reliant on backing tracks. With these new tunes it's very liberating to sound more like a rockband again. I think fans will recognize it right away as typical godhead with a more guitar driven twist, kinda how we sound live on stage."" This CD is great...buy it if you can..."
2,Downhill,"I was really excited to take a listen to this album after 2000 years, but i have to say, the sound has really lost its edge. I can still enjoy this album playing in the background, but it is definately not one that i actually put on just to hear it. The songs on evolver are just way too bland."
4,James Bond,"This is a great game that has some pretty good grafics for the GBA. For a game that is this long, I think that it did great. It did have one level that I am having a hard time on and that is the last level, I can't figure out how to beat it. are oyur supposed to shoot some computer or the missile. Other than that, it was great. I am sure that I will figure it out soon, probably within a day or two."
4,Very Happy with this game,"This game is great,but it does have its downsides,like the fact that it only has nine levals and they are realy hard.But the graphics are super for agameboy advance. And the wide range of wepons is a big plus. The story is kind of cheesy but lots of different loccations like an under water tunnel and flying in outer space make this game a winner in my book. If you like first person shooters than buy this game and fast!"
4,best game ever,I will make it quick this game is difcult I have been on the 3rd mision for 9 months the grafics are great I want to get the plasma canon. its worth the wait.
2,Nightfire 007,"Fun, exciting game with james bond atmosphere sounds, graphics and weapons. This was fun, except it was way to hard, even on the normal setting. Characters appear very grainy and it was to tuff to tell who was the bad guy. Very frustrating game with no save points until the end of the level. I would always get to the end of a level, then die, and have to spend another twenty plus minutes to get to the end again. The characters bounce around to quickly, and it takes numerous shots to put them down, even about three head shots before they die. I finished it with cheats. For unlimited ammo - pause then R - left - L - right - Up - Select - right. For Unlimited health pause then R - left - L - right - Up - Select - left. Level select pause then R - left - L - right - Up - select - R. Good luck, you'll need it."
5,Very Informative on sports betting - must read for newbies,Alot of great info on sports betting - covers not only football but college basetball and MLB. Great section on what to bet each month. Well worth the $20. I dont write many reviews but the book was worth my time.
4,The Zen of Gambling: The Ultimate Guide to Risking It All and Winning at Life,"This is an inspirational book. There are no methods presented for picking winners. General rules abound. I'll probably read it again, for inspiration."
2,huh again,another of the many self congratulatory books flooding the market.....not worth the discounted selling price....even at .99 it would be too much....not more than another vehicle ofself promotion for mr root......wanna get rich? get a job.....following mr root's advice someone will indeed get rich....him... from all the suckers buying this book!
5,You better have your swing partner ready!,"Cause your going to dance all night long. This set says what swing musis is supposed to be about. I could't stop listening to it the first time I heard it. These arrangment bring me back to why I first fell in love with jazz. I can't stress how great this collection is. For anyone who is a serios lover of swing, this is it for you. And for those of you who aren't neccisarily into swing by this set it will change the way you feel."
4,like the sound of hollywood,"to me this was a fairly good book. i havn't bought it yet, but im going to try to. a friend had it and i liked it. its goo if your interested in animal actors. she has put good study in. she mentions things like tiki who plays salty on caroline in the city and sassy in homeward bound loves the camera so much she purred so loud somethimes they had to cut. its worth a try in my opinion."
4,Great book with alot of history,"This type of shooting will not make you a bullseye shooter. Its not ment for HRTs and their need for aimed/accurate round placement. This system does not make you a spray and pray shooter.This system is to teach a beginner how to shoot in a stressed situation, the same state that you are likely to use your handgun. The system take practice and does have its limits."
3,"Historical, more than practical","The book is a classic in tactical shooting, and of interest on that account.As far as practical information goes, it's sensible and clearly presented, although repetitious. The old photos are often unclear, and more sketches or photos, giving more detail, would be welcome.I'd advise anyone to borrow the book, rather than buy it."
2,Did not care for it.,The text repeats the same thoughts over and over. I was disappointed in the book. There are much better choices.
4,My life related to the examples given,"Because of some negative occurrences in my life over a long period of time I started to look into what might be causing the bad fortune. I had read about feng sui and was guided to Vaastu and ordered this book. I was surprised when I read the examples how closely they reflected what was happening in my life. I am definitely looking at moving from my home - the conditions can not be changed - and interested in seeing what happens. At this point, I really don't have much more to loose and can only gain by looking into a residence that reflects the requirements of Vaastu."
3,"A good, basic introduction","Lucidly explains the principles of vaastu, but does not completely satisfy, primarily because the author seems intent to keep this a brief introduction. Certain chapters need greater extrapolation.That said, if you want a basic primer on vaastu principles, have no worries about starting here."
3,Not a film for educators,"I purchased this film with the intent to show it to a group of nursing students to help understand a bit more about meth. The film focuses on biographies and less about teaching. The content will still be helpful, but not what an educator would look for."
3,Broke item,"The cover on the dvd player was broke, instead of contacting Amazon, I contacted the manufacture. They are fixing it and sending it back. It is just taking longer than anticipated. This will not stop me from purchasing items through Amazon. Another review can be made upon receipt of unbroke item."
4,Lots of fun,"I got this to use with the kids at church. We only get to use it about 3 or 4 times a year but they do love it! it would have been nice to have some game suggestions with the product, but all in all, it has survived the use of several rambunctious kids. We've had this for 2 years and it's still in great condition."
2,too much misinformation,"This book is O.K. for people who don't mind being stuck in the system. It discourages or prohibits home birth, sleeping with your baby, and 100% breastfeeding, without a shred of evidence. Of course, not all parents-to-be share the same principles, but it would be more fair for a book that claims to be ""for fathers"" to present the viewpoints of more than one ""type"" of father.Maybe someone can write a better book for fathers later on. It is a good idea."
2,Nothing for new fathers in here,"The title is great and seems to indicate that you as a new father can learn something from this book.I did not find that to be the case. It lacks structure and doesnt present information in an interesting way. The actual information is also scarce and nothing new is added to the ""normal"" books on this topic. As a new father you will not be much wiser on your new role after reading this book.I found Christine Harris's books to be much better and would recommend those."
5,Wonderful if you don't understand Shakespearean English,"For our 5th Form (11th grade) Lit class our Lit teacher recommended that we all use this book to help us with the drama. The original books which were given to us were difficult for many of us to understand. However, with No Fear Shakespeare and our wonderful Lit teacher we all passes Lit, most of us passed with B+ and up and I received 100 % on my English Lit exam as well as a 98% year average in Lit for that year !!! Recommended by me, my Lit teacher and my entire Lit class"
4,pretty fun,"although i am not much of a soccer fan, i really enjoyed this game, i thought it was more fun to play than NBA or NFL street series, only thing that was kind of annoying was during the one player story mode, they would make u do trick point challenges and gamebreaker games, i didnt like those rules, but other than that, i have no complaints, i liked the music, controls, graphics, and gameplay, even if ur not really into soccer, it is still worth a try"
4,Much better than FIFA Street 1,I didn't like FIFA Street 1 at all. It was awful. this game does a total 180 and is much better. A lot of fun.
3,This grill is huge,I bought this grill to replace another one of a different make. I didn't realize that is was so big. I still have not used it. There is just my husband and I and I expected something smaller. I got rid of the box it came in and the amazon box otherwise I would return it. Just does not meet our needs. We are both seniors.
4,Maxi-Matic 14-Inch Health Grill,I have only used the grill a few times as yet but it seems to do everythng that was promised.The food comes out tasty. The one negative feature of the grill is the over-flow tray is apt to spill over on the counter if not watched closley. That can get messy to clean up.
5,Grill,I store this for travel in a basement compartment in my RV. Use for under the awning of the motor home for grilling everyting from chicken to corn. Works great.
1,Not worth it!,The thermostat on these just isn't up to snuff. Had two of them. Had really high hopes. But the thermostat just shuts down and won't kick back in until your food is almost cool again. Terrible electronics. Don't waste your money or time. Same problem with two of them. Won't waste my time on a third.
2,Cheaply made,"I had one of these grills (almost the exact style) for about 5 years and it was great. After constant use, the teflon coating started coming off, so I purchased this one as a replacement. The quality is no where near my old one. The lid doesn't fit correctly and it is much thinner and lighter than my old one. It has been returned"
4,THIS is what the game's world looks like,"In a fairly abrupt shift from the last three volumes, Red disappears at the start of this one, and a mysterious boy grabs Pikachu and takes off. The first few chapters are introductions and setting Yellow off from the other trainers. Watching the world continue to change and grow is nice, and Yellow's so fun to watch running around. Recommended if you're a game fan, this is MUCH deeper than the anime."
5,Very good product,"I wanted something to suspend my CPU under my desk, but that would also slide forward/backward and turn. This product did the job at a reasonable price. It is solidly built of heavy-gauge steel and slides smoothly on steel ball bearings. It slides & turns with just the right amount of force; In other words, it's not ""free floating"" on the bearing track and stays put unless you deliberately move it. My CPU feels quite stable and secure slung underneath my desk. In fact, if I jiggle the cpu the whole desk moves along with it. I'm very happy with this item."
5,A stirring depiction of a vital debate of our time: the power of Faith,"In today's day and age, little attention is paid to the trials and sacrifices individuals give when pursuing a life of religious study, conviction, and guidance. That this show focuses on the stark issues of priesthood could be expanded to numerous faiths -- though the sacrifices of these 4 men may be arguable more difficult than other faiths. Students and scholars of religion and social science will find these DVDs a welcome tool in discussing modern religion and the challenges its stewards face. I enjoyed the show and look forward to sharing these with my colleagues."
5,Honest and entertaining...,"An engaging journey. God or the Girl will inspire you to examine your own life choices, beyond questions of faith. The energy these candidates invest in making the right choice is emotionally stirring. A+"
5,An interesting and fair portrayal of a challenging adventure,"When I heard they were making a ""reality show"" about men discerning a vocation to the priesthood, I was a little leery. Of course I had images of men in cassocks bobbing through scorpions and all the regular fare of reality shows.However having seen the series when it came out, I have to say I was fairly pleased. Obviously there are a few areas of contention, for instance the title, the choice is not between God or the girl but rather between whether God is calling you to discern a priestly vocation or is perhaps calling you to marriage. Either way, it's a choice for God.However I digress... In general I think these misconceptions don't detract from the message of the show. I felt the show was respectful of the men and their journeys and I found it a fair portrayal of a way of life that is often thought of as outlandish in modern culture."
4,All's good,"Having seen this at the cinema some years ago, and now watched ago. I found it great but with the subtitles to read. It was very fast reading this time around! But, happy just the same.. thankyou."
4,"Very touching, excellent cinematography","This is my first Chinese movie experience and I have been tempted to give it a five star. Only reason I held myself back is that certain scenes are slightly too make-believe. It could also be due to my bias against Asian perspective of realism, the realism that tend to have extra doses of magic in it. But each character acted so well! The beginning scenes of 1976 were superbly done, and story-telling was really good. I do not know much about Chinese or Asian family dynamics, but can only guess. The theme was universal--the dilemma a parent has to endure in extreme situations, the guilt, the quest for healing and redemption. The movie will make you stop and think ""what would I do?"" and it is hard not to feel sympathy for the central characters. Also, life goes on despite horror and suffering and the movie carries a humanistic tone about optimism.An exquisite work by Feng Xiaogang. I thank him and his crew."
4,Amazing movie!,"From my perspective this movie did not fall short from being a tear jerker. It was well done and the actors with the exception of this random white dude were amazing. The whole experience of the movie was ruined for me with that one white dudes acting...weird how only a few lines can affect your emotions. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!"
1,aftershock,it said there were english subs and also said it was in english language it was not in english language i would not have got it i could have seen this movie on netflix in a different language i did not no till i put the movie in i buy alot of movies from you i dont read fast so i dont like subs.just because you have alot of money does not mean i do ill have to think about if im going to do any buisness whith you any more. i no one custamer dont mean any thing to big buisness sighned edwin r hicks edwin_hcks@yahoo.com
4,"Not a bad little device, but where's the company?","I've used this for about 3 years now, and has worked GREAT on my media center... Just the other day I had an issue with the driver (don't know why) and tried to find the company's site... GONE... No idea where Blitzz has gone. The used to be something like www.iblitzz.com or www.blitzz.ca - but no longer. I like it, but I wouldn't buy it now..."
3,NO SUBTITLES AT ALL!,"WARNING: As an insult to Americans (meaning who speak English), this dvd of this great telenovela has no subtitles at all (not even for Spanish! And I read these are really popular in Russia too, so you'd think they would have subtitles). Therefore a complete ripoff for anyone who relies on subtitles. I had to take another star off because of how the telenovela is condensed and not the full series, but I guess that's just how they do these sets for market reasons. Oh well...Gabby Spanic is still fantastic regardless of the dvd shortcomings."
1,wrong language sent -- can't review,i ordered the english version and got the spanish. what do i do? i do not speak spanish and sub-titling is not enabled on the dvd.
3,RE: LA USURPADORA,I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WAS NOT AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE THE STORY WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE TO ME. WHO THE HECK EDITED THIS AND IS THERE ANY WAY TO STOP THEM FROM CHOPPING UP THESE STORIES. THEY REPRESENT MY CULTURE AND THEY NEED TO BE TOLD IN THIER ENTIRETY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I REALLY HATED THE EDITING. I WISH THEY WOULD RE-DO THE EDITING ON THIS.
1,La Usurpadora,"The DVD is done choppy, the story does not run like the version, (of the novela) showen on TV. The ending could not be understood! I hate that.................................................................................................................................................."
3,Poorly edited,La Usurpadora when it aired was a great soap opera when I purchased the DVD I thought that I was able to enjoy mostly the begining of it. There were to many important details that were suppose to be included by my opinion of course.
3,Gaby Spanic tour de force,"La Usurpadora was a good novela, but it was edited too much. Gaby Spanic is excellent! She plays twin sisters, one good, the other bad. Fernando Colunga , Chantal Andere, Arturo Peniche are worth watching also. The story was cut up so badly, now all I want is to see the complete novela! Plus, there's no subtitles at all. Therefore, this is not a classic DVD, but it is a classic novela. I feel I would not recommend it, it's been hacked to pieces! And no subtitles! I want complete novelas!"
2,VERY UNFAIR ABOUT USURPADORA,"WELL AS EVERYONE KNOWS LA USURPADORA IS THE BEST SOAP OPERA EVERBUT WHAT THE POINT WATCH WITHOUT SUBTITLES???I UNDERSTOOD THE ROLE 'CAUSE I HAVE SEEN IN BRASIL SO IN SPANISH I UNDERSTAND AS WELL BUT MY MOTHER IN LAW FOR EXEMPLO SHE AUSTRALIAN, AND SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND ESPANISH BUT THOUGH SHE LOOKS VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT GOING ON IN THE USURPADORA AND SHE ASK ME SANDRA PUT THE SUBTITLES ON PLEASE SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND UNFORTUNATELLY I HAD TO SAY SORRY IT DOESNT HAVE SUB TI TLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT SHAME SERIOUSLY IS REALLY DESAPPOINTED"
3,GOOD STORY BUT DISSAPOINTED FOR THE CUTTING SCENE!!,"I LIKE THIS TELENOVELAS VERY MUCH, especially the acting of Gabriela which i think very great since she must play two role..the story itself was great and not confusing.i have seen this in complete series when it was air on the televesion, but when i was thinking to buy this dvd in order to collected it.. i found that it was totally cut too many scene which i think was important and thats right NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE at all! i have try to play it on player & computer but still no subtitle, so please please to amazon and the xenon or televisa people..please make the complete series and added with subtitle, i'm sure that there are many fan's who wants to buy and collect this telenovela, not even just this one but for the rest telenovelas too. we wont be mine to pay more for that.afterall i really enjoy this telenovelas and still looking to buy another telenovelas.. so thankfull if they will soon released the complete series of LA USURPADORA."
2,Badly Edited,"By chance I came across ""Amor Real"" at a drugstore a few months ago. Out of curiosity I bought it. Fell in love with Fernando Colunga n became addicted 2 the DVD versions of telenovelas. Have bought several n have been mostly contented until I bought ""La Usurpadora"" no English subtitles, badby edited n overal bad acting except 4 Fernando Colunga.Couldn't wait 4 it 2 be over so I could just shelve it."
4,Good but not great.,"I agree with several of the other reviews for this item, and add that after watching it I gained some very useful information but felt it could be drawn out more and slowed down. I've been photographing for over twenty years on an intermediate, amateur basis but still found some of the information and logic hard to follow. In other words I think this is pitched from a professional's viewpoint who isn't quite able to bring it down enough to an amateur's level.There are good lessons to be learned here, and I think it was worth the purchase. I would love to see a revised release sometime."
3,Covers mainly studio photography,"This DVD focuses almost entirely on studio photography: use of the 580EX with carefully positioned diffusers and reflectors and use of multiple Speedlights under master-slave control (even though I suspect most studio photographers use strobes, not compact Speedlights).My shooting style is to take travel pictures and people candids. I wanted to learn how to use the 580EX mounted on my Canon EOS 5D camera to improve those types of pictures. On this subject the DVD is virtually silent. So if that's your objective, don't buy this DVD."
3,"Virtually useless for candid, travel, or real-life photography","Ditto George's comments. Although the host purports at the beginning of the video that, ""Wherever possible, we've kept this presentation simple and geared to the things you're most likely to shoot,"" I was very disappointed to discover that it concentrates almost exclusively on studio photography, along with a smattering of carefully staged outdoor photography with studio-type equipment. If your focus is studio photography, this dvd will likely prove very helpful. However, if you want to learn how to get the best out of your Speedlite 580EX or 430EX to shoot candids, travel photogrphy, or other real-life situations, do NOT buy this video."
5,Time and money well spent,"Watching this DVD was time well spent. In just over 1 hour, I understood more about lighting in general and using the Canon Speedlite 580EX or 480EX than I could have ever got from the manual or another book. The production quality of the DVD is quite high and it has chapter marks so that one can easily rewatch any section desired. It was worth every penny and more!"
2,Disappointing,"The DVD is informative, and easy to watch. However, I felt that it was not a great value for the price. It's very basic, and covers studio techniques more than anything. I was hoping for a more detailed explaination of the features of the Speedlite and why they work the way they do. Also, the video was shorter than I thought it would be.Additionally, the last part of the video focuses on how to use multiple Speedlite setups in a studio. If someone owns that much lighting equipment, they are already aware of everything explained by this DVD and probably will gain nothing by watching it.As a new user of the Canon Speedlite, I wish I'd have saved the money and put it toward more lighting equipment instead."
3,Helpful,"I found it helpful to a degree, but I wanted it for sports photography, and it didn't address this topic at all. So, if you're using for portrait or anything but sports, this should be very helpful."
1,Still Waiting a Refund For the Ityems I did not Order,I ordered one item and received a confirmation order in respect of that order. I next received a shipping email stating that the item had been shipped along with eight other same items. I am still waiting for my refund of 124.1pRegardsRobert Little
4,This ain't a bad book!,"I think this is a fasinating book.R.L. Stine explains histhoughts about aliens in this book,I think.I didn't get theending."
3,Geometrical Designs in Black and White,"This book is full of different patterns for use by craftsmen. Unfortunately, it has no color illustrations, and no information about sources for these designs. It is more like a coloring book than a resource for designs. However, it does have guidelines within each design to show how the design was created, and I find that useful."
2,Disapointed,There are many nice patterns in this book ... But no step by step instructions on how to make the patterns. I found this book to be of no use to me.
4,"Newer Sound, Mightier Band!","The new CD is great. I attended the CD release concert at Toad's Place in their hometown, New Haven, CT. After the a line of fabulous new songs I went over to the vendor and bought the CD, and a second one for a friend. Since then I've attended 2 other concerts. Although I wouldn't say ""How to Make A Living"" is far better than their previous CD's it is definitly worth the dough. Its a newer sound that seems to combine the crecendos and spooky solo/jams of Pink Floyd , with the qualities from more contemporary bands such as Radiohead, Phish, and the modern pop rock stars. However Imagine their previous CD's mixed with this new one-LIVE! thats what their concerts are like: Unbelievable! BUY IT! Fav. Songs: No One Is God and Keep My Head Above Water"
5,"Excellent, Comprehensive Resource","This work is an excellent overview of Islamic societies. Also, it is highly readable for a history book. Of course, it can get dull at times just as all really detailed history books must, but this work remains highly lucid throughout. The strongest breakthrough of this book concerns its treatment of the Arabization of Middle East and the developement of what we know as the modern Arab identity. However, to typify in a few sentence as book of this scope is impossible. Once you read it, you will find yourself going it back to it again and again for reference and for understanding modern events."
4,from a student's perspective,"This book is definitely comprehensive, but that is also perhaps a negative trait. It is something that is good to use as a reference, or if you want information in a specific basic area. However, reading it can be rather tedious, as his style is very dry and boring. It does provide a good solid foundation in Islam, but only for someone who can stand it! If you have never read anthing on Islam and truly want to learn, but something by John Esposito, his writing is a little more accessible."
2,NOT for beginners or the mildly apathetic,"This book is very comprehensive, which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background. As someone who knew nothing about Islam prior to reading this book, I was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that Lapidus has arranged. As you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book, it is VERY wordy. Like most history texts, it is also very dry and devoid of emotion. The author does, however, provide a complex view of Islam that is fair and accurate."
4,Windscreen for Shure Microphone,A good windscreen that fits particular Shure microphones. Helps remove ambient wind noise while mic recording. Fits easily on and protects the mic head.
5,Leadership style through life's lessons,"Mr. Wright has given us plenty to think about in GOING PLACES, which is a plain spoken book about life and leadership. He thoughtfully explains how his value system developed, and how those values shaped his management and leadership style. His lessons learned are shared in story form, which make the reading fun and the message memorable. I highly recommend GOING PLACES to anyone who aspires to excel in a leadership role."
1,"This seller is a no-show, no-go.","Not only did I never receive the product, the MLB Vintage World Series Films of the Yankees, the seller has never yet responded to my email query about its non-arrival."
5,Vintage Baseball Video,"Whether you are a Yankee fan or not these videos contain rare footage of the Yankees 17 World Series wins from 1947 to 2000. You will see rare footage of Shibe Park, Ebbets Field, The Polo Grounds, Crosley Field, Original Milwaukee County Stadium, and of course, old Yankee Stadium before the renovations. These are complete highlights of each of the 17 Series wins. If you were to purchase these individually you would pay several hundred dollars. The quality is very good considering the age of the original broadcasts. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching these classic games from the past. They are a must for avid historical baseball fans who would like to add to their collection. The 1958 World Series on are broadcast in color."
1,Easy Reading,"You won't need much of an education to enjoy this book. Simple words, simple ideas, and simple plot will make you reach for comic books to enhance the mind."
4,Twisting Wind,"After the Alarm split up, Dave Sharp released two solo discs. The firstHard Travellin'came out in 1991 and reached classic status for me as an incredibly consistent disc combining passionate delivery and excellent songwriting. ""Downtown America"" followed five years later and is more topical in its subject matter. It rocks hard on tracks like ""The Rebel"" & ""Drive These Blues Away."" ""Tender Mercy"" is an excellent track that is stylistically reminiscent of his first solo disc. Sharp's voice has a little harshness seeping in that becomes more apparent on the midtempo tracks like ""Road to Mexico."" ""Twistin' Wind"" is an excellent track with Sharp's excellent melody and searing guitar lead. ""Downtown America"" is a good album that sounds great a decade + later. Enjoy!"
1,On Becoming Real,"Boy oh Boy was this a waste of effort. Gail gets going really good with a great explanation about the ""unconscious"" and how it can sabotage us. I was thinking ""REAL GOOD STUFF"" Then she flops out this rediculous test that is far too over general and then proceeds to tell you stories of which you are to pick one or perhaps a couple of ones that you may be in synch with only to lose all validity.. I didn't find any of her story choices to be one that I could pick from.The book is far from being helpful and I am disappointed. Don't waste your money or time...Keep searching for your answers elseware..."
5,"Getting Real is ""Right On!""","I think Getting Real is ""Right On""! I read the book and really found it helpful in understanding myself and how I deal with certain situations. What I liked particularly is that it was ""down to earth"" - in language I could understand - with examples anyone could relate to. It was easy and interesting to read (not like a boring text book). Yet at the same time, the book makes you think about yourself and probe deep inside with the intent of self-awareness and self-improvement. Everyone should read this book!"
2,Written with a strong bias for female readers,"The book started out great with much promise, but as I got into it, virtually all examples and stories were specifically about women and written it seems, for the female perspective, which made it very difficult for me to apply the information to my own life. The questionaire for determing your personality type, which was integral for reading the rest of the book, seemed to be written exclusively for female respondants.This could be a great book for women on a quest of self-improvement, but I wouldn't recommend for men, unless your goal is to gain insight and understanding on the stories that may be holding back your wife, mother, daughter, etc."
5,Simplifies some very complex life issues.,"The author makes it clear as a bell how some of life's basic experiences can propell us to become involved in a pattern of situations that are harmful to us such as relationships that cannot possibly work out. With her clear insight into why my marriage and other relationships have been far from successful, I now see what I can change to make my life different instead of making the same mistakes over and over and over and over! I feel so much more hopeful of the future and feel much kinder toward myself and more understanding toward others who have been involved in my life. I now know how to behave differently to get different results. I now have more control of my future. The book may appear to be more geared to women than men, but the main points the author makes apply equally to men and women."
5,Best Coffee Ever,"I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that Britt is hands-down the best I've ever had. I brought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I can't go back to other bland store-bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed."
2,Nothing like his usual work; an unengaging read,"I know this won awards, but I didn't like it. I much prefer his Aurelio Zen character in several of his other books. This narrative consists entirely of letters written to a friend, so it's all first-person. I suppose it's clever, and if you're extremely fond of Robert Browning you might enjoy hearing him ""speak."" But other than those two things, I couldn't recommend it. It also violates a long-standing principal of mysteries concerning the narrator/main character. Can't give that away, but it's very disturbing!"
1,"Tedious, painfully boring, & not worth reading!","I have been a big fan of Dibdin for many years, but this one is best avoided. We are promised a ""truly astonishing final twist"" which turns out not worth the bother."
1,Sun Tzu would be ashamed. Horrible waste of time and money!,"Do not waste your time buying this. The production quality is awful. It has the worst sound of any DVD I have ever seen. It is a burnt CD that looks like someone made it on their PC. It is not professional at all. In fact, the copy I received wouldn't even play all the way through. It locked up 3 different DVD players to the point the power had to be turned off. This has no business being sold to anyone. In fact, the only DVD that I can even compare it to is the same companies ""Book of Five Rings"""
2,Utter nonsense,"Go no further than page 33, in the chapter on science, for why this is a terrible book. Markos (amazingly he has a PhD?) says evolution and the book of Genesis are both myths. Anyone who can make a statement like that needs to look up the definition of myth in the dictionary. Darwin and Freud have nothing in common, notwithstanding Markos' comparison. Darwin made testable predictions that turned out to be true, while Freud made unverifiable statements with no empirical evidence behind them. Markos needs to read a book on evolution.Markos says, (read page 54 carefully) that scientists reject miracles because of an a priori tendency to seek only natural causes. I would argue that the reason miracles are rejected by science is different. It is the application of Ockham's Razor to the question of miracles. It is simply more likely that the Gospels were written after 70 A.D. than Jesus magically foresaw the Temple's destruction. This book is extremely unconvincing."
5,Does Not Disappoint,"I've read so many books on Lewis, many of them disappointing, that I'm always wary when I begin a new one. I picked up Lewis Agonistes because of the promise in its subtitle--that I would gain insights from Lewis' work on how to relate truth to the postmodern world. Almost every Lewis reader understands that the great British writer's incisive logic and imagination effectively sliced through modern thought, but perhaps few consider how he also addresses the postmodern error. Markos did not disappoint me. His book demonstrates a rich understanding of Lewis' body of work and does an insightful job of showing how it refutes both modern and postmodern thinking. It's a fine addition to anyone's Lewis Library. -- Thomas Williams, author of The Heart of the Chronicles of Narnia and Knowing Aslan."
4,Lecture series more thorough,"I did enjoy this book but I found Dr Markos' lecture series ""The life and Writings of C.S. Lewis"" to be much richer as it covered so much more ground and it was wonderful to hear the enthusiasm that Markos has for Lewis' body of work. The CD lectures are available here on Amazon and I highly recommend them."
1,Mislabeled,"The heading says that this battery is ""for Panasonic 2.4GHZ and 5.8GHZ cordless Phones."" Well, maybe for some of them, but not for all of them, as it would not fit my TGA270S handset which is a 2.4GHZ Panasonic model. So make sure that your model is covered before you order this."
5,Excellent!,"The Cali Girl Beach Convertible is great. Mine is red like the one in the photo here which I think is good for the type of vehicle it is. Two dolls will fit in it and it also has seatbelts -- and that's a good way for kids to learn to wear them. It also has sunglasses and soda cans and the cans fit in the car. The back opens up and you can store the surfboards, too. It's very impressive, you won't be sorry if you buy this one."
1,Does Not Work on new Ford Escape.,"Purchased this kit for a 06 Ford Escape, after installing it the radio comes up with no sat. Called TERK of Audiovox, they no it doesn't work with late 05 and 06 models but don't have any solution to problem."
5,Works as advertised!,"Great product for a Sat-Ready head unit! Plug and play.. couldn't be easier. Works exactly as advertised and after 6 months, no problems to report."
4,Mercury Mariner,"This product was installed in my 2006 Mercury Mariner Premier. The radio code on the drivers door tag is 8. Sound quality is better than the FM modulator in our previous vehicle, but is certainly NOT CD quality. Good luck to anyone wanting to listen to XM Radio in their FLM vehicle."
1,Poor speaker Not worth seeing,"Greetings, I am an accountant and although I am not an expert in the economy, this video is poorly presented. There is a great deal of babbling and very little substance. The video is better describe as a commercial to promote a book but does not providing specifics on the underlining economic issues facing Americans today. Therefore, don't waste your money. You are better of seeing ""Collapse""."
4,My daughter loves it,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this van. She plays with it more then the dollhouse. It does cause a level of frustration. With a little help, she's off. The frustration comes from the dolls not fitting into the backseat. Although there is some frustration, she loves this van. It's one toy that is played with everyday."
3,Works for us,"Based on the other reviews, we had very low expectations when we purchased this. It seems we're having a better experience than the other reviewers. We had no trouble assembling it and it works just fine. We wanted a very basic swing and this is fulfilling that need."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this swing, thinking it wouldn't matter that it was the cheapest one available. I was wrong. As soon as I assembled it and turned it on, it never worked well. It barely swings, doesn't switch speeds consistently and then when I put my baby in it, it essentially doesn't move at all. I'll be returning it tomorrow."
5,Got to Get This and Do Tai Chi,"My back was sore towards my hips, and just doing the beginning stretches made it feel better! This video is easy to follow and goes step by step, plus does make you feel better ""soul"" wise and body wise. Buy this video if your a beginner or semi new to Tai Chi, the teacher is an expert in what he is doing, and I am already learning Tai Chi, feeling better, happier and relaxed, and healthier too! Totally worth the energy and time to watch Video, do the Tai Chi! I give Element: Tai Chi for Beginners an A+++ for awesomeness!"
2,Back ward video,"The video is backwords in the video the instructor moves his left arm and the video tells you to move your right arm all through out the whole video, so I e-mailed the Company and got a response back the all instructual videos are done that way, funny I have bought other instrutual videos and that is not the way they were done, sounds like a brush off to me, I will never buy another one of those videos again and will tell other people I talk to not to buy this video or any others by this comany."
5,Element: Tai Chi for Beginners,"Excellent. In the first part, Barnes immediately goes into teaching and modeling how to do the Tai Chi. His voice is soothing, he goes slowly enough that one can follow him, and he is thorough. Also, I like the background. Good for seniors or anyone who needs a cardiovascular workout. More fun than doing exercises which tire the body and produce nothing."
4,tai chi for Beginners,Easy to follow for someone who has never triedTai Chi.Some moves require a little practice but get easieras you continue to progress.
1,Hard to follow,This video was hard to follow especially when you are watching the movements and the narrator is telling you the oppisite of what you are seeing. Plus when I asked for a refund they said if it was opened there was no refund. How would I know about it if I did not watch the video?
4,"Relaxing, Well-Done, but Not a Snap to Learn","Element - Tai Chi for Beginners, by Samuel Barnes: This DVD is relaxing to use, is in a beautiful setting, and the instructor is knowledgeable. I'm pleased with the purchase, and find it to be a good choice and good value for the money. However, I was hoping for something very easy to learn. While not difficult to learn, I find I have to ""rewind"" to the steps a lot to be sure I'm doing each element correctly and to put the entire form together."
1,Not good for visual learners!,"I like the instructor, and the Qi Gong in the beginning is fine. However it went down hill from there. The instructor is performing in what is supposed to be a mirror image while the audio speaker explains the movements. This did not work for me as I am very visual and the instructor is moving his left body parts while the audio says to move your right. It would help if they explained that they were going to use the mirror effect which they don't. The confusion is compounded by the fact the the camera also changes angles adding to the confusion. If you ask me it should have been filmed using overhead angles so it would be easier to follow. I personally don't recommend it."
4,Beginner Tai Chi,"Completed a beginner Tai Chi class, but found my work schedule wouldn't permit a follow-up. This DVD has proved to be an excellent continuation. Qi Gong exercises at the beginning work on breathing, some balance, and stretching. Next section goes through beginner moves, naming them and performing them twice to help to remember them. Third section goes through whole routine uninterupted so learner can see the entire routine. Only one or two really strenuous moves, so good for elder crowd. Am enjoying this."
3,not easy to follow for seniors,We found this one not easy to follow. The explainations were not good and not co-ordinated and the breathing was not explained very well and not even. It may be all right for younger people but being seniors we found it difficult to follow.We needed simpler one at a time exercises. He runs a whole lot together. We just didn't like it very well and probably won't ever play it again. It was a waste of our money. We have another one called Fire & Water that we love by Matthew Cohen.
3,confusing workout video,"While this is a nice tai chi workout, its very confusing because the instructor speaks about using one side of the body while he using the opposite side. So if you have worked out with anyone before, his method is very difficult to follow. He really should use the same side of the body that he is speaking about, ie left, right..."
1,It's a fake...,"...Tai Chi video. It's NOT traditional Tai Chi. Heck the guy leading this video can barely balance on one leg. Do NOT buy it. Or, buy at your own risk, as you have been warned. LOL!"
3,fine for price,This is obviously a knock off. Beginning of video is missing and dvd makes some strange noises while playing. But for the price...
5,Tai Chi,I am really pleased with the DVD. I received it more quickly than I expected and I am more than pleased with the quality of the product. thank you so much. I will definitely use this site as my regular go to place.
5,"PEACE and RELAXATION! Oh, yeah....","I'm a total newbie to Taichi and now I'm hooked thanks to this DVD.I get SO relaxed as I'm doing each exercise and afterwards, man, the world can blow up and I wouldn't notice.Inhale....exhale.... this is what everyone needs to wind down and feel serene.I read a few other reviews where they said that it's not easy to follow along because he's facing the camera and it gets confusing....What? How hard is it to mirror what he's doing? Not hard at all!I never get confused and I follow along EASY, and the pace is perfect.I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn TaiChi for the first time or who just wants to learn how to relax and wants a good basic no frills routine that's clear, simple and works.Worth it!"
3,"It's Okay, if you have already had knowledge of movements","I bought this video for my mom. I decided to try it out first, to see if it would be okay for her to start with. This video assumes you know some Tai Chi, or something as he did not go through the movements before he started doing them. He was going slow, so you can figure it out.. but I would have liked a little more direction on how to do the move correctly, or even what the name of the move was. Id get it if you know the basics of Tai Chi and want another slower/beginner type video. If you have never done Tai Chi before, I'd maybe look for something else, if you are like me and prefer a little direction initially.If you pickup things quick and can mimic, then this video is for you."
5,thumbs up!,I've always loved this movie since I was too young to understand it. I truly just wanted the physical copy in my possession and I got it!:-D
4,Exciting!,If you are a fan of The Wire you would love this movie. I like the actors that played in this movie .
3,DVD Purchase-Paid in Full Review,"The movie was purchased November 11, 2010. The movie arrived to my address the third week of December. It was sold to be new, but you could clearly tell that the movie was used becaue of the scratches on the back of the DVD. But it plays ok."
1,DVD wouldn't play after a certain part,DVD was good until I reached the middle of the movie and it wouldn't play anymore.I tried to skip pass it with no luck
4,Good flick.,"Not quite 5 stars because it's not at the same level as let's say Scarface, The Untouchables or some other similar action drama gangster flick but still highly enjoyable. Had to own this after watching it for some time on Netflix and not wanting to depend on a network connection."
2,Paid In Full,"I watched this movie because Mekhi Phifer was in it,now I wish I hadn't.Rent or buy one of his other movies instead."
2,"Decent, but not Great","The Cast of this film made for the Decent. Although the Acting was not as such. The storyline could use a little help, but all in all, it deserves to be mentioned with the few good ""Gangsta"" movies that have come out."
1,Paid in full,I was sent a bootleg copy it did'nt not play in my DVD player.Very Very Very Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Classic Gangsters,"My fascination with gangsters on film continues. In Paid In Full, the most telling scene is the Harlem young people in a movie theatre watching Al Pacino's, Scarface. They love that movie, cheer the crazy, bloodthirsty, self-made, only-in-America bad guy. When poor and black Harlem residents get a handle on the new drugs in the early eighties like cocaine and crack, money rains down. Wood Harris goes from delivery boy to kingpin of the Harlem drug trade. His buddies are more flamboyant than he. That youthful enthusiasm for easy money in the face of ""The Man,"" proves to be our hero's downfall. This is a classic gangster story and it is very suspenseful and true to life."
4,"very entertaining, based on a true story","A well made movie about a young kid who finds himself right in the middle of a money making drug ring. This young man works at a dry cleaner shop untill he finds a bag of cocain in a pair of pants, when he trys to give the bag back to the owner he realizes the money he could make and soon sets up shop with this and begins buying large amounts of cocain from him. What started small has now grown into pounds,and pounds of cocain. But people soon become blinded by all the money this is where the movie gets interesting. The ring quickly begins to fall apart and people begin to tur on each other leaving people dead and broke. This movie is a real masterpiece and gives you a look into 80's drug dealing and the problems involved with it."
4,Gangsta Painted with Love,"In a mood that deemphasizes the sex and violence in favor of the moral cost of the drug trade, this film has the easygoing persona of a soap opera with a bite that hits you afterwards."
3,da song track 2 paid in full is hard,i love da song track 2 paid in full it has camron master p and da whole diplomacs on da track da beat of da song is crazy and master p finally did something different besides always allowing his song to use other people's hits in da past da song track of paid in full shows da highlight clips of da film and da sights of harlem i may not understand da lyrics from all da rappers in da song but i no i like da beat it is one of my favorite beat songs i heard in a while when i just heard this song i played it as much as 10 times i da middle of da night and it was on a school night and while in school i couldn't really focus on my class assignments but it was worth it not i'll never do that again because my teacher saw me day dream in da classroom and she told my parents that i wasn't doing well in class today and that was it u no what happened i got whipped Joe Brown
5,Unparalleled among self-help books!,"You can throw all your other self-help books away-Self-Worth Now! is the only one you will ever need. Selby has written a fascinating and intimate account of self-hate; where it comes from, and how to get rid of it. Full of courage and humor, this is the only book I ever read that makes you feel GOOD to be a human being. The amazing final chapter is worth the price of the book alone. Do yourself-and the people you care about-a favor; buy this book."
3,"In the beginning, boring...then picks up","But very epetitive, as much as from one paragraph to the next. And I got lost with so many names in the beginning that it was hard to remember who everyone was.NOT his best work"
1,Too much fluff,"This is a tragic story that deserves to be told. I don't care for the author's writing style at all. New chapters every 2nd page, 1 entire page wasted on the new chapters. (1/2 on the old, 1/2 on the new) Some of the information is repetitive and in all honesty, the story could have been told in 150 pages or so. I don't recommend this book."
2,"A Brutal Murder, But Primarily of Local Interest","I purchased this book because of the local notoriety, but more so because I had met the Bryant's on a couple social occasions. The book did not get much into their personalities or interviews with families or friends. Most of the information was available locally. In person, both Bryant's gave the impression of being meek and laid back. Neither would ever give you the impression of the parts they would eventually come to play."
4,Back From Betrayal,this is a good book because it gives insight into the betrayer. It shows the amount of deep issues they have. You can substitutesex addiction and alcoholism if you need to. It does talk a lot about sex addiction but anyone who has affairs is hiding other issues.This books lets the betrayed sees its not about them.
1,BAD!,"They're trying to act like a little corny kid-band version of B.E.P. They really do suck. But I kinda like ""Flip"""
2,T-Sqaud: Worst of 2007,"Disney Records had an amazing year in 2006 with the mega sale of the phenomenon ""High School Musical"", which sold 4,000,000 copies in the U.S., and ""The Cheetah Girls 2"", selling 1,500,000, also the unexpected ""Hannah Montana"", nearly selling 3,000,000 copies. Now, T-Squad is a bad presentation for young kids, there a wannabe Black Eyed Peas. They do have a hit song ""Flip"" (which is ok) that is playing numerously on the Disney Channel, and doing well on Radio Disney. But for the rest of this debut, it is bad. Songs like ""Vertical"", ""Graduation"", and more are just terrible. They need to spend some more time in the studio, actually, how did they get signed?"
1,PO-SER,"Okay, some of their songs are okay, such as vertical and second star to the right. A song that i really hate is Flip. The blonde girl ruins it all! She just seems like such a poser. The song really isn't that bad, the boy (the one with the spikey black hair) is actually kinda cute. How old is he anyway? Whenever i hear flip or see it on disneychannel,i just turn it off, her voice is just so annoying! The other girl can actually sing. Rrrrrrrrrr, she just makes me mad whenever i hear her voice. So that's my opinion. Anybody agree?"
5,captive star,Nora Roberts fans should read this serious and any book she wrights since she places you as the read right into the middle of the action.
5,Amazing Read,AFTER reading Hidden Star I just had to read this book and can not wait to read Secret Star. Nora Roberts is the best.
4,Enjoyment,I am a big fan of Nora Roberts and enjoyed this book. The personal relationships are entertaining and have a positive note. I really enjoyed this series.
5,Great transaction!,"The item was received before the deadline and in good condition. I have ordered other items from Amazon.com and they are great! I love Amazon.com!!!!!!!! I used to go thru ebay a lot but now I go to Amazon because it is easier and a lot of times cheaper. I have also known people who have gotten bad deals thru ebay-everyone I know that deals with Amazon loves it, including me."
2,Not if you're looking for non-rape-y undertones in your romance,"I was really disappointed with this one. I don't read ""trashy"" romance novels because they're so- well, trashy- but in past books Ms. Roberts has proven she can spin a yarn which manages to be entertaining and full of steamy romance without using words that make you want to wash your brain out with soap.That said I have a problem with the ""he tied me up and could have raped me, and I thought he was really hot so I kind of wanted him to, but he didn't so now we're going to fall in love"" plot line. The heroine is supposed to be a bad-ass tough girl, but comes off more like an emotionally unhinged mental patient who seriously flirts with rape fantasies.Out of respect for her writing style I'm giving this a two- otherwise, it would be a one all the way."
4,captive for the night,"I was completely enticed theEntire night. I didn't make dinner it was so interesting. My family had left over spaghetti and corn, while mama had a little “me"" time. This is my first time reading thisWriter."
4,Little mystery/little romance,"I enjoy Nora Roberts, mystery/romance, and trilogies. This book fit all three, so it was very enjoyable. I would recommend the trilogy for relaxing reading."
1,small ss giraffe earrings,The earrings are minute! I didn't realize they were that tiny! I would have preferred a little bigger. I thought they would be as big as the picture shown.
5,Impossibly wonderful,"First understand that Buchbinder is a Beethoven scholar. It is important that you look at the documentary to understand how he developed his mastery of Beethoven. It is impossible that he conducted and played these 5 concertos in a four day period without breaking a sweat. His technique is amazing. The Vienna philharmonic is of course wonderful as they were in the Beethoven symphonies conducted by Christian Thieleman. Sound quality, picture quality and directing of film are impeccable. It just does not get any better than this."
4,No track menu,"Don't buy this unless you really love this performance. There is no menu for you to select a particular track. For example, if you wanted to hear the second movement to the 4th concerto, you have to keep advancing the tracks. Major annoyance.Update: A fellow Amazon person helped figure it out. Yes, I can select particular concertos and movements. Gotta add some stars."
5,History Channel is Great!,Fantastic!! Covers the history of the pioneers to Modern ships. Educational and fun at the same time. You can't go wrong with the History Channel!
1,A BIG (BLOCK) DISAPPOINTMENT,"Well one of the other reviewers is 100percent right. While full of technical info, the book is WAY OUTDATED. Many of the GM parts listed are no longer available, there is no mention of GM Perforamnce Parts engines, or the GEN V and GEN VI big blocks since this book was written in the 70's, and as mentioned by someone else here, claims aftermarket parts are usually inferior. Not true today. The book should be updated at a minimum. A nice read if you are restoring an old Vette or Chevy. But if you are looking to build a modern big block, look elsewhere."
2,How To Hot Rod Your Big Block Chevy,"This book may have been useful 20 years ago when aftermarket parts were hard to come by for big blocks. Today, aftermarket parts come in a wide variety with multiple buying options such as Craig's list and Ebay and various internet sites. This book is more about swapping factory GM parts which is something that is probably harder to do and more expensive today than it was 30 years ago. What the book does have is good general information about big blocks and any information has value. How to Rebuild Your Big Block Chevy is a better book."
3,Good book,"Very informative, but very old school, could use newer technology, such as with cylinder heads, and camshaft grinds, crankshafts, rods, pistons. But if you're building on a budget, this book is a good source."
1,"Now Organic Sucanut, powdered",I was very disappointed because I ordered powdered sucanut and I received granular! I could have purchased this at my local Health Food Store and saved on shipping!
4,Great sociological study of a modern millenarian group.,"For anyone interested in the psychology and group dynamics of millenarian/prophetic groups, this book is essential reading. Sometime in the late 1950s or early 1960s the authors stumbled upon and infiltrated a group based on a prediction of imminent world destruction. When the prediction failed (after all, we are all still here in the late 1990s), the group underwent a severe crisis. This study details how that crisis developed and was resolved, drawing from it some general ideas about how groups based on prophecies survive the failure of those prophecies."
4,Perfect Blanket,"My only regret is that I didn't buy this product at the beginning of the summer. I love it for the brief summer month i have been able to use it though. It is perfect for going to the park or even the beach. It's very comfortable and easy to wash. If you love the outdoors, I suggest getting it. Besides, it was one of the cheapest brands I could find. Good buy."
2,The two layers are not connected and whoever stand slips,The layers are not connected although it looks they are on the photo.It is not safe to use it especially with children.The fabric is good. So I'll end up sewing the two layers.But it is very unclear how this thing sells so good.First time you stand on it you feel unstable.
3,"Good Blanket, not so much on the bag","I do love the size of the blanket and color. However, folding it back up to make it look like the picture again is pretty much impossible. Basically I just carry the blanket around and dont worry about the bag"
3,"Nice color & size, but not comfortable",The size is perfect for a lot of kids and adults. but it's not sturdy. I could feel the bumps on the grass & sand. Not very comfortable. and the hem is getting undone. I have to re-sew it.
4,Cute Pattern,"This blanket is really cute but not quite as durable as I was hoping for. It's a good value for the price however, and I do recommend it."
3,Great mat; poor case construction,"Pros:Great water resistant/kid tough material.Large size.Great colors.Light weight.Washable.Does not collect sand.Cons:Inconvenient carrying case that is not attached to mat.Even if mat is rolled into smaller size, the loose case is useless."
3,Good blanket for the money,"This blanket really protects against wet ground and is a great size for two adults and a kid. The padding is pretty thin but provide some comfort against rocks and roots. Too much more padding would make it bulkier to carry. Also, some of the threading along the trim is already coming out. It is a bit akward to put back into its bag but for the cost, I'm completely satisfied and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton."
5,Served its purpose!,"I needed to get a nice big picnic blanket ASAP recently and noticed overall positive reviews for this one. One of the perks of this blanket is definitely its size. Myself, my husband and son were able to fit comfortably in it without touching grass or dirt. There was even enough space for my 9-month old to crawl around a bit. I would definitely enjoy it more if it had just a tad more cushion but that was the least of worries. All of the dirt and grass that got on it was easily flung away once I started packing it up. I still need to get used to how to fold it properly but, again, the pros outweigh the cons for me. I would totally recommend this blanket to anyone looking for a nice sized one!"
4,"Happy with purchase, could be improved.","Other people were not exaggerating when they said this blanket was too thin. It was ok for use on the grass, but it really could be padded more for a cushier picnic. Also, for how thin it is, I was surprised at how big it is supposed to be folded into the storage bag. I actually folded it smaller so it would fit easier into my car for storage and just have the straps that hold it together hanging from the bag. I'm going to cut the straps and pin or stitch them together because the bag really is too big and not practical. Besides these two issues, I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again and/or recommend it. It was a good purchase for the price and size of the blanket."
3,good blanket but...,"okay blanket but... they missed a huge opportunity to make the carrying case built in. the carrying case they provide is a little clumsyi'm going to take mine blanket, sew some straps directly onto the blanket (with velcro on the back) so i can fold it, then roll it, then just velcro it closed. (sort of like a sleeping bag. at least like my sleeping bag)i would hope the next version would include this. (and send me a free one for suggesting the idea! :)"
4,Outdoor blanket,Great for outside or on hard floors for babies inside; could be a little bigger but is easy to tote around and convenient
1,extemely unhappy,"Unfortunately, I did not have a very good experience with this order. I wanted the color striped blanket, but received the denim. I returned the blanket and ordered another one. The next one I received had a different backing and was extremely slippery. My neighbor was carrying her baby and stepped on the blanket and almost fell!!!! I returned that one as well and have decided this is not the product for me or my family."
5,Great for festivals!,"I got the colorful striped version of this blanket and it was a great size for an outdoor music festival this weekend. With an equally colorful beach towel for a little extra room, this gave ample space for three adults to lounge in comfort. The plastic/waterproof backing of this blanket did not make it hot or anything, and it protected us from any water seeping through to us.I see some reviews stating these don't launder well. I've not laundered mine yet, but it seems very well made. I will wash it in cold on delicate and probably hang it dry and I do not anticipate having a problem.The carrying case is really good too - has a couple pockets on it for your water bottles."
1,Slip and fall hazard,"Took this out and layed it on the carpeted living room floor to test it. My 1 yr old took one step and her foot shot forward so fast she landed on the back of her head. Thank goodness we were on the soft floor. The top padded cloth portion of this blanket is not connected to the bottom water resistant portion except on the sides. This means the top slips and slides with the slightest touch over the bottom. And it slides fast! Not safe for small children, as they usually step on blankets before sitting down. My 4 yr old slipped, but didn't fall down. Why chance it? Took it outside to see if being on grass made any difference, but no. It still slipped all over the place, therefore also causing the blanket to not stay flat if you plan to move at all while you are on it. I don't know why other reviewers like this blanket so much. Mine's going back. Too dangerous."
4,Handy-dandy blanket,"After visiting with 2 other mommies that had Tuffos, I decided to purchase one for our burgeoning family---Supercool! Lightweight, waterproof, many choices with pattern, love the carry strap thing. Kind of wish the straps were part of the blanket itself, but I understand that it would compromise the waterproof backing. Be careful when pulling off the mfc tag, can tear the stiches!Great product overall, we think!MauiMommie232"
1,"Not worth money, get something different!!!!","I took this blanket to the beach. When we got up the ladybugs were printed everywhere on our bodies. when it gets wet, it sheds. After first laundry the leaves and ladybugs are mixed up and this blanket looks like a hell. For this money you can get a better product."
2,non--waterproof,"If you want water resistant or waterproof look to the Turfer blanket, instead of the Tuffo picnic blanket. This 1 is slippery and certainly not waterproof."
1,NOT a FTG blade as advertised,"Bosch CB1060L is NOT a FTG (flat top grind) blade. Check the Bosch website if you don't believe me.... I ordered this blade specifically for the FTG grind as I need to cut splines into picture frames. These require flat teeth...My complaint is not about the blade itself. I am sure it is a good blade for the intended purpose..... But I am very disappointed that Amazon has not changed the description even though I have pointed out the incorrect and misleading information when I returned mine....If you are looking for a true FTG blade, look for the Freud LM72R010 or LM72M010.... I found LM72R010 at a local shop and it IS a true FTG grind.In case you are curious... CB1060L is a 'TRI' grind: consecutive teeth are left top - right top - flat top - left top - right top - flat top- etc..."
4,Wonderful Movies,"I had the pleasure of viewing the movies when they were presented on the CBS network; and when I saw that they were finally available in DVD format, I was happy. The movies portray a very good reunion for both the people of Colorado Springs and the family in Boston. We get to see the children growing up pursuing their own interests. It makes you want them to make more movies so you can see what else they will be doing in their future."
1,I WANT A REFUND AND RETURN ITEM,"I purchased this movie because Amazon recommended it as I bought the ""complete series set"" of ""Dr Quinn Medicine Woman"".What Amazon didn't mention was that the complete series I purchased already came with the two Dr Quinn Medicine Woman movies as part of that set. So I have bought it twice.I am of very poor health, cannot work and money is very scarce. This was purchased for me for Christmas and it was money we couln't afford but my wife thought it was extra and recommended by Amazon.We would certainly not have bought it if we knew it was already in the complete Dr Quinn Series Set.I am extremely displeased to say the least.I want to return the DVD as soon as possible.I want a refund.The DVD is in it's original packaging, unopened, sealed.I would appreciate communication asap please."
4,Dr. Quinn fan,"If you are a big Dr. Quinn fan, as I am, you will like this DVD. ""The Heart Within"" picks up where the series left off and you get to see the children all grown up. It also takes us back to Boston and Dr. Quinn's very outspoken mother. It a must have for your collection."
4,Family Adventure,These movies were as heartwarming to watch as the original tv series and filled with wonderful morals that you'd want your children to share with their own someday. Each movie has the gorgeous scenery of the West and the old world charm of the East. I would highly reccommend it on it's values and Family viewing.
4,Good quality show,"I have been watching Dr.Quinn Medicine Woman on GMC. But wanted to have it on DVD. So I could watch when I wanted, without alot commericals. It was a good show. The price I got it for at Amazon.com was so good I couldn't pass it up. You get all six seasons of Dr.Quinn and the two movies. I have enjoy hours of quality show."
3,Dr. Quinn Movies,"Package was delivered in a timely fashion. Only complaint is the quality of the DVD, it has a grainy picture. Could be issues with the manufacturer."
5,Morning workout,I enjoy this tape very much and have found it very helpful in beginning to learn how to belly dance. I also enjoy the Goddess imagery used throughout. Its a great way to streatch out the kinks and get ready to face the work day.
4,Review of Belly Dance Instruction tape,"Beautiful, professional and easy to follow . I appreciate how much you got into one video."
3,"Competent, but not up to their usual standard.","Compared with the shimmering dub and sampledelic landscapes of their previous albums, Tarwater's latest is something of a lacklustre disappointment. In fact, precious little of their trademark hypnotic basslines remain and the music is reduced to fairly standard synthetic techno. The album is still a cut above most releases and some of the tracks have glimpses of Tarwater magic, but overall it's a less engaging and more sterile offering. First check out ""Silur"", then ""11/6, 12/10"" and finally move on to this album as a last resort."
2,boring music is still boring,"Lethargic, detatched spoken vocals over drab, uninteresting tracks, sound good? Knock yourself out. I don't know what you might call compelling on this thing. Certainly not the melodies (god forbid), or the lyrics or the 'atmosphere'. This record practically defies you to pay attention to it, or to remember anything about it once it ends. Maybe it's the sobriety talking, but this is [boring]"
4,Soap,Was supprised that they shipped two separate boxes because all the items could fit into one with room to spare. Otherwise was very pleased with order.
3,It's ok,Got this as a gift for My girlfriend for xmas. she has been in the lifestyle most of her life and knows quite a bit of it. But I thought she would enjoy it just the same
4,Starter book,"I was interested in finding out more about this subject matter. I guess if this is what you are into it would be a great book. I did not find it to be what I was looking for, information wise."
3,It was okay,"I found this book to be well written from a literary point of view. The dialog and secondary characters were delightful. And if you like a lot of historical facts this is the book for you. However, Joanna is such a snot and so ungratful that at times it is hard to get past a personal irritation toward her and enjoy the book. I would love to read more by this author if the rest of her heroiens are not so nasty."
3,Not the best overall but has some hot tracks,Not the best compilation cd. I think the artist are not mainstream. However several standout 4 star songs off this cd are really good.Lord Jay & Mahoma (Saquen los Fules); Savour (Solamente Tu); J. Nuex; Kriya Shakyi (Se Activan los Maleantes); Wasn't really feeling the girls raps on here with the exception of Cielo (Ten Cuidado) I was searching the net to see if she had more stuff but guess not. Kaz (Vamos a Formar Este Tripeo)is good & Corly Gunz; D-Gurly (Con Quien Sea).
5,A Family Favorite,"Our whole family loves the Case Closed series. This was a great set because there were many episodes that we did not get to see before. Each time, the first time through, it's always exciting to try and guess the outcome. Some of these had me stumped and my sons too. This was a birthday present for my younger son Brad; Good Pick! We're ready for Season 5!"
4,Protecting Your Financial Security,"The book shares some good advice and some of the situations you may encounter. This was very helpful, but no book can anticipate the problematic financial situations one may encounter in their individual divorce. There are situations in which you face not only an unpleasant situation, but the negative, dark side of human nature...in your mate and yourself!"
2,Complicated and confusing,"This book has some good fundamental information but it is wrapped around a lot of confusing topics making it very difficult to use. There was one chapter I was most interested in - retirement accounts and 401k's however, this chapter was short and did not give me any more information than I could have gotten over the internet."
3,Nice cover,"I had previously written that this item had no pocket into which I could put my duvet. Low and behold, this morning I decided to check once more and found some lumps in the fabric - turns out they were buttons closing the pocket. Now I am back in business and I wont have make a return.The fabric is indeed suede-like. One side of the cover anyway. The back face is decidedly not as nice, but it is acceptable. Hopefully the back will dry as fast when I wash it. Fast drying is a nice feature of the microfiber fabric!I would pump up the stars to four or five if I had any way to do so."
4,great duvet set,"this duvet is very lightweight, so it doesn't take away from the fluffiness of the duvet itself. Also it is very nice when you have cats, the micro suede repels cat hair very well, all you have to do it vaccumm or 'roll' and the cat hair comes right off, it doesn't weave itself into the fabric (those of you with cats know exactly what i mean!) and when you wash it, it looks brand new again. I was afraid it would show and be ruined by cat claws, but it stands up very well....so far i can't find one claw mark. the underside is like a satin/silk material....very nice. All in all a great duvet cover set as I have been looking for a long time for very specific things (mainly cat resistant) and I seem to have found it. I wouldn't say the original price of 140.00$ is what it's worth, but definitely 29.99 is a steal!"
2,Inaccurate Color Description,"The ""Olive"" is ""Sage"" - much lighter than the picture.It will not work for you if you are really looking for Olive."
4,Awesssommmee!!!,"My duvet arrived quickly and has not let me down! It is sooo soft! My comforter fits neatly inside. There is a little extra room, but its nothing too serious since it stays put inside the duvet. It's a perfect fit for my double pillowtop mattress. I refuse to let my cat sit on it though because I can imagine her hair being a pain to remove."
4,good value,"good value for the price. purchased this for my college son's room at home. he really loved the fabric. i noticed it faded a little onto the sheets. i would recommend washing first before using. looks great, i purchased a king for his queen sized bed and the fit is perfect. love the shams too."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this purchase. One that I bought from LNT last year was much nicer and about the same price. Not everything on here is a great bargain. If, as they say, it sounds too good to be true, it probably is."
1,sucks,"I am not happy with the product ,first of all it came after 2 months and i didnt like the quality at all ,can i send it back."
3,Not good.,"That I have received at all does not correspond to my expectation. Colour not a brick, it is faster, a cherry. But it not all problem. In the name it is told, the Duvet set, to what it? If recently in the review I have not read that it only the set of covers, I would be disappointed not slightly, and is very strong. I can not return, it is too expensive. It would be desirable, that the seller precisely specified that he sells. I have a feeling that me have inflated."
2,NOT SO HAPPY!,"FIRST OFF IT IS NOT CARMEL AS DESCRIBED, IS MORE LIKE A CHOCOLATE COLOR. LOOKS WAY BETTER ONLINE THEN IN PERSON. THE MATERIAL FEELS EXTREMELY CHEAP BUT HEY I SHOULD OF KNOWN BETTER YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
2,Kinda Junky,"The set feels cheap. I should have known, I got what I paid for. It looks a lot nicer than it feels."
1,safety pins,I really do love the color and idea of suede HOWEVER my boyfriend and I have had to safety pin the end after a short lived button attachment. (broke off or too loose) So very ugly.
2,Not Exactly What You Think,"This product is not suede as mention, but it is a micro-fiber product with a faux-pas appearance and feel of suede. It feels like cheap and fake 99cent suede. It's not bad material but I prefer the comfort of suede over the appearance of suede. so I returned it and got some nice Egyptian cotton bedding from a Linen'N'Things store. Color was much darker compared to the picture. Do not buy your bedding online, especially from unfamiliar brand because you do not know the product's quality. I suggest getting your bedding at a store even though it will be a little more expensive then online, but you should put a price on your comfort."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Received my chocolate duvet set a week ago. I think it is worth about 10 bucks.There is no substance, just thin flimsy material. I read a review that it faded, so I washed it and it did fade a bit. It must have shrunk because my comforter is too big and is now bunched up inside the duvet.I did like the look of the chocolate suede in my bed room.Last night I found that it was hard to keep on the bed. The bottom lining is a taffeta and slide, slide, slide all over the place. I woke up this morning with two thirds of it in the floor. My bed has no foot board, but good luck keeping it where you want it.Mine will slide on over to GoodWill donation box."
4,microsuede duvet,I love my duvuet set. Well worth the price. It's soft & comfortable. I'm considering getting it in other colors.
4,This was a really good buy.,This duvet cover and sham was really a good buy. I looked at several stores and web sites before purchasing this and could not find a better price. The size and quality were quite good for the money. I was a little leary but was pleasantly suprised. I am learning to shop Amazon first.
4,fine for the money,"Good quality for price. There are no corner ties, but I figure for the price I can sew them in."
1,STATIC ELECTRICITY!!,"Has anyone had problems with static electricity in the comforter? Upon taking the comforter out of the bag, it was loaded up with static, i sprayed it down but to no avail.... Ive even tried washing it, any suggestions?"
4,Nice but not great,"This duvet set is pretty nice. The microsuede is soft and feels great. The product description doesn't mention that the microsuede only covers half of the duvet and the shams. The back of each is just a straight polyester fabric. Not a big deal, I just didn't know that going in. I haven't washed it yet, so I'll have to see how that goes."
3,color blind,"this set is nice, if your not too particular about colors. I bought 2 in camel, just got them today, and they are not camel as shown in the listing. they are brown. brown, brown, brownest of brown. thought they may have mistankenly sent me the chocolate color, but even the package states color as camel. however unlike the camel color shown in the listing a very light, cream shade, what i received is nowhere near that color. so beware, color examples of the microsuede duvet set offered by blue ridge home fashions are not necessarily what your going to receive."
3,On the fence...,"I read through most of the reviews on Amazon before purchasing this duvet. Keeping in mind that I didn't even know what a duvet was before the ""female touch"" enlightened me, I was pleasantly surprised with the look and feel. I ordered the camel color, and unlike others who received chocolate, I got the color I ordered. However, the duvet feels incredibly thin, making me think I should have paid $20 instead of $30 for it. But for $30 and free shipping, I have no complaints...except for the fact that my comforter keeps shifting to one side and ends up having none on the other. Maybe I'm missing something here, but it's frustrating to end up cold in the middle of the night because my side of the duvet doesn't have any comforter in it."
4,A title for review.,"Product came as it looks in add. Recommend doing a wash by itself before washing with other products, as so colour leaks first time. The felty side is only for display and is not under the duvet."
5,I like this Duvet set,"This Duvet set is really soft , I love it . It fit perfect with my king comforter. It worth the price ."
2,Product received was not even close to the color advertised (Camel),"I ordered this in Camel but the color that arrived was INFINITELY darker than pictured - it is a very deep brown (the label on the item indicates ""Camel"" so they did not send me the wrong one). I'm disappointed. if I wanted a deep brown I would have ordered the chocolate. Please take note if you are looking into the Camel color."
2,Not really washable!,"Buyer beware...even though the description says washer & dryer safe, the actual tag says ""Dry Cleaning Recommended"". I haven't had to wash it yet but it has me concerned for when I do."
3,These are OK.,"This set did not include ties on the corners so my comforter just moved all around. Also the backside is just slippery polyester of some sort. Not a terrible product, but not fantastic either."
4,Makes You Think...,"Against a backdrop of scientific breakthroughs and political oppression McCarthy manages to create an imaginative, if paranoid, look at the near future. Nanotechnology is no longer just a buzz word but an everyday element of life, though not truly understood by the average citizen. This makes the perfect breeding ground for shadow conspiracies. All in all Solid State makes for good, fast paced read that really makes you think."
3,adequate airport read.,"Not bad but gets 3 stars only by airport standards. The first part of the book is alright and Bowser is a rather appealing character. Unfortunately after Bowser leaves the stage the book simply plods along. If you want a cyber novel read Trouble and her Friends by Melissa Scott, it's a much better book."
4,Mapie: La Cuisine De France,"I've had and used this cookbook for 30 years. Now tattered, I'm buying a replacement. The recipes wonderfully reliable and remarkably straightforward."
5,I remember,"I was one of those Vietnem vets who endured the effects of Jane Fonda's and John Kerry's treasonous diatribe. I returned from Vietnam and using my GI bill, I started college at a major university. I bought an old car with $300 I had saved and my fellow students, discovering I was a Vietnem vet, spray-painted ""baby killer"" on my car. While in Vietnam, I donated much of my off time, along with several fellow vets, repairing an overcrowded orphanage, playing with the dozen's of children starving for attention, and raising donations back home from family and friends.How can anyone who didn't experience what we experienced understand. Even worse, how can they criticize these genuine American heros who suffered so much.Were Kerry and Fonda guilty? Indeed they were as were many others."
1,I'm in Afghanistan,"I'm serving right now in Afghanistan, and you know what? I think when I retire from the army I'll go around trying to get free stuff from people by saying ""I fought for this country, how dare you!"" , sorry folks but it's pathetic to blame someone who faught in the war but later protested it, it's even more cowardly to use your veteran status to initiate more war. I fail to see how Kerry is to blame because some disturbed NVA/Vietcong jailers tortured people. Are you saying that if there were no protesters they would have been treated well? Get real! Later, I need to do some heroics so that I can get free stuff by spewing out how ""I faught for this country"" and everyone else owes me now."
1,"pathetic attempt...too little, too late.","This is a ridiculous attempt to discredit the one candidate who actually did volunteer for service overseas, and who faced enemy combat...to help the lying chimp who was at the least AWOL during that time, if not a deserter in wartime. May it never reach the airwaves!"
1,"""Stolen Honor""",Stolen Honor tries to blame John Kerry for prolonging the Vietnam war and causing POWs to suffer. In fact John Kerry spoke the truth in his testimony before congress. Those soldiers like John Kerry who were not afraid to tell the truth actually caused the war to end sooner. This film is a lame attempt by supporters of George Bush to cast doubt on a true brave American John Kerry.
2,I am chastened,"You make a good point, except that I would caution you not to blame my publisher for 200 pages of padding; it was my fault, not theirs. Anyway, thanks for commenting; if you're willing to take the time to levy specific complaints, I'd be very interested. Jordan"
1,Rocky Point Gringo Guide,Don't bother with this book. I bought it as a gift for a relative who was going to Rocky Point for a vacation. However the book was written so poorly and so long ago that it was totally and utterly useless. I went ahead and gave it to the relative as a joke.Gladys Love
5,muscle cars,great book! lots of fun to reminisce about the good old days. almost a history lesson that i actually remember.
