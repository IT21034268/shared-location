4,Invaluable part of your survival library,"An informative and enjoyable read. If you could have only one wilderness survival book, this is the one to buy."
2,"SOME good, but there's better out there.","This book has SOME good info in it but you have to read past a lot of make believe Indian Jedi-Master garbage. ""Stalking Wolf,"" his supposed childhood mentor, clutters the first half of the book with unbelieveable tripe like apologizing to fish & his ""brothers the thistles"",(no, I'm not making this up). It's funny after being raised by this ""Indian Scout,"" as he calls him, & going on & on about him, Brown suddenly drops the whole Hollywood Indian nature lover approach and then doesn't even mention his ""Messiah"" again, even in the ""Acknowledgements""??? What? I smell a fairy-tale. Get a copy of Wisemans ""SAS Survival Handbook"" instead, his stuff stands on it's own."
5,Don't leave home without it!,This is an great book with tons of useful information. It will explain your priorities if a survival situation and tells you almost everything you will need to survive in any environment. The chapter on edible plants is intended as an overview and even Tom Brown himself recommends supplementing it with other books. This is the first book you'll want to get if you want to learn wilderness survival skills.
2,Original was better,"I returned this book after briefly thumbing through it. The subject matter is almost identical to Larry Dean Olsen's ""Outdoor Survival Skills"". In particular many of the drawings are renderings of the exact same photos in Larry's book.Perhaps the authors worked together; if not, is is a shameless copy of the earlier book."
5,gave me the essentials i would need to survive outdoors,"This book teaches you about all that you need to know about outdoor survival. but, a book that was better than this was outdoor survival skills by Larry Dean Olsen. There was much more information in this book and it taught me a lot of more seful things that you could use in the wilderness which i have tested and they work. I would refer this book to the people that go to look at Tom Browns book."
5,"FORGET ""DELLA'","LISTEN TO THE ARRANGEMENTS AND CONDUCTING THE ORCHESTRA BY ""NEAL HEFTI."" Without him, Della would be NOTHING!!!!"
5,Fabulous,"I went from a regular old wooden pin to this one for rolling out my fondant. Was a great upgrade. Nothing sticks to it, easy to clean. The red is nice as well. I bought rings for it and those works well also."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"I'm not happy with this rolling pin because I use it for rolling out bread dough. The dough did stick & took me a lot longer then my old fashioned wood rolling pin. Also, hard on the hands."
3,"Works well, but really needs handles.","This product works well and does a good job, but the lack of off-set handles on the sides make it difficult to use to its best potential. Fiesta's ""Traditional"" version is spot on, however."
2,Rolling Pin is not black,"I haven't used my rolling pin yet, so can not comment on how it performs. However, when I received my rolling pin, to my surprise it was red. I called the supplier, and they said that the manufacturers no longer offers the black rolling pin and that the color would be random. Disappointing, I must say as all my silicone bakeware is black."
1,Terrible product,"When I bought this in November 2009 I thought that I would get lifelong performance for the $32.99, but I was dead wrong. This product has a silicone sleeve over a solid plastic center. Within seven months the sleeve developed a split along nine inches of it's length It was rendered useless!The claim that the silicone rolling pin would be easier to keep clean than a wood pin also proved incorrect. A wood pin is absolutely no harder to keep clean, and is a boatload cheaper.Instead, go to Bed Bath and Beyond and buy their $[...] rock maple french rolling pin (see it at [...]). Not only will this last for my lifetime, but will probably serve generations to come - there is nothing to wear out!!"
1,The worst book in graph theory,"I have found this book difficult to read because of its lack of examples and theorems.Many famous examples and theorems are left as exercises.Many of them are too difficult for a beginner.The book just state some basic defintion and theorem without examples, and even some proofs of the theorems are not complete.Many algorithms are skipped or illustrated badly.I can give no reason for the beginner to buy this book. I would suggest the reader to see ""A first Look At Graph Theory"" by John O. Clark"
2,Not at this price,"This is a very, very thin introductory work on graph theory.It loses one star because the section numbering and the chapter numbering aren't aligned correctly. (The section numbers increase monotonically from 1 to N. Chapter breaks are inserted almost randomly as a way of grouping sections.)It loses another star because it doesn't serve the needs of beginners very well. As a previous reviewer has pointed out, it doesn't contain many examples, and results are often stated with only sketch proofs.It loses one final star because of its ridiculous price. For the same dollar amount, one could buy a good introductory book (such as Chartrand's ""Introduction to Graph Theory""), a Schaum's outline (for solved problems), and a decent high-level book for mathematical depth.On the positive side, Prentice did print this thing on good paper..."
3,Needs better songwriting and promotion,"When I first heard Terry Dexter taking the place of Tamia on a performance of Eric Benet's ""Spend My Life With You"" on BET's now-defunct ""Planet Groove"", I loved her voice. Then I saw her featured on that song's remix, and I was more in love. After seeing ""Better Than Me"", I rushed out to, uh, borrow the album.I'm glad that I only borrowed this album. First off, Terry is one heck of a singer, as other reviewers have mentioned. But the lyrics, as is usually the case, leave a lot to be desired. If the lyrics are good, I'd know it, but with the exception of ""Anything"" and ""Better Than Me"" (where she says she trying to ""be that friend"", which got me a little curious), this wasn't the case here. Maybe that's why Warner Bros. didn't promote the album that much? Oh well, now Terry Dexter is thrown into the pile of all of the other Tasha Holidays, Simone Hineses and Brigette McWilliamses and may never get another chance of blessing us with that stellar voice."
4,Needs more balance and more sound 2 the rhythm,"I thought nobody wouldn't believe what she's trying to say on her lyrics 2 her songs. I think she's real talent but she kept messing up so badly. I hope she'll come back and do 'nother album 'cuz I'd been awaiting for her to put out 1 in 'bout 5 or 6 years. Wish her all the success and the talent she has in her. But she's need to come up with a more mature album with sum upbeats and stuff. Not to say I hate her, but she has a remarkable voice. I pray that she'll come 4 recovery on new songs she working on. Keep it up, Terry I'm a real big fan 2 your music. 'Specially recommmend albums from Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, Musiq, Jon B., Tamia, Quincy Jones, Grover Washington, Jr., Donnie, India.Arie, Soul II Soul, Donna Garnier, Rhian Benson, Javier, Ricky Fante, Teena Marie, Dwele, Mike Phillips, Jeff Bradshaw, Floetry, Heather Headley, Ruben Studdard, Van Hunt, Lenny Kravitz, Kanye West, Twista, OutKast, Eve, Gwen Stefani, just to name a few."
3,A sparkling debut,"I held off on getting this CD because I hadn't heard any songs from it at all. Then I saw Ms.Dexter on BET Live from LA, when she sang the duet w/Eric Benet for his remix of ""spend my life with you"". I thought that she was a last minute fill in because Tamia was off with Grant Hill somewhere, but when they announced that she had her album out and please pick it up I decided to give her a listen. I feel that this is a really strong debut with straight R&B. Her voice is very soulful and she doesn't sound just like everyone else. I would hope that she gets exposure in some way shape or form because she should be heard. It's a good listen from reel to reel. So do yourself a favor, instead of picking up the hot single from some better known artist's album that radio's been playing for the last 2 months. Pick up Terry Dexter, it'll be worth your while. Maybe next time the braintrust at BET will let her sing her own material.........."
4,Solid UFC vid for New and Seasoned MMA Fans,"The overall interface and fights are quite nice, exciting as well. Yet, some fights aren't in super high res as some other ones; for there were fights which didn't use to be broadcasted in HD back in the day. So the upscaled fights are really the only fights you can pick out the difference HD rez quality.Overall: 8.5/10"

4,I love this band!,Part one of 6 from TDH. Kind of a short cd but it gets you ready for the next installment in the series. Dont listen to these cd's out of order or you wont understand the story or timeline.
2,not as good as earlier efforts,skip this one ... the puns are ok but the plot is labored and the pseudo language of the birds is cloying rather than amusing
4,Good but not the Best in the series,I liked how the book gave more information about some of the more minor characters in the series (Top Myer for instance). However there were some parts that got a littlw carried away. (Schultz and his obsession) Overall a very good addition to the series. Is book six the last one? When is it coming out? I hope that they write more than just six!
4,depeche Mode CD awesome!,"I just bought the CD Construction Time Again by dePeche Mode from Amazon. It was delivered promptly with NO problems. The disc was in mint condition. It encouraged me to continue to use Amazon for my media purchases - when I don't just get the mp3s from iTunes, that is. amazon is an amazing site & company who ALWAYS get what I desire to me without issues. Quite probably my favorite site to order things from online, I think!"
1,DO NOT BUY! DOES NOT WORK@,"This USB extender is a POS. Does not work with iPods, phones, webcames, controllers, or anything that sends information. All this USB extender does is transfer power, NOT data.Complete waste of money, thanks..."
4,USB extension cable,"A good quality USB extension cable @ a good price. I also chose white so you can see it. Thanks, Scot"
1,USB 2.0 Ext cable 15',"Cable delivered on time. Unfortunately the USB 2.0 ext cable was defective. Tried usb mice, webcams, flash drives, on 2 pc systems. Nada, nothing worked. Will go back to local retailers for all my under $15 computer equipment. Not worth my time to return cable etc."
5,Well written introductory text,"A well written book. Unlike many other authors that present a theorem and left readers to be perplexed at some point, Nancy Rodgers provide a thorough guidance toward the subject. Explaining the meaning of each theorem with enough examples, guiding readers how to express their logical thought by manipulating mathematical symbol and operator. Suitable not only for math or science students, but also for anyone (with some math background) interested to learn the subject (thus improving the way they express their thought)."
5,Awesome Heater,"This heater is what I would consider the best ""bang for the buck"". I have used the Buddy Heater to both heat my camper and my fish house and it works just as well as the box says it will. I bought the plug in for the fan because I don't like always buying batteries and the fan works great. I rarely use the high setting because it is just too hot. I live in Alaska and have used it even when it is -25 out and it still heats my Eskimo portable fish house. Anyway if you buy this product you will be satisfied."
2,Terrible smell caused headache. Defective?,Purchased the big buddy from Northern Tool as I owned Mr. Heater buddies in the past. Installed a 1lb cylinder and fired it up. Noticed immediately that smell that comes from some propane heaters but realized soon this one was worse than average. 20 minute run time heated up my RV nicely but the smell and eye irritation drove me out of there. Tried using it again next day with same result and yes I did have adequate ventilation. Returned the unit today and will go with the Olympian 6 I guess?
1,My new Big Buddy freezes up consistently,"There are known problems with this heater freezing up. The valve, that is shared between the two inlets, will freeze and the heater will shut off during operation.I've tried this several times, and several ways, one tank or two. This is not as reliable as the Mr Heater single burner.I've used Mr. Heater products for years, this is the first lemon I've bought from this american company. Come on guys, test your stuff more thoroughly. We buy these heaters as emergency backups... it's cold in Virginia in the winter, and I need my stuff to work!I'm going to sell mine (or just dump it, I can't see giving this to someone who would find that it doesent work when they need it)."
2,Had a problem,"Got the heater in quick time. It is a very well built heater. After using for 4 to 5 hours the fan started making a noticable loud clicking as if it was hitting something. This only happened when the unit was warm. So, I wanted to return and replace the unit but was told by Kotula's 'they did not have any of this type anymore and all they would do is to refund my money""."
2,OK but with reservations,"The heater will heat a place up in no time but, if you start it every time in an unheated room it will consume large amounts of propane. Too much in my experience."
3,Good for what it is.,"I was a little disappointed in this heater's power. I bought it for emergency heating bedrooms inside the house in the case that we lost power. I think it'll work fine for that. I was hopeful that I could use it occasionally to heat my garage. I left it running on full blast for two hours in the garage; the temperature went from 46 to 50. Granted, this was the garage, with little to no insulation on the giant metal door. It was 40 outside. I was also disappointed in the built in fan. It's pretty much worthless. The heat definitely rises to the ceiling with or without the fan on.Overall, I think I will be happy with this heater. The main reason I bought it was for emergency heating, which I think it will do fine. I am happy to know that if we were to lose power overnight in the winter, this heater will keep our bedroom plenty warm."
3,Its OK,"I bought this for back up heat at our remote cabin when I was to lazy to get up and stoke the wood stove at night. Does a good job of warming up 400 sq feet when on high and with the fan running, but uses propane fast. It is easier on the gas on medium, but you have to put it right next to the bed to stay cozy. The temperatures ranged from 5-30 degrees outside, but the cabin is insulated. I am looking for a larger unit for the main room and will use this for the loft when we have guests."
5,Outdoorsman / Professonal,The best and most effecient heater that I've ever used. The added little feature of having a blower fan really adds a nice overall touch to the heater. I borrowed the smaller version from a friend and decided to go with the larger unit. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone!!
4,Big Buddy work well!,"Very satisfied! The item lived up to it promises. I have a 900 sq ft. garage and it takes the chill out very fast. I would buy a ""BIGGER BUDDY"" if I could."
1,"Do NOT buy this heater, it is riddled with problems","I bought this heater a couple of weeks ago only to find out that they are about to do a recall and Mr. Heater advises that you don't use it. Mr. Heater customer service is horrible and they won't try to help you fix the problem, they're waiting until someone forces them to fix the problem. Mine only stays running for about 10 minutes and then goes out when using portable cylinders, as do 2 of my friends. Don't wait for Mr. Heater to help you as it will be too late, my suggestion is to return this cheap, shoddy piece of junk"
4,WOW - A must for any cold season camper,"This ""Buddy"" will keep your tent nice and toasty when camping on cold nights, I used this camping in the high desert with snow on the ground. It didn't run all night on high without running out of gas, so I recommend hooking it up to a bigger tank than the little disposable ones it runs off of."
2,This one stinks,"This is the third of these heaters I have purchased. The first two work fine but this one gives off terrible fumes. I wish I had started using it earlier but it has been in the box since I purchased it until now, when I put it in my newly completed shop. Now that I have had it for awhile I doubt that I can return it. My advice is that once you get it, try it immediately, don't wait."
5,Great Heater,"I have owned the Big Buddy Heater for a couple years now and must say it is one of the best cold weather items I have found. The heater can be operated with (2) 1lb. cylinders or a 20 # refillable cylinder,hose and the recommended fuel filter. ( Recently, I found out there is another even better hose to use with a refillable cylinder) The hose F271803 and you don't even need a fuel filter!! The heater has a small fan that circulates the warm air and runs on D batteries or 115 volt adapter.I talk to a lot of RV owners and they swear by the heater."
1,Big Buddy disappointment.,"After having bought and used the Little Buddy heater, I purchased the Big Buddy to get the higher heat output for my shed and back porch. The unit is well made and very sound. There are two major problems that I have found: 1)when the heater is on the highest setting, the propane cylinders get so cold from the high flow of gas that the heater shuts down. This is only a problem if the temperature that you are using it in is below 40 degrees F. If you are using it as an auxillary heater in the house, it does not frost up. 2) hooking the heater to a larger tank is not even discussed in the instruction manual, other than stating that an inline fuel filter should be used. It doesn't state if the line should be hooked to one side of the heater or the other, or if you need 2 hoses.The frosting up issue is the biggest disappointment for me. I can't use it in my shed in the winter because of this. Make sure you know how you are going to use this unit before you purchase it."
1,Non-Functional Out of the Box,"First, this is an opinion based upon personal experience with the Bid Buddy heater and should not reflect adversely upon any seller of the product. Received this heater as a Christmas gift. Out of the box, it did not fully function. The righ-side would not transfer propane to the burner--only the left-side worked. The switch for the fan was permanently ""on"". Did not matter if you switched it to the ""off"" position--the fan continued to operate. If they could not get a simple on/off switch correct, how do I trust the built-n safety switches for tip-over and carbon mono sensing While it appears to be well made, it is not. Again, tired of poor quality management vis-a-vis made in China products."
2,Piece of junk,"This is the worst piece of junk I ever used in my 64 years. If you do get the pilot to stay on, it will go out when you switch to the burner. Most of the time, you can't keep the pilot lit long enough to get the burner lit. I am so sorry I didn't heed the reviews I read about this procuct before I purchased one. I thought it was other users inability. READ THE WARNINGS, don't buy this piece of JUNK."
2,Gas Guzzler,This is not at all enery efficient. One 20lb propane worked for only 2 days indoor. So this is expensive than electric heaters comparing the energy price.
1,batteries,was excited when i bought it. but it didnt work only with batteries and didnt try with outlet becus wanted only for when no power in house and manual also doesnt show proparly so still looking.
4,Works well,"I bought this to heat my shed from a large, external propane tanks. Based on past reviews, I also purchased the Mr. Heater 12 foot hose and AC adapter. It's a little finicky to start when you need to bleed the air out of the hose, but once going, heats my 10x14 shed very quickly. Does shut down if tapped, but I really can't complain about a safety feature like that. It starts right up again after that."
1,Doen't last,"I have purchased 2 of these units and in both cases the pilot light WILL NOT stay lit.They did not last more than 3 months of use. Will not waste any more money on this product.Mr Heater MH18B Portable ""Big Buddy"" Heater"
2,Well it throws some heat,"I bought this with the quick connect hose to use with a 20Gallon tank, and used batteries for the fan. I also bought the filter adapter which cannot be used with the quick connect hose, then i missed the return window (my fault). Anyways for the money I think if I had tried it sooner I probably would have returned it. The fans have an annoying high pitched hummmmm, and the heat output is just ok, not great. My garage is insulated, not heated, and running this for about 30 minutes on high just barely took the foggy breadth out of the air, much like my electric already was able to do."
5,Great value for money,"This is a great heater for the price. You may want to get the hose to hook up a 5 gallon tank to save money. It cost $11.75 to fill a 5 gallon (20 lb) tank (12/2010). Two one pound bottles (2 lb) cost $11.60, at this rate 20 lbs would cost $58. So it pays to get the $45 quick connect hose. It works well and has good safety features."
4,Not good for 350sq. ft of uninstulated space,"I bought this heater holding out much hope that it would heat up my 350sq. ft. uninsulated attached garage but unfortunately it just can't do the duty so I've relegated it to small space heater use. The specifications say 400sq ft. capability BUT that will need to be an insulated enclosure and even then that will be pushing its limits. None-the-less, following the directions it is extremely easy to use and light. I live above 5000 feet and have absolutely no problems with it. I use the long hose with a 20# propane tank. For tents, RV's, small insulated rooms and ice shacks this should work very well."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER CONSTANTLY SHUTS OFF,THIS HEATER CONSTANTLY SHUTS OFF. I have have to relight every few minutes witch is a fire hazard because there is still propane with no pilot light. also the fan runs poor and slow. AND the manual is very vague on the use of the fan with battery and/or 6v cord.
5,Mr Heater Big Buddy,"Heater performs great, I would suggest the hose adapter or refill adapter for the small bottles if you use it much. Good product."
2,SAFETY QUESTIONS NEED RESOLUTION.,"UPDATED REVIEW:HEADLINE: CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISION ISSUES STOP USE ORDER FOR THIS ITEM. THE MANUFACTURER IS COOPERATING WITH THE CPSC BUT ALL USE OF THIS HEATER SHOULD STOP. CONTACT MR HEATER CUSTOMER SERVICE @ 800 251 0001. IF YOU KNOW ANY ONE WHO IS USING ONE OF THESE HEATERS ADVISE THEM TO STOP NOW. ENERCO EXPECTS A COMPLETE ADVISORY BY FEBRUARY 1, 2005."
3,USEFUL HEATER WITH SOME PROBLEMS,"The big buddy is basically useless with the small cylinders, since at full heat they quickly freeze-up and shut the unit off. With 20-lb cylinders it works good, but be aware that if used indoors, if the hose leaks, bye-bye house. I have used mine for two years in Connecticut winters with pretty good luck, however both regulators have now shut down and I will throw the unit away. The question is, at two years use at $150.00 is the heater worth it? Probably yes. The fuel filter is probably a necessity, since I think dirt probably killed the regulators."
5,Mr Heater Big Buddy,"The Big Buddy workes great, used on christmas eve on my paito and keep it just rightwished i had brought the 20lb hose hookup, just what i needed, very quiet"
4,Great for the garage,"I bought this heater to run in the garage during the winter when I wash my car. The heater has no problem heating the garage into the sixties when on full heat. Once the garage is warm, I can maintain the heat at the half setting. I have a standard double car garage to heat. As others have mentioned, the fan doesn't really work that well, but I'm not standing next to it anyway. The purpose of the unit is to heat the room and it does that fine. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the installation of the batteries was difficult. The unit takes two rows of batteries and the springs for the 1st row of batteries gets in the way of installing the second row. They should of staggered the batteries or put them side-by-side. Other than that, this unit works great."
5,Very Pleased,"I bought two of these heaters, two hoses with quick connects on one end and a regulator with screw on connector on the other (#F271803), and two of the 110v to 6 volt power adapters (F276127). I hooked both heaters up with their hoses to 20# propane tanks in my shop and let them each burn on high for an hour. They worked flawlessly. As another poster said, you have to hold down the pilot button for at least 90 seconds to get the propane up through the hose and into the heater. These units were allowed to cool down and were reboxed without the styrofoam or plastic bags to wait for a winter emergency.I will update this review if I ever have any problem with these heaters."
5,I love it,"The best in the best thing. Excellent, fabulous, fantastic. In the place to the one that I go of camping site in the nights the cold descends to 1 or 2 grades, before i have that that to sleep with gloves, pasamontañas and two layers of clothes. Now to the interior of my tent I can sleep in underwear. It is certain.. this heater is formidable. If he/she falls it turns off alone, if there is not I oxygenate he/she fades alone. I recommend to control the emission of monoxide of carbon with a detector."
2,No Buddy of Mine,"I bought two Big Buddy Heaters from Amazon and neither one will run off a 20lb. propane tank with the hoses provided. The hose valve seat is to deep for the regulator to open, thus no gas flow. Mr. Heater seems to be giving me the run around. The heater works great with the 1lb. disposable propane bottles. If I can get a hose from Mr. Heater that will work I would love this little heater, but until that happens I am not to happy with it."
1,The Table of Contents doesn't work,The Table of Contentsis one of the main pointsof this collectionone would thinkShame Amazon!You ought to repair itand inform buyers to load it up again
5,I found the book incredible. Most informative,"I have often wondered about the completeness of the stories told in the bible. After performing considerable research and concluding that stories as set forth in the bible were not in fact complete, I stumbled across this book. I was captivated by the use of names and situations so easily correlated to those situations without names found in the bible. So many questions going unanswered for many years now suddenly came to closure as a result of reading this book. It forced me to find the seven volume set of ""Legends of the Jews"" which was accomplished without the knowledge of ""amazon.com""...but I certainly thank God for your existence today. This book is a 10 and I use it in my religion studies at my college prep high school. The students rate it as illuminating."
5,nelzas@pathcom.com,"A great book that combines the stories of the old testament with jewish Aggada. Answers all your questions that are covered in the Aggada but considered too detailed for bible inclusion. For example if Adam and eve had two sons, Cain and Abel, whom did they marry?"
3,movie,Great movie. good action in it and can be used to open the lines of communication on illicit drugs with your kids.
4,Goldie is Spectacular,"This is an honest and loving movie that deals with life right up front. It's a true testament for trying your best, perhaps failing a little but not backing down when things go wrong. The challenges to this role that Goldie created were breathtakingly brilliant. I recommend this movie especially to single mom's who go through life trying to do their best for their kids. I think Goldie will become one of your heroes. You do what you have to do to raise your kids. You may lose sight once in a while, but you can't be where the kids are all the time and you have to trust them and hope they do well. They may take the wrong road, but it is the love of a mother that brings them back to living life correctly. Bravo, Goldie. This movie gave me a new respect for single mom's and their challenges."
2,Crocked Chriscross,"So-so movie with so-so acting - think of an unsuccessful cross between one of those many made-for-television grade-B drama films on the Lifetime Channel and an ABC Afterschool Special and you have a general idea what the film is like.See on cable if you must, don't waste your time renting it out or buying it."
3,"A movie to relax by, with beautiful locations","Goldie Hawn plays a single mother who resorts to stripping to support her son, played by David Arnott. In fact, the movie centers on David and his coming-of-age. Nothing really new here, but the film has a good heart (which it wears on its sleeve often enough).Certainly this is not a great movie, but the Key West locations are beautiful. It's summer all the time there, and you can practically feel that muggy heat coming through the screen. The film has a languid (okay, slow) pace, befitting its 'life is a beach' flavor. Goldie looks great and the performances are fine. It's just unfortunate that the trivial story fails to develop the dramatic tension required of a better film. So basically this will appeal to fans of Goldie Hawn, movies set on the Florida coast, and lovers of old Mopars (Goldie drives a really cool '59 DeSoto). Made me wish I grew up there. :>"
3,Blonde...,"A 'coming of age' movie of sorts, this particular feature is a tad slow for my general taste. However, David Arnott is so incredibly gorgeuos, I find myself watching this one again and again. A good and believable young actor he is as well. I've always enjoyed Goldie Hawn, which makes this one well worth owning in my book."
4,Good coming of age movie,"This is a good coming of age movie. David Arnott did a great job portraying a kid trapped in a difficult living situation with a mom who's stripping for money and a dad who's divorced from his mom and living in a monestary after suffering post traumatic stress from the war in Nam. The movie did run slow and the ending was kind of abrupt. Overall, I'm glad I purchased the movie and I'll watch it again."
5,jack,"one of Goldie Hawn's less known movies, but anything by her has to be good. Story line follows lives of a couple of dancers I know"
3,Instruction not as good as other Step by Step books,"This is one of those books that encourage unique critiques by all that actually used it. ""It should have been reduced to 3 thinner books in a series,"" said one manager whose staff replaced a broken desk leg with it. ""By mid-book the lessons are way too long,"" opined a Chief Technology Officer. One unusually intelligent intern created ten steps for improving this book. Finally, a charitable sales manager threw it out rather than donate it."
4,Microsoft Access Step by Step,"The book is top notch in its layout and presentation. True to its name, it basically gives you an in-depth tour of Access with sample databases on cd-rom. The paper its printed on is great quality, the illustrations are excellent as well. I never felt lost in the material.This ""tour"" is clear and comprehensive. This book is totally geared towards an introduction to Microsoft Access. It doesn't teach you general database theory or construction. I bought this book because I had a work project that involved Access, and I had never built a database before. It serves its purpose in this regard, but I can't say I come away with a full knowledge of the best ways to design a database."
5,MS Access Version 2002 Step by Step,An excellent book. The CD lessons are very helpful and the book is well written. It covers so much more than I ever found in a single chapter in an all in one MS Office instruction book.
4,"MAN,THIS SATISFIES!","Sometimes only a spaghetti western can satisfy my cravings for some trash cinema,and I feel that this one does in spades! More-or-less a riff on the Dirty Dozen, set in the Civil War era.I won't bore you with a lengthy plot synopsis - the film slows down a bit in certain stretches (like most Spaghetti's),but the final act is something to see! Crazy rip-off of Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch"" minus the slow-mo bits,machine guns and bodies everywhere! Ha,Ha!!"
2,Maybe itwas better in Italian,"I love spaghettis for the landscapes, the campy performances, and the propaganda. This movie only really delivers on the first, despite the presence of Telly Savalas as a Confederate officer not even trying to have a Southern accent. The token minority is a Native American who is pretty bad but doesn't get to say much. Horribly dubbed. Can't really recommend it."
2,Not so engaging...,"Despite the Fistful of Dynamite looking cover art, Leone this is not. It's nothing more than a mediocre spaghetti at best and is really weakened by the dubbing of American actors who were already speaking english. I mean really, who dubs over the legendary voice of the Late, Great Mr. James Coburn!?!?!note: The fort in this flick is the same fort built for El Condor with Lee Van Cleef and Jim Brown - which is a much, much better film."
3,It's a Chocker!,"It fits like a chocker!If anyone is thinking about purchasing this necklace, get an extention to go on it to fit less snug.But overall, this is a cute necklace."
2,Snippets of Government Charts no overview,"The charts flowed from page to page without any organization or design. There was no overall master chart showing the page number for the individual charts.Save your money, these aren't as good as the free charts the marinas give out.Kind of a disappointment. Produced on good water proof paper with good binding, these could have been a real asset if a little more thought had been given."
3,very little music,"This album contains very little actual music. The best stuff are the snippets of Fats Waller playing pipe organ. If you want that stuff, go to the source: get ""Young Fats at the Organ."" It has the complete recordings of all the snippets heard on this CD and you can appreciate them in their true context. They're not creepy, but very beautiful and somber recordings, very much worth listening to. I like this film a lot, and have seen it many times, but I have to admit that this CD is pretty lacking in comparison. Movie =A ; CD =C+"
1,Doesn't seem to work with the iPod Classic,"I found an iGo Car Charger and A61 tip for half price at a store near where I live. I tested it out and it seemed to work alright. I recently got the wall charger for Christmas and tried to charge my iPod Classic (6th generation, 80GB) here in my dorm room now and it recognizes that something has been plugged in, but the charging symbol won't show up and it won't charge (leaving the tip plugged in even without the symbol).I've been using the iGo wall charger mentioned previously for the last month charging my phone (A92 tip for LG) and it works perfectly, so that isn't the problem.Go with the A133 if you have any of the newer iPod models, it's what the iGo website suggests when you navigate through their website."
5,"Great tips, great price. *CHARGES IPAD*","I bought a few of these tips because they charge Apple iPads and they probably won't be available much longer. I believe iGo stopped manufacturing them since they were originally marketed as charging the older Apple devices. I know, the iGo website says that there is no tip that'll charge an iPad... But that's bogus. This one works just fine. Buy one now before you can't find them anymore!"
5,Best thing since white rice,"This tip charges the ipad, ipad 2, and ipod touch 4g with the two cameras.Here's the specs for the ipad 2 charger: (Input 100-240V, 0.45Amps), 50-60Hz, (Output 5.1 Volts, 2.1 Amps, 10 Watts)Here's the specs for the iGo charger: (Input 100-240V, 0.3 Amps), 50-60 Hz, (Output 3.1-9 Volts, 1.5 Amps, 8Watts).The only difference I see is that the Amps and Watts are different, so in a pinch you can use the iGo charger, but it will charge just a bit slower than the Apple factory charger."
5,Works with iPhone 3gs,This item works great with my iPhone 3gs! MUCH cheaper than the other model and does the same thing! there is no voltage drop or increase!
5,Turn It Loose,"If you can sit still through this rhythm pounding sound, you are from a planet where there is no music. Take a slice of Neville Brothers, some Tower of Power, throw in a dash of early Little Feat, stir heartily with New Orleans R & B, funkify the whole thing, and, man, you got a get-down sound that'll make you feel better than JB. When I listen, I can't stop grinnin'."
4,"Mariettas, ""12""","""This Los Angeles based band has shared the bill with the likes of Eve 6 and Din Pedals. Their/pop/rock style has sort of a T-Hip flavor to it, incorporating amusing lyrics. Track #11 (Katie Wore the Patches Low) has a catchy melody that will stick in your head. Each of The Mariettas has an extensive musical background and it's reflected in their work"" - Carol Tamburo"
5,Great case...only negative is the velcro strips,"This is very nice case, especially for the price. It is rugged, yet not overly large, and it provides excellent protection for your Mako/Revo in case you drop it. The pockets and ID card window are nicely laid out inside, and I am thinking about using the case as my wallet.The only complaint I have is the velcro strips that are attached to the Mako. The strips are rather thick and make docking difficult since the connector on the Mako does not always make solid contact with the docking station. However, I have been able to get it working properly now with little effort. I just to push the Mako down in the docking station until the green ""docked"" light turns on, and it works well."
1,Mako,"If the case did not fit the organizer, I would think ... sent me the wrong product. It seems to consist of two pieces of vinyl-covered cardboard held together with a strip of Grade Z elastic. I would judge it contains about 75 cents worth of material. It does not appear that the organizer is protected around the edges, only on the front and back. This is a ... product, not a ... one."
1,ICK!,"This is suppose to be a Wal Mart Exclusive. It's a boring doll, what's so special about it? There too many Zodiac dolls to keep up with. I mean, It's just a doll with a dress with some sign on it. All the Zodiac dolls are basically clones(except for the colour of the skin, hair, and dress) That's it! It's just boring. I don't think it's even a Barbie collector at all. It think it's just a barbie that you take out of the box and play with. BORING!"
5,A really good CD,"This is a really good CD! It's one that you will not regret. It has a solid collection of songs. Just give it a chance, and you won't regret."
3,Good CD...yeah,"I first heard this album years ago when I lived in a small town south of where I am now. They decided to play the whole album and from that I decided to buy it. However, it wasn't available anywhere and I didn't have internet. So, I let it go. Then, one day, a while back, I kept thinking about this one song ""Don't Try to Find Me."" It wouldn't leave my head for anything.Then, one day I had the internet and I googled it! I instantly found it and within moments I it ordered. When it arrived I listened to it from beginning to end. For what it is, it's amazing. The budget, I think, was kind of low for the recording or maybe mass production. Either way, the quality of some of the audio is less than expected but still good. It kinda sounds like it was done with an 8track or something.If you like good, traditional, country music, check it out. You won't be sorry."
5,Visionary and beautiful,I loved this book. It was brilliantly written and highly suspensful. Gavin is a masterful writer.
3,Much Smaller than Expected,"I thought this would be larger (because I had a similar one given to me) but it is only about 1/2"" -- if that. Other than that, it's very nice."
4,Be prepared to replace tines,"As stated in other reviews, this is a solid product that works well. What I didn't expect though, was that on the first use, one tine came off and one snapped off. They are made of good, solid steel so I'm hoping this was a freak thing and plan to find replacement parts and keep it."
5,Aerator,Recieved the product quickly. As with other reviews the box it came in was full of hole's from the spikes. This can't be avoided unless they send it in a wooden carton. I don't think you'll see that happen. As far as the product goes it works great! Easy to assemble. I would highly recommend.
2,Aerator,Broke 8 tines on the first use. Ground was not overly hard and I used 40 pounds of weight. Wish I had used it sooner so I could have returned it. Now have to find replacement tines
5,Great value for the price!,Received the aerator a few days ago. It arrived almost totally assembled. Only had to install the draw bar and the activator handle. Incredibly sturdy unit. Just used on two yards that total about one acre. Turning is no problem since the spades spin independently. Awesome powder coated finish makes for easy cleanup. You could spend twice as much for an aerator from other manufacturers for this level of quality. Great value!
5,Precision Products Plug Aerator,This aerator works well but the sod must not be dry and hard or the aerator bounces (even with weight). The grass should be relatively soft (early spring or after a thorough watering).The plugs poked through the cardboard packaging but there was no damage. Assembled very easily in a matter of just a few minutes and was ready to use.I recommend this product and would buy it again.
4,Another great story from Deutermann,"This was my first ""Cam Richter"" novel, which I finished about ten days ago, and then started the next one right away (sorry, the title escapes me). Loved the story. I've read many of Deutermann's books, and he always spins an involved mystery. Keeps you thinking through the whole book. This one uses the police detective hero instead of a military hero (previous books I've read). I liked that and that the story involves the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, western North Carolina, and mountain lions. Looking forward to ""Moonpool"", ""Nightwatchers"" and more Cam Richter!"
2,Inconsistent,"Note: I do all my ""reading"" of late as audio books.Pros: Some good edge of the seat tension at times. The good guy doesn't win it all.Cons: Character acts inconsistently, creating a lot of his own problems. A real human wouldn't be so brilliant one second and dense the next. Unsatisfactory motivations for characters to give up information, it just didn't click sometimes. Unsatisfactory ending.More: A lot of the edge of the seat circumstances are created when the lead character acts dumb as a rock. He (Richter) makes a great conclusion one second and then does the dumbest move the next. It's like a teen chainsaw movie where the girl bashes the hockey mask guy in the head, and then runs back in the house where she can be trapped. You just want to scream ""look right in front of you, you moron""."
2,Dances Too Much,"I have read all of PT'S books. I guess I am not patient enough for this one. In my opinion, this book has twisted and turned me over and over again until I finally gave up. If I am not grabbed by the first half, I won't be able to finish. That's me, not the average reader, I am sure."
2,No ending,You waste hours reading only to get to what is the most frustrating ending. None of the issues were tied together or really resolved. My first Deuterman and probably my last.
3,Do yourself a favor...,"Do yourself a favor and get the paperback version. The Kindle version is full of conversion errors. (""the"" = ""die""???) Don't they proofread them?That aside, I have mixed feelings about this book. The story is good, although a bit far-fetched in places. If I ignored the mental questions that kept bubbling up, then there were some gripping moments. However, there were also parts that felt contrived. Some of the dialogue, in particular, didn't come across well.This is the first in a series, and after this, Cam becomes a private eye. That may help the series, particularly if Cam spends more time in the mountains than in the city, and takes his German shepherds, Frick and Frack, along.."
4,"Adventure, politics, love....it's all here but w/ a somewhat different twist","This novel takes a different approach to the mystery/thriller concept. It's nice to see a book that's not so formulaic. Adventure, politics, love....it's all here but w/ a somewhat different twist. I definitely want to read more books by this author."
1,I wish there were some sort of directions... Shipping was the cost of the trunk...,"My suggestion is this: Go on Craigslist and find someone parting out their car. I installed this myself without prior experience, but it was not easy. the holes where the license plate should go are too wide, so I cannot get my plate on both, just one. I would not buy from this company again. Shipping took a long time and they never communicated with me about when I would receive the trunk, even though I emailed several times."
2,"Hackneyed, Pompous and Pretentious","The chapters on Kansai are original and by far the most enjoyable elements in this book - but, overall, give me Alan Booth any day for a fresh and insightful view of Japan. Kerr's book is a very personal (and not unsympathetic)account written, it might seem, to counter criticism he received as a student of Japanese. The book is littered with name-dropping to no apparent end and the very title (in Japanese) which draws parallels with Proust, is ludicrous. The fact that it won a Japanese literary prize is enormously revealing about the Japanese public in itself (and not very flattering). Kerr is undoubtedly very knowledgeable but I'd rather not have this rammed down my throat!"
1,Please put it back on the shelf!,"I read this book on a plane to Japan for a two week vacation in November. I thought it was depressing and achingly nostalgic. As I was extremely excited to explore Japan, Alex Kerr focuses on how Japan used to be great in so many areas, but how it lacks in everything now. From nature, to people, the arts, and society in general, he contends that the country is suffocating. One may enjoy this book if that is what you are expecting. I, however, did not view Japan in the light that Alex Kerr portrays it."
4,Comforting to find a like mind....,As a on/off resident of Japan I am interested that Alex Kerr finds Japan so fascinating yet is also able to see its flaws and its lack of humanity. NB Kabuki and the lack of themes of friendship. I am particularly fascinated why he debunked to Bangkok.
4,A must read for those interested in Japan,"Three years ago, Alex Kerr finally left the Japan he had called home for some 30 years prior to that. For a look at why, there is no better place to start than his seminal work on the willful and casual destruction of Japanese culture.Originally written in Japanese, Kerr's work documents the loss of what drew him to Japan in the first place: its spectacular traditional arts. Divided into chapters on Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, legendary American businessman Trammell Crow, Kabuki, Kerr's own art collecting and calligraphy. Lost Japan is a must-read for anyone interested in modern and pre-modern Japan."
5,A must-read for those interested in contemporary Japan,"While I have nothing comparable to the history of exposure to Japan that Mr. Kerr does, his book really struck a chord with me in terms of my experience of the country. Japan is a fascinating place for us westerners - so different. Yet you can't help but get the sense that it has changed for the worse in many ways - the cities are not beautiful by any means, in fact they are generally quite ugly, etc. But there is an underlying current of beauty there that comes through somehow - in the people I think. Anyway, this book reflected my own feelings about Japan, and I'm sure that's the major reason I enjoyed it so much."
2,Least Favorite Wiggles CD,"As the parents of a 1 1/2 year old who dearly loves The Wiggles'""Yummy Yummy"" CD, we ordered ""Let's Wiggle"" and ""Hoop-Dee-Doo!"" to give her a larger variety of songs to listen to. Although ""Let's Wiggle"" was very similar in its wonderful, ingenious Wiggles style to ""Yummy Yummy"", ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"" was quite a disappointment. Our daughter only listens to the first song, and she has had it with this CD. It seems to incorporate more of the instrumental and typical garden variety songs found on some other children's CD's. A lot of the songs are not quite as ""bouncy"" as the usual Wiggles' style. Of the Wiggles CDs, I would recommend ""Yummy Yummy"" and ""Let's Wiggle"", but would suggest skipping this one and saving your money. I wish we had."
3,Ok,Not really to happy with this CD only three maybe four songs on the CD that my kids knew the rest of the songs the wiggles don't sing on there show or in there movies didn't care to much for this CD.
1,Disappointing,"This book in no way portrayed an accurate description of the real life of Jonbenet Ramsey or what her life would have truly been like had she survived. It appears more an attempt to attach a famous name to an unknown writer. If the purpose was to bring to light the true horrors of child sexual abuse and its exploitation in the media, the point would have been better served by using an example that is not cut from whole cloth and derived directly from the media which it condemns. The Ramsey case will eventually be widely known as the case that was extensively tried inacurately in the media as much as for the murder itself. I found the book disappointing and don't believe the cause of child sexual abuse was furthered in any way."
1,"Horrible, Disgusting and a Waste of Money",This book is a waste of time! It is disgusting and made me sick. I can't believe I wasted my money on this!
1,why cant they let her rest in peace??,"while this book isnt exactly based on jonbenets murder it does examine the ""why did it happen"" issue.while every other reviewer (so far)thinks this is fantastic book,i dont understand why a book about sexual abuse is named after an innocent 6 year old child who can no longer defend herself.the title ""an evening with jonbenet ramsey""makes me sick,she was an innocent 6 year old child,this type of book shouldnt be named after an innocent 6 year old who couldnt defend herself.respect jonbenet and her memory and dont buy this book,isnt it about time little jonbenet was left to rest in peace??...........i think so"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up for my children. At first reading, I was concerned that it was a ghost story, which might be a little too scary for my three year old. I was delightfully surprised that it is more of a mystery, with a little girl (the narrator) discovering Emily Dickinson in the house across the street. Barbara Cooney's slightly primitive paintings are a wonderful accompaniament to Michael Bedard's text. But it is Emily's own poetry which is the climax of the book. This book would be an excellent accompaniament to any young person's study of Emily Dickinson's poetry."
3,An ok mystery book to read,"The book ""Emily"" was an ok book for me because I'm just not into mystery books but you other kids may like it. Its about a myth that a person is living in a yellow house and has never came out for 20 years. This little girl, Emily, has always wanted to go there and give the person some bulbs that grow into lillies in the spring. Will she do it? Who knows? You need to read the book to find out what happens next."
3,cool kids movie,I loved this movie as a kid and would like to share it with my kids. Do anyone know where else I can find old movies?
1,Wasn't able to watch video,"I rented this movie & was not able to watch the movie because it never downloaded. I emailed customer service & they responded quickly & said the problem was fixed. But I still had the same problem, movie wouldn't download & was never able to watch it."
3,"Too Much Reality, Sad, Sad , Sad.","Want to cry, see this movie. Want to get depressed, see this movie. Two great actors, sexy Andy Garcia as the overly nurturing husband & Meg Ryan as the alcoholic wife. Maybe because I am such a fan of Meg's I don't want to see her this way. She's capable of good serious acting, she's proven it in this one, but it isn't a great movie. Andy gets to blow-up a couple of times, and he's very good at it. But good acting doesn't necessarily make for a good movie. Dull headache after seeing this one."
3,This is ok,This is just an OK movie I dont see whats so great about it. Meg Ryan's character is a drunk Andy Garcia is her husband and wants her to get clean blah blah blah. At least Meg isnt all perky in this one. In most of her films I want to bash her face in. 3 stars.
2,"Sorry, thumbs down from me","Sorry to go against the grain here, but I really didn't care for this movie. My main problem is with Meg Ryan's character. She just isn't a very likeable person. She drinks, slaps her kids, drives drunk with her kids in the car, completely forgets about her kids while she's out on drinking binges...and we're supposed to feel empathy with this character?And then, when the couple breaks up, guess who gets custody of the kids? Mom the alcoholic! How's that for a little bit of reverse sexism for you? Sorry, but this movie did very little for me."
4,good movie,"I will admit that I don't know any alcoholics and I have not experienced the effects. However, I thought that Meg Ryan was very believable. She seemed as if she was really drunk especially during the scene when her little daughter watched her pop pills and drink at the same time."
2,When a Man Loves a Woman,"I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but was disappointed to find this a dark and depressing drama. It is a story about how being an alcoholic can affect a family and the journey they have to take to stay together. Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a married couple, and Meg is the one with the alcohol addiction. The saying about hitting rock bottom would definitely apply to this film. The audience sees Meg slowly spiral completely out of control, and how low she has to go until she finally is ready to reach out for help. Her family has to come to terms with the fact that she will not be the same person she was as a drunk. When Meg emerges from rehab, everyone is on edge with her - not only her family, but friends and acquaintances too. Everyone has adjustments to make."
5,Its All About Love xoxo,"The movie sucks you in and doesnt let go til the end!! It engrosses you in REAL LIFE, it tells a story that you can feel so close to home it brings tears to your eyes more than once. The first time I saw this movie was at a group meeting for alcoholics and the response was breathtaking it touches your soul and makes you feel the love and the pain and every other emotion possible. The title I must admit doesnt draw you to the movie because you figure *Oh just another romance with no point or purpose* but in reality there are both. This movie is one of my all time favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. Its not just a chick flick for all you guys out there:p Never Judge a book by its cover:)"
5,All Time Favorite Movie,"Get out the kleenex!Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan gave wonderful performances as Alice and Michael Green. I thought this movie showed a very realistic look at alcoholism and the effects on a family. Andy, as Michael, the ever caring, loving, devoted husband looking after his girls, and not seeing a problem exists. Meg, as Alice, insecure and able to hide her drinking from everyone but her children, Jess and Casey. When Alice is forced to face her demons, everyone has to come to grips with their own insecurities and the truth.""When a Man Loves a Woman"", it's amazing what the outcome can be!"
5,justin teplitz collection: Tear Jerker,"meg ryan and andy garcia deserve oscar's for their terrific performance on the silver screen. basically, andy is married to meg with kids. the plot evolves around andy's belittling of his wife because she is an alcoholic. was andy emotionally abusive? i didn't think so, at least not intentionally, but it's debatable i guess. in the end, they learn that loves conquers all and all is forgiven, thus making it a great love story."
2,Well-produced 12-Step Propaganda,"Let's see...Meg Ryan's character is a boozer who physically abuses one of her daughters, drives drunk with both daughters in the car & forgets one at a shopping center. She goes to rehab, quits drinking, but is now chain-smoking. She's rarely home as she goes to AA meetings constantly. Her husband, who is trying to help her the best he can, is the villain-what?The two then separate. Andy Garcia's character starts going to Al-anon, works HIS program, & the two reunite-one happy AA family. Jeez, this movie could have driven Billy Sunday to drink."
3,Good Movie. Bad DVD.,"I looked through a bunch of the reviews posted here and none of the ones I saw mentioned the actual DVD itself. I agree, the movie is outstanding. I would give the movie a 5 rating. But the DVD is not worth even the low price tag! I give the DVD about a 2 rating. The video quality is horrible with lots of artifacting throughout. Come on Hollywood, we all know you can do better than this! I see the quality of this type of release the equivelent of releasing a movie on VHS is EP or SLP mode! Why sacrifice the quality if you don't have to? Maybe it's so a second, and perhaps third version of the film can be released on DVD in a ""remastered"" version over and over and over... Don't buy this disc. Just wait for a quality release to come out...complete with 5.1 audio. Consumers need to start demanding better or the studios will continue to trick us into buying the same movie over and over and over."
2,HOLLYWOOD STYLE DRUNKS,"This will be short because with the many addiction/alcoholic films out there this is by far the most unrealistic. That is it's only and fatal problem.Meg Ryan is a truly beautiful woman. Far,far too beautiful to make a good alcoholic.As her husband,Andy Garcia comes across as a whiny little killjoy.Alcohol ravages the body and ruins skin tone. We are suppose to believe that Ms. ryan is so addicted to alcohol that she digs through trash cans to finish the dregs of a bottle of booze (as is seen in the film). It simply is not convincing. The pain and ugliness of alcoholism never are realized. Since the agony and horrible consequenses of being an active and then recovering alcoholic are the basis of the entire dramatic ""impact"" of the film, I kept waiting for the problem to get bad enough for me to care. It never did."
3,Andy Garcia!,"Ever since seeing Ocean's 11, I have thought that Andy Garcia is a good actor, and that's true in this movie as well.Though it did a decent job of representing the behavior of an alcoholic, the personification was WAY OFF! Meg Ryan's healthy skin and hair just weren't realistic.I did like the movie, and I'd venture to say that if the movie was made over someone would catch that and hire a new make-up artist."
5,great movie,"Everybody needs to watch this movie is a real life story, that you will learn from it. excellent."
4,"Very good, touching, and an important movie to watch","This movie is very well written, and has a very definate plot which pulls on your emotions. I reccomend this video to anyone, especially those who could relate to the struggle of alchoholism. Good for ages 10 and up"
5,A movie Classic,Viewed this movie years ago and decided to buy the DVD as I will watch it from time to time. Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia are great in this movie!!
4,Worthwhile and Realistic,"Story about a school worker wife and pilot husband with 2 children. Wife is an out of control alcoholic. Very realistically played out. Brought out some little know realities .. Like how the person feels when their husband/wife recovers. I disagree that this is only for people who have been exposed to alcoholism. It wakes you up to the seriousness of the problem but is not boring or ""heavy handed"" It is a good movie in it's own right.Andy Garcia is excellent, I just love him. Not only is he is so good looking and so sexy but he IS a good actor. Meg Ryan does a pretty good job but with her I never quite forget that she is acting, it's not natural ... whereas with Garcia it is sooo natural in every movie he does. I thought the scenes in Mexico and the rehab center, and in their house were particularly good.Definitely worth watching if you feel like a movie that makes you think."
3,Some Nice Original Material Here!,"Home of the Blues is a compilation of some contemporary blues artist like Jonny Lang, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray and B.B. King combined with some legendary figures like Howlin' Wolf, Slim Harpo, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. All but two of the songs, Jonny Lang's version of ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" and Robert Cray's own ""I Was Warned"" were originally recorded by the artist 30 to 40 years ago and have been remastered. With regard to the sound quality, the remastered originals sound about as good as can be expected considering most were originally recorded in mono. From a historical perspective, one may question why Jonny Lang is included at all in place of the Sonny Boy Williamson original. I suppose it has to do more with trying to lure a younger crowd to purchase the disc than anything else. Overall, not a bad compilation but also not the best I have heard."
3,Interesting ... probably nothing to it though ...,"Davis may use TONS and TONS of circumstantial evidence to build her case, but it's still an interesting one.I'm not going to rehash the material that others have already gone through; I just wanted to point out the biggest question that Davis never seems to answer. If all or any of this is true, why would either the Clinton or Bush administrations sit on this and do nothing? What could they possibly have had to gain by not acting on this information if it was credible?The only logical answer is that Davis's theory isn't credible and our government knows a little more about the finer details of this investigation then the public does. Which isn't really an unreasonable assumption.Still ... I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy, just be careful how seriously you take any of this. More then likely, t's all just conjecture."
1,Jayna Davis has NO credibility,Why do you think she got fired from her job at KFOR in OKC in the first place? She identified some poor guy as the third terrorist who had NO connection. KFOR is lucky they still have a license to operate.
1,Oh Puleezzzeee!!!,"Look, this is another badly researched conspiracy books. The links are not diffinitively diffinitive. It comes down to this, there were no links to Islamic terrorists beyond the intangible. It is just another attempt to make us feel safe that we cannot have domestic terrorists in this country. That is the same kind of ostrich reaction that gave us 9/11."
1,This Book Encourages Race Hatred,"Jayna Davis should get a ""five star review"" for doing the best job to date of encouraging race hatred in America in ""The Third Terrorist."" Don't be fooled by the shining fanfare her numerous rabid right-wing cronies have listed in their puffed-up customer reviews ... this book will only be of interest to those who believe that the US government is still harboring dead aliens somewhere in Roswell. It is a sad statement to the world of publishing that such tenuous work as Davis' can be mentioned in the same breath as investigative journalism. As I recall, McVeigh and his partner Nichols were members of the white supremacy organization called White Aryan Resistance (WAR) ... the fact that they would be collaborating with rogue Iraqi agents is utterly preposterous. Why not just say they were collaborating with aliens from Planet X-9? Don't waste your money!"
5,Finally the full story of the Oklahoma City Bombing is told,"Jayna Davis has written a terrific book. It was a pleasure to read; I read it in two evenings. It read like a novel and the story was compelling. The information about John Doe #2 (among many other threads) that was so obviously downplayed by the FBI was amazing and more than well documented. The fact that so many people saw him, could identify him and yet were ignored by the authorities at the time seems unbelievable until one looks at the testimony in the 9/11 Commission. The government did not want to deal with the international terrorist threat in 1995 and chose to sweep it under the rug. No longer! Thank you Jayna!!!!"
5,I'm convinced!,"The book reads like a proposal for a television mini-series. It begins with eye-witness accounts of the destruction of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, and then with pitbull-like tenacity, peels back the layers of coverup, obstructionism, fear, ""lost"" records, and ""deer-in-the-headlight"" responses from officialdom, to make a case that there were, indeed, Middle East masterminds behind ""mules"" Nichols and Mcveigh. The true masterminds were revealed as phony ""defectors"" who settled in Oklahoma City, host to one of the largest Muslim communities in the U.S. Were her evidence to be presented in a court of law, it would easily win a conviction of what the government, before ultimately denying any Middle East participation, referred to as ""others unknown."""
4,The Third Terrorist,"Jayna Davis has written a book that every one should read to get the real facts and not the kind that is usually covered up by the FBI and the CIA. She has dig deep into the root of the Oklahoma bombing and will tell you facts that the FBI would not tell. Its a must read- Author- ""The Day Of The Rose."
4,one point seems to have gotten past her,"Her work on a third bomber was very good and in fact, impressive. But just looking at the picture on the cover asks the question, how could one bomb create that non-symmetrical blast pattern. A closer look would say it selectively cut steel beams and that ""should"" be as impossible as our law enforcement somehow making sure no one looked for and found the obvious evidence about other bombers."
4,"Yousef and Al Quaeda, not Saddam","Jayna Davis provides compelling OKC bombing connections to between Timothy McVeigh, John Doe #2 who Davis identifies as Hussein Al Husseini, and ultimately Ramsi Yousef. Unfortunately, in a few pages, Davis abandons reason and objectivity, and wrongly concludes that Saddam was behind the bombing. The only evidence provided is that Al Husseini was a former Iraqi Republican Guard soldier. With that logic we can tie any U.S. president to the bombing, since McVeigh was also former military. Despite this flaw, there is enough detailed investigative reporting here to conclude McVeigh colluded with at least some middle extremists to produce the worst terrorist attack at that time on our soil. It is unfortunate that persons hang on to the poorest formed conclusions to advance their Saddam is behind all evil theory. If only ten years ago some of that paranoia was directed at Yousef and Al Quaeda..."
2,"Facts fascinating, writing terrible","The author has brought together facts that cry out for further investigation, and one wonders why this has not taken place. But the writing is horrific. There is no cliche, no formula that is not used. Terrorists' eyes are cunning, or filled with hatred. Numerous law enforcement people or newsmen are ""efficient,"" or prescient, or resourceful. The author cannot leave any noun unadorned. Every adjective and awful adverb in her thesaurus are displayed. This would be a poster boy for bad writing, and should be used in journalism courses in that sense. But the data are highly interesting and provocative."
5,Amazing Investigative Journalism,"I suspect that anyone who written a negative review on this book quite simply has not read the book. This must be one of the most highly documented piece of investigative journalism I have read. Well written and absolutely compelling. With scores of witnesses and a mountain of other corroborating evidence, there can be no other conclusion but that of a middle east connection. Further recent news reports (after the printing of this book), such as the foiling of terror bomb plots in the UK using the same explosive mixture as the OKC bombing make this read even more timely today. Read with a skeptical eye, and watch as the evidence speaks for itself."
4,El Dorado,"Great sequel to the Scarlet Pimpernel. More adventure awaits you, as in all of Orczy's books."
4,Yet another Christmas gift,This is a gift for a friend's daughter but I'm sure she will enjoy it immensely. The book arrived in excellent condition. Merry CHRISTmas!
4,Brilliant but slightly flawed,"Without a doubt some of the Origami designs in this book are simply spectacular and exceedingly beautiful. But the point of a book like this, in my opinion is to make it very clear to the reader how to make these. I have been doing origami for years, as a small hobby, so I am just an intermediate level folder. And I have had some trouble with the diagrams in this book - they could have been done better. Some of the branching paths are difficult to understand and some of the more important folds and processes are put into rather small diagrams which makes them hard to understand.This is a really great book and I really, absolutely love the projects but the diagrams could be better. 4 of 5."
4,David's combination of Art & folding creates a book for all,Brilliant Origami Explores many different directions that origami can go. David's ability to use the heavey folds to add character and depth to his animals gives then a feel that is absent in the more mathematical appraoches. Even his explorations into geometry have a very artistic feel.HH
5,Models with style and life,"I love this book. David Brill has achieved a style of origami that is as beautiful as it is complex. Each of his models possesses great charm, and the animals are especially evocative. These models are not only technically difficult, but they also require shaping and attention to detail in the final stages to bring the model alive. Brill goes beyond the simple ""geometry"" and ""design"" of origami to create true art.His hand drawings may be slightly difficult to follow, but once the models are within your scope the instructions will suffice. Plus they contribute to the feel of the book."
4,For Experts Only!,"Don't get me wrong here. This book has the most detailed, true to life 3-Dimensional models around, including the dragon, horse, box of cigarrettes, nut & bolt (harder than it sounds) but there are very few intermediate and beginner material. Get this book if you want to see some of the great things Origami is capable of. Get this book if you want to try some really challenging pieces of work. But don't get this book to learn how to fold paper."
3,Not bad,"Honestly, this movie is cheesy but not all that bad. No big surprises who the serial killer is though, but by the way they shoot the scene I think the director seemed to think so. Okay fight scenes spaced through-out and they do make ""Tiger-Claw"" style kung-fu look pretty vicious. Would watch if nothing else on and you want to see some pretty good action...acting isn't too great though."
4,"fabulous show, wish i were there....",still can't put down the album mas and the remix for corazon partio...excellent lyrics should make ricky and iglesias run for cover...big plus are the tradtional flamenco songs at the end...wow!
4,Definitive,This is THE book for any student studying the Channel Tunnel. Gibb draws together the views of a variety of experts including the omnipresent Vickerman and Chisholm.
4,Not for novice cookers,"I started reading, and knew I was in over my head. I believe this is probably a GREAT BOOK, and would be perfect for someone with more knowledge than me in the kitchen. 95 % of the cheeses recommended, were of the non-melting type with exotic names. (I guess I'm a melting cheese cook) I gave it 4 stars. As I said it may be a great book, but I was not able to make the recipes, other novices out there need to think this one over. I really thought about giving it 5 stars"
2,They Needed Dr. Phil in Acre,"While Robyn Young may have rigorously researched exactly who was where during the 1260s, she failed to invest similar efforts in researching the medieval mind. It doesn't really bother me when authors switch events around and monkey with chronology for the sake of a good story. What drives me insane is having characters raised on misery, disease, the Church and death, communicate with each other as though they'd just left their therapist's couch. The idea that all these knights were running around Outremer giving vent to their daddy issues and frustrated gay crushes, pining over whores with hearts of gold and crying about how they've never been loved is ridiculous. It's the very worst of touchy-feely revisionist history - trying to enforce twentieth century values on thirteenth century heroes to make them more palatable - and it's laughable."
4,An engaging and entertaining read,"The Knights Templar are all the rage right now thanks to Brown & Hanks, which is good because now authors and readers are exporing a fascinating period in history that still affects us today. Young's adventure story of young William Cambpell is historical enough to attract history buffs yet fictional enough to reach a wider audience. Young tells a very good tale and manages to show us the Crusades from both sides. She remains true to titles and formal names and has clearly done the research to make the story authentic.I gave it four stars instead of five because I think the story of the book could have been better, however the other stories more than make up for it."
3,Mildly entertaining,"Fans of historical fiction (especially ones interested in the middle ages and the crusades) will find this book to be mildly entertaining. Readers who do not share a love of the subject matter will find the book to be a disappointment.This book is well paced, and the descriptions of the environment the characters are in are vivid. However, Baybars (the Muslim leader and chief villain) is two dimensional. The authors' use of foreshadowing is about a blunt as a 20 pound sledgehammer. The action sequences are short and do not convey a sense of warfare. Whole sieges are handled in a few pages. Lastly, the offhand attempt to provide a homosexual motivation for a minor character nearly 4/5 of the way through the book felt as though the author needed to come up with some reason for the minor character's actions but could not think of one.Borrow this one from the library."
2,Disappointing....,"I generally read non-fiction, and on occasion I will read some historical fiction to get a better feel for a particular time. That was my aim with this book. Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me. At first, the book held promise, cleverly weaving back and forth between concurrent events at various locales. However, after a while the book started to lose credibility. The main plot line and main motivation for the majority of the book was an invention of the author. Also, the characters start to talk with this ""post-modern relativity"" that just doesn't fit in with the period.By the end of the book, I couldn't care less about the characters because I couldn't relate to the choices they were making. They made no sense to me, particularly when coupled with 21st century psychobabble. I have no interest in reading the sequel."
1,Romance novel riddled with false history,"I had to leave this book after only reading two-thirds of it. It started out slow and the pace never quickened. There were parts that were pretty riveting such as the Templars fighting and dying in the Holy Land. But the speculations about love interests, and abandoned families where the head of the household joins the Templars and sends his daughters to a convent were too contrived. Recent research from the Vatican archives has revealed that the charges against the Templars were false. As a matter of fact they were heroes of our civilization and only the evilness and avarice of the French king was responsible for their fall. One question has entered my mind: If these men were heretics, why would they die rather than deny Christ when they surrendered a citadel? This book is flat wrong in many areas. I would not recommend it to other readers and I do not look forward to the series envisioned by the author."
1,Save your money,"The story moves at a snail's pace - so slow it is painful. The plot is so farfetched that it is totally unbelievable. Lots of logical blunders, and at many times a use of language that seems aimed at children. Only good thing I can say is that the author seems to have read up on the crusades and knows the background for his story. I shudder to think that he is really planning to make a trilogy out of this."
5,An enjoyable read,"I found this book to be an enjoyable read.I look forward to the rest of the series; it is interesting the author gives credit where credit is due (research), and is willing to accept blame if there is any inaccuracy.This shows me that she is formidable and up front in her writing!Thank you"
4,Enthralling Historical Fiction,"Brethren is an extremely well written historical fiction packed full of adventure, excitement, horror, and love. While the overall story is extremely well done I found that the book itself began a bit slow. Once the characters have been explained and the plot is set the book takes off! Definitely a very good read."
4,For Templar devotees,"I enjoyed this first book by Robyn Young. As an historical fiction fan I found ""Brethren"" a good read with well developed characters. The story engaged the imagination well and provoked strong feelings. This story does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into the emotion, passion, prejudice, and and intolerance of those who in the name of ""religion"" judge others as unworthy/evil/heather and condemn them to death. The reading evoked strong emotions. And also increased my interest in the Templars, Cathars, and other independent religious orders of that time in history."
2,"If you liked DaVinci code, this might work for you.","I do enjoy a good escapist novel now and again. I have read the Master and Commander series by Patrick O'Brian and the Sharpe and Saxon series by Bernard Cornwell. So I was looking for something similar in Brethren. And while it does share some blood and gore with Cornwell, the story and characters do not carry as well. (Oh my, did I just set up Obadiah Hakeswill as a well-developed character? Well, in comparison perhaps.)Unfortunately for me, this book shares its style more with The DaVinci Code. So if you liked that book, try this one. For me I feel this style trades character development for a few contrived, simplistic puzzles. With such a loss I lose interest. So, two stars and looking for my adventure lit elsewhere."
4,Lifa as a knight,Describes life and paradigms of a knight in the 13th. century AD. Unravels someof the mystery surrounding Templars and Hospitallers.
2,A mixed match of characters and scenery,It was hard to picture the characters as well as the scenes despite the author's overuse of adjectives and adverbs. For example The dialogue between the main characters gave me a picture of modern day teenagers. The main character was so annoyingly weak that I did not care what happened to him at the end of this 'unnecessarily made long' story. This author has not convinced me to look forward to reading any other books written by her.
4,A great read,"If you like historical fiction this one is a great read.It is not lit book, but a book for summer reading. The author knows her stuff and it is quite detailed. As for some of negative reviews, I find them all to be dead wrong, if you dont like this book I think you should change genre."
3,RELEASE THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL!!,"The complete original of this wonderful album is from 1966 called ""Country Christmas"". Whose idea it was to release this on CD and eliminate 4 tracks (which were among the best cuts) and only include 8 is a rip off for the fans of this masterpiece. That is why I am only giving it 3 stars. Loretta gets 5 stars and more for anything but this is for the CD and not a reflection on her singing or the material...but rather the lack and omission thereof.When they release the complete original ""Country Christmas"" in CD form I'll be the first to buy and to give it 5 stars and more!!"
2,This edited compilation no longer needed,"Now that MCA has re-issued the whole 12 song album under the 20th Century Masters - Christmas Collection series, which clocks in at almost 26 minutes, there is no longer a need for this CD. I would not recomend buying this at the currect used prices listed today. I give this 2 stars, not for the music, but for the nerve of MCA to issue this album with 4 less songs and it was already a very short album with 12 songs. I have never understood this practice (RCA also did this with re-issues of albums in the 80's)."
3,HD Hitch Plug,"The plug itself is well made, but to fit my car bumper, I had to have the bracket that fits into the hitch altered. It worked beautifully until I drove into my driveway from the street and heard this screeching noise. The HD plug had hit the cement & pushed itself up into my bumper, thereby scraping the paint & making a dent into the car bumper. So I'll probably be taking it off since I don't want my car damaged anymore."
5,Silent Sigh should be huge.,"This CD contains 15 fairly decent songs and 1 song that should be recognized as one of the greatest songs ever recorded. Silent Sigh is so good, it alone merits the CD a full 5 stars. Since I've been alive (born in '72), I've owned nearly 1000 45's, about 200 albums, 50 8 Tracks, nearly 2000 tapes, and close to 3000 CD's. For several years now, I've heard of the myth of ""the perfect pop melody"". Several bands came close. The Beatles came close several times. However, I think the award for discovering the ""perfect pop melody"" goes to Badly Drawn Boy for the composition of Silent Sigh. At least buy the CD for this song."
1,CopyProtected - Unable to play on computer,Great album. Unfortuantely it appears to be copy protected and unable to play on computer systems.
4,4 and I/2 Stars One of the best soundtracks of the year.,"I haven't seen the movie but the upbeat soundtrack has some cathy tunes and it is a really enjoyable ablbum. Some Nice instrumentals and especially (Little boy Blues) Tracks 5,7,8,9, and 15 are the standouts"
5,BDB amazes me,"this was my 1st bdb cd, and i have had it for awhile now but i choose to write a review now, my about a boy cd is currently in bad condition and iam gonna get a new copy right away, this cd is just a masterpeice and damon gough is a genius, from all three albums that i own i cannot figure out which one is the best they are all so great,i would reccomend all his albums to any real music lovers , i can only hope for more from him , iam sure it will only get better from here, IF U THINK THIS ALBUM SUCKS , THEN GO LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID LINKIN PARK AND WATCH YOUR PRECIOUS MTV"
4,More listener friendly than its predecessor,"Let me first say that I gave this album 4 stars despite it having one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my entire life. Want to know which one? I'm sure you can figure out for yourself once you listen to it, but it's S.P.A.T. That song is just awful. Other than that song, it is amazing. It's not as daring and experimental as Bewilderbeast, but it's still great. The best song is by far ""A minor incident."" It's a very folksy song with a bit of english pop to it. You should buy this album as soon as possible."
3,What about the song they play during the commerical?,"It's not on the soundtrack, am I right? Does anyone know what I'm talkingabout?"
3,Movies Like This Create Anxiety for Me,"I recognize that ""The Remains of the Day"" is a beautifully executed movie, with great acting and ambience, but it's the story line that upsets me. Unrequited love that really STAYS unrequited distresses me. I just wanted to bonk Anthony Hopkins over the head! Suppose it comes too close for home for me. I guess if you're made of stronger stuff than I, then you'll enjoy ""The Remains of the Day"" fully."
5,A classic!,Great movie came fast in great shape. This is a classic that can be watched over and over again. Highly recommend it!
5,REMAINS OF THE DAY,I love anything that Anthony Hopkins does is this is no exception. British films & television programs are the best. I had already seen this film numerous times before I purchased it & it's just as good as the first time I watched it. Excellent film! This is a definite keeper.
5,Don't buy this for the movie alone.,"But buy it for the commentary provided by Emma Thompson, Ismail Merchant and James Ivory! First, the movie is a wonderful period piece set in pre-WWII England at the manor of an English Lord with his staid and emotionally distant butler and the recently hired young head maid. The acting, not only of the main characters but also for all involved, is well done with the only weak spot when the German lady is singing (dubbed actually) and her acting also appears to be somewhat forced. Other than that I don't see how the acting in the movie could have been any better if at all. Secondly, along with the other extras there is the commentary provided by Thompson, Merchant and Ivory during the movie as they discuss the preparations for the scenes and the obstacles they encountered in making the film but most of all the lighthearted banter between them is at times hilarious and revealing. Buy it for the movie and the commentary! You will be glad you did!"
2,Volume too low!,When playing the DVD the voices were nearly inaudible. I had to turn the volume to maximum and even then it was difficult to understand the words in quite a few places.Guests watching the DVD agreed that the problem was significant.
2,Remains of nothing,"I'm a big Anthony hopkins fan. He never fails to live up to or exceed the limitations of any script put in front of him. As a butler in white ivory England the only thing expected of him was to play the role of a butler with supressed emotions. This of course is expected of any manservant. keep your opinions to yourself even if called upon to express them. Do your job. Boy thats a walk in the park for Anthony Hopkins to play a stone faced butler with a whisper or two of facial emotion While Emma Thompson (head maid) subtley attempts to get him to express them , but in such a boring fashion. It's not her fault and it's not Anthony hopkins fault.The script is boring. There's no drama, nigh but a hint of emotion. No love, not even a whisper of a thrill. Nothing but boring lines of conversation. No heart ache, no close friendship developing. Not even a happy or sad ending.It begins and ends on the same note. BORING SCRIPT and good acting. No plot."
3,The Remains of the Day,"The acting is good, but the story is slow and boring. The movie skips past World War II as though it were a minor conflict. The timeline jumps around a lot without any warning."
3,Needs more whiskey.,"Don't get me wrong, the cast is strong, the performances are commendable, but the movie starts out slow and never gets very interesting. I was asked to watch this class for an ethics class. The only message I could derive from this film was that adhering to a strict code of ethics will leave you old, sad, and regretful. On the upside, you'll also be Sir Anthony Hopkins, but an old sad SAH."
5,The Remains Of The Day,"I absolutely loved The Remains of The Day! I love Anthony Hopkins in anything he does! I loved it so much, that I also ordered the book."
5,Powderham Castle,"September 2012, my wife and I visited England on holiday. One stop was at Powderham Castle during a genealogical tour with Courtney-related members from around the globe. At the castle, we learned that a scene from the movie ""Remains of the Day"" was filmed. I had seen the movie some years ago and upon returning home purchased my own copy. Sure enough, there was the scene that we saw while standing in the castle. Even the credits listed Powderham Castle as a location site. Reality brought much joy."
2,Remains of the Day,Received the DVD very quickly however it was loose in the dvd jacket. It had a scratch on it. Don't know if it affected the performance because I haven't inquired about it. Hopefully it's ok. This was supposedly a new product.
2,another film showing the obssession with nazis and Jews,"Another WWII based film about Jews and nazis. The ""day to day"" was about the servants at an English mansion of course. But the Jewish/nazi stereotypes were from beginning to end and the basis for all the turns in the plot. It has already been told MANY times. Also it appears you can't have a mainstream American British movie without the stock rich American interjected into the film (booooo). I thought this was about English servants and the way of life. It was kinda, in a way. But even that was muddled with weirdness. Anyway the acting was good of course. But I am sick of movies about such jews being killed by nazis and rich Americans running all over Europe (like we are all rich) all throughout time."
2,BORRRRIIIIINNNNG!!!!,"I'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever tried to sit through. Don't be fooled by artsy film snobs, this one is a snoozer. And oh by the way, the tenacious ""loyalty, devotion and integrity"" of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film, is in my opinion, distracting and ridiculous."
2,Waste of time,"If you want to waste an afternoon buy or rent this movie. I had seen this movie a few times in my younger years and decided to revisit it in hopes that I would understand more. I consider myself a remotely scholarly person and have been forced to read many boring classical novels, mythology and blah blah. Remains of the Day, I am sure, has some audience out there that can appreciate it, but I do not recommend it for at least 95% of the media/reading population. Good luck."
1,The remains of the Day,"I thought this the MOST BORING movie of all times! Gag me! Two great stars, dull movie."
3,Pierce's first solo effort,"This album was originally released in the UK in the mid 80s. This CD reissue is its first US release. The songs here show a tamer and less bluesy side of Pierce that what you hear on the better Gun Club albums. The songs and the guitar work here are often reminiscent of Television, and sometimes of Pere Ubu. The bonus tracks feature Pierce doing something like a William Burroughs impersonation, to no apparent purpose."
1,Not worth the low low price of free,"This magazine perfectly reflects the American attitudes toward child-rearing. It ""mentions"" breastfeeding, but it's only a token mention. In the very next paragraph is information that contradicts all the fundamentals of breastfeeding. Sleeping through the night no later than 4 months?? Breastfed babies often need an overnight feeding through their ninth month. This is just one example. I don't care that this magazine is free or only a few dollars a year. I will not be bringing this useless pile of crap into my house anymore."
1,Phone number and address to unsubscribe from American Baby Magazine,"Just received my second unsolicited magazine from American Baby. I have no use for it and am not interested in it. Circular advised that if I did not want it, I should go on website and cancel. This was an exercise in futility, as there was no option to cancel. I tried several times. Finally googled and found a phone number and talked to a Customer Svc Representative, who tells me I may receive it for one more month, but that I would be dropped from mailing list. However, I have read another review that says it is impossible to get dropped from the list.. . .so I will wait and see what happens. Hopefully, this will be the end of the unsolicited magazine. Here is the contact information: 1-800-678-1208 and/or 1-515-247-2987. Address is: 805 3rd Avenue, 24th Floor, New York NY 10022. Good luck! Elaine"
4,Packed Full of Usefull Info,I read several baby magazines and this by far was my favorite. Especially for the first time mothers. There's lots of questions during baby's first year of life and this magazine specifically addresses that age! It's a great gift to give to first time parents as well.
1,"Don't need, don't want...please stop.","I am a 69 year old woman who NEVER subscribed to this magazine. Now, no matter how many phone calls that I make to get them to unsubscribe they refuse to abide by my wishes. Ridiculous!"
5,Perry Mason Season 2 Volume 2,I just love Raymnod Burr. Perry Mason is just fantastic. What more can I say.. keep them coming
4,Perry Mason Season 2,"This series is extremely well done and always surprises when the villian is identified. Compared to the current TV lineup, this series is by far more enjoyable, and far more watchable.WDFFt. Myers, FL"
5,Perry Mason television series,Any fan of Raymond Burr and Perry Mason will love these old black and white television episodes. I own all that have been released so far and highly recommend them.
1,CBS Screws Up Again With Producing DVDs,"The only reason I give this box set one star is because I can't watch it EXCEPT on my computer. For 4 1/2 seasons' worth, I've enjoyed these episodes on my Dynex flat screen. But - and I've had this experience with several other CBS DVDs, for some reason there is some glitch in these DVD discs where they cannot play on my TV set. So BEWARE! I will not purchase another CBS set of DVDs unless I test them at the store first, which is, of course, impossible. I LOATHE playing DVDs on my computer, which I use for - dare I mention it - work.LET THE BUYER BEWARE. CBS IS GUILTY."
3,Disappointing,"First of all, let me say that I am dyed-in-the-wool Perry Mason fan. I have every other release of the Perry Mason DVD Series. I watch them over and over- they never lose their appeal. This selection, I have to admit, has caused me some disappointment. I don't know if they had different writers for this group of series, or what happened. I find that the stories are lacking the snap and ""cutting edge"" the others have. I feel it is the story lines and NOT the actors that are at fault. In the past episodes, the stories have been clean and even suspenseful! These, I feel, fall short of the traditional flow. It's like eating over-cooked oatmeal. No ummph. I'm hoping that the next selection of episodes that may be released will be more like the earlier versions. Full of snap, clean and sharp!"
1,perry mason year 2 dvd's,"I have no complaints about the quality of the dvd reproductions of the episodes. they're great! the problem is that during the 2nd season, they did 39 episodes; the two dvd's for the 2nd season have 30 episodes! The 1st season dvd's gave you 5 dvd's; now, you're only getting 4 dvd's and you ""lose"" one episode for Paramount Previews of other series (NOT Perry!); I only hope we're NOT down to 3 dvd's when season 3 appears."
5,The Case Is Dismissed,"Well, I suppose like one of Mason's cases, the DVDs had to end, but I hope the uniformly positive reviews of Seasons 1 and 2 would encourage the release of the remaining seasons. I, for one, would not hesitate in purchasing them, since, as I remember, the episodes became more dramatic, the courtrooms became larger and the acting and screenplays became even more gripping. At the end, even color came to the series. One can only hope the wait won't be long. As I finish this review, I hear the theme song, ""Park Avenue Beat,"" playing over and over again in my mind."
2,Crystal Visions - The Very Best of Stevie Nicks,"Rating CD Only: I feel that Stevie Nicks is a great talent, but The CD sounds very flat. There's no pizzazz to it; boring to listen to. This in no way reflects on the artist, it reflects on the way the CD was produced, remixed or whatever."
5,Cd/Dvd..Great Way To Go!!!!!,"First,love Stevie.She is one of my all-time faves.Bought her first collection back then.Probably would have bought the new cd,but not right away. With the DVD,it made me buy it right away.Being she made the coolest vids.The newer versions of ""Dreams"" and ""Rock n Roll"" were awesome!!!! The combo is highly recommended.Look forward to a new cd of originals.Love you Stevie."
4,Love Stevie,The CD is good for Stevie's own music. And it is worth what I paid here. She can write and sing with the best of them. But honestly I like Fleetwood mac and both of them together.
5,donwjacks take,this album is very good it has everything if you love stevie like I do and it sounds nice on some dolby speakers.
1,Did not get what I ordered,"I just received my shipment and instead of a CD I received a DVD. It was not even the real thing but rather a copy. No original cover, nothing. The DVD won't even play on my DVD, computer, or any other device. I am so upset about this and want my money back."
3,Long time waiting,I had to wait a long time for this cd to arrive. Still not sure if I like all the tracks on this cd as I think they remixed a couple of them. It still takes me back in time with a singer that I really like!
4,Stevies still great,Stevie still sounds great. Nice Cd to hear her great hits. songs not quite as good as with Fleetwood Mac
5,I've been waiting for this!,"I've been a Stevie fanatic since she began with Fleetwood Mac, so anything new from Stevie is a must buy.The live version of Edge of 17, from Australia, is excellent.But the true greatness of this package is the DVD. To see the videos again is priceless and to see the much talked about Civil War Epic version of Stand Back is truly awesome."
5,Fantastic,All of her best songs are on this one album. She has been my favorite female rock singer for many years
4,"Good music, bad videos","Pros:1. Live version of Edge of 17 is the reason to own this CD/DVD.2. Live version of Rock and Roll is also really good, and will be new to many fansCons:1. No new original songs2. We've all seen these videos before! I was majorly disappointed with the videos, and had hoped for some live performances from the Enchanted or TISL tour. Instead, Stevie included all the ones we can we already see on YouTube or VH-1. It's nice to hear her talk about them, but some of the videos are more than 20 years old!"
3,Stevie Nicks-Crystal Visions,"It's alright, especially if you have no Stevie Nicks product. If you have the boxset Enchanted and the Best of...Timespace, then pass GO and go straight to them. No purpose in this product other than a concert tour tie in and you can purchase this along with tickets to her show currently running. I saw her this week in Albuquerque along with my teenage daughter whom kept me grounded when she said she was just 'plain vanilla'...and why does she change costumes so often when they each look the same? AND can you tell me why her concert tee shirts are $35 and $45??? This CD is only for beginners, training wheels not necessary."
2,recycled,"She needs to get off her butt and record something new, and I don't mean recycled old songs in concert. Apparantly Stevie no longer has the burning desire to record her songs anymore, the initial reason she stepped away from Fleetwood Mac in 1981, because she supposedly wrote so much music. That appears to be no longer true. The live versions waaste space. Do we really need more live versions of Rhiannon, Landslide & Edge of Seventeen? No."
4,Stevie Rocks!!,"I love the DVD with this set. It has older videos of Stevie's music--always great to watch & listen too. The CD has a lot of her songs that I already have on other CD's, but, hey--who can ever get enough of Stevie?? It's a nice addition to my collection."
5,crystal visions,"One of the best Stevie Nicks albums, this one makes you wish you could meet her in person. Similiar to Timespace but better on arrangements."
5,Stevie is in a class all her own.,"Best of the Best, her music still touches my soul as it did years ago...she is a wonderful artist always true to her self."
5,Great to have must own for die hards,"The video makes it worth it and there are some new versions of a few songs.I bought this because I am a huge fan, and the reviews said you gotta see the dvd. The inside look in her own words is a really nice thing and I thing it also clears up misconceptions some people seem to have about her music. Stevie Nicks is a great artist and there will never be another like her. I highly reccomend this disk set, even if you have some of these songs."
5,Clay is the best performer EVER,I have yet to hear the entire Cd but the songs I have heard are typical Clay straight from the heart songs about love and heartbreak. He is the best performer I have ever met and genuine down to earth nice guy. I have been waiting for this Cd since the first time I heard the song She's Always Right.
5,Love This CD!,"Really love this CD by Clay Walker, it's my favorite. I couldn't find this CD anywhere in stores and haven't been able to for quite some time. This is one of my dad's favorite Clay Walker CDs as well and he's lost it twice! Got this for him for Christmas, hopefully he doesn't lose it again!"
4,GRANDSTAFFS RECOMENDATIONS,"THIS FINE ALBUM BY CLAY WALKER WAS VERY NICE TO LISTEN TO....WALKERS SONGS ALWAYS GIVE A GOOD MESSAGE TO LIVE BY...BUT HIS MESSAGE IN ""CHAIN OF LOVE"" IS WONDERFUL, AND EVERYONE SHOULD TRY TO FOLLOW THE STORY THAT CLAY TELLS AND BE LIKE ""JOE"""
5,"Everyone should read. Solid argument in simple terms. Thank you, Sir.","Mr.Brussee,Thank you for writing this book. Encourage everyone to read. If you and Dave Ramsey were taugh in high school, consumer debt would be nill (and unemployment would likely rise because folks would stop buying things they want vs need =)Enjoy the Social Security money that Gen X's like myself pay but will not see =)Debt free and living on 12.435% of take-home pay,Shawn EldridgeBusiness Intelligence Consultant"
3,Labor of Love,"One would expect a substantial number of facts and figures with a work like this. But in the opinion of this reviewer, the preponderence of same actually bogged this vital book down. Not for the average reader who lacks a basic understanding of economics. An aptitude for mathematics would also help someone to digest this material."
2,Too many Charts,"It was ok. Too many charts. The first part of the book was great, then it was all charts on what kind of return you can get on investments."
5,Excellent book. No frills. Just facts and a solid analysis.,"Warren Brussee has not recieved the credit he deserves for so correctly predicting the current condition of our economy.I read this book in August of 2007 and have been keen on the developments in our economy ever since.I highly advise everyone to read this book. Its explanations are concise, the conclusions are derived from real data, and the predictions have been spot on."
2,Very cheaply made,"I purchased this after christmas so I know that I got a great deal on it, but if you are paying more than $5 for it, you are WASTING your money. The fabric is very thin and cheap. If you were to spend 25, I'd say spend 40 and get it directly from disney where it's actually a much heavier robe."
4,NOT what is Pictured!!!!,"I paid under $5 for this item, and am happy with what I received for $5. I expected that I would NOT get what was pictured, and I, in fact, did not (like everyone else).The robe I received does NOT tie in the front as shown. If you view the same robe in medium, that robe DID tie in the front.For $5 it is worth it . . . for much more, I would not waste your money."
3,Good for the price,"Well for the price that has, it is not of very good quality, though I hope that to my son it lasts. It is realistic enough, and to complement the disguise this one well."
1,Misleading,It's JUST the robe. Not the whole costume like the picture would lead you to believe.The robe IS NOT the one pictured and does not cinch in the front.
4,fit the description,"the only thing different from the picture is that the hood did not cinch in the front -- there are sleeves to wear that keep it on. that made it difficult to get the hood to stay up, but it still worked for my halloween costume."
3,just a good robe,"Good quality, but if you see the package photo you think it is a costume, but is just the Robe, you need more accessories to get a Jedi costume"
2,Not worth the money!,"As previous reviewer said, this is ROBE ONLY. Not a full costume. Very cheap material (granted most kid costumes are) but thought there would be a little more to it."
4,really great for the price,"This is a qualified 4 stars. I paid less than$5 for this. It is just the brown robe and made of thin, cheap fabric. However I could not have made this for anywhere close to the price I paid. My 8 year old loves it, he pretends to be a Jedi or a wild west sheriff."
1,It's just a robe as in the dark brown part only!,I gave this to my 9 year old on her birthday as she was having a Star wars party and wanted this costume this is NOT a costume!! Its just a robe the photo is misleading! Way to spoil a kids birthday guys! the value and quality on this product is about $2 worth
3,Below expectations,My expectations were higher for the product. It turned out to be polyester blend that loo poorly made. The important thing was that my son was happy and knew no different
3,Jedi Robe,"I was excited about the costume and thought the pricing was really great until it came. I missed the fact that I was only buying the robe. I assumed you got the whole set up instead of just the robe. When it arrived we were disappointed but my daughter was able to borrow the parts of the costume to complete the Jedi knight look, so we had a good Halloween experience in spite of it."
3,just OK,"Bought this to go with the Anakin Skywalker costume because my Star Wars fan insisted that every good Jedi needs a robe. It was typical Halloween costume material, thin hastily made. That would be fine but the hood was shaped weird and didn't sit on his head correctly."
3,"Robe is good, the picture and description is misleading","The first thing my 6yr old boy shouted out after he opened the package was they are cheating, not a complete set. And then he pointed the costume under the robe in the picture. It's not a surprise to me but I agree with the young man. Nothing said the white costume is sold separately as they do with the lightsaber."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed that its not the robe shown and it has no closure. Be warned when purchasing its not what's pictured
3,Multi uses are possible,"With this robe, my son can wear it on Halloween, for a school play, or just for make-believe games at home. He enjoyed wearing it and looked great."
3,Robe of loose threads and sheerness,"If you are like me and my wife: no time to buy fabric and make it yourself, then this is what you will get. A ready made robe for your young Jedi that is made of the same fabric stockings are made of.Quality is definitely not synonymous with this item. I feel bad though. For writing all bad about this product though.We got 4 good trick or treat events in October out of it. But I must say the threads are showing and unraveling. It has a sort of runs in a pantyhose look now and it served its purposes."
3,JEDI costume,I just got the ROBE - it was a little misleading to say ROBE COSTUME. It should have just said ROBE only in the title.The stitching is also coming undone.
2,ITS ONLY A ROBE,"It was misleading...it is ONLY a robe...they go to the trouble to say light saber sold separately, they should have said COSTUME sold separately too!"
2,Misleading Picture!,"Thought this costume would come as in picture, with the pants, tunic, belt and boots. The picture is very misleading. It was a disappointment both for me as for my 11 year old son."
3,Good--just not Kipling,"Admittedly, I liked the Jungle Book as a kid. It had cute characters, catchy songs, and of course, the Disney label.However, after having re-read Kipling's classic, I can not say that this film is true to the original story. The characters, most notably Baloo, the elephant army, and Kaa, have lost their nobility, and have come off as buffoonish. Then, too, there is no talk of ""the laws of the jungle,"" which was so important to the original story. Finally, Mowgli's original conflict is diminished. In the Kipling stories, Mowgli returns to the man-village because the wolf-pack, led by outsider Shere Khan, has turned on him. It's a cute movie, but in the end, it won't be joining my collection."
1,the jungle book,my advice is - dont bother! this dvd is exacty it`s the same as the vhs version! .it is NOT dolby surround as stated but only stereo and there are no extras on the disc at all.the colour and sound are the same as the vhs version-not re-mastered or enhanced at all for dvd.if you have it on vhs dont waste your money!
1,Limited Issue Dvd Is so much better than this new one,I have the limited issue of this dvd.Then i bought the new one and sent it back.They made this dvd into widescreen and ruined the entire movie.They chopped of the heads of some of the character's.Give this dvd a One -
2,Another Disney money making venture,"I agree with some of the other reviews - especially that the DVD does not offer anything more! In fact, the VHS copy I have has a ""Making of"" which is not on the DVD! Disney has priced this DVD too high with nothing extra. The movie itself is classic and if you don't have it on VHS, get it on DVD. Still, I feel Disney is milking too much out of these limited re-issues; at the very least they could include extra features on the DVDs (I bet they will issue special edition DVDs down the road so that we will have to buy another copy!)."
1,Disappointment,"the only good thing about me buying the movie is that I got my money back. I bought it ""new"" and it never worked..."
2,FAKE,Happy came in nice package brand new disk but i wish they would have told me they were fake. There cheaper at the flea market
4,sing along,my daughter sang the songs for 3 days after we saw the movie! i forgot what a great story it is!
3,Memories...,"I remember this movie as being better than it really is. It's a classic to be sure, but it doesn't hold up well - technically. The pace is odd. The comic timing is terrible. This was the last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney and it kind of shows his older sensibilities. It felt a little 'phoned in'.I will always have fond memories of this movie, but I may not watch it too frequently so I don't dilute those memories.The DVD is top notch. Great quality, great sound, excellent extras."
3,Great DVD poor packaging.,My kid loves it and watches over and over. I don't like all the singing but that is just personal preference. The slip case was damaged but not worth returning since the DVD was protected in the plastic clamshell case.
4,Excellent for kids (and adults too),Just purchased this DVD... its really good... my daughter(2 yr old) likes it a lot... will be buying the next versions for sure....As always got the package on time and in perfect condition from Amazon...
3,The Jungle Book by Phil Harris,-Not my favotite. It never was. I guess it just never caught my intrest. Similar to Tarzan and a wild jungle type of book.
5,Who could resist Disney's Jungle Book?,"Not this video watcher and I'm guessing you couldn't either.""You see it true... someone like me can learn to be human too...""I have always loved this video just as my children enjoy Jungle Book. A great Disney classic for people of all ages. My kids and I dance in the living room with Baloo and King Loui. Breath heavy with Bagheera as he tries to steer Mowgli and Baloo in a safe direction and shudder a the oh so viscous Sheer Con as he tracks them through the jungle. Don't forget the adorable crooning vultures that are just waiting for something to do... on a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10 for timeless entertainment and family favorites."
5,Disney at its best!,"This is my favorite Disney movie, and the only one I own. Jungle Book is a fun, timeless story with fantastic songs that stay in your head for days. It's truly enjoyable for both kids and adults. They don't make them like this any more!"
4,Expensive but somewhat worth it.,"I bought this as a holiday gift for a family member who loves this movie. It comes with a DVD and packed with special features. But, I wish it wasn't so expensive or that Disney would finally release it on Blu-Ray and make it work the absorbent price I payed for the purchase."
5,Are you enjoying this??,"It's an iconic Disney film and as an adult, it makes me laugh so hard. I love these films. Get yours.."
5,Still Special after 40 years....,"Disney's latest addition to its platinum DVD series is its 1967 classic, ""The Jungle Book"". Many reviewers have complained about the widescreen transfer of the film for this new DVD - I'm not. Having both the platinum release and the original limited issue '99 disc, the sound and picture quality of the new edition towers over its imperfections. A worthy addition to the platinum DVD collection."
5,outstanding,"The Jungle Book movie is outstanding. It's more wonderful than I remembered. I bought it for myself and not my grandchildren, though they will aprreciate too. It brought back wonderful memories of the actors who supplied the voices for movie. Unlike today's animated movies, there were no suggestive or toilet humor in it. I'll watch this over and over again it's so good."
5,Well done. I enjoy,"I mean its a repeat of what existed, so how excited can I get. But the price was right. Haven't looked at the second bonus disc yet so I got nothing to say on that."
4,Classic,I enjoyed the Jungle Book as a child and now my own kids can have that same experience. Good quality & fun story & songs.
4,As good as ever,"My little one loved the video. We havent watched the specials yet, but the movie and songs caught her attention for sure!"
3,Disappointing version of a GREAT film!,"I bought a better version of this on VHS. I couldn't even play it on my computer DVD player. I believe it was an import.But on a better note, this is one of my top two favorite Disney movies, next to Aladdin. And the main reason this disappointed was the missing special feature. It was a documentary about the creative process and this being Walts last movie. He died during the making of.If you can buy one with better features, I HIGHLY recommend this film.Five stars for the film. One star for this copy."
1,jungle book,"We had a change of address for the receiver immediately after purchasing the DVD. I sent 3 e-mails to let the sender know, but have never received anything back from him. The purchase has never arrived to the recepiant. I am still wondering about it. Would sure like to know how to handle this."
4,Great Movie For Kids,"This is a great movie for kids, but not teens or adults. Deffinatly do not buy it for anybody over 10 years old at the most. It's good other wise."
5,"Cute Characters, Great Songs and Sweet Story Make this a Disney Classic","Though it diverges wildly from the the original story by Rudyard Kipling Disney's THE JUNGLE BOOK is one of the mouse's best classic animated musical movies. The voice actors are excellent and the songs are clever, memorable and move the story forward. There is enough action and humor for adults to enjoy the movie and though there are villains they are not too scary for the little ones. All ends happily though bittersweetly."
3,A bit Disappointed with Amazon,"I am a bit disappointed with Amazon. The movie and case are fine, but it didn't come with a slip cover that all of the copies have in the stores. It was more convenient for me to place an order with Amazon, but if I'd known they wouldn't be including the nice anniversary edition slipcover one-- I would have bought it at Target as it was the same price."
5,Disney's Jungle Book gets A+,The movie came new-exactly as described. It was shipped fast. Excellent transaction. The movie is a classic and one adults and children alike will love for generations to come.
5,Classic,This is always going to be considered a classic by adults and children every where. Love the story and all the characters.
3,Excellent behind the scenes information about how the film was made but did not include the film so I am disappointed.,"The cover and package did not tell me which one had the best copy of the film on it and I made the mistake of assuming the film as well as the behind the scenes review would be on the commemorative version, it was note so the recipient of my gift was disappointed but it was very nice to see the background just not what she requested for Xmas."
5,best disney movie ever,"the music, the characters, the lines, the dvd extras! our family has seen a lot of disney, but this movie is at the top of the heap."
5,It's just a bare necessity!,"The feature-length cartoons Disney continues to produce are fine films, but nowhere near as good as classics like The Jungle Book. Unburdened by the modern-day Disney habit of giving every film a heavy family-friendly moral message, the Jungle Book is just 100% pure fun, with a cool hero (Mowgli), entertaining friends (especially the bear Baloo) and some great villainous characters (most memorably Shere Khan the tiger). This movie was made years before Phil Collins or Elton John were drafted in as cartoon soundtrack composers, and the songs are just awesome - ""The Bare Necessities"", ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Kaa the snake's hissed encouragement to ""Trust in Me"". Get this DVD while you can!"
1,This is terrible!,They cropped (or left out) the top and bottom of the picture to accommodate the new wide screen Tvs. Not good! This makes the earlier release on DVD an instant collectors item. It's a shame too because the rest of the restoration is beautiful. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave to see how they mangled one of his masterpieces. Give us the movie as it was originally intended please.
1,Highly dissatisfied,"While the Jungle Book remain one of my Disney favourites from my childhood days, watching this cropped version virtually killed all the magic that was in the movie. I was so distracted by all the cropped heads and feet there was no way I could concentrate on the plot. So much of the background and scenery was lost that it just threw the scenes off balance. Why even call this a platinum edition when the original 1.37.1 aspect ration was not preserved? Isn't that what a platinum edition is all about? Ever see a cropped Picasso or Van Gogh? This is the worst Disney release to date and I would hesitate buying another Disney release if they are all going to turn out this way. A total waste of money. Disney should refund or offer to replace all discs from dissatisfied customers."
3,"Jungle book, a good movie but not a great one.","Now before you die hards spew fire at me for giving this movie three stars let me explain myself. Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid childrens film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for childrens films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own. Just not as good as Peter Pan or Mary Poppins in this consumers honest opinion."
1,i havent gotten the movie,i never got the video i bought when will i be able to recieve this movie its been longer than 1month already
1,"(Platinum) Great Movie, RIDICULOUS DVD","I purchased the Platinum Edition. This was one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen made. It had numerous problems in every one of my 6 different dvd players and computers throughout the house. When it did work, in EVERY one it would alternate about once a second between great picture quality and a pixelated grid-like pattern. It made me seriously get a headache. The very mechanics of the DVD seem flawed. I am not going to pin this on the seller and get my money back from them, but I WILL be contacting Disney and seeing if I can get a refund through them. I am going to purchase the limited edition to see if it is better. I LOVE this movie."
1,DVD skips in multiple spots - Defective Product,"The DVD arrived on time and the disc and packaging looked fine, but the disc skips and has severe pixelization in multiple spots. Eventually the image will freeze up and the DVD needs to be restarted from the beginning. I've tried this disc in multiple DVD players with the same results. Defective product"
5,One of the greatest animated films,Man....King Louie's music bit is the best. This movie is superb. Ahead of it's time.
5,The Jungle Book,I absolutely love Dinsey movies and the Jungle Book was one of the best with a great story line. This story can let children viewing this movie understand different perspectives to Mowgli's situation. This movie will be shared with all of my neices and nephews during the upcoming holidays.
1,Horrendous adaptation of a Kipling classic,"As a long-time fan of Kipling's original The Jungle Book, I can't stomach this Disney drivel. Kipling's Mowgli is brave, competent, and completely adapted to life in the jungle. His Kaa is Mowgli's friend and protector. His Shere Khan is a fool.Disney twisted the story to make Mowgli naive and helpless. The only moment in the movie that (almost) rings true is Mowgli's attraction to the human girl at the end -- but in the novel, this only happens when Mowgli becomes a man. In the book Mowgli is driven back to man by traitorous members of the wolf pack, but returns to the jungle after killing Shere Khan and being rejected by his fellow humans. I recommend that anyone who enjoys the movie read the book and find out what they've been missing."
1,I never received my video of the Jungle Book,"I never received my video and I'm not sure where it is? I would like to know what steps should I take now. Thank you,Jani Franco"
5,No Complaints/Color matches well with Cuisinart Toaster,"This coffeemaker is great. The ""red"" color, matches the Cuisinart CPT-120R ""red"" toaster, almost exactly!! We are trying to ""heat"" up the kitchen and add a little excitement by bringing in the red. We have much inspiration now!! We have had it a month, we have no complaints, makes a great cup of coffee!!Tommy and Debbie Harris"
4,Jungle Book,"This dvd copy was used but was in excellent shape. It arrived as expected and since it was a limited edition and hard to find, I was especially glad to acquire a copy."
1,Item never sent,"I have yet to receive this item. I have tried to contact the seller several times with no response. I will not buy from them again, if this is how they choose to do their business."
2,almost always objective,"Gordon Fee is a skilled exegete, and this is a good commentary. But when he reaches 1 Cor 11 or 12:13 he forgets to be an expositor of God`s Word and he follows his Zwinglian tradition. For example he says that I Cor 12:13 isn`t about the sacrament of Baptism, but Fee doesn`t prove that Paul taugh two baptisms: the so called water baptism and the Spirit Baptism. Paul teaches One Baptism on Ephesians 4. Fee only forgot this.His commentaries on 1 Cor 12:13 shows how acrobatic an exegete can be, and the fantastic mind games he can play when he follows his tradition instead of the Bible. Read Baptism in the NT by George Beasley Murray."
5,Great Resource,"Fee is brilliant, and gives great insight into the text. I read this commentary as part of a course on I Corinthians, and will use it in the future as a resource for teaching."
4,Good commentary,Fee does a great Job of explaining the text from an evangelical point of view. He gives a in depth understanding of the text while not bogging down in scholarly elements that are confusing. I do not have any greek background training yet the commentary presented no problems for me. The only objections I have come in chapters 12-14 where his charismatic leanings are clearly evident. A conservative who doesn't believe that tongues are part of today's Christian life would disagress with Fee's interpretation of chapters 12-14. In Chapter 14 Fee considers verses 34-35 to be a scribal addition instead of part of the text. In my view this is a circuitous way of sidestepping the issue of women in the churcn. Overall the book will be a blessing to those who love the Lord Jesus Christ.
2,Don't expect much,I didn't really care for this video. I expected much more from the reviews and description.
5,polygamy,"This is a real documentary from someone who has lived it. It's a very rare glimpse into the secretive world that few experience. Laurie Alan is a surviver and her film BANKING ON HEAVEN is a testimant to what she herself has lived and escaped. Polyamy is still alive throughout the new west today and this film shows the harsh truth of what happens on the inside. It is an honest and eye opening work, and an inspiring piece of filmmaking."
3,That Christmas Feeling,"I purchased this cassette tape many years ago in college. I am a tremendous Bing Crosby fan, yet I was disappointed with the quality of this album. First, Bing Crosby is featured on Side A only, and Rosemary Clooney is featured on Side B. Although there are a few lovely duets with other popular artists, the recording quality is below average. Also, since this is a later recording, Bing's voice has lost a bit of its richness. If you are looking for a general Bing Crosby Christmas album, try another title. However, if you are looking for lesser-known tracks of his Christmas music, this is the album for you."
1,Terrible Quality,"The sound recordings on this album are terrible. There are far better versions of the same songs on just about any other Bing and Frank album. I am a fan, and was very disappointed."
5,That Crosby Feeling,"This album features Christmas songs that were not included on Bing Crosby'sMerry Christmasalbum (a.k.a.White Christmas). This is a terrific selection of Yuletide classics. Another CD by Bing is entitledThe Voice of Christmas, and he really is. His singing on these songs exudes a warmth that is lacking from many other singers. It doesn't say it on the CD, but ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" and ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" are duets with the delightful Andrews Sisters. This CD is out of print, but it shouldn't be too hard to find a used copy. I recommend that you do so."
1,Avoid This CD,"Like most people, I believe Bing Crosby IS Christmas music. However, the sound quality of That Christmas Feeling is very poor. While it costs a little more, Bing Crosby's The Voice of Christmas: The Complete Decca Christmas Songbook has much, much better sound quality (as well as a greater selection of songs)--I highly recommend it."
2,"Great Music, but...","I bought this because I love the music, and because it's played by Tafelmusik. But like another reviewer, I haven't been able to watch much of it. The singing and playing are wonderful, but the dancing...I just can't take this big guy with the ponytail as Queen Dido. I don't mind gender-bending per se, but the whole thing looks like a drag queen performance. It's so distracting that I just can't watch it. What a disappointment, cuz it sounds great."
4,Weird yet very beatiful!,"I believe that the production the famous opera Dido and Aeneas is very good, Jeniffer Lane is the best Dido I have ever listened to. The orchestra-Tafelmusik-was great. The only regret I have, (Which really is not regretful) is the dance. The dances, are modern no minuets or any other dance forms. Some of the parts of this opera is not really appropriate for children especially the las two acts. The reason why I say this, is because the dances are not what you would call very Operatice, but all in all, the opera is great. Also, I am confused why the opera has Mark Morris as the Sorceress and Dido."
5,Magnificent collection for the Alan Parsons Project fan,"This fan inspired collection of all the best music composed and produces by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson is simply spectacular. The re mastered quality of the CD is stunning. You can hear all the instruments all the voices in the background and it all comes in crystal clear. The new song ""no answers, only questions"" is a great addition that matches the best of the best of the already released material. The only downer, to me is the new version of ""Separate Lives"" which seems to be melded with the ""Love Boat"" theme. I guess it would be a hit at a retro 70's party. However; it still is a hoot to listen to. For those who were disappointed with Alan's solo efforts this is a definitive ""Must"" for any music collection ( Note: I really love his solos stuff too). Alan Parsons is and will always be the finder of the ""Valid Path"""
5,Incredible flexibility,"While there may be other great piano samples out there and there definitely are - possibly more interesting than these - what is amazing about the way Propellerhead implemented this is the flexibility and tone shaping possibilities. They including several mic positions for each sample - ALL of which can be raised or lowered which dramatically effects the tone in a very real world studio way. If you have experience recording, you will know what I am talking about. Mic position has a huge effect on sound. I don't know of any other sample library that does that as effectively and intuitively as this one. The pianos overall are nice though most are too shiny and bright for my taste. Pulling back on the close mics helps that. It also obviously is meant for use with Reason and Record which makes it the ""go to"" piano library if you use those programs."
5,Essential Reading for Budding Screenwriters,"As a biography, it is compelling reading. Field lived in interesting times, surrounded by interesting people. Though a minor player in Hollywood, his story provides a perspective on the movie-making process in the second-half of the last century that I haven't seen before.The real value of this book, though, is as an unintentional primer on screenwriting. His process, developed over more than a decade, of identifying what makes a movie work and what doesn't is, in my view, more enlightening than all the ""how to"" books ever written, including his own.With this book, Goldman's ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"", and to a lesser extent his follow-up ""Which Lie Did I Tell"", I think the budding screenwriter has everything he or she needs to start writing."
5,Awesome album,"I love this album. The band is from Victoria, which is where I live (that's cool.) I've heard the song 'seems so far' about a hundred times over the radio, when they were 'the zone's band of the month.' All the songs on this album are excellent. When I first got this album, I could listen to all the songs without skipping any, start to finish.This is definitely an album you don't rock out to, very mellow and 'hypnotic' as critics put it.Great album, and recommended."
2,Not that good,the funniest episode was the one with Cortney Love. The rest are more like deleted scenes that where put together into episodes. Some parts funny some not at all.
4,Good Source Book on Random Walk Maths - Easy Read,"I bought this book in 1995 to get an understanding of random walk phenomena.The random walk equations are mostly biologically based.That is equations that describe the motion of biological things.Type of things covered ( including but not limited to)Ficks equationsDiffusionDriftdragDiffusion at EquilibriumDerivation of Boltzman equationImportance of KTMean Square VelocityEinstien-Scmoluchowski relationFlagellar propulsionMotility of Escherichia ColiProbability Distributions (Gaussian , Binomial , Poisson)etcThe book is a fairly easy read.You'll need at least high school to uni maths background.The maths is fairly practical stuff ( translatable to s/w code )There are plenty of graphs and diagrams."
3,Too expensive,"This book intertwines the physics and the mathematics of basic diffusion phenomena within a biology setting in a very well balanced manner. As such, it may appeal to the biology/biochemistry/biophysics student interested in the role of diffusion phenomena in biology, including chemotaxis and bacterial motility. No doubt this little book has its value. Howard Berg is an authority in the subject, a member of learned societies, and teaches at Harvard.However, I found the book a little meagre for its price. You can find similar material intended for the same audience for free on the internet. Moreover---perhaps due to its age, most probably deliberately---, the text does not discuss the role of stochasticity in biology in general, an important topic in modern molecular and cell biology. Definitely does not worth the dollars. I read an exemplar from the local library---with much profit---, but would buy it only if its price were half the current price tag ($32), at maximum."
4,A New York Primer,"Mr. Homberger's book, as the subtitle explains, is a VISUAL celebration. And on that level, the book is highly successful. In other words, don't expect any in-depth, thorough analysis of 400 years of NYC history. (For that, read Burrows and Wallace's GOTHAM.) To me, the sections dealing with pre-Revolutionary War New York are the most valuable, and Ms. Hudson's artwork is at its best there. This book is a great introduction to NYC history. I've lent my copy to several people over the years, and I return to it, again and again. Read, learn and enjoy.Rocco DormarunnoAuthor of The Five Points"
4,The Appetizer,"This was my ""elementary course"" in the history of New York City, my favourite city in the world (well, actually, that was Manhattan). But a lovely, extremely readable, well-written and informative book with incredibly detailed and creatively laid-out maps. With this basic knowledge of the history of NYC intact, I'm moving on to my next goal -- Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 by Burrows and Wallace. Don't we all love New York?"
2,Nice Pictures,"As another review said, this book has some very nice period pictures but I think calling it an ""atlas"" is a real stretch. I found it to be poorly written and poorly organized. It strikes me as a book with chapters written by a variety of authors pulled together and glued into a book but without an editor to review the content. For example, from my experience, a good historical will explain the origin of an interesting item the first time it is used. Not so here and I found myself running to the computer every so often to see why ""Canal Street"" was named Canal Street or to see what happened to the Collect Pond. It more or less flows in time from chapter to chapter but you would never call it seamless and I found myself going back to see if I had missed a chapter while reading. As always, you are bound to learn something by reading this book, even if it is mostly how to detect poor grammar."
3,Disappointed in seller switch,"American Childhood's Best Books Ages 4 and Up to 8The seller advertised the above, but sent the American Childhood's Best Books Ages 8 and up to 12.I was disappointed as I have my childhood book and it is missing a few damaged pages which I had hoped to replace.The condition was as expected, no complaints there."
4,"""Danny Danzi"" learn the name folks, the invasion has begun!!","Good news for rock n' roll fans tired of the same old stuff over and over again, Danny's debut album totally impressed me - one of the most brutally honest people on the planet. As was pointed out by others, Danny deserves a ""hell yeah"" just for his sheer dedication in doing so much by himself (people do you know how hard that is to do?). Danny plays from his heart and soul - his music is truly his life, and it comes through on this rockin' hit. Don't let the 4 star rating I give fool you - that's only because I'm a hard SOB to please and I know Danny will take the big ""5 stars"" with his next CD! BUY THIS CD!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED TRUST ME PEOPLE!!!! Best part about Danny's music? It makes you feel good! The fun is back in rock n' roll! The Danny Danzi invasion has begun!!! ;)"
5,Danny Danzi has arrived!!!!!!!!,"I have to agree with every other review that is on here about this incredible cd. This guy rocks, the cd rocks. Not only did Danny do 97% of the cd himself, but he did it extremely well. He put his heart and soul into everything; the music, the lyrics, the production. Don't just listen to the drum beat or the guitar ""hooks"" or the keyboards, get those liner notes out and read the lyrics. Let them ""sink"" in. You won't be sorry, tells you a great deal about the man and his music. If you haven't gotten this cd yet, GET IT NOW!!! I know I'll be listening to it for a long time. You will too."
4,Overall Good Quality,"I bought this for my brother because he would always forget to take his batteries out to charge and put them on the ""just battery"" charger. Now we aren't always looking for AA batteries since he forgot to charge his rechargeables.PROS: Durable, has wireless mic charger, works perfect with xbox OEM rechargeable batteries, and keeps the area clean in front of the tv now that there is a place to put the controllers.CONS: haven't found any yet."
4,Very good.,"It's a very nice and unique product, fits the XBox 360 controller well. The only downside is that it does not bring batteries of it's own. Which is something that you would not expect with this setup. It really is only useful if you already have a pre-existing battery charger that you would like to have changed to something smoother and cleaner than just wires. Plus the wireless headset charger is a plus. If I would have known it did not include the batteries I would have gone with another product of equal cost that did include them. I ended up spending another $20 in just rechargable batteries."
3,"Works good, but fragile","This charger works good (worked good), but it fell off a desk onto the carpet, and now only the top charger works. The bottom one does nothing.Still semi-useful, but a pain, when you have 2 controllers.Be VERY careful with it, and I suppose it will work fine.EDIT/Update: I posted a ticket on PDP's website, and they just called and said just mail it back and they will replace it. That seems like good customer service to me! +1 star! Now if I actually get the replacement... :)"
5,I just absolutely love this.,"My wife got this in a sample from a ""goodie bag"" and man, it does everything for me. She will spray it on in the morning and even by evening she's still smelling beautiful. I don't know what is in it that makes my heart beat faster it's just great."
5,Great Perfume,"No words!!!!!!!!!!! i just love it, I get so many compliments. Just one thing, the cap of my bottle has some issue. Splash of perfume comes out every time i take the cap off."
1,Not for me,"This smells like ""old lady"" perfume! If you like that then you will love it, but not for me. I gave it to my neighbor and she loves it! However she is not an ""old lady"" but likes that type of perfume."
3,wow Chuao,it's not clear from the item description how many bars/total weight are in this package. I've tasted other Chuao chocolate and they were fabulous!
4,Classically Royal,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
5,A classic treatise,"What can I say? This is a classic. It is the ""treatise for dictators and tyrants"". I gave it a 5 because not only is it a classic, but it helps one to better delve into human nature. Machiavelli was quite prescient in his understanding of human nature for his time. This is a short treatise and it should be on anyone's ""must read""."
3,"A compilation is great, but missing some rare gems","If you're mildly interested in The Dream Academy, view this CD as a ""greatest hits"" -- and not a reworking of the Dream Academy's music. If you like their music, start off with their debut self-titled album that is out of print in the US but can still be found in Europe and Asia.I was disappointed in the song selection (as well as the order of tracks) because there are some B-side rarities, originally on the single 45s released in the mid- to late-80s, that are missing on this compilation. The best of these rare tracks, missing from the CD, is ""Immaculate Heartache,"" (never released on any album) that I would have loved to have seen finally mastered onto CD.These other rare gems include ""Test Tape #3,"" ""Heaven,"" and ""Girl in a Million (for Edie Sedgwick)"".On a positive note, the extended version of ""Life in a Northern Town"" is an amazing mix that in my opinion, surpasses the radio (shorter) version of the original."
3,Is it worth it?,"I go this CD to get the Smiths cover basically (Please, please, please let me get what i want). If you have the other albums on CD, don't bother unless you really really want this song. It is the museum song from ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" but with the lyrics. I'd have rather had the dub version, it was better. But I do like Dream Academy. If you have nothing else on disc of them, get the debut instead. It's the best."
1,$199!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Are you kidding me? You can buy all three of their studio albums (their complete musical output) used for a grand total of around $20. Anyone who pays more than $25 for this album is a complete and utter fool.
5,"Pricey, but worth it","EDIT (08/16/2012): Copies are now in the $90 range so I can no longer say they are worth paying that much. Better to get the various tracks digitally at that price.Even used, this album is going for over $20. Granted, it is an import, but it should still tell you something about the recording.Somewhere in the Sun is a good overview of the combined output of The Dream Academy, and the only place I've seen the extra tracks they did for the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Sure, there are quibbles over the song choices...I'd love to have seen The Edge of Forever on this compilation, but all in all they did a good job. I only wish DA had stuck around a while longer and put out more well written dreamy pop. They were a highlight of the 80's ""New Wave"" scene and their music still holds up well."
1,Black dye of the backpack rubs off!,"I have been looking for a nice diaper bag for almost 2 years and thought I found one that would work for me. I have twins and I need a backpack so I've got two free hands for my boys. Anyway, I pulled this backpack out of the box and my hands were covered in the black dye from the backpack. I thought maybe I could just wipe the rest of it off, but there seems to be an endless supply of black dye. I don't dare use it because I fear that my clothes will also pick up the black dye. Other than that, it seems like a nice bag. If they redesign the bag and fix the dye problem, I would like it better if it didn't have the big ""McKenzie Kids"" label on the front and side. I like the overall look of it because it doesn't look like a backpack I would wear when I'm hiking or going to school. Also, it said that it comes with a diaper changing pad, but it doesn't."
3,Nothing special,I searched and searched for a diaper bag with a removable purse option. THis one was GREAT. Until I lost the purse strap. Good luck finding a replacement without reordering the whole thing!
1,Terrible waste of paper,"Most of the book is illegible, images overexposed to be completely useless. A complete waste of paper. Doesn't Nabu Press ever check the quality of its reproductions?"
3,The Halloween Machine,Sibrena the Teenage Witch Haunts in the House is about a girl who has to try to think of a fund-raiser her school hasn't done all ready. They need money to save all the extra activites. Sibrena and her enemy Libby work together to save the school. Will this work out OK for her? If you would like to know what happens and how it all workes out read this book.This is a good book for people who like magic and think growing up is hard.
1,DO NOT BUY,this case was incredible for the first 2 weeks i had it. it soon started to deteriorate without droppign ocne or anything. terrible quality. starts off great but soon bombs.
1,Duke Basketball Series: Team Defense DVD,"The DVD, though in a packaged case, does not play on my DVD player. This isn't a problem with other DVD's that I have purchased through Amazon, so I am definitely disappointed with the product. Thumbs down."
3,"Buy it, it is very nice but....","I love the concept of this item. I gave half to my daughter and she put it on a chain and it was so nice. The only thing I don't like is that I wish it were a little bigger or thicker, i.e. more substantial. I understand that the cost is less if it is thinner, but I would rather pay a little more for it to be a little bigger or thicker, since this is so beautiful and will last a long time. I would definitely recommend it in any case."
3,Mixed mixes,"Always nice to hear great classics in new formats, but the results here are mixed. A few of these mixes have masterfully managed to keep the qualities of the original while really also adding something new and exciting (The Scumfrog's mix of ""Loving the Alien"", Solaris' ""Shout"" which is a mix of ""Fashion"", and the fantastic Club Bolly Mix of ""Let's Dance""). Others are truly dull and does not work at all outside a club setting. Without these dull tracks which should have remained rare and unreleased this would clearly have been a 5 star album. There are some very good Bowie-mixes out there that would have deserved their place here (such as the homeofmusic mix of ""Let's Dance"" and the Deepskys Space Cowboy Vocal Remix version of ""I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship""). Still, the good stuff is really good and enough to make this a great buy!"
3,A Mixed Bag.,Not everyone will like every mix of some of their favorite songs. There are a few good versions here. The choice is yours.
1,largely forgetable,"well I'm with J Brady on this one. I guess Club Bowie is a hangover from the 80's when Bowie would release just about anything to make a buck. Most of the tracks on this album are just awful. Mind-numbing repetitive trash. Reminds me of the days when I bought the extended mix of Day in Day Out! And I wouldn't do that again in a hurry. In saying that though, there are one or two good remixes here; Scumfrogs' Loving The Alien and Solaris ""Shout."" The rest are fairly lame."
1,"It ends at track 1, beat 1",I remixed Loving the Alien using only the crappy parts of the song. Who needs an incredible chorus when you can listen to the sounds of my utterly forgettable rear end instead?
3,not sure about this toy yet,"my son got this toy for christmas. we got him alot of the Symphony toy from fisher price. he loves music, but so far this toy doesn't seem to hold any Interest for him. maby when he will move the beads but right now all he does with this toy Is throw it to get it to play the music."
1,SKIP THIS ONE!!,"This toy is inexpensive, but surely not worth the few dollars you may pay for it.My daughter has no interest in it, at all. She's 11 months old, and has had this since she was born, and has yet to give it more than a minutes notice."
1,Uh oh..Granny..bop!,"Bought this for my grandson at 10 mo. and he showed very little interest. When I would show it to him, he would want to pick it up,but by the weight and shape of it, it would swing around and bop him in the head or face! Thought it would be fun for him in his carseat, but really too big for that, yet not large enough to capture his attention if it was on the floor with his other toys."
4,loud and flashy,"Even on quiet, this is a rather loud toy. My kids seemed to lose interest in it after a bit. There's not a lot of manipulation that can be done, and the music and lights are a bit overwhelming, sort of squelching their desire to do anything to it on their own."
2,OUCH MY EARS!!,"This toy is sooooo loud I couldn't stand it! The slightest thing would trigger it, even not being touched. My son never wanted to move the beads along, just to bang it on the table and be very noisey. Very good idea, just poorly thought out because of the sound level."
2,Not a very fun toy,"My son got this toy for christmas when he was 4 months old. He wasn't really able to play with it until he was 6 months old. He'll play with it for a very short time. It doesn't hold his attention for more then a minute. He has more fun with many other fisher price toys that he has. I think that if it had more color to it, like one side being different then the other and not exactly the same, it would be more interesting."
3,neat toy,"I puchased this toy for my son when he was 3 months old. Too young to actually hold it and play with it, but if I hold it up in his eye range he loves to look at the lights and he loves the music. The only bad thing I found was that whan I shook it, my son nearly jumped out of his skin it scared him so bad. I then found that you don't need to shake it to make it play, you just need to tap it on its side. He liked that better. When he is old enough to play with it himself, I think he will love it."
1,Little fingers get stuck in the stars!,"I bought this toy when my daughter was only 8 months old. I liked the fact that it was one of the few toys that a baby could activate without pushing a button or something equally hard for a small baby to do. Well, she ignored it for the most part, but I'm not going to blame the toy on that - she doesn't seem to play with any of her toys (is more interested in whatever she lies finding around the house). She is now 11 months and last night she actually played with it. Then, she started screaming. I ran over and saw that two of her little fingers got wedged in the star opening (between the plastic star and the bar that the star slides on). I quickly got them out, but basically had to pull the star off her fingers and she screamed some more. Luckily, it didn't leave any mark and a few seconds of comforting and she was okay. But I couldn't believe it! I won't let her play with it again!"
4,A great hit!,"We bought this for our daughter 3 months ago but I bet that she would have liked it earlier! (We got it for her when she was 6 mo). It was an instant hit. Most of her other toys got boring to her after only 1 or 2 months and had to be put away for awhile. Not this one though! This one she has played with every day for 3 months and it still fascinates.The songs are fun, though I wish more of the songs they chose had words so we could sing along with her. But they did think of adjustable volume level, so that was great!"
2,Could have been better...,"But not the worst book ever!As a former interior designer, I still have a fondness for books about decorating and design. But this book will not be a keeper on my shelf.Nicely packaged as to be expected of the Chic line. But so sterile, bare, boring--who says stylish has to be so basic?In their wonder bread world, the Chic people forgot that the chicest looks of all revolve around creativty, texture, color--take a risk! Unless you live in a loft somewhere, there is nothing homey or comfortable about this house. It is like a museum--look but don't touch. Just fill your eyes with more visual candy and run, don't walk to grab the latest issue of House Beautiful, Better Homes and Gardens or Architectural Digest. They are sure to be more idea-inspiring."
5,My favorite scent,"I have purchases this fragrance several times over the past decade and I always get compliments on the fragrance. I will continue to purchase this fragrance. The smell is light, sweet but not too sweet. It's not spicy, but it works year round. It's not too heavy for the office. It's perfect for dates b/c it's not aggressive but there is enough aroma to make a presence."
2,Hard to find but Fake perfume :((,"I've purchased this perfume from department stores many times.But this one is not like that and it doesn't last long it stay like an hour or so,It doesn't smell exactly like the one from stores.Which makes me think it could be fake."
5,Perfect Parfum,The service was nice. I got my item on time. And the choice I made was Perfect. I recommend this parfum.
4,Great new music that's a little on the strange side.,"I've always been a fan of Faith No More since Patton joined and had never listened to Mr. Bungle. This time around, I bought their album (based upon all of the other positive reviews) and I love it! There are a couple of songs that aren't as good as the rest, but overall it's a very dynamic and ecclectic CD. Dunno if they meant to do it, but ""California"" has a HUGE influence from Todd Rundgren's 1985 release, ""A Cappella"". If you don't own it, I highly recommend it."
1,This makes my ears hurt,"I barely had the patience to listen to this entire album. I still don't know what kind of music Mr. Bungle wants to play. They do everything, and they do it AWFUL!! You have slow pop ballads, high-flying swing, heavy metal, techno, and even lullabies!! It's just strange music, and the horribly placed tempo changes drive you nuts. I guess some people like the different styles of music, but all put together; it's just a big scrambled mess."
5,This Album Is Genious,"I learned about this band when ripping on The Locust, whom I feel are completely untalented. Someone recommended this band and I have never been more pleased in my life. This album consists of the most calming, unique songs I've ever heard. I like lots of unique stuff like Frank Zappa and Mindless Self Indulgence, but this is something gold. When people say nobody has ever really pioneered this genre, I'm fine with agreeing with it. The only way one could possibly describe this album would be to say The Beach Boys in Space. I can die happy knowing I've listened to this band."
5,the end of the world?,"i bought this album the first day it came out and listened to it for almost 2 or 3 weeks straight and then i hadn't listened to it again til just this week. i love it, still! the best thing about it is when you're driving around in the middle of the night and listening to it, i don't know if it's just me, but it feels like you're driving to the edge of the world and it's only time before you fall off. mike patton is definitely the most creative, intellectual, and versatile vocalist/musician out there and certainly the most underrated. anyways, if u haven't bought this one yet, buy it! oh yeah, don't listen to it if you have a headache, though."
5,One of times greatest albums,"You Don't release an album like this and then just break up. I guess its kind of like the perfect ending to a screwed up movie. This album is so fantastic it cant be put into words. Mr Bungle play what some might class as ""cheesie"" music BUT manage to not sound cheesie at all. If you are a fan of music then you must own this album."
4,Califormia,"'California' must surely be the first Bungle album to be a truly rewarding experience. Tracks such as 'Pink Cigarette' and 'Sweet Charity' will be exceptionally favourable to the easy listening FNM fans, whilst the magnificent 'None of them knew..' and 'Goodbye Sober Day' experiment whilst maintaining a strong degree of accessibility. Basically, pretty damn good!"
2,VINYL reissue,"A brilliant album, of course. But like the notorious vinyl reissue of the first Bungle album, this is not a good purchase. The mastering is extremely quiet; I found I had to turn the volume to nearly twice the level that my turntable normally requires, and because of that, the sound distorts. Some might say that this is necessary because of the way the album was recorded (multi-tracked, full-frequency, etc), but I don't think this is the case. It's a shame, because this album was clearly destined for vinyl (ten songs in 45 minutes, the 60s-style cover, etc). Warner Bros. should have done it themselves back in 1999, but oh well."
2,Just not the same Mr. Bungle,"This album is pretty good. However I'd rather stick a fork in my eye. I like the ""old crazy"" Mr. Bungle not the ""I'm trying to make a good album"" Mr. Bungle. I now have all three Mr. Bungles and this one is the worst so far. However I did give it two stars for two reasons. One, It's Mr. Bungle, and two, the last song is really crazy. If your a fan of the self titled album, don't buy this."
4,hmmmm,"the other Mr.Bungle albums sound like the Boredoms trying to play Frank Zappa songs,this one sounds like the Boredoms trying to play The Mavericks and Devo songs.there's nothing really original here but its still very good, some songs are so horribley dumb you'll feel like you want to stomp this cd's plastic guts out. one i'm talking about is the title track, sweet charity, really now. DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE! its an ok album, check it out.and try your best not to think about Devo when you listen to it or it will be ruined."
3,Merely okay.,"While the self-titled Bungle is a nonpareil, California is surprisingly mediocre. It seems Patton has transferred his weirder urges to his band Fantomas, and Bungle has taken on Faith No More's former role as his commercial money-maker. A good CD, to be sure, but not the Bungle we know and love; there are no ten minute jams, no connected songs, and there exists a serious dirth of farting, grunting, and wanton screaming. And they call this Bungle?This is high production, good music, but it's not the caged, frenetic musicality we've come to expect. Buy their first CD and scribble ""California"" on the cover.The last track, however, is amazing, and for that I'm giving it an extra star."
2,The change was for the worse,"I heard this albumn expecting the compositional genius of Disco Volante, but what I got was much, much worse. This was the most pathetic attempt at commercialism I have ever heard. These guys were wacky jazz gods, this pop drivel works only good as a frizbee down at the park. All you guys giving this 5 stars ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Loyalty is not relevant when bands change genre."
2,HEY,"Okay. Some people are just rude. I take offense to calling me a fan of ""MTV Garbage."" I hate MTV and all the stupid teeny-bop shluck they put on there. I was simply being honest about my impression of the music. I reviewed this CD for my college radio station and I'm sure I won't buy the CD. I'm also sure these guys do a great live show, because there music is geared towards a live audience, I think."
1,What happened to them?,"What the heck happened to them. Did the guitarist die? Did they forget how to rock? Does anyone rock anymore? Between this and the new Chili Peppers Ballad fest, I am about to give up on music."
3,Not enough continuity here,"After my history and english teacher recommended Mr. Bungle, I went out and bought this album. Little did I know how wacky it would become. I usually chill or putter while listening to music. Mr. Bungle doesn't allow for that. This CD is EXTREMELY difficult to listen to, because every thirty seconds, you're listening to a completely different type of song than you were listening to before. Take ""Goodbye Sober Day,"" for example. It goes from swing to latin to noise to some weird monk chant to death metal back to swing in only four and a half minutes. That's way too much change in a song for me to be able to relax listening to it. I'm sorry, but this album is way too confusing.I will give Mr. Bungle credit for one thing: they have broad influences. Maybe, they need to learn how to work with those influences."
4,"Very good, their most accessible yet","I never thought these guys could/would write something like Retrovertigo. What, a ballad in an almost conventional form? Yet, this is a very good song, it grows up on you, like the rest of this excellent album. I love the first 2 albums, but I find this one to be less anoying, the most accessible of the 3. An impressive effort!"
5,Sweet,"Definitely Mr. Bungle's most accessible album, but still a hefty chunk of good ol' Bungle craziness. Very catchy."
5,"not a review, just a correction.","om my review i meant to write Retrovertigo, not retrovision. Sorry for the mistake amazon.com."
5,My second review for this album,Once again i felt that i needed to review this album. Because after a few days of listening to it your opinion changes a bit. Well i heard it none stop fo0r the past 3 days and it has only gotten better. Another piece of genius from Bungle what they do on this album is truly amazing. This CD is just a must buy for any person who really believes that creative music is still alive.
5,Best album I own - Buy it or miss out,"If you are already a Mr Bungle fan, you will own this album and think it's incredible. But if there are any non fans out there, take these words seriously: BUY THIS ALBUM. Put away your concept of cool, detach from your Mtv warped mind. This is what real music is like. Bungle will take you places you never imagined. California is without question the finest masterpiece from this group of twisted geniuses. Let me put it another way. If you were starving and only had 15 bucks to your name, you could buy food or this album... well, you'd have a great time with California until you died. It's just that good."
5,Wholly Awesome,"Off the wall and unique. I am believer in Mr. Bungle and Faith No More, my son got me hooked on them."
5,Artwork!!,"Wow! Thats about the best I can put it. This is the first Mr. Bungle album I bought and it was a hell of an adventure from the beginning to end. It takes a special group to be able to take different styles of music from the whole spectrum and make it flow like that. My favorite song is probably the last one. From the Arabic vocal patterns to the Heavy Metal thrash, it was a blast to listen to. Anybody who's looking for a blend of music with no limits, Mr. Bungle is the way to go. Like many other reviewers have mentioned before, this one is the most accessible CD they put out, and I mean that in the most relative sense."
5,1 star ratings are laughable,"Anyone who gives this album a low rating obviously doesn't know what their talking about and probably just had an ulcer. Mr. bungle rulz no matter what they do. I don't know about those 1- star people, but I choose to stick with the best."
5,very origional...still!,"this cd is the ""emaculate conception"", of the singer. the man is a crazed lunatic with a massive vision. the front man for several groups still keeps it real with this one!!!! 5 stars all the way!!!!"
3,IN BETWEEN OF THE 1ST DEBUT AND CACA VOLANTE,"i'd like to say that california is the most melodious album of mr bungle's three albums catalogue.listen to vanity fair,retrovertigo,and you'll know what i'm saying.for those who digs the deadly disastrous sound of mr.bungle's caca volante,this album could be a dissapointment to you,but if you dig the eclecticism,diversity and the genius arrangements of their debut,you'd probably dig this one better.but i,personally,still rate their debut as the best work.well..maybe mike patton has found his other vessel for his genius,destructive,disastrous musical vision in FANTOMAS."
3,"NOT a ""quick and dirty"" CGI reference...","You must be careful when usign this book. I found myself wasting a lot of time typing (oreilly's ftp site was down, and has been down lately--what can I say?) and implementing the examples in the book only to get to the end of the chapters to find out that the authors were holding out on me for a better solution. For example: Parsing forms? Don't implement anything on Chapter 4, ""Decoding Form Input."" Wait until the next chapter about CGI.pm. Searching the web server (Chapter 12)? Wait until the end of the chapter before implementing anything, or waste alot of time.Don't get me wrong, this book has some decent information in it. And there is much learning to be done in reviewing how NOT to do certain things. However, I'm not sure how many people read CGI books from cover to cover.Bottom line: the authors should have been more mindful of their audience's time constraints and should have tailored the exposition of material accordingly."
3,I've Seen Better,"The author states up front that you should know the perl language. If you know perl, you might enjoy this book. If you don't know perl, don't buy this book.I found the orginization of the book to be clunky. The book didn't flow well from topic to topic. Having a basic knowledge of CGI, I was able to wade my way through it and understand what the author was trying to convey. If I was a beginner, I would have a hard time grasping the concepts.In short, buy this book if you are already familiar with perl and CGI programming. If you are a beginner with CGI programming, look for another book."
3,disappointing - well below the quality O'Reilly is known for,"The first problem is that the book is obviously misnamed.There are several chapters that deal with non-CGIWeb programming issues, such as JavaScript and email.There are numerous typos, distortions, omissions, andmisstatements of fact througout the book. I have seenmany of them listed on the offical errata page O'Reillymaintains for the book, but have noticed several thataren't listed yet. Three authors for one book in thiscase clearly resulted in too many cooks spoiling the broth."
2,"No new information, not complete","This book pales in comparison to Learning Perl and Programming Perl, which are both essential books to read before you can even attempt to understand the examples in CGI Programming.The essential information contained can easily be discovered on countless internet tutorials, and with more depth. CGI Programming only skims over each topic, never going in to much depth, and the topics that it covers are much too varied and vast.I own this book but rarely use it. By the time you have read Learning Perl and/or Programming Perl, you will find CGI Programming obsolete."
2,Be ready to do extra research...,"There seems to be some good content, but I'm shocked at the number of errors in the code examples. They probably should have had an extra round of editing before they published. Check the errata page at the O'Reilly web site."
2,Write an outline before you start writing a book,"Fairly good content, but hideously organized. The book jumps all over the place and really lacks the coherence I've come to expect from O'Reilly books. I used ""Learning Perl"" to get pretty good with Perl in two weeks. The book on HTML is terrific as well. A good ""Learning CGI"" book to lead into this one would be nice I think."
2,Pick a better book,"As I'm not an experienced programmer, I did find this book very difficult to understand. The authors assume you have an in-depth knowledge of PERL and the workings of CGI.The book does offer some good knowledge in real-life examples for Webmasters. It discusses forms and how the information is passed with certain HTML commands. However, if you want to learn about CGI, choose another. As for Perl, I've found Larry Wall's books very good."
1,"Should be called ""Using perl modules for CGI""","Sad to say this book is far from on par with O'Reilly's usually high standards. It's more of a nutshell book, touching upon this and that and not explaining the underlying necessary knowledge one must know to write cgi's.My biggest complaint actually is that the authors spend most of the book talking about how to do things with the perl modules such as Carp and CGI.pm, so much so that they don't bother to tell you how to actually write the cgi's yourself without depending on these additional and usually unnecessary modules.I for one don't see how print $q->header( ""text/html"" ); is an improvement considering how perl is so natural language without all this garbage, and would like to learn how to program perl cgi prior to learning modules."
2,Dont know Perl dont buy this book,I bought this book because i wanted to proccess Credit Cards on my website through CGI Scripting but when i got it i was dissapointed because it requires you to know Perl Language.It kind of helped me a little but if u are interested in CGI Programming and dont know Pearl do not buy this book but if you do i think it will help you.
3,Had to watch it for school,"Eh, wasn't my cup of tea. I've never understood why some films get to be recognized as ""masterpieces"" when to me they aren't particularly impressive."
5,Bunuel Classic,This is one of my favorite Bunuel films and not currently available on Netflix. Fast service at a fair price.
2,Something doesn't smell right...,"The Joy perfume I got was tightly sealed as promised but it didn't smell fresh. I tried it for about 2 weeks and finally threw it away. True I hadn't had to pay the $100+ price I would have had to pay if I had bought it in a store, but I was very unhappy with the Joy I got. I will now order from my usual reliable department store online.I will have to pay the exorbitant price, but my nose knows!"
3,"Honestly, Why Bother?","All in all, this is a pleasant enough compilation. There are no embarassing moments. The performers all acquit themselves nicely. But in the long run, there's really little to recommend this above the rest of the many tributes and reviews recorded of Sondheim's music. No new interpretations. No amazing performances. No inspired song choices. Nothing special here, folks."
1,defective,I bought this for my 3 yr old son for xmas and was very disappointed. The wooden connector piece that came with it did not fit at all. it wasnt cut right and he was very upset.
5,Absolutely MUST READ for EVERY PERSON in first world!! MUST!,"This is my #1 book recommendation! Mind-blowing! Expose on the corrupt, IMF/WorldBank/Ex-Im/multinational corporation/defence industry led ABUSE of environment and indiginous peoples world-wide. A MUST! for every single person in US and Europe, First World."
5,Works as advertised.,"I just received this and went to plug it into my phone, only to find out that it's the wrong type of USB port for my phone. Fiddlesticks. What I really need for my Droid Pro is the USB micro charger. Anyways, I am able to use this to charge some other portable electronics so it's not a total loss. It's entirely my fault for not doing my homework."
3,Reads Like a Rough-Draft of 'Wurm',"Another reviewer has summarized the plot nicely, so I won't delve into that too much. My gripe with this novel is twofold:1) As another person mentioned, the cover art is truly misrepresentational - the art director that OK'd it was fired, I hope.2) This book reads like a rough-draft for Costello's later (and in my opinion, far superior) novel 'Wurm'. Now there's nothing wrong, I guess, with writing two variations on the same idea, but having read Wurm first and then Midsummer, I was disappointed by the latter.I will say that the late explanation of the 'infection' was handled in a truly unique, offbeat, and creepy manner, saving this book from a two-star rating. Give 'Wurm' a read if you want a much better version."
3,"excellent, but beware","As a mother of a young adult son with OCD and Tourette I was amazed at how accurate this very poignant and powerful movie was, and was actually moved to tears. However it is a very powerful movie and I would not want my afflicted son nor his girlfriend to watch it. It is a great movie to recommend to those people that don't believe OCD and/or Tourette are a real illness."
3,okay movie,"Kind of disturbing. The movie itself is okay if you are not personally affected by somebody with TS. For me it was too personal as I have a child with TS and it seems ""gloom and doom"" If you do get it and you have a teen with TS, I wouldn't let them watch it."
4,Don't pass this one up,"Okay, so maybe it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definetly worth looking into. It's probably not like anything you've seen before, and so much better than all those big name new releases that get so hyped up, but end up sucking (which is most of them). The acting was superb, as well as the story and the way they filmed it. It definetly caught me off guard a few times, never knowing what the characters were going to say (...""Bleep!"")or do. It was a funny yet sad movie that had a real beauty to it,and depth to the characters...maybe you know someone just like them....or maybe it will remind you in some ways of yourself...making you realize you're not so flawed, you're just like the rest of us."
4,Simply... well... amazing!,"In general, I am not a fan of rap music. There are many songs, however, that I do like. Beside that point, Rahzel's CD just blew me away. At first, I found it hard to believe that a human could do what Rahzel does, but it's real, and I respect him for that. It's really great stuff."
3,Do you understand what I am saying?,"Yep, he is a talented guy and the hidden track is probably the best thing on here. There are some really good tracks at the beginning and 'Southern Girl' works well, but the rest is all filler ... and some pretty lame and predictable filler too. Cheez whizz. Do you get me?"
3,Not what you'll expect,"The first single All I Know was pretty phat. I thought this was going to be a good Hip-Hop album but when I listened to the album it wasn't what I expected. Rahzel bearly sings and a lot of wak singers are on the CD. But there are some good songs on the CD like the song Q-tip is in, the song Slick Rick is in, and also the hidden track."
3,he's a better beatbox than rapper,"i love rahzel, i love the roots, but rahzel's lyrics pale in comparison to blackthought's. i enjoyed his beatbox skills more than his rhymes"
4,There's only one thing lacking,"I just saw Rahzel perform two nights ago in Cleveland, and then went out and bought the album. As unbelievable Rahzel is on the CD, his act is twice as fantastic live. And I can safely say that since recording the live tracks and interludes from MTM:2000, Rahzel has gotten better. He performed ""If Your Mother Only Knew"" and ""Wu Tang"", and the album simply can not touch the live performance. Don't let that stop you from buying the CD however, it is still the single most amazing piece of beatboxing ever laid on wax/silicon."
3,"A good album, not great","Rahzel is certainly a talented individual. But this record only hints at the stuff he is capable of. The traditional rap songs aren't particularly unique or interesting, and there is far too little of Rahzel's incredible noize-making abilities. Why is this? I don't know, but it would have made for a better album overall. I think you will listen to this a few times and then put it away, which is too bad considering Rahzel's talents."
3,rahzel is superhuman,"First things first, you cant front on the fact that this man is mad nice with his. He's on a whole other plataeu than most hiphop heads. His gift is nothing short of incredible,superhuman even. You are honestly constantly questioning whether the stuff he does is ""actually possible"", making beats sound better then any dat machine while similtaneosly providing basslines. But i do have only 1 complaint. Its not really a full album,and if like me you had to pay an import price for it you will feel slightly cheated and not just a little pissed. There's 9 full tracks with Rahzel only rapping on 7 of them, the other 2 he provides the beats(which the 2 guests stars dont really utilise properly in my opinion). All in all its a really tight cd and if you can pick it up on the cheap you'll enjoy it a whole lot more."
4,Amazing,"I couldnt believe it before i heard it by myself Rahzel is greatest beat machine in the whole wide world. If you like rap music, you'll have to buy this. I mostly like Gangstarr, but now a days Rahzels album belongs to one of my favorites records. Listen to it by yourself if you dont believe me!"
5,Rahzel Tha human beatboxed out pimp!,"Rahzel combines mad flows wit bombed out sound effects that he does. You can compare himto micheal winslow from police academy but strictly rap, All I know is great!"
2,There will be better ones...,"The T series...are ok, but I returned them because they weren't much better than the included one that comes with the t415 and t615. It didn't seem worth the price to me...I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Try to make do with the original stylus until better ones are out: that's what I'm planning to do. The only reason I could see purchasing this is if you lose your original T-series Clie stylus."
3,They're ok,"Buy them just if you need them... I bought them because I lost the one that came with the Clié and since it brings 3 of them... you actually don't need them all.The colors are not the best thing, I preffered the silver one that came with the Clié, now I use the black one and have the other 2 at home."
3,Wish you could pick your colors and one was loose,"A stylus is a stylus, but it would be nice if you could pick the colors you get. I think they have a silver/white, black/black, and black/blue or something; you either get one of each or a random set, not clear to me. Personally, I have one color I prefer, and wish I could just get 3 of those.Also, one of these was looser than the others, and it kept flying out of my Clie when I opened it. I'm sure there's some odd trick to fixing this, but I haven't bothered to look it up."
3,"On-again, off-again Roches","This is a return to their earlier sound, after some splitting-apart, etc. And on a few songs it works. But their abilities as song writers have never been as strong as their harmonies as sisters, and when they get cute, man, do they get CUTE. So if you like the Roches, you'll want this, but if you're curious about who they are, I'd start with one of their earlier ones."
4,So glad they're back!,All of the wonderful quirky lyrics and harmonies of the sisterly variety! And I haven't heard the Naughty Lady of Shady Lane in a lifetime! Can't stop listening to it!
4,roches moonswept,The voices of these three ladies fit perfect.AND THEY DO HAVE A NICE SENSE OF HUMOR...buy it ! and don't forget there first and third record.
5,The Roches are back!,"This is an amazing effort from the Roches. Highlights include Jesus Shaves (not jesus saves as listed on the amazon track list) and No Shoes. This is intelligent, heartfelt music performed with technical virtuosity and love."
5,Fantastic!,The CD just arrived today and I've already listened to it twice. I have been a fan since 1984 and this album may be my favorite yet. I'm so thrilled to have all three sisters singing together again.
3,Clearest mathematical introduction,"This introduction for undergrads assumes no specifics other than general experience in college math. The writing is clear and exercises are interspersed and follow naturally from the explanations. Proofs are explanatory and easy to follow, though often rather informal.However, it looses some of its best qualities about halfway through the book. The early chapters give excellent context and motivation, but by chapter 4 that is mostly gone. It seems that the push to cover more topics is what led to making the introduction of new topics more and more brief. The later chapters give little feeling for how it all fits together and why we should care. You can look up the same topics in Rogers or Odifreddi to get an idea of the interesting things that could have been said."
5,Lots of curl,"Great hair setter, lots of curl fast, gentle on hair. My first one lasted 17 years. I can curl my hair in a few minutes. Curlers heat in the time it takes to prepare a strand of hair for rolling."
5,Very good for fine hair!!,"Over the years I have had 2 of these. My original Caruso is still useable! It was larger and you had to use salt to make it steam. I used the second one for 10 years before it stopped steaming quickly. This model is very small and steams quickly. It is small enough to pack in a suitcase and comes with an assortment of rollers. If you want body in your hair and cannot use the new irons out there, this is for you! This will never burn or harm your hair. I hope they never quit making these!!!!!"
5,Sister sharing.,I really do like this. i bought it for my sister and i take it all the time. my sister has issues with curling her hair. shes always asking me to do it. but with this she has perfect curls and it isnt as damaging on her already dyed hair. it really does take some time to get used to using this. there are tons of videos on youtube demonstrating how to use this. i learned quickly from Wendyslookbook.Great buy!
2,Curlers,"Ultimate user didn't like it: waaay too many curlers, and you can only heat / steam 1 at a time."
1,No steam at all,Didn't work and none in stock foa an exchange. Used this in the 90's and it was great for my heavy relaxed hair. I will probably order another when the stock comes in.
2,Frizzy Curls,"I bought this because of a fashion blog (Wendy Nguyen). She recommended it and made a video of her using them, making them look super easy and convenient. I didn't find it to be either of those things. First of all, Wendy has super thin hair vs my thick hair. I don't know how much of a factor that is but the curls were frizzy, messy, and unattractive. I've used twice & haven't opened it since. It was 40$ down the drain when curls made by my 15$ curling iron & 15$ hair curlers did a way better job."
5,The only Hairsetter I'll ever have!,"This is my third Caruso Hairsetter. I still have the old add salt unit and it still works. I up graded to a non-salt unit and it worked for years. We moved to an area with much harder water. I should have been using distilled water here, the unit stopped working. This is my third Caruso Hairsetter. The first ion unit I have tried. LOVE it! I have long fine blonde hair. It is easy to curl but hard for a style to last. But with this product I have no problem. Also, to me it take very little time. Start up time is short. In the morning I put my hair in rollers (10), put my make-up on, take out rollers - done in less than 10 minutes."
2,Not the best,"I purchased this set after carefully reading reviews on many steam rollers. I was replacing a 20 year old steam set that had hard plastic rollers and gave me big bouncy curls in an hour. This set sounded great as reviews indicated needing only 15 minutes to set. I have steamed the rollers anywhere from 5-10 seconds and my hair is NEVER dry in 15 minutes. I often have to use a hair dryer to complete the process so I can get to work on time. Also the roller covers leave dents in your hair. I purchased the Conair clips as suggested by other reviewers and they help. Still the curls do not last all day, are somewhat flat and no bounce. Since the rollers are foam you cannot get a big bouncy curl like I was looking for. I would not purchase this again."
4,"Call me when they add a 2"" roller size","4 stars *only* because they don't have 2"" rollers (max is 1.5""). The steam heat works great at smoothing out my thick, slightly curly, medium-length hair, but the jumbo size provides too tight a curl for what I want. I'm not looking for curls - just smooth with some volume. The Caruso steam rollers are brilliant - easy, quick, great results, packable - but I can't understand why they don't make larger size rollers. Round brush for blow drying, curling iron, regular rollers ... all available in 2"" sizes. (Just searched around to see if anyone makes ""super jumbo"" hot rollers, but the biggest I can find is 1.75"", and they're not steam heat. What I did find is a lot of other women complaining that they cannot find 2""+ hot rollers.)"
5,They're great!!!,"I'm so glad I bought them. I followed the instructions and had no problems. The ion setting is noisy, so I just use the steam setting. I've done curls and spirals with beautiful results.My only issue: I received 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium and 12 jumbo rollers (instead of 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large and 6 jumbo rollers). But it's ok. I don't miss the large rollers much."
1,Cheap made,"Received this item today. Excited to open, disappointed to see. First of all, it came in colourcof grey instead of red.Most important is There are several crack markes on unit. I can tell right away that this product is made from very cheap material, plastic and foam. With cracks and obvious low quality material, i dont see it will last. I bought this based on good reviews here, which means i was misled. Will try to return it.Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam HairsetterUpdate, very good customer service though, had a smooth return."
2,Steam hairsetter,"After reading some of the opinions of others, I was truly looking forward to getting the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter. Unfortunately, I found that although it does set in curl, the curls are flat and they don't last."
3,Caruso Professional Ion Steam Hairsetter,"Please bring back the steam hair setter that uses salt!! The new Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter works ""OK"", but not nearly as well as the older models that used to add salt. (Caruso Happy 3-way Traveler) I also prefer the feature that allows you to steam the cover at the same time, with this one you must steam the roller first then the cover. The cover tends to slide when placed on the steamer. I give this item 3 stars because it just doesn't work as well on fine-textured hair like mine."
4,curls do last more than one day,"I love these curlers and this is the second time I've bought them. I, too, had the old model where you added salt. The pink sponge part of that set finally disentigrated. I'm not convinced this model is better but I had to use Jumbo curlers when I need Large. For some reason I got 12 Jumbo curlers and NO Large curlers (should have been 6 of each). I'm going to write the company and see if their customer service is as good as their curlers! I have medium length, fine, whimpy hair, and they make me look like I have a head of hair!"
4,"Fabulous product, but arrived damaged","This is my fifth Caruso hairsetter. I love the appliance. Nothing else give me such lasting volume and waves, so quickly or easily. I have long, very thick hair, and using a curling iron to get the same effect takes over 40 minutes. With the Caruso, I'm set to go in less than 15 minutes, start to finish. Even though the anchoring post for steaming the rollers was broken upon arrival, I kept this shipment, becuase I can't stand to be without this product."
2,Very disappointed.,"With all the hype on healthy hair forums about the caruso steam rollers, I was very excited when it arrived. After my first attempt I had limp curls that did not last longer than 1 hour. On my second attempt I did it on dry hair with very little products added as I though the moisture from my styling products may have made my hair to limp, nope. On dry hair with minimal product had the same limp hair. Needless to say, the caruso set went right back to Amazon for my refund. I have 4A fine relaxed hair, so this product may be great for those who tex-lax or ladies who are natural with thicker hair."
1,I'll never learn!,"This ""supposed"" hair curler is the biggest farce of a product I've ever encountered or wasted money on. After using it your hair still looks like you just crawled out of bed. From the clumsy curler to the way the curler mashes the hair, there is absolutely no way this product can leave you with a head of hair that you would take out in public. The only reason I still have it, is because I got sick and couldn't test it out before the 30 days were up. I just made some rich guy OR girl a little richer - story of my life. Bottom line. Don't waste your money."
1,BUYER BEWARE; ROLLER COUNT IS DECEIVING,"I owned the original back in the '80s and loved it. I just purchased this new model with the promise of 5 different sizes of rollers, 6 each, for a total of 30.It arrived. With 30 rollers. As follows: TWELVE Jumbo/Large (in the ad, they state that Jumbo and Large are two different sizes; they are not. Roller is clearly marked ""Jumbo/Large"". There are 6 each of medium, small and petite.I am furious at having been duped. What's further enraging is that the enclosed roller re-order form actually lists ""jumbo"" and ""large"" with two different SKUs!This is preposterous and deceptive. Amazon should correct it right away."
1,Did not like it at all,Was really looking forward to this hair roller set. It is much harder to use. Takes longer to set. Curls did not last longer. Very disappointed. I'm going right back to my jumbo revlon heated rollers.
3,"I absolutely hate those ""guards""!","I've had this unit for a little over a year but after the first month or so stopped using it as a ""hot"" set because the rollers and guards just locked in the wetness from the steam and I'd have to stand and blow dry my head with the curlers in--which takes forever even with my fine, fairly short hair. I did like the lightness of the foam curlers and found out they worked well, cold and dry, for curling my hair in a couple of hours if I wasn't in any hurry. But, still disliking those solid plastic guards, I used different sizes of those claw clippies to hold the curlers in place and that worked great. So, while I didn't quite get the results I wanted, at least this wasn't a complete waste."
1,They leave my hair wet,I have had a set of Caruso rollers in the past and these are not the same. My other set was great. My hair would stay curled for 2 days. These make your hair damp so no curl will hold.
4,Long-lasting curls,Nice product. Sometimes I can get away with a second day of curls from just one set. Easy to use.
2,Still Breaks the Hair Off From the Steam,I purchased these outside Amazon a couple years back. Wouldn't buy these again. I find that these still dry the hair out and if your hair is very long will break it off. Not sure if there are any heated rollers that won't make the hair brittle. These are no different.
1,Steam Curlers,This product takes too long to use. It only takes a single curler at a time and it sucks.
1,You should know this product takes nearly an hour to set.,People rave about this product. However I followed all the instructions and found it takes 5 minutes for each roller to heat up. That's nearly an hour if you use just 12 of the 30 rollers! Then an additional 15 minutes to let it all dry. The curls did not last even a few hours on my hair.
2,I'd like to return this please,I'd like to return this please it didnt meet my expectations or needs.
4,Caruso steam ...,"As an African-American I was unsure of how the product would work on my hair. I am still a novice with the product, but it seems to be great for curly styles. It is also great if you want to style synthetic hair (various braid styles).I would definitely recommend this product for others."
3,"Great rollers, just not for me","I have a relative who swears by these things for taking the frizz out of her hair, evening out her waves, and giving her shine. I have very porous, frizzy hair, and all this set did was make it frizz more. It didn't even out anything, and it definitely didn't give my hair shine. I gave this set to said relative, who is now a very happy said relative."
5,Just Like I Remembered,"I had a set of the original Caruso steam rollers back in the '90s and lost them during one more or another. I had never seen them again since then since then, but lo and behold, Amazon to the rescue! These new rollers performed exactly as my old ones did, and without having to carry around a plastic baggie of salt everywhere I went. I got these to set my hair for a play I was performing in, so portability, ease of use, and a quick set were all pretty important. I love that they don't take up a lot of room in my bag, though I do wish the travel case included with it were a little sturdier. The handles a rather flimsy and I have a feeling they'll tear long before I'm done with the rollers. Luckily, I'm using the case more for storage rather than actual travel, so maybe it'll hold up okay. I'm still looking for a different case in the meantime, though."
3,not completely satisfied,May need to work with cutlers more. Ends of hair are sometimes frizzy. Haven't given up on it yet. Will continue use.
1,Not for worldwide usage,I bought this product because it said it can be used worldwide. The instructions leaflet says to use 110 voltage only. Now I cannot use it in countries with 220 voltage that I travel to.
3,a hair in there?... uhm... it makes wonderful curls but...,my system has a crack in it and the switch gets stuck. When I turn it on ionic it makes this funny noise. I also found a piece of very crimped hair darkish hair in there.... I'm blonde and I have naturally straight hair so... kinda scary. They give out to many big ones and not enough small ones. Overall I like it but I wish it was a bit more well made.
2,Temperary,"I only used it twice and it wouldn't work anymore... I used drinking water as recommended in other reviews but it has not kept my steamer alive for at least half a year. It was a terrific curler while it lasted. If you find a really cheap one ($5-$10), I suggest buying it..."
3,Loud clicking,"Beware that when turning the unit on the ""Ionic"" setting it does make a loud clicking noise that does not go away unless you turn to ""Steam"" only setting or ""Off"". It is a annoying. As far as the curling abilities, I used it once and the curls were mediocre after leaving the rollers on for 20 minutes."
2,Maybe it's just me but.....,"I tried three times to get this to work (and watched a you tube tutorial) and maybe it's just my hair because everyone else seems to love it, but it wouldn't hold the curl at all...even with product the curls, more like waves really, just fell after a few minutes....resulting in just a mess of hair. My hair is naturally wavy and not especially course, so I wouldn't recommend this, but maybe it's just me....hair is a subjective thing I suppose."
5,Just need practice,"I think they are great hair styling tools.......the curl or body really does hold, just need practice with the roll up."
4,Great steam curlers,"I really like this product because it works! I have rolled my hair at night and slept on curlers for a long time. For various reasons I didn't want to have to do that all the time anymore. Now I can roll my hair in the morning and do my make-up etc and by the time I am ready to brush and style my hair it is set. I really doubted this would work this well but it really does. I get the curl that I want for my hair, the curl lasts and that is exactly what I wanted.The Caruso hairsetter system is great!"
2,Two Stars to Give it a Chance,"I've been using this for three days now. I was a big fan of the original Caruso steam setter that required the addition of salt. It gave great curl and I got tons of compliments on my hairstyle back then. Style lasted all day. I just bought this, excited at the prospect at reliving those good hair days. But, alas, I haven't found the secret to ""curls that last for days"" or even hours. I've even tried leaving these things on for over 20 minutes and I've tried having completely dry, unwashed hair and leaving them in for 20 minutes. Not great curl and it doesn't last If something changes, (it's 12/20/08 today), I'll get back to ya."
1,USED ONLY 3 TIMES AND IT BROKE,MY WIFE HAD ONE OF THE OLDER TYPES AND LOVED IT.IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW ONE.THE NEW ONE WAS USED THREE TIMES AND THEN IT BROKE.
1,a disappointment for anyone who has used the old Clairol steam rollers,"I read the reviews and bought this based on the fact that I had used the old clairol steam roller system and remember the great curl and condition of my hair. For years I have used a curling iron and it is doing it's damage unless I cut my hair quite short. I got the big system yesterday and used it this morning. Not difficult to handle, but the curl, despite long times in the hair, was totally inadequate. I had to go over each one with the curling Iron. I now have one more big item I won't use. It came with three additional boxes of rollers too. Sad, for me."
5,Hair curler O.K.,This is the only brand my wife uses. They have a long life span and are a good value for the $$
5,My third,This is my third Caruso. The steam set leaves your curls with an entirely different look. It's also much easier on the hair than the hot rollers I use occassionally. My favorite feature is that you steam each individual roller before using -- all are freshly steamed when applied.
3,"Great product, horrible shipping",We received our package today. I ordered it for my wife last week. The box it came in was torn on one half. The original tape was broken and the person who opened it put cheap white tape on it. The steamer box inside the mailing box was opened as well. The gift card that was supposed to come with the package was removed.The barcode on the shipping label was torn and the delivery person was unable to scan the code. The code had to be put into the system by hand. The delivery person talked with her manager and they said it could be that the box could have been pushed to hard in the truck. I don't think so since the other half of the box is in great condition.If I could show you guys a picture you would see how ridiculous it is.Other than that the product works great.
4,Works Better than I Expected,I am truly surprised by how well these curlers work. My only complaint that there were too many large/jumbo rollers that came with the set and I had to order more medium sized rollers. The other reviews for the product were helpful and truthful. My hair is thick so it takes little longer for the curl to set in but I am pleased with the results. I always get compliments.
2,Disapointed,"I am an African-American woman with fine, relaxed hair. I have used the hairsetter about 5 times now and my hair does not keep the curl. I have used setting lotion, let the curlers absorb more steam or less steam and have tried using the blow dryer on them while in my hair, but my hair comes out slightly frizzy and then the curl is gone in a couple of hours."
1,Complete waste of money!,This is the biggest waste of money ever! I have naturally straight hair & I recently colored it. I bought these rollers so that I don't do more damage to my hair. My hair has never held a curl with these. I have tried steaming the roller for more time & for less time than the booklet says. I also leave them in for a minimum of 45 minutes. Still the curl will not hold for more than 30 min. & the curl that it does give is super weak. Now when I want a little curl in my hair I have to resort to using a curling iron. Such a bummer!
2,No user manual,This hairset that does not include a user's manual. I find this unacceptable. I have spent over 1 hour on the Internet trying to find some instructions and there is nothing available.
5,Incredibly pleased.,"I have used a curling iron most of my life, but was interested in hot rollers so I decided to give these a shot. I couldn't be more excited. I'm still mastering the art of actually rolling my hair around the curlers (I always have trouble getting the ends wound around the roller neatly), but the curl holds very well. I'm not getting the days-long lasting curl that some other users are reporting, but they are very solid for at least 12-15 hours. The varied selection of roller sizes that comes with this unit will definitely give you an idea of what will work best for you."
1,not for anyone who is familiar with the old clairol steam setter,"A disappointment. Mine arrived yesterday and I used it today. It's pretty easy to use, but the curl is weak. I bought it based on reviews and my history of some years back having a clairol steam setter. It was so good for my hair I thought it was time to give up the curling iron. Wrong. I had to go over each curl with the iron to get a substantial curl with body. Sad, now I have a full system to add to unused articles. Not cheap enough for one use."
3,not as spectacular as expected,"These curlers are ok. I guess it's worth it since it's not going to damage my hair like hot rollers or curling irons, that makes me glad I got it, but the results are just ok. The curls don't stay that long, and the shape/texture of the curl is messier, not smooth & polished like hot rollers. I got excited when I read the reviews, it sounded so great, but doesn't actually perform like some reviewers said. Maybe it does for their hair, but not mine. I'd recommend if your hair is getting damaged from heat over use, as mine was getting to be, then it's worth the switch, regardless. But don't expect miracles."
4,"Wow, what curl!","I haven't used rollers for years but decided to try these because curling with a hot iron was drying my hair out badly at the ends now that I have grown it longer. The first time I used these, the first curl I unrolled sprang up and hit me in the forehead! I am learning how to use them to get the tightness of curl I want. I like them because my hair is no longer dry and brittle at the ends and looks healthier. I have the snap on clips that came with the set and have not had any problems with them. I wish they would have included some of the other type of clips so I could have tried them as well. Other than my skills at rolling and styling, I have no complaints about the set and it heats up really fast so I can touch up quickly if I need to."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I have had my roller set for a little over 2 months. During that time I have used this product 2 times. Of those 2 times, I was only pleased with the result once. Yesterday, I decided to roll my hair and give this product another chance. The problem is, the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter would not heat up. It actually began to have an electrical smell after several minutes of heating so I unplugged the unit. Additionally, I had to order extra rollers, incurring more cost, because the rollers sent with the set were not sufficient to roll my long hair. Since I am outside of the return window, I will have to eat the cost of the hairsetting set and the extra rollers."
5,still the best!,"I've also used caruso since the ""salt"" days, I still have my old salt travel steamer (it still works), but I bought the new ion one because it was actually cheaper to get the set than to replace all of the old curlers. The curls do indeed last for days, and i've seen no difference between this ion and the old salt version, as far as curls go. Yes, the ion setting is loud and makes an annoying noise, but you don't have to use the ion setting. A couple of tips, if your curls don't last for days, or ""fall"" after an hour or so, it is probably that you have hard water. This happened to me when we moved into a new home and was quickly (but not cheaply) resolved by getting a water softner. Also, if you use distilled water in the steamer, you won't get mineral build up and the product will last longer. love it!"
2,Curls went Flat...,"I bought this product in hopes of getting flawless results for hours in a day. I have very thin, very healthy, and very straight hair. When I tried this product,I first left it in for 10-15-20 minutes on three different occasions. I'm not saying this product was horrible because its results came out great each time; voluminous curls, light hair, no frizz, and healthy shine. The big BUT is that it did not stay in tact for 24 hours like advertised. Maybe it's just my hair, but my hair literally went flat in a matter of minutes. I even tried using hairspray (which I despise), one of the 3 times I tested this product and yet it still went flat with very light, unattractive waves. Thus, my overall thought of this product is not so great."
4,Works Great,"I used to have a Caruso, but it was huge. This one is much smaller and takes up very little space. It heats quickly and is very easy to use. It works so well that I use only the large rollers. I haven't even tried any of the smaller sizes because I'm afraid I'd look like Shirley Temple! My curls last all day even in the hot humid weather we experience in Austin, Texas. This time around I use only distilled water (using Texas tap water messed up my old unit). I'm very pleased with my purchase."
2,Difficult to understand,"Although I have taken courses in multivriate statistics, I had a very difficult time getting through the second chapter in this text. Certainly, there must be something that is easier to understand. The author writes as if he spent his whole life inside the ivory tower and gravitates towards three and four syllable words. I thought that this book would be simple to uderstand because it is targeted to students in the social sciences. I thought wrong!"
4,Useful for SAS users without a deep love of stats,"This textbook has been useful for my work (using SAS) on interrupted time series analysis. Fairly useful examples, but very few examples using transfer functions, which is my interest. Overall, this has been an excellent resource for developing my time series models, and the SAS code is especially helpful. I'd recommend it to others that are not econometrics experts interested in using ARIMA models, but may be intimidated by other highly statistical texts."
3,Where's the data?,"Anybody know where to download the data and SAS code for this book? I can't find it anywhere, and the link in the book doesn't work.Thanks a lot."
4,Vaulable for all people learning econometrics,"""Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Applications of SAS and SPSS"" is the best textbook in the area of econometrics that I ever read so far. It demonstrates detail programme language of SAS and SPSS for time series analysis and Forecasting which make this book distinguishable from others. I found the explanation of the programme language (right beside the programme) is easy to read and make me understand SAS and SPSS more, especially for the beginner of these programmes. Besides the programme language, the text itself also explains the concepts and the equations of the time series analysis and econometrics in an easy to understand and orgainzed way. This is definitely a good tool book for people learning econometrics."
1,BEWARE!!,"Within one month of implementing this method to avoid pregnancy we were pregnant. We followed my cycle for a full 6 months without having intercourse - very difficult but important since we were not ready to have children. As a scientist, I fell for all of the evidence listed in the book, but unlike a scientist, I failed to question it. There is a lot more evidence out there that this method does not work. Be on guard, do your research, and be prepared!"
5,Do your body a favor - use the Billings Method of NFP,"This under-rated book deserves far more exposure than it has received. Imagine a method of family planning that is natural, harmless, 99.9% effective, is beneficial to couple communication in a marriage, and in keeping with one's relationship with God. That's what the Billings Method offers.Aside from a course in the method, this is an excellent primer on how the Method works. It is a method that will not harm a woman's future fertility (as oral contraceptives do), and will help a woman determine when she is fertile (great for couples having trouble conceiving).It is a method which works - we've used it 100% effectively to both postpone and conceive. It has been the best thing we could have ever done for our marriage, our relationship with one another, and our relationship with God."
4,This book was exceptional for learnin natural birth control.,This book was exceptional for natural birth control methods. It provided an insite to the timing and control one must have to practice this method. I want to recommend this book to anyone interested in birth control.
4,"REALISTIC, Historic Fiction for Readers with Patience","This Newberry Award winner is a classic that may best be appreciated by readers with patience for a slower lifestyle. This is not for action-adventure junkies waiting for a roller coaster ride of thrills and suspense. I enjoyed this book because I am familiar with the setting in Northern New Mexico around Taos, which is well described in the book. For hundreds of years ranch owners have sent their shepherds and sheep to the green grazing fields in the local mountains during the summer months. The desire to go to the mountains with the sheep would have been a common personal conflict with older children. As a work of realistic fiction, it portrays a real lifestyle with real dreams and conflicts in a time and place before our modern technology, noise, and adrenaline surges of a rushed, stressed based lifestyle. This book is for the sophisticated reader who is looking for a good story in a work of historical fiction."
1,The Most Boring BookI ever Read,"I think this book was so boring! I also think that the summary on the back of the book was a lie. He did not have ""devasting"" consquences. Please! I mean, you tell me what was so ""devasting"". I'm all ears. This book was so boring. Who wants to hear about how you brand sheep? Uh, no one! This book all most put me to sleep. El boringo."
1,Patrick Richview Middle,"The book I read was ..And Now Miguel. The book was about this kid who wanted to write poetry, but his dad didnt want him to because he thought men shouldnt write poetry . During the story Miguel sneaks behind his dad`s back and writes poetry for school. So when his teacher calls his house to tell his poetry.So when his dad finds out he gets furious at him and locks him in his room. When Miguel starts to write with his teacher at the end of the story. This was ok but i wouldnt read it again."
4,Dry,Found this book to be very dry.It is really Galileo's storyas his daughter was cloistered in a convent by him.However the relationship between science and the Church is fascinating.
2,I thought it was about his DAUGHTER!,"Yes, Galileo was ahead of his time. He was brilliant, a genius, and a good man to boot. But, the title of the book is ""Galileo's Daughter."" Yet, only 30-40 percent of the book is about her, and the rest rambles ad nauseum about Galileo's writings, aches & pains, trials & tribulations. I already know about that!His daughter was a fascinating woman, and though much information about her specifically is lost, much information about convent life must exist, and therefore, conjecture could be made and more could have been inferred about what her life must have entailed."
3,Disappearing Daughter,"Don't look too hard for the ""life"" of Gaileleo's daughter in this otherwise interesting book: it's mainly about Gaileleo, and probably should be, given that his daughter's life seemed grim and uneventful, and her letters not nearly so interesting as one might hope, given the (pre) publicity on the book. The rest of the book is fairly absorbing without her, however, especially for readers that are not already familiar with Gaileleo's genius, work, and subsequent travails with the Catholic Church."
4,Charming read,"Reading letters to Galileo from his daughter is something every scientist, historian, or interested reader can now enjoy. Dava Sobel tirelessly hunted across continents for the letters, and then learned Italian in order to translate them into English. The result is a splendid and insightful collection, revealing the Galileo that history forgot. Instead of the familiar and legendary iconoclastic Church-challenging rebel, we see a pious man who fathered two nuns and spent a great deal of time trying to reconcile his science with his God. This book will sweep you away to a time and place full of conflict and misunderstanding, a place that hasn't existed for four hundred years, but is undeniably very present today."
4,"Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, a","There were several reasons I really enjoyed this book. It was well written which was no mean task as someone needed to fill in the history between Galileo's daughter's letters. Secondly, as a scientist, it was fasciniating to try to understand the world through Galileo's eye's and mind. Third, as a physician I have a special interest in middle age medicine. Galileo's dauhgter's letters were filled with interesting details of medical concepts of the middle ages. Fourth, it was fascinating to see the unnecessary tension between the church and science portrayed through the letters and Galileo's response. I have already recommended it to my physician friends."
2,Little else to say.,"Apparently this is one of those books that either snags or bores the reader. I'm afraid I'm in the camp of those who were disappointed. This narrative is much too lengthy, heavily reminiscent of textbook style, and as many Amazon reviewers have noted, not about the daughter but the father. Medieval history, religion, and folklore are among my very favorite areas of study, but I'm afraid I couldn't finish this particular volume."
3,Galileo's Daughter - quality of printing,"I loaned my original copy of this book and never got it back. I enjoyed reading it so much that I decided I wanted a copy for my library. I am really disappointed in the printing quality of this hardback edition by Walker Publishing. The paper itself is poor quality, and the edges of the pages are extremely uneven; shabby is the word."
2,Do not car for this book,"Someone in our Book Club recommended it. I have read over half - making myself read it. I like science and experiments, but it is way too much information for my interest of the story."
4,Just as good the second time around...,"I first read this book back in 1999 and was impressed with the scope and sheer readability of what could have been a fairly dry topic. When the book was republished in 2011 with a new preface by Dava Sobel I was intrigued enough to read it again and see if my initial impression held. The preface itself is extremely interesting. We are told of Galileo's near-inclusion aboard Juno, the latest spacecraft bound for Jupiter, scheduled for launch in August 2011. (Liftoff did indeed occur at 12:25 p.m. EDT on August 5th). The idea was proposed that a tiny sliver of Galileo's vertebrae be included aboard Juno. Sadly, the request was denied on the grounds that the spectre of a ""holy relic"" would be raised.The preface includes other interesting details like the above mentioned one and makes re-reading ""Galileo's Daughter"" just as good the second time through."
3,Not as good as the Longitude,"Sobel's Longitude was truly a great book. Galileo's daughter is OK but doesn't quite measure up. It is (as the cover says) a book about faith, love, and science. The letters from Galileo's daughter are interesting to a point but become so repetitive that I ended up skipping them. The biography of Galileo is the meat of the book. Perhaps unlike others it reveals some of his weaknesses as well as his successes. This isn't a gripping book, but it is worth finishing."
3,An Interesting Chapter of History,"Galileo lived in a fascinating time and Sobel works very hard to bring this to life for the reader. At times it is hard to decide if she is writing about Galileo as a person, about his relationship to his daughter, about his scientific work or if she is writing about the lives of nuns in the 1600's or about the scientific and religious ideas of Galileo's time. Nevertheless, she does a pretty good job combining all the elements. This is definitely an interesting examination of the Galileo case that challenges the idea that Galileo planned defy the power of the church. An interesting read to be sure, but not the `splendid and moving book' the cover claims it to be."
3,Don't Know Much About Astronomy,"It is refreshing to read a work of scientific history told, by virtue of the extant documents, from the viewpoint of a woman. ""Gallileo's Daughter,"" welcomes us to make assumptions about the actual role Sister Marie Celeste played in the fascinating intellectual world in which her father lived. If nothing else, this book made me realize that I don't know spit about astronomy, and I am looking for a good general text to start making up for this failing. To my mind, any book that piques my curiosity and leads to new lessons is a very good book indeed."
4,Good read,"Its hard to believe how people lived back in the 1500's.How the Catholic Church control everything,including severe punishment for anyone who did not conform.Galileo's Daughter is an historical book with a look into the past.If this book is enjoying to you read others by the same author ."
4,Galileo's Daughter,"The use of actual letters written by Galileo's daughter to the famous scientist is an interesting approach for structuring this biography of a fascinating man who made enormous contributions mathematics, physics, and astronomy. The book is easy to read and highly informative."
2,Galileo's Daughter?,"This book was a disappointment. After all of the press, I was anxious to learn more about Suor Maria Celeste, her life and (from her perspective) Galileo. While the letters are beautifully written and offer a limited insight into her life, they are not integrated well into the story. Don't be mistaken, the story here is about Galileo alone and,while fascinating, the read is dull. Those interested in the factual detail of Galileo's amazing life will be satisfied. Those of us that bought the book based on the premise of the title and the misleading reviews will feel shortchanged."
5,Excellent! Very interesting.,Need i say more? It is a glimpse into the personal life of a historical figure that is both interesting and well written.
3,Disappointing...,"In consultation with my book group, we agreed that it was difficult to maintain an interest in the storyline because Suor Maria Celeste was not a compelling character. We were excited about Galileo's creativity, determination, and political savvy. We agree with the reviewer who noted that the title was misleading. It would have been more interesting to simply focus on Galileo and his accomplishments."
4,"Lovely, but not quite heavenly...","Rather than rehash the outline, which has been accomplshed by many editorial and customer reviews, I want to include a bit of a cautionary note. I just finished the book, and am very glad I read it. The themes of religion vs. science, the individual vs. the collective, portrayed in juxtapostion with the filial relationship of Galileo and his daughter, are skillfully rendered. Perhaps it took me a while to become involved in the period and with the people, but I found the first third of the book to be a bit plodding. Granted, I am not a fan of biography and tend toward literary fiction, but the buzz on this book was such that I felt compelled to read it. Others similarly situated may do well to wait for the paperback edition, or at least take the time to really look at the book in the library. For readers with a greater scientific bent than I, this would be a genuine pleasure."
4,Great!,"My friends & I read this for a book club, and what a winner! To read about the daily mundane activities in the convent, to see the love between father & daughter, and to be up-close & personal with such pivotal moments in history as Galileo's trial & the birth of the scientific method were truly thrilling. I was a little disappointed that the book did not explore Marie Celeste's life in even more detail, but I suppose that is the consequence of having so little information available about her."
2,A Treatise on the Nature of the Text,"Further proof that nonfiction is not fit for publishing. While I thoroughly enjoyed the author's book _Longitude_, I have little interest in the goings-on of daughters of famous scientists who ""proved"" certain ""theories"" about the ""revolutions"" of the ""heavenly"" ""spheres."" There is very little science, and even less faith and love in this tiresome text."
1,BORING!,"I would have given this book 0 stars but that wasn't an option. This was one of the most boring books I have ever read and the letters from Galileo's daughter did nothing to increase the appeal of the book. There were too many characters and the names became confusing after a while. For any reader with no scientific background, this book is an impossible chore. I would not recommend this book."
3,Not as good as Longitude!,"Although compelling at times, the story of Galileo as told, partly, through the letters of his daughter were simply not as interesting to me as the story of John Harrison and contained too much of the mundane detail of life in 17th century Italy. This effort, too, seems less carefully edited than Harrison's tale as much of the author's language goes way over the head of the historically uninitiated."
5,Best book I have read in a long time,"I read the book during Lent this year. I have admired Gallileo for a long time and I was happy when the church finally pardoned him and admitted that he was right (400 years later).The book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I laughed and cried. I didn't expect his daughter to pass away before him. And I cried when she was found buried beneath him. What a pure love story!!Since I have a love/hate relationship with the Catholic Church (I am a church employee), I found Gallileo's struggles compelling and all to familiar for our day and age.I would highly recommend this book to anyone!!!"
2,Was this about Galileo's daughter?,"I read all the reviews and thought this would be a good read about Galileo's daughter and her life. Ummm...not! It's about Galileo and his fight with the Roman Catholic Church. Oh, and there's some small bits and pieces thrown in about his daughter.I was very disappointed in this book; I was expecting to learn about Suor Maria Celeste (the ""Daughter"" of the title), and had to wade through all the well known historical details about Galileo for small glimpses at Maria Celeste's world. The title of this book should have been ""All About Galileo (And a Little About His Daughter)""."
4,A noble effort,"I admire the author for attempting this work, based upon only one side of a correspondence between father and daughter. The daughter's life was rather mundane, as her letters revealed. The father's life was much more interesing, but we don't have his letters to illuminate, and are therefore left with the standard biographical details. Given the framework within which the author was required to work, the results are good but, I think, might have been better."
2,Boring,"Historical fiction is my preferred genre, and I was excited to read this. However, this is more non-fiction. The development of the story and characters is too slow for me. I gave up after @ 100 pages."
2,Penguin Targets Female Buyers (Was it TitleVII?),"There is an interesting untold story here ...of fornication and illegitimacy without ""Inquisition"" and corrupt and gruelling convent life during the same period Jamestown and the Plymouth Colony were founded. While a good biography of Gallileo this is no story of the father and daughter relationship nor a story of the daughter's life or calling."
2,Skip this one,"Concur with ""Reader from Virginia"", this is not Sobel's best effort. I'd hazard a guess that her publisher insisted she come out with something (anything) to follow up the buzz from ""Longitude"" which came out way back in 1995. Read that if you haven't already as it is wonderful but, skip this one."
5,Fascenating and inspirational,"I adored this book! It has everything I look for- amazing characters, beautiful writing, and marvelous historical discriptions. The added bonus was learning about the birth of moder-day science. This book was an inspiration to me, the awe-inspiring figures of Galileo and his daughter, their touching relationship and the scope of historial influences on their life. I also found the author, Dava Sobel, whom I heard speak last month at the Natural History Museum in NYC, equally inspirational. How wonderful it is to hear someone speak so elequently about their passion!"
4,"Science, heresy, and the banalities of life in a convent","This book is a mix of history about Galileo, his science, and his trial, and the letters his daughter wrote to him from the convent. A previous reviewer complained that the letters are boring and should be skipped over. Yes, the letters are not groundbreaking in the way that Galileo's scientific letters were, but that is why they are fascinating: they provide clues as to what ordinary life in the average convent of the time was like. This book demonstrates the complexity of Galileo's relationship with the church of that time--on the one hand, he could be forced by his friend Pope Urban to abjure his book supporting the Copernican view of the universe, yet on the other he was intimately involved in supporting the upkeep of the convent where his daughters lived. It's as much a book about the society of 17th century Tuscany and Rome as it is about Galileo's correspondence with his daughter."
3,A flowing but scarcely significant reading,"In spite of the title, which could have denoted a more specific subject, the book deals mainly about Galileo's events, told in the way anybody knows. The life of Galileo's daughter would have been a very interesting opportunity to exam this issue from a quite different perspective. This opportunity vanishes yet in the first chapters, and the tale of Suor Maria Celeste (the name she got as a nun) becomes a mere translation of her letters collected by Galileo. Besides, you can hardly find something new even among them. That facilitated history (tabloid-like) flows easily, but it lacks of reality: you can hardly believe that Galileo'daughter accepted so willingly the fate her father decided when she was a child. Surely a not remarkable book for people who have yet read something about the subject, but that can be very useful to High School students."
5,HISTORY COMES TO LIFE!,"Once again we are presented with a story that should be mandatory in every school room. Gailelo's Daughter's not only made for fascinating reading, it brought out the human side of the great man; his familial relationships and his dedication to both church and science. During the Inquisition, I felt not only a reader, but a spectator in the most unjust trial of the church times.Galileo's Daughter is not just a great contribution to the world of history through the reader's eyes, it is a wonderful discussion novel that stays with the reader long after the book is closed."
2,The sort of book which makes reading a chore,"The scale of Ms Sobel's research and the amount of time which she doubtlessly invested in this project fail to prevent the end product from being a surprisingly tiresome and boring book. The title itself is misleading - it is essentially another biography of Galileo - so if you bought it, as I did, hoping for a new slant on the father-daughter relationship, you're in for a disappointment. If you do feel you want to read it, I suggest you visit your local library and save your hard-earned cash."
1,jschlick,"Quite frankly I'm appalled that this book is available on Amazon for just anyone to buy. I get that this book is supposed to have a ""WOW"" factor but its a brutal read of very graphic and disturbing sexual interactions. I don't think this book should be available for just anyone to buy. I really enjoyed other Piers Anthony books that I read in high school. No high school student should read this book it's disturbing as an adult! There was nothing enjoyable about reading this book, which is sad. Do not buy this book. It's so terrible I don't know what to do with it. I don't want it on my shelf and I don't want to donate it anywhere."
5,Used Book: Thessalonians I & II,My item arrived within the time frame I was expecting and was a good used book. I'm very satistifed
4,Good compilation of articles - but repeat information,"If you have read The Essential Drucker, Balanced scorecard etc. , the book essentially has the same information repeated under a different title. Recommend Essential Drucker, Balanced Score card which is more comprehensive than this title."

1,"Bought 2, both SUCKED.","I bought two of these controlers because they were on sale for very cheap. I got what I paid for.The first performed admirably for about 2 months - I thought I had gotten a great deal. After that, the control started listing to the left during gameplay. Reseting it would solve the problem, for about 5 minutes. With time, the listing got worse and worse until it was really just impossible to play with. I popped open the second controler, hoping it was just a fluke. The second controler started doing the SAME THING after about 2 weeks.These controlers have a manufacurers gaurantee, but you have to ship the thing back to them on your own dime AND send them about $8 to get a replacement shipped back to you - that would end up being more than I paid for one in the first place.These controlers are just no good! Go with another brand!"
2,Wasn't as desribed,"Case was damaged and the CD had a weird white noise that covered the whole CD. The seller was great in refunded me and adding the cost to ship back. Their manager was nice and I was impressed the way she handled everything. I did get another copy, this is a great CD loaded with great songs."
4,Great price on these,"I purchased these because of the price and the fact that they were not glass.They're attractive and colorful, but take up a fair amount of space to store.I'm also hesitant to put them in the dishwasher so only gave them 4 stars."
4,"Shadowrun, 4th Ed.","This is the 4th incarnation of the Shadowrun game. I have played Shadowrun since the original release. This book is a continuation of the timeline. The ""history"" is updated and new items are added.A new rules system has been used and from my initial read through, seems to work better than the old.If you are fan of Shadowrun or are interested in getting started, I highly recommend this book."
3,Great game... if you ever get the books,"I was recently introduced to the world of Shadowrun and greatly enjoyed it.I then called around to all the local game shops and they were all sold out of the current 4th edition books. So I figured I'd just use Amazon as they are normally quite reliable. However I placed my order with them on November 5th, and I've yet to get the books. I've had to approve the delay in the order twice so far and as of right now Delivery is scheduled for Janurary 6th.If I get another delay I'll just cancel the books. But I look forward to playing again. Guess I'll just purchase the downloadable PDF version of the books."
3,where is the music?,"Although this is a good CD of upbeat music, the first CD is by far the best out of the two, half the music you hear on the show is not on this CD or the first one. Perhaps the third installment will have more from the show."
5,"Great Dance CD, Forget if it's ""Gay"" Music or Not","This is a great dance CD, even if you have never seen the show. It's pretty low on the ""Gay Anthem"" songs that I am not so crazy about, and the best part is that it's already mixed very well together, so it's a great mixtape all ready to go. I played the whole thing at a party a few weeks ago, and everyone was jammin' out to it, because there are no real throw-away songs on it. The highlight is Etta James signing everyone else under the table with a dance mix of the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You"". The next-best song is ""Hide U"", which sets the tone for the whole CD."
2,queer as folk : a 2nd disaapointment,"just like the whole 2nd season, this is pretty disappointing too! This includes NONE of the great songs heard weekly. Why can't we get what we hear weekly..( so carefully chosen, we might add). Unfortunately, that brilliance and direction are truly missing here."
1,Will not work with V3m,"Software would not recognize my V3m. Disk that I received was different. It was black and did not have the Motorola logo on it. I contacted software company on internet and was informed that this was not a licensed copy of the software and they would not be able to help me.It may work for other phones, but it will not work on the Razr V3m.The battery and cable work fine, but I bought it for the software."
2,"disappointing, just nice illustrations","very disappointing, as well as boring!!generalities, of little help.have seen simple, cheap books with better ideas and tips.the writer might be a grandmaster , but this will not help othercreatures.""forget"" about this book."
1,Short and vacuous,"This book contains a lot of fluff and not a lot of content. Lots of exercises, most of them useless and extraneous. Only a handful of pages even mention the DOMINIC system let alone delve into it. The book lists a lot of different memorization techniques, but glosses over all of them including the important ones. Rather than specifically teaching you how to remember, the book presents a discourse on memory and memorization with brief highlights on how to actually apply them yourself. The only real techniques are about three quarters of the way through the book, and each technique is only given a page or two. I was really disappointed after reading this book; O'Brien's other books on memory are far superior on all points and for all purposes."
2,"wishywashy rehash of his previous work, buy his other books!","i found this book very dissapointing compared to dominics previous works, it seemed to be written or eddited by someone different from his previous books, the style of writting was completely different and why does this book have a co-author which isnt mentioned on the cover?? he covers most of the material in much more detail in 'how to develop a perfect memory' and 'how to pass exams' much better buys if you can find them, if you cant then i guess this book is alright, covers the main ideas, and i guess it is a good colourfull introduction to memory for the beginner, if this isnt you then there are better books out there by this author, tho they are hard to find."
4,Quality Soundtrack,"Though there are a couple of songs that I'm not completely drawn into, Gangsta's Paradise is worth the cost of the album alone."
4,THE MANY SIDES OF TAKE 6,"Though widely known for their innovative A Cappella, this release celebrates the many styles of Take 6, and that's fine with me. Not only are they comfortable with the likes of MARY, A QUIET PLACE, SPREAD LOVE, or SO MUCH 2 SAY, but supply the instruments and they're just as fantastic with BIGGEST PART OF ME, DESTINY, or the two new selections: ONE AND THE SAME(with CeCe Winans) and THE BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD TODAY CAFE. Both absolutely incredible! As you can tell, I'm not a strict advocate of ""only A Cappella for Take 6."" These guys are much too talented to be limited to one style or genre. My only complaint? Though this may represent their ""Greatest Hits,"" and they are a good sampling of the fellas, the omissions are far too noticeable. Surely we can expect a second CD sometime in the near future? Maybe even the rare Japanese recordings(I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU and ALMOST PARADISE)?Enjoy their diversity."
3,Take 6 Greatest Hits,"There were some good cuts on this cd, but I've heard so many other Take 6 songs that I liked a whole lot better...however, that's just my opinion. Maybe these cuts were considered greatest hits because they made lots of money; yet I don't feel that they show all the many talents and facets of this truly gifted group."
5,The Best Vocal Group!,"Take 6 is, without a doubt, the greatest vocal group of all time. This album is a compilation of their best works and it showcases their fantastic talents. This album is worth it!"
3,Beware,"Ring was B-E-A-utiful but within 10 months 1 of the small pearls fell off, its a shame too because my wife loved it so much."
4,I loved the originality of REALLY communicating with plants!,"As a first novel, I throughly enjoyed this imaginative book. Ms Elze opened a world of conjecture I had never contemplated and fleshed it out wonderfully. The main characters are well developed and should be used in future novels. They could grow along with Ms Elze's skills. I would love to read more of her work."
2,A Fizzle!,"I had bought this book in the hopes that I would be getting a real hair-raiser! Alas, what I ended up getting was a dud. The story starts out promising enough, but then it goes off on a tangent-bringing the story to an unexpected direction that seems to have nothing to do with its beginning! There were other aspects to the story which had promise, but they were ultimitely abandoned with absolutely no explaination! Truly a dissapointment! The CHANGELING GARDEN was in bad need of fertilizer, for it simply did'nt bloom for this reader!"
4,Another winner from Swain,"Mr. Lucky is a fun read. If you are a gambler and a purist, you will spot some holes in the logic of this book, but you have to be pretty uptight to allow that to spoil your enjoyment. Having read all of the Tony Valentine books, I am happy to see that his son is finally starting to display some common sense. Not a lot, but some. This is a quick read, so put on your sneakers."
4,"Entertaining, fast-paced: a fun mystery","Tony Valentine, ex-cop, specializes in casino gambling scams. Ricky Smith comes to his attention after a phenomenal run of good luck in Las Vegas. Not only does Smith miraculously escape a raging hotel fire, but he cleans the clock at a casino with a phenomenal string of bank-breaking wins at roulette, craps, even triumphing over the world's greatest poker player.Can anyone be so lucky? Valentine's job is to find out.The plot takes off from there. Valentine goes to the small town of Slippery Rock NC to quietly investigate. His cover is soon blown and Ricky Smith becomes his inseparable companion and goes on to win at horse racing, even a raffle.Swain does a marvelous job of complicating the plot at every turn, without losing his way. The characters, including Valentine's errant son, are richly detailed and believable.The conclusion is (happily) difficult to predict and by the time you're time, the entire experience is satisfying. Swain is good!Jerry"
2,Flimsy,"Not very sturdy and the I'm not a fan of the swiveling action of the clip. The swivel mechanism holds the Stiletto away from the belt so I frequently hit things with it.I was looking for a true clip, but that's not what this is."
3,Belt Clip,Works great if you don't have the protective cover on it. It has a very tight fit and won't allow for any type of exterior cover to be in the clip with it.
3,It is very hard to find your type.,"While I found this book very interesting, I thought it was really confusing at the same time. I had a really hard time figuring out my type. The author suggests using ""muscle testing"" to find your type, but she does not tell you what kinds of tests to use. I tried to have my practitioner test me, but she had no idea what tests to use either. I think it is a really great concept, but it should be easier to ""type"" yourself."
4,More Classic Nicktoons on DVD,"The original shows unedited...as they were first shown on Nick. The print quality is superb, the audio is digital to enhance the sound--and this is Close Captioned as well."
5,valreview,"Beautiful assembly of older recordings by many who are no longer in public memory. Although a bit disconcerting hearing Lazy River by other than the Mills Brothers, all the tracks are wonderful."
4,very good,"it was pretty easy to make these flowers and i think it was a great deal for this kit to include the stencils, stems, AND all this paper! the flowers turn out great and there are clear instructions 4 every flower. the only problem is that it takes a lot of cutting and the tissue is so delicate that it easily tears. also, it gets very messy w/all the scraps of paper & stencils. other than that, like i said, it turns out great."
5,Crafty perfection for all skill levels,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a grown-up who bought this book to share with children and ended up enjoying it tremendously as a craft project for myself. This book is so beautifully designed with clear easy-to-follow directions and plenty of supplies to get you started. I think it would make a great gift for children as young as age five all the way up to the most crafty adult crafter."
4,Fun book,"I have made several flowers in this book, and it is pretty easy and fun. The only thing about this is that they don't show you how to make EVERY single flower pictured. But it is enough to get started to create your own flowers."
4,Donkeydog,We loved this!! The flowers look great!! We spent the whole weekend trying all the patterns with every paper we could find in the house!! Fun!!Only wish they had plastic instead of the paper patterns. It would make the flowers easier to cut and the fun last longer.
4,a fun craft for ages 6-10,"a very fun craft project. my kids have spent hours with this one. the patterns are fairly easy for kids, and a few need adult help. i recommend this craft."
5,Simply the best,"The best nail file I have ever used. When I first got it, I thought it seemed too fine to file, but I was wrong... it is fantastic, and being fine like it is, it is gentle on your nails. I have used various crystal nail files, but none are as good as this one."
5,Throw out your emery boards,"Metal files take off a lot of nail quickly but leave ragged edges; emery boards leave smooth edges but clog and wear out very quickly.This file works far better than either other type - it removes more nail more quickly, leaves much smoother edges, and returns to 'like new' condition with a quick rinse of water.Wish I'd discovered these years ago; I'll never go back to disposable emery boards or metal nail files.I haven't tried other crystal or porcelain files available on Amazon yet, but it's hard to imagine something working better than this excellent, inexpensive product."
3,Shorter than I expected,This is a great file for problem nails and came to me in a plastic tube to help protect. The only thing I didn't like was the length of the file. I was used to one about 8 inches long. This one is a runt. It is about 5 inches long. The advertisement for this file doesn't tell you it's size.
3,Works but too brittle,"This file works very well -- smoothes my nails quickly & with these. However, I managed to snap it in half while cleaning it. I didn't think I was rough on it."
1,Arrived snapped in 4 pieces - flimsy junk,Came in a plastic tube and the seller wrapped it in bubble wrap however it was snapped in 4 pieces. Buyer beware!
1,Beak On First Use,"I never write a review on Amazon.com or anywhere online. But this item totally deserve to be reviewed!I was so looking for my purchase on Amazon. It finally arrived today, but... it broke into two pieces on my first use.DON'T BUY !"
5,"Wonderful, As Always!!",This product is the ONLY one I can use on my fingernails. It doesn't shred your nails or break them down like other nail files do. These are the only ones you should be using on your nails!!
1,"zero stars, really.","I have used many different crystal nail files, and this is by far the worst. It snapped on the first use, though I wasn't putting any pressure on it at all. I still use one of the shards, and the surface grit has not dulled.I much prefer the NailTek XL or the Essie crystal file. In any case, no matter what file you buy, make sure it is a true crystal file as opposed to a glass file with grit adhered to it."
3,"Looks nice, but i prefer a normal file","This looks lovely, though is very delicate and to be honest, i prefer the control you get with a normal (card) file better"
4,"Good sound, docking station isn't great.","The sound is great, however when adapting to use the Stiletto the cradle does not fit in quite right. It may be a flaw in manufacturering, as it appears it should screw in, but the holes don't line up properly. Once you get it set into place it connects and works fine however."
2,Good if you don't want to wake up.,"One of my main reasons for buying this stereo was for the ability to wake up to my ipod. However, it doesn't work half the time. The directions for wake up to the ipod or sirius are abysmal. They tell you how to program the stereo to wake up, but not what to do with your ipod/sirius. I have yet to be able to figure it out which has left me using my ol' phone on through out the night with the volume up. Given my family's penchant for being ""morning people"" and their love of communication, this means I wake up about an hour earlier than I would prefer everyday. But that's neither here nor there. Just be aware that if you don't care for the alarm then you'll like the product. Although it is difficult to get my ipod into the cradle. I had to take off the case I had on it."
4,Great product!,"I've used this many, many times and works great as long as there is a decent signal. It's been used in a few different locations and I'm very happy with it. It's a great way to enjoy satellite radio at home."
1,"""No Return"" policy!","The dock wasn't able to get a signal in the office - when I tried to return the unit, I found out there is a ""no return"" policy! I've called everywhere, including Sirius, and made no progress. This was from Tiger Direct, by the way.It was not stated that the item couldn't be returned when I purchased this - so I'm obviously not happy. Will buy items locally from now on!"
3,"Not bad, not great","I bought this to replace my existing Xact boombox account with my Sportster account. I wanted to save a few pennies each month and believe Xact products and support are junk.Pluses: It looks great, classy. I could use my iPod on it. All definite pluses.Minus are more: The sound is so-so. The boombox had great base and resonated nicely. This, which uses an electrostatic technology, is very crisp, but lacks base. I'm still tinkering with the sound quality adjustments, but it is a noticeable variance.Also, the remote transmission/reception is poor. I must stand three feet or less from it to get an accurate power-off or else the unit cycles through the different modes: iPod, line in, etc. The remote uses the same button for Power and Mode. I'm not sure if this is a battery strength issue as I'm using the one that was enclosed.I'll keep it. But I'll keep the deactivated Xact handy in a closet."
1,Not for me,"Simple, really. The unit did'nt work for me. Once plugged in, my receiver, instead of displaying the name of the program or song I tried to tune in to, read ""Antenna not detected"". No antenna ( I tried several) no reception. Full disclosure: My old Soloist, which had worked fine for several years, started to produce the same display. The Stiletto receiver will work outside of the Soloist's cradle so I don't know which is at fault. All I know is the Soloist won't work for me."
1,"Horrible, don't even rent it",The acting is bad. The CG is worse. The script is horrendous. I can't believe I rented this. Look it was a shot in the dark. I was delirious. An hour had passed and finally I just grabbed and dashed. I felt sick as my hand closed over the copy but pushed the nausea away believing it to be a symptom from browser fatigue.Never consider this movie. Oh and Asylum movies in general. The previews showed at least 4 movies there could have been more but they all blended into one. I couldn't tell them apart because they use the SAME CG SEQUENCES FOR DIFFERENT MOVIES. Talk about your shoestring budgets.I feel bad for the actors in this.
1,Not for kids and too lame for adults,"We rented this tonight from Redbox because our son picked it out. Turns out this is a ""B"" rate movie. I cannot figure out who the audience is for. The story is geared for adults but the effects are so bad, that what adult would want to watch. But, really just wanted other to know this is not for kids. MAD"
3,Great fable of a film !!!,"Stars: Jane March & Jamie Thomas King.Directed by: Rachel Lee Goldenberg.This film has a look, Achieved by filming in AUSTRIA with it's exotic forests and castle-like structives of old.JANE MARCH (Clash Of The Titans,Color Of The Night and The Lover) is perfect as evil queen,Sorry to say but she is perfect in typecasting.JAMIE THOMAS KING (Tinker,Tailor,Soldier,Spy and The Tudors) is again wonderful as the lovelorn prince and hero.There are elves galore with each their own habits in LOTR type lore and pointed ears.The monsters,Which we don't believe are in most SNOW WHITE stories"
1,utter rubbish.,"We rented this from Redbox for my daughter but when we put it on the previews before the movie were NOT at all suitable for children. We then skipped this and watched maybe 5 mins of it before my daughter turned it off... It was utter rubbish and not even suitable for an Adult to watch, one with brains I may add.."
5,If you love Elves,"If you are the type that loves Elves in general, you can't help but love this version of Snow White. Ok, not for the perfectionist, but just a fun movie."
4,So Bad Its Good!!!,"Now I know that this movie was made and released to capitalize on all the 2012 Snow White hoopla. I also knew that this was going to be very much in the vein of my favorite SyFy Movies. While it is not going to be taking home any awards or making the critics top ten lists, IT IS A FUN MOVIE. Someone mentioned that its an escape film, and that's what it is, an escape. Yes, I will be the first to admit that I'm a purist when it comes to the presentation of my favorite fairy tale. The fact that Snow White is a blonde was a little off-putting. And something was up with the sound as I had to jack up the volume. However, it was nice to see an ""alternate"" take on the story. The elves were pretty cool and the romance between Snow White and Prince Alexander was sweet. The guy just can't give up!! To conclude folks, if you enjoy the delightful crap the SyFy Channel puts on every weekend, or you just want a break, then give this film a chance. I'm glad I did!!"
4,TROUBLE SHOOTING YOUR PC FOR DUMMIES,"IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND DECIDE TO DO THINGS ON YOUR PC IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU NEED A COPY OF THIS BOOK WHEN YOU GET STUCK. AND YOU WILL. UNLESS YOUR AN EXPERT, THIS BOOK WILL STEER YOU IN THE DIRECTION AND STEPS YOU NEED TO KEEP FROM BUYING A NEWW PC AFTER YOU TAKE A HAMMER TO THE ONE YOUR TRYING TO FIX. I ALWAYS TRY TO GET AS MANY MANUALS FOR WHAT I AM WORKING ON, EVEN CARS. THE WORLD KEEPS CHANGING AND WE NEED HELP TO KEEP UP/ THE BOOK IS INFORMATIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, NOT LIKE A TECH MANUAL."
1,Ap Spanish,The book that i had rcieved is usless for my class. It is incorrect to be selling USED WORKBOOKS. This takes off the work of students trying to learn.
5,Amazing and Brave!,"I had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Higgins many times during the time that he was writting this book. He was one amazing, brave and loving man. He told me many personal stories of his life and shed many tears. It was heartbreaking to see the hurt in his eyes on reliving the pain from so many years ago. I have read this book several times and feel his pain. Thank God for men like him!"
1,Chatter,I was in the same POW camp a bit longer than Higgins. I recall most of the incidents and have written my own story. The chatter and conversations probably did not occur and certainly could not have been remembered when the book was written. It was probably written in to make the story more interesting. I have been back three times and as recently as less than one year ago. Now a beautiful youth camp.
5,Another great album,"It's too bad this album doesn't get more airplay, it's definately worth listening to...."
4,Michael Peterson's sophomore album doesn't disappoint,"Michael Peterson's sophomore album Being Human is an excellent showcase of his talent as a singer and a writer. His sincerity comes through loud and clear, since he writes and sings the songs himself. This album is not ""more of the same"". He is proving his development as an artist, and provides some great music in this collection. His performance is strong on the upbeat songs as well as the ballads. The strongest tune is Slow Dance, with his duet, Two of the Lucky Ones, running a close second. His delivery is convincing and evokes emotion. Michael has again proven his versatility, and increases interest for future offerings. The musicians are excellent and constitute an integral part of this work. There is a comforting familiarity to Michael's voice that makes him seem like a good friend. By Lauren"
2,No verdict yet,"I bought this to Hot Sync with a second PC. I haven't been able to get it to work yet. Have tried everything. My USB cradle worked with the unit and my PC with Windows XP, so I'm thinking it's something with the cable. Waiting to here from somebody else on the issue. I believe there's a misprint in the users manual about selecting ""Direct Serial"" connection. That's not even an option in the Hot Sync Manager. I have it set to ""Cradle/Cable."""
5,dollar sign charm,"Beutiful necklace for a good price. Fragile though, this is my second one, but I do have a 3 year old with a habit of tugging."
2,Good story doesn't overcome poor writing.,"Although the plot is strong, the style of writing in this book is amamteur-ish and does not live up to the strong storyline.The action is stiff, the characters are one dimensional, and the the 'conversations' are painfully awkward. The excellent story line does not compensate for the poor writing."
3,Couldn't get through this one,"Easy writing style carried me half way through Fruit of A Poisonous Tree, but I found the plot laboring to find a conclusion. When they dived for the same items the second time in sequence, I lost my patience. I shouldn't have to work so hard to follow a plot. Sorry, but this one is not for me, and I love JAG on TV. Pick up the pace and keep the plot moving along at a faster pace and this author could be a best seller.I didn't care about the characters, lacked character development."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book because its description sounded promising and it got a lot of good reviews here. Man, was I disappointed: A clumsy, far-fetched story line, flat characters, a main character that is kind of a Stephanie Plum in uniform, a very uninspired and wooden writing style (how an intense and dangerous meeting between a number of military ships of different nations with a sting operation going down can be written like the minutes of a boring business meeting is beyond me) - and on top a plethora of spelling errors, typos and some such (with ""interruptor"" instead of ""interpreter"" being the only kind of amusing one).I understand that this is the author's debut (which is why I don't rate the book a one-star). But maybe his publisher should have provided a couple of good editors and proof-readers to support him - the way it actually happened, Harris was set up for failure."
1,Awful,"Poorly written, clumsily plotted, and pretty tedious. The characters are flat and stereotypical and the dialogue silly and overwrought. This is a slow-moving marathon trek through classic examples of bad writing. Attempts to be derivitive of better thrillers are obvious and fail. Set in the Northwest, it manages to suggest none of its beauty or atmosphere. A big disappointment for the price and a waste of time."
1,"bad writing, ok plot","I bought this book because of its high ratings by readers and because it appeared in several top 10 lists that included other authors l like. It wasn't obvious to me until I got the book that it was self-published. I still read it with an open mind because of the positive reviews, but it was painful to get through. Although the plot is fun in the abstract, the way the book progresses, the scenes, the dialogue and the descriptions of the locale are banal at best but often awkward. I've never written a review for amazon before, but I felt completely duped by all the exhuberant praise for this book and had to put my two cents in. Read Lee Child or Vince Flynn instead."
4,impressive,"i purchased this unit with hopes of experiencing the true essence of low frequency response.this item delivers it's expected purpose. i bought a 10-inch model three years ago. i was so impressed by this model,i use it with my home theater system . the 10inch model can produce low frequencies more accurately than most 12-15 models of other brands out there.this lead to my curiosity about a larger jbl sub unit .i've owned and used this unit for a year , it never dissapointed me.i hope your neighbors are nice people ,you'll be gettin lots of visits and calls from them, trust me. my only problem with this unit is it's size , it's huge and kind of awkward. placement of this unit is a very easy task, it fills the room with exceptional low end virtually anywhere you place it . without getting all technical,i hope this information is helpful."
4,A great Sub!,"I have two of these, and would not recomend buying more than one. If you want more bass than this one can put out I sugest you go with a bigger sub."
2,Buyer Beware,"This subwoofer sounds pretty good, and it certainly doesn't lack any punch, but...two things to consider before buying this subwoofer. One, it is HUGE- there will be no hiding this thing. Two, I had mine less than 3 months before it broke. it is still under warranty, but this thing is no picnic to load into the car and drive 50 miles to get fixed. I suggest before you buy, check JBL's website to see how close the closest service location is and clear out a BIG open space near your receiver."
5,Good case for the apple macbook air,"Good case - i bought it for the macbook air - it fits nicely inside - the case is pretty light and their is a good amount of storage for stuff like extra plug, mighty mouse, etc"
3,OK bag for the money,"I got this for my daughter's MacBook. The fit is very tight and the bag feels as though it is stretching to the breaking point. The pocket seems feel very flimsy, only time will tell if they will hold up. I have several Brenthaven bags of varying prices and quality and they all feel sturdier than this one.******* Update August 2009After almost a year this bag is still holding up well. It still feels 'cheap' but overall I'd say its a good value."
2,Not near as good as I thought before buying,"The image categories are arranged in 1000's of images,and the program only shows 6 at a time, so finding theright one may take hours. (plus they have no names)Adding custom text is font size, bold, italics, etc. only!No real formating of text.The border images print off the page, even though theywere well within the boundaries on the screen. (I havean Epson R200 printer, and xp home sp2)After installation, my windows xp theme was completelymessed up. The app changed it to xp blue, and other thingswere also changed. Plus it added about 50 useless fonts."
3,Well done but borrows from better films,"The gore flows and the Dutch scream in this European import. The fact that they rip off almost every vampire movie made after ""The Lost Boys"" is almost redeemed by a nicely paced screenplay and good effects."
4,Lead guitar extravaganza,Two of the best each with two amazing new songs just rock no other genres in there schemers anytime steals the show
3,The music is great.,"Burt Bacharach is truly a master and a genius when it comes to melody, harmony, and rhythm. Unfortunately, his genius does not extend to his understanding of current events or the challenges we face in this country or in the world. Some of the hate and anger-filled lyrics distract from what is otherwise a fabulous album. Better to leave the lyric-writing to Hal David."
3,A bit of a let down.,"I appreciate that a 78 year old artist, who I feel is one of the greatest song-smiths of the last century, so greatly cares about the direction of this nation, and the world in general to bring forth his first 'protest-album.'While songs of protest have been in his oeuvre for decades 'Windows of the World,' these songs don't feel fresh or new, many seem lifted from previous works.One highlight, Rufus Wainright's plaintiff vocals on 'Go Ask Shakespeare.'"
3,Sincerity Can't Save this One,"You gotta love burt, he is such a sensitive composer, you can always feel it in his melodies. Clearly, this is an important project for him, his twilight song, I suppose, where he laments a world he might be leaving soon, and one his children and people in general have to deal with. Needless to say, he has created some pretty music here ( Where did it go and In our time specifically), but in general, the project left me cold. To me, his music has turned into a generic formula, I've heard it before, in better albums like Woman. You can never question Burt's sincerity and the beauty of his musical landscapes, but on At this Time, it just isn't enough to give weight to what he is trying to do.p.s. get rid of elvis costello"
1,"It's 2005, not 1969","This record plays like one of those William Shatner singing rock records. It's pretty funny. I guess it's ol' Burt's attempt to regain relevance, and how better to get positive reviews by Rolling Stone, entertainment Weekly, etc. than to go after George Bush and the ill-fated Iraq war? The overly synthesizerization and trite lyrics make this a collector's item, certainly worth playing at your next bong party. Where was Bacharach in the 60s? Trying to find his way to San Jose."
5,"WOW, That's GREAT!!!","Style, Burt has a such beautiful magic and inspiration!!! THis album brings us a great moment of Burt bacharach, the Burt now! I have many albums of him, but this is so pleasant, so tasteful, It's a proof that TALENT don't die through the years. DELICIOUS!!!!!"
5,An amazing record,"What can I say. Burt Bacharach has produced the finest record of his career. A beautiful, heartfelt and incrediby melodious album that I can't stop playing. Please keep recording Burt. Your music is timeless and we the world needs you now - more than ever. From Canberra Australia, I salute you Mr Bacharach."
5,The evolution of a musical Genious.,"At this time i can safely say is one the most fascinating cd i have ever heard.As an audiophile,iam mostly concern with arrangement,production and sound quality.Secondly,iam sensitive to the meaning and soul of each song.Truly there are some political conotation suggested by some of the lyrics but it is the musical genious that appeals to me.This cd highlights the evolution of one of greatest song writer and arranger of the last 30 years.The production is nothing short of breathtaking and sound quality using the lastest mastering technology namely DSD is an audiophile dream come true.This may be the final chapter in Mr.Bacharachs legacy so for the historical value along with the arrangement this cd is highly recommended and is worth getting."
5,Dinah smooth-easy-lush-a wonderful album,I have been collecting great singers cd's for a couple of years now. Some like Dinah I first heard as child on the radio and Nat King Cole on televison. You get so in your youth that they were just there and franky I did not appreciate how good they were. These tracks were mostly recorded just before I was born in 1944. I bought the album out of a sense of completness. This one is perhaps my favorite and most played. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I tried this stuff on three different attempts, each attempt was its own two-week period, this all being on a single and very average size wart. I even trimmed it down first to ""increase the freeze depth"" like someone else mentioned. (who must work for DR Scholl based on the length of their praise for the product). I also held the applicator on for ridiculously long periods, and it never took the wart off. Nobody wants to pay 30 bucks for something that takes two weeks to figure out that it didn't work. I had two other warts in the past, and I'm going back to what does work....COMPOUND W. Its even way cheaper, and takes the same time period. Let me ask you this?....if you're not alergic to salicylic acid, and freezing takes just as long for the desired effect (for the few it works on), and compound W is cheaper, then why would you ever buy this? Trust me folks...its just not worth it."
4,Works for most dummies,"I don't typically write reviews but I had to since I see so many people write that it doesn't work for them. My 6 year old had 3 small size warts on his foot and I used 2 treatments on each wart just to make sure they went away. The key thing about using the kit is that it suggest using the product for no more than 22-24 seconds (prob to keep people from hurting themselves), which might not be long enough to kill the Wart. So one must use a little judgement and keep the applicator on the Wart until the Wart turns white (without burning yourself). After a bath, I used the same applicator 2-3 times on the same wart and the Warts went away in 12 days. One of the warts didn't respond to the inital treatment, so I repeated the previous steps and it finally went away."
1,Stay away!!,"I had a couple of warts on my fingers. I tried Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away, as well as Dr. Scholl's liquid. It seemed to be doing something but the warts would stay on there. Very weak stuff. Get Compound W, it worked very very quickly for me and the warts never came back."
3,"Love the Gottmans, but DON'T like the way this is read","I love the Gottmans, have lots of their other titles, so I was really looking forward to having this to listen to in the car. The information is great - as expected - but I REALLY don't like the way this is read.I had hoped that the ACTUAL taped conversations of the real couples would have been used....the transcripts of the conversations are read however, and the result is a stilted, artificial, and mildly annoying rendition.I am interested enough in the material to listen on, but it's a disappointment."
3,Nice for Beginner - All Others - Find a Real Dulcimer,"First, this is more of a strum stick than a bona fide dulcimer.It will be hard to find music for a 6 stringer, but you can adapt the strings to a D-A-D configuration. You play this like a cheap guitar.Second, it should always be priced in the $30 range or less because it is inexpensive quality and mass produced so this advertisement about ""Blowout Sale - Today Only"" which has been going on for awhile really isn't true. It is not worth $90+ to begin with.Third, you will need a tuner because this strum stick comes untuned. It does come with a nice carrying case, extra string, and a pick.Conclusion: If you want to play an authentic 3-4 string dulcimer on your lap like the original musicians did and do, this is not the instrument for you."
1,Woops! I bought a cheapie.,"I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this one. I opened it up, tuned the strings and started playing. Some of the frets couldn't hold the strings and the bridge is a floating-style - not very durable for a traveler.I returned it the next day for a full refund (shipping at my expense). Spend a little extra dough and get a better guitar. This one is not even good enough for a toy."
3,Okay,It was okay. I thought it would talk about a particular place that was affected by the flood but it covered many places.
2,Not worth the wait!,"Well, I finally tried this after wanting to for years. It sure wasn't worth the wait! Like other reviewers on various perfume sites, I didn't think the tuberose note really stood out. The scent itself faded very quickly. It was gone is less than 15 minutes! I don't hate this by any means but, it wasn't me. The search for a Creed I'm in love with continues..."
2,Tubereuse ... Nothing special,"I SO wanted this to work, and I received a generous sample from Saks to try ... enough for a week! (Yes, generous. Thank you counter gal.)After a week, I decided that Indiana is an average, run-of-the-mill, old-fashioned floral. I imagine it being something that my Grandmother might have worn in the 50s, 60s & 70s ... Strong, floral, feminine.It's just not me. I'll take the florals but I want something more complex, more different, more modern. Tubereuse ... What's all the fuss?"
4,ecstatic language meets wilds imagination,"I will be quick. She has, here, made language hers. It is too little to say that this book is ""good."" To see where her mind travels and the lyrical language she uses to express that place have left me breathless as I read and reread her work. Truly, unless you have already imagined the day the whale landed on the streets of Manhattan, you have not imagined enough."
5,#1480 Whiteside Machine: the best bits...,"If you've used Whiteside bits, you know what you're getting: exceptional quality for years of use and sharpening. This is my second oval-edge profile bit, the 1480 is the largest capacity and perfect for 1"" to 1.5"" stair tread and bullnose applications for use in a router table.My only [minor] nit is Whiteside doesn't include a box or container for protective storage...not a big deal."
3,For the collector,"I got this because i love Iron Maiden and wanted to get their version of ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" (one of the greatest of all Iron Maiden songs). It's good, but if you don't love Iron Maiden it's not really worth getting just for this. You do also get a cover of mettallica's ""Battery"" which is solid also. The DVD has a number of videos, some live footage, and some footage of the filming of the videos and the album.Get this if you really want the extras, otherwise, stick with the regular album which is absolutely fantastic. I'm really rating the bonus features here, the album is 5 stars."
2,R U Kidding? The new Fozzy CD/DVD destroys this,"I agree with the reviews....so incredibly overated....sounds just like 'More things Change'........far too predictable at this point with the changes and the 'spooky sounds' that go to the heavy parts......I should have bought the Fozzy CD sooner, which by the way, is amazing....."
2,"Heavy..., but boring","I had read all about Machine Head's ""The Blackening"" album as a ""return to their thrashing ways..."", so I went out and bought it. Boy, was I disappointed! While the album is indeed heavy metal, it's just dull, with very few interesting guitars and vocals that just bore the heck out of me. I loved Robb's old Vio-lence stuff, and was hoping for more (maybe that's my own fault).While I don't discourage others from getting this album, it won't be in my collection. Already traded it in... Sorry."
2,Still Nu-Metal,"If you got hooked onto Machinehead with either Burn My Eyes or The More Things Change, then is not the album for you. It is a vast improvement over the middle part of their career, but still lacks the edge they had in the beginning. I could only listen to the album twice before it was put on the shelf forever, never to be played again. Through the Ashes is better than this album ever had the potential to be, but even that was lacking in writing and production. The only way Machinehead will become the metal tyrant like the days of old is to get Logan Mader back on lead and reapply the thrash/hardcore stylings again."
2,Over-rated,"I bought the last Machine Head album and I ended up selling it because it just wasn't good.Then the Blackening came out and I heard some of it at my local guitar shop and the guys were saying ""this is the best CD ever"". Then I read somewhere that this is ""The best metal album of all time"". So naturally I had to get myself a copy.All I can say is this album is NOT the best metal album ever. It's very typical and generic all the way through. There are some shinning moments, but don't run out to buy it, it's not worth the hype.The first song, Halo, and Wolves are pretty good songs. The rest of the album is the definition of mediocrity. Bottom line, there's nothing new here."
4,Great Metal CD....remover the hype and enjoy,"The most Hyped CD of the last 5-10 years...good for them. After being ignored by the label and blatantly mistreated, it's nice to see the label generated a mountain of great press to get back on the band's good side. Forget the hype, it is what it is...a record that from start to finish is pretty hard to beat.......couldn't believe somebody mentioned Fozzy? Not even the same style of music, really....but I have to agree that Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded CD is incredible! Just don't really think we should compare the 2 bands. (but check it out! you won't believe how good y2J the wrestler can sing)"
3,Pretty good metal LP,"The Blackening has a few strong memorable riffs. The drumming is creative and the whole band is very solid technically. The singer is not great, although this record sounds better than other Machine Head records I've heard. Overall, a decent record that's good for a few spins but doesn't really leave a lasting impression."
2,"It is no ""Burn My Eyes""","I get a kick out of the people claiming this is as good as ""Burn My Eyes"". Have they even heard that album? I bought BME new, and have all their albums. This is no ""Burn My Eyes"", in fact, the last album was way better. If you love the whiny, tempo-killing singing, poorly placed solos, overly long acoustic intros, and the songs about Rob's feelings, which have been the ruin of Machine Head in the last few albums, buy this album. If you were expecting a return to their thrash roots as the Nu-metal fans above suggest, look elsewhere. You will be sorely disappointed as I was. Most overhyped album of the year? Indeed."
2,The solo are great but...,"If you want to hear through the ashes... with great solo guitar you should get this album, but what makes this album get 2 star from me is after the song title ""now i lay thee down"" you only get song that sound sooo nu metal, yes i only like the first three song from this album, man this album is dissapointing me"
1,YEah!,"Yes, another trend band! Wo hoo, now we can add them to such great classic scenester groups as Papa Roach, Green Day, Devildriver and other such money-grubbing scum! If you want a band that went from playing fake, watered down thrash to vapid nu-metal and then talentless trendy metalcore, look no further!Recommended to fans of Trivium, Hellyeah, Atreyu, and other such great, talented bands!"
1,piece of s***,"this is by far one of the worst heavy metal albums i have heard comeout in the last year, no wait five years, no better make that ten years. way overated band who suck live. the only band they played after was gojira who are from france. and even they sounded better."
3,"OK sound, not shielded for CRT monitors","I got these speakers to replace an older set that failed. The sound quality is OK for the price. The power supply is in the right speaker, there is no external power brick, and the AC cord goes straight into the speaker. I have a traditional CRT monitor, not the LCD flat panel, and the power supply in the right speaker generates enough of a magnetic field to interfere with the CRT display, causing distortion. I swapped the speakers with my other computer, which has a flat panel LCD monitor and they work fine. Don't get these if you use a CRT and want to place the speakers within 12 inches of the monitor."
3,decent value,"Not the finest speaker available, but a good value. It does an acceptable job with our computer. We use other means for fine listening."
4,The Pig sticks it out til the end,"Most reviewers prefer the early to middle books in the Freddy series, but this isn't one of later ones to pass up.At this point, author Brooks was in poor health. Obviously thinking he might not be able to finish another, he ""wraps the series up"", finally disposing of two villains, and telling what happens to Freddy years later. (Long after the series actually ended.)Many of the best characters are back, and the reader is left wondering for a good long time how it is that Freddy would EVER crown his old enemy, Simon the rat.Wiese's illustration detail seems to vary depending on how intersted he is in the book -- he's obviously interested in this one. Wiki has plot summary and publication history."
5,Bratz AND Girl Talk...COOL!,Although I have not actually bought this game I have the original Girl Talk game. My freinds and I have had fun on my parties playing this game. It is very durable which is good because sometimes my friends get crazy. I like Bratz and I like truth or dare and I like Girl Talk. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone intrested in a fun and challenging truth or dare game.(especially for Bratz fans like me!)
2,A failure to improve on their previous album,"The hype in alternative circles surrounded this record before its release this past summer. The ""Next Nirvana"" and ""Southern Fried Nirvana"" labels were being generously tossed around when describing this record. On the strength of the previous record, ""Souls For Sale"", this hype seemed perfectly logical. The truth, actually, is that ""Into the Pink"" is not even as good as that record.The songs on this record, save for the excellent voice and piano opener ""Lovely Isn't Love"", are unremarkable and seemingly half-finished. The performances seem half-hearted as well, as if the band recorded this album in a haze of alcohol and narcotics, which is entirely possible. Dave Grohl's production, like on his own records, is pedestrian, not helping the cause at all.So, check out ""Souls"", avoid this record and hope the next record marks a return to previous form."
2,junkie rock?,"I sometimes forget how important humor is in making good music, until I hit a record that is pretty much devoid of it. The musics OK but the band (especially the guy) takes itself way too seriously and thats a big turnoff. The band doesn't really live up to its indie hype because they fail to be anythiing but derivative (the singer can't decide if he wants to sound like Nirvana or Radiohead - as opposed to just developing his own style)... plus listening to heroin glorification makes me sick."
3,"Easy There, Feller","This is at worst a tolerable record. But it certainly doesn't warrant the foaming at the mouth that's dripped out in so many five star reviews. Don't get me wrong. The record has its moments. But in an unlikely turn, it's the plaintiff rather than caustic tracks of the record that keep its head above water. Which is quite disappointing when you consider the vibrant, infectious energy of ""Souls for Sale.""Finally, Dave Grohl is a really great drummer. Enough said."
2,"Skip this, get ""Souls for Sale""","I picked up this album after listening to the incredible ""Souls for Sale album"" I couldn't be more dissapointed. It's almost shocking to hear how bad this album is after listening to Souls for Sale. The great boy/girl harmony, guitar driven rock is gone.Instead it's all synth and studio editing. This album is over-produced and under-performed. At times it sounds as slick as a Garbage album. This isn't what I expected from Verbena. Sometimes the unexpected is good, but this time it's an unwelcome departure."
3,Into the Verbena,"I think Verbena make good music,but on this album is not so evident.Their debut,""Souls for sale"",was more various and emotional,two things that ""Into the pink"" have not.However,the riffs are interesting,and it's not too easy to forget their songs.The first seven songs are fantastic,but the end of the album sounds like the same thing on the track 9,track 10 etc etc. The high points are the intro song,Lovely isn't love,Baby Got Shot(nice video!),John Beverly and Monkey i'm your man.The other songs are too ripetitive and soul-less.4 stars for the first part of the album,1 star for the end-"
3,not as you might expect,"This is a CD of arrangements for guitar of early Mozart pieces. The booklet is quite uninformative about the pieces, other than listing their names and K. numbers. The booklet contains no description of when or how Mozart wrote these early pieces. I had expected mostly piano music, so the guitar came as quite a surprise."
2,My opinion is perhaps too much influenced,"by having had to read this book at the age of 14 for a college class I didn't actually want to be taking.Technically, I suppose the writing is excellent. I still remember scenes from the book, and I'm 58 now. The characters were, mostly, realistic - but some of the scenes I remember make it look to me like the man didn't actually have much use for sex.And I have known more than enough gay men and lesbians - and several transpeople, for what little that may be worth - to know that pedophilia is a base canard. But the notion that gays and lesbians are routinely attracted to children was used in this book.Only one of the characters seemed to be a consistently nice person, which is not particularly realistic considering the number of major and secondary characters there are - two or three would have been much more believable."
5,A Touch of Class,"What a delight to listen a CD that covers the high class artists who shaped the Las Vegas Showcases. Great to hear legendary Capitol recording stars s.a. Bobby Darin, Mel Torme, Al Martino, Peggy Lee, Keely Smith and the great harmony and outstanding music of Sandler & Young. Too bad there are not that much CD's available. This album is highly recommended.A 5 star CD!!"
3,Decent hard rock,"Ha! I remember The Godz! A friend of mine had this album and we used to bug another friend (big Genesis fan) by playing Gotta Keep a Runnin'. The song has this goofy singing part: ""The Gods are Rock and Roll Machines"" It annoyed him to no end.There are only a few standout/memorable songs; the aforementioned track, Under the Table, and Candy's Going Bad. Fairly strong hard rock, but nothing unusual or special."
4,bought for nostalgia maybe; but I still really like it!,"I got this via Amazon UK. It's well worth it if you owned the original vinyl LP as I did and IF you liked it.I'm a mid-western guy and this music appealed to the KISS Army in me.""Under the Table"", ""Cross Country"" and the great cover of Golden Earring's ""Candy's Going Bad"" are 3 classic hard rock tracks.""Side one"" isn't bad either....I haven't heard the ""bonus tracks"" yet. I am on my 2nd spin thru the first album.---okay I put 'Luv Kage' on...I Like It! Very KISS-like.I never expected to see the Godz on compact disc. I don't know what someone at Black Rose Records in Germany is thinking but I am happy he gave a green light to put the Godz 1st album and most of the 2nd (which I only have on cassette) on disc.The transfer isn't perfect but geez my Casablanca copy was no gold disc either.Power Rock from USA Indeed. Rockers don't ignore this classic slice of Hard Road Rock'n'Roll!"
5,rockin!!!!!!,"the godz are a great band. they not only focus on their lyrics, but they also have the great ability to move you with their music. my fiance bought it. he played it for me. wow!!!! i think myself they sound like acdc. our cd got scatched up pretty bad in the "" dry county "". so i am going to purchase a new one for my honey for fathers day. he will love it.. great band!!!!!!!"
4,Memories Of My past,"I Bought The Album(record, not CD)After My Little brother Kept Ranting And Raving About This New Band, He Had Heard On A Radio Station Out Of San Antonio.A Station He Could Get if The weather Was Good.Gotta Keep A Runnin Was The Song The Station Was Playing.If For No Other Reason, Buy This CD for That Song. If You Grew Up In The Last Days Of ""Acid Rock"" As I Did, Gotta Keep A Runnin will Strike A Nerve And Bring The memories Back.On A Whole,The Entire Album Is Very Good. My Brother And I Still Enjoy It Today."
5,Great Rock n' Roll,The Godz had to be seen live to be fully comprehended. The studio album output only scratches at the surface of what is was like to see The Godz brand of molten high intensity rock n' roll. I truly miss this kind of fun and intensity.This CD unfortunately is an import (potential boot)and I'm not sure how much (if any) royalties that Eric Moore and Chatfield see from this.A great album from one of the underrated great rock bands.
5,ROCK N ROLL MACHINES,"When I first walked into the Newport in Columbus, Ohio in 1977 to See this act I was Sceptical, to say the least. What good thing ever came out of Columbus, Ohio ('cept Dwight Yoakum I guess). Let me tell you I left with my head shaking. This was the finest display of Raw hard-driving rock n roll I'd experienced since seeing THE MC5 in Detroit's Grande Ball room more han 10 years before. If you want to ""rock yer sox off"" get this CD ( I have the album framed on the wall next to It's A Beautiful Day's White Bird Album) turn up the volume to full, the slides on the EQ to full, Put the speakers 5 feet apart facing each other take two shots of tequila sit between the speakers and hit play. You will be pleasantly surprized. Really"
5,Fascinating and thought provoking.,"Dr. Yang's scientific training is on full display in this DVD where he provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of chi/qi and gives his very well-considered theories on how chi functions from a western scientific perspective. His discussions of electric conductance and the various tissues of the body is fascinating, though those without a scientific background may have to work some to understand things like Ohm's Law, etc. His discussion of bones and the secondary meridians was very useful and not something that I have seen so thoroughly explored in many other qigong works.I hesitated for some time to purchase this introductory DVD simply because is was, well, introductory. But it turned out to be an excellent purchase."
1,"Poor logic, unorganized.","He may have a point, but he won't get to it any time soon. I've been watching the lecture for an hour and there is not a single idea that follows through. New concepts are introduced without any relation to main topic. Language and expression becomes a real barrier in understanding the topic and I speak Chinese."
5,Perfect,"I thought this was the best purchase I have made off of Amazon. You will have read all the other, more detailed, responses so I won't repeat what's been said.-But, this: Get it."
1,"Seinfeld is unfunny,pointless, and a waste of time",Seinfeld is a real pointless TV show that somehow made audiences laugh but this is one unfunny and annoyning TV show that dosen't deserve this DVD set(The Simpsons is the best cartoon TV show ever and dosen't get a box set of features and Seinfeld does).The series are pointless and have no sense or laughs. the show is a bunch of New Yorkers living life on misadventures and meeting weird people. Jerry Seinfeld is a terrible actor and a bad comedian and the rest of the cast are pathetic. Please watch something better on TV and skip Seinfeld. Please don't waste money on this box set it is a waste of time. For fans of this so-called show why waste 54 dollars on this box set when TBS shows it for free.
1,There idiots,You can buy the First 2 volumes for about $60.00 why would you pay an extra $ 20.00 for worthless crap the only thing that counts is the episodes.I can understand if there are like 5 lost episodes but you are better off to buy the DVD.The Show is one of the best shows of all time but this is a rip off.The Rip off Store called and there running out of you
1,Deaf & Hearing Impaired Beware,"If you are Deaf or Hearing Impaired, and depend on Closed Captioning to enjoy DVDs, you can count the Seinfeld gifts sets among the many other rip offs. The episodes are Closed Captioned, but the Extras and Commentaries by the actors, etc., are not....as usual. Too bad they spent all that money on salt/pepper shakers and playing cards and once again ripped off the Heairng Impaired. We can enjoy the episodes, but nothing else."
5,ERROR IN WHAT COMES WITH BOX SET,just wanted to mention that along with the salt and paper shakers you recieve a Monk's metal napkin dispencer.If you do not believe me go to seinfeld.com and go to about the DVD under gift set and it mentions the metal napkin dispencer.
5,Setting a New Standard,"Confirmed by it's huge popularity, Seinfeld took TV Comedy to a new level with truly creative plot lines coupled with likeably imperfect characters sporting delightful personality flaws.With the release of this set, Seinfeld brings the world of TV DVDs to a new level as well - Will the world ever accept a DVD collection to be packaged without Salt and Pepper Shakers again????"
5,I grew up on this show,I was only three years old when Seinfield first aired and I used to watch it when i was around 7. I would watch the new episodes every week and was sad when the show ended. But with the introduction of the DVD box set I can watch all of Seinfield whenever i want and not just reruns. Best decesion every to come out with Seinfield on Box Set. Laugh out loud comedy all the way.
1,"Consider other viewpoints, and the facts.","As a devout, conservative Christian, I encourage others to come to their faith (and strengthen their faith) through historical, archeological and other scientific means. I will not tell anyone, Jew or non-Jew to read or not to read anything. What I will advise is to consider more than one perspective on the Jew vs. Jesus question. If you want to strengthen your ""Jesus was not the Messiah"" viewpoint or your ""Jesus was only a prophet"" viewpoint, their is plenty of one-sided reading material out there to support it. I would, however, for the sake of your eternal salvation recommend you read at least three books before securing your viewpoint: 1) The entire New Testament (focusing on the fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies), 2) Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Christ,"" and 3) Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Faith. For those of you who are non-Jew or non-Christian, I recomment Ravi Zacharrias' (sp?) ""Jesus Among other Gods. God's peace be with you."
1,obvious threat,"tooo bad! For a culture that would want to enlighten, it is obvious the mind of this writer is closed with hate and the threat that there may be more than his opinion in the universe. The spread of anti-semitism is only accerated with hate messages guised in ""hilarious anti-christian"" jokes. ""Anti"" should be the last endeavor of our people. Pro peace for Israel in not an anti pledge. How will the Jews win respect with an anti attitude. The essence of Holocaust is anti. Why stoop to the same level? Be pro God, anti sin."
4,my Conservative rabbi had all the teenagers he taught read this book growing up,"While written by an Orthodox rabbi, this book is relevant to all Jews.The truth for Jews all over the world (even in Israel!) is, you or your children will be approached by missionaries, in the workplace, at college, at the park, on your doorstep. If you want to immunize yourselves and your children, you need to have intellectually honest and rigorous answers. This book really helps you do that.There is another book that I'd read alongside this volume to be more thorough and address more of the tactics currently used by missionaries. That's this bookTwenty-Six Reasons Why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus. It's available through Amazon and at many Jewish bookstores."
2,Kaplan achieved his goal,"First of all, I think the R. Kaplan's work is exactly what you would expect from an Orthodox rabbi and is exactly what R. Kaplan intended for his obvious goal...to educate the unobservant Jew who has already made up his mind on the issue in the Orthodox perspective on Jesus. Second, I only gave it 2 stars because it's far from his best work (which I would contend is on Kabbalism) but I guess it suits his goals. In all seriousness, this book really isn't going to convince anyone who is neutral on the issue either way but if your interested in the issue it's a decent place to start from.Just be warned...everyone is biased...Christian, Jew, Muslim, athiest, agnositic...and you only really learn about any issue be it scientific, political, or religious from hearing both sides....which leads to so much more productive and respectful dialogue than what I'm seeing with most of these reviews."
2,To the Last Post,"To whom this may concern,I read the last comments about this book, ""The Real Messiah."" I was interested in the book until the last guy spoke of a part in which the writer explains that Jesus incited his followers to kill his enemies. After that, this lost all credibility with me. Read the entire chapter of Luke 19:27 and you will see that Jesus was speaking in parable. Now, I'm not a bible thumber, but I did read the entire chapter to make certain that it wasn't taken out of context and to confirm my suspicions, it was. I'll probably still read the book, though, because it will, no doubt, be a fun read, and maybe I'll learn something. If you want to read a better source on the reality of Christ as the True Messiah, pick up ""Jesus the Christ"" by James Talmage. Now, don't take this the wrong way, because I'm not suggesting anything, but if you're a mediocre reader, like myself, make sure you have a dictionary handy for this book. Best to you."
5,"Simple, Easy, and Basic","This book provides a person with all the basics needed for those popular Thai dishes such as Pad Thai and the curry based dishes. The book also provides pictures of the ingredients to be used for each recipe, which is extremely helpful when you're not sure if you're using the right ingredients. The directions are simple to follow. I'm Thai, and I found this book very helpful in learning how to prepare foods I miss from home."
2,Just a Bunch of Needles,"I got these because I needed different sized tapestry needles to make furniture for my daughter's fashion dolls. I was happy because I was going to get assorted sizes and have all that I needed. Problem: There aren't any specifics with this product. I have no idea which needle is which size. So, I basically just wasted my money on something I may never use."
3,Whateva...,"Obviously not very believable-looking, I bought it as a part of a jokey costume. The mohawk stays in place, and it really looks just like the pictures. Smells really latex-y, though, and feels weird on the hair."
5,Learn to Love Leviticus,"I mentioned to a pastor friend of mine that I was doing my daily devotions in the Book of Leviticus. As would be expected from one of the uninitiated, I got a look that said ""you've got to be kidding.""People are under the mistake belief that because we are ""no longer under the law,"" the Old Testament is no longer relevant to our daily lives as Christians. This is where Gordon Wenham's book comes in.Wenham's commentary has opened this otherwise ponderous book in a way that I never dreamed imaginable. Truly all scripture is profitable!Wenham has a way of extracting the spiritual nugget out of the law that is applicable to us. While we do not earn our salvation, nor could we ever do anything to merit Eternal Life, G-d is still a holy G-d, and it is written in both Old and New Testaments ""Be ye holy, for I am holy.""Read Leviticus, by Gordon Wenham and see how this all fits into the big picture of ""Christ in you, the hope of glory."""
5,Be Ye Holy for God is Holy,"Excellent! This is a good resource by an astute Old Testament Scholar. At the end of each biblical chapter there is a New Testament discussion in how the passages could apply for the Church or Christians. Also, it starts with a great Theological Introduction of the Book of Leviticus. Although I'm an advocate of Eternal Security, I am not offended by the inspiration to live Holy. Grace Produces Holiness and Godliness"
5,Good looking side steps,"The picture does not do justice to how sharp these side steps look on my Cruiser FJ, the aluminum inserts really make them stand out. They were very easy to install, all of the holes lined up and it took about 15 minutes to install both sides. I am very pleased with these side steps and highly recommend them."
2,"It's cute, but cheap.","The largest stone fell out of mine shortly after receiving it. It's really cute, but not without all the stones."
3,Used,No problem or complaint.... I expected what I got. Just happy to have any Ross Thomas books.He's a great writer.
5,Would Love Another Copy,"I bought a used copy of Quakers & Nazis at a fundraiser. It only cost a dollar. It was one of the best dollars I've ever spent. I was a fairly decent history student in school, but I learned something new from every chapter of this book. It is truly an amazing read. Unfortunately, I took it along to a testing venue where no books were allowed beyond a certain point. I had only paid a dollar for the book. I assumed the topic would be deemed too boring or obscure by most people and no one would pick it up. Well, when my test was done, the book was gone. I hope who ever mistook it for homeless enjoys it as much as I did."
4,second set ...first one got lost in a move,When using my first set I lived in NY and my hair was always long. The caruso curls were wonderful without hair breakage /intence heat or sitting under an old fashioned dryer. In remembering how much I loved them I bought another set. I live in Florida now and the reason I'm not getting the same results I'm sure is that the humidity down here is off the wall. On low humidity days or just plain normal weather you can't beat the curl. I like the ability to create the type or kind of cure I'm in the mood for.On humid days I leave the curler on steam for a shorter time and use large hair clips instead of the carouso jacket.
4,"effective, efficient, easy","For me, curling irons are unwieldy for all over hair setting and electric curling rods are too heavy causing them to unwind or fall out of my hair.This is my second Caruso Steam Hairsetter, the first one being lost in a move. I like the effect I get with this quick hair setting aid.My only negative would be that sometimes the curlers slide out of my hair."
2,its alright......,"I really did a lot of research on rollers and these were so highly rated that I finally bit the bullet and bought a set. I have thin fine medium to long length hair. The only plus to these is they don't damage your hair. They do curl my hair and stay in with no products for about 6 hrs but I don't like the way it curls. To make my hair stay on the roller I have to wrap it tighter which means the different size rollers become pointless. And I'm looking for volume not all over curl(which is what it gave me). Also if left on the steamer to long it will cause my hair to go frizzy. And I have 4 little kids and trying to make sure I time all the rollers while dealing with kids in the morning is distracting. My last complaint is the roller clips if you can call them that. I fight about half of them to stay in and they cause a line where they are put in at. So all in all I'm not a fan. I hate that I bought these and will never use them again and stuck with them, but lesson learned..."
3,Curls aren't tight and don't last,"I'm used to using heated rollers, and I thought I'd try this steam set. I was excited after reading the reviews from other people, but after trying it once, I'm pretty disappointed. This takes longer to use than my Conair Xtreme set, and the resulting curls aren't nearly as bouncy and don't last as long. I'll try it again later, but I'm fairly disappointed with the results so far."
2,They Don't Make Them Like They Used To...,"My old ""purple"" system died after 15 years of use. I was excited to try out the ""new, no salt"" system. I ordered it in January, and the system has already quit working. I'm having to find alternative ways to curl my hair and am not happy. I'm also not willing to fork out another $35 on something that may/may not work."
5,Caruso Steam Hairsetter,"I bought my first Caruso Steam Hairsetter about 15or 16 years ago. The foam on the curlers was in bad shape. I was excited to find the updated one on Amazon.con. Obviously, I like it. The new stam system is much better than the one on my original set. There is no hot water to deal with when cleaning the system after use."
5,What would I do without this!,"I order 1 - 2 of these a year.The steam unit is the thing that usually goes 1 - 2 times a year, but it is 100% worth it for the results. Everyone always comments how nice my hair is when I use these rollers. Bit hit with the menfolk ladies!"
4,curler,"Works well, but not as well as other reviews would have you think. Is a little longer lasting than curling iron/hairspray combo. My hair is very straight on its own and curl holds but takes about 15-20 minutes to set, even with using hairdryer to speed it up. Would recommend this product. I also have had other brands hot rollers and this does work better than any of those i've tried."
5,A Good Investment,These came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. They offer a quick way to curl and the steam also gives my hair what I consider a spa treatment.Depending on the length of your hair you may need to order an extra set of rollers.signed a very pleased customer Kerry (sister locked and loving it)
1,Not for me!,"I did as much research as possible before purchasing these rollers. I have long, fine-length hair and I've never found a set of rollers that work...including these. They absolutely did NOT hold the curl all day. In addition, I found them difficult to roll as the centers are spongy; some were tighter than others regardless of how hard I tried to get them to be the same. Also, as others noted, only after three uses, the rollers had considerable indentions. The only good thing about these rollers was that I didn't notice much of a mark from the clips! These are definitely not for me!"
3,not working for me,"i bought this to replace my babyliss heated rollers, but after few uses i went back to my babyliss.the good things about this product is that it heats up really fast, and since it uses steam, it does not damage your hair.however, the result does not last at all. i'd leave the rollers on for about 15 min.,and my hair would get really curly, but the curls would be gone in about couple of hours. the product informacial stated that the curls would last for days, and could only be released by water. i found that part misleading."
5,"Works on thick, straight hair! LOVE THIS!","I love this product so much! I've been using these since they first came out like 20 years ago. I have super thick, straight, coarse hair and it curls like crazy with these! If I curl my hair with a curling iron, it takes forever and won't last an hour. These curls last all day!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"Just love this steam hair setter!! Have used them for many years, does not dry my hair out nor cause split ends.Way fast for fixing hair style to start your day. Try it, you won't be sorry!"
5,"""wet""/steam rollers","have had these for years! When I found out they ""closed"" shop, bought all that I could find..they do not damage hair, and it's set in 5 minutes (I have hair 5 inches longer than shoulders)Highly recommend it"
5,Caruso hairsetter,Excellent; Doesnt damage hair - used it for 20 years. Needs replacing about every 18-24 months- best money I ever spent.Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter
2,"no salt, no curl","I have been a caruso hair setter fan for years and years. I was always told when my hair was set that I had a Marylin Monroe hairdo. I bought my hair setter eventually after years of use finally conked out. I felt though it was an expensive setter, I got my moneys worth. I bought another caruso setter just over a year ago and it burned out and was almost shocked.I did use it with salt and tried it without and the curls did not last. I just had to buy two more setters as they also come with multiple size rollers and I don't use the jumbo at all. I am still using salt and am worried these two will also be out of commision in no time. I wish this company would go back to the old style."
1,Caruso Hairsetters have problems,"The Caruso hairsetters are absoulutley wonderful for holding curls in thedifficult-to-curl hair. There is only one major problem. After owning 5 of these products in the past 8 years, I am getting ready to purchase another one. (You would think that I would learn by now, but it's the only thing that keeps my hair curly.) These hairsetters quit working for no apparent reason. You are guaranteed about 6-10 uses before it craps out on you.This last one, which was the expensive $55 ionic set was used 4 times before it stopped. I would like to hear from someone who knows what the problem is with these hairsetters. First I thought it was the tap water I was using, so I tried using spring water. Another thought I had with my last hairsetter, was that I turned off the unit after use, but forgot to drain the water from inside the container. I believe there is another company that makes steam hairsetters. Does anybody know if the're any good?"
2,Not the Same Quality of Previous Unit,"I had a Caruso steam hairsetter for probably over 15 years before the electrical cord developed a break and sparks flew. I was sad. Other hot rollers were heavy, fell out, left marks and fried my hair. So I bought this one. It is working, but no matter what level the water is at it sputters water out the top along with steam and at times gets the rollers too wet. I still use it, but I suspect the quality is not the same and don't know if it will last. Tips: Besides using purified water I also recommend buying some cheap small aligator clips from the dollar store to hold them on instead of the ones they give you. Theirs leave a crease."
3,Disappointed,"i read all the reviews, this was even recommended by my stylist...While I agree the curl lasts and it definitely gets rid of frizzies, I absolutely **cannot** keep this stupid things in my hair!! I roll up a section, put on the clampy thing and by the time I've reached for the next roller, it had just slid right off. It takes me twice as long to roll my hair because I have to futz with each roller many times. And if it doesn't roll right out, it slips and sort of hangs leaving a huge clamp line in the middle of the wave.I have shoulder length, fine hair - lots of hair, but it is very fine. I'm assuming that's why it doesn't work for me.Your mileage may vary."
5,Glorious Hair!,"The Caruso curling system is wonderful! i have thick, straight, brown hair that i dye every 6 weeks or so, and have blonde highlights. My hair stays curly or wavy, depending on how long i leave the curlers in, forever! also, i've been curling my hair every 2 days or so and feel good knowing that i'm not damaging my hair as much as if i was using a plain metal curling iron or even regular hot curlers. Caruso curlers makes my hair look amazing...!"
3,"Decent, but far from perfect","I have thick, naturally straight hair and had high hopes for the Caruso system because so many people have said that the curl will stay in your hair for days. The curl leaves my hair within a matter of hours. A curling iron is much more effective for holding a long-term curl. What I do like about this system is that it is much more versatile than a curling iron. It's easy to get loose, beachy waves for example. It also sets up very quickly and doesn't appear to damage hair the way a curling iron does. This probably would work very well for someone with fine hair."
1,Not as advertised,"Instead of 2 jumbo, 3 large, 4 medium, 3 small and 2 petite rollers I was sent a package with 5 jumbo, 4 medium, and 5 petite. The jumbo are way too big for my needs, so this is a problem. I guess I'll have to exchange the package and hope the second time around I get the product I thought I was buying."
2,Didn't work for me,"The package and all the rollers look great and the steamer is compact and easy to use. Sadly, it didn't work for me.The steamer heats up in 1 min as expected but the curls don't last. I have should-length, straight hair but after letting the rollers cool for 15-20 min, my curls only last for about 5 min. 15 min afterward and all the curls have already lost all their shapes. I also agree with the comments about the snap-in ""lids"" for the rollers creating creases. Would be better to use your own clips."
1,Disaster!!! Do NOT buy!,1. Color same for all clips making it extremely difficult to find the right size clip.2. Unit would not steam after 5 uses!3. Definitely a waste of money for me!
3,I love the curls I get with the Caruso Hairsetter,"I get really good results with these systems, they are easy to use and better for your hair than curling irons. However, I would use distilled water if you can remember to.I have had to buy a new unit every year, because they stop working. I think it's because of the residue tap water leaves behind inside the machine. I can't figure out how to open the thing to clean it so I just buy new ones. I also tried sending money with the enclosed orderform that comes with the set, so I could just order a new heating unit, but I got my check returned, saying they didn't have any in stock. That was frustrating, because I could have saved money, now I have a ton of rollers I don't need. You do get beautiful curls though!"
1,Its not dual voltage,"I ordered this because the description says ""dual voltage"". However when I received the product it was identical to the single voltage model I already own. The steamer itself and the instructions both say ""120"" Volts only."
5,Fantastic Hairsetter,I've been using Caruso Molecular Steam Hairsetters for years. Every so often (probably due to very hard water) the amoung of steam it produces is dimished and I need to replace the unit.This particular model is very compact and great for traveling as well as every day use.I keep the rollers in for less than a minute. The result is hair with body and shine.I LOVE this hairsetter!
5,Awesome Product,My hair has NEVER held curls. These Caruso Rollers are fabulous!!! I have tried lots of things in the past (putting hair spray all over the curls after styling)...I do not like hair spray so when I used the Caruso rollers the first time I just left my hair product free....I could NOT believe how well and long the curls stayed in my hair. Thank you so much:)
4,Work really well,The best thing about these rollers is the style stays! They are easy to use without causing any damage to the hair. Only thing is my hair is wavy and I need to straighten them before I can use the rollers. But still these do the job. Would definitely buy again!
1,Caruso curlers a BIG flop!,These curlers ara a joke! The original curlers (10 years ago) were great. These ones have cheap foam and all six of the petite rollers had no covers to go over them so they are completely useless. I am VERY disapointed.
3,Didn't work for me.,"These rollers work as described and are probably much better for hair than other types and curling irons, but it takes too long for hair to dry unless you have time to stand there with a blow dryer for 15 or so minutes. After leaving them in for 30 minutes my hair was still damp. I tried to cut back further on the time left on the steamer, but that didn't really help much. They are just way too time consuming for me."
3,Just ok,"I bought the steam rollers to try to get away from frying my hair with ""iron"" products.They do keep my hair soft and healthy looking.Even though you have to do one curler at a time, it only takes seconds for the curler to heat up. So that is not a problem.However the curls do not last more than a couple of hours. And that is indoors.Outdoors, if there is wind or any humidity...curls are gone almost instantly.The new model also shows 6 large and 6 jumbo rollers.But they are combining those rollers --calling them large/jumboSo you are going to get 12 very large rollers. These are all set to be put on Ebay, as I cannot use that many jumbo rollers.(This will be a good thing for someone with very long hair)I am going to now invest in an expensive styling mousse, to try to get these curls to hold better.Wish I had the great experience with this roller system as some of you have had."
4,"Soft, Bouncy Curls","The rollers heat up as fast as you can get your next chunk of hair ready, but I found that I really need to leave them in for 30-45 minutes to really keep the curl. My hair is very thick, so I'm sure that wouldn't be true for finer hair. Once they are set, the curls stay with no hair spray (I also have a perm) and my husband loves my hair!"
3,Better than regular hot rollers,"I have own a Caruso hot roller set since the mid 1990s. The older models used table salt to produce the steam. The new models do not use salt, you just plug it in and it's ready to go. I noticed my old model does exactly as it states, curl stays in until I wash it out. But the new model I purchased that is not true. It lasts longer than regular hot rollers but not as long as my old model."
4,"Works really Great, but.......","I have been using this system to curl my hair (which is otherwise straight) for years. The first steamer I had I bought in the early 90's and it lasted the longest - I used it for 4 years, and then stored it to use as a back up. I have had at least 4 or 5 since, and they have not been as hot, and have only lasted 6-9 months. I then use the back-up one for several months until I get around to buying another. The back-up one finally died last fall, and I bought a ""Professional"" which only lasted 6 months. I really wish they would last longer, and I wish the new ones would steam as hot as the first set I had. Now that I'm in a pinch until I get my next one, I'm using the ""steamer"" (for when my kids get sick) to heat the rollers.... necessity is the mother of invention."
1,Not for Straight Hair,"I had high expectation on this product after having read the reviews. Unfortunately, both my daughter's and my straight Asian hair did not hold the curls for even half day. I am very disappointed and will return the product. Amazon is great in honoring the return and taking care of the return shipping."
5,Luv it!,"My hairdresser suggested this, instead of using a curling iron. Quicker + less damage. The curls last longer too! Luv it!"
3,Described accurately but not long lasting curls.,"The wave lasted a couple days but the curls fell within a few hours, I'm going to keep trying smaller rollers. i have a lot of thin hair that is long (upper mid back length hair), it's layered....the jumbo rollers are almost worthless. I get a decent curl out of the large, medium gets too tight of a curl just out of the roller but it falls eventually. Im going to experiment more because I am looking for a less damaging ways to get long lasting curls."
3,Not like my other Caruso steamers,"This particular purchase was somewhat of a disappointment. I'm having to wait much too long between each curler. As it gets older this does happen, but this one is much too slow right now. I'll be writing to Caruso for a replacement."
3,These used to work really well.,"I purchased one of these hair setters years ago when they were first advertised on TV. My hair won't hold a curl for more than a few minutes, so I was willing to try anything. I loved it! My hair stayed curly until I washed it, and it made my hair really soft - not damaging at all.Well, I wore out the rollers years ago and threw it out. I wanted to curl my hair for Halloween, so I looked to see if they still made this system. Yay! I bought one and curled my hair. It stayed curly for about an hour. I don't know what's different about the new systems except that you no longer have to add salt to the water reservoir. Was it the salt that made the curl last? No idea..."
1,Caruso Steam Hairsetter,I did not like this product. The clips are not easy to attach and the curlers keep falling out. I get a tighter curl with my old stand-by curling iron.
3,curls don't last as long as my original set..,I had this set in the late 1980's...it required a pinch of salt in the water. This was an easy step. I am disappointed because my curls don't last half as long with this setter as with my original one. That set lasted 20 years and did a great job. It still works but felt like a new one would be hotter...Not true. I even have a body wave now and my curls still don't last...I am very disappointed..
2,not very impressed,"I have very fine long hair. I was hoping this product would give me a nice curl that would last all night. It took a ridiculous amount of time to even get all the curlers in my hair because you have to individually heat each one. I also ran out of the same size curler and had to use two random small ones in the front of my hair. It turned into a mess, and when I had fixed it so that I looked somewhat passable, the curls fell out in a couple hours. I had a barely wavy look that had taken me an extremely long amount of time to get. It wasn't worth it."
3,Missing parts,"I got this earlier than expected, so I was thrilled. I've had a Caruso system in the past and love the way it works and the way my stubborn-hard-to-curl-hair looks when I've used it! I'm taking a trip to a humid destination, and figured the Caruso would be the best way I would have of looking good for daytime meetings and gala evening events.But when I opened it, I found that some of the rollers were missing ... specifically, the 6 petite were just not anywhere in the package. So - I will still keep the unit, but want the rollers shipped to my address as soon as possible. Thanks."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I used to have the old steam setter with salt. It worked for years and the curls always held for at least a whole day. And, all the reviewers who said there are 12 huge rollers are right. The description of the sizes was wrong. I didn't use any of the huge size. BUT, worst of all, even with the smaller sizes, my curls didn't even last ONE HOUR!After reading the reviews, I picked this one, figuring the folks who liked it were probably right and the ones who complained just didn't know how to use the steam setter. Well, the complainers were right. It's going back in the morning.I had such high hopes for this to help me look so special for my son's wedding in about a week and a half. At this rate, the curls wouldn't have lasted through the pre-wedding pictures and would have been gone before the guests arrived. Here's another incident of something not being made as well now as they used to make it.Save your money and buy something else!"
1,Horrible!,"These rollers are horrible. They dont hold a curl at all. I have tried every way imaginable - longer on the steamer, shorter on the steamer, longer in my hair, with a hair dryer, with gel, with mousse, with nothing, all different sized rollers.....and the result is the same - ugly, ugly, ugly. The curls are not uniform and they do not stay in my hair. Some of the rollers do not regain shape. They are just plain bad. Other reviewers are correct, the salt systems held my hair much better. I'm going back to my hot rollers - these rollers can go in the garbage. I really wish I would have listened to the other reviewers :-("
5,Curls galore.,"When I first used these, I thought the curlers were not hot enough to do anything but they really to work. It's nice not to have to burn your fingers to create a quick, curly hairstyle."
5,Caruso Molecular Steem Hairsetter,"I have used a Caruso Steam Hairsetter for more than 10 years. With the exception of one that I bought in July of 2008 from Amazon it has been a good product lasting for many years. It gives my hair the volume that I like and works well for my active life style. I'm a no fuss kind of person. I blow dry my hair, put the rollers in, put on my make up, grab some kind of breakfast, take the rollers out, brush through my hair, get dressed and I'm out the door. My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't stand behind products purchased on their website. I have to contact the manufacturer to deal with the Caruso set that stopped working in less than five months from date of purchase."
5,Consistent Convenience,"I have used this product for years...this must be the 4th or 5th I have purchased over the past 15 years. I use it everyday, and keep a ""spare"" in my travel bag. Easy on the hair, and easy on the budget."
2,Sad,"I was simply delighted to recive these legandary steam curlers for Christmas, I have always drempt of lovely luxerious curls and never found a way to achive such a look. I thought this was finally my chance.I followed the directions to a T and was wildly dispointed by the ultra uber subtle WAVE my uncurlable hair had obtained. I told myself that perhaps I had made a mistake still gung ho about providing volume and curl to my somewhat lifeless do. I tryed again...sort of, I tryed to try again but the steamer refused to produce steam, once again I attributed it to user error and waited a bit for an additional attmpt. The last and final trial was equal unsuccsesful. My golden locks shall never be graced with lushious curls, I suppose. THANK YOU CURUSO FOR CRUSHING A YOUNGE LADY'S HOPES AND DREAMS."
1,Out of Steam curler,"DONOT buy this . I owned 2 of these many years ago. The 1st lasted about 2 yrs., the 2nd last a few months. I had been trying for years to find this in stores to no avail ( now I see why no one wants to carry them ), after finding it here and ordering it,It lasted one week, went up in smoke after ONE WEEK. NEVER again !!"
3,Didn't get the results I was expecting,"I'm natural, and I was hoping that I would be about to use these to somewhat straighten my hair without the use of heat. The first time I used it, nothing happened. So I tried on stretched hair, that I did with a flat iron on low heat. Didn't put on curl in my hair...no wait, I lie. It did for this small section of hair that I accidently permanently straighten. So now, I'm just going to use it to condition my hair."
5,Great hair fast,I can do my hair in under ten minutes from dry with this and it looks great. For the curl to stay you have to let them dry all the way. Also I use conair roller clips instead of the covers. Much easier an no bumps in my hair.
2,Disappointing !,I ordered this product to add volume to my hair and it did not hold the volume for more than 5 minutes ! It is a waste of money..
2,1/1/10 - I won't use it this anymore!,"This product has some potential, but it's not good for all types of hair. The curls lasted awhile, but the ends of my hair were very frizzy - and that wasn't good - people were telling me I badly needed a trim."
2,Caruso C97953 Salonpro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter With 30 Rollers,It didn't curl my hair as well as my old curlers which was a bummer. Seems for my naturally curly hair I need to blow dry my hair first and then it will curl from the rollers. I like when I can just roll my hair after naturally drying.
4,Pretty good for Medium to long fine thin straight hair,"I am just tried out the caruso steam sponge rollers. I liked them more than i thought. The curls stay longer than when i used a curling iron or velcro rollers. They last me on average about 6 hours or so. It is very quick, even doing them one at a time, I am able to have my hair set and curled after about 15 minutes. I set them first, do my makeup and then take them out. It is enough time to set them and have them last one day. I do find with my type of hair I do have to do it once a day (even if i do not wash it) it does not stay the same type of curled. Also, sometime have to use a straight iron to uncrimp my hair from the holders since my hair is thin, or use the old school clips to keep the hair up. that works also. overall, very impressed! Best i have used yet for my hair. Works better than curling iron and damages hair less. works for me!"
5,Beats all other rollers,"These are great for fine to medium hair. Other rollers leave my hair limp after a couple hours, but the steam rollers give my hair lots of volume which lasts for a couple of days. The best part is that these curl without all the heat. No more burnt ears or neck! Easy to use and set up. The steamer itself requires so much less space than my old hot rollers which took up half my vanity. Great for travel too - just take the steamer and a few of the rollers.Tip - I had a dash of perfume to the water for the steamer which makes my house and my hair smell wonderful."
1,It sucks,"Where do i start? I am sorry but i can't believe they designed to hair. Not only that how did it make to amazon best seller list with 300 review? HA wow! I like my hair soft shiny and wavy. Guess what? this product does the opposite. After blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell... It gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry,twinkled. The steam makes your hair raw, dry. It's like putting a water on ur hair. Do not expect compliment or anything. worry about your hair. It was like abusing my hair. The next day or after a few hour try to brush ur hair, it is really difficult. The idea of steam doesn't give the desired result. Even though i get tight curl, It was really wired curl it makes my hair away short and frizzy. You don't want that. Thanks to return policy immediately return it. If you can find a good ceramics rollers are a way better. Are there any one that agrees with me??"
1,:(,This sucks i dont know if the whole product sucks or if I was just the lucky one that recieved a defective steamer it doesnt steam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i followed directions to the T nothing works I Emailed Bust buy about it yesterday I recieved no response yet so so far the product sucks I have to return it and the customer service sucks!!!!!!!!
1,Not good for fine hair,"The curlers would not stay put in my hair, not for fine hair . Also the clips were not easy to use"
5,Caruso Steam Roller Set,These rollers are great. I've tried them a few times and satisfied w/ the outcome. I will use them on a consistent basis.
3,Seems to have lost its steam,"I have been using Caruso steam rollers for years and have been very happy. I ordered a new steamer as a back up for my current one and I am not as impressed. The new one does not heat up as quickly or as hot. Therefore, I have to leave the rollers on the steamer for much longer than before, making getting ready in the morning longer. Also, since the rollers are not as hot, my style doesn't stay in as long. I long for the older model."
4,Nice Product,"I have 'difficult' shoulder length hair. Humidity is my enemy. I suggest using the largest rollers unless you want really curly hair. This products makes my hair soft. Like some of the reviews, the curl does not last very long but long enough for me. Don't expect your hair to look perfect the next day. I find letting my hair dry naturally and then setting. Curl last longer. Recommend this product for quickness and ease of use. Take your time doing it and you will be pleased!"
2,Worked less than 2 months,I had this less than 2 months & it broke I returned it for credit @ Amazon just before my time was up. I would have been really upset if I were stuck with it after 45 days. I did not even use it every day.
2,Great......while it works,"I used an earlier model for years with no problems. The rollers finally disentigrated and as I could get new rollers with the new model almost as cheaply as just buying the rollers separately, I bought the new one. It was great at first. Smaller, faster. But after less than 3 months....it quit! No warning signs, just stopped. I drug out my old model and fired it up. I travel some so I'm glad it didn't give out on a trip. Couldn't recommend it."
2,Doesnt work for me,"Well, this product doesnt agree with me. I must be doing something very wrong here since there are some really great reviews. My curls just dont stay in! I've had an Avon hot roller system (dont really remember details) and it actually curled my hair much better than this Caruso kit. I think the moisture from the steam makes my curls flop. No matter how long I leave the rollers in, (half a day or maybe just 15 minutes), I get no lasting curls. The sponges also wear out pretty quickly. I've probably only used them two or three times and the sponges look like they already need replacing. My hair is very fine... so probably hot curlers would work better. I mustered up two stars for this review because the kit comes with quite a lot of rollers..."
2,Disappointing,"Years ago I had a set of steam rollers which I loved. They were good for my naturally dry hair and worked really well. I'm not sure what happened to them, but several moves and years later I wanted some again. Stores didn't seem to carry anything but hot rollers, so I was pleased to find some on Amazon.They are disappointingly flimsy and hard to use. They come with a lot of rollers, of different sizes, but it doesn't make much difference. I have to wrap my hair around them very tightly to even get them to hold long enough to put on the clip. Maybe there's a technique I don't know about, but I've used them several times and haven't found it any easier. If I manage to do it, I still like the way the steam works with my curly, dry hair. However, I wish they had a better roller system, with some way to catch and hold the hair."
1,not happy,I used this 5-6 times and it will no longer steam. Going to see if I can get some response from company (not optomistic) but would not recommend and I would not buy this brand again.
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I bought the rollers to use on trips. It's not really that compact since the rollers take up a lot of space.I have trouble getting the clips over the rollers, but am getting a little bit better with practice.I think my hair gets too wet with the steam. I prefer regular hot rollers."
1,poor steam production,This hairsetter just won't produce much steam. It is the 2nd one I've bought here. The first quit steaming at all. I guess the bargain...wasn't.
4,Great Curls,I just purchased this product and the curls are great. They are smooth and shiny and I have no frizzy hair.I am not that happy with the curler shields. In the manual they mention that one could use regular metal clips but I can't get these to hold. The diagram is very poor! Has anyone tried this. The shields tend to leave a markThanks
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT!,"This is my 3rd one in about 12 years, I won't use anything else. I use it daily. It is gentle on my hair & lightweight. I was in a panic when I couldn't locate another Caruso hairsetter in the retail stores or beauty supply stores. So happy to have my new replacement!!"
4,Love it.....,I have used the setter about four times so far and with every use it gets better and better. My first try it took me about an 1 hour and 15 mins. to complete. Over the weekend I used it and it took about 30 mins. this time. I am an AA and my hair gets pretty frizzy and it works wonders on my hair (except for the new growth). The only thing I would suggest is to use a little moisturizer on your ends and end paper to combat the frizz.
3,My first attempt at rollers.... a bust.,"I purchased this product because the steam seemed like it would make a very natural soft curl, which it does. The problem is the rollers. Since they are foam, in order to have them hold your hair you have to wrap tightly, undoing any good of using a ""large"" roller. I wish there was a steam-based system with hard rollers."
5,Caruso hairsetters,I love my hairsetter. It will not dry your hair out. It puts moisture in it from the syeam. It only takes minutes and last all day. Thank You for such a great product.Pam Shifflett
3,Caruso molecular steam hairsetter,"I love the product as far as it's effectiveness - but am disappointed that after only 3 months, the unit needs to be replaced."
3,"For me, it is okay but not stellar","I was expecting a lot from this hairsetter because my friend raves about it and so do the Amazon reviews! For me, the product is okay but not stellar. It's hard to wrap my hair around the spongy roller. Maybe I'm just used to rolling my hair around harder surfaces, like a curling iron or plastic roller. Anyway, perhaps someone needs to train me in the way of Caruso!"
5,Caruso Molecular Steam Hairsetter is Awesome!,"I have tried to curl my hair with all kinds of rollers. Curling irons curl my hair, but the curls wilt after 30 minutes. The only one that really gives a great curl and lasting curls is the Caruso Molecular Steam Hairsetter. I have worn out two and am on my third one. I love it. It is the best and my hair is fine, but not baby fine.It takes so little time to get a good set. No curlers over night, no sleepless nights.They work so fast and last so long.I recommend these to anyone who wants great long lasting curls."
1,Very poor quality.,"This is about the fourth Caruso I have owned in the last 15 years. I have had a few problems with them but never any as extreme as this one. The quality is a bit hit and miss on this model. I have read poor reviews about it at other sites but I decided to ignore them based on my previous experience with the product. That was a bad decision. My Caruso stopped working after 1 month of VERY LIMITED use. It just died. I have no idea what happened but I'm not very happy about it. So far two of the ones I've owned stopped working after about a year, two lasted several years, and this one lasted only 1 month. That's not good."
3,Caruso C97953 SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter with 30 Rollers,"The overall quality is very good and the system performs well.The steam is very gentle to the hair and forms long lasting curls.The draw backs are the sponge rollers and the clamps. While the rollers may work well for long or curly hair they don't work so well for medium or short straight hair. The sponge rollers do not grasp hair and it is almost impossible to coax the hair to wrap around roller. I finally resorted to purchasing velcro rollers, removing the velcro and hot glueing it around the Carusso sponge roller. The other problem is the clamp which holds the roller in place. It leaves a dent in the hair which has to be removed with a curling brush and blow dryer. I would give this product an A+ if the rollers and clamps were better designed but as is I give it a C."
5,good curl formation,I'm a hair stylist and have used these for years on hard to curl hair.I have found they work on most hair type.with a little practice you can set a full head in short order.The other brand of rollers will fit this unit and can be found here cheaper.
2,critique,black out when changing scenerynot letting viewer know what part of the world you are coveringseems to jump all overtherefore not as relaxing as it could be
2,Dull images.,"This title has many video footage taken from good angles but most of them were taken during unconducive weather, resulting in images with poor lighting. Vegetation was a dull green instead of vivid green. Overall video image color is not vivid, which I think is important for such product to captivate the audience. Compared this title to ""Glacier National Park"" by Wilderness Video, the Glacier National Park is so much better in terms of image quality due to the vivid color of its images.If one is expecting the type of stunning nature scenery shots one often saw in BBC Earth products in this title, one will be very disappointed."
1,hollow and horrible!,"don't know why dolph lundgren never got the chance to upgrade himself from the b or c movies to a level. all of his movies either sucked big time or totally lukewarm and mediocre, unworthy of wasting any time or word to give a detailed review, unlike steven seagal, who at least had some prime time then keep going down the hill, lundgren never reached any hilltop but always struggled in the deep valley with lousy screenplay, lousy dialogue, lousy plot, lousy scenario....and now he's trying so hard to come back before he becomes too old for being an action hero, he's even tried to direct couple of action movies recently. but sadly speaking, none of his tryings ever paid off, his movies still looked so deadbeat and sometimes even ridiculous. this one is not so exceptional from the other, except even more horrible and hollow. what a shame for a guy tried so hard but always failed."
1,fit,does not fit as nicely as the lens hoods made by Canon but any difference is clearly offset by the cost savings.
5,All Aussies - you have to read this book!,I couldn't stop grinning when I read this book. Which was a bit embarassing as I was on the Tube in London at the time and you are not supposed to show any emotion on there! Excellent book - brought back memories as I have been all around Australia but the expressions were what cracked me up the most. Already passed it onto a friend and told others about it.
1,Actually- no star- pathetic,"The Lonely Planet Publishing organization lost a lot of credibility by publishing this worthless travel experience. The two arrested development men see nothing but the inside of bars, toilet bowls while barfing, tv in the hotels while recovering from hangovers and fast food places. They should have remained home. Actually, David does go to some of the parks but unfortunately, he did not write the book.You know how people draw cartoons of dead birds, feet up in the air, with XXXs in their eyes? Well- that is an apt description of these two members of the x generation I guess- dead in the head as dodos."
1,worst book ever,"This is by far the worst book ever written. The author was obviously in a really bad mood when he wrote this as he had nothing good to say about Australia. Being an Aussie i have travelled a fair bit of our continent, and it is beautiful. This book so offensive that it left me feeling like someone had just punched Australia in the guts. If you are planning a trip down under, do yourself the greatest favour and never read this."
1,boring description of two drunks,"I found the book funny in parts, but increasingly boring and unfortunately I really got to dislike the author. I wouldn't ever want to meet him. Unfortunately there's a lot of Australians like him, ignorant, drunk and racist."
2,"long ride, slow read",Not a read I will repeat. Mr. Condon has too much angst and spends faaaaar too much time telling readers that he and his traveling partner David have girlfriends and therefore aren't gay. He's a little too concerned in getting that message across and not all that interesting when telling the tales of his trip.
4,I'm not sure I'd want foreigners reading this!,"I finished S&D'sLD last night in a very 3 star motel in Canberra. (I'd spent the day at a training course at the far more salubrious Lakeside where Sean & David stayed while in the nation's capital!) I couldn't help thinking that Sean may put potential visitors off...Sean Condon's view of - especailly Outback - Australia is not unique, but might be one we try to hide from foreigners! It is very funny, and occaisionally tragic....and has both the best and worst of the country (check out the brightly coloured teddy bears in the motel rooms, and the hotel that charges for radiator water!). Recommended.PS Don't use a '64 Falcon in the outback - there's not much that can go wrong with a lady that age, but the rattles will wake the dead.Oh, and check out the Monica Lewinsky connection with the author!"
3,Silly romp around Oz,This is a silly book about driving around Australia. It is composed a lot of silly notes. A 2 day read. Ok if you like Australia. Quick easy read.
2,Outback Jocks,"This book is not really about Australia, it's a travelogue based upon the goings-on inside a Ford Falcon over a few weeks. It's one of these self consciously humorous books which strains after a while. The journey is somewhat joyless with the author complaining about its monotony and making jibes about everywhere he visits. Many pages are devoted to discussing their record collection (as it's played in the car) and very random thoughts which the author noted on his tape recorder. The sort of thing no doubt usually forgotten. I did not like the contrived ""don't care Gen-X"" attitude which pervades the book - after a while I didn't care to read it either."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I bought In Search of Wales because I'm part Welsh, am visiting Wales soon, and have read other H.V.Morton books and enjoyed them thoroughly. I find his writing in general to be readable, historically accurate, and empathic; he seems to have had an encyclopedic knowledge of many of the places to which he traveled, and the ability to make that knowledge interesting and relevant to the place and the reader. In Search of Wales, though, it seemed was not closest to his heart; it seemed to be written with much less attention to history from the Welsh perspective, indeed little attention to Welsh history at all. It seemed like the average tourist's scenic stroll through a new country, very obviously treating the Welsh people with an Englishman's view of their history. Not nearly as informative or as packed full of legend and history as his Traveler in Italy or In Search of Scotland, two of my favorites..."
3,Did not Get the Power 2000 Brand but a Generic Battery,"Seller shipped a Generic Battery not the Power 2000 ACD625 that I ordered. Fortunately, I was able to return it at no cost and get back every penny of my purchase. I give thumbs up to the seller for not making a fuss about it."
2,Rancid batch,I just received my order today and was thrilled...until I opened one of the bottles. The smell was rancid and I thought it was from the plastic inside the bottle. I have used extra-virgin in a jar and it smelled nothing like this. I requested a refund ASAP!
4,A Yankee Flier in the RAF,"I have read all of his Golden Stallion books as a kid, so was interested to see this non-horse story. It was good, and an interesting story of the Battle of Britain."
2,"Sickly-sweet, over-orchestrated bilge","I dimly remembered some of these tunes from my childhood, so I thought I'd give this disc a shot. I guess Baxter's arrangements were OK in their time, but that time is long gone. Unless you like your music WAY overblown, with over-the-top instrumentals and sighing choruses, skip this one."
3,good album,"I was really dissapointed with this album, I feel that Marty Friedman could have done much better than this."
4,Great book!,"This is a fast-paced, exciting and well-written book, about early missionary endeavors in tribal Africa. It's fiction, as far as I know, but it reads like one of the best researched thrillers of today. Some people may not like the antiquated language (a Bantu person is called a Negro, but not derogatorily) but to me that's just normal for when the book was written. I found myself wanting to meet the people in the book!"
2,It was required for part of a course I had for my Master's Degree.,"I really just used very little of this book for part of a course I took during my Master's Degree... it's kind of OK, but I did not really like it very much.I did, however, keep it - for whatever that is worth."
4,Some real gems included in this book,"This is a book regarding leadership and management using some of the most popular essays written for the HBR in the last 30 years. I enjoyed a few of the essays immensely, especially about the difference between management and leadership. It's a short book so spending your valuable time on this one is well worth it and I certainly appreciated the work from the writers. My favorite essay was included as chapter one and it referred to the many roles of today's managers. Amazing work and extremely gratifying since I am a manager. In summary, well worth your time to increase your skills."
3,nice amateurism,"The guy that glued the labels on the records must have been drunk, or at least ""eccentric"".The ones that put the sleeve together must have been stoned.The records are quite ok, maybe way too expensive..But quite fun to have 'm really"
4,ALMOST MADE IT!,"Well, It almost made it to a 5. Not quite!Frannie Vaughn was almost a good girl, having only 2 lovers.Malcolm Bridger almost made it as a bad boy. But he proved endearingly lovable.Just hate these stories that think it is almost good if there is sex before marrying. It seems like a good story will not sell well with almost a touch of morality??The characters are excellent - the mystery really good -- the situations very believable.Loved Bridger's family and his interplay with his nephew. We do need some women who are not afraid of the challenge of loving our ""Men in Blue"". How about [grin] some who pursue the uniform first and then fall for the man?Very, Very good plus except for their lack of restraint.Ah well, it takes all kinds!"
4,Very good textbook for the statistic model,This is a very good textbook. Since it covers most of important topics in the short pages. Authors assume that readers have the good background in the linear model. So if you have good background in linear model and statistic inference this will be the wonderful book for the statistic student. This is only one problem of this book. It cost toooo much for a poor student! Thus I take one point out.
4,Bad Azz is good but should have but should have included a 2nd disc,"I'm going to start off by saying I like Lil Boosie. And Bad Azz was supposed to be released last August(2005). It wasn't cause it was bootlegged. The bootleg had some good songs like ""Big Dog"", ""Touch Down & Cause Hell"" & ""They Be On A Nigga"". It being released early made Boosie have to go back to the studio and basically record a new album. I'm going to assume this album was supposed to be a double cd.(He says in the 1st song on the album that this is the sickest double disc since 2Pac) But its only a single disc. The second CD could have been a version of his previous Bad Azz disc. I have this but its a bootleg and very poor quality. So I wish I could have had a good copy of the songs. And songs like ""Booty Talk"" and a couple of more tracks aren't on the album. The only thing I can think of is they didn't want to give a new artist a double disc on his first major release. Good album though."
1,Wow...,"This guy honestly scares me. How this idiot could get a record deal is beyond me. The songs are retarded much like the person that raps them. If you're going to listen to rap, which is bad enough, at least listen to talented artists."
5,Da Truth in Da Streets,"Boosie is the truth man no one touching him! He keep it 100 percent all day. Boosie been rocking now its time for the whole world to start rocking! ""You betta tell them how im rockin mom"". You gotta cop dis cd its all da way gangsta. Boosie got real split all day. Boosie Bad Azz yall already know he got them yellow eyes like his dad eyes! THis Cd is hardcore Boosie is really da truth. dont listen to me get the cd and find out for urself. LOUISIANA YEAAAAAAAAA!"
5,TIGHT,"I am not a kid. I just did not buy the album from amamzon. Lil Boosie is the realest rapper out now. While you other rappers are rapping and rhyming about nothing, Boosie tells life storys.His music is the best out the south right now. He makes crowd pleasing music. Boosie and Webbie goes the hardest out the south."
3,Not completely trash but close. 2.5 stars actually,"If you get past the generic beats that you hear everyday on the radio and actually listen to what he is saying on some records like ""My Stuggle"" or ""Hatin'"", you have to give him some credit. He is not as bad as (like horrible) the artists that are coming out today but I wouldn't call him the truth or that he is representing Louisiana because he is still bad. He has potential to be a really good rapper, IF he got rid of those lame beats, get better subjects to rap about (besides life in the hood and haters) and pick up a thesaurus along with a dictionary. This album would have been fine if it was made in the 90's or just for the clubs today but for casual listening, just no."
4,Bootsiebad,I am an ol school music lover but certain songs on hear caught my attention so you youngsters enjoy it.
3,"good enough for such price, but not very high quality","I use this one for my cell phone and it is good enough for its price. However, when i copy some music into the card, sometimes it denies to do it despite how many times i try, quite a bit frustrating! But for a cheap price, it is enough"
1,BEWARE!!!,"With this sellers item I was suppose to receive a 2 GB micro SD card along with 2 different adapters. I only got the micro SD card and the larger adapter but didnt get the smaller adapter in the picture (which was the whole reason I bought it). The product took about ten days to arrive, and I tried to contact the seller and cant ever get through to them all I get is a busy signal so im hoping someone from Amazon will read this and help me work this out. I would return the item but the shipping is more than I paid for the product so it isnt worth it. Other than that the micro SD and adapter i got works fine. Be cautious with this seller because sometimes you dont get whats in the pictures and product description so for these reasons I give one star... Sorry..."
5,Great for phones.,My husband and I are going to be getting new phones in a few days and so we did not want to loose the pictures that we had taken with the ones we have now. This card was great to put into the phone and tansfer all the pictures. Most of them are pictures of our daughter during her first few months after she was born. We felt like we would be losing a part of our new family if we lost all thos pictures. We sometimes have a hard time with getting cards to work but this one went right into the phone and it was read immediately. As soon as I pulled it out and put it into the adapter to put the pictures on my computer it worked like a charm.
5,Calendar Girls,"An absolutely wonderful movie. I highly recommend, especially for expanding one's culture. This was a true story about some women from England who chose to make a difference for someone else and used an extraordinary way to do so. Very tastefully done."
4,Adorable,Both my mother and I loved it. If you don't mind a little 'mature' female nudity the storyline is sweet and at time hysterical. The performances show a broad range of emotions. It's a great movie to watch when you just want to relax.
4,Pleasant Diversion!,"A pleasant movie depicting small town life in England, and perhaps in other places as well. The friendship of the women is laudable, and that kind of thinking and action is missing from so much of life here in the US. Women who have known each other for many, many years and who obligate themselves to regularly attend scheduled meetings of the Women's Institute, despite boredom and disinterest of many of them with the meetings' agendas. The women still attend, and maintain their contact with each other . . for what? . . for friendship! The nude calendar, where the women are not really shown nude, is a pleasant diversion for them, compensating them for years of listening to experts on broccoli and the vagaries of toast, etc. How realistic is the story??? . . . I hope that places like this do exist."
4,Most enjoyable,"I had been looking for this movie for sometime based on reviews from others who had seen it. It was not available through the many streaming, rental businesses. When I found it on Amazon as a on-demand rental, I was most pleasantly surprised. The movie provided a very enjoyable evening for my husband and me. I am a fan of Helen Mirren and she doesn't disappoint in this role. The premise seemed rather outlandish, but concerns immediately faded away as the movie was filled with very good acting and enough comedy and drama to complete the enjoyment."
2,Get nude for Calendar Girls,i found this movie to be slow and boring. But i found the story to be good. I thought the idea of having older ladies pose nude for a Calendar was cool. And they did it for a good reason. I didn't know it was based on a true story. Untile i watched it. I think it took guts for those ladies to do what they did. The story is mainly about one woman who lost her husband to lucimia. And she is in a club called WIC. When WIC has thier yearly calendar her best friend Krissy had the idea to pose nude for a calendar and raise money to supoort Lucimia treatment. Like i said the story was good but i found the movie boring.If you liked this movie check out the soundtrack.
1,"Marginal, at best","This is one of those small budget Britcoms that is supposed to be hilarious and all the trailer clips suggest that. Problem is it's not very funny, well-acted, or even mildly engaging. It's flat out boring. It is not a female ""The Full Monty,"" as the ad campaign leads you to think. If that were the case I would have loved it. Others can re-tell the plot, but there isn't really much beyond these ordinary women in a small English town do a nude calendar to raise money and all the hinjinx prevail. Except there really are no hijinx. Just the usual stereotypical disapproving neighbors and officials, combined with the always surprising support from the most unlikely (wink-wink) circles. Been there--seen that over and over. It's as if every cliche in these types of movies were rehashed over and over.Save your money. Frankly, I think the positive reviews on this are the true comedy."
1,Utterly rubbish! 15th april 2004.,"Saw it at the cinema, so boring. I think this movie would be great for a lady, they would enjoy it more than i did, although it is a good film."
5,Calendar Girls - excellent,"This movie made a statement that just because your body may be growing older, your heart and your spirit are not."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This movie is SO WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!! I cried, I laughed...I cried some more! I absolutely LOVE it and can watch it over & over again & again! Definite re-watchability! Even my husband likes it! HIGHLY recommend!"
5,Calendar Girls is wonderful!!,"Fascinating story of efforts to raise money in the most unconventional way possible - a nude calendar of middle-aged women. Loved the way it was done, the story line and the actresses. The sublety used for the photography is fantastic. Plan to enjoy it for many years to come."
2,Calendar Girls review,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is wonderful. All the ladies just seem to click. The story is very heart warming and one that most people can relate to. I could watch this movie over and over and laugh and cry everytime I see it.Calendar Girls
3,Calender Girls,This film and the other one we ordered arrived eventualy after almost two weeks had passed. Calender Girls had been cut and there were many parts missing. Not happy at all.
1,Customer Service Awful,"Purchased this DVD not realizing there were ""Regions"". I've been buying DVD's for years and have never known about ""Regions"". I ordered the wrong ""Region"". OK, that was my mistake, but they make it so hard to return/replace the movie. By the time I return the DVD, minus shipping, I might as well throw the thing in the trash and order another one on EBAY."
5,favorite video,"I had seen this movie quite a while ago and since then had casually looked for it in the stores to buy it. I never saw it for sale. Recently, something made me remember this movie and the fact that I had never found it for sale so I ordered it from Amazon who sent me to you. The price was great, the service excellent and I got my video finally. It's in excellent condition. This movie will make you smile and poke fun at the british humour in it. I love all the ladies in this movie, they are priceless."
3,BBC type middle aged Calendar girls,"How to rise money for your local cancer charity?The mostly unlikely naked/ nude calendarin the world is middle aged house wives from middle class England?Right out of fetish porn maybe, you are thinking?You really have to see this movie to believe it.It has that understated British humor effect."
4,A quaint British movie,"The movie has a British feel to it, like ""Four Wedding and a Funeral."" It'll make you laugh and cry, but in the end it'll but a smile on your face. The only bad part was the scenes in America, which took away from the British feel, but it quickly came back."
5,True to Yorkshire,"The characters reminded me of the woman my grandmother must have been in her 50's. The Yorkshire scenery made me homesick for a place in which I didn't grow up, but still feel attached to through my roots. I attended the WI meetings as a child guest with my grandmother and I remember liking plum jam and Victoria sponge! The acting was superb and true to the characters."
5,Hilarious Movie with a Fantastic Cast,"I loved this movie! The cast is wonderful, the plot is truly inspiring, and it'll have you in tears of laughter. Set against the beautiful scenery of Yorkshire, this charming comedy is a delight to behold!"
1,Boring...,Extremely boring movie - fast forwarded and then just stopped it - but did give it a chance. I guess if you're in a retirement home you may enjoy it but no thanks. Not recommended.
4,Golden Girls with Iron Fists,"This was a delightful movie! Based on the assumption that an outrageous act was set in motion to achieve a humanistic, altruistic goal, the antics that these women participate in are very entertaining.This picture truely represents modern older women at their best. Courageously, they develope a funny, outlandish and avant gard plan to reach a goal which is selfless and humane.Helen Mirren, best known as a tough minded British detective working the ranks in a ""males world"" could not have been better. The other actressess add their own special quality and character to this film.This film is not intense or intellectual. It's statement is pure and uncomplicated. The story line is easy enough to follow and is just plain fun to watch! Like fine wine, women become more valuable with age.Simply a good""kick back and enjoy"" sort of flick!!!"
3,OK but not GREAT ~,This title is a good selection as a rental (you only have to look at it once) than a permanent purchase for your home collection. The film drags. Very slow on several levels. The screenplay is not a succesful attempt at being artsy by those folks at DISNEY.
4,pleased!,"tape came in a timely fashion in very good condition. am pleased. amazon is very helpful in finding vhs tapes or anything else, for that matter..thanks"
5,Outstanding,"This book is must-reading for project managers. The writing is crisp, and the chapters short -- each topic is nailed tight. I can see myself re-reading parts of this book in years to come as a refresher on core concepts. There is a case-study woven into the text to illustrate various techniques. About the only improvement I could recommend to the book would be that the case-study be more fully developed (with detailed requirements, diagrams, models, etc), perhaps in an appendix."
4,A good book,"We used this book in my Information Systems Analysis class. It was quite good at supplementing the lectures we had in class, and overall was very helpful."
1,All wrong,"This book is the antithesis of what I consider normal, healthy eating habits. What the author doesn't realize is that dieting only perpetuates overeating. Most people can only live with such restrictions for awhile before they go crazy and EAT EAT EAT. The only solution is to return to natural eating ... and believe me, you WILL lose weight. I weigh 105 lbs and I got here by eating whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. There is a fabulous book called ""The 7 Secrets of Slim People"" and it explains how to give up dieting forever. It's the best thing I've ever done!"
3,"Annoying for me, joy for my son","I am not sure what I was thinking, but these were a stocking stuffer for my 4yo son this year. He loves them - they are noisy and light up! I find the noise level to be a bit loud and the song they play repetitive and irritating. However, my son would rate these a solid 5 stars. I am not nuts about how small the controls are, but so far they have been pretty durable."
3,"fun, but loud","I got these for my son and he loves them. I don't like the fact that there is not an option to change the volume level. Also, the buttons are a little poor quality. One of the buttons don't even push in, it's like it's just there for looks."
3,MOST ANNOYING THINGS EVER!,"This seemed like a great idea...Until we got them and realized there is NO volume control. It is either BLAST YOUR EARDRUMS LOUD or off....I prefer off. My husband ended up hiding these because they drove us so crazy...Beware if your buying these, they are LOUD!They would make a perfect gift for the child of people you really don't like."
2,not very good,these are not too good though they lasted a little while they broke within about 2 months.
5,Croscill Macrame Bath Towel,"I love this towel. It is a very well-made, high quality towel. We just finished renovating a guest bath and I can't tell you how elegant this towel looks in there. It is definitely the ""finishing"" touch I was searching for. The high quality, macrame and fringe design completed the look I set out to achieve when starting the guest bath renovation, i.e., elegance, sophistication and luxury!"
3,Just Okay...,"This concise Art History Guide provides a very basic overview of art through the ages. It's in black and white and the examples are very small. It would be helpful for the Intro to Art History student who needs a basic breakdown of the timeline. As most students will attest, a college level art history course gets kind of overwhelming with all of the details. This book offers a student to take a step back and learn the most important points."
5,"Easy Reading, Heart Tugging","I'll read more by this author. The story moved along without getting bogged down in details and off the beaten path side stories. It was an easy read, kept my attention and just couldn't wait to see what happened next."
3,Mixture,"Good: The characters and situation are interesting and plausible. Gilman's usual good characterization.Bad: It's easy to get lost in the details. I also didn't care for the ending. After hanging in there through the whole story, I guess I wanted something less mysterious and sad."
4,familiar and comforting,"It'd been a long time since I'd read a Dorothy Gilman novel for the first time. I read most of them as a preteen and a young teenager, but not this one. I know she's kind of an odd author for a kid to be into, especially the Mrs. Polifax series, but I loved her stuff, especiallyCaravan.This book was a good, quick read. It reminded me a lot of some of her other books, especiallyA Nun in the Closet. It seems to me that Dorothy Gilman frequently incorporates the same elements in her books--gypsies, free spirits, some sort of spiritual teacher, and Zambia. All those things are here, making the book comforting and familiar to me, if not totally original.There's often magic and spiritualism too. One thing I like about Gilman is that she leaves the interpretation up to the reader. Was what happened magic, or is there some more mundane explanation? I've tried to incorporate some of that same freedom of interpretation into my own book, [...]."
4,An excellent intro to some of Brazil's top pop singers,"There are many compilations of Brazilian pop (MPB) for beginners in US record stores, ranging from downright awful to OK. This one has all the biggest names (Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Milton Nascimento)and better-than-average selections from each. It's important to know what you're getting: quality popular music from the 70s and 80s by the Brazilian equivalents of Barbara Streisand and James Taylor, not the latest Afro-Brazilian Axe dance bands or traditional folk music. A good intro to the Brazilian singers who have stood the test of time and are cultural icons across generations. If I had to choose between this album and the similar ""Beleza Tropical"" compiled by Gabriel Byrne, I'd choose this one."
1,Stones and Beatles missing in action,"...none of the songs on this album sound like Mick Jagger or Strawberry Fields Forever-era Beatles. I am very disapointed. I wanted to get my yah-yah's out or at least my yeah, yeah, yeah's. Instead I have a CD of people singing things I don't understand. They don't speak Spanish as well as me even though I took it in junior high school only. They pronounce things in a weird way, almost like they were from Portugal. Geez!"
4,Fun action CD for toddlers and preschoolers,"I got this CD after listening to it at story time at our local library. The ""Peanut Butter and Jelly song"" is the best version I have heard. Very action oriented and very upbeat. Another really good song in the CD is the ""I can work with one hammer"" song which is similar to the Wiggles song."
4,Sparkley,"The ring is sparkley. Delivery was very fast. It is a nice ring to wear to a night club. Good quality. The only thing I don't like about it - the color is more yellowish in reality, I wish it was more like in the picture."
5,Beautiful ring!!,"I bought this ring for a gift for a friend, and am just thrilled with it! It is a substantial ring that will stand out and get attention. You have to see it to appreciate how much is sparkles and shines. You really can't afford NOT to buy this ring!"
5,Wife loves it!,Bought this to match with the the bridal necklace from the same brand (see my review under the same title). The set is my wife's favorite now. And she looks beautiful wearing it.Very happy with my choice! :)
3,too dressy for everyday earrings,"I bought these to wear to a wedding. For the price these are a great deal but a little too dressy for everyday earrings! So, I wouldn't recommend these. They aren't very comfortable."
3,Pretty but too small,I thought these earrings were bigger. They are pretty but I'm not going to wear them for my wedding as planned.
5,Beautiful earrings,"These earrings are beautiful for the price. The diamonds above the crystal drop are smaller than the picture indicates, but still doable. I bought these for my wedding and look wonderful with my dress. I am very happy with these earrings!"
1,Not A Good Idea for Girls,"These dolls may be appealing, but as a former astrologer, I can say that it is a 100% bad idea to have girls, who are still forming their own style and personality, identify with a zodiac sign. This is limiting and puts them in a box. Parents, please think outside the zodiac box and do not buy this doll for your child!"
1,STUPID,"This is suppose to be a Wal Mart Exclusive. It's a *yawn* doll, what's so special about it? There too many Zodiac dolls to keep up with. I mean, It's just a doll with a dress with some sign on it. All the Zodiac dolls are basically clones(except for the colour of the skin, hair, and dress) That's it! It's just boring. I don't think it's even a Barbie collector at all. It think it's just a barbie that you take out of the box and play with. BORING!"
2,Deceptive labeling,"Received the edition in a relatively short time, however the title on both the ad and the packing list stated there were two books in the bold title. When I received it there was only one book and in fine print under ""Comments"" it stated ""one book only"". I guess I've learned to read ""everything""! This is a Teacher's edition book for a Math class for my homeschooled student; hopefully we can find the second book elsewhere before she gets to that part of her studies."
3,STARFIST Series begins to run out of Gas - uses variant of John Grimes Story,"HANGFIRE (4/2001) is the sixth book in the STARFIST 25th Century Military SciFi series, descibing the battles and skirmishes that a company of Space Marines gets involved with on far-flung planets.This book introduces a new technique of jumping between two completely different storylines throughout the book... one of the storylines is simply to set up the scene for the next two books in the series... the second storyline is a retell of A. Bertram Chandler's MATILDA'S STEPCHILDREN (1979), involving a rogue playground world where Roman gladitorial battles are held in a Colosseum.As has been the case in the first 5 books in the series, there is virtually no new technology introduced, and most of the military technology used in the books is little more advanced that what we now have in 2008, and some (like UAV technology) is actually behind the times."
3,A poor selection,Most people want Martin Denny for his tropical music-complete with screeching birds and jungle drums. This selection is bland and does not give you what you expect. Try another album.
2,"A short story, a quick read","As a kid I really enjoyed the Piers Anthony Xanth series, so I figured I would probably enjoy the writing style of this book. Unfortunately I think my tastes have changed in 20 years. While the book was entertaining for the most part, I have to agree with the other reviewers: It was written for children, or probably more specifically, ""the child in all of us"". It was also a very quick read. Parts of the story, including a major plot feature (I won't spoil it) felt very tacked on (and as it turns out, that feature was tacked on, according to the author's notes at the end). I give it 2 stars: It did cover unusual sexual territory, as promised, but fell quite short on actual adult entertainment."
3,Different,"This is not typical Piers Anthony, but it was still hard to put down, just like all of his books."
1,"Very, Very, Bad",I can't imagine anything good to say about this book. Really I can't. The pacing is horrid. The plot has no sense of purpose and the characters are tissue-paper thin. It's nice Piers decided to let go and write something as dirty as he obviously wanted to (Read Wielding a Red Sword for a good example) but he did so poorly.
3,Medium Level Entertainment,"I am a big fan of Piers Anthony and I enjoy some good taboo sex, so I thought I would love Pornucopia. After reading it though, I don't really feel much of anything. It was a very ho-hum book. I would suggest you do not get it confused with erotica. Though a select few might be turned on by the subject matter it was mostly just very strange and did not elicit much emotion, only puzzlement with a touch of gross. Most of the sex involved varying levels of bestiality, scatology and rape. Not the turn-you-on-she-actually-wants-it type of rape either. Worst of all there wasn't any deep meaning or theme to derive from the story (or at least none that I could find). Maybe ""be happy with your penis size"", but this isn't really the conclusion. The protagonist instead decides a variety of sizes is best. Not much help there. Three stars for medium level entertainment, and having the good grace to keep it short and sweet."
1,Awful nonsense dressed up as literature!,"Piers Anthony must have been very, very bored when he turned this one out. It is utter nonsense and not worthy of anyone's time. Anthony has produced plenty of good books in his time, but this is most definitely NOT one of them."
3,Tongue-in-cheek humor,"If you're a veteran of Piers Anthony, you know that he plays fast and loose with the subject of sex. At times, I found it a bit tiresome (like in ...And Eternity), and this book is no exception. Yes, this book is supposed to be ABOUT sex as opposed to other series/books, and don't get me wrong, there were plenty of amusing parts in this book. If you're a prude, you won't like it, but if you find sex humor to be funny, you will like it.Many of the characters fall flat and come across as cardboard, but given the plot, it kind of makes sense. This is just not a book for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed the Incarnations and Geodyssey books more than this. If you like Piers Anthony and find his odd humor to be funny, pick up this book. For me, it was a enjoyable, laughable read. Not his greatest work, but certainly not bad, either."
3,More than expected...,The story was well written. The content was a little more than I was expecting though.
1,Not Author's Best - By FAR!,Piers Anthony is capable of much better than this. Even his later Xanth books were more clever than this offering. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
4,Very Nice!,I am very impressed with this ring. It is everything i hoped it would be and my wife loves having it to wear when needed. You will be happy with this purchase.
4,A very interesting volume,"What a great book! Especially for we who grew up in the '40s and '50s and later became air force pilots. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, a bond drive aircraft arrived at our local airport. It was an O-47 observation plane, with a real machine gun in the rear hatch. What a thrill for a 10 year old. Of course as I grew older, I realized that the old O-47 was a pretty sorry example of America's might, but things were really different in the early 40's. However, it was very gratifying to see an article in this book about flying that aircraft in those early years. There are thousands of accounts of WW2 flying out there, almost all devoted to the outstanding aircraft of those times. This book, however has many an article devoted to how it was to fly the other unsung aircraft. There are not too many pilot accounts of flying the P-39, the P-40 in Italy, the C-54 in ATC service much less the B-18, B-10 and the old C-46. Really a must read for those who remember those early war years."
1,pretty but doesn't work,"It is an attractive piece of furniture but the cd part didn't work. Soo Amazon replaced it with another one. That one didn't work either for the same reason. Amazon said they would return my money but when I considered that the radio and the turntable and the audio tape worked ok, for $200.00 and it looked good, perhaps I was expecting too much. Therefore I kept it even though it doesn't completely work."
2,CD Player didn't work,"The CD player didn't work if you had all 3 CD inside, and after the 2nd attemp it got jammed. We had to spend a couple of minutes turning the device on and off hoping it would open the CD player. I returned the item, disappointment since this was a christmas present."
5,One of my favorites of all time,"I watched this as a kid and I still think it is a wonderful show. I recommend it hightly. As an aside, my kids love to hear Shere Khan's voice not coming from a tiger!"
4,Drama or Comedy?,"Whenever I have watched this movie, and I have more than once, upon reflection I have had to ask myself one basic question: ""Do I cry or laugh?"" After all, the irascible ghost owner of the house(and only Rex Harrison could have played that part)soon fell in love with the beautiful, sweet and lovely Mrs. Muir (and the beautiful Gene Tierney was molded for that part), but he was saddened when she ""traded him in for another man"".But is a ghost able to empirically know the feelings of love and sadness? Forget the rather moot point. Laying your choice of rubric aside, the movie was, true, comical in places, but it also was definitely a warm movie. In addition to Tierney and Harrison, Natalie Wood played her part well; a child star then, she was adorable as Mrs. Muir's daughter. All things considered, this was certainly an entertaining production."
5,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"This movie is my all time favorite. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want your own Sea Captain Ghost after seeing this movie. You will also want to live in the beautiful seaside home in this movie. If you want a feel good movie then this one is for you. Two thumbs up."
5,Wow what a great movie,Just recently started watching old movies from well before my time and I'm surprised at how much better they are than much of what gets put out now.This could be one of if not the best movie ever (excluding the entire works of Humphrey Bogart-a class of thier own) Gene Tierney was amazing and the whole movie can't even be described it's so good-nothing at all can be said that comes close to the amazing range of feeling you get from this incredible film.
4,I want a ghost like this in my house.,"For anyone that never saw the film or the 1960s tv series based on this film, I submit a few words.A Poor widow finds hers own strength and faces the future with help from the previous owner of Gull Cottage. Won't scare any little ones if they can stand to watch beautiful black and white classic films that a treat for many of us. A true classic and a great ending. A must own for real classic film collectors."
5,Beatifully acted and performed,"Truly a wonderful adptation. Gene Tierney portrays Lucy Muir fantastically as a strong widow determined not to let anyon use her anymore. Rex Harrison is a perfect Capt. Daniel Greg, hot-tempred yet containing a layer of charm which makes you love him. Best scene; when he wishes her good bye and leans over the bed to whisper his final adieu. He is thisclose to kissing her but doesn't. His restraint is the most romantic thing to make your stomach flip. The ending is a perfect completion to their love."
5,One of the BEST films ever made - Blu-Ray restoration please!,"This is one of those films so worthy of restoration and the Blu-Ray treatment. The Philip Dunne script is amazing - funny, clever, sad, romantic, regretful and powerful. The haunting and romantic music by Bernard Herrmann is my absolute favorite of his from a long list of his movie score triumphs. Tierney & Harrison are at the top of their acting game and there's also little Natalie Wood as Anna and the wonderful directing and time transition sequences by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It's a crime if you haven't seen GAMM. They don't make movies like this anymore."
5,Highly highly recommended.,The product was shipped out immediately. Received within the week of purchase in perfect condition and original packaging. Highly recommend.
5,The chemistry between Gene and Rex made this movie!,"I have seen every movie Gene Tierney has been in and read her biography many times, I am a fan. This is my favorite movie of hers. The chemistry between Gene and Rex is what love is all about."
4,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"I had forgotton what a great romantic, funny and poignant movie this was. It will make a great addition to our monthly ""oldies"" night we host for a few ""oldie"" friends!"
5,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.,I have loved this movie since I was a kid. I am thrilled it is out on DVD. Now my family watches it to.
5,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"This is a good movie. Gene Tierney is perfectly cast for this story, and Rex Harrison does a wonderful job in his role as the ghost of Gull Cottage, where Tierney goes to live with her daughter after the death of her husband. Highly recommend."
5,Love the movie!,This was always one of my favorite movies. I had not seen it for many years and it still passes the test of time. Great movie!
5,The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"The ever-talented Mankiewicz's deeply romantic ""Mrs. Muir"" is pure Hollywood fantasy, driven by the entrancing presence of its two fabulous co-stars. While a love story between a gruff dead seaman given to salty turns of phrase and a gorgeous grieving mother might sound a bit hokey, the chemistry between Tierney (radiant as ever) and Harrison (quite dashing as an unapologetic man's man) is not only credible but winning. Worlds better than its `70s TV spinoff and heartier than latter-day imitations like 1990's ""Ghost,"" this is one cinematic haunted house you should be sure to visit."
5,Ghostly passion,"What a beautiful love story! Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison are marvelous as two people who eventually find love under the rarest of circumstances. I could view this over and over. George Sanders is also excellent as a scoundrel and a cheat who breaks the heart of the heroine [ Gene Tireney]. It does not contain any nudity, foul language pr violenece- just a simple love story. You'll love it!"
5,Enchanting,"What an enchanting movie. From start to finish, I was enthralled with it. I didn't know what to expect upon first viewing but was drawn in as a casual fan of the beautiful & enigmatic Gene Tierney and was beyond pleasantly surpised. Try mesmerized. This has since become one of my favorite movies.The choice of Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison was inspired and could not have been more suitable, more right. I loved the chemistry between these two. The movie is also graced with a wonderful ambience boosted by a perfect score, lighting and direction. It is truly one of the most endearing and enchanting love stories put to film. Can you tell---I love this movie!"
3,Classic Diana Palmer,"I liked the struggle between the characters. They were not only fighting their attraction to each other, but also internal battles regarding their own identity issues. The book is set in the early 1900s, when women did not have the right to vote and were very stifled in their liberties, as well as a time when Native Americans were treated as 2nd class citizens or worse. The hero is a full blooded Sioux who is living in Chicago and has not told a single soul his truth.It's a nice book from Diana Palmer, but it didn't really capture my attention. A lot of emphasis was placed on Nell and her story arc as compared to Matt and Tess. It overshadowed them. It's just recently been re-released."
3,Savage Heart,Usual Palmer storyline and characters. Love overcomes all. Not a bad read at all. I will keep on buying her books.
4,A wonderfully inventive book that kept me going.,I could not put this book down for anything. It was funny how Diana Palmer made her characters act and behave. The twist in plots kept me interested until the end. I loved this book.
4,great safety sun glasses for small faces,"I have a small face, wear child sized glasses in my prescription eye wear.I needed safety glasses for work, and most were so large they hurt rubbing on my ears. these fit well, the side ear pieces adjust a bit so get a better fit. can wear them all day no problem. light weight"
2,Not very comfortable,"They did not fit my head, they where way to big, and i have a medium-large head. Also not very comfortable."
5,Delicate Balance between the Two Subjects,"This book was developed for a class taught at Rice University that covered both Functional Analysis and Probablity/Statistics. It required the development of this book that gives a good introduction to functional analysis for statisticians and an introduction to statistics for functional analysts.The book is positioned so that it can be used for both groups of students. This is a delicate balance that can teach introductions (graduate student level) to both fields without leaving the other half of the class bored. As such it is not a text on either subject, but is inbetween. The sections on statistics are written from a viewpoint familiar to the functional analyst, not from that of a mathematician. And the reverse is true in the sections on functional analysis. This is to complete the view of the two groups typically taking the class.This is a graduate level course, it provides relatively little background information to the basic mathematics needed."
2,Non stick?,"I've used up two of these. When new they are fantastic, but... After a years intensive use for stir-frying, making pasta sauces, etc. the non-stick coating wears away even when scrupulous use of non abrasive tools such as bamboo or non-metallic tools. I found that my old cast iron chicken fryer, that is well seasoned works just as well and it has lasted at least 60 years."
4,great size,"I love the size - very versatile for cooking for a family of 4. It's starting to chip after 4 years of heavy usage. Not bad, I guess."
4,Really good Pot!!!!!,Well I can hardly gush over a piece of cookware can I? It is however made very well. I use it with an insert to steam veggies. The glass lid fits quite snug and allows me to see 'what's cookin'. The price I paid make it qu8irw sweet.
2,Sharp edges!,"Though I absolutely loved the size, shape and heft of this saucepan, I had to return it because the edges of the rim of the pan were dangerously sharp."
1,DOA,The pan looked great but was full of gauges that exposed the shiny metal underneath.I shipped it back today and I'm waiting on my refund.
5,Exactly as expected!,"I love it! Great price, came quickly and matches the rest of my cookware! I was very happy with my purchase!"
3,Be very careful,"Too expensive. But, be very careful when placing on stove, especially gas which has an open grill. The handle is as heavy as the pot and mine has tipped over a couple of times. Make sure you have enough ingredients in pan to prevent this.Not worth the money."
1,Warped rim,"While I like the shape and size of this pan, I have just received the 2nd one in a row with a warped rim so the lid does not fit correctly. I will send it back for a refund this time."
5,Perfect size,I love Cuisinart products. This one is especially useful because it's size is perfect for us. The shape also adds to even cooking.I would buy another just to have it.
1,I took it back,"I found this printer to be frustrating and unresponsive. The scan feature worked all right, but the printer itself had lots of trouble communicating with my Gateway computer. It got stuck as much as it printed. I would never recommend this product, though I find HP to be generally reliable and a quality product. I think this one fell through the cracks."
3,Taras Bulba,"I first saw this when I was ten years old. I was at home one day, sick with the flu, watching TV. This movie came on and I loved it! I fell in love with Tony Curtis, and I thought this movie was SO ROMANTIC! That beautiful music played over and over in my head for a long time! I was furious with Yul Brynner for shooting Tony!!! I was upset for weeks that Tony had to die like that! I watched it again the other day for the first time in forty years....All I can say is...in my defense, the first time I saw it, I was a silly, romantic kid, and obviously out of my head with fever or SOMETHING! The scenery in the film is wonderful...the music is lovely...But let's just say, it did not do for me what it did when I was ten!I am glad I bought it, though, and watched it again...just to relive a little part of my childhood. I still like Tony! Say what you will about him...he WAS gorgeous!"
5,Taras Bulba,"Both Tony Curtis and Yul Brynner put in a great acting performance in this action film. Very interesting plot, plenty of villains and heroes and great action scenes. Rolling landscape and very cool costumes! This is considered to be a classic with good reason. This gets a strong recommendation for my money."
5,Excellent product & good service,"I am totally happy with this product and the person I ordered it from. Came in excellent quality and on time, too. I highly recommend buying from this person. Thanks."
1,Stick with Darkwing Duck,"After being taken in by other reviews, I was disappointed to find this a very thin plot and rather poorly executed drama. I couldn't much care for the downtrodden Cossacks or allegedly dastardly Poles... Stick with the same named character ""Taurus Bulba""... from the Darkwing Duck CartoonDarkwing Duck, Volume 1!"
3,One of the Better Early-60's Epics,"This film got lots of publicity when it came out; I even had a comic-book version of it. It has stood up to the test of time better than some, but still has some quaint aspects: no blood or gore in the vast battle scenes. Historical inaccuracies abound (what are the Polish nobles doing in an Orthodox church?), and the irony of a good Jewish boy like Tony Curtis playing a cossack shouldn't be missed."
3,Yul Nostalgic Remembrance,My family is Ukrainian and I saw this movie at Lowe's Theater in DC on the 'Wide Screen' when I was a kid and mainly remembered the 'battle scene at the cliffs in the end' so when I saw this on Amazon I purchased it to see it in full again - Love that Yul Brynner Baldie and cutie Tony Curtis....
4,some what true but the poles never had an empire,"worked very well and no problems, the movie was ok but cheseier then i remember! baseline story was good.Enjoy it thought."
3,A Good Historical Adventure Film,"The historical aspects of the film were interesting and informative. Yul Brenner's acting was superb; however, Tony Curtis was too into himself and did not do a good job in this role. The young actress playing the Polish daughter, was very good."
2,Taras Bulba,"I was very disappointed with this movie, seemed more like a musical than medieval movie. I wish i would have known before ordering"
3,Anamorphic or Enhanced for Widescreen Televisions,"I cannot tell from the format information as to whether Taras Bulba which was released today is anamorphic or enhanced for widescreen. If it is not then I would recommend not buying it. If anyone has checked this out, please post a review indicating whether it is anamorphic. Thanks."
2,Are you sure Gogol wrote this?!,"It's hard to believe this formulaic story was based on Nikolai Gogol's story. The writers took liberties to turn it into something Hollywoodlandish. And the producers went and hired an unimaginative director to shape it.Russian-born Yul Brynner played (with his usual intensity) a Cossak detemined to fight off the Polish overlords. Tony Curtis (with his usual quiet style) played the eldest son who has divided loyalties since falling in love with a young beauty of Polish nobility (the winsome German actress Christine Kauffman who would marry Curtis -- and divorce him after about 3 or 4 years).I found this pretty boring with the only relief provided by Christine's beauty -- however she has almost nothing to do.The score by Franz Waxman received an Oscar nomination. The location shooting was on the ""steppes"" of Argentina."
3,MOVIE DELIVERY,THE MOVIE WAS OK BUT WHY DID I PAY FOR EXPEDITED DELIVERY AND STILL HAVE THE PRODUCT LATE (AFTER FATHERS DAY) WHEN I COULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT AT THE LOW DELIVERY RATE AND RECIEVED IT AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME?? NOT REAL COST EFFECTIVE...
5,A Spectacular epic of 16th Century Ukraine,"One of the most spectacular films ever captured on film (adequately represented in the original widescreen format). ""Taras Bulba"" is a tale about the Omanski Cossacks and their battle to reclaim the Steppes from the Poles. One of Yul Brynners finest roles, and includes a much sought after, riveting soundtrack by Franz Waxman."
1,Garbage,"The movie is good, but this DVD was taken from a well used VSH tape. The video quality is poor. The audio is worse. I am glad that I didn't buy it and rented it instead. Wait for the restoration. That is if the film is available to restore."
3,Australian Blu-Ray release,"The blu-ray version of TARAS BULBA is a 1080p transfer of the print used for the MGM/UA dvd release. The colors and clarity are an improvement over the dvd, but sadly, it contains only the monaural version of the soundtrack. The standard dvd contains a rich, matrixed, stereophonic version of the soundtrack taken from the 70mm blowups, and because Franz Waxman's bold, terrific score is the real highlight of the picture, the DVD remains the best screening experience, inspite of a slightly lesser visual appeal."
1,Poor quality DVD,"Rousing moving, but they seem to have copied it from a VCR that was watched 50 times too many. Yul Brenner is a marvel in this movie, even with poor quality color and definition."
4,Good scientific treatise on stream management,"This is a very good, but old, treatise on stream management. I found it an excellent addition to my flyfishing library. Quite technical, college-type disertation. Not for everyone."
5,Unexpectedly good,"I read this by accident, but found it to be remarkably good. It is a light read that just sucks you in. I loved Michael and Ashley's relationship and their misadventures on the cruise ship. It was so obvious that they loved each other and the sexual tension just seeps through the pages. The cruise ship activities keep the action going and make the book a pleasure to read. Exactly what you expect a romantic comedy to be :)"
4,Radiosity: A reviewer's perspective,"This book was a wonderful introduction to radiosity theory and practice. There are a fair number of errata in the book, and the code doesn't quite work ""as is"", however, it presents all the information, and most of the algorithms in a clear, explanatory manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a small background in graphics and C+"
2,Well-written but outdated,"I haven't read very much of this book, but the very first code that I typed in from this book had compile errors. I went to a C++ forum asking what was wrong and I found out that the code is outdated. While there wasn't very much wrong with the code, the fact that all of the code in this book will have errors isn't comforting.Aside from that, I enjoyed reading it and I really wish the code wasn't outdated. Maybe I'll still try to learn from it but correct whatever is wrong with the code. Luckily, I have 2 other C++ books that I can learn from, and I'm going to buy another one as well (since this one has problems)."
5,Great book for programming newbies!,"I originally read this book 3 years ago when I was just starting out. The whole concept of the book makes learning to program a fun experience. It is still on the top of my list of ""best intro to programming books"" of all time."
5,An absolute collectable,"I had heard of this book after it was out of print, and searched bookstores all over North America for it. When I did find a copy and read it, I wasn't disappointed. Personally, this is by far the most fun I've had in my programming career. Not only is this a fun book, but also it readily dispenses an amazing amount of information for the beginner, or any programmer who has stayed away from the O-O paradigm out of confusion. If more technical writers wrote as well as Jeffrey Cogswell, we'd have many more talented analysts and technologists. Even for a pro, it's a treat to have in the library. Thanks, Jeffrey. This book belongs back in print. And, even if you don't want it for yourself, give it to a young one. They'll learn more from this book than from hours in a classroom setting."
4,Good book for photographers looking to go beyond 'ordinary',"Galen presents a very honest and enlightening account of his approach to photography. Two things would make the book 5 stars: 1) He mentions taking photos of people as much as those of landscapes but the book has few people photos (photos not quite matching text). 2) His best insights (like the angle of the sun required to see rainbows or really green grass) are too sparse in the book.Overall, this is a very good book and it seems to me those who think Galen is off in his own ego have no better way to compare Galens talents to their own."
5,Great Book,It's a great book ! you'll find all you need about photographing up in the mountains ! Galan Rowell was a great person ! A book worth reading by anybody who enjoys photography at high altitude.
5,Excellent Book,"I bought this book as a gift for a friend. Before giving it to him, I read it. It is a classic and belongs in every photographers collection of ""must have"" books."
5,Galen Rowell-the man,You don't so much review a Galen Rowell publication as you genuflect. Most of the good speakers I've encountered in classes worked with the man and have never lost the thrill. I just wish his wife had been a better pilot.
5,Practical and inspirational: an unsurpassed primer.,"Like Galen Rowell, I am a professional photographer specialising in landscape and mountain subjects. Also like him, I am what is sometimes called `self-taught'- which, of course, means we never took college courses in photography, but have learned from many people, both in person and from books. (Has there been a genuinely self-taught photographer since Fox Talbot?) In my case, one of the most- perhaps the most- significant books has been `Mountain Light'. There are other photographers who are as good as Galen Rowell, but very few who can write so clearly and illuminatingly about the creative and technical processes involved. Ansel Adams, of course, is the towering exception, but he was principally concerned with black and white large format photography. Galen Rowell speaks directly to those who work in colour and with smaller cameras. Adams is essential reading, but so is Galen Rowell."
2,This book was a huge disappointment.,"This beautifully illustrated book is an ode to Rowell's favorite subject, himself. Rowell does not miss an opportunity to remind us of his talent and cleverness, rather than allowing the photographs to speak for themselves. Secondary to this self-indulgence are Rowell's superb pictures (only the few photos showing none other than Rowell himself in the ubiquitous ""conqueror"" pose miss the mark). Unfortunately, the ego-building text detracts from the photographs' beauty, and the book as a whole. Get this book only if you like looking at pretty pictures."
5,A front row seat to the show!,"Great live cd's are rare birds indeed. Only a few bands have managed to capture the magic of their live performances. Well, Pet Shop Boys have made their ""Live at Budokan"" and it's an instant classic. At least for PSB fans.The track listing is a kitchen sink mix of old and new and everything in-between. There are nice surprises too: a live band that includes a small orchestra, guest singers (Rufus and Robbie make the songs sound as if they were written for them to sing), and Neil speaking casually with the audience as if it's a get-together at his home. Very intimate.The production is flawless (another success for Trevor Horn who, if there ever were a third member of the band, he is it) with every instrument and vocal coming through richly and warmly. I can close my eyes and suddenly find myself sitting in the front row and I've got the best seat in the house.Listening to Concrete is, to put it simply, an experience. It's the next best thing to being there!"
5,The Boys are back in Town,"This 2CD live album features Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe at their ultimate best. The most amazing thing about this album is the inclusion of the BBC Concert Orchestra, as well as the diverse selection of material - from PSB's early hits (e.g. West End Girls) to their recent successful Fudamental album (Luna Park, Casanova in hell and Indefinite leave to remain), and also including 'Friendly Fire' (from their efforts at writing a musical) and 'After All' from their soundtrack to Battleship Potemkin; this album is a must-have for fans old and new of the famous duo. The featured guest artists are Rufus Wainright, Frances Barber and Robbie Williams, who also add a touch of class to the evening. I hope that this concert will be released on DVD soon, it would make for great repeated viewing!"
2,my least favourite since '91,"This has very little dazzling guitar work from RT. His publicist certainly wanted to make his money by proclaiming: ""Best work yet""! ""RT is back and better than ever""! I hear none of that in this cd. This is the type of RT cd if you are trying to get your girlfriend to appreciate him and she has been turned off by all the guitar oriented dark melancholy songs of his - give this one a try. It reminds me of the RT cd you would put on in the background while chatting w/ others. if I want an epic guitar workout or storytelling-like songwriting I never put this one on for that."
5,Loved This Richard Thompson Album Too,"I tend to enjoy anything Richard Thompson does and this album is no exception. Yes, it is mainly acoustic but the recording is lush and colorful. Richard doesn't make a bad album and the songs are very insightful and interesting."
2,Not Richard's best,"Been a huge RT fan for decades with all of his solo work, Fairport etc. This is way below average with perhaps 1 excellent cut, 2-3 decent and the rest below average. For new fans, look elsewhere (almost anywhere) for better examples of his typical brilliance."
2,less than his best.....,"I forgave his previous cd (1000 Years of Popular Music)but this is a disappointment. I was hoping this was a case ""of the more I listened,the better it would get"" but that was not to be. It drags along without a single memorable cut to its credit.I've appreciated his guitar work for years but have grown to expect much more that this cd offers. It is not reflective of the Richard Thompson I revere. If you're new to this artist, you'd be better off listening ""Watching the Dark"". ""The Old Kit Bag"" was a much better effort."
2,Two thumbs doon,"Ach! T'were pipin' music I were wantin', not ELO does ""Rebel Piper"". I mean, disco bagpipes? Good lord. Yes, the cheap-hotel-lounge-rock-band backups were grim indeed; the full orchestra numbers weren't much better. In fact, the only reason I didn't give this one star was because a (very) few of the selections weren't TOO bad.Unless you want Highland/Second-rate Hollywood fusion, then avoid this gobbler at all costs."
5,Satisfied in SC,"A friend of ours in PA. play this CD when we were up for the Holidays. If you really like good Bag Pipe music, this is a really good one.........."
4,Highland Cathedral - Pipes and Drums,"I like it, up lifting, and exciting music. Dont like two of the tracks much with horns and band, but thats ok."
3,Yawn...,"The tracks that are worth listening to on this CD are done far better on their more recent CD, ""Parallel Tracks."" Why they bothered with arranging the Titanic theme is beyond me... Not a bad CD, but they've done better."
2,Ouch !!!,"OK, I understand the pipes can be a little dodgy when it comes to playing in tune, but come on this was just plain excruciating. All of the higher tones were absolutely painful. I held my electronic tuner up to the speaker and we are talking a full quarter tone out. This is not acceptable and more than a little embarassing. My wife is no big fan of pipes and after suffering through this mess, I can see why."
5,Great Treadmill!,This is a great treadmill! It is very easy on the knees & has a great walking bed on it. I have extreme RA & I am able to uss this with no problems.
5,Great machine,"Our last attempt at physical fitness was with an stationary bike. After an initial flurry of activity, it became an expensive clothes rack. We have had the treadmill for two months. I cannot explain it, but we use it regularly. The machine has functioned perfectly, except for the pulse monitor, which is not at all accurate. The various exercise programs make working out efficient and offer variety. Hopefully our resolve to get fit will give this fine machine an endurance test over the course of time. We cannot say that we put much strain on it, since we are relatively small people and we tend to do power walking rather than running.The treadmill was shipped promptly and arrived quickly. The assembly took about 1 1/2 hours. Oh, and if a clothes rack is needed, it functions much better than the bike for that purpose. A machine made in heaven."
3,Smooth honors their lifetime frame warranty,"The wife ordered the Smooth 5.25 back in August '05. Late last year, Oct. '10, the incline stopped working. Due to laziness, I didn't check into it until Jan. of this year, '11. I took the top cover off and discovered the mounting bracket for the incline ball screw motor had ripped from the front square cross tube lateral frame support where it was mounted. The weld on the mounting bracket did not fail as I would have thought, the actual tube steel failed all around the mounting bracket. After several phone calls with Smooth Fitness customer service and emailing pictures of the failure, Smooth replaced the 5.25 with the newer 5.65 approx. 3 weeks later. S+H was free as well. I had to be persistent to get action but they did honor their warranty and I received a free replacement treadmill. The 5.25 still works minus the incline which I will work with my father in law and welding machine to fix. Smooth did not want the old treadmill back."
3,Not Built to Last,"I have owned a Smooth 5.0 for about 4 years. Even though the motor is warranted for life, it isn't the motor that goes out and renders the treadmill useless - it is the console. When it went out the first time, the TM was under warrantee and the company sent someone to fix it. The second time they sent me the part and only charged me about [...]. After 4 years they no longer carry the part for this model, so they referred me to [...'. Treadmill Dr. also did not have the part and they recommended a generic part, but the cost was [...]!!! I didn't pay almost [..]to have to put this kind of money into it every few years. I junked the Smooth treadmill and bought a used Proform. Time will tell with that, but a least I didn't put out that much money!"
4,"Bought it for ""We're going on a bear hunt""","The track ""We're going on a bear hunt"" is enough to make it worth buying the CD. My 2 year old LOVES it! Not so much the other tracks although I have to say we might enjoy it more once we have a chance to listen to it more often (besides the favorite track we keep playing on and on!)."
5,This one is priceless !,"This is the BEST CD for children that I have ever found. From the moment it starts, the children jump into action. The movement instructions are easy to follow and the music is infectious ! It is a MUST HAVE for everyone working with young children."
3,ViewSonic Lacks Intuitive Controls,"ViewSonic products are reliable and present sharp images. They are basically computer monitors turned into TV's. If you want to work on your computer and watch TV at the same time, it's a great solution. If you want a TV only, not so good. Controls and menus are not intuitive and quickly become bothersome. The major TV manufacturers have been incorporating consumer input for many years and their operating systems reflect this experience. Better to buy a Sony, Sharp or Samsung."
5,Great Hip hop,"Wow this cd is amazing. If you never heard of J5 then buy this cd and the rest of there stuff right away. There style of hip hop is time less, and this cd totally proves it. So buy this cd right away"
1,Print Perfect Clipart Deluxe,"I sent a review but you did not Print it,so a new review ( this Program is a wast of space on my computer )and a wast of time Thank you all at Amazon."
4,Good map,"This is a very well labeled and accurate map, definitely a good companion for a trip to San Francisco. My main complaint is that it doesn't go all the way to the west coast of the city, which would be an easy expansion. This map will be sufficient if you're only covering the center of the city, but if you're going further, to the Legion of Honor area, etc, you will need to supplement it."
3,Surprising,I haven't heard this whole Cd but the music is actually surprisingly good. How christian music can also be metal is a good question and I certainly hope these artists are true to their word about being christians...
4,"Great book, but ends abruptly","I really enjoyed this book about raising and observing a great horned owl. However, I was disappointed by the ending. Most of the book is about 2 summers and then in approximately one paragraph he sums up an entire year. Was there nothing to write about Bubo's last winter with him? I noticed that this is an's abridged edition. I wonder what was left out?"
3,One of my better purchases,"While it will not become one of my ""go to"" references, this book has a lot of good information within its covers. My big complaint is that the recipes are not in baker's per-cent, and I have to calculate that for myself when I find a recipe I want to use. Otherwise the book has a lot of good ideas and idea starting pictures of cakes to foster my need for inspiration. This will not be sold as a used book during my lifetime. I have already entered between ten and twelve of the recipes into my copy of the ChefTec program, which I think Amazon should also sell. ([...])"
4,serious bakers only,"This book is not for someone who just likes to follow a recipe and be done. Every since I was 12 years old I have read my new cookbooks before attempting a recipe. This book gives me what I have been looking for years, science behind what makes the recipes work. If you are not one to care about what makes the cake work this book is not for you, just stick Betty Crocker and better homes and gardens."
4,The Cake Bible,I never received the book. I waited and waited and finally called the company that I was purchasing it from and got a refund. They refunded my money quickly but I think I rather make my purchases from stores locally.It's a great book.The information and instructions are very good.
3,"If you are a home-baker, do not buy this book.","This book is too sensitive and too cautious in everything. It's kind of a good book for a professional baker, but not for a home baker. I know baking is science and accuracy matters all the time. but NOT this much. Give me a break."
1,"This IS a joke, right...?","6 raw egg yolks, in 'buttercream frosting'? Ewwwww :( I don't know what the intent is here, but this book isn't something I will use for recipes. There is good reference information in here, so it's not a total loss. Good thing I bought it used, for 80 cents; or I would be screaming. Y U C K."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this cookbook,"This is my very favorite one and only cake cookbook. My only wish is that the binding were better.Until I purchased this cookbook over 20 yrs ago, I never had a cake turn out well. With this cookbook, I can do no wrong. The instructions are detailed and easy to follow. I will be purchasing another copy as the current copy I possess is falling apart."
4,Good to a point,I have loved this cookbook for the most part. I think I have gotten to accustomed to the shiny full color pages in other books I own. This only has a section of pictures in color. The rest are printed recipes. It's good information and I am grateful to have this book with so many new things to try. I just wish it were in a nicer format.
2,Dry Dry Dry,"I have used this book since it came out. Every time the result has been a very, very dry cake. At first I thought it was me. But after all these years I doubt it. Particularly when I ignore the book and go back to the old fashioned ""cream butter, suger and eggs"" as opposed to their aerated flour method."
5,Beautiful,I originally picked this book up because the photos were so beautiful. Then I made the Chocolate Oblivion Torte with Rasberry Sauce. If you are a picky chocoholic this is for you. The torte was amazing and the rasberry sauce held all the joys of a summer afternoon. Recently I whipped up a batch of simple meringues using her guidelines....my guests commented on how light & beautiful they were...imagine if I made them when it wasn't raining.
3,Professional Pastry Chef,"I have owned this book for years and have refered back to it many times, the problem is that it becomes very confusing if you try to incorperate her advice in with what you are already doing. It seems that the only way most of her ideas work is if you from start to finish only follow her recipes. And what's with the ""Rose factor"" any one who has this book knows what I am talking about. There are definitely some great pieces of advice and nice little stories but all in all not my favorite."
1,I'll Pass!,"I had been baking for some time when I bought this book. The cakes I made came out dry, although I was careful when following directions. The real disaster was the buttercream which a) used a ridiculous amount of butter, and b) iced my cake, the plate and then the countertop! It just did not set up at all. I think I'll find another source for cakemaking - like Kaufeehaus!"
3,Recipes too sweet !!!,"I have tried a couple of recipes from the book, including the pound cake and the strusel coffee cake. I have found her recipes to be too sweet for my tastes."
2,Also had a chocolate cake from this recipe BOMB.,"I had the same experience as the reader from California who made some awful chocolate cakes from this book. I too could not believe it when I followed the instructions to a T, using expensive Dutch process cocoa and *tons* of butter, and wound up with a heavy, dry cake! On one occasion, my son's birthday, I rushed to the store and bought a Pillsbury cake mix on sale for $.79. Whipped it up, added canned frosting...and got tons of compliments on it.Still, I'm willing to give this book another shot...it must have some redeeming recipes!"
4,The Cake Bible,A wonderful addition to any baker's Library.The book came very well packaged and in excellent condition.Am very satisfied with product
1,Three tries and you're out!,"I won't repeat what all the others that gave this book one star said. Please, read their reviews.I followed these recipes to the letter: weighing ingredients, babysitting the cakes in the oven so I wouldn't overbake them, pan size, etc etc.I have tried the yellow cake recipe twice and the devil's food cake recipe once.All three times the cake was dry.The texture is terrible.And the flavor is... lacking.Don't waste your money unless you're prepared to put a lot of time and effort into these recipes as well as $$$ into high end ingredients."
3,"Nice book, dry cakes","The explanations, details, and pictures in the book are nice. The index is lacking.The recipes are unique, gourmet and contain fairly good instructions. I have been baking cakes for 20 years and am known for my delicious cakes. Every single cake I have made from the Cake Bible has been dry and hardly worthy of eating. The author has expensive tastes and many ingredients and equipment will need to be purchased at specialty stores or online. I use my digital scale and buy the highest quality ingredients and follow the instructions exactly, and still the cakes are not perfect. I will go back to my old recipes, which turn out better even when using measuring cups and subsituting ingredients. Each cake has been a frustrating experience and it's even more frustrating when you consider the cake pans and expensive ingredients I purchased just for this book."
3,"Despite diligent care in following steps, cakes were a bit DRY","I found the section on the science of baking to be invaluable and refer to it constantly. However, overall, there weren't enough recipes to justify the cost of the book. In addition, I tried 4 recipes and they were all too dry (even with all the butter that her recipes call for, which made the cakes extremely tender). The ""dry"" feel is the type where you can't take a bite of cake without needing to take a gulp of milk or other liquid. I used a digital scale, since I do think it produces more accurate results, so I don't think it was a measuring error on my part. I also use various thermometers to make sure my oven is at the right temperature. A book with moister recipes seems to be the Carol Walters Great Cakes book--I loved the Absolutely Best Yellow Cake recipe."
5,Great instructional cake book,I wanted a book that gave me the science behind the baking of a cake. This book does that. I am glad I bought it. Would buy it again. And will purchase her other cake book soon.
4,star book,"This is one of those learning books. I have learned so much about the science of baking a cake! Watch out Alton Brown! Seriously, if your are very interested in everything about cakes this is the book for you. The only reason I gave is four stars is because most of the recipes I tried weren't phenomenal. She makes them sound sooo good, but I wasn't blown away. I do, however love this book, only because it has taught me everything I know about cakes, and has helped me develop my own recipes!"
5,The Bible for all Cakes!!,"I love this book from the moment I laid eyes on it. It became really useful during my days of culinary school. The recipes are very detailed and many of them include pictures of the finished product. If you are serious about baking, this is the book for you!!"
4,A very handy book.,My wife enjoyed this book. It really honors its name of The Cake Bible. She recommended it even for beginners like herself.
4,A good source book!,"I have only used this a few times- when I wanted to make a specific cake and could not find the recipe in one of my favorite cookbooks. It covers everything - but the recipes aren't ar rich as some of my other books.I figure, If you are going to eat cake- the richer the better... Though not everyone agrees- This book does cover the subject well and the recipes can be modified to taste."
5,Delicious sour cream coffee cake,"I am a college student, and a new baker. I tried my first coffee cake from this book, the sour cream coffee cake with streusal filling, with the optional slices of apple, and it came out wonderful! It was so moist, buttery, tender, melt-in-your mouth, and not too sweet. It was so good freshly baked, and also good warmed the next day. The directions are very clear, which I needed, and the ingredients list is explicit. I did not substitute, but used quality ingredients. My family loved it, even those that didn't like cake. It's very tender, so let it cool a bit before attempting to move it!I also just made the lemon curd, which was very, very good! It looks so beautiful, and tastes so fresh. I never made lemon curd before, but the directions were explicit, and the eggs did not curdle at all. It is really yummy, tart, and not too sugary."
4,"Great Recipes, But No Pictures!","I bought this book as a gift for my wife along with Rose's Heavenly Cakes.I have noticed that even though this book contains more recipes than the later, it is being used a lot less than Rose's Heavenly Cakes. I think the main reason is presentation of the book... the bland print and the lack of pictures have let this book down slightly despite the many great recipes that are in this book. This was rectified in the later book which followed this one and has greatly helped.Just purely based on the recipes, this book should receive a solid five, but due to the slightly less than captivating presentation and look of the book on the inside, it gets a four.I think if they ever put out a new edition of this book they should definitely beef it up with better print and pictures. Like so many chefs always say, whenever we are served a plate of food, we eat with our eyes first and then with our pallets."
5,Can't I rate it 1000?,"I bought this book many years ago...and it's still my FAVORITE. No matter how many books I buy or read on the subject, there is nothing that can possibly be compared to this jewel. Really easy to follow instructions, STEP BY STEP, that will make you feel like you were born to be the best baker in the world.I think that Ms. Berambaum background in science gave her an extraordinary perspective: she understands how things must be explained so they can be REPRODUCED. Ms. Berambaum will not only tell you how to but WHY! If your goal is to become a baker that not only produces beautiful cakes but also the most incredible tasting cakes ever baked...this one is for you.(Yes, I am devoted fan!"
2,check it out from the library before you buy,"...I have tried plenty of recipes that have worked before and I know how to follow directions...yet this book is full of recipes that fail. You absolutely cannot substitute under any circumstance, so if you don't want to use flour that is full of chemicals like ""BLEACHED"" flour and you substitute it for a more natural unbleached then you will fail...whats odd is that I have tried other recipes which I could substitute for and work just fine. I know she explains the science about it all... but other recipes seem to be more forgiving/flexible and still taste great using half the time to make. I bought the book based on all the great reviews, but am highly disappointed. Next time I'll just use Julia Child's cookbooks as a reliable source."
4,Answers all your questions about cakes,"This book is an essential if you are the kind of baker who wants to know ""why?"" Covers all the used-to-be essential areas such as altitude as well as useful tips, why mistakes happen and adapting recipes to your personal taste. The back-to-basics contents, such as real buttercreams are without rival. The sections on stabilized whipped cream make the book worth having if for nothing more than that simple recipe and problem solver."
1,the worst recipes,"I bought this book (quite expensive) and was so excited about trying the recipes. I read from beginning to end, and decided these cakes must be awsome. Boy OH BOY! I have been baking for awhile with great results, but these recipes were a disaster. Horribly dry, buttercreams tasted like whipped butter. No matter what liquers you added they still tasted horribly bland. The PERFECT ALL AMERICAN CHOCOLATE CAKE was any but perfect. All I did was waste my time, money, and great ingredients. The cakes were dry dry dry and did I mention BLAND. Even when you added the syrup it was still awfull. I am really suprised to see how many people thought this book was any worth anyone time."
3,"Some helpful tips, but recipes can be overcomplicated","This is a nice book for some understanding how cakes work and how to make good substitutions, but I really don't love the basic recipes. I'd go for America's Test Kitchen Family Baking Book. Fewer cake recipes, but they all work great and taste delicious."
3,More like Just a recipe book,I was not impressed with this book. It is more like just a recipe book to me. I suppose the book is good for making the cakes in it but I would not call it a bible.
3,Not all that I hoped it would be,"I have baked about six or so of the recipes....all of which have been dry and not very good. I have even tried redoing the same recipe in hopes that it was just me that goofed, but again the cakes weren't all that great. The directions are hard to follow and have you flipping around from the cake recipe, to the filling recipe, to the frosting recipe....just to complete one cake. I found that a lot of the ingredients I had to go to gourmet/specialty stores to get them and some got costly. I have been doing cakes for many years for everything from home treats to clients weddings but I would never use this book as my basis."
5,Best Cake Book Ever!!!,"All the recipes are delicious, precise & easy to follow. Add a little imaginative ideas of yours and you'll have cakes perfect for all occasions.Truly the cake bakers' must-haves!!"
4,"Good book overall, but dry cakes","I want to love this book. I really do. Ms. Berenbaum is very thorough in her explanations regarding the science of baking, and her cakes are beautiful. But after trying several of the white and yellow cake recipes (and following them to the letter) my cakes always come out a bit dry. I like the flavor, and they look great, but when I bite into them, they are always dry. Even when I add a generous amount of sugar syrup as indicated. Another thing: the buttercreams always seem to turn out too soft, too squishy to stand up to layering and decorating. At first I thought I was doing it wrong, but I am not new to baking, and now I have tried the same recipes two or three times with the same result: Good look, good flavor, but dry."
5,The Ultimate Authority on Cake,"Like other reviewers, I no longer use cake mixes because this cookbook's recipes are so superb. Perhaps it's not the best cookbook to give somebody with little baking experience, but if you *care* about your cake, this book is the last word.I have never had a recipe from this book fail. I've made two wedding cakes from it with no special skills or experience besides my iron determination. Beranbaum's idea of sweets, however, is sometimes more ""sophisticated"" than what people are used to. For example, I made the flourless chocolate cake for a family gathering. It was seriously awesome (my grandma and I gorged on it until we could eat no more) but it remained largely untouched by the rest of my family, whose idea of awesome cake is the sheet cake covered in crisco roses that you get at the grocery store."
5,the best dessert cookbook I own,The Cake Bible is the most reliable cookbook I have ever encountered. When you are baking a cake it is so important to be able to trust the recipe. Rose Levy Berenbaum's recipes are clear and easy to follow. The methods are fun and innovative and the results are consistantly delicious.
3,"Nice, but lacks content","This is the only Pepsi guide book that I have, and I'm not real happy with it. It is inadequate, hardly scratching the surface of all the Pepsi collectibles out there.As with most other collectibles guides, the back index leaves much to be desired. I guess the author agrees because he omitted it completely. Big mistake.Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of Pepsi guides out there, like there are for Coke. But that doesn't mean this one is the ""bible"" of Pepsi collecting; it doesn't come close. I'm hard-pressed to figure out why others have written such glowing reviews for it.It's pretty, but it's incomplete, the prices are all over the map, there's no back index...but there's very little competition."
4,Good book for IT Governance,"A very good book for IT Governance, although I personally think that could have another structure: less based on articles and more as a book."
4,Ring with a lot of meaning,I bought this ring for a friend and she seemed to really apprecite it. the symbols have a lot of meaning and these rings are passed to people as gifts all over the world.
1,Waste of Money,"The basic design is OK but the execution is shoddy. Countersinks are on the wrong side of tubing. There's no way to mount the top piece as there are no holes in the tubing that supports it. Without being able to rigidly mount the top piece, it is impossible to square the assembly.If Amazon continues marketing this kind of junk, they are going to be losing customers."
4,nice cart,"The only reason this did not get a four star is because there is nothing to keep the wheels from falling off. As soon as it was lifted even to get onto tile from a cement surface all the wheels came off. We put a little calk inside and that seems to have solved the problem. After that, we really like it. The two baskets slide to either side easily."
5,"NOT ONLY IS HE HOT, BUT HE'S GOT TALENT!","The title says it all...not only is Bosson a total hottie, but he's got a great voice! I saw him on tour with Britney and I must say that he brought down the house! I totally recommend getting his hit single ""We Live."""
2,spongebob is still going down the drain,well lets start out bye saying that ever since the spongebob movie i think that the series has gone down hill the new episodes in my opinion SUCKon to the so called 'movie' 1st off it was over hyped to no end you couldn't watch nick without there announcer yelling ATLANTIS SQUARE PANTIS so i decided to watch it...BIG MISTAKE at 1st it seemed ok spongebob finds some hunk of gold and goes to the museum Squidward calls him an idiot then they all get on a bus to atlantis and sing an anoying song about atlantis soon they go on a tour and the plot sort of resembles charlie and the chocolate factory ( charecters get tempted blah blah blah) the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because when they get sucked into an old retro game i couldnt stop laghing overall the verdict is:[...]
3,A good film with pros and cons.,"The 5th season of sponegbob is the worst season. Between the good old days and the farcical new ones.that said, Atlantis Squarepantis is a great film.Pros*Several Episodes*Making of featureCons*NO SCENE SELECT!*The other episodes are quite bad."
4,David Bowie SquarePantis,"My brother's middle child (4 years old) is WILD for Spongebob. She also yells, ""Turn it up!"" everytime I play my David Bowie CD when she's with me. I think it's only appropriate that she get the best of both worlds (even though some adults would argue whether Spongebob is appropriate for young kids at all). This DVD arrived quickly and in excellent shape."
5,Loved it!,"I read about it in the NYTimes and since I've been a Sponge Bob fan since my youngest watched it, I came home and said I was commandeering the tv in the family room for it. I watched it w/my two youngest sons ages 13 and 17 (!!) and we all had a blast. Animation was great. Different styles for different sections. Laugh out loud at Sponge Bob and Patrick. Silly, goofy fun, just as it should be. ""making of"" 15 minutes at end was fun too..."
4,Good transfers,"The numbers on the CD here, were ALL on the 1957 LP as I have a copy. The LP jacketlists the carol medley as Instrumental, but this must be in error, as my copyof the LP has a choral version as heard here. There was an abridged versionof this album on a Pickwick re-issue LP, and also a fake stereo LP on Coralusing the same jacket design. Avoid these re-issues at all cost ! Unless yousee the original mono release. The Pickwick was obviously derived from the fakestereo release which is unbelievably bad. The sound on this CD reflects the originalmono release, thank goodness."
5,If You Are Interested In Prophecy You MUST Read This Book!,"This is the revised 1994 edition, the first copy was written in 1986. In this book Irvin Baxter shows where the U.S., Britain, Germany and Russia are prophecied in scripture. If you like this book I strongly suggest you order his Bible study ""Understanding The Endtimes""."
3,The correct interpretation of 1 Peter 1:20,"The correct interpretation of 1 Peter 1:20, although it is often ignored, is that Peter is actually refering to ""the prophet's own understanding"", meaning that no scripture comes from the understanding of the particular prophet that recieved the message. This passage is not referring in any way to an interpreters understanding of the scripture. Therefore, although this passage is often used to critisize objective, and often times somewhat bizarre interpretations of scripture, both by scholars and the unlearned alike, it is nevertheless applied completely incorrectly. D.L.M"
4,The Purple Barcroft,"OK..so it's not the best of the Republic serials!But it has Roy Barcroft as the ""reptilian monster"" and it has plenty of the Republic furniture-throwing fight scenes and a lot of cliffhanger endings that are resolved with, ""Jump Sheila!"".Just wait until you see how Dennis Moore escapes the closing spike door, using his 4 inch Colt handgun and a wall mounted pay-phone!This escape was inspired!The quality is good and should be put out as a DVD!"
4,For Serial Lovers,"A must for the serial lover, the Purple Monster has what your looking for. It wants to take over Earth. The problem is their space ships can't make the round trip. He wants to build it with help from earthly cohorts that are recruited with a show of technology. You'll need to get it to see if Earth lost the battle.Great serial fare."
1,Cheaply Made With No Imagination,"This is without a doubt one of the dullest, most unimaginative serials I have ever viewed. If you can stay awake past the same old standard fist fight at the end of each chapter then you must be on caffine i-v. There are much better serials than this, spend your money elswhere."
3,Groucho - A man of his time,"At times very funny, Memoirs is an interesting look back into a time when men did everything we do today with women but didn't speak of it. I give Groucho points for somehow finding ways to talk about sex without getting the least bit graphic. It's true that the book can be a bit dull due to the lack of vivid descriptions and some of the stories aren't terribly interesting, but the words and wit of Groucho shine through and it's a fun and brief read. Looks great on Kindle."
2,Has not aged especially well,"While I definitely count myself as a Groucho fan, I was fairly disappointed by this book. By ""has not aged especially well"", I'm referring both to the subject matter (very tame) and the writing style (very dated). Frankly, I wonder if he would be at all surprised that it hasn't aged well: it looks to me as if he dashed it off in a hurry, perhaps for a quick paycheck. I found The Groucho Letters to be a bit better, but it likewise is no side-splitter. Perhaps his best writing was confined to the movies."
5,Classic Rock Album,"Why has nobody gave a rating to this album yet? This one is a must have for everybody who recently discovered Queens Of The Stone Age or Mark Lanegan. Chris Goss is the godfather of stonerrock. This album is the first and in my opinion the best of the MoR albums. The sound is very bluesy and rocks at the same time. The guitar work is strong and groovy. Later albums are also good, but over here Chris has a very solid band. The songs are strong and well worked out. My favourites are Kill the King, John Brown and The eyes of Texas."
5,"Largely Unknown, but GREAT, Album","A friend of mine introduced me to this cassette (has it been that long?) in the summer of '89. How he found out about them I have no idea, but I got back home, found it at NRM (another shout out to how long ago this was), and fell in love with it. I still can't get over how many different genres are referenced on this disc. Other posters have already hit on those, so I won't, but they pull each one off exceptionally well. This disc remains one of my all-time favorites.PS - I would LOVE to get ahold of the ""Blue Garden"" album. I have the reissue, which I am happy with, but I think the original order of songs flowed SO much better."
1,Rip Off,This ring did look real but as soon as my husband got into shower with it on it turned and faded. I feel cheated because no where in the discription did it say that it was not real silver. Do not buy from this seller.Sterling Silver 5 MM Wide Plain Band Ring
5,Very Satisfied,"Just got the ring today and I love it! It's a nice, solid ring without being obtrusive. The band shaping seems a little more convex than that shown in the picture, which I think looks better anyway.Correct size, excellent fit, and came packaged in a cute little gift box. The delivery to Canada was much faster than I expected, with no problems.Overall, I am exceptionally pleased and will be ordering from this company again."
4,You get what you pay for,"Good ring for the price. It was received in excellent condition, but was easily marred during even casual wearing."
5,Simple and Elegant,The ring is perfect for what I wanted -- simple and elegant. The size is perfect for stacking with other band rings.
4,Nice ring,I bought this ring for my husband. It's nice but had to return due to the size. We needed a half size also DH isn't a silver guy.
2,Not Recent vintage,"This cologne appeared to be around for a long time. The fragrance was not very strong. I have purchased other bottles from other sources where the color was almost clear. Where this cologne was a dark yellow. In the future if I cant find out how long ago it was bottled, I will not purchase it again."
5,This is the best of the potato history books.,"Redcliffe Salaman chronicles the history of the potato from prehistory through modern times with the vehemence and passion of a zealot. This book contains a tremendous amount of information about the cultures that have made use of the potato as well as all you could ask about the noble tuber itself, including dietary and cultivation information. Here, in a book about spuds, you'll learn plenty about human nature, the nature of civilizations, and even art."
5,I do whatever the little voices tell me so I LOVED this book,"As an author who frequently has conversations with my characters, Suzanne Brockmann has nailed it with this story.I love love love this book. It's brilliant and funny and tender and sweet.Don't miss it."
5,Terrific Writer-Suzanne Brockmann,"I especially like reading stories from Ms Brockman, They are all about the superheros who lift us above ourselves in what we think we can do to what we really can do if we just put the effort into the project. Since most of her heros are Navy Seals that fits right in with our current political times."
4,A fast paced read....,"Jax Winchester has survived two years in a South American prison to come home and find the woman that he has loved since she was sixteen married to another man. Heartbroken and broken, Jax retreats to his imaginary world of writing where he has relationships and conversations with his characters. Jax is an extremely likable hero who will do anything to convince Kelly that he loves her and has never stopped loving her. It takes a lot more convincing than he orignially thought.Kelly O'Brien has loved and lost with T. Jackson. Not knowing about his time spent in prison, Kelly believes that Jax deserted her when he was tired of her. No matter what Jax tells her, she absolutley will not believe that he loves her and wants to marry her.Letters to Kelly is an extremley emotional book. It is different from Brockmann's other books, but she still gets the emotion across to readers. Some of the letters from Jax to Kelly made me want to cry, they were so sad.A very good read!"
1,just really uncomfortable with the premise,"Up front I will say that I only made it half way through this book because I was so uncomfortable with the premise. The six year older main character falls in love with a 16 year old and acts on it to some extent. I just couldn't deal with the justifications that ""she loves him back""...""he's going to wait until she's older"" etc. It sounded just like all of the child abuse justifications."
2,Doesn't measure up.,"This is an earlier Brockmann work which is just now being issued, and it shows. The story is not nearly up to Ms. Brockmann's current standards. The plot is shaky, and the hero comes across as being rather wimpy. Buy it if you need to have a complete set of Ms. Brockmann's books, but don't expect too much."
3,Either Way He Was A Condemned Man,"So here I sit, writing letters that have no hope of reaching you until I am free to deliver them myself. With luck, that will be soon. For your eighteenth birthday is coming, and I intend to be there, like I promised....For years, a trumped-up charge - and a Central American prison cell - kept Jax Winchester from claiming the girl he loved. Now he was a free man. Or was he?For only the memory of Kelly O'Brien - and the letters he'd composed to her - had kept him going. But once he was released, he knew he was still a prisoner - in a jail of his own making. The way out this time? Keep that promise he'd made to Kelly all those years ago - and claim her for his own...."
2,I didn't get what I ordered,"I bought this movie for my mother-in-law. A woman who's only seen this movie in Spanish and loves it. I checked, and doubled checked this web site to see if it was dubbed and this is what I found ""Dubbed: English, French, Spanish"", but when I got the DVD I couldn't for the life of me find the Spanish dubbing. Not good at all."
5,Funniest Movie Ever,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I ordered it because of my mother.....I have NEVER seen her laugh so hard at any movie.
5,Hilarious!,"At any agae, you have to see this movie. It is absolutely hilarious. I've seen it with my mom, with my kids, and by myself, and I will see it again."
5,baby's day out,My husband recorded this on our DVR a while back. My grandchildren absolutely love it. While there is a little violence (nothing gorey) it all happens to to the slap stick criminals and is done in a way that is funny. Baby Bink always is one step ahead of these would be thugs. Decided I needed the DVD in case we lost out recorded version. Very good price for such fun entertainment.
4,Baby's Day Out,it's very entertaining.lam an adult but l was laughing like crazy. l was also told that there is another one called Baby's Trip to China but l can't find it.
1,Oh Dear God...,"How can people think this is good? Its unrealistic, boring, horrible in a way that cant be described and...well...i simply cannot say enough about this. Watch Mr. Plinkett's review for more info, trust me, everything he says i agree with and couldnt say more![ .. ]Anyone who gave this 5 stars is either delusional or a BIG fan of horrible movies. You people probably liked the spice girls movie, or 'moo on rogue' (and yes, i spelled it wrong on purpose, i hate that movie).Dont buy this, dont let your friends buy this, dont even talk about it. Dear God...-Rich"
2,Not the best acting,"This movie is cute, and that is why I rated it two stars. Otherwise, I would have given it a one. The baby in themovie is not really acting. It is just simply following someone and smiling. The whole theme is just plain dumband stupid. A baby smarter and more durable than it's kiddnappers? HUH?! Who would want to watch some crazy baffoons waddle around with goop sliding down thier noses and arms? I'll tell you what, not me."
5,You have to be a real sourpuss not to laugh at this movie,"A very very funny movie that kids LOVE! I don't get the carping about how derivative it is of Home Alone--it's a riot, so who cares? Certainly not a 7-year-old. There are some cleverly-written bits for grown-ups to appreciate, and some--like all the crotch-centered mishaps--that I could live without, but the kids think they're hilarious. I hate a lot of the bland ""family fare"" films, but this one truly is fun for the whole family. We've watched it dozens of times by now, and there are certain scenes that just never get old."
4,Great funny movie for the family.,"Great acting it's not, but it's a fun and funny movie for the whole family."
2,Baby's Day Out,"This will mostly appeal to very young children or babies. Adults may be slightly bored or appalled watching a baby crawl out windows, through traffic, on skyscrapers, in a Gorillas cage, et cetera. Add in three bumbling idiot kidnappers that get racked between the legs a lot by falling onto things. That's the type of humor you will find in this John Hughes movie that doesn't hold a torch to ""Look Who's Talking"". I love most of Hughes movies but I was disappointed in this one. There are a few light moments but overall it is not something I would sit through again. If you enjoyed this catch ""Andre"" and ""Dr. Doolittle"".CA Luster"
4,Almost as good as The Woman In White...,"I really enjoy Wilkie Collins, and this book did not disappoint. My favorite of his is The Woman in White, but I this book is possibly my second favorite. It truly is a classic. There is a mystery to solve, and there is also a love triangle. But there isn't too much ""schmaltz"" or sweetness in my opinion. It's also a fast read, since it isn't a very long book with unnecessary details."
2,Dull,"This book was dull and slow. I didn't even finish it. I like Victorian novels, but this one failed to attach my interest. Instead of quaint manners and conservative culture it was plain silly."
1,help,one major complaint of most of all the collins classics that I have ordered is that they are not unabridged. It is almost impossible to determine if the book has been edited before it is ordered on line.
1,Never got a framed poster,I never got this poster framed it was a rip off and false advertisingI feel cheated and I paid way too much for thisRegular poster I am seeking a return.
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is absolute drivel. There is no index, no bibliography, no notes, no table of contents, and not even a division of the book into chapters. There is no reference to any scholar, books of the Bible, or any ideas about religion other than the author's belief that Jesus was the son of God. There is nothing to be learned about Jesus, Christianity, or anything else in this author's 300 pages of pietistic self indulgence. Total repetition of useless ""information""."
5,Cost effective shredding,"This shredder is great, especially for the price. Shreds paper and cards well, takes multiple sheets. If you try to do too many sheets at a time and it chokes, reversing fixes the problem. It holds a lot so you don't have to empty it that often. The casters on the bottom are great, it rolls very easily. It won't start if the bin is not completely in place, so it's not possible to get to the main part of the shredding mechanism while it's running, which is a good safety feature. The top slot is too small for adult fingers and the shredding mechanism is set low enough that non-adult fingers would not be able to reach down the feed slot."
1,Stopped working after 3 days,"No good. I used it only once to test how it worked.... then 3 days later when I actually wanted to use it, it was dead... lights out... Still waiting for my refund."
