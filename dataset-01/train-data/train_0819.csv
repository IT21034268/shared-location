2,"Great idea, poor design","I loved the idea of this product for my cereal, but like other reviewers, I found that the product doesn't work as designed. When the ice ring is frozen, the milk cup won't fit inside it, and as a result, the top bowl won't screw into the clear bowl. After the second dish-washing, the milk lid barely fits on the milk cup. Also, the spoon folds in half and won't stay open while you're eating with it (if it would have been designed to fold the opposite way, it would work okay.) Too bad, I'd buy 4 more of these if it worked well."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","This product worked exactly once. After re-freezing the ice ring, it was misshapen and the system would no longer fit together."
2,Great idea that misses the mark,"I was excited to find this for taking my cereal to work. The first day I used it, it worked well. It was hard to get it screwed together tightly so the milk wouldn't leak. The second time I used it, the whole thing came apart in my lunch box. I threw the whole thing away. It wasn't worth the headache of wondering if I would have a mess to clean up. I had better luck putting my milk in a bowl and my cereal in a sandwich bag."
3,"Great idea, but needs a few tweaks","I really love the idea, but there's not enough room for one cup of cereal (unless maybe it's something in small bits like Grape Nuts), and there's too much room for half a cup of milk. The spoon is a little bit funky but certainly easy enough to use and wash. I also find it a little difficult screwing the top bowl off of the bottom bowl -- the threads are a little bit wonky or something. And, it doesn't quite fit together right if you want to forego the ice pack -- the ice packs are pretty essential in the two Fit 'n Fresh containers I got. That said, I still really love cereal with slices of banana, and my few complaints still don't prevent me from using it now and again!"
1,Needs more improvement . . .,"I purchased this item at Target, but will return it. It's marked dishwasher safe (top rack), and ran it before using. True to many other reviews, the plastic isn't top-grade and warped enough that the lids do not fit the containers properly. The smaller bowl is labeled ""water-resistant,"" but after washing, it takes some force to put the lid on and there are still some small leaks. When I stacked the items in order, I discovered that the top container doesn't securely twist onto the bottom bowl and stay put (keep twisting slightly and it'll just come off again). It's a great concept and I would probably purchase this again when they use better plastic and iron-out the issues with securing the lids and twist tops properly."
1,Not what I wanted and miss leading in the ad.,THE AD SAYS TSAR EDT SPRAY COLOGNE.IF YOU READ FURTHER IN THE DISCRIPTION IT STATES IT IS EAU DE COLOGNE (EDC)NOT EDT.THIS IS WHAT I WANTED THE $102.00 EDC TSAR COLOGNE.SO I MADE THE PURCHASE. THE EDC COLOGNE IS A MUCH HIGHER IN COST. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS NOT NOT THE COLOGNE I EXPECTED.FOR $102.00 YOU RIPPED ME OFF FOR A BOTTLE TSAR EDT 3.3 SPRAY EAU DU TOLLIET SPRAY WHICH SELLS NATIONWIDE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF $20 -$45.00 DEPENDING WHO YOU PURCHASE IT FROM.....THE TSAR (EDC) WHICH STANDS FOR EAU DU COLOGNE IS WHAT I EXPECTED AND DID NOT RECEIVE THE RIGHT COLOGNE AS WORDED.
2,Not much for the price.,This laser is at best average. It definately is not worth the higher price they want for it. I have seen keychain lasers that are of better quality and intensity.
5,in-your-face,"Trippy guitars, tribal trums, sonic boom basslines, mixed with the lyrical flow of the barrio underground make up the sound and style of the metal band STUK. Though they have their own style they are often compared to Korn, Slipknot, P.O.D., and the Deftones. Their live show is energetic, gritty, and in-your-face and will make you want to move, dance, & slam."
4,a great thought provoking book,I'm getting married in about a year and a half and thought that this would be a great book to read with my future husband. i found that it took us half an hour or more to answer some of the questions--the questions promoted conversation which led us to other issues not even mentioned in the book. We also felt that we knew each other a little better afterward. It was worth the time and money. This is something that i would definitely buy for my friends when they get married.
2,Questions Not Hard At All,"I agree with the premise of the book, which is that using a book of questions to provoke thought and conversations that a couple may not have thought of on their own or encountered yet can help reveal a lot about the relationship. But, the questions in this book are not hard at all- most of them are obvious and are things you can come up on your own even if someone just gave you the subject of the chapter. There are better question books out there that present a lot more thought-provoking list then this for more in depth conversation then this book would startg. Other reviewers who gave similar ratings already gave plenty of examples of this if you want more detail."
3,"After reading this,book...",Not quite what I needed being married already for 18 years. More for those who are trying to dot every I or cross every T. I did like the mention of; commit to acting loving forever rather than committing to love forever.
3,Too Small,I was looking for a book that would help me and my sweetheart to really get to know each other. I have seen too many couples make terrible mistakes because they really didn't know each other well enough.This book was ok but I felt that there were a lot of questions that needed to be addressed. I searched through all the books and finally found what I was looking for at the website questionsforcouples. com
2,"not so ""hard"" after all","this book is small, and talky. there's a big intro to each section, and then about 5-7 questions for that section. plus, they are pretty juvenile. i have been with my partner for over 2 years, and we are planning a marriage, not deciding to go steady. we wanted hard questions. not ""what if i am ever attracted to someone else"" and ""how many kids do you want"" questions. we went over those ages ago. very good for someone just starting out in the dating world to get an idea of what relationships are really all about. not for the mature couple looking to plan a future."
4,Great Little Book,"I purchased this book for my daughter, who is newly-engaged. Of course, I thumbed through it as soon as it arrived to check it out before giving it to her. I thought it was a great little book! Many thought-provoking questions, asked in a manner so as to promote honest, healthy discussions, rather than incite painful arguments and personal attacks. My husband and I actually went through many of the chapters for ourselves. While we are far from being newly-engaged, we will soon be ""empty-nesters"" and entering a new phase of our our own marriage. Reviewing the questions from that perspective really shed some light in several areas about the years to come for us! Honestly, when the book arrived and I saw how small it was, I didn't have much faith that it would be worth reading. I was pleasantly surprised! Obviously, I would recommend this book not only to young couples, but also those who have been together for a while as well."
2,A very early beginners guide.,"For the most part, I think the questions posed by this book are rather simple, based on common sense, and sometimes even superficial. (For example, ""Are our current combined salaries enough to pay our expenses?"" ""Should we have children together?"" ""Who prepares the meals?"" ""How should we handle sexual expectations?"", etc.) More than half of the book is blank space for the readers to write their answers in, which makes me feel cheated.I think this book could be useful for engaged or pre-engaged couples who've had little relationship experience. The author also shares the story of her relationship and the formation of this book, which I thought was the most interesting part."
2,If you met your future spouse 10 minutes ago...,"If you met your future spouse 10 minutes ago and you're in a cab on the way to the courthouse you may want to look through this book really quick. Baring that, you've hopefully talked about most of this stuff already. This book is super thin, has those annoying rag type pages you can't flip through, and asked the most basic of questions you should have figured out while dating. But again, if you are in that cab, give it a glance."
3,The Hard Questions....,"Very common sense questions, when you think about them, but we may not think to ask them."
3,I don't even remember buying this,I must have been dating a questionable lady when I bought this maybe 7 years ago. Must have for those in doubt.
3,"Good discussion starters, but very secular","This book was interesting, and the questions were a great way to start discussion. Although often we had already talked about the topics, it was still good to cover some of these specifics in preparation for marriage.HOWEVER - I would caution other Christian readers out there that this book is written by an extrememly liberal & secular author. The introduction and chapter intro's tell a very selfish story, about 2 people dating who are looking out for #1, and basically how to set expectations to get what YOU want out of a marriage (Rather than building a partnership as one mind). Also the chapter on sexuality assumes you are already sleeping together and is not appropriate for a couple waiting until marriage."
3,do you really want to know all about the one you love?,This is a good book to find a basic list of questions to think about before you get married or live with someone. There are a few questions that I would not want to know about anyone... let alone someone i will be spending my life with. It gave me some great things to think about asking. The book reminds me of a cosmo quiz.
3,Need More Questions,I found that this book was lacking in dozens if not hundreds of essential questions that should be asked before couples make a lifetime commitment. Most of the questions were good but I had to look elsewhere to find the questions that I knew were lacking.Definitely check out 1000 Questions for Couples.
1,Essential?,"When you get questions like ""What if one of us stopped working?"" and ""Do you want kids?"" then it is far from ""Hard hitting"" or ""Essential"". It takes Susan 128 pages to give a list of 100 questions that could be yanked out of any given teen magazine on any given day of the week. Maybe if I was 12.. then I would have admired the ""hard hitting"" questions. However.. now.. I'll ask all these questions before I'm 2 months into a relationship, let alone getting married! If your compass is awry and you're petrified of talking candidly with your spouse.. this book is for you! If not.. well.. go spend the money on dinner, and you'll actually have a better discussion!"
3,More Please,"As the Disability Host on BellaOnline, I found the book good, but wished it was bigger in size and had more questions. It's a very small book and hard to handle physically."
5,MacKenna's Gold,"This is one of the best westerns ever. Intrigue, mystery, action, beautiful women, and breath taking scenery like no other western I have ever seen. This has got to be Gregory Peck's best western, and Omar Sharif is delightfully and passionately wicked. Julie Newmar is one of the most beautiful women ever, and there is a scene of her swimming in the nude. You see enough that you might want to cover your kid's eyes during that scene. This is a fantastic movie, one that you will want to watch more than once."
1,McKenna's Gold,"As a long time loyal fan of Gregory Peck, this movie does not stand up to his others. The acting is sluggish, the plot predictable, the ending issadly ""corny"". Peck does the best of all the actors and actresses. Camilla Sparv gives a very lukewarm performance. This is definately NOT a family film.Peck fans will find ""Big Country"" as real Western Classic, with all the wonderful music, scenery and excellent story western fans look for."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"I've never seen so much talent and scenery wasted in such a dismal movie. The hokey introduction, bad music, the ""buzzard"" moteif and hokey Indian lore, the absurd ending with the lousy special effects, all combine to make this an embarassment to anyone trying to interest someone in Western films. Even Julie Newmar's skinny diping can't redeem this slow, plodding, too-long film. Many great stars turn out an occassional stinker, and this is Pecks."
2,"Well, I was in 8th grade...","...so what did I know?! I saw this movie when it came out in the theater in '69. I remembered it as being really good....ha! Yes, it is entertaining, but certainly not anything to take the least bit serious. Was it meant to be a comedy?! The cast pops from one locale to another faster than I can get anywhere in a car...one minute Monument Valley, next a wooded Black Hills-lookalike. Next, back in the desert. Those were some fast horses back then. Beautiful Indian gal-with nicely-done makeup and a Wonderbra. Beautiful white girl with nicely done makeup...and beautifully highlighted hair. In summation, what I'm trying to say is this movie is just plain dumb. The soundtracks from almost any movie made in the late 60's and most of the 70's are always hideous, but the ""theme""-although sung very well by Jose Feliciano-was worse than most! Just too funny from start to finish."
3,A western that could only be made in the 60's,"Psychedelic camerawork, panoramic vistas, a Quincy Jones avant garde western score, Atticus Finch himself, Gregory Peck, Dr. Zhivago-Omar Sharif passing himself off as a Mexican bandito, Lurch-Ted Cassidy as an Indian, a pre-Kojak Telly Savalas, and ""My Living Doll/Catwoman"" Julie Newmar make for one of the strangely cast westerns of all time. Add to that the inspired casting of some of the best character actors to ever grace the silver screen (Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Edward G. Robinson, Anthony Gayle, Raymond Massey, Keenan Wynn, Lee J. Cobb, to cite a few, and you have one GROOVY western...long on credits, short on plot, but still worth a look!"
5,MacKenna's Gold,"Excellent scenery throughout the movie, a refreshing movie to watch at any age.Great score of actors."
1,"Terrible, worse than terrible.","I love westerns, westerns with great scenery and westerns with a great cast. All that and Gregory Peck couldn't save this disaster. My wife said it was the worst western she's ever seen. No only that, it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has to be in my bottom five movies of all time. I nominate this ""film"" as the biggest waste of talent in Hollywood history. The scenery was beautiful, but I'd have given it a 0 if I could."
3,Big screen Saturday morning serial for adults,"I remember this being one of my favorite movies in the theatre as a kid, and I always saw it when broadcast on network tv. I've now had a chance to view it as an adult 40 years later. Not being able to see this on widescreen reduces the point of the exercise, so I was fortunate to watch it again on laserdisc.The scenery does grab your attention, but the filmmakers did pile on the post production tricks. Things move along at a breakneck pace at times, just like an old Western serial did, and with the same absurdities. The nude swimming scene and general violence were racy for it's day.If it makes it to Bluray with widecreen restored, it might entertain, but I can't recommend it as highly now compared with others of the Western genre."
4,Good movie,"I enjoyed this one - fastforwarded through parts but overall a good movie. Funny how I knew some of the parts - must have been from watching it as a kid a long time ago (or maybe not). Excellent acting. G.P. is amazing. O.S., and even T.S. were good too. And the babe is nice."
1,"""Old Turkey Buzzard,"" Indeed!","The people who brought you ""The Guns of Navarone"" reunite for a remarkably absurd Western adventure. From the opening strains of José Feliciano's ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" (which became a running gag on ""Late Show with David Letterman"") to the ridiculous climax, director J. Lee Thompson's ""Mackenna's Gold"" remains stunning in its ineptitude. Gregory Peck delivers his best Adam West imitation while an all-star cast appears stranded. One of the worst big-budget Westerns ever made."
1,Lack of Widescreen -- Utter dissappointment!!,A great movie with half the scenery gone. Save your money for a widescreen version.
1,ONLY FULLSCREEN VERSION AVAILABLE?,"This is a brilliant movie. However, be aware, that the version that I was shipped (February 2005) from Amazon.ca, is NOT the version described here. THERE IS NO WIDESCREED VERSION on side 2. There is no side 2. I would check before ordering."
3,Another Sony Reissue Scam,"Three stars for the film, NO stars for Sony.Columbia Pictures released many of its classic films on DVD in double-sided, widescreen & pan-and-scan format. However, after Sony bought out the Columbia film library, it then proceeded to reissue them in SINGLE-SIDE, PAN and SCAN ONLY format WITHOUT CHANGING THE UPC CODE OR FRONT COVER ARTWORK. Mackenna's Gold is only one example of this.So because online DVD sellers cannot separate the two versions by UPC code (and some list the wrong aspect ratio or none at all), people who buy these titles for the widescreen content are cheated. The only way to tell the difference is looking at the back cover AFTER receiving the DVD (and sometimes that's wrong too) or by playing it. This is deceptive practice at its worst.If you're a widescreen fan, beware of any Columbia title released by Sony."
4,A fantasy western about gold fever and greed.,"This is one of those odd Hollywood westerns that almost fits into the ""science fiction"" category. I like everything Gregory Peck has ever done... so I enjoyed the movie. I also liked the music if not the lyrics (Old Turkey Buzzard). The plot doesn't make much sense and could've been better. But this odd movie still qualifies as a classic in my mind."
2,It's just too HARD to tighten!!!,"I had to give the seat a low star rating. There are features that I do like about the seat - easy to clean, roomy, strap height easy to move, cup holder, looks comfortable.BUT every strap on this seat is HARD to tighten!! The strap for the universal anchorage system is basically impossible to tighten once you have it attached. And the harness strap can be very difficult to both tighten and loosen.I've had this seat for about 6 months. It was rear-facing and I hoped that things would get easier once it was forward facing. The only thing that is better is that it is easier to fit in the back seat but the straps are still hard to pull tight.I'm really considering going out and buying a different seat because my elbow is starting to bother me from pulling on those straps! So if I have to do that, this seat was basically a waste of money!!"
5,Great Car Seat,"My daughter is 12 months old and 20 pounds we decided to switch over to a front facing car seat.Went to Target and bought the ""EvenFlo - Generations? Booster Car Seat"". Totally disappointed, My daughters head was not being supported properly when she was taking a nap and the belt adjustment was a pain..as you have to use both your hands on either sides of the seat to loose. Went to Babies R Us and bought this one..Easy to install and daughter much comfortable..and her head rests perfectly when she is taking a nap.."
3,So-So,"I like the look of it. It's easy to get my son in and out in the rear-facing position. But it was hard to install by myself. From the instructions it looked like a snap, but it took over an hour - even with the Latch system. I finally figured out that I had to remove the base in order to install it at the correct ""level.""To those where the car seat doesn't fit ... are you putting the passenger seat all the way forward? That's what I have to do. Granted no one else can ride with us. I'm so tall that my seat it pushed all the way back and the passenger seat is pushed all the way forward. That part I hate!!"
1,Same Review as Colton's Mom,"I bought the Eddie Bauer about a month ago and can't seem to get it tight in the seat (rear facing). The car seat moves from side to side and lifts up off the seat. I have a 01 Ford Taurus that provides ample room. The instructions say it may have some ""play"" but good grief the thing moves over 3"" on each side using the anchors and there is no way to get it tighter. We had the fire dept. check it out and we are returning it to get a different brand. Might have to go with the Britax. The Eddie just doesn't get tight enough. Very dangerous in my opinion."
2,Tough to install,"My husband and I loved this car seat when we saw it in the store. My 9 month old daughter fit in it well and she seemed to like it. When we got home, we tried to install it for an hour. We first tried the middle belt. That belt wouldn't get tight enough. We tried the shoulder belt and the seat tilted so bad that we couldn't use it. We eventually decide to take it back and get a Britax, which has worked out much better."
4,Eddie Bauer Mercer Carseat,"I had a separate infant seat due to that coming with a stroller I had purchased so this seat was for the next step. I enjoy the seat as a whole. The instructions are a little difficult to follow and the clip in between the legs can be difficult at times, but overall this is a great seat and I would recommend it to others."
3,Tightening Nightmare,"My husband and I switched to this seat after our son outgrew his infant seat. In the rear-facing position, it is a pain in the #@$ to install. It involves a lot of sweating.On the positive side, in the forward-facing position, it is much easier to install.The WORST part about this seat is that the straps are difficult to tighten in either position. It seems that you can not get them as snug as you would like.We have to buy a second seat for my husband's truck. Our son is hardly ever in the truck so we are going to buy a new one for my SUV and put this one in the truck.I think I will appreciate it when we can use it as a booster.Andrea Gaynier-Toledo, OH"
1,Harness Straps Keep Twisting,"My wife and I each have seat in our car for carrying our 18-month-old toddler. She has a Britax Marathon convertible car seat. I have a Cosco Eddie Bauer Deluxe 3-in-1 car seat. Neither of us has had any problems using the Britax seat with thick harness straps that don't twist. The lap-buckle system on the Britax harness is easy to use and can be undone with one hand. The seat cover was also easy to remove when my daughter spilled juice all over her seat. In contrast, within 2 weeks using the Cosco seat and wrestling my toddler into the harness, the thin harness straps on my Cosco seat were a twisted mess, that just kept getting worst. The overlapping buckle system is a pain to line up and use. I've finally decided to give up on the Cosco seat. I got tired of trying to straighten the harness straps and to fasten the complicated buckle. I just ordered another Britax Marathon."
3,Disappointed,"I received this car seat at one of my showers and was very excited about. What a let down this was. I should have listened to everyone and invested a little bit more money for a Britex. This seat was EXTREMELY hard to install in my husbands truck. If you don't have the latch system, then take this seat back. My baby is 5 months old and hates this seat. He is much more comortable in the car seat that is in my van. I was very disappointed with this seat once we started to use it."
2,installment,"I have not yet tried this car seat out in the front facing position, but rear facing it is a pain to install. It is near impossible to get it reclined as instructed. When I put this in my car I refused to drive with her in that car. When we took a trip where my baby fell asleep her head would plop down to her chest which is VERY dangerous, especially for newborns. When the police came to help install it they placed 3 pool noodles underneath it and it was still not reclined as instructed. Actually, every car seat I have had needed noodles and it is ridiculous and should be against the law. If a car seat needs to be ""rigged"" in order to be installed correctly, it should be taken off the market. On a good note, the harnesses are easy to pull tight and loosen."
4,"very practical, but difficult for rear facing in a car","The seat is fantastic, mainly because you will never need another car seat. I can't say for myself but it looks very comfortable to sit in. It is a little difficult to install for rear facing, especially in my car, which isn't small, it's a four door Nissan Altima. But you need to have it fully reclined for rear facing so it does take up some room. It's not the car seat you will want to take out and move from car to car until you can front face it, but the fact that it holds your child until 100 lbs is the BEST!! So as long as you don't mind struggling to secure it for rear facing it's well worth it. Once you can go forward it's cake! And not to mention it's very fashionable. :)"
5,Great product!,We bought this for my mom who lives in a nursing home. It sits in her windowsill and she gets lots of joy from it. It's great to have the song of birds without the mess!
1,PRD bashing,"Do not even bother to download this article. is more PRD bashing, they the ruling classes are worried by the popularity and success of the until today, Mayor of Mexico City: Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He left with an approval of 84% And he leads the polls with more of 34% over the pre-candidates Madrazo (PRI) and Creel (PAN) What inconsistencies? if PRI & PAN when they see it fit form alliances or receive in their midst the multi-betrayer Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera.Carlos M. Santillan H"
1,out of reason,"I love romance novels! I really love time travel and futuristic romance novels. This one was inane and dumb, dumb, dumb! I kept trying to read it and half way through gave up. The story line went nowhere, the characters were insipid, and the plot ridiculous. Don't bother to read it unless you are into punishment."
2,Call me a sour-faced grump.,"One reviewer said I would like this book unless I was a sour-faced grump. I never knew I was a sour-faced grump until now.I began reading the book with high expectations, because I love sci-fi romances. The plot was intriguing, and the story got off to a good start. 2 stars for that alone. But as in the one other K. Deauxville book I have read, I quickly lost interest and skimmed through to the end. The plot got too confused, and I didn't care enough by then to stay with it. Sorry, but there it is."
4,"A book not primarily for tourists; for Europeans, too.","This book appears to be primarily for Americans who have to live and work in Europe, or with Europeans; less for short-time visitors. It sheds a lot of light on the differences between American and European mentalities. It is well written, intelligent, witty and well-informed; it also nicely _illustrates_ some of the peculiarities (as seen from Europe) of American mentality. It sometimes exaggerates its points and is sometimes -- far from always -- self-congratulatory: Americans in it come out almost always as `outgoing and friendly', whereas, for European sensitivities, they are fairly often overbearing, aloof, and `uppity'. A European having to deal with Americans will profit from the book, but another one, like 'Understanding Americans' will be as helpful. As it would to an American reader."
1,Anecdotal evidence on Europe,"I found this book to be offensive, arrogant and an extremely hard read. The author uses anecdotal evidence to support his case to slight the European hand at every opportunity dwelling on the past and lamenting change. It does give an insight into how Americans are different and how their history has shaped a different perspective on life. It glorifies America's achievements both at home and abroad and glides over similar social problems that exist in America today. If you are prepared to endure the style there are some very solid observations which are creditable."
1,Not understanding Europeans!,"I could not finish this book!!!!!!!!!!! It is not really worth discussing and has just landed in the recycle bin.This writer is not objective and should stay home. Maybe write a book about ""Understanding American Natives""."
1,Arrogant and full of stigmatisms,"There was very little I could agree with in this book. It was so annoying to read that I actually finished it, but I can tell you, it did get my blood pressure up. It is another great example of how some Americans see themselves as the 'creme de la creme' of the world."
1,Terrible Kindle Formatting,"If you read this to your child, don't buy this on the Kindle. The format is horrific with blank pages, words on pages without pictures. Complete waste of money."
5,"""Hot Dog"" Rates #1 in my Classroom!","I have begun to use these Road to Reading books in my resource classroom and the students love them. They especially loved Hot Dog. Many of the words are on the state mandated word lists for K-2. The pictures are terrific and the story is interesting and funny to the kids. I thought it was great too-in fact we all fell in love with the little ""Hot Dog""."
5,Great Beginner Book,"We have a weiner dog, which of course struck a big interest in the book. My younger daughter loves it. The illustrations are cute, and the repetition of words is helpful for beginner readers. This is a great book to help young readers feel that they can read/complete a whole book by themselves. She has read it many enjoyable times."
2,Doesn't Translate to Kindle Well,"My 5 year old daughter sees me reading on my Kindle and as she is just now learning to read, she likes to read on my Kindle too. I had purchasedBig Eggfor Kindle and we both loved it so when she wanted more, I thought Hot Dog would be a good choice as it was well reviewed and sounded good. The content and pictures are great, but what doesn't work well on the e-version, is the text and formating. It is difficult for the early reader to find the text, and some pages are blank which causes delays and disinterest in the child. I do think this would be a great book in paperback just not so great in the e-version. If you are looking for something to share your Kindle with your young reader, I would suggest tryingBig Eggfirst (at the time of this review it is only $0.88 for the Kindle version)."
5,Great!,"Great book that my kid will love when he is working on his reading! The book was smaller then expected though, but that's okay."
3,"New system, same old game","I played the first Gunbird six years ago (1995) when it was released (import) on the Sony Playstation. Back then, I thought it was a great hectic-paced, old-school shooter with bright graphics and solid gameplay. If you weren't awed by the game itself, your socks were knocked off by the opening animation, which at the time was top-notch.Fast forward to 2001 and Gunbird 2. Much like Cannon Spike, Psikyo has teamed up with Capcom again to produce another fun but shallow game aimed at the old-school shooter crowd. However in the wake of games such as Treasure's magnum opus, Radiant Silvergun (Sega Saturn), Gunbird 2 feels less like nostalgia and more like complacent game design."
2,Gunbird is a RENTER ONLY PEOPLE,"Look I love my old school sprite shooters but this game gets old really really quick. I promise you will thank me about this. It IS however a good rental game. I bought it, I couldnt help myself, before playing this. I hade all of 10 minutes of fun then the games was over! It is soooo short that the only life we get outta of the game now is multiplayer and even that is old. Look if I were you I would wait for a game called GigaWing 2 which is scheduled for release this year. It is 10x better than the original and features high resolution sprites instead of the ... CS2 we get here or on GigaWing 1."
2,Boring,"I love old style 2D shooters but this one is just dull. The graphics are nice (2D) and for about 5 minutes I -almost- had fun, but then I didn't want to play it anymore. I can't quite put my finger on why this game fails but suffice it to say that it's nothing memorable. Reccommended only for people who are absolutely starving for 2D shoot-em-up action."
4,A Good Compilation!,"This singles compilation covers Manfred Mann's HMV years; with Paul Jones as their lead-singer. All British A-sides, except the first two, are included - recordings from 1965-66. Most B-sides are here too, some of which have only rarely been included ( ""John Hardy"" and ""What Am I Doing Wrong"" ) on compilations. Moreover a good handful of EP-only songs can be found.The early Manfreds were a funny mixture of pure pop, r&b; and jazz. Some of these tracks sound pretty dated today, but their best singles like ""If You Gotta Go"", ""Pretty Flamingo"" and ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"" still are great listening. Among the B-sides the Folkish ""John Hardy"" is quite enjoyable.Among the EP-tracks ""The One in the Middle"" with its great melody and self-irony stand out.A good complilation."
1,Not a strong compilation ...................,Sound quality is ordinary. I like a few tracks on cd 4 but I'm throwing the other three cds out.Samples previously available at another website have disappeared.
5,Hitting his Stride,All I have to say is that Chuck Folds is one of the greatest piano players of all time. Not only is this cd great but I have seen this man play in person and he is amazing. There are few like him.
3,Old Time Piano,I enjoy this CD a lot. Chuck plays at the Park Avenue public space next to Mason's Tennis shop on 53rd Street in NYC. He is an amazing talent! Keep in mind this CD is just for fans of old time piano (stride).
2,It cannot be compared to The Moonstone or The Woman in White,"After reading with passion both The Moonstone and The Woman in White, what a deception! The plot is thick and full of unimportant descriptions and unbelivable situations. Characters have not a life of their own: they rather enter or go out according to the needs of the writer (Brock is substituted by Midwinter in Armadale's company, Midwinter by Pedgift Junior, ans so on). The worst of the book is how previsible situations can be, and when they are not previsible at all, they are left without explanation (for example, why immediately after their marriage, Lydia losses Midwinter's affection?). I give the book two stars because of the two characters I have just mentioned: Lydia Gwilt and Ozias Midwinter. Both are intelligent, passionate and have a will of their own. They recognize each other among the dull flock of characters that surrounds them. It is a pity the plot was not as fine as its starrings."
4,Great read!,From start to finish this is great read. I've become a huge Wilkie Collins fan and am amazed I haven't found out about his writings until now.
4,Armadale,Wilkie Collins writes a wonderful story. His language and vocabulary is wonderful to read in this age of text and tweets. It reminds one of the beauty of the written word. The story is set in late 19th century England and enables the reader to go back in time. Collins writes a very perceptive description of characters and takes you into their thoughts and worlds in an extremely realistic and satisfying way.The plots twists and turns so that the reader is compelled to turn the pages whilst enjoying every word.I am hooked on Wilkie Collins.
4,College attendance requirement,"I'm very proud to keep this popular advanced algebra review book to study for a longer time. I'm totally impressed with the solutions from the CPM book giving clear steps for a talented advanced algebra student in high school who has a tougher time completing both homework/classwork and studying for tests using a textbook. Unfortunately, I realized that is a parent source of helping their pupils succeed.Unless a middle school graduate is ready for high school, he/she can start learning advanced algebra as a freshmen or later. I safely urge a new student has to review all the basic math, algebra and geometry skills before the challenges often become tough! Still, it is certainly helpful."
3,"Alternative to pricey 2-1/2"" hole base","This is a good alternative to the more expensive clear base with the 2-1/2"" hole (that item was backordered and this standard base plate is usually available for less). Just enlarge the hole so it's big enough for larger bits like the the 1/2"" roundover, and you can use all the larger 1/2"" shank edge forming bits that wouldn't fit through the standard base plate hole. There's still enough meat around the six outer holes if you enlarge the hole to about 1-5/8"" with a forstner bit or a holesaw on a drill press. It won't give you a huge hole like the 2-1/2"" model, so you can't use a big slot-cutter, but you'll save money over the specialty clear base plate."
5,it is what it is,"As a replacment part by the manufacturer, I have no problems was complete and worked exactly the way it is supposed to."
2,X marks the spot!,"This book was not much help. My instructors already told me everything that was presented in this book. I had thought that there was some `SECRET' to being a great shot or MASTER HANDGUNNER and there is ... practice, practice, practice the CORRECT things...I could have saved my money on this one and bought more ammo at the range! This could have been a pamphlet handed out at the range summarisng all the basics steps that your instructor SHOULD be telling you."
1,"My god, this book is bad","Hey, I shoot for a living. I was hoping this book would help me shoot perfect scores. Like the title states, ""Master Handgunner"". Well, I wasted my money. This book tells you nothing. Pathetic."
4,Good Beginner Manual,"I purchased this book several months before I started working with an excellent instructor. As a true ""never fired a gun before"" beginner, working with a .22 pistol, I found the very basic, simple, clear instruction provided to be very helpful. This author writes for the individual interested in shooting competitively for accuracy. The same basic techniques will apply for combat (defensive) training. As you advance, there are distinct differences. If you are a beginner interested in target shooting, buy this book. If you are interested in self-defense, then you may want to look elsewhere. Although I learn well from books, and always have, I must encourage any beginner to find a good instructor. Finding the good ones can be difficult. (See Jinnib review.) Bottom line. The book was worth the money to me."
5,Excellent Beginner's Shooting Book,"This book is well written and easy to understand. It teaches the basics of handgun marksmanship with the emphisis always on hitting the bullseye. I've been shooting for 40 years and this book taught me things I didn't know. If you want to shoot more bullseyes, you should read this book."
3,duplicate,"Not a bad book and some good added advice but alot of this is covered in the ""Pistol Marksmanship Guide"" by the US Army Marksmanship Unit. I happened to buy both books but recommend you purchase one or the other."
4,awesome,"Before paul arrive in peking,I already know that he is a awesome guitarist and good guitar teacher.{ one of my friend is his student} ALL the time i believe his guitar solo never let his fans down. AS my expected, this album still is good.You must get this album."
5,Flying Dog - Genius!,"This is Paul's second solo album and is absolutely amazing.I heard King of Clubs ( 1st Album ) and loved it but i think this surpasses the genius displayed on the first album. Pauls guitar playing never faulters once and the last track , Gilberto Concerto , is a perfect ending to a perfect album. Pauls musician ship and talents just keep on growing and he is the greatest guitar playing to ever live. He is a true virtuoso on the guitar but is capable of writing a catchy pop song with enough melodies to last all day. His singing has really grown and his vocal harmonies are amazing.For anyone looking for a great guitar album with great songs and great melodies , look no further.The future of guitar playing has never been in such safe hands."
1,Skip this one,"I just finished reading Dawn in Eclipse Bay and have to say that it's one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I really got bored with the ""I'm a Harte, you're a Madison"" throughout the book. I'd skip this one!!"
4,"Suffering from a little touch of ""Sequel-itis""?","In this sequel to the delightful ""Eclipse Bay"" we meet the feudin' Hartes and Madisons once again. This time, Lillian Harte falls victim to the charms of Gabe Madison and love and mayhem ensue. Unfortunately, this book doesn't hold up as well against the original, in my opinion. The sparkle and wit that permeated the first book is not as prevalent (maybe I just missed Winston the dog) and because much of the Harte/Madison conflict had been resolved by Rafe and Hannah in ""Eclipse Bay"", the feud as a plot device was lacking! However, these comments are not meant to dissuade any potential readers - Jayne Ann Krentz is truly a master of her genre and you won't find a better lighthearted romance around than one with her name on it!! I would urge, however, that you start with ""Eclipse Bay"" just to keep the characters in chronological order and then, after reading ""Dawn"", wait, as I am, for the next book about Nick and Octavia Brightwell!"
1,From Amanda Quick to this?,"After reading Wicked Widow by Amanda Quick,I was eager to read more from this entertaining author. Boy was I disappointed by Jayne Ann Krentz. The story is predictable and boring, and there's hardly any romance going on. Jayne Ann should make up her mind - either you write a good mystery, or a good romance, don't write a mediocre combination of the two."
3,Romeo & Juliet? Hmmm........,"Here is a section of the comment from the Review Shop:....Okay, I just read my review of the first book to remind myself of what I thought of it. I said, ""It's not that I didn't like the book....no, that's not it.....I think I needed to move on to a different time period...."" Meaning a different book! Now, reading Dawn In Eclipse Bay, I realize that it wasn't the need to move on, it was the need to end the Harte/Madison topic. I can't say I really disliked this book like a few others that come to mind, but I think the author is very repetitive in the rivalry between the two families. We get it....let's move on...... I really needed something more from the storyline. I think that if you read Dawn In Eclipse Bay, you will understand why we need more as the readers. The characters needed more depth, not ""your a Madison - I'm a Harte!"""
5,wonderful,Ordered this book as well as several others - then Hurricane Sandy hit. I still received this book in perfect condition and before the anticipated date of delivery. Thank you
3,enjoyable read,"another part of the saga of the trio of books which entertains and if not enthralls, is enjoyable to be part of"
2,Dawn in Eclipse Bay,"Much weaker compared to her first book in this trilogy. For Gabe to leave his company and take off to Eclipse Bay to chase after a woman is a bit out of this world. And Lilian, who admitted that she's a little flaky, is a real flake.The line about Gabe being 'a different type of Madison' was used so many times, it got old quickly.In her first book, one can really feel the sparks between the lead characters. Unfortunately in this one, the chemistry is pretty lame. I've read all of her books and know that Krentz can do better than this."
2,Pass this one by,"The best I can say for the 2nd in the Eclipse Bay series is ""disappointing"". I've been a fan for many, many years. This book is not at all entertaining. It is dry, boring, unexciting, unfunny, & unappealing. The story line (what there was of it) was unimaginative and the characters were one dimensional and totally without personality. As far as I can see, this book defines the ""burnout characteristic"" Ms Krentz was attempting to attribute to Gabe!!!!The first book in the series was enjoyable, this one was not. I hope the 3rd will be better, much, much better."
2,Lazy Book,"This was a lazy effort. I buy every Krentz book published, fully knowing that some are not going to be good. Not just ""not as good"", just plain not good. But the ones that are good are worth the disappointments. This is one of the disappointments. She bailed on sensual scences and she didn't fully develop the plot. I didn't care about any of these people. I didn't care ""who done it"" because what they did was silly. The first book in this series was very good, the second was lousy and, to my chagrin, I will buy the third, knowing full well it could go either way."
2,Disappointing,"This book's predecessor was a fantastic book and after reading this one I feel as if the magic of the first has been slighted. The Book of Dead Days promised much, and unfortunately did not deliver. It did not seem to have the ending or the answers that it should and at the end I was dissatisfied with the way the author took the books. I would definitely recommend the first book, but to me, the sequel did not hold the same mood that the first was able to capture."
2,ZEN....ZEN...ZEN,"If, I were working on my PHD in comparative religions and or, writting a thesis on the subject of ZEN, then perhaps, I would have given this book a higher rating. However, if the entire dogma of ZEN is; simplicity and ""nothingness"" then....Kasulis needs to re-think the concept of ""empty-mind.""I practice (or try) Zen meditative styles, but ...""this was not my cup of tea."""
4,Let us be fair,Yes the recording a bit raw but they have a great energy about them. It is great to hear various recordings that show the early evolution of the band. It is no Stangers In The Night but for MSG fans that is a treat.
1,Deactivate Reactivate,"First-off, I love these guys (Schenker, Mogg et al). The one-star rating is unfortunately for the poor sound quality. Only the 4th CD (live from Osaka) is above bootleg quality, while the other three (for these ears at least) are rather poor. Not even as good as Werewolves of London and at the rather hefty cost, not really worth it. Gary Barden is uneven in the mix and then the keyboards are way too high on the 3rd CD (being the Built to Destroy Tour). On the plus side, some nice photos of the boys, being Paul Raymond, Cozy Powell (RIP) et al and some decent liner notes from Paul Raymond, although more details from Paulie would have been nice."
2,Disappointment/Unbalanced,"I wanted to like this album. I really did. I'm a big Van Halen fan, and a big Van Hagar fan as well.It's just too trite. Many of the songs feel like they threw a bunch of good elements in a hat (low chorused guitar riff/harmonics/big beat/primal scream/crazy solo/resolving of tension with soaring melodic guitar) and pulled them out in combinations to create songs. Some of these elements work for a few bars, but ultimately they all disappoint.Honestly, there isn't a single song on this album that is really complete and interesting. Sorry guys. I tried."
2,"eh,not so good",They try to keep the rockin' feel of F**K but it sounds too over produced and Sammy's vocals are straining at this point.Harder than 5150 and ou812 but not as good as f**k or any with Roth.
2,fair at best,Balance is another letdown from Van Halen. Can't Stop Loving You and Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do are highlights. The remainder of the disc is boring.
5,One of the Best Van Hagar CDs!!,"This is my one of my favorite VH CDs with a new Producer and different audio engineering techniques really bring the band into a musical zone. Also Eddie had a new hair do. Too bad it was the last with Sammy. I really loved that guy (wipes tear from eye). Okay, I'm alright, Well if you don't own this one I highly recommend it. Eddie rocks on Aftershock, Baluchitherium, Feelings, Big ""Phat"" Money well all of them rock. I love Not Enough too, one of the greatest ballads by the band. Well I think you get the point. I give it two thumbs up along with the middle finger to anyone who passed by this one. That is all."
2,It's okay,"Ah yes. The album and era where Eddie thought he'd better grow a goatee. That aside I have mixed feelings about this album and to be honest I rarely play it. I do like 'Feelin' and 'Take me back' and 'Seventh Seal' has a bit of epic about it but I think the band had gone a little stale at this stage.Still a lot better than most of the new crap out there, but for me the worst (least best) album of the Hagar era. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could."
3,Van Hagar IV,"Everyone seems to have a different Hagar-era favorite. My belief is that each album with him was a tad worse than the one before it. Not meaning that ""Balance"" is bad, but ""5150"" is easily my fave, then ""OU812"", etc. There are numerous songs here I like, but the majority sounds like good filler to me. Even the hit ""Can't Stop Lovin' You"" is just an average track to my ears. BUT, the album isn't bad either. ""Seventh Seal"" and ""Don't Tell Me (what love can do)"" are good, and ""Amsterdam"" is fairly rockin'. ""Not Enough"" is also one of their better and moving ballads. Overall I'd call this a must for the Van Hagar fanatic, but casual fans looking for another ""Dreams"" or ""Finish What Ya Started"" won't find it here."
3,Loosing momentum,"Maybe the reason was an already developing internal conflict between Hagar and the band, I don't know, but the result in this album was less than satisfactory... The songs are a little bit overlong, a little bit boring and screaming."
2,VAN HALEN IS SUCH A POOR BAND,"The drummer plays like a fool, sammy hagar is too romantic, and the songs are boring, very boring.......zzzzzzz"
2,Two good songs a lot of fillers!,"This album has only two great songs: ""Seventh seal"" and ""Can't stop lovin' you"", the rest is at best mediocre. I'm not a big fan of Sammy Hagar and his squealing and strained singing style, and I can never come to terms with a Van Halen without David Lee Roth. But believe me, that has nothing to do with my low rating. Most of the songs are just not captivating and they are forgettable. If you prefer Sammy Hagar over David Lee Roth, like I know a lot of people do, you better buy ""5150"" instead of ""Balance"" since it's the best Hagar/VH album."
2,Bland,"The main issue with Balance is tone. The production is terrible, and the chemistry of Hagar VH is not present. There are two great songs, and the rest are trash. Van Halen III is far better than this trash. Fair Warning: Buy Van Halen III, and avoid this garbage!"
2,balance,"very disappointed, balance lacks the originality that is vh, can't stop loving you sounds like it was thrown together in 15 minutes, as far as tracks like aftershock and feeling, they sound like teeny bopper surface rock, although vh is my favotite band of all time, they made the right decision in replacing sammy, his lyrics on this one are sooooo childish they might as well be poison. still love ya vh!"
2,Van Hagar,"1995 outing by Van Halen with Sammy Hagar on vocals. A heavier sound than most of their other album's material. I thought it was generic. Key tracks are: The Seventh Seal, Can't Stop Loving You, Don't Tell Me and Aftershock. Overall, the worst Van Halen album I've heard to this point, but has enough worthwhile material for diehards and metal heads. I wouldn't recommend it other than to fill your (metal) collection."
1,Sammy Hagar is a HORRIBLE lyricist!,"At age 13 I MIGHT have written a chorus line that said, ""I can't stop lovin' you No matter what I say or do"" However, the next day I would have reread it, scratched it out and possibly burned the remains as to not embarrass myself. It's sad where Sammy took this once outstanding and timeless group of icons. Now Cherone (who wrote WARHEADS w/Extreme ""...I'm a warhead, he's a warhead, she's a warhead, etc"") is taking over. Suggestion to Eddie, ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE choose a lyricist first and a strong singer second next time around, okay? Sort of like you did the first time!"" Name a song which will live on forever in the Sammy Hagar era. It's like trying to rhyme a word with orange. Try to find a song which wasn't timeless with Roth. Rock, Lock, Stock, Clock, Hock, Mock..."
2,"Oh, boy....","Compared with ""VAN HALEN III"", of course BALANCE is a masterpiece !!! But the album shows clear signs of tiredness by the part of the band, with Anthony and Alex delivering the most predictable rhythm section as always, and Eddie annoying the listener with messy guitar solos, mixtured with uninspired guitar licks and riffs. Above all this, comes the limited and weary voice of SAmmy Hagar. Not the mention the usual silly lyrics.. All in all, a great waste of time, but VH fans will always swallow anything these heartless and commercial rockers ever put out."
1,The Worst VH release with Sammy Hagar on Vocals!,"Hagar never really fit Van Halen the way David Lee Roth did. Roth was there from the start and his presence was known greatly and he, like Vince Neil with Motley Crue, made the band work with the other members. Hagar took over in 1986 and he gave the band a more radio approach. The songs were more poppy, Eddie played piano and keyboards more and the lyrics became more serious than Dave's ""party-hearty"" anthems. However, when Roth left VH, he left them with a DYNAMITE CD, ""1984"". With this, Hagar's last release with VH, he leaves with the worst album the band has ever released (besides the VHIII album that awaited). The songs are flat and only ""The Seventh Seal"" gets kickin' like Van Halen. The rest are Hootie and The Blowfish-esque crap. This isn't Van Halen, this is a middle-aged band that resembles the once powerful VH!"
1,VH's WORST ALBUM,Don't waste your money on this. This is the worst VH album of all time. Even Van Halen 3 is better than this. Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?) and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now. The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
3,Balance,"In what turns out to be the final full album of the Sammy Hagar era, Balance, as an album, is OK but nothing special. 'Can't Stop Lovin' You' and 'Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)' are solid enough and 'Not Enough' is probably their most intriguing ballad, but tensions were already flaring up between Hagar and Eddie Van Halen and it shows throughout this album. In my opinion, Eddie's guitar presence is hardly overwhelming. The music seems disjointed and slap-dash. If you're driving around or doing chores around the house, it's an album that can provide decent background noise. That said, it's arguably the weakest of the Hagar era."
5,4 or 5 stars?,"Well, I don't know. It's a tough call. But since I'm listening to this CD right now (and loving it!), I'll be generous and give a 5. Every song on here is strong, even the supposed ""filler"" instrumentals like ""Doin' Time"" and ""Baluchitherium"", which REALLY rocks with Eddie's smooth-as-silk guitar gliding over the crunchy riffs in the background. There are the typical great VH singalong tunes like ""Can't Stop loving You"" and ""Amsterdam"", a cheesy (but still good) ballad in ""Not Enough"", but also some real thoughful, darker songs like ""Don't Tell Me"" and ""Feelin'"". And the 'epic' song ""The Seventh Seal"" recalls the ""Poundcake"" riff, but by no means rips it off in any way. It's an original, and great, tune! If Van Halen 3 is really THAT bad (I haven't heard it yet), I don't see why they slipped so much. After all, Sammy sucks (according to the DLR fans), so him leaving wouldn't have made a difference. ;) (yeah, RIGHT.)"
4,A good yet confused Van Halen...,on this album. I think the frustration and fighting was starting to take its toll and it shows. The album is good but doesn't really take an identity.
3,It's pretty good.,"It might even be the second best Hagar era album, behind ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge."" We get two Hagar style ballads with the word ""love"" in the title. Oh joy. Oh rapture. Actually, they're not that bad. But they are a little sappy. And then when you have a song about hookers on the album (Amsterdam) the lovey-dovey pop-rockers come across as rather fake.Eddie sounds pretty good again, meaning his guitar isn't quite so thick with the dreaded Eventide Harmonizer. But it's still not dry and raw.""Balance"" is pretty good, but far from classic. For fans only."
4,The Slippery Slope--Here's Sammy & Eddie sliding down,"First, BALANCE isn't an awful album. It's not VH's best, that's obvious, but it's not a throwaway like their next album would be (sans Sammy), VAN HALEN III. ""Can't Stop Lovin' You"" is blantant pop, but so what? Isn't that the essence of the band--fun music? ""Take me Back"" is pretty good, and so is ""Aftershock"". But the rest of the tunes are uncharacteristically bleak or slapshod. But any album with three good songs equals a good album."
1,"No, I do think this is the worst Van Hagar album to date",What was Van halen thinking when they put this one together? The songs are just this....GARBAGE! They try and rock out but make a very uneven and [...] recording. The CD just doesnt flow and w/Sammy Van Hagar on vocals it just makes things worse. 2 thumbs way down!! Come back Dave we miss you.
1,Warning: No widescreen version,"I bought this new expecting this to have a widescreen version because on the back of the cardboard sleeve it reads ""presented in both widescreen and full screen formats"". i take the sleeve off and the back of the actual DVD case just reads"" full screen format"". very sneaky and not cool."
2,Terrible DVD release,"While this is a fine movie, that should have gorgeous visuals...this friggin' DVD is FULL SCREEN. There is no widescreen version.Do not purchase this unless you will watch it on an antique TV....otherwise its a terrible home-viewing experience."
5,HISTORY IN YOUR FACE,"We don't need to know someone is, or was royalty to know they have, or has blood of kings in their nature. It was horable the way life has been taken for granted in them days. But, it's also good to know that the conflict haven't effect the busy to complete the project. Excellent movie for everyone to learn a lesson from. GERONIMO should be more than a name that's yelled across the sky before someone jump from a plane. He is trully a legion."
4,Great Movie,"This is probably one of the best, and most underrated, westerns of modern times. Robert Duvall gives stunning performance as Al Sieber. Wes Studi, Gene Hackman, and Matt Damon are also great in this movie. Visually, Walter Hill, portrays the west better than any other director. Yet, this movie is full of historical innaccuries, espically pertaining to Jason Patric and Al Sieber's characters. However, it is a magnificent production, it is a shame is failed at the box office."
4,American History,"This is an interesting movie and once again one that doesn't paint a very glowing report of the American governments handling of Indian affairs. The events depicted show a sad history lesson of a proud nations demise, and the hopeless course of events that led to their eventual downfall. The film is well acted by all the leading stars and the reality and authenticity of the movie are professionally portrayed. This is a movie that all should see and appreciate the struggle that unfortunate people have for equal rights. Geronimo is a legend and his name will never be forgotten."
1,Regular Hollywood Cowboy shootin' up,"As I stated, this is one of those Hollywood's regular Cowboy shoot'em-up... If you look for a good Native American movie about their culture, this isn't it! I know it states this is a true story, but of course Hollywood embellishes on it [so I doubt some of the information given.] Columbia Motion picture's did a great job on a pictorial perspective, but nothing more."
2,"False Advertising, Pure and Simple",In a nutshell- Sony advertises this DVD on the back covers of its various releases as a widescreen film; but the disc is in fullscreen. I've contacted them and am returning my copy to them and they will send me a WS replacement only when they actually check the disc beforehand. If all of you who ended up with the Fullscreen version would do the same maybe Sony will get the message! I don't have their number here but it is for Sony Home Entertainment. I must add that the gal I spoke to was probably the nicest Customer Rep for a company I've dealt with in a long time!
5,Excellent true sory concerning the Apache Chief Geronimo,"Walter Hill's film is full of action and drama concerning the Apache Chief Geronimo. Wes Studi should have got an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of the Apache Chief. Also outstanding performances by Robert Duvall as Al Siebur the Indian Scout, Jason Patric as Lt. Charles Gatewood, Gene Hackman as Gen. Crook, and Steve Reevis as Apache Scout Chato. Jason Patric's horsemanship is showcased in a scene where an Apache warrior is charging at him on horseback, firing a pistol. A standout scene. A must see for Western Fans. This is an eye opening look at how the Apache were treated by the U.S. government. A truly sad part of American history."
2,Not as expected,This is very small & more the size of a charm than a pendant. Not what I was looking for.... I sent it back.
4,Situating Influencial Utopias/Proto Speculative Fictions,"This collection is excellent. By bringing together a richer context for these works, a clearer view of early modern social dreaming comes into view; this is useful since that period shapes our world so much."
3,Disappointed!,"We got this for our daughter's birthday, just opened it! The main part which is the tower does NOT spin after you wind it up! It only moves for about 1 second before stopping! Does anyone else have this problem.I got this at Walmart for 34 dollars. But it is the 2 pet one!"
3,Good but not great,"My daughter whos four, just discovered littlest pets. She does like to play with this toy. However, ours does not spin also, the door falls off. And there are a lot of little pieces that I am hoping will get lost or sucked up by the vacume. It is also a pain to take out of the box. Do not pay amazons price. Walmart sells this for $35.00"
2,Not a book,"This is an analysis it is not the book, please disregard the comments from other customers, obviously they never read the book that it's been selling."
2,Can't Beat The Original,"The screenplay for this version is flawed. By introducing characters and scenes not in the book, it changes the spirit and tone. The actor playing the young boy is good, Patty Duke is not vulnerable enough to efface Geraldine Page's fragile and unforgettable performance. My advice is to wait for a restored version of the original. The only one available now is a faded black and white (color faded) version with an audio flaw. It's a crime that someone hasn't restored this masterpiece to bring it back to its original glory."
3,Not totally Christmas Movie,"It's not a typical Christmas movie. I really enjoyed it, but it has such a sad ending, the ending spoiled the movie in my opinion..."
3,A Christmas Memory,"Was disappointed in the story-line of the DVD. Enjoyed what was there of the story was just dissatisfied with the way the movie ended. It kind of left you hanging without giving you that ""feel good feeling"" desired when watching a Christmas movie."
5,Love it!,"This is a perfect movie. Love it for anytime of year, not just Christmas. Great for the family. Shipped quickly with no problems. Thanks"
2,A Christmas Memory,"It could have been a good story but the characters were not very credible and the plot was rather feeble. It seemed to be tedious, and had a very weak conclusion"
2,Hollywood arrogance,"Once again Hollywood has decided that a genius author is not good enough for their film efforts. Although the color is welcome, the acting superb, and the little Truman adorable, the screenwriters have added several unwarrented scenes and twists to the original plot. I guess if they feel they are better than Shakespeare, who is Truman Capote to be spared? The original is much superior even if it is in black and white."
2,Could be better,"I liked this movie but, it was kind of slow going in the story line and I really hated the ending. It left you feeling like you needed to more of what happened to the boy. The movie wasn't terrible but, just wasn't the best either."
1,Something is greatly missing!,"Based on one of the all-time classic pieces of modern christmas literature, this TV movie version of the heartwarming Truman Capote tale of a young boy and his child-like older relative is devoid of any heart or warmth that was associated with the original story. Overacted, overwritten and overdone, it seems such a shame that hollywood could not have let this simple timeless tale be a sweet 30 minute special rather then dragging it out to 90 minutes of convoluted rubbish. Back in 1966 ABC did just that with a 30 minute version of ""A Christmas Memory"" starring Geraldine Page in a touching and poignant performance. As for me, I was able to locate a hard to find a copy of the 1966 version and with it's help have been able to erase this forgettable version of ""A Christmas Memory"" from my memory."
2,Get the Geraldine Page version!,Well - I had high hopes for this version. It seriously disappointed me. The kid (Buddy) is treacly and too 'modern' and there is too much 'extra' written into the film that is totally unecessary. Duke seems to young to play Sook. It was written witrh a modern audience inmind - an audience that is used to having everything spoon fed to them.The Geraldine Page version is FAR SUPERIOR - and almost EXACTLY to the actual text of the wonderful book without a lot of extra stuff that is not needed. The mood is striking - the music sublime.
5,"Wonderful ""Christmas Memory""","I saw this film several years ago when it originally aired on television, and I loved it. I was so excited to get it on DVD. What a wonderful, heartwarming tale.I will say that I never saw the original with Geraldine Page. That being said, I believe Patty Duke's performance was unbelievable. She was amazing in a very understated way. She makes the audience fall in love with Sook after only a few minutes. The relationship between her and Buddy (played nicely by Eric Lloyd) is evident from the beginning.Piper Laurie also turns in a very fine performance, but it is really Patty Duke who shines in this wonderful film."
3,A NEW EDITION OF CAPOTE'S CLASSIC TALE,"Patty Duke tried awfully hard to bring Capote's classic character Cousin Suk to life in this newer screen adaptation of his famous short story. As wonderful as Duke is, she cannot erase the memory of Geraldine Page's performance in the 1966 ABC Television production with Mr. Capote narrating. This newer version is about a half-hour longer and introduces a number of additional characters and expands on the story. About the only thing that is missing is the charm and simplicity of Capote's original."
1,NOT UP TO THE FIRST,"Lacks charm of the one staring G. Page. Destroys the ""universe of two"" feel of the relationship between the boy and the old woman. Brings in too many charecters to explain things easily covered by the Truman Capote narraration in the first one!"
4,Well what can I say,This was a good movie. The young boy did a real good job. So did the other people. But I did not consider a one of my favorite Christmas movie to watch. It needed more topics about Christ and his saving grace.
5,A Christmas Memory,This is a lovely story. The only thing lacking is Truman Capote's narrative.I am hoping my grand children will enjoy the film as much as I have in the past.
4,A Christmas Memory,Received in a timely manner and in good condition. This is one of my favorite Christmas stories. I look forward to viewing the DVD next Christmas.
2,What a disappointment!,"I was so looking forward to watching this movie, especially after reading the great reviews. I NEVER would have ordered this if I had seen it first. To start off what boy is going to hang out with an old lady ALL day. Also it seemed as if Patty Duke was the hired cook, until she mentioned that they all owned the house. At one point Duke's character gave whiskey to this young boy and they both got drunk. I had high expectation given the cast and reviews. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the rest of this boring movie, that didn't seem real or keep my interest. If I could send it back and get a refund that's what I'd do. I do NOT recommend this movie."
5,Very much alive,"You don't have to be Italian to love this gem of a book. Like a great meal served properly, I finished longing for more, hoping it was merely an appetizer for something longer from Mr. Fragola. Don't let the title fool you - this is not in the horror genre. More like James Joyce and Woody Allen, in a bite-size format (and the wonderful descriptions of food will have you salivating). The perfect book to carry with you for when you get stuck waiting somewhere, or to put by the bed to read when you first wake up or are about to drift off to sleep. The short stories stand alone but are all told from the same boy's POV and add up to a charming, poignant whole. I've been re-reading them to my elderly mother. They always trigger a cherished memory from her childhood I had never heard before. That is priceless. Children will love the stories, too."
4,"Some are treasures, but not all","I read a lot of Asimov non-fiction (essays, textbooks, etc.), so I figured this might be something similar. It's really not; Feynman is not a very good writer, and in any case much of this book is transcription from talks he has given. The talks are fascinating, but not particularly well-organized. On the other hand, the ""appendix"" piece (from the report on the Challenger disaster) is absolutely incredible. The content is straightforward, factual, and devastating. That piece alone is worth the price of the book."
4,Excellent!,An entertaining firsthand account of a genius physicist in accessible language largely curated from a series of lectures you can probably 'hear' in your head if you've watched youtube clips of his lectures. A free spirit - an odd descriptor for a Nobel prize winning physicist.
5,The Pleasure of Feynman,"This book is a great introduction to Feynman, though I would still have to recommend ""Surely You're Joking..."" for the novice. That book was not technical at all, and exposed Feynman's joy in both learning and being a prankster. The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is (slightly) more technical in places, but hardly difficult. It is also much more well-rounded, allowing greater insight into Feynman, who was:1. Smart as hell2. Arrogant3. Happy only when learning4. Quite a storyteller (in every sense of the word)5. Thoroughly unconventionalThe piece by Freeman Dyson was worth the price of admission, and led me to investigate his works (also highly recommended). I also think the very underrated Challenger Inquiry report was extremely interesting.Keep in mind, though, that many people I've spoken with really dislike Feynman's arrogance (one person said ""he's just a jerk""). I personally feel he had every right to be vain, but over the course of four books, it does get tiring."
3,Not the best of Feynman,"While I greatly enjoyed 'Surely You're Joking Dr. Feyman..."" this book leaves me unentertained. There are a number of insightful articles and some gems, but the best material is repeated from 'Surely you're joking...'. For the dedicated Feynman fan, this is must-have, but it's a poor intro: read another of this amazing man's works first!"
2,"Good writer, but the worst publisher","I bought the book so that I can enjoy reading the brilliant thinking of Mr. Feynman. But it's painful to read this book from this publisher - Basic Books of the Perseus Books Group. The book paper is not of good quality. I can live with that. But font is so bad. In the middle of some paragraphs, a line is changed to smaller font. It happens all through the book. It just make my eye sore. I will avoid this publisher as possible as I can in the future."
3,"Somewhat uneven, but still worthwhile","While some parts of this book are very enjoyable and provide a wonderful window into both Feynman's way of thinking, and the historical context (the ""Los Alamos from Below"" section, for example), I found others more difficult. Still worth reading, absolutely, just don't expect the same level of interest, humor, scientific detail, or just about any other aspect to be consistent from one section to another. This makes sense, as the book is a collection of items given to - and intended for - different audiences at different times. Unfortunately, at least for me, the inconsistencies meant that I could barely put the book down while reading some sections but found myself preferring other reading material over Mr Feynman's musings while working my way through the others."
4,Great book if you haven't read much Feynman,"All but one of the 'shorts' in this book have previously been published - if you have extensively read Feynman (or even moderately) you'll learn/read nothing new about him.If you are a new Feynman discoverer however it is a superb book and may well lead you on to wanting to get hold of his other works.For me though, I was looking for new stuff and was a little disappointed although I did read the whole book and am pleased to have it in my collection."
1,Disappointing,Disappointing to say the least. The book at times is too technical and drags on and thus dosent engross as much as other feynmann books like surely you must..... Probably this is meant for a different audience. The challanger report is interesting though. Buy it only if you want to spend some evenings concentrating on what you are reading...
1,Boring,"I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs."
4,Feynman a long time hero!,Getting to know Dr. Feynman is greatly fascilitated by this book. It's recommended to science oriented readers.
2,MAX BALL 65 CM,Just not sure how to inflate this ball. There were NO instructions or diagrams?????2 noses - 2 plugs - nothing on how other than what end to attach the pump and the hose.??????
5,Not what I wanted - but great service!,"Although I made an error and ordered the wrong item, it arrived promptly and in brand new conditon (as promised). When I returned it to the seller for a full refund, it was honored, again promptly. I will definitely purchase from this seller again - very customer oriented!"
3,Family time..,"I bought this for my grandson to play. This ball is a medium size. I have a full size and he loves playing with the ball, however this one is some kind of small."
2,developed a hole after a few months of normal use,"I noticed it was deflating a little every day and after examining I noticed a tiny hole. I've been doing typical exercises with it for about 2 months. Is that all the life I get out of the product?I have no issues with the company, I love the pearly color, and for a while the ball was great. Pump was very cheap, but it lasted me longer than the ball."
4,I am using it right now,"Overall I like this product. There are some problems: The pump is amazingly cheap-o and I needed a plus one to blow it up initially (someone to hold the pump nozzle up against the opening in the ball since the nozzle does not fit into the opening, it just rests on top and someone to pump the pump). Another minor annoyance is having to re-fill the ball. The plug is hard to remove, it has broken my nails and caused much consternation and minor pain. That said. I would still buy this product because it looks good, I've only had to refill it twice (at the beginning), now it seems to have settled into it's self. I use this as an alternative to my office chair, maybe I will use it as an exercise ball, but for now it just helps me be more comfortable and active while sitting at my desk."
4,No complaints,"Works as it should. The pump that comes with it is a little chintzy, but it gets the job done."
5,just like the ones you use at the gym..,"I first started using excercising balls at the gym, and loved it. I went and bought one.. and for some reason, it just wasn't the same. A girlfriend of mine also got me one, and again.. just not what I was used to.. then I ordered this one, and it was exactly like the one I used at the gym.. and cheaper than the other ones I had. SO, I highly recommend this. Read the directions and do do another round of air the next day.. its perfect."
4,"Fair price, good buy","The ball needs one day to soften up before it can be completely inflated. After that, needs refills only about once a week, and I sit on it for several hours every day. Good choice at a decent price."
3,Pump Flimsy,"I just got this ball and, when inflated it looks good, although maybe not perfectly round at first. The pump which came with it worked, but was kind of insubstantial as far as pumps go. The hose to the pump kept falling off and I had to put it back on several times. However, the ball did inflate within 5 or 10 minutes."
2,not happy,"This ball was small, it had a bad and horrible pump (hard to use), low quality, ugly logo. We had to return it as it did not serve our purpose as a birthing ball"
5,Solid Swiss Ball,"Very good quality, only con is that the rubber is a bit sticky. It will grab animal hair from the carpet and paint off the wall."
4,"Good ball, pump could be better","The ball itself is worth the money. The included pump is not. The pump requires a lot of work to fill a 65mm diameter ball. Also, it would be heplful to include some sort of instructions on how firm the ball should be when filled."
2,Good color for home decor (but latest one smells a lot),"If you want to leave your exercise ball out anywhere in your home this is a good color choice! The pearly white looks decorative.P.S. I'm noticing that someone else has mentioned a strong chemical smell coming from the ball. I, too, am sensitive to these smells. The first ball I ordered arrived in early January (and was given away as a gift) and did not have any problematic odors. A second ball which came more recently is very smelly. We're putting it outside to air out and hope it will get better. The odor is quite strong -- can't be too ""green"" an item."
2,Too soft,"I had to return this ball, when inflated to 65cm, it was still a gummy, soft plush ball that my body sunk 1/4 way into. Even when I added more air, it was still too soft. It felt as if it would only go firm if pumped to a diameter near explosion. The texture is shiny and sticky, which may be fine for exercise, but not comfortable for sitting."
2,Too Squishy,"I bought this item for myself to work out. I expected it to be amazing for the price, but when I opened it and pumped it up I learned otherwise.The ball is the size it's advertised as, BUT is way too squishy to work out on. I was expecting a firm work out ball but this one is near impossible to use unless you want it for seating. I wouldn't buy this again. My Walmart work out ball was 1/2 the price and better than this product. The packaging was nice but the product is awful."
3,broke in 6 months,"I used the ball only to sit at my home desk. I am a small 125 lb woman... The ball was not under a lot of stress. It was fine, loved it, and then the ball spontaneously just popped a small split on the side while I was sitting on it. I got off, set it aside, intending to find a patch for it later. As it slowly deflated, a foot-long split appeared! What? These things aren't made to last."
3,Just ok,"I bought this ball because I was 37 weeks pregnant and needed something to help ease my lower back pain and also to help with labor exercises. The box the ball came in had no instructions. I was able to figure it out but it would've been easier with instructions. The ball itself is very.. Flimsy(?) it seems to lose air even after checking it several times for holes and what not. Being VERY prego at the time, it was almost impossible to get up because it gets very low. All in all, the ball is just ok."
2,"Incomplete, not as advertised!","Ok, I didn't expect to have details instructions on how to inflate the thing, but SOME instruction and a freaking stopper would have been nice! I believe the product I received was used and returned and resold to me. Buyer beware!"
4,Good Swiss Ball,"This is a nice quality Swiss/Exercise Ball. It comes with a foot pump which worked well, and also includes two ""stoppers"" in case you lose one. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others."
4,Nice ball,"The ball is really great. Good for core exercises, I just got it a few days ago and man I feel the work."
4,wish it was a little taller,"My husband and I are both tall (he's 6'2"" and I'm 5'10"") so I wish we'd picked a slightly larger ball. Otherwise, this one is great."
3,Big round black stain on the ball. Otherwise good.,I was happy with how the exercise ball looked and felt until I inflated it. That's when a big black stain showed up. Unfortunately the stain wouldn't wash off.
4,max fitness exercise ball and foot pump,"Nice exercise ball, but a little too big for me, I'm 5'2"". I use it for resistance training with ball workouts. Good quality. The foot pump was a little pesky though. The hose kept slipping off the ball's air intake valve. Had to use my hands cpr style to get the ball fully expanded. My husband and I had to take turns pumping air into the ball. Anyway, I could put up with this. I would recommend the ball to others, but for someone taller than myself. Good product for your exercise needs. :-)"
2,Good Customer Service,The first ball that we received leaked. After writing the company about the problems we've had with the ball they are sending us a new one.
4,i liked it,I like the balance ball though i don't use it as often as i thought i would. it takes patients to inflate using the manuel pump and my ball seems to loose firmness often. possibly due to tempurature changes.
1,Sent the wrong size,"I ordered this 65 cm ball and when it arrived, the box said 65 cm but the ball measures 55 cm. This seems to be a common problem with exercise balls in general, and I suppose one advantage is that this ball is direct from Amazon, so returning it and getting a replacement is relatively easy. Still, I looked into this issue before deciding on this ball, and this ball seemed to be pretty good in this regard, so I'm frustrated."
2,Could be better....,"The ball seems durable-- however the pump doesn't work well inflating the ball enough to be sturdy enough for exercising. We have tried many times to get the ball inflated more, it just doesn't hold the air and the pump is not very efficient."
2,ball deformed,"The ball is workable, but is quite deformed, kind of like Jupiter bulging out at the equator, but not equally in all directions ..."
5,Great exercise ball,"I love this ball. The pump is a bit flimsy, but it did the job. I only had to add a little air in it once after about 6 weeks use. I am 5'7"" and the ball fits me perfect. It is very easy once you get used to it and just flows along nicely with your body. I love the pearl white color.I would recommend this product."
4,I like this product very much...,I actually bought this ball to use in place of my computer chair! lol I figured it would be a good way to incorperate exercise in to a every day thing. I also bought the dvd with it so I can do the workout. :)
2,"Came discolored, without a plug and without instructions",The product came incomplete and the customer support consists of a voicemail. I left a message and wasn't called back.
1,poor customer service,"The ball is made of a great material, but I called Max Fitness to find out how far to insert the plug, plus how to get it out without damaging the ball. I left a message explaining the situation and they never returned either call I made to them. It's a good product, but I wish they would stand behind it by making a return phone call, or sending me some inflation information as I had requested. Lack of follow-up by a company is frustrating to me."
1,"Waste of time: says 65 cm, actually measures 56 cm","I ordered this ball from Amazon and it's not actually 65cm in diameter. Its actually 56cm (based on the measurements of circumference). I plan to use this to sit on at my home desk, but its way too small. this has been a total waste of my time and money. i'm angry that i even need to ship this garbage back to Amazon for a refund. they should be paying ME for this!"
4,"Good ball, Pump and Package are Junk","The important part of this item (the ball) seems to be good quality. Rubber seems to be average or better thickness, and I expect it will hold up better than a couple flimsy ones I've seen/tried in the past. The pump is mostly a joke. Pump/tube/connections kept falling apart, probably faster to blow up manually, (but that would put some water in the ball then.) Luckily, after abandoning the joke of a pump I was able to inflate it in seconds with spray nozzle on my air compressor, nice!No instructions included, so no indication of how much air to put in or any other use guidelines. Fill nozzle just comes with a plastic plug that goes in hard and comes out much harder (almost felt like I might damage the ball when I opened it to add more air.) In short, the total package is junk. Still as it was near the lowest price out their, it gets 4 out of 5 as a solid value and because the actual ball seems to be fine quality."
3,"Ball is fine, but pump is total crap","The fitness ball itself is fine - although it gradually loses air over time.The main problem is the pump. The pump is complete crap. While pumping the hose will detach from the pump, you'll lose a bunch of air, you'll reattach the hose, and then the valve will pop off the other side causing you to lose even more air. Basically, it will take 5 times longer to pump up the ball than it should.It's a good ball, but the pump will test your patience (and your ability to find small objects (the valve) that have shot off the pump half-way through use)."
1,Not the size advertised,"I was looking for an exercise ball to use as a desk chair, I tried a 65cm one and it was the appropriate height. When I received this ball and inflated it I noticed it was larger than I was expecting - when I measure it, it's actually 75cm. It doesn't work so well to sit on because it's so large."
3,Exercise Ball,This ball is huge and feels soooo good when you lay back to get a good stretch. I bought this (the largest one) to help ease back pain and recovery from a c-section. It's doing wonders in helping to get that stretch I need and makes sit ups a little easier too. Also an added bonus is that it's become a great thing for baby and me... when he's fussy we just bounce!
3,Good buy for the price,I gought this ball to use a chair at my desk and it seems to work okay for this purpose
2,For older kids,"My son requested this book for a book report that he's doing on a famous American. Although the book is listed for ages 9-12, it's really more appropriate for 12 and above. My son found it difficult to stay interested in this book as it's not written in a format that keeps a 9-year-old intrigued. My son is an excellent reader, so being unable to read wasn't the problem. The book gives almost too much detail about incidents and experiences in Henry Ford's life. Short and sweet might have worked better if this book is being marketed for the 9-12 age group."
3,Tha Early Tupac Shakur,I think this recording is notone of the best albums Tupac has released. The quality of some songsis very bad. In the CD cover they wrote some s**t that Tupac was 26 and he was shot on September 5th.
1,Its not the 2Pac we all know and love,"in my mad frenzy to get any album that even has a chance of having 2pac in it.. i snatched this up as soon as i saw it. Unfortunatly, all it took was one listen to realize that it sounds nuthing like 2pac at all.. very hard to distinguish wich singer is our hero thug. Only 1 song is recognizable as Pac. a very disappopinting album for the most diehard fan. even worse, even it it did sound like him, the music is very cheesy and low budget.. this must be very very early tupac."
3,RUN if You Dare,"RUN if You Dare by Randy Powell is a really great book if you like realistic fiction. I think this was a great realistic fiction and encourage you to read it, but I don't like realistic fiction so that is why I gave it three stars. This book is about a young fifteen year old boy named Gardner, whose family has been having problems lately. His dad his been out of work so his mom is coming back late and stressed out. His sister thinks Gardner is going to end up like his father trying different jobs and getting fired. Gardner is mad at his father because he keeps playing golf in isn't doing anything in his life. He learned a lot from his father of what not do. Gardner doesn't want to tell his father what he is doing wrong but he just wishes he would help out instead of playing golf. He wishes his friends can add some spunk in his life especially a really good friend named Annie. Then abruptly something happened that changed his life."
1,disappointment,As i read the preview for this book i was excited by it and i thought it would be a good book. After I was done reading it i realized there was no plot to it and no plot. I also thought Randy Powell needed to make realistic characters.
5,Insightful Sports fan,"Borelli's book is to be recommended for the sports fans who want to read more than the ordinary book about a well-known sports personality. He writes well and tells a compelling story of Mel Allen's life from an insider's viewpoint. One would have wished to have had Borelli's book years before, to really appreciate the personality behind the Voice.He does particularly well when relating the details of Mel's firing by the NY Yankees in 1964. One need go no further than this book to understand what happened to the Voice of the Yankees during this difficult period in Allen's life a well as the lives of his fans who no longer had his golden voice to impart the real feel for the games.In short, a great book by a really good writer. Let's hope Mr. Borelli writes more books of this kind!"
1,More like BOR-ing-ELLI!,"I was talked into this humdrum boredom while at a book signing in New York. I was hoping, that while the author may have been dull in person, personality would've shone through in his writing. Not at all, people. I recommend the book only if sleeping pills aren't working for you anymore."
4,For Baseball lovers,great read for anyone who loves baseball. Filled with stories that will bring back lots of memories.
4,"Fun, corny crooning from the 1930s and '40s","Crooner Buddy Clark sang with a number of orchestras - here he croons for Eddy Duchin, Xavier Cugat, Ray Noble and others. Initially he imitated Bing Crosby, although all too soon he shifted to copying Frank Sinatra's sound, which he did quite well. If you enjoy Sinatra's earliest work, when he was with the Dorsey band, and when he was on Capitol, then you might really like this collection of rare recordings from a fine, forgotten WWII-era vocalist. This disc spans from 1938 to 1949, when Clark perished in a plane accident. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)"
4,Quality Stuffed Elephant,I bought this for my girlfriend who wanted something soft and cuddlie for Christmas. That's just what she got! This is a high quality stuffed Elephant has quality stitched seams that are hard to see (that is a good thing). You get what you pay for with this product.
5,My daughter's 6th Birthday Present,"This is a wonderful addition to our daughters Elephant collection. Piggy back, travel companion or just a pillow. The moment she opened the box her eyes just gleemed. It was piggy backs all over the house at first. Then it was time to lay down and it was her pillow. She loves it's ears. Ideal to curl up to as well. Over all a great product."
3,DVD should not list in search for Gary Oldman DVDs,"This DVD shows up in searches on Amazon.com, when searches are done for the actor, Gary Oldman. Nowhere, on this DVD is he mentioned or shown.Gary Oldman was in the movie Dracula, but does not appear in this DVD.I had to assign a rating, in order to post this information. I do own this DVD."
4,Revealing,"Dracula is perhaps one of literature's most famous monsters and although many contemporary books and movies have transformed vampires into heartthrobs and prime-time soap stars, Bram Stoker's Dracula remains a true villain. This documentary appears visually to be the work of an amateur, although the actual narrated content proves otherwise. The documentary is extremely well-researched and provides a revealing look into the life of Dracula's creator - Bram Stoker. It explores the influences of gothic and occult cultures and details how these elements appeared in other literary works as well. I think I was introduced to the novel in high school and didn't really give it much thought then. It was fascinating to learn how much time Stoker spent researching to create his legendary character. Vampire fans and literature enthusiasts alike will enjoy this eye-opening Diary of a Vampire."
5,F**kin' awesome!,"Wow, this band is the heaviest thing I've ever heard in my life! How much bass heaviness can you get? This is the album to judge all other metal albums. ""Weird Tales"" just makes me want to go ape s$#t on people. The top of my list."
5,Great Album,"Great Album, DOOOMMMM!!!!!! I feared for my soul after this listening, MUHAhahahahahahaha I think my so8ul is forever compromised, the infection has begun......"
4,Doomthrone,"Yeah,Electric Wizard are the heroes of Doom.Leave thom to the Doomthrone! Smoke an listen.Smoke and listen.Turn up the volume and smoke.Listen and smoke....... My Tips: Funeralopolis,We hate you Check it and Buy it Rock on and SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKE"
4,Boston Politics on the national stage,"A lot was going on in America in the first decade of the nineteenth century.You have New England legislators practicing nullification decades before Calhoun brought it into vogue. You have the southern honor culture gritting its teeth as northerners sought to prevent war with Britain. You have Jefferson signing off on the Louisiana Purchase, which Federalists correctly feared would add to Republican power. You have anxiety from the perception that Napoleon was the natural end to the French Revolution, and the question of who would end the American Revolution. And you have uncertainty over the power and scope of the Federal government.This work tells a remarkable story through the words of state and federal legislators as they sought to sort it all out. Well worth reading."
4,Unusual way to learn history,"Although purportedly about letters, this book is really about some of the most remarkable people and events throughout history. The letters, interesting in their own right, serve more as the jumping off point. Beautifully illustrated and well written, this is a fascinating book which can be sipped a little at a time -- or consumed in a single sitting! Highly recommended for any student of history of the fine art of letter writing."
5,Educational,A fun way for young kids to understand what goes on around them. My three-year-old loves these videos so much. It makes learning fun for him.
1,didn't work,"The blade I needed was for a Stqanley 378 plane and these blades didn't work. Thanks, Rhio"
2,A Missed Opportunity,"Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between. One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have. His comments on childbirth are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural process. This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid. Had the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the result"
3,not for the lay man,"I'm sure this book has a great message, but I couldn't understand it. From Pierce's use of language I might have had an easier time understanding it had it been written in Egyptian heiroglyphics. I hear how amazing this book is and I'm sure it is. Just be wearing your xtra smart hat. I suggest a book by Hygeia Halfmoon instead."
1,Big let down,This CD was a big let down. None of the songs played compare favorably to the originals. Very little soul or imagination in the arrangements of all the songs. All the songs are also short and the endings leave a lot to be desired.
5,Scorchers,"This is a beautiful little film. Small scope, big truth. The action is carried along by the life dramas played out in two locations: a bar and a wedding night bedroom. The exquisite script and superb cast completely overcome some choppy editing and a few technical imperfections."
2,"Did I miss something, I thought it was awful!","I can't believe all the good reviews here. Maybe I was in the wrong mood or something when I saw it. Anyway, as a die-hard Dunaway fan, I had to see this movie as soon as I could. When this movie was released, quite frankly, Dunaway was making really awful films. This movie was no exception. It was dumb and plain boring. It has a pretty good cast which had me hopeful, but it was really, really boring and pointless. I guess if you like small town Louisiana sleaze gossip movies with long boring sections and sets that aren't lit properly (I don't think this was on purpose), and idiotic speeches that I guess are supposed to mean something deep, then see the movie. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. I'll admit it, Dunaway has made some stinkers. On second thought, maybe ""Stinkers"" would have been a better title!"
4,Very useful guide,"Got some great ideas for restaurants, bakeries, breweries, lobster shacks from this book. We agreed with all of his recommendations."
3,satisfactory,Satisfactory purchase - some of the pages were bent down or folded in half - that wasn't a problem - but the city map was gone from the pocket in the back of the book. I really would have liked to have had that map.
2,sins of omission,"No material on 4...Qf6, which other than the main lines 4...Bc5 and 4...Nf6, is, according to more than one online database, one of the next most common continuations. One of those other fourth move responses, 4...Qh4, warrants it own chapter in this book, and two of the others, 4...Bb4+ and 4...g6, warrant illustrative games in the ""Other Black Defences"" chapter. Some might counter that 4...Qf6 usually transposes to 4...Bc5 lines, e.g. 4...Qf6 5. Be3 Bc5, but that is actually all the more reason to cover 4...Qf6: knowing the possibilities for transposition is arguably one of the most important facets in one's opening preparations. Besides, there is certainly some independent significance to 4...Qf6, i.e. 5. Nb3 does not attack Black's Bc5, and after 5. Be3 Qg6 can lead to very sharp but balanced play after 6. Nb5 Bb4+ 7. c3 Ba5."
3,Good Blend of Political Theory and Terrorism Studies - With Some Wrong Conclusions,"Cooper does a great job of applying the theories of two fascinating political theorists, Arendt and Voegelin, with modern day terrorism. The incorporation of Voegelin's pneumopathology and second reality is quite correct.However, where this work loses credibility is its implication that this ""spiritual disease"" is the cause of modern day Salfi/Takfiri extremists. This ""spiritual disease"" is the product of various other social-cultural factors. While Voegelin's work is perfect for describing Takfiri ideology, it does not properly describe the causes of Takfiri terrorism. Voegelin would agree that Islam, like any other religion, is what you make of it."
1,I sent it back it was so bad!,"This product is one of the worst games I have ever played. It was difficult to hook up to the TV because you have to have it run through your dvd player. The back of my dvd player is not all that easy to reach. The song choices are very few and it only had a portion of the songs to sing. It was not even a complete song. After playing it with my 9 year old daughter we packed it up and shipped it back. Don't waste your $. Even if you are a big Idol fan like my family, you will be very disappointed."
5,Great product for the price,"Works great, my daughter loved it. Probably for the younger kids up to about 7 years of age. It is inexpensive so to a degree you do get what you pay for."
1,American Idol - Not,I purchased this product last Christmas for my daughter and within hours it's fun was exhausted because of the limited songs and things that you can do with it.I sent it back immediately and this year I purchased a regular karaoke machine for birthday last Sept it was a far better choice. My kids are 7 and 10 and both love to use the karaoke machine and even I like to get on it once in a while.
3,american idol game my daughter had to have!!,"This was my 12 year old daughter's ""had to have"" thing this past christmas. She was so excited to receive it then...boom! She discovered you can't sing solo without backgrounds from other peolpe, and now hasn't touched it. It would have been nice if they mentioned that in the description before I ordered it. Over all, the service was fast and excellent, but will probably collect dust!"
5,"Wonderful movie, but it seems to have more then one title.","I've enjoyed this movie since the first time I saw it. Imagine my surprise to find it out on DVD. This movie was released more recently under a different title, Leap of Faith. No idea why. But it is nice to see that those of us who do enjoy this movie are able to get it in a nicer DVD case for a much more reasonable price. All I can say is thank goodness I did some digging around and happened to discover this wonderful movie was put out more recently even if under a different title.This is a wonderful movie. Safe for the entire family. There was lessons learned by the main characters; the importance of keeping promises, of learning to trust others and standing up for what you believe in."
3,"Gorgeous as a model should be, but . . .",".This is one of the prettiest dolls that Mattel has created recently. There is a plethora of Top Model dolls available.The problems I think Mattel is having is that they are trying desperately to regain the doll market championship -- I don't think this will happen.Taking the boots off is okay, but putting them back on made me think that mattel put them on and then made the stockings. Impossible, for sure.She comes with a delightful array of items for a top model to be on site in any of a dozen places for a photo shoot.There are so many doll makers now, that for Mattel to regain it's market shares, they must compete in the quality versus quantity race. Why not put out six pink label dolls (standard), 3 gold label, 2 silver label, and 1 grand special, and 2 Silkstone -- at the limitations they have specified.I've been a collector for years, but it is extremely annoying to have a head pop off for no real reason except trying to put a shirt on the doll."
3,Boxes came scratched,"I bought this, and the Barbie Summer dolls on sale, and the doll boxes were so scratched up! They sent me two other ones, but they were no better than the first. Very disappointed in the boxes, they were for gifts. The dolls were pretty."
1,CRAP DON'T WORK,Completely followed the instructions and it did not do anything except make lumpy paint. Kitty litter does better then this stuff
5,MORE RECIPES....HOORAY,"Do you want to use flaxseed for it's wonderful health benefits but just can't find recipes for more than breakfast? This is your book (and mine)- so many recipes, for all kinds of snacks and meals. Well worth the price."
4,High quality product,"It's the top aplication for webdevelopment (wich is what I do). I specialy like the ""SourceSafe"" and ""FoxPro"". But the InterDev is redundant."
2,Ruben Gonzalez a singer?,I couldn't believe the sleeve notes until I heard the record. The recordings were made in 1945 and 1947. Ruben Gonzalez is featured as a singer. I've heard better soud quality from the 40's but nevermind: the recordings are quite interesting because the music as it played in Cuba now really was created in that period. The record is really disappointing from the piano point of view and it should really be stated in the information Amazon gives about this record that RG doesn't touch a piano on this album.
5,Title Track Is Sho'Nuff' Funky,"I discovered this group in 1989 when they released the single ""Make That Move"", the title track of the album(cd). I bought the cassette single and I still play it from time to time. I have to tell you, the track is off the chain. I think it could hold up with the R&B of today, no doubt in my mind. I'm not familiar with the other trax on the album(cd), but I think this is worth buying just for the one track by itself. Who knows, it may have some nice undiscovered music on it, and if any of it has the quality production of the title track then the extra trax are a bonus for buying it."
4,A great book full of true stories from those who lived it !,"This super informative book is a great follow-up to Darryl Young's first book, The Element of Surprise. It is full of stories told by SEALs all the way from Jack Tomlinson, artist of Freddy the Frog, to Chris Caracci of SEAL Team Six. This book descriptively explores topics such as combat reconnaissance, hydrographic surveys, space capsule recovery, submarine lock-ins and lock-outs,and ambush potrols! If you want to know everything you can about the Teams without actually being a SEAL, this is the book for you!"
5,Very pleased,My daughter loves her chair! It's great when they fall a sleep to because their head rest in it perfectly and doesn't fall forward.
1,Didn't work for my almost 4 year old,"We thought this would be a fantastic product, and maybe it is for a larger child. My almost 4 year old meets all the specs on this product, but when she sat in it, she complained of slipping out of the seat. And the 2 times she rode in it, somehow her pants came off her bottom while riding the 20 minutes to her school. We had to return it."
2,A little ackward,"I purchased this booster after reading the rave reviews on this site and because we were very pleased with our Britax Marathon carseat. We are not thrilled with this seat now that it has arrived. The head rest has side wings that come out very far and my 4 year old spends alot of time leaning forward to see around them, thereby negating the safety feature. It also seems very narrow along the torso portion. My daughter is quite thin but still has no room for her arms because of the side wings and so her arms rest on the wings out in front of her body. She has not complained bc the seat is pink and she's never tried another booster but she looks terribly uncomfortable."
3,"Excellent, but somewhat misleading","Based solely on content and quality, this is a five-star product. But I'm an amateur astronomer, and this DVD sets a 'trap' that I'm afraid some are going to fall into.Specifically: You'll see someone looking into a moderately-sized telescope, and the next thing you see is full color, detailed view of some nebula or galaxy or whatever, and I'm here to tell you, this just ain't the way it works. This misleading information turns this 5-star production into a 3-star one (in my opinion), and the sad fact is, there was no need for it.If you like what you see on this DVD, your next step is NOT to go out and buy a telescope. Go to a star party, and check out a variety of telescopes and what you can see through them."
2,"Mildly informative, mostly self-indulgent","Timothy Ferris is to Astronomy as Anthony Bourdain isto Gastronomy. You'll get a light sprinkling of information withan over-sized helping of Ego.Ferris, like Bourdain, is more journalist than expert; althoughthey both wish to feign to be peers of those they admire.That said, the DVD is well produced, well-shot, and paced reasonablywell. For a beginner, it may entice them into the pursuitof amateur astronomy.There is no doubt that Ferris loves the subject and is in awe ofthe Universe and our small place within it.And for that saving grace, I forgive this largely self-indulgentwork.jeff"
1,What time is it?,"This isn't a clock, it's a battery vampire. It would run a few hours and quit. After it did that about 8x with fresh batteries, it dove into the trash and I haven't seen it since. As my grandmother would say,""Good riddance to bad rubbage."""
5,Great relaxation music,"My mom was given this album as a get-well gift after a surgery a number of years ago. She wasn't much into such things, so I ended up keeping it, and I'm glad I did. This album does have the occasional ""That was a little weird"" moment, but even those have grown on me. The grand majority of it all is beautiful, very relaxing. I'd even say the second track is one of the prettiest melodies I've ever heard. This is definitely worth five bucks!"
1,Rust in peace - Notation and Tab mismatched,Upon opening and beginning work on Hangar 18 i was disappointed to find that the notation was correct but unfortunately didn't have matching tab.There were a few errors in notes and incorrect tabbed positions.Well presented book but i'm a bit hesitant to continue through fear of finding more mistakes.
3,"Good for beginers, some inacuracies.","Book has some inaccuracies where notation is correct but the tab doesn't match. Intermediate to Hardcore Guit players will find the errors, beginers probably wont notice. Clearly Mustaine had nothing to do with editing the book as most song ARE played different in concert. Get a used cheap copy...."
4,The Unholy - 1988,"I was young and recall my folks telling my ""No, you may not see this!"" And now I have it here to see all I saw only a moment of as a kid. Not cheesy and not too splatter gory The Unholy is a welcome to my horror movie collection. Used vhs tape--this came quickly and works fine for my purposes. Thanks 4/5 (one point for not being a dvd, if The Unholy ever made it to dvd...anybody ever seen this film on dvd? Dot"
1,One of the worst books ever!,"This is a terrible book. The dialogue is appallingly clumsy and the narration over-basic and repetitive. It is impossible to feel for the characters as you are not fully introduced to them.I spent most of the time I was reading it being completely bored and would have left it if I did not have to do an English literature exam on it.I love reading, but I felt this book was so poor, it was not worth my time."
1,talking in whispers,"this book! well i had to read it in english class, and to be honest i would rather stick a fork in my eye! i was so bored i actually wanted to KILL MYSELF! and when i went home i described the book as being ""crap"" to my mother, i was so tired i couldnt be bothered to speak so i just said crap tons!"
1,Not as good as the original edition,"To my disappointed, this copy is quite different from the orignial copy from my aspects. First of all, the paper quality is different, not as smoothy as the original one.Second, because of the bad paper, this copy is much thicker than the original one.Third, the figures in this book are not as clear as the original ones, which can be noticed clearly by comparing with an original edition.I wonder it is a copy one or just because of different printing companies. Anyway, I do not like this edition.I hope Amazon can update this book as soon as possible."
5,good introductary book,"Good book for students with Math or Physics major. also helpful as a reference book for researchers. It may be too intense for students taking GE courses on Atmospheric Radiation. I'm a Atmospheric science researcher, and this book fits my need perfectly."
4,HappyHardcoreFoundation Re-Packaged,"Anyone recognize those cds? They are HappyHardcoreFoundation, HappyHardcoreFoundation vol.2, and HappyHardcoreFoundation vol.3 just re-packaged. The 1st 2 volumes are pretty much your Happy Hardcore vocal maddness, the 3rd volume just didnt cut it for me, especially with the vocal-less tracks and dull tracks."
4,a Chinese version is published now!,"hello, I want to tell a news about this book.a Chinese version is published now!I am graduated in Law School of Renmin University of China.In college, a professor, doctors and I translated this book into Chinese,we all study Jurisprudence. We try our best to master the spirit of this book and translate accurately.Now the Chinese version is published, we want to let more and more chinese students know it.who can do me a favour?Please send some introduction material of the nature of the common law.please send it to hanguang001@hotmail.com.Wish to learn from your law system and exchange ideas.All best regards."
1,Pure Garbage,"I am a huge fan of all things Python-related, but I can't support this pitiful outing. Terrible story, terrible acting, terrible jokes. I mean, awful. I found nothing even the least bit amusing or engaging about this flick-although admittedly, I turned it off after about 30 or 40 minutes, lest I broke into hives. The only thing I could think was, ""what were they thinking?""...it's like they decided to make a movie, but forgot to write a script; or maybe they were high and thought what they were doing was truly inspired, which of course it was not.This was a very unhappy surprise, given the past and future genius contributions from Gilliam, Jones and Palin. I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if these chaps wouldn't rather forget that they made this turkey. Worst Python-alumni thing ever.~Sun House in Berkeley"
4,Similar to Holy Grail and Life of Brian,"I found Jabberwocky to be very similar to Monty Python's Holy Grail and Life of Brian. In a lot of ways I liked it better. It doesn't have the main Monty Python troupe but it has the laughs. The sub-plots are absurd. The dialogue is incessantly outrageous. The sets, costumes, and make-up are brutally authentic. The dragon-monster featured in the last part of the film is both whimsical and silly. The humor is often dark and silly. There are plenty of joust fights, mis-haps, and zany one-liners throughout the movie. It isn't for young children. But it may appeal to anyone over 16 that has a dark sense of humor and appreciates movies with knights, dragons, non-stop silliness, and absurd sub-plots. Grade: A-"
2,More offbeat than funny,"Every time I go to watch this movie, I remember the last time I watched it, and didn't like it at all. But even after viewing it about 5 times already, I still feel compelled to view it every now and then. It takes a mighty odd film to do that."
2,Disappointing,"I originally saw this movie many years ago as a teen and had fond memories of it. I wish I had not bothered with a second viewing. I am a huge Python/Gilliam/Palin fan, but this one was just way too slow. The laughs are few and far between and there is too much of the same gags over and over. I really wanted to like it."
5,Excellent!!,"Michael Palin at his goofy best. Love this movie! It's funny, satiric and just plain goofy in parts. Lots of fun!"
3,Monty Python and the Holy Potato,"The cover of the DVD says ""From the director of THE FISHER KING and BRAZIL."" This isn't like those films. I've read the reviews that treat it as brilliant, even deep post-Python humor. Humor is notoriously subjective, so I won't say the reviews are wrong about whether it's funny, only that all I saw was minor Monty Python with a coherent story. The story is overwhelmed, as even Gilliam and Palin acknowledge in the audio commentary (though it takes Gilliam a while to come around to it), by the Pythonish gags. I love The Fisher King and quite enjoy Brazil and some of Gilliam's other work, but this film left me stone cold.For what it's worth, the audio commentary with Gilliam and Palin is full of behind-the-scenes stories (some true) and Gilliam's explanations of the many allusions and ideas, for those seeking the well hidden depths of this film."
2,Unfortunately dry comedy with wisps of humour,"Jabberwocky heavily relies on the success of Monty Pythons previous films. Unfortunately, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin failed to mimic the Python essence, leaving one eager for the ending."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This movie is so bad. It's incredibly boring, and not funny at all. This is probably one of the only movies i've ever seen that actually put me to sleep. Skip this and go buy Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That movie is 100x better than this load of garbage.Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)"
4,hilariously quirky,"I remember this movie when it was first released. I have always thought that it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The lead character Dennis Cooper is disinherited by his father and scorned by the woman he loves. Thus, he sets out on his own to make his way in the world. He succeeds beyond his dreams and in the process wins all the things he doesn't want. Fame, adoration of the people and the hand of the princess in marriage. If you get a chance to see this movie or to own the video I highly recommend it."
3,Interesting but a little pretentious,"This is a very thorough, logical and well-researched look into the most influential television programs of the past half-century. The early years are particularly good. That said, it bogs down a little bit in the last third of the book. Everything is a reflection of the Reagan influence, which comes off as a little oversimplified. It's still generally worthwhile, but you won't be crushed when the ending arrives either."
2,Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,"For a book that promises alot, it delivers little. Any book that tries to determine the most important shows is going to be open to dispute, but this book takes what should be an enjoyable experience and turns it into political treatise. If you share the author's world view, then this book has a lot to offer. If you (like me) do not, then you might as well be watching the ""World's Strongest Man"" repeats on ESPN2. Although I won't argue with a majoity of the choices, the rationale for many leaves much to be desired"
1,A Disappointing and Annoying View of the Tube,"For the title and publisher's description of the book, I thought GLUED TO THE SET would be a reasonably enjoyable look at television programs and the culture which surrounded them. What I found was an annoying, over-blown polemic that tried desparately to locate deep sociological, demographic,and cultural trends in EVERY television show selected. The author's quest for meaning frequently stretches both the reader's credulity and patience. Just as a cigar is sometimes just a cigar, sometimes TV programs are just diversion or entertainment, and nothing more. Bob Newhart and Mr. Ed are entertainments, not cultural icons or symptons of a mass media-driven societal decline."
4,"Fun build, but...","I bought this for my girlfriend because she loves the space shuttle so much. I mean, when she watches it launch, or land or whatever she gets so excited it makes her cry. I got her this for her birthday.I helped her build it (it was her first lego experience), and it's on display on a bookshelf now.I guess for the purpose I bought it I'm a little disappointed because all it does is sit there--all the fun was in building it. I don't think she'll want to take it apart and build it again--it will probably just stay there on the shelf.Anyway, this is probably a much better gift for a kid--even if your girlfriend is REALLY crazy about the shuttle."
3,The Marriage of Figaro,"So I read this for my theatre history class and thoroughly enjoyed it. The ideal it proposes, or doesn't propose still are up for debate and intensely relavent for today. For a fully analysis read my post here: [...]"
4,Opera student's perspective,"We are doing this in opera form this Spring, and it was very helpful to read the play, especially the Barber, to get the background necessary for a complete performance. The notes and the biography also added to my understanding of the play."
5,Delivers exactly what the title promises.,"This is one of those rare occasions where the booktitle is spot-on. As a developer, I needed some guidance into the world of Email protocols (without ploughing through these tedious RFC's and standards) and this book delivered. Clear, easy to read and to-the-point.Tip for the author: The book is time-sensitive, be sure to have a V2.0 somewhere next year.Tip for the publisher: How about a similar book on Web-protocols (http, ftp, nntp)?"
4,The topic is dynamite,"Six months ago there were no books on how to program email using standard protocols. Now there are three! Kevin Johnson, John Rhoton and David Wood have all brought out excellent books on the subject. My only gripes with this book are that it leaves out in-depth explanations, scatters material through the chapters and contains too many errors. If your budget is tight just get Rhoton's book and a copy of the RFCs, but if you are serious about this stuff you are going to need all three books as well as all the mail RFCs."
2,"Good info, but poorly organized","I found this book to be informative, but confusingly written. The author also makes assumptions on the reader's knowledge which people already not familar with programming e-mail apps will find annoying. Not for the beginner."
4,Great resource! - even for beginners who want to LEARN,"This book is a great resource of knowledge on DBI - in all respects. The topics are covered in a thorough manner, and a plethera of code exists for DBI.This is a good book for programmers who want to know WHAT they are doing, HOW it works, and WHY it works. Although it has all the information to do database transactions with Perl, it is not a ""DBI for dummies"" book, and will not function as such. Those looking for a easy way to do SQL from Perl can use the online assistance if they are very familiar with database connections and want to learn by trial and error. Else, grab this book, a cup of your favorite thought-inducing beverage, and enjoy! (Don't get the beverage in the keyboard!)"
5,Computer Privacy Handbook Changed My Life!,"After listening to Andre Bacard interviewed on the radio, I bought and read COMPUTER PRIVACY HANDBOOK. This book blew my mind! It taught me how very naive I've been about what Bacard calls our ""Surveillance Age"" -- in particular the Internet. At first I thought this book was about computers. Actually, it is about human relations and freedom from tyranny. I've told a number of my friends to read this book and, then, to check the privacy links at http://www.andrebacard.com. After reading Computer Privacy Handbook, I've taken several steps. First, I never surf the web without using a service such as www.freedom.net. Second, I use encryped email and/or www.hushmail.com for my email. I have yet to figure out how to protect my financial and medical privacy, but I'm working on that. Thank you, Mr. Bacard, for changing my life!"
3,Any Human Heart,"Despite the good acting, cinematography, etc., I did not care for the storyline. Seems to be the sad tale of a man desperately seeking some sense of self via sexual encounters with various women (This includes a 16 year old, albeit unknowingly), and hapless ""assignments"" that he willingly takes on. He does seem to approach something close to love in his relationship with Freya, but then continues on in his strange conquesting way. The man seems to be searching for meaning in his life, but never quite finds it. Quite sad."
2,another disappointment,"Trying, slow moving, boring, takes forever to get anywhere... very disapponted in this one.. wish I'd saved my money. I trend towards BBC and British fare...this one is not up to par."
1,"Trash, Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I bought this movie because it was a BBC Masterpiece Classic. Most Masterpiece movies I have seen are not vulgar. It was not rated (NR), so I took the chance on buying it. Because of Masterpiece Classic ratings especially in the language category. I started to look at it, and I couldn't believe what was said. I couldn't wait to dump it in the garbage. The filthy words was too much to bare. I just got to the first vulgar word spoken in the movie and that was enough for me. I exit the movie so fast someone would have thought my hands were on fire. Better to burn my hands now then to allow the soul to burn eternally.It is not a movie that (some adults) care to look at. This movie should be rated so people will know it's rated R, and beyond. This review was written and rated for (those) that have a heart for GOD."
3,THERE'S NO FINAL CHAPTER!!! PART OF THE SERIES IS MISSING.,"I'd seen this series originally on Netflix--the complete series. I really loved this story even though there's a lot of personal tragedy in the main characters life, so I wanted to buy it--great acting, great costumes, great story. After watching my DVD to the end I was extremely disappointed: there was no final chapter-Part 5! spoiler alert--it's the last part of his life after the car crash! They never show the end, his retirement years. So, I think there should be a class action lawsuit--I paid for the whole series, I should get the whole effin series. Very disapointed--would have given the dvd 5 stars if the whole series was on it, but it wasn't, frown.For what its worth..."
4,I love British television series.,"This series is no exception to my title for the review.Matthew MacFadyen stands out as he always does for me as an actor with a wide range of abilities.The story line is good,sad,happy,and at times make you wince when you see the train wreck coming.Long as usual,but worth the time spent watching."
2,Technical problems,"I bought this DVD because I was impressed with Ghislaine Thesmar's commentary in the ""Etoiles"" documentary on the Paris Opera Ballet but had never seen her dance. I'm still not sure I have seen her dance, because there were no close-ups and the picture was, as another reviewer noted, fuzzy. The audio problems were not simply a matter of recording but also of the musical performance itself. The orchestra, band, or whatever provided the accompaniment was not identified-- for good reason. Rather than give this DVD five stars with a caveat about drawbacks, I think it is more accurate to give it two stars with the qualification that those interested in performances with ""historical value"" may rate it higher."
4,Good stuff..,"As one of the only singles released from their latest album ""Against"", Sepultura proves beyond a doubt that they can still lay down some mad grooves. This CD's great for any collection, and also for someone looking for something new. Check this one out."
5,Nice Rack!,"Very nice looking pot rack. Lots of storage space. Easy to install (did it myself, and it hasn't fallen down yet!). Gives the kitchen a new look. We love it."
4,subliminal message of good music,Wish this was around 10 years ago when my daughter was a baby!I Gave it as a gift to my nephews hoping to give them subliminal messages of good music in their sleep!
1,disappointing,"I heard the Rockabye Baby CD of ColdPlay at a store recently and loved it. I bought the U2 CD because I love U2 and thought I'd like it even more than the ColdPlay one. It sounds all the same and the music is very ""tinkly"". I would not suggest it."
5,Great children's bedtime music that won't annoy adults,"These Rockabye cds are great. We have about 6 of them. We buy the one's that are of the bands we like. That way the kids listen to them before bed and we don't mind because we are singing the words in our heads to our favorite songs. Who ever created these is ingenious. No words and the music is changed just enough to make it sound kid friendly yet is so true to the original songs that you can't help humming along. Not too mention when a song comes on some where else I find my oldest humming along. It is so cool. I recommend all of these cds. Buy your favorite band, the kids will love it."
5,Great for new mommy,Bought this for a girlfriend when she had her son. She is a huge U2 fan and has absolutely loved introducing her son to the band. Great gift!
3,"""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" - NOT!","As a U2 fan of over 18 years, 15 concerts, a trip to Ireland, and a U2 tattoo, I have over 100 U2 CDs (singles, imports, bootlegs, rarities, and what not) and thought ""what the heck"".After two times listening to the full album, I still get confused and messed up during the songs. I appreciate the attempt to ""get"" U2 but I think the same thing could have been achieved by listening to wind chimes or banging a pipe.Of all the ""non-U2"" items out there, this is probably the weakest. Other non-U2 U2 items, such as ""Strung out on U2"", ""In the Name of Love"", ""We Will Follow:Tribute to U2"", and ""Pickin' on U2"", and so on all do U2 better justice and actually resemble the songs.Bottom line: As a real U2 fan, add it to the collection. As someone who wants to slowly introduce your baby to U2, throw on ""The Joshua Tree"" or make a mix CD of their slower songs."
1,"Gosh, how awful!",I am a huge U2 fan and thought this would be a nice lullaby CD for the baby's room or for long car rides. I put the CD in the car one time and turned it off after 10 minutes. The music just gets on your nerves! You are better off with Baby Einstein's classical lullaby CD--much nicer and the baby loves it too.
3,"Good, but not great",I fell in love with the Coldplay Rockabye Baby! CD and thought the U2 would be as good. It's not; it's decent but not spectacular. Die hard U2 fans might really enjoy this more than a casual fan like myself.
5,Great for babies and their parents!,Love these cds!! Great music for babies and songs their parents already know and love!
4,The Wandering Minstrels CD,"This is another of my old 33 1/3 records that I tried to replace. I was pretty happy with the CD. It has a lot of bonus songs. Unfortunately, they are in languages I don't always understand and so far, not too many have resonated with me."
3,Just Like Old Times,"Fond memories of the Folk era can back when I listened to this CD. It was such a sweet time to remember, before we lost our innocence. Happy to add it to my collection."
3,Shouldn't this burn DVDS?,"I am upset with my burner's apparent inability to burn movie files onto any of the 16X DVD-R's that I bought in bulk for it. CD's and other slower speeds of DVD-R's play and burn just fine, however now I'm stuck with 200 DVDs that my burner can't work with."
1,This is a waste of money,"This product only work for burn around 6 dvd's in two weeks.suddenly when i going to play a movie, give me an error and never works again.i don't undertand because i have at my office and i didn't move it.just simply stops.don't waste your money as i do."
1,Mine broke,"Recently, I have noticed that my drive is making a strange clicking noise when the tray is open. The drive no longer reads disks either!"
2,Broke after 3 months,"It worked well for 3 months then died on me. I don't think it's made anymore, but just in case used ones are around I can't recommend it"
5,firewire sold this to me,"I bought this for my old mac laptop because it had fire wire and was fast at the time. It's still pretty fast. I don't use it much anymore now that my new macbook has a burner, but when I did, I made a lot of movies, and quickly."
1,I wish I was dead,"AAAHHHH the 80's! Duran Duran, Karate Kid, Birth of Capitalism. Can you tell any subject of the 80's that wasn't horrible ( without using the words IRON MAIDEN! )? Nena is the proove that the 80s were the worst decade ever, she is the musical equal to the intentions of ""American Psycho"". In my ears, the sound of a table that gets scrathed by 4 inch fingernails is less uncomfortable than hearing her voice. Oooh, what a great vocalist that somehow manages to be more annoying in every song I hear of her. Oooh, what an original Band! The background music is more elevator-style than anything else, and could be created by 2-year olds. I live in Germany where she comes from, and she/it makes me hate this place even more. Avoid, unless you still think that the 80s were cool!!"
4,Needs better clasp,It is a beautiful piece for the money but my daughter almost lost it when the clasp opened up unexpectedly. maybe a saftey chain of some sort would help.
2,Not for a Giant Cypress,"We got this carrier to attach to my Giant Cypress. The included hardware does not work with the seat attachment on the Cypress, so I got a 1/4"" bolt to use with the seat adjustment mechanism. However, then the frame was too thick to attach the bottom portion of the carrier to. At that point, I gave up, since I was pretty sure it would ruin the struts to make them fit. If your bike frame is thick and/or not round, you may want to think twice about this child carrier."
4,Good Pr,My 2 year old daughter loves this bike seat. She always wants to ride the bike and now we can. She's on the petite side so this seat is fine if she were a bigger child I think this seat would be a tight fit.
3,Wouldn't attach,"I bought this as a cheap option that would let me try out riding with my kid. I have a Specialized Hard Rock that has a quick-release seat post that is incompatible with the seat.The instructions call for a bolt attachment on the rear part of the seat post, so if you don't have that it won't work out. The bottom brackets attach via friction/clamping onto the lower diagonal wheel legs that should work on any bike, but the seat post is the deal breaker. Hope it works better for you."
2,Don't buy unless you have a cruiser!,I bought this carrier to mount to a new mountain bike with dual suspension. It does not fit it and is going back to the store. I am new to biking for recreation and no where in my Mongoose manual NOR the BELL manual did it say not to use it for this type of bike. I went to a specialty shop for advice. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT unless you have a cruiser type bike.....there are no guidelines as to which bikes it will fit. I am going to have to decide on a center mounted seat or a trailer if I want the whole family to go for a ride together.
3,"Works fine, but with a few issues","Now that it's installed, it works fine and I am reasonably happy with it. I also find it useful for carrying stuff in (e.g. backpack) when I ride without the baby.Issues:1. It replaces the screw used to loosen the bike seat (not baby seat) to change its height. The replacement was not compatible with either of my bikes, and even after replacing it with different screws from the hardware store, it took some hands-on ingenuity to get it to tighten my bike seat. For a few days, my seat kept slipping down.2. My bike is large (I am over six feet tall) and it just barely fits. It is very close to interfering with the rear brake pads.3. The straps securing the child don't seem to have enough parts to keep it tight; the strap can slip through the buckle.All in all, I would have bought a different baby seat if I had known the issues with this one, but now that I have it, it does the job well enough."
3,Needed a little work,"The classic Child Carrier Seat is an ok seat for the price. I wouldn't expect it to last over a couple children. One child, as fast as they grow it it acceptable. I had to modify the carrier by extending the attachment arm to the seat. The provided attachemnt was too short, putting the carrier almost against my seat. I couuldn't even attach the bar assembly."
4,Great product but hard to install,"I am really pleased with this product. It's great value and seems plenty sturdy and safe to me. It feels very secure on my bike and my son really likes it. It was VERY hard to install, lots of tweaking but I figure you get this when a product is 'universal.' It all fitted eventually and I am very satisfied and have no concerns over safety. I have a 26"" mountain bike with only a 16"" frame, so this product works well for smaller bike frames too!"
3,Baby seat-bike,Arrived 5 days after promised but so far so good. Ended up being too complicated for me to assemble myself so I had to have a bike shop put it together for me. Anyone who is good at this type of assembly can do it though. Very pleased!
2,You get what you pay for.,"I should have known better! A cheap, flimsy piece of junk. My daughter is only 25 lbs but my heels and her toes keep crashing together with seat as far back as it will go. Returning this and saving some $$ for a better carrier!"
2,FAIL!!!,"I bought this to put on my women's mountain bike so that when my husband and I go out on rides together with the 2 kids, I could put my 2 year in this, and he could use the double bike cart for our older son (who isn't old enough for a bike but too big for one of these). I put it together myself and noticed after just step one (putting the bottom brackets on) that there was a problem... the bars are completely warped and crooked. Well, I take that back. It was only one that was warped. I continued to put it together, then took it out to put on the bike... and I just couldn't make it work. I may have my husband try again later, but I will probably just take it back and wait until I can afford something better."
2,Dont cheap out like i did,It works. But it was not worth saving 30 bucks compared to some other options out there. I am handy and its hard to put togeather. My bike seat has a quick release and it requires a traditional seat tightening system. I had to go to the hardware store to jerry rig that connection with a pipe bracket and a Bolt and a nut. 3 dollars worth of stuff but still anoying and hard. Every part was hard. once all togeather it does work though. thanks mike
1,Lack of specifications,"After two days of trying to make it work, we are returning this. It does not fit on my husband's mountain bike, my hybrid/town bike, or my mother's cruiser.Nowhere on the box, the instructions, or the company's website could I find a list of bicycle types that would work with this carrier. I went to a bicycle shop and was told the bolts provided to attach it to the bike are very large and not standard for any of the bikes he'd seen. After reading reviews, other people have also had this issue. It would be very nice of BELL to provide a list of bicycle types that would fit this carrier, instead of the ""fits most bikes"" nonsense. It would have saved us a lot of time and hassle.If you decide to buy this carrier, I recommend that you contact the company first to find out if this will work for your bicycle type."
1,Connot be used with bikes that have suspension seat posts,"We bought this from Walmart and tried to install it on my trek 7100. But after a while we found that we couldnt fasten the seat to the seat post with the hardware provided. When we sent Bell a message on Facebook (because the link to contact them on their website was not working), we got back a reply from them saying that this seat is not for bikes with suspension seat post."
3,It's sort-of ok...,"I slaved over assembling this seat over the weekend and finding a way to attach it to my bike.I have a mountain bike with a quick-release seat...so finding a spot to bolt the bracket to was not easy. I ended up leaving two pieces of metal off of my bike seat, using a different bolt to attach the bracket. The missing metal pieces make my seat move around a bit. I had no problem attaching the bottom arms to the lower bike frame.Tried a twirl around the driveway before putting my 2 year old in...new problem, the handlebar cut me in the back. So, I took that off.New helmet and securely strapped into her seat, we went for a ride around the neighborhood. She's tall for a 2 year old, so her knees were bumping me in the butt. She didn't seem to mind and asked for more, but by the time I had assembled and drove around...I was exhausted."
4,Gets the job done,"This is a very basic seat. You pay for what you get. The installation of the foot guards was tricky and they are flimsy. Otherwise, I installed two of these seats releatively quickly on both of our bikes. There is a 40 pound limit on these. So our three year old will max that out shortly so we didn't want to spend the money on fancier seats, but I think I would've bought ones that were a little nicer if I had physically seen them in person first. Nonetheless. They work fine and get the job done. If you are a safety-paranoid parent, then spend a little more on another seat. Our seats only get used while we are on vacation in Nantucket."
3,a little uncomfortable,My daughter love it but now my seat can't attach properly. It would probably be ok for a taller person.
4,Not bad for the money,"The seat is very easy to install. Probably took less than 30 minutes. We haven't used it a lot but it works just fine. I need to see what the weight limit is because the last time we used it, it seemed to be swaying back and forth a little bit. The plastic is not very thick and at 35 lbs, our kid might have outgrown it, but it was just fine when he was a little smaller."
4,Good seat for the value!,"I am very please with this seat for the price I paid. I installed the seat on my husband's old bike, took about half an hour. It seems to hold my 2 1/2 year old, he's 31 lbs and 37 inches. I think the foot hold is a little shallow, my son's feet keep slipping out. One side of the seat belt strap was very hard to put through. Otherwise, its good for occasional use and get the little one used to riding."
2,Nice try,"Typical minimalist prose novel marketed to pomo urbanites. Some of the characters are interesting and on the whole the book was vaguely entertaining. However the ""plot"" (was there one?) was cookie cutter cliched and unsatisfying. The good part was that I was able to tear through this book in an afternoon since the writing is in no way adorned with literary devices or descriptions."
4,"three fourths grace, one fourth ashes","I liked this book. The prose, the elliptical storylines, the way the characters interacted. Arlene is the owner of a small shop in Providence. Her daughter Taylor is beautiful but lost. Her brother Charlie is HIV+ and living in New York with his lover, Isak, whose gender identity is fluid. All the characters were clear and well-defined except for Taylor - the only character narrated in the third person. The passages dealing with her are awkward and clunky, as if the author wrote a short story about her and then stitched it into the rest of the book. It doesn't help that Taylor is the weakest character - she's beautiful but shallow, and I didn't like her much until the end of the novel. But Isak, Charlie and (to a lesser extent) Arlene stayed with me. I would definitely read more by T Cooper."
3,"Sad, sad people","The four characters of this book lead sad lives. You have ""beautiful"" freeloading Taylor, who doesn't do anything for herself, because her looks will take care of everything for her, Arlene, the depressed divorcee, bitter, dying Charlie, and Isak the heartless hustler. What sad and horrible people. We never know just how ""beautiful"" Taylor is because she's never really described. Her story is the only one told in third person, the other three are in first person. We only get to see her through everyone else's eyes.I give this book three stars becuase it is an interesting read, though there's nothing spectacular about the wiritng and the characters are constantly complaining about how pathetic they are. Despite that, they're interesting. Sad, but interesting."
2,Could have been great...,"I bought this dvd along with the book - I like a visual aid to exercise with, as it keeps a flow, and helps ensure you're doing things properly - and a text sometimes gives you deeper info. I found the book good, lots of info there. The DVD could have been good, but it is too difficult to follow along for a total beginner. There is no commentary whatsoever. Which means that even when you should be looking another way, you have to watch the screen constantly to know if it's time to do something else. I have an enormous collection of workout DVDs, and this has one of the laziest productions I have ever seen. With the technology available on DVD, there should have been an option to have a voiceover or not. Thus, one could learn with the voiceover, and later practice without it for a more zen session. I though at the very least there would be titles on the screen each time a new movement was introduced, but no, nothing..... pity. I shall have to stick with my Garripoli DVDs."
3,Not a Stand-Alone Product,"I first bought the book Qigong for Staying Young and then felt that I needed to see the exercises being done to get them exactly right, so I ordered the DVD. On the DVD, the author demonstrates the session, but without any instruction at all, no explanation of how the breathing should coordinate with the movement, or of the visualizations mentioned in the book. The viewer is left to guess at what the healing sounds are if it's not entirely clear from Katzman's pronunciation. It would have been ideal as a previous reviewer mentioned, if there was a soundtrack guiding you through the first times that could then be shut off, but as it is, it is inadequate by itself to understand the exercises, and in light of this, $25 is far too much to pay for the DVD. It should have been packaged together with the book. That all being said, I do like the workout very much...."
2,Terrible,As a long time martial artist and Qigong practitioner; I have to say this DVD is awful. In the warm up section the hip rotations are done far too quickly and the demonstrator looks really stressed out.The woman doesn't say one word throughout the entire DVD! There are many good Qigong DVD's; this is not one of them.
5,Sid~,"I bought this as a gift for a little cousin. I like the idea of the subjects that Sid, the Science Kid discusses for the little children. The music is good as well."
5,Thank u,U made my little gir so happy Thank u............... she was so happy to have a new movie. can t find them in the stores. look forward to more orders
4,The Romance Reunion,"It's so funny to come on Amazon and read reviews of books that I've read years ago, under the same circumstances as the other reviewers!! ...I found a copy of ""Savage Surrender"" in an old bookshelf in my parents' house, along with ""Love's Tender Fury"" by Jennifer Wilde. They were the first romance novels I ever read, and both made quite an impression on me. ""Savage Surrender"" was definitely the more violent and haunting of the two--filled with many graphic rape scenes and even a branding. I also read ""Immortal Beloved"" by Natasha Peters and enjoyed it.My dad found all the old books in that bookcase recently and donated them to a used bookstore. It broke my heart. I think I'll search for them again."
2,Warning! Really savage!,"The heroine in this book is the most battered woman in all the books I've ever read. You would think Ginny in SEET SAVAGE LOVE has endured everything imaginable. Well, Elise here outdid her!Let's see. Violently deflowered by the so called ""hero"" who mistook her for a peasant girl. Tricked into a false marriage. Raped by a vile pirate captain, gang raped by his crew, then miscarried. Lived as Jean Lafitte's mistress. Raped and reaquired by hero. Met hero's jealous wife. Raped by hero's brother-in-law. Sold as a quadroon slave. Raped, beaten, and resold many times over. Hunted and branded! Forced by the hero to spy and sleep with another. Raped by the hero and got preganant again. Inprisoned and tried as a spy. Returned home to raise child alone...The auther is talented and the characters were well drawn. This is her first book, and none of her other ones are as savage."
1,ugh,i just could not get into this book I have never read a story that the herione went through what this girl did i thought it was a little over the edge. I quit it after pg 212. this is my opinion i had heard good reviews on it and decided to try it out.
1,READ IF YOU ENJOY RAPES AND BEATINGS DESCRIPTIONS,"I only read parts of this book and threw it down. I had borrowed it from someone else. I would never buy trash like this. I had no idea of the real content of the book until I began to read it. Yeah, I expected sex descriptions but not rape and torture! I would give this garbage a -10 on a scalle of 0-10. Pure trash.So if you are sick-minded enough to enjoy descriptions of beatings, rape and torture then by all means, read it!The entire story is completely stupid. Never understood how a woman could ""fall in love"" with a man who raped and beat her repeatedly. NASTY!"
5,SAVAGE SURRENDER,THIS WAS MY FIRST ROMANCE BOOK I EVER READ AND GUESS WHAT? I HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. THEN I READ THE SEQUEL DANGEROUS OBESSION AND IT WAS GREAT TOO.
4,2 very stubborn people but a very good read packed with action,"I read reviews on this book before I purchased it and many said the same as I will. It was a great book, a real page turner with tons of action and a super good story. I did grow tired of the resistance they both put up to just say they loved each other sooner. I was dissapointed in Elise that she didn't tell Garth about the child at the end and he was 3 before he got to see his Dad. I knew they would get together in the end but it sure took right to the last page to see it come to fruition. Over all I loved the story and it brought out all forms of emotion from me from crying to being mad to laughing with joy. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the old school romance with lots of action and a fiery heiroine."
2,cloaca maxima,"This book contains about fifteen percent useful information. The rest is made up of stories about colon cleansing, the politics of same, testimonials, etc. While the author's enthusiasm is hard to beat, she only touches on the basis of a clean system: whole grains, veggies, plant protein, etc. Colon cleansing will not undo years of abuse, and the best way to avoid the consequences is by eating in a colon - friendly way, that is, like a Vegan.Cleanse if you like - it's better than nothing, and probably won't hurt. But the optimum way to optimum health is an intelligent diet."
3,5 Star music on a 2 Star CD,"The music is great. The Hollies are definitely a 5-star band but this review is on the CD, not the songs or the band. The CD is copy protected and upon inserting it into my PC immediately begins to try to install ""required updates"" to my Media Player. I don't want every CD I own installing its own patches to Media player so it can control how I use the CD. I have never stolen, borrowed, copied, or loaned someone else my CD's or taken copies of theirs and I do not want copy protected CDs.The concept brings to mind the problems my wife has with her ebooks on Microsoft Reader. Her PC decides, often randomly or arbitrarily, whether or not she can read the books she paid for. I don't want my CDs doing the same thing.Finish your CD libraries soon before the copy protection takes away you right to listen when and where you choose."
2,No result,"It was a good deal for the money. However, I used this natural concoction thinking it would be better than the chemicals with hydroquinone; unfortunately, I didn't see any difference after 3 months. I will not buy it again."
5,An Action Packed Plot Makes For Great Reading,"The incredible writer Robert Elmer has really outdone himself on this one. The roller coaster of ups and downs provides the reader with a set of emotions different from any other book. Just when you think the plot has settled back down, it throws you right back into suspense. For example, right after they receive the phone call it seems like they're not going to the island. Then in the next chapter the reader is surprised to find them going to Bornholm. The climax and ending are so good it's very hard to put the book down.The details of the book are also superb. When they have the problem on the way back to Bornholm it's almost as if you're there. I recommend this book as well as the whole Young Underground Series to readers who love conflict and adventure."
5,Great another item,My daughter really enjoys these books. Add these types of books to your personal library. They will be a treasurer in future.
5,This movie never gets old,"Rambling Rose is one of my favorite movies....it captures the never-ending power of kindness and love. The mother figure is the most powerful for she is steadfast in recognizing the ""creative force of the universe""."
4,Good movie,"This used to be one of my fav movies. I still like it, though. My fav scene is when dixieland is playing and shes walking down the sidewalk attracting attention. I like her character, simple but just stirs everybody up and causes controversy without ever doing enything. I get a kick out of this movie and it was really good for the time it was made."
2,Rent it if you must,"There was a movie to be made here, but this is the worst kind of ""Hollywood does the south"" nonsense. Dern's ""accent"" alone was repellent in addition to a sexual scene with a VERY young boy which will doubtless make some viewers quite queasy. How could a cast this good render such trashy gibberish? Only thing that could have redeemed this at all would have been much more nudity on Dern's part."
2,nondescript,"Good acting but overall the movie is quite boring. This poor family is constantly trying to keep this ditsy loose girl out of trouble. They've charitably taken her in and of course she shows her appreciation by going after the hubby which was done so embarrassingly stupid. The entire movie is centered around this silly girl character. Ending seems kind of sad but I wish I never bought it! Gone With The Wind doesn't even cost that much and it is 1,000 times over the movie this one is!!!"
1,Nepotism does not make for good moviemaking,"It must be nice to have daddy get you into the movies, but enough is enough. Laura Dern simply cannot act. That, combined with her gawky physical appearence, doom this film. I would feel sorry for her but for the fact that she has made it rich as an actress thanks to her dad's influence and reputation.A moderately intersting story line. Pleasant musical score. But c'mon, there must be better talent in Hollywood than this."
1,boring,"boring, boring and 1000 times boring. Why do you wanna expend your money in such a boring film?"
1,Didn't work at all.,"My washer had some kind of hard, scaly build up, and I thought it was from hard water deposits. I poured the entire Washer Magic bottle in my washer and ran several cycles with hot water, but none of the deposits were removed. Maybe my washer has something other than normal hard water scaling. I may have to try thinning solvents."
4,good buy,"My kids really enjoy this bridge, and love that it's a real landmark. It fits perfectly with our Thomas track."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was one of the worst travel guides I have ever purchases. I though so much of this book I placed it where it belongs, in the trash can. If you want a real travel guide purchase DK eyewitness travel guides."
5,Dottie Dodgion Sings....Superbly!,"I chanced upon this CD just today and am so excited to have a chance to here such an amazing voice. These 13 standard tunes are handled with style and a wonderful sense of feeling. Where has this woman been all my life?!!If you enjoy great singing, buy this recording. Johnny Varro, also new to me, plays piano with such ease, my breath is taken away; the other musicians are also top notch. Don't analyze, just enjoy this ""ear candy"".My choice for jazz vocalist of this,or any other year."
1,rip off,it is outrageous the price they are asking for this here. when you can buy the book from the author's web site for $97.00. still better than the $300.00 they were asking for last time. that's why i gave this one star not because of the content.
4,good book,"I bought this book for my prek 3 class for our lesson on safety. the book covers many different safety topics, so I will be able to use this many times. thats great! the pictures are cute, very informative book."
3,Scared me as a kid,I read this book when I was little and it scared me. As a small child I found a few of the pages to be too graphic. The Messages were good some a little to over cautious. I don't remember if I learned from this book or from being told safty rules over and over. Please read this book first before giving to your childern.
1,Don't waste your money,This book was incredibly disappointing. The book offers nothing to distinguish itself. It is hardly anything more than a collection of stories with a few questions at the end of each story. No creativity involved at all.
1,Didn't work...,"My mom's hybrid bike always gets flats - I installed the 'Stop Flats' with big hopes of never having a flat again!!She got a flat 2 months later, riding probably 10 miles a week on city streets. And by the way, this is my 60+ mom, who leisurely rides - not an off roader.In any case, maybe I installed it wrong - but I did put in brand new tubes with these, so not very happy. Will probably try kevlar tires instead."
4,Thorough and Serious,"This is a very serious commentary. The volume is extremely thorough and introduces the book of Galatians for so long you would want to start skipping pages after a while. The work is very technical and very scholarly and not intended for an average reader. It is detailed and heavily theological, expecting the reader to be a specialist, a linguist, familiar with classics, theology proper, rhetoric and biblical criticism systems. I am not sure how it is useful for sermon prep, because it is so technical. Unless you like to read the technical data for a month prior before interacting with the living faith issues in Galatians and real problems among people that are usually not connected with academic arguments. I think for what it is the volume is well written for a scholarly commentary. It is good for reference to problematic passages for sure. Still it is most suitable for scholars and theologians in my opinion."
4,Classic Cuban Music,"A great musician, whose songs are mentioned in Ry Cooder's book of Los Angeles stories. He's now somewhat obscure, except for historical fans, but he deserves wider recognition. This is the music scene the Buena Vista Social Club folks came from. Wonderful music, but understandably not the cleanest sound quality.."
3,Good author - bad editor,"The version of this book I have is produced by Sutton Publishing in the UK. The book is extremely interesting and enjoyable to read. Unforuntely, Sutton's editors could not be bothered to actually proof the work. There are numerous misspellings and typographical errors; almost one for every three pages!"
5,Superlegal!,"Many people hate pagode, and this CD is an example of what they consider to be the worst of it. It's not what they expect ""good music"" to be, so they dismiss it as ""junk."" But I think they are missing what is so wonderful about it: energy, spirit, ""vontade de cantar."" Pagode is more than just the latest simplistic Afro-Brazilian music fad, and Desejos is a fantastic group. Marcio Duarte, who sings most of the songs, is a remarkable vocalist. Although he still lacks maturity and consistancy, he sings with intelligence and has an incredible sense of how to place a sound in time. I don't like junk. There is very little popular music I can stand to listen to. I love this CD."
4,Sterling silver charm,"This picture really does not do the palm tree justice. It is very detailed and looks very nice. I gave it to my sister for her birthday, and she loves it - wears it all the time. Was also priced well."
1,How to dance off the beat?,"This workout DVD is AWFUL if you have even the vaguest notion of how to move to a beat. The dance moves are ok (I guess, I couldn't stnd to make it through the entire DVD), but there is no real music behind the workout, and the even the pathetic bit of beat that's provided in NOT IN SYNC WITH THE DANCERS! It was incredibly frustrating - just about get the moves down at slower speed, trying to move with both the instructor AND the music, but you and she (along with here backup group) are obviously moving to a different drummer. The moves and the music (if you call it that) are half a beat out of. Just frustrating to no end."
1,Very hard to follow,"I really wanted to enjoy this workout DVD, as I am a big fan of Hip Hop and Ballroom DVDs, so I thought putting them together would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is that none of her cuing is in reverse, which is an industry standard. Normally, in a dance DVD, the instructor will tell you to move to the left while moving to her right. So, you will move to your left as instructed and ""mirror"" the instructor. Unfortunately, Lisa doesn't do this. It makes it really difficult to follow. If you follow her voice cues, you won't be following the TV. Unfortunately, it just makes for a very frustrating experience and I wasn't able to finish the workout."
5,One of the best,"This is a really excellent, accurate, and carefully researched guide, full of helpful information. Note however that it is not BY Arthur Frommer, who publishes a magazine and lends his name to the series, but no longer writes guide books--the author is Beth Reiber. She is right on top of her subject, and you couldn't ask for a better, more complete guide to Hong Kong."
1,I have never hated a guidebook until I got this one,"I have gotten at least four Frommer's guidebooks before and it's always been quite good. Until I got this one, the first ever NOT in the Day-By-Day series. What a huge mistake. First, this book doesn't have a street level view of the entire area. You know, the one they always have in the Day-By-Day book? Then everything is pink. Not exactly color map, but pastel pinkish maps. It is so hard to look at it. I don't think I have ever gotten pissed off from a guidebook before, but this one definitely got to me. Finally, there is no picture... of anything. Just lots of words. I don't want a guidebook with words! I'd get a history book in that case. I don't want to look for words in a paragraph when I'm lost in Hong Kong! I want pictures, maps, characters that'll help me find things ASAP. I'm done venting about this book. Just don't get this book. I'm returning it right now."
3,Summary Review,"Although this book covers almost all the subjects related to house design & construction, it seems to need more rework especially on the last sections (Chapter 8 and ahead). For instance in Chap. 10 (pages 305-315), it hardly describes the type of doors and windows, without providing any further information about recommended sizes and thickneses."
1,Fat Cat refused to eat them,...and Napoleon will eat pretty much anything. Including some dried up cilantro that was on my kitchen floor just now. Gross.
5,Just open the lid and they'll come a running!,"I have recently switched my cats to a raw food diet. It is a slow process because they have been used to the commercial canned foods and all the added teasers to get cats to eat. I ordered these once before and forgot how much the cats loved them as treats, so when I saw them again, I knew if these were sprinkled on top of the raw food, they might go for the ""new"" food easier. It worked and the cats are eating more raw food than canned (because you have to add some canned to the raw in the beginning). My experience so far with raw feeding my pets is it is well worth the research to find out what exactly to feed and which supplements are required. Once you know it is not really alot of work to do because you make large batches and freeze in small portions. FYI, dry commercial cat food is even worse for your cat than commercial canned. If you can't get your cats to switch to raw than at least get them off the dry."
4,"My kitties said ""NO"" stars.","I have a male and a female two year old inside cats. They absolutely love treats! I had debated about buying these flakes since they are a bit pricey and had them in my cart for several weeks. Finally, I decided to treat my kitties and ordered. They arrived quickly and come in a resealable plastic container and were full whole flakes. They smelled to high heavens but I expected that. I have tried for two weeks to entice my kitties to eat these and they totally refuse. One smelled them one time and left the room and refuses to come near if the container is around. The other will smell them and move them around with his nose but refuses to even lick them. They love the smelly fish cat food but not this. I like the container idea and that the product was full flakes and easy to get out of the container and rated it 4 starts for that. I will give them to a friend who has two cats and see if hers will eat it. Will update on her results."
2,Wrong Size Cat-Man-Doo Flakes Sent,"The one ounce size was advertised, but I received the .5 ounce size. There was a white sticker on the container with the words ""one ounce""typed on it, but the container had 1/2 ounce printed on it! If my cats didn't love this product so much, I would have given it one star. I will not not be ordering this product through Amazon again because of the incorrect size shipped to me. The seller was Gulf Coast Pet Supplies and the price was $7.13"
1,Good stuff but way too expensive!,"The product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it. However, Cat-Man-Doo or ""Bonito Flakes"" as the Japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on Amazon, there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here. You can also find this at your local Korean/Japanese grocer in big bags that last months."
5,Cat-Man-Doo very tasty!,"My aging cat loves this treat even better than Kat Kaviar. It is quite fishy smelling, which she loves."
5,Tasty Cat Treats,"I received Cat-Man-Doo as a gift several years ago. Scottie, my cat, absolutely adors them and will do anything for a little nibble. None of my friends that have cats have heard of it. None of the local pet stores carry it and I've even checked several surrounding communities. Now that Scottie has tried Cat-Man-Doo treats, he won't eat any others."
3,Kitty Bonito Flakes,"Bought these for my kitty for a little treat. Opened the container, approximately the size of a large jar of mayo, and got a major whiff of fish smell. Kitty was unimpressed. Offered some to my pup and she loved them! Large, light, transparent flakes of dried fish. It looks like giant flakes of fish food. Super stinky but my dog loves it."
3,"Made CRF kitty violently ill. IBD kitty likes them, though.","I bought these because they were recommended as a way to get finicky seniors and sick cats to eat. My sick cat had to be coaxed to eat them, and they made her vomit almost immediately. My other cat, who has IBD, likes them fine but doesn't love them, and they do not cause any ill effects in him. I split the difference and gave them three stars for what the cats think, and I added a star, because these aren't processed and full of questionable ingredients. I wouldn't feed them to a cat who has CRF (although they are all different, and what doesn't work for mine may work for yours), but I would recommend them over kibble treats (except Greenies - we loveFeline Greenies, Beef, 3 oz. Package)."
3,Whew!,"These smell like the smoked chubs from Lake Michigan that were sold for human consumption in my hometown in Wisconsin. Apparently, however, my Alabama cats have never enjoyed smoked fish and found these feathery treats questionable. All they will give them is a reluctant nibble. Go figure!"
5,A Nightly Snack,"This is the nightly snack for one of my cats. The other one isn't interested, but she is the pickiest of the two. The cat that gets this as a snack every night knows about what time I give it to her and she is waiting in the kitchen by the cabinet where I keep it. Usually I vary their snacks, but once my kitty tried this brand of fish flakes she hasn't been interested in any of the other snacks I offer her. Good stuff!"
3,"Some cats like it, others don't","I have four cats and one of them loves this stuff, one will nibble a bit and the otehr won't go near it. It stinks to high heaven so keep the lid on it."
3,Kitty treat,These were recommended by a friend in the US as she knew our cat was poorly and thought this would renew her interest in food. Sadly she died the very day they arrived. I have passed them on to my daughter for her cats who have yet to try them.The only negative comment I have is that there was an additional postal charge of 8+ made by Royal Mail which made this a really expensive item to purchase.
3,Enjoyable light fluff but the DVD has few extras.,"The dvd is from Rhino and is full screen/standard which is a shame since there are a few scenes which would have benefited from the widescreen format for example, Battle's drunken escapade in the park.There are no subtitles or closed captioning.There is a cast list with a brief biography and filmography forthe main actors. There is also a slide show with stills from the movie. There is no theatrical trailer.Not worth the money for just the movie and very little else."
4,my chaufferu,"nothing more than I saw. I was aware of the cost, the time for delivery. The delivery time was right on the money. I mean that it was in my mail box at the exact time I was told."
1,One of the worst ever,"Who's idea was it to combine the talents of the world's two worst actors, Sam Jones and Deborah Foreman? Foreman breaks off into silly accents and facial expressions at the drop of a dime, and Sam Jones was his usual non-emotive self. Terrible storyline, and somehow suckered Penn and Teller to take part. Not even worth a star. Absolutely no continuity whatsoever. Should get a minus rating."
5,Awesome movie! Can't find a better B movie anywhere!,"Everything about this movie--from the cheesy boy meets girls, boy and girl have incest plot to the amusing antics are forever in my heart. This movie will make you laugh, will make you question the 80s, but most of all, will make you feel good! Find it, you'll like it!"
5,Funny...,"I have looked for this movie for years. One of my all time favorites!!! The ""Catfight"" scene is one of the funniest things I've ever seen....still laugh every time I see it. Not too many people know about this one. Very much a ""cult"" like movie. If you find someone who has seen it...you'll have a scream!!! Highly recommended, you'll laugh until you cry!!"
5,Cult classic from the 80s,"I agree with the other lovers of this film. It's a guilty pleasure to watch this movie...my girlfriends and I, who were teenagers when we first watched it, had every line memorized. It is babe, isn't it? If anyone DOES find out how to get the soundtrack from this film let me know, I have also been searching since it came out."
2,OMG! Terrible!,This movie is terrible. The only reason that I gave 2 stars was because Deborah Foreman is cute as heck. I am so glad that I didn't pay to watch this!
3,Overall a pretty funny movie.,"The movie overall is OK.It has several scenes where the dialogue is WAY overdone I think. It also has quite a bit of obscene language and several graphic nudity segments. I would definitely NOT recommend this be viewed by children.However, aside from the above observations, it is worth watching. Deborah Foreman is hilarious at times and makes the whole film."
1,My Chauffeur,The acting was pathetic and the whole plot was unbelievable because of it. The main characters were crass and I just hated this movie.
4,Just as I remember it,"I loved this movie when I first watched it years ago. Now that it's a part of my personal library, my children enjoy it too. It's funny and romantic, although not as creative as the movies we have these days, still a movie I'm glad to own.One part of the movie I thought was quite boring, is the part with Penn & Teller. I mean, I really didn't see a point.Well, I hope this review helps in your purchase."
1,Ingredients list: Read it and weep.,"Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Figs Preserved With Sulfur Dioxide, Sugar, **Corn Syrup, **High Fructose Corn Syrup, Soybean Oil, **Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil, Salt, Cultured Dextrose And Potassium Sorbate Added To Preserve Freshness, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin (Emulsifier), Natural And Artificial Flavor.

Too bad! These could have been a great, tasty choice, but instead they turned out to be little nuggets of poison. Consider yourself warned."
5,FIG NEWTONS,"WHILE WATCHING TV, I LOVE A GOOD SNACK TO HELP PASS THE TIME. A GOOD LOW FAT FIG NEWTON WILL HIT THE SPOT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED FIG NEWTONS IN THE PAST AND STILL DO NOW. WITH A LW FAT VANILLA MILK, AM IN BUSINESS WITH A REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HANDS."
5,Nice Fresh Newtons,"If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a ""Newton"" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the ""best by"" date."
2,just don't like it,the jam inside feels cheap and don't like the taste. thought the rate on amazon was pretty good but feel disappointed.
2,These don't taste great.,"I love Fig Newtons and so does my 7 year old, so I thought I'd try the minis in a convenient size. Unfortunately they don't taste very good. There is hardly any fig inside and they're a bit dry. I'll opt for the regular size Newtons the next time I buy them."
5,Non-Fat Dessert,"While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying. The price and free shipping save us about 30% at Amazon compared to the Safeway market. Almost time for another case!"

5,"Best Book Ever,Must Read for VB.NET","This excellent Book explains everything you need to know about the framework and the CLR, especially for VB.NET. Richter covers a lot of the new features built in the language that will save you development time. He doesn't tackle most of the specialized classes in the .NET Framework like other books .but he does go in depth into the ones that will be used by most programmers .Many lights will go off in your mind as reading this book. Highly recommend this book to all VB.NET programmer."
2,A mastery of the material does not make a good book,"Mr. Richter has an incredible mastery of the elements of the .NET Framework. As others have observed, Microsoft development teams could indeed benefit from reading the book. (In fact, there are several instances in which Mr. Richter critiques the implementation that Microsoft has provided and offers his recommendation on how it could be improved.) Unfortunately, you would have to be a member of a Microsoft development team to have enough grounding in the concepts presented here to benefit from Mr. Richter's expertise. What it comes down to is there's a difference between presenting material and providing the tools that enable a learning experience to occur."
4,Great work: needs Summary info,"This is a great contribution to understanding the .Net framework. I would have liked for Jeff to have included a ""Best Practices"" or ""List of Recommendations"" based on his many findings. There's so much content to remember, that it will be hard to use it as a reference if his recommendation isn't in the section/chapter you think.The Summary Info could be a download or an appendix. Just a thought."
2,Tough Read,I am a technical person. I have developed using VB for nearly ten years now. This is the first .Net book I picked up. It was a mistake. I found that many of the topics covered in this book were easier to learn using other sources.
3,"Nice Ball Valve, made in USA, but not Full Port.","I missed what was not in the item description. When I received my Apollo Bronze 1 1/4"" ball valve I discovered it is not full port. ""Full Port"" means that the opening through the valve body is the same size as the inside of the copper pipe that will be soldered at each end. In the case of this valve, the opening through the chrome plated brass ball within the body of the valve is right at 1"" rather than the nominal inside dimention (1 1/4"") of 1 1/4"" type M copper pipe. The fluid carrying capacity of the 1"" throat of this valve is substantially less than that of a full port 1 1/4"" ball valve. In a hydronic application, this 1"" inside dimention imposes unnecessary flow restriction. It is also notable that many county and city building departments now require full port valves for shutoffs at the water heater supply and incoming fresh water. They do in El Paso County Colorado for sure."
3,An average offering from an above average band,"A promising start, but six minutes is far too long and the listener is easily bored. The presence of strings is nothing new for the Manics, and they sound all too familiar. A pleasant enough song, the type you sing along to on the radio but don't rush out to buy"
1,Naturalizer Women's Cheston Loafer,"I was sent the wrong size and Amazon refused to exchange them; said it was my fault. I know what size shoe I wear!!!! So, now I have shoes that I cannot wear. Amazon suggested that I sell them! That is ridiculous! Oh and I couldn't return them either because they were late in arriving to me and by the time I knew they were wrong, my 30 days were expired. Amazon could not be bothered."
3,"Same problem as previous reviewer, but opposite foot","Oh, how I wish these were evenly constructed and a little wider, because they are a nice shoe, and the price is reasonable. I had the same problem as the previous reviewer, except the right shoe is the one that was uneven. It looked a little ""wonky"" upon taking the pair out of the box; but, I thought it was the way they were packaged and/or my eyes playing tricks on me. However, I could tell *immediately* when trying them on that the right shoe was not ""right"".Also, I normally wear a medium-width shoe, and even though these are marked as such, they are a little narrow (even with thin, ""dress"" socks)."
1,"Wrong parts and missing parts. Also, no instructions!",Would not recommend any MOEN product. Craftmanship was horrible. Cheaply made. Parts were missing and wrong parts included in the box.
5,I am officially a Whedon-holic!,"I missed this show the first time round, but thanks to the recommendations of acquaintances and friends, I was able to rediscover this series on DVD. If you already have the individual season DVDs, then this collection will probably not add much, but for those of us who don't own them, this collection is a must-have.A smart, funny, witty, and highly enjoyable show, with characters that you grow to love and cheer for."
5,Great series set,"This is one of the sets that most people should have in their collection. This is a good way to acquire the whole series if you do not already own them. The other box set called the chosen one has been discontinued by Fox due to problems with the packaging. This series has better packaging, (nothing special, but if it is not broke don't fix it) and is easy to navigate with the breakdown. The series itself starts off lighthearted and begins a shift to more dramatic elements which follows the growth of the characters, extremely well done."
5,Hells yeah to the Hellmouth!,"The creative genius of Joss Whedon's ability to not only tell a great story, but his expert skill of developing a character-viewer relationship that takes you through every emotional journey (season by season) and live these character's lives as they grow and hone their skills in the elite force of beastie killers and vampire slayers. Each have a role in the well-oiled machine that is the Sunnydale and Global defense of all that goes bump in the night. Buffy The Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series is a must have for any Buffy or Joss Whedon fan."
3,buffy dvd series,"As a whole the buffy the vampire slayer series is awesome, however this specific product is terrible. Upon playing the freshly opened discs, one of the discs for season 4 was scratched and making most of the scenes in an episode unplayable. One of the discs for season 5 wont even load. I have not yet finished the series but so far i am extremely disappointed and will definitely be considering not making any more purchases from amazon."
1,Region 1 vs. Region 2 - Are We So Different????,"Apparently there is a disconnect between the Region 1 and the Region 2 marketing gurus - have they not figured out that the Region 1 audiences want special editions, too?Why buy Seasons 1-7 as a set if they are exactly the same thing as buying them individually? The ONLY reason to buy this set would be if you have never purchased a single season on DVD and want to take the leap and buy it all at once. And how many fans do not own at least one season on DVD? I would think a low percentage.(...)Last complaint....the Region 2 version apparently comes with ""a book containing a run through on all 144 episodes and a list of Joss' favourite episodes"" (according to a review on amazon.co.uk) - I want that!!!...can we buy this separately?Buffy is phenomenal and we in Region 1 just want the right to separated from our money just like our Region 2 peers. Thank you for reading."
5,Most impressed,"I would suggest this series to anyone of any age from 17 on up. Props to the writers and producers first and foremost, and they couldn't have selected a better cast in front of the camera. This series is a far strecth from the movie, so please if you think the movie is the model you'd be mistaken. This series is so well done in every catergory that it's more like reading a well written series of novels except you watch it instead of read it. Don't let the series title fool you, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is a fav of mine and if given the chance it will draw you in as well, guarnteed!!!!"
5,when the price dropped to $99 again i could not pass it up.,"Being a long time fan of the show and not having owned any of the single season dvd releases, this set was a nice buy for me.I will admit I was a bit nervous about the purchase after reading several unsatisfied reviews about smashed cases, smashes boxes, scratched dvdsso on and so forth...I am pleased to report that when it came in the mail the box was in mint condition, none of the discs were scratched and i am through the first season with zero problems.I am very pleased with my purchase.note: I generally only buy widescreen movies on account of the tv I have. This set not being wide screen doesn't bother me like some of the others who have reviewed poorly."
3,Great Show but video quality suffers.,"I'm a relatively late comer to the Buffyverse. I hadnt ever seen an episode until earlier this year when a friend of mine told me that I had to watch the show. After about 12 years of hearing how great it was I caved in and downloaded the first season and loved it so much I bought the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Collector's set.What drew me into the show were the characters, the amazing writing and the great pacing. Each episode entertained as much as is possible in 45 minutes. Watching these has made something very noticeable. The video quality is often lacking. There are often scenes where it seems like I am seeing double. The motion can get blurry and make things hard on the eyes. In a world where we were getting superb HD releases on blu-ray and even hd dvd at the time the video quality on this release is unacceptable. Until this series is digitally remastered (and hopefully in HD) then this is the way to go to enjoy one of the greatest shows ever made."
3,"Great show, but Amazon's pricing sucks!","I've watched this show from the first episode. I have gone to the conventions and met the actors. This is one of the best shows tv has ever seen. When I found out a collection like this would be coming out, I immediately sold off the seasons 1-7 I already owned to get some of my money back and not have doubles.Since it didn't come out intil November 15th, I wasn't in any hurry to pre-order from Amazon. But today I was about to do just that and then I see that the price has gone up $40!! WTF? That is ridiculous. Amazon really sucks sometimes."
5,Love the show,I love BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER!! I already own all 7 seasons but I might buy this set. I am very very addicted to buffy. I started watching this show long after it ended at a friends house. I watched becoming parts 1 and 2 and I instantly fell in love with the show and spike. The show is amazing. I constantly watch the show no matter what. Any one who loves buffy should buy this set. They would not be disapointed.
5,Great series,I never watched this series when it was on tv. Someone at work let me borrow the series. I loved it so much I bought the series myself. It was cute in the being and then got to be so serious and kept me at the edge of my seat near the end. This is definately worth it.
3,THE BOX ROCKS,"Frist let me tell you what two things about this set is why i gave it only 3 stars. one is because i thoght they would of made new CDs with new menus on them but no, and the next the set is a limited set but the sets are not numbered. But if you are a huge buffy fan like me you will still love this set! The bonus CD is cool too, Joss wort a varry nice letter."
3,"Buy Only If You Haven't Bought Them Already, Separately","Buy this collection of all 7 seasons only if you haven't already. The fact is, Buffy's previous seasons were all released earlier - and season seven just having been released, this set will be a waste for the hardcore fan. Only buy this if you are beginning."
2,"This Boxset Has a Plain, Generic, Boring Cover!","Buffy The Vampire Slayer is one of the most awesome TV shows I have ever seen, it is just a magnificent series but I have to agree with the complaints about this boxset not being as good as the hype lead us to believe it would be. I agree that if you haven't bought any seasons of this remarkable show yet that this is probably the best and cheapest way to get all seven seasons (if you can find one in good condition) but if you own all of the seven individual seasons on DVD then I would just say to keep them because this boxset is not only flimsly and the plastic holders can break easily but the boxset is also ugly. The individual DVD sets have nice covers with beautiful photos of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy usually with some of the supporting actors/characters standing in the back-ground on either side of her but the cover-art on the box for this 40 disc collection is ugly, boring, plain and generic."
5,Best Show Ever,"If I had one DVD set to take with me on a desert island, this would be it.Drama, horror, fantasy, humour, sex and violence all in one series. This was the best show ever on TV. I am glad I can watch my set any time I feel like it. The best Christmas present to myself I could wish for.Loved the show- hated to see it end."
1,buffy complete box set,All very wonderful up until season 5 where the last 2 disks will not play and have obvious printing defects.
5,Very Good!,"The videos of the TV shows are very good. The presentation, packaging is really excellent! I loved the way it comes in the box like a shelf. It opens up easily and is easy to select a set of shows to watch. My daughter loves it!Jayne"
3,Are you a Whedon fan?,Buffy is the bomb. Will be a forever fan. This is just a repackaging of the original series released DVD's. So the first couple of seasons still have that old annoying no 'play all' capability. But they are all here! And the box is classic Buffy style. Makes a nice display.
5,Love. This. Show.,"Five stars for the show. Even if you've never heard of it, I recommend buying the whole series.The packaging is OK--could have been better, but it serves its purpose. Mine was delivered in excellent condition.I only had one disc stop playing at one point, but I think it is because my dvd player is so old.Highly, highly recommend this product."
5,Buffy is a hit!,"The Buffy watchers in the house have not stopped viewing the series since it arrived. I'm not a fan, but they are - and love it. No complaints, which is always good. Better quality than most packaged sets ... that's what I've been told."
5,A Great Set,"I won't go into a review of the show, as other people have done that better than I could. What I will comment on is the convenience of owning the whole set in one contained package. Each season is 6 discs (with the exception of Seaon 1) in a standard DVD-sized case. The cases are clear, so on the inside of the DVD labels are the lists of episodes by disc, original airdate, and one-two sentence description. That surprised me since the original DVDs included a booklet that had all the episode information, so to condense that info into two sides of a DVD label seems like a considerable feat.Anyway, if you're on the fence about this product, I would recommend buying it for a)the brilliance of the series, and b)the convenience of owning the whole set."
2,Where's the WIDESCREEN????????,Great set other than the widescreen seasons are presented full screen. That is a crock. Why should the limeys get widescreen and we Americans who made the show what it was and is get snubbed? Buy it from the ebay scabs for 800.00+ or wait for another release. I'm waiting.
3,Buffy the Vampire Slayer Packaging Issue,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)We bought this Collector's Set in October for someone else as a Christmas gift. It hasn't been opened yet, so I can't comment on the contents. However, when this item first arrived, there was an odd indentation on the end of the package that appeared to be water damage. There was no one to talk to about it, but Amazon's return procedures are very simple, so we returned it for replacement. When the replacement turned out to have the exact same apparent damage, we figured that it must be inherent in the packaging. We won't know until after the holidays whether all is okay, but we expect that it will be."
1,NOTHING TO SEE HERE !,This show was miserable from the start. Its no wonder it was canceled on 2 occasions. How it lasted as long as it did is a miracle. How something so bad survived is beyond logic. THe acting is putrid and the scripts are just awful. Dont waste your time here
1,PATHETIC!,The facts about this show are not in dispute. It was canceled twice. Dont like it go and blame the networks that canceled it. Terrible acting. Dont like it go blame the actors who were terrible. Terrible scripts. Dont like it go blame the Moronic writers. It cracks me up seeing so few defend this show. There comments and reviews are comic genious. YOu just dont get it do you? :)
5,"If You're a fan of Buffy, it's a must buy!","ok, this is by far one of the best tv show series sets out there.i bought this only after watching the first season online and this show is outstanding! def. buy from amazon; they did a great job of getting it here to me fast. so, yea, def. order it!"
5,Yeah!!!,My two younger daughters are more than thrilled with this whole collection. We were very late to the game of discovering the show.
5,I Must Have This!,"Love Love Love Buffy!! I need to own the entire series! Thank goodness for Netflix as a temporary fix. This series makes me laugh, cry, and get jealous because I always wanted to be Buffy...as childish as that sounds. I love the character development, the change in story through the years (although I have to admit that the college years weren't my favorite...and I really didnt care for Dawn). I miss this series. They better NOT remake it or even try to do a movie version. I would be so mad if they did. There needs to be a facebook page that calls to leave Buffy alone!"
3,About the Packaging,"Thankfully I work at a DVD store, so I will probably be able to find some abandoned cases that I can replace these with. Inside the nice box are the slim sets that you can get a target or walmart, only the ones you get from Amazon are likely to have the same problem as mine - they will be dented and chipped, and the inside insert that holds the center discs will probably be only partially attached or snapped off completely. I won't complain too vehemently, because as I've seen other reviewers mention, you can't beat the price, but in retrospect, I should have waited for the other collection to go on sale. It comes with the same packaging as the Angel Complete Series, and overall I think the other packaging is better. If I come across it, I wouldn't hesitate to sell off this set and reinvest in the nicer packaging of the Complete Series."
5,Suprisingly great,"I never watched Buffy when it was on TV, but when it came out on DVD, my friend bought the first season and let me borrow it. Then I rented a few more seasons, and I realized just how good the show actually is. Joss Whedon is absolutely brilliant. This show has humor, drama, action, and horror all rolled up into one. The box set has everything in it, including an extra special features disc, and a booklet covering every episode. It gets 5 stars from me!"
3,Check Box Set When Received,"I Ordered this Box set and was so excited. When I received it, in great timing by the way, I automatically started watching it. It wasn't until I got to Season Four that I realized there was actually double of Season Four and Not Season five. I should have checked it when I first got it but since it was sealed wrapped I trusted everything was in perfect condition. I was so upset and called Amazon & they actually sent me another set free of charge. I'm only leaving this review just incase this happens to anyone else, so ensure you check your stuff right away because I doubt I'm the first person this has happened to. The Series is great though, I'm still anxiously awaiting my new set so I can continue on with Season Five."
2,Broken,Disk 5 season 5 came all destroyed and can't be read by most players and if the player can read it it comes out all glitchy. Other disks couldn't be read unless I restarted the whole player.
5,The best TV series of all time!!! 9/10,"This is my favorite TV series of all time but I give it 9/10 because every TV series always has weak shows here and there. If you liked the TV show ""Angel"" but never saw ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", then you'll fall in love with this show! Buffy has some great friends that really helps making this an awesome show. I hope they make this a movie one day!!! The show can become a chick flick at times but just about every episode has at least a few fight scenes so you'll see a lot of action."
4,Buffy DVD's,"All went well with my order and was pleased with the delivery and all. I love the look of the package and the individual year boxes. I'm glad I waited until the series was over and the whole series was available in one package. The only bad thing about it is that it's a bit dark when viewing on the TV. I have to adjust the brightness when viewing it. I thought it would come in a lot better, in fact perfectly. Oh well, it's the content that I love anyhow."
5,Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set,"Shipping was timely (Thanks for the free shipping!). Product was safely packaged. The DVD set was everything that I expected; thanks to the preview photos I saw I new exactly what I was getting. And the price was great, too."
5,Not cancelled,"Two reviewers said this show was cancelled by two different networks. Untrue. It was the highest rated show on the WB at the time, the producers and cast wanted more money, the WB refused and were outbid by UPN. Two years later, SMG and Joss Whedon ""mutually decided"" to end the series. Never cancelled.Angel was another story."
5,Great Gift,This was ordered as a Xmas gift and I couldn't have been any more pleased. It arrived in perfect condition and much sooner than I expected. My friend was thrilled with the special features on most of the discs (She still has not been through the entire collection) and will spend hours on this 40 disc set. She tells me that she can't wait to finish the set so she can start again and that it is the best Xmas gift she has ever received. Well worth the money.
4,"Great Show, Bad Luck w DVDs","I already knew I loved this show so I knew I would love the content of the product. However this is the fourth time I've gotten a dvd from Amazon that has a damaged disc (computer skips over damaged section and tells me so). I'm returning it to get a replacement copy, and Amazon has always been really good with handling these situations, but four times is getting annoying. In general always watch the dvds as soon as possible, especially large box sets because you will have a short time period for returns (I lucked out since I bought it during the holiday time period so I got 2 months)."
4,"Great, but a little scratched up","I am one of the biggest buffy fans of all time and got this for christmas last year and when I got it 1-3 episodes decided to skip and I never did anything to make it that way. Other than the few skipping, I LOVE it."
1,Be warned - Amazon DOES NOT SELL THE BOX SET SHOWN,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series when it was on the air. I was saddened to later discover that, for technical reasons, there will (likely) never be a Blu-Ray remastering of Buffy TVS. I thus took the plunge on this, the ""Chosen Collection"" DVD box set.Amazon's stocking of this item was delayed by a couple of weeks, then finally shipped. I discovered that instead of the limited edition ""Chosen Collection,"" I received the following:[search ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer-Complete Series"" at Buy-dot-com]This is nothing more than a repackaging of the ""slim"" editions of each of the seasons. There's no bonus disc, no letter from Joss Whedon, no inner box artwork. It is a cheaper set, both in terms of content, and the competition's (versus Amazon's) price - about $60 cheaper.Hopefully Amazon corrects this item on their site. (I have sent an e-mail to customer service to that effect.) Until then, buyer beware!"
2,"Buffy is amazing, DVD quality is amazingly bad!",I have not made it through the 2nd season of Buffy yet and have already encountered three episodes that won't play (they get about 90% through the episode and then it crashes and jumps back to the DVD's main menu). All of season two is having issues with layering so it sounds like an electronic hiccup or something every few minutes. Very distracting!I love this series and I feel taken advantage of that Amazon would sell such a shoddy product.BUYER BEWARE!!!
5,Addicted to Buffy,"This product is amazing! It's a must-have for any Buffy fan. Not only does it have the complete series, but even special features for each episode! Definitely a good way to get your Buffy fix if you are addicted like I am!"
1,Misleading Package,I was very sad when I received this and it was in a totally different package then the one pictured.
4,One of the Best shows ever written....BUT!,"This is seriously one of the greatest TV shows ever written. It is highly enjoyable though several viewings by yourself, with friends, making a game.The dialogue is great.The first season is a little slow, but come season 2 things start to pick up.My personal favorite is season 3.My only problem with the DVDs is that there is no Play All function for each disc and you have to go through a few menu screens to get to the next episode.Hopefully they will change this for a 10th anniversary release or something.I would rather just click play and have all 3-4 episodes on the disc play through,I'm not sure why they did not do this."
5,What a great Box Set!!!!!,I bought this form eBay this summer for 215$ when Amazon was out. I love this set becusae it awesome and it has everythign in it. The seasons and special features are awesome!! I just am mad that i could have gotten it for nearly $50 less!
3,"No Bonus Disc, I'll keep my 7 single season sets then!",I paid close to 30.00 each for the 7 seasons as they came out and was thinking of buying this complete set then selling my older ones to gain the bonus disc but now I see that it is no longer included! I don't know if my single season sets are packaged better or play better but they are paid for and I am no longer interested in this set despite the cheap price this week!
5,This Boxed Set VS. the individual Seasons 1-7 Boxed Sets,"Can anyone tell me if this FULL DVD Boxed set contains anything new or different from the individual boxed Seasons 1-7?I already have all the seasons dvd's 1-7, so I'd like to know before I spend the money on a duplicate DVD.Thanks!"
5,Best show ever,for all of you people that said you wasted time watching this show you are intitled to you opinion ( it may be wrong) (actually you are wrong) and and another thing is the peolpe who are whining please stop it is really annoying really it is ok the show I think looks better in full screen well for the people out there that are looking to buy this listen to me you won't be disappointed it is an awsome show
1,Lousy packaging,"I would not suggest u guys to buy this now. It's not that the series is bad. It's the packaging. I bought this this week but the edges of the box set are all damaged because they changed the way of packaging. And now I will be out of the town for business, I have no time to return this set."
1,Disappointed with naming mistake by Amazon,"At the time of purchase, which I have to admit was for a great price, I was informed by Amazon's website that I was buying ""The Chosen Collection"" as per my order details page. Today I received the shipment, which is suppose to be a Christmas gift for my girlfriend who is a huge Buffy fan, and I unpack ""The Complete Series""I see a number of other people are in the same situation I am in now. I cannot complain about the price, but I ordered this under the false assumption it was the product advertised and now I don't think I'll be able to return it per their rules, as this is not what I ordered. That, I can justifiably complain about.Not sure what I am going to do, have yet to contact Amazon about it."
5,Classic Collection,"I've owned each season of Buffy since first release, and at this price I'm tempted to buy it again just to have a library set whilst lending out the other to friends and family. I can't imagine too many people are coming to this series new, but I envy those who are. The entire series is well worth 5 stars, but I've always thought the first season to be weaker than the rest, and there is little to be lost in starting with season two and then backfilling with the dozen season one episodes at a later date."
1,Ignore the customer images and reviews. They're inaccurate.,"After many people were mislead and complained, Amazon updated the title and initial description to indicate that the bonus 40th disc isn't included. However, they didn't feel so inclined to remove the (mostly positive) reviews that reviewed a very different product, nor did they remove the many customer images of the bonus material that's NOT included. Besides the extra disc with the better special features, it also doesn't include any of the other material (book, letter, etc) that are shown.1 star because Amazon has a lot of work to correct with this listing, in order to be HONEST with its customers about what they're selling."
2,I love Buffy but...,I can't except season 4-7 with no widescreen. So I won't buy it. I'll just stick to watching Buffy on Netflix.
2,Redundant Box Set,"I feel that this boxset is more for casual Buffy fans who are on the fence about purchasing box sets. As an owner of a region-free DVD player and all 7 seasons (4-7 in widescreen), I wouldn't trade my widescreen versions for full-screen ones, even if they were originally shot that way. I agree with the reviewer who said that widescreen versions would be nice and also a little digital remastering as the first 2 seasons could stand to be cleaned up a little. I do feel that this is a very reasonable price if you don't have any of the seasons or just want a cool-looking box to sit on your shelf, but if you already have the seasons, I can't see investing money just to have a fancy boxset and an extra bonus disc."
2,Disappointed :(,I ordered this product from Amazon and 3 WEEKS LATER I had to order it from someone else because it never showed up. I have always used Amazon but this left me completely disappointed.
1,bummed,"I haven't gotten all the way through the discs, but at least a few of them don't play at all!! I have tried on multiple DVD players.. SUCKS!"
3,Problem packaging,"The show is great, of course. This particular package left several things to be desired, though. The transfer is quite grainy, especially noticeable in the many nighttime/darkness scenes. The discs seem more prone to skipping than an average DVD, even after minimal handling. Within the box, each season's discs are contained within a separate booklet, but they're stacked vertically, which makes it a nuisance to get the later seasons (toward the bottom of the stack) in or out of the box. The bonus disc of retrospectives was fun, though."
4,Buffy collector's set,"My first boxed set of Buffy was stolen by thieves who burgled my house. Alas DVDs were not all they took.I liked the original boxed set of BTVS better because of the packaging. The box in which this set of DVDs came is less convenient and does not store as well in my DVD cabinet. It is definitely less easy to access.The series is, of course, terrific.The shipping was timely."
4,Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Collectors Set,I checked all the discs and they are in new condition; the price is fantastic. Only complaint: they didn't send an email with the order tracking information. I had to track them down; the product came within the time period but it still would have nice to the tracking information. They did respond to my emails. Next time I won't order so close to a time when I would be going out of town.
2,"Wonderful series, Horrible Idea to re-release like this...","Let me just start by saying that I don't own ""The Chosen Collection"" but that I do own the original releases of all seven seasons.Why review this then?Quite frankly, I believe the combined sets to be a waste of money. I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers, and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is, and just as breakable.The set's discs appear the same as the previous editions, probably a rehash from leftover sets. A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor, but since I don't own it, I haver never seen it.I spent my money on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" once, and once is enough for me. Buffy is a endearing series, but why throw away DVD sets just to have them ""return"" from the garbage?"
3,My order was switched without notice also,"I sent the 40-disc set as a 40th birthday gift a month ago. I was happy to pay the almost two hundred dollars. My best bud was getting 40 little presents (i.e. the discs) to celebrate the big 4-0.I saw the price drop yesterday but was OK since it was for a repackaged deal. I wanted her to have the fancy one. Well, imagine my surprise when I found that she only got the 39 disc set and Amazon didn't change what they charge me (bad business policy)Well, a phone call to Amazon and they are refunding me the difference. So if this happened to you, call and get the refund. 5 minute call.As far as product, my friend is happy to have all the episodes on DVD and is enjoying reliving one of her favorite shows so it's all good. Plus she gets to pretend it was a 39th birthday celebration (LOL)"
4,Good set with a few minor quirks,"I like this set. I would still have bought it if I had known about the quirks that it has.The two things I wish were different about this set are: 1. I wish the menus on the discs were more straight-forward. Some menus are in a circle which seems to confuse my DVD player at times. Also, on at least the first season, the titles of the episodes are configured into a square instead of a list, so you have to consult the dvd case to figure out the order the episodes are in.2. There is no ""Play All"" option on the disc. You have to go episode to episode. Each time an episode ends, you are brought back to the episode menu and you have to return to the main menu to select the next episode.Both issues are minor and only slight inconveniences, not really anything that makes this set unworthy of purchase. I have enjoyed owning this set and would buy this as a gift."
5,Great for the Buffy enthusiast,For anyone that loves Buffy this is a great gift at a fantastic price. I bought this for my husbands best friend and it was a big hit all around.
2,Discs are damaged,"I purchased the 8 season boxed set. When I got to Season 5, I found the first two discs, with 8 episodes in all, were damaged and would not play. I have not yet tried the other discs in that season but missing 8 episodes so far destroys the continuity. The return time expired and I have no recourse. The quality control from this company is horrendous and as a result, I will not make any more purchases."
5,Excellent,"It was very nice to hear the different generations of NCM's on this CD. The bonus tracks are fantastic! Great job, Tom!"
1,"The horror, the horror!","This CD is a fine example of soulless marketing, bleeding hunks variety.For those of you who like opera, get a real opera. Good performances of ""La boheme"" are easy to find. For those of you who like a particular singer or conductor, seek out that person's work. For those of you who want an introduction to opera or to top-flight singing, go elsewhere, there's plenty of good stuff to be found.For those of you who want a genuine freak show, step right up, this is for you. Nowhere else are you likely to find both Andrea Bocelli and Herbert von Karajan on the same disk!"
3,"Good, but not all it seems","This is a collection of excerpts from performances actually spread over a number of years. The sound quality is variable as a result, though generally it is quite good. There is some great singing. However, be warned: although the cover lists performers, the list does not match the reality."
4,Useful and well-constructed reference text,"Useful, but if you are serious about learning Japanese buy the ""furigana"" versions. The introduction and grammar notes are also very good. I use the ""furigana"" version often (from what I can see it has exactly the same content as the romanji versions)."
4,Great book,"Goes through the entire life story of Aileen Wuornos, notorious female serial killer up to her execution. Very informative, good read."
1,Very bad book,"This book is so badly written that I almost can not read it. The language is bad, the narrative jumps here and there without any discernable intention. There are too many details, and the story is so jumbled that it is almost impossible to follow. I do not recommend this book. See the film ""Monster"" instead."
3,I was very disappointed,"While I admire the exhaustive research that Sue Russell put into this book, I found that the book had a very judgemental, exploitave, and sensational ring to it. I would have preferred a more ""unbiased"" review of this woman's live. Some writers are simply more adept at this then others; they present both sides of the story (without judgement) and let the reader decide for themselves. I don't feel that she did this."
3,"Good, but somewhat biased","I have been interested in Aileen Wuornos's story for a while and I was somewhat dissapointed with this book. For one thing it is debatable whether Wuornos could even be classified as a serial killer, she did not stalk her victims as most serial killers do and many of her crimes were an act of revenge and self-defense from ""johns"" who were attacking her. Prostitutes are repeatedly abused and raped by their ""customers"" and what's worse is that no one tends to believe their story if they report. Richard Mallory one of her victims was even convicted of prior sexual abuse and rape and the police did nothing to check this out during the investigation. Additionally, women who kill are punished at a much more severe rate than men who commit the same crime and I think the author only focused on the sensationalism of this case instead of showing the entire picture. Otherwise, the book was easy to read and very informative."
3,Female Serial Killer - True Story,"Interesting account of one of America's most notorious female serial killers - Aileen Carol Wuornos - in a case that forever changed the way the courts and police view these terrible crimes which had previously been thought to be the sole domain of men.In 1990, she went on a murder spree, killing seven men, who had all been shot and robbed. Together with her lesbian lover, this hooker with a troubled life and a long rap sheet, went on a cold-blooded rampage, luring customers into a death-trap."
4,Good book...but there was alot more to Aileen that wasn't negative...,Aileen Wournos fascinates me...I love to read true stories..and unusual memoirs about the sex industry...so..I dorecommend this book..although there was alot more to Aileenthan this negative depiction of her. Ivy League Stripper..and the new book Dance to Despair (memoirs of an ExoticDancer) by Rebeckka Sathen Black...based on a spellbindingtrue story of a women who danced in the Chicagoland areastrip clubs for a majority of her youth...
3,Blood of Heroes,"This is by no means a great film, but by the same token it is not a bad film either. You must be patient with it like ""Rollerball"" or ""Robot Jox"" to fully appreciate it's message and acting. It starts slow with the typical SciFi Apocalpyse that has made a wasteland out of what was once fertile. A small group of ""ruggers"" is travelling from dogtown to dogtown playing matches to get by. Now at first it is almost so depressing you may want to turn it off, but give it a chance. If you can hang with it past the first half hour you will see the movie truly is worth watching and the story and acting is pretty good. I must admit if not for the cast with Hauer, Lindo, D'Onofrio, and Chen I probably would have been less forgiving. But their acting keeps you interested. In fact the whole movie is understated and that's probably one of the impressive things about it. Decent quality DVD with ocassional replayability."
4,"Stars now, but then...",See how many of today's TV & Cinema stars you recognize in this futuristic take on post-nuclear holocost football. The plot is simple to grasp and the action seems anesthesized by todays standards but a good story and the action and costuming is great.
1,"Cut down version, but the only game in town.","I loved this movie. I went out of my way to get a copy of a film whose popularity led to its release after a 13-year lapse between the film and the issue of the DVD. Needless to say, 14 lost minutes add up to a lot on a disk with only 91 minutes. I will continue to watch this version only because it is better than not having one to watch, but will do whatever is necessary to get the full version. Take 15% out of the Godfather and see what happens. Still a good film, but no middle and no end. A sad, very sad treatment of a terrific film."
3,Post-Apocalyptic Gold!,"Definitely the best '80s post-apoc film outside of the Mad Max trilogy, for all the reasons others here have noted. I'd give it five stars for the actual movie. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD: no widescreen, a very dark transfer in all the non-sunlight scenes, and a terrible, terrible audio transfer that necessitated turning the television volume all the way up just to hear all that cool jugger dialogue."
4,Intense,"Quite a movie! I saw this film late at night on HBO. Like most Late-Night movies, this one exceeded my expectations with a plot and storyline that amazed me. The overtones and symbolism in this movie are intense. A must see for anyone who enjoyed ""Rollerball""."
4,Not What You Think,Despite the Cheese of this Rutger Hauer movie there is a brain behind the violence. This film written and directed by David Peoples is a metaphor explaining the difcult road he traveled while breaking into Hollywood. This film is a must for all aspiring writers and directers and even actors. It really is that hard to get in.
1,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD","I saw this movie in the theater long ago, and could hardly wait for it to come out on DVD. But when it did... Ouch.Three HUGE problems with the DVD: 1) The color/brightness are terrible, some scenes so dark that they're almost impossible to see -- you have to crank up your TV's brightness to get a clue. 2) The sound is totally muddy -- several lines we had to replay to decipher at all. And 3) why is there no widescreen option?All of these problems could have been avoided. In theaters, the movie was widescreen, well-lit, and sounded good.Lions Gate has taken a great post-apocalypse action movie and released a DVD that's best used as a coaster for your drink. I love the movie, but DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."
3,Poor version of a great movie,"As commented on before this is a very poor quality copy of a great movie, it appears as though someone made the dvd off an old worn out VHS copy that was used as a door stop for 10yrs. The picture is very grainy and washed out and the sound is about 1/2 the volume of other movies. As a matter of fact i have a very old VHS copy of this movie i copied from hbo about 15yrs ago and it still looks better than this one. Thanks to Amazon as always for even having the movie available."
3,Too bad its the american version,"I was very disappointed to find out that this was the American version, it lacks 10 minutes of footage, and has sort of a happy ending for Sallow.Apart from that this is still a very solid post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie."
4,Love the movie but dissappointed with presentation,"This is one of my favorite movies. Not sure why. Honestly.First off this movie is essentially a sports movie wrapped into a post-apocalyptic setting.This movie is full of character actors we all know as well. Rutger is his usual awesome self in this well written, well acted, low-budged faire. The script and pacing is tight and the final playing of ""The Game"" plays better than many other sport movies.Now for my main complaint. This movie is in 4:3! No widescreen presentation? This movie has played on Bravo plenty of times in Widescreen. It had a theatrical release this was no direct to video movie.On the off-chance this movie is ever remastered and released in its original aspect ratio I will be the first to buy it!"
2,Horrible DVD quality ruins a fun movie,"As others have observed, this DVD is extremely poor quality. night and indoor scenes are often so dark as to make the characters almost impossible to recognize, and the sound was so poor that I turned by TV volumne up above 60 and had to shut down a computer in the room because the cooling fan from the computer was louder than the dialogue from the DVD.Sad because this is a fun movie with Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen playing an interesting and brutal sport. The rules are never explained, nor is there any explanation why a person who enters the field of play armed with a pugil stick is called a ""slash"", but the movie is good for an afternoon of relaxation.I don't recommend purchasing this to anyone who isn't prepared for the poor quality of the picture and sound. Someone needs to redo the DVD with a high quality master."
2,Product good...service poor,"When I did a direct e-mail about the order not arriving, them wanted a group more info and couldn't tell the order date. It arrived after 1 1/2 months...speedy!"
3,"Great movie, only fair video/sound quality","Where's the widescreen version of this movie?! Apparently nobody bothered to produce one, let alone a blue ray version. It's a damn shame because this is a Great movie. The quality is fair at best but I still recommend it."
3,3 in 1 Convertible Car Seat -- Rugby,"This item sounded like a winner since I have grandchildren ranging in age from 2 months to 5 years. Yesterday my 2-year-old granddaughter used it for the first time. She complained that the piece between her legs was uncomfortable as she was wearing a dress so it pressed into her bare skin. On the return ride from church she cried so much I had to leave that part undone, certainly not very safe, but it saved our nerves. I don't know if I will ever again be able to use it, even if she is wearing pants since she now hates it. She is not overweight -- the piece just is located right between her legs rather than on her abdomen."
3,"Good Quality, But if Buying for Infant and Up Consider This","The delivery of the seat itself was very timely. I did have some difficulty figuring out how to best install it in the car, but finally i just had someone with more patience play around with it until it was really secure. I bought this seat because of the fact that it was one that my son could grow with...(he was starting to outgrow the infant carrier one) so i bought this one thinking it would be the last one i'd have to buy...or at least for a good while. Anyway, all was well until i realized that because it doesn't detach i can no longer take him into stores...he can't yet sit up by himself and that was something i didn't even think about! Also, there's no sun shade and so the sun gets in their eyes. Aesthetically speaking the seat looks great, but if you're buying for a child who can't yet sit up by themselves you might want to think twice."
1,don't like it at all,"i bought this and i had to return it two weeks later. I first thought this should be good is small and it look convenient but for one, my son when he falls assleep his poor head is dangling and he look soooo uncomfortable i'm like theres gotta be something outthere better to support his head when he sleeps."
3,my carseat,i bought this car seat for my daughter and it is a very nice car seat and lots of room for my daughter who is 10 months old i like everything abou this carseat except the there are two tiny hole underneath the cover and my daughter got her fingers caught in these holes and left a mark on her finger i'm gonna be contacting the compant on this for this a dangerous thing for a child
3,so-so carseat,this caresat is a pain in the backside to install rear facing with the LATCH system. The directions are confusing as to how to rethread the LATCH. There are much easier carseats on the market to install than this one.
3,Marc,"Too complicated and pricy. I should have purchased a simple car seat for baby's age and then a booster seat later. Would have been simpler and cheaper. Also, you don't have to pay alot to feel protected."
5,Perfect,I went to babies r us for this carseat and was pleased to find it I have a newborn son and he sits in it fine the headrest is a bit small but it still works its easy to install and switch between cars (Which I do alot) I took it on a trip and it worked very well on the plane I love this carseat.
1,Dictionary,This is just the right product for my ESL students. The words are simple and easy to understand.They can right simple sentences using this dictionary.
3,"Very Good Movie, So and so DVD","The Movie is very good, even though sometimes you may feel stuffed for the last 40 minutes with endless flow of heavy music (Destiny). Still it does a great job as a touching human tale. (The acting is simply superb) The reason I cannot give this product more stars is the subtitle. This DVD comes with two subtitles (Chinese and English), which are usually OK, but in some part, there is no subtitle in any language for 3 or 4 lines. It happens two or three times throughout the movie. (So, it is not too bad and no problem in catching up with the story) Other than that, no complain for the transfer, and very recommendable movie. So, if you have no other way to see this movie, this is the best option and I recommend it. But, sincerely hope somebody make a better version of DVD of these excellent Nomura classics as they did for Zero Focus & Demon."
4,A tribute to my cousin's unit in WWII- he was KIA.,"The book relives the air battles fought with B-17 Bombers in World War II. My cousin went down March 29, 1944 in one of the 91st planes. Marion Havelaar details the complexities and frustrations of air warfare over Germany and Europe; his insightful look at the staggering losses of Allied crews is a tribute to the brave warriors of Bassinbourne, England. A job well done."
5,Cute date night movie,Wife thought it was very cute and husband even enjoyed it. Cute date night movie with a little romance and action all in one.
2,"Seriously, Who Made This Thing?","The story isn't horrible, it isn't really inventive either, there isn't anything you don't see coming from a mile away. Hardy and Pine fighting over Reese Witherspoon is probably appealing to a lot of ladies so I'm sure boyfriends and husbands everywhere will be sitting through this lack luster attempt at film making.If you really want to have fun though, drink every time there's a continuity error, a poorly used green screen shot, a scene where the actors weren't in the room together or just cheap hurry up film making, oh, the sun is pure white light, at dusk? Okay then...This Means War insults the audience by thinking we will never pick up on how the whole thing is held together with a lick and dream, I'm sure everyone was happy to get their paychecks and leave this piece of junk behind on their IMDB.Save your time and watch something else."
4,This IS War,"Though not well received by the critics, I thought this movie was hilarious. Okay, it's a chick flick. There was enough action and, bromance tension in the film to keep the guys interested. Movies are meant to entertain, not every thing has to be factual or in line with 'that could never happen'. I love the paint ball scene. Recommend to any one who needs a laugh. McG does it again."
2,Boring and predictable,"Found this movie painfully predictable and slow. It was a cute idea and I looked forward to a light, yet entertaining romantic comedy. But, it lacked the spark that is so likeable in most of Reese Witherspoon's movies. There was no depth to the ""bad guy"" scenario, so that part seemed pointless. I disliked the FDR character and he never grew on me even though it was obvious how his character would play out. Tuck was more interesting, but even his character became boring. Katie's character was basically non-existent and her role in the movie seemed carelessly thrown in for a poor wrap up. I also hated the way both guys acted and really didn't want Lauren to choose either one, but of course she did. Ugh. I would have given it 1 star, but I laughed at a few scenes and that's what made it bearable."
2,"A Little Entertaining, Horrible Evil-Mastermind Development","This movie was almost what you would expect from the previews, except the editing is worse (McG, seriously? I'm surprised you still have a career with the flaming pieces of poo flicks you've dared throw at the silver screen. That, and the ultra-douchey name), and there was this bizarre evil mastermind development that was born early in the flick, to be revisited once in the middle, then 'fixed' as the climax of the film. And by climax, I mean the last five minutes of this face-punching suckfest. I am just now remembering how bad it ended while I write this. *Blech*"
2,More crass than I expected.....,"I was hoping for a lighthearted romantic comedy with some cool action thrown in (Knight and Day-ish for example). However, I found parts of the movie to be rather offensive. The scene with Trish and Bob making out on the floor was disgusting, to be honest. Most of the conversations had between Trish and Lauren were sordid and did not appeal to my sense of humor.That said, there were parts of the movie that were hilarious.Overall, it was decent but not worth buying/rewatching."
1,Not Funny,All of the funny parts of this movie are in the commercial. Didn't like it at all. Inappropriate material to watch with your kids.
3,"Lightweight, and looks like a TV episode","Don't know how McG produced this. It looks mostly like a TV show in production values. I suspect much of the background were CGI. Cameras, lighting, makeup etc. look like high grade consumer stuff. Wielded by pros no doubt. Still I wonder why it was done this way.The main characters are good actors and do pretty well within limits of the story. Too cheesy, a bit contrived, but not bad for light mindless entertainment. Almost should give it a two, actors are worth a 4 so I give it a 3 star revue.Not bad, not good. Much less action than promised, less sex too. Mostly teases with both and provides very little. What it provides is pretty good, but it is only a miniscule part of the movie. If you got nothing better to do is better than nothing for 97 minutes."
3,As expected,"Only gave it 3 stars cause it was predictable. Good comedy, good romance, but the first time I watched it, it felt like an old movie I hadn't seen in a while."
1,stupid,"this movie was stupid, i could hardly make it through the whole thing. I am surprised by all of the comments about what good of a movie it was. Waste of four dollars."
2,love tom hardy...not so much the movie.,"let me first start by saying tom hardy is probably one of the best imports out of britian in years. his work in 'bronson,' 'warrior,' and of course 'the dark knight rises' is stellar. so now we come to 'this means' war.' well, i'm still a hardy fan, but the movie was difficult to watch. why two stars instead of one? well, the action sequences were fun, and with the amount of money they put into the film, one would be hard pressed to give it one star. the plot sucks, but it's tom hardy. it's difficult to hate him, unless he makes another one like this."
4,Good Video!,"Funny story, cute plot. DVD arrived in good condition. No issues with viewing the DVD. We liked the multiple endings."
4,Good movie,My husband and I enjoyed watching this flick. An improvement over the usual chick movie that Witherspoon is known to star in. Enough action to keep the husband interested.
3,"Like the movie, download was terrible","This movie was fun, just simple fun,However, the download was terrible.This was the first time I ever rented a movie.The words were not in sync with the visual. S I had to keep stopping it every 5 minutes to catch up. If I had not done this, the movie visuals would have gotten about 30 minutes ahead of the audio! So that made the movie very frustrating to watch, Was this a fault of my laptop? Of Amazon? Of my iTunes library ? Any answers?"
3,"ok, light-hearted movie","Not great, but worth watching to the end. A familiar story line that's made watchable by reese witherspoon. A harmless /mindless diversion for the end of a long week."
4,Great Movie!!,Both myself and my wife found this movie to be both extremely entertaining and very very funny. I would highly recommend this movie to any adult.
3,This means war,It was a pretty good movie. Just did not end the way I thought it should. But it is worth watching. Give it a try.
3,Oy.,"I was really into this movie and thought it was funny, until the ending. Really ruined the whole rest of the movie for me."
5,Very amusing,Very silly romantic comedy movie. The men in the movie did an excellent job and believable. DVD also arrived on time and in excellent condition. Highly recommended
2,"What, precisely, were Hardy and Pine thinking?! (2-1/2 stars because of Hardy)","Very weak date comedy about a woman who is oblivious to the fact she is dating two different guys who happen to be best friends ... and co-workers, in the form of CIA intelligence agents; agents who eventually use all their spy skills and surveillance gear to keep tabs on each other (and sabotage each other) to win the girl. Pine's okay, Hardy's great, Witherspoon is meh - the movie overall silly, but okay if you have nothing else to watch."
5,movie,this movie is great. it is funny and full of action while also having a love story involved great for men and women
3,MY GRADE: C plus to B minus.,"Two CIA buddies end up pursuing the same romantic interest and using their spy skills and resources to try and one up each other. It's a hit or miss romantic comedy that has a couple of clever moments but is otherwise engaging for it's strong cast than it's well plotted tale. Some of the spy moves were not terribly realistic and took away from the tale for me, too.Chris Pine, Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy star in this love triangle. Yes, that was Angela Bassett in the picture as the boss. Seth Rogen, Sam Worthington and Bradley Cooper were all offered male leads but declined.The budget was $65M and it made over $165M at the Box Office.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; ROMANTIC CHEMISTRY: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minusSPOILER: Yeah, sneaking into her house and moving in her peripheral vision several times didn't work for me. She would have seen him. Duh."
4,Cute,"This was a cute movie. Not the type of movie that you remember for long, but it has some cute scenes and all-in-all we are glad we watched it."
4,Silly fun!,"Since I adore Reese Witherspoon, I decided to give This Means War a try. I'm glad I did, this action/romance flick is WAY better than I thought it would be. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play Witherspoon's love interests and they are both easy on the eyes! Witherspoon is fabulous as always and she looks smokin' hot as Lauren. This is just a fun and silly movie, it's not the kind of movie that will win awards but it's darn entertaining to watch. Give it a try, enjoy!"
3,"not bad, but not great either.","Just an ""okay"" movie. Not bad enough to turn off but not good enough to want to watch again. Reese Whiterspoon is always enjoyable to watch but this is not one of her better films."
5,Great movie!!,"This movie was fun to watch! Cast had good rhythm together, and it was funny, action packed and just a good way to spend a couple of hours. Tom Hardy is definitely an actor to watch in the future. I bought this movie and it was even better the second time! Rent or buy WARRIOR too if you want to see another good Tom Hardy flick."
2,Run of the Mill Comedy,"I watched this film because of the interesting mix up in the cast. The three leads all have different styles. Hardy is a very physical actor, Pine relaxed, and Witherspoon is sassy and take no prisoners. The performances weren't bad but, for me, the movie did not work. It might be that the script wants to be a romantic comedy, buddy movie (gal/guy pairs), and an action/spy flick. It adds nothing new to any of these genres. It is predictable and prosaic. Too many coinkydinks and too much boom boon took away from the plot line. I think we saw this same film in a better form a few years ago in when Edward Norton was contesting for a girl with his friend the priest. I have not seen a really good romantic comedy coming out of Hollywood in a long time. The best romance was in a film called ""Goon""...yep the knock your teeth out hockey movie. The subplot of the romance was original, sweet and believable."
3,Not a top Reese movie but fun,"Cute. Funny. Some great stuff but not a top 10 Reese movie. Makes you laugh, enjoyable but would not buy it. Glad I rented & didn't buy it."
3,not a great movie,"i bought this movie only because i like to have light fluffy stuff around for those times when i don't want to think too much and just want to relax. that being said, it's still below average for that kind of movie. it's really hard to get into the characters because they are so unbelievable. however, it did fulfill my desire not to think and just to relax."
1,This Means Awful,"A woman falls in love with two men: playboy and a good guy. Who does she choose? The playboy, of course! I was truly disappointed that an actress like Reese Witherspoon agreed to be in this trash. Besides its awful message the execution of the film is also terrible. It's so predictable at every turn. It was such a waste of time and money. Unless you want to waste 97 minutes of your life, I would say skip this!"
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","I love this movie. I loved it in the theater and I loved watching it again. However, it was almost ruined by a terrible, terrible DVD. I don't know how to explain the problem exactly, but it seemed to be some kind of interlacing problem. Also, the video was unnaturally bright, washing out the color on the faces and the few subtitles it had were awful looking and hard to read. Either way, it was annoying and although I know I didn't pay a fortune for the DVD, it still seems ridiculous that it would be so terrible."
2,"Awful, predictable garbage - don't waste your $$$","This film is one of the top 10 in the categories, ""Worst Screenplay"" and ""Worst Director"". The premise is interesting, but the screenplay is awful and the directing even worse. Some scenes were lifted straight from other movies, but so poorly written and staged that it's laughable. If you are looking for a second-rate romantic comedy and don't care how improbably or unrealistic the plot is, then this is a good movie for you."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this film, the dialogue, the contest, and the girl. I found Reese Witherspoon's sexy dancing captivating. It stands out. The movie has a feel-good happy ending that is perfectly contrived.May the best spy win!"
5,advide movie watcher,"Watching this movie once is not enough. It is full of comedy, action and romance so it would appeal to a wide audience and I have found that everyone I have lent this movie to watches more than once before returning it."
3,This Means War [HD],I download this movie (The Artist [HD]) and found it okay to watch. I think it is worth the purchase and worth downloading if you like this sort of film.
2,This show was dumb,A waste of Tom Hardy's talent. I cannot recall a single thing that made me laugh here. Spend your money elsewhere.
4,Adrenaline Charged Chick Flick,"At the pitch meeting they probably circled February 14 on the calendar. The question came up as to how we can make a date flick that has guy appeal, say, Nicholas Sparks with some firepower. I was a little dubious about this movie because it was directed by McG, the man who helmed the abysmal ""Charlie's Angels"" flicks. Never fear because McG has learned his lessons and toned down the quick cuts and pyrotechnics to deliver a servicable romance-comedy-action extravaganza. Matters are helped because the leads (Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy) are appealing prescences and make the film's more predictable elements tolerable. This wasn't a movie designed for posterity but one where a guy can get to third base and on that level it succeeds."
3,Too well signposted...,Watching this I realised early on how choreographed the films outcome was....Tuck is obviously more family orientated and his ex-wife is still only dating and therefore left open for them to hook up...which is a shame cos Chris Pine is completely out-shined in the acting chops department by Tom Hardy. Basically she picked the wrong guy....bad Reese!!
2,another dud with Reese,"Reese has been having a tough time picking and choosing movies as of late... This is yet another example of her poor choices. Don't bother watching it!! You can imagine the story line.... as boring as the movie jacket suggests..... Reese needs to start taking advice from Kate Hudson, who stars in similar story-lined movies.... but she makes better choices, usually. Again, do not bother wasting your time watching this movie!!"
2,What a waste,"I'm a huge Reese Witherspoon fan. But this movie did nothing for me. The way the 2 male characters acted, I didn't want any of them to end up with Reese's character. And why did she have to choose either of them? It was bad so don't watch with high expectations."
4,"It was different, funny","It was funny, exciting and most of all different from other movies in which we usually watch. We enjoyed the actors. We enjoyed the laugh."
1,DIRECTED BADLY!!!,"this movie had so much potential and actors that tried to deliver. but, when you watch this film, you find yourself distracted, consciously picking out either better ways to have shot many scenes or just flat out bad decisions by the director in general. oh and i don't know who's idea it was to cast a tired and one noted chelsea handler, but just because your friends with reese witherspoon doesn't mean you deserve to be in the same shots with her. i have nothing against McG or chelsea personally, but neither belong here. both filmed on auto pilot and/or left it to monkeys while taking a vacay to vegas. either way, lite on plot, disappointing all the way around."
1,What a Waste of Time and Money,"I love romantic comedies, so when I saw this movie I was excited. But I was disappointed during- and after the movie because it was horrible. I tried really hard to laugh, but I didn't succeed. And the movie is not romantic. I didn't enjoy the action. It's not a movie I would buy. I wasted my money and my time. Look elsewhere or you'll be sorry."
3,Fun movie!,"Loved the movie, cute actors, fun plot and laughs. Of course it would never happen, but who cares? This was a date movie, with a sexy Chris Pine, beautiful Reese Witherspoon, and Tom Hardy. Just enjoy it!"
3,Would not buy,"Ok, not great. Spy vs spy wod be better title. Funny but not great. If you have to watch chick flick there are worse movies. It was ok for rental"
4,cute,"Cute rom com movie. reese witherspoon does them so well and the two lead men are quite dashing. There is not a lot of substance in the movie, but if you want something mindless and fun, check it out."
3,This Means War,"If you enjoy romantic comedies you will probably enjoy this one with a dash of the thrilling espionage genre. Two agents for the CIA are like brothers and would die for each other. That is until a beautiful blond comes into their lives after one of the agents meets her through an online dating match up. She turns their world upside down and makes them both re-evaluate what is important in their lifes. Witherspoon has always been a favorite of mine sinceLegally Blonde, and Chris Pine ofStar Trek (2009)and Tom Hardy ofWarriorare great as the agents in a quandry. They both go to great government expense to spy on Reese, and each other with comedic results.CA Luster"
1,Wasted Time,"I really enjoy Reese Witherspoon. But, this movie was a complete disaster. The plot was absurd, the acting amateurish and the the whole thing just a waste of time."
3,Rental,It's what I expected from a rental. The sign up process was smooth and painless. I recommend to anyone with a wireless tv.
4,Entertaining rom-com with a spy twist,"Two secret agents fall for the same woman, and they attempt to apprehend a dangerous villain while vying for the lady's affection. Similar to some other spy-rom-coms of the past couple of years (True Lies, Knight and Day, Killers) but has the twist of the two competing.Entertaining, with plenty of action as well as humor, This Means War is ultimately a solid date film that provides fun for both partners in a couple as well."
4,This Means Lighthearted With Little to No Plot,"I always enjoy Reese Witherspoon, which was the major pull in me choosing to purchase this DVD; it was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon with nothing else to do. Though, I may rewatch from time to time, I would not list this movie as a favorite."
3,Not the funniest...,"This was not my favorite funny movie, although it had it's moments. I like Mr. Pine in more serious-ish roles, where his dry sarcasm can shine. I do love Reese...I wish she'd get some better roles."
1,Think twice before renting - silly dialogue,"We love Chris Pine and Renne Witherspoon but this movie was just bad! Sorry guys. The dialogue was poor, not close to reality, and derevative. Just silly! Not worth 3.99."
1,"Unintelligent garbage. Bad script, bad acting, FLOP!","This is seriously one of the worst movies of its release year. With an all star cast and a script written by a blind person on meth who would have thought this movie would tank so hard. Man did they over advertise for this movie as well. One scene after another with no real humor, obvious fake & staged fight scenes where the bad guy bends forward and waits to be clobbered like a puppet. Not one single shiny, smily, funny, or endearing moment in this movie. When the credits start rolling you almost jump up from the couch screaming ""YEAH.......YAH.....THANK GOD ITS OVER"". Serious pile of garbage here. Move along move along this is not the movie you are looking for."
2,Lousy Movie,"Trite and painful, hardly and effective representation nor parody of romance, friendship, or covert operations - best ignore this movie and find something else to do with your time."
4,If you want to smile...,"...watch this movie! It was definitely a cheesy romantic comedy, but it was a delight to watch. My expectations were pretty low when the movie started, but the storyline progressed pretty rapidly and it was honestly adorable! Highly recommend for a sweet way to spend your afternoon."
2,It Tried to be Funny,"Two CIA agents fall for the same girl and vie for her affections. This tried to be a light romantic comedy and failed. Reese Witherspoon orders up her ""perfect man"" like breakfast items on a menu. The characters are wooden and lifeless. Would someone please tell Chelsea Handler she's not funny and that her smut filled rants are annoying?"
1,Watched 15 minutes,"Quite seriously could not take more than 15 minutes of this movie. Don't waste your time. From what I saw, it tries to mesh a his/her (moviegoer) movie, but it is so beyond plausible it's laughable."
4,Light romantic fare,"Wow this movie combines my two of my favorite things: romance and action. I really liked this movie , mainly because no one had cancer, amnesia or someone trying to keep the lovers apart which tends to be the hallmark of modern day romantic movies. This was pure fun and that is exactly what I wanted today."
3,"Its not Art, Worth a show","If your looking for art, literature, or a blockbuster then don't bother being a movie critic because 98% of the shinola made in decades couldn't pass 3 stars. This movie was fun enough, to make muster with likable actors and enough action and humor, for 3 bucks.It would have been a great date movie if it had been a bit less sexist and a little smarter. However, like most of the hollywood bunk coming out, this show needs some party favors to make it go over a little smoother. Make sure your date has a glass, or two, of wine before the movie.3 stars is generally the best hollywood can do in 20 years, including Avatar, yea I said it. Tired of the pg 13 market."
3,Meh,"You know when you know right off the bat that the movie will be meh but you watch it anyway because it won't totally suck. I mean Reese witherspoon?! and I really hate to say this but I don't see the appeal of chelsea handler anymore....BUT i wasn't watching it for them. I was watching it for the beefcake that is Tom Hardy....yes, tom hardy and a glass of white wine=the perfect rainy sat night in."
3,This means War,"ok, I agree with this. Aside from all the laughs this movie deals with love, lust, friendships, trust, and other weighty emotions. However if you're looking for some sort of new insight or exclusive story twists you can just forget it."
4,Fun,"Nothing profound, but a good flick to watch with the ol ball and chain. Ha, im going to get slapped. Romantic action comedy kept us both entertained."
4,Good Tunes,"If you loved the movie, you will enjoy the music. IMO only a couple of really good songs, but well worth the purchase. These are the songs directly from the movie, so while listening to it, you will be able to thing back to the parts of the movie you heard them."
2,Old Flics Gone New,This is a decent movie but does not touch the original RollerBall!! Thank You. It plays great!
3,not a film--a docudrama,"I was expecting a biographical film like Brother Sun, Sister Moon. I had read Spoto's book and loved it. However, this is really a documentary, with only brief re-enactments of Francis's life. The bulk of the 60 minute content is clips from interviews with ""experts in the field"". So this is useful, but not what I would have purchased, if I had understood this before. Not a film--a short docudrama."
1,Francis of Assisi,"This is not a film, like it says in the box. I feel very disapointed because there was not real description on this dvd item.It also put under doubt the real saint that he was. When you buy something like this is because you believe in it.It was so awful to me, I didn't bought a discussion I bougth a movie of the SAINT."
3,Not a film--a short docudrama,"I was expecting a biographical film like Brother Sun, Sister Moon. I had read Spoto's book and loved it.

So this is useful, but not what I would have purchased, if I had understood this before. Not a film--a short docudrama."
4,Instraments and Composers nothing else.,There are many beautiful pictures of many instruments and composers (not very modern ones). There are no definitions of musical terms or anything about notation or symbols in music. This book is great for seeing instruments and getting to know Classical and Romantic composers.
1,Not Long enough,"I had this installed by a professional shop, they said that they have ran into this problem before that it was not going to be long enough to clear my windshield and they were right. They had to do a lot of extra work to make it fit. I looked up online and seems this is a universal problem most people saying they have to make there own. So I would not recommend this extender."
5,Captivating Stories,"While purchased for our six year old grandson, both he and his older brother (who is nine) listened to all three books on the cd in one night. They throughly enjoyed it and want to have the next set. This CD has opened up the whole series of ""Geronima Stilton"" stories for both boys and they are eager to go to bed at night to listen to this CD over and over as they settle down to go to sleep."
5,Everyone must own this...,This is a great album. Period.The songs range in length from a minute to almost fourteen--and every single bit of it is great.
5,Extremely creative!!!!,"Some people judged the album and artist on the basis that the band members were gay... almost obnoxiously so for some. Even though I disagree totally with the lifestyle and political views, I have to admit that Holly was a pure down and out brilliant musical genius. He and his band members were also brilliant and extremely talented musicians... virtuosos all! I danced to ""Relax"" in San Diego in the 80's at a big dance club called Confetti's. On a friday night I was with my wife on the dance floor, when as soon as the opening notes to Relax began playing, the drink servers went into a coreographed dance routine on the multi level dance floor and stairs. The crowd went wild and joined them. It was an event to be experienced!!! Holly's music makes you live to dance!"
3,Pure pompous pop,"3 1/2Though slightly short of the glam masterwork its history may suggest, this album is still one of the more satisfyingly cheesy, occasionally utterly triumphant discs of that decedent decade."
3,"The music seems to ask, ""what's your pleasure?""","The atonal quality of Holly Johnson's mad-sex-scientist delivery and the dense, false-disco beat should have resulted in a disaster, but just the opposite happens: the grooves inherent in the mix, although nearly cancelled out by the sterile production, are extremely catchy--just try getting ""The Only Star in Heaven"" outta your head!--and the ballad ""The Power of Love"" seems to ache in real longing(Johnson should've nabbed an Oscar for this performance, as opposed to a Grammy; it is quite actorly in its grandeur). The album has its duds, and we all know where this act went after the initial thrill died down, but it's a touchstone for the '80's, and a high watermark it is for the post-glam era."
4,One of the Best Of The 80S,"Yes, It is one of the best albums of the 80s. As for Sound it is the best album of the 80s one of the first full digital recordings. However one problem the current release is not the original album. It's missing the album version of ""Two Tribes"" which is twice as long as the single version(which is the current version) and a track called ""Happy Hi""."
2,Relax Isn't Relax,"I purchased this CD mainly for the song ""Relax."" The problem is, this version of ""Relax"" isn't the one I wanted. I listened to the sampler of this song, but it was too short for me to be sure it was the song I wanted. After all, I didn't know that there were two versions of ""Relax."" The version I wanted is the one on ""Bang: Greatest Hits."""
5,PERFECT!1,Exactly what I needed.....Thanks. These 2 relays are very important. The truck could not run without them. Thanks for the quick service and excellant response...I WILL return for future purchases!
3,The Grand Cru,"The unit is attractive and well-manufactured. Description should be SURE to include that this cannot be vented to the outdoors. The installation instructions included with the unit give the wrong dimensions. Without careful measurement of the unit itself, it could be installed improperly. Cooling fine, noise level acceptable."
1,Do not buy this,Very noisy and a waste of money. Thankfully I took a 5 year warranty on the unit. The first one lasted 2.5 years. The replacment has lasted less than a year. Simply awful.
5,My new favorite shoes,"I walk all day at work, and these are very comfortable and classy looking. A hard combination to find. I have very hard to fit feet, they are pretty wide.These fit fine."
4,Good,"Not up to his later works but none the less a good novel. Fast paced plot, though a little dated. Would recommend Coben fans read it but do not read this as your first novel by this author. I warmed to the book as it progressed. For the first 20% was not sure i was going to enjoy it."
1,Don't waste your time,"i am a Harlan Coben fan, but this book was terrible. If you are an extreme liberal and you hate all conservatives, you may like it though. Not only was it extremely ""preachy,"" but many boring parts written about someone's tie or someone's past boyfriend or something that had nothing to do whatsoever with the plot. I ended up skimming through most of the book. It was not one of his better books. And not everyone who is against abortion or homosexuality or considers themselves a Christian is a ""lobomized follower"")."
3,Miracle Cure needs a doctor.,Miracle Cure is a predictable formulated Harlan Coben novel. No surprises here - reads like all the rest. I think it's time to retire the formula.
2,Reads like written by somebody else,Harlan Coben actually warns us about this book in his Note from the Author. He suggests to pick another of his novels. I should have listened. Very naive and not believable. Didn't like characters either.
1,amateur hour,"About half way through this piece of crap I realized that the book was written in 1991 when Mr. Coban had not yet honed his craft to today's expectations. The dialogue is horrendous, the characters are shallow stereotypes and the plot is disgraceful. Luckily, this was the first book I borrowed using the Amazon/Public Library interface so it didn't cost me anything. If I could have rated this book a zero, I would have."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could,"Shame on all of those involved for even publishing it. I'm less then a quarter of the way through, with nothing else in the house to read, and I can't force myself to read another word. All of the profits from this turd should be donated to charity... AIDS/HIV Research would be appropriate.I've read most of,Harlan Cobin books. He's obviously given up, so I won't be spending any more money to read his old collage efforts."
1,What a letdown.....,"I love most Harlan Coben books and was excited to see a new one by him, apparently I did not read the small print as to when this book was written and spent $10 on a very, very dated concept and storyline. I started reading and something seemed off - the whole ""gay/AIDS/gay predjuce"" theme seemed so dated. Then little things like ""car phone"" instead of cell phone and the crazy ""San Fran gay scene"" made me go huh??? Then a character says something like seven years ago in 1984 and I finally got it - I paid a new release price for some old re-issue and not even a good one. Don't bother on this one - not one of his best efforts and the dated story and references will just drive you crazy. Didn't even finish it."
5,Coben does it again,"Harlen Coben does great twists and turns throughout this book. I always find myself trying to find the twist, guess the bad guy, but there's always a little something that isn't revealed. As usual, it's an exciting read."
3,Slow story plot,"This is the third book of of Harlan Coben's that I have read and definitely my least favorite. It has a very slow story plot. If I hadn't bought the book I would have quit reading it by chapter 5. It is also pretty graphic and at times a little offensive. If you are a fan of Coben, considering skipping this one."
4,Interesting story,"I like Harlan Coben's work. I read a lot of his early sports novels and always thought he had a good eye for description and a good ear for dialogue. This was a good story-fast plot, good characters and overall, a satisfying read. Fans of Coben won't be disappointed."
4,20 Years and still interesting,"If you bought the newly reissued Paperback version of ""Miracle Cure"", you probably noticed a letter from Coben, just inside the Front Cover. He asks readers who are reading him for the first time to return the Book. The Book was Coben's second novel. I wonder why he wrote that note. Does he want to hide the fact that his books have regressed, rather than Improved.""Miracle Cure"" is a fine read. Outside of ""Caught"" I THINK this is better than anything Coben has since written.The book was written around the time that ""Magic"" Johnson announced that he had AIDS, and Coben ""Borrows"" from that event. Also there is a religous leader who may (or may not) be based on Jerry Falwell.Book moves right along and holds the readers interest. And unlike most Coben's books has a satisfactory ending."
3,Better than Nothing,"Out of town for work, looking at the discount book shelf and hey there is a Coben for $ 5.95. Even if is a three star. It is a Coben and it will give me six hours of fun and distraction.That is what it did. And that is how many stars a give it compared to all his other work. Novel plot, maybe a little dated, and a touch of a political view as well. But for $ 5.95 read it. If your a Coben fan you won't be disappointed."
1,Terrible,"I love the Bolitar novels, but this is dreck. Is this something he wrote in high school? I've seen better writing on bathroom walls. If I were one of the characters in this novel, I'd commit suicide, too."
3,MIRACLE CURE,"I READ ALL OF HARLAN COBENS BOOKS AS SOON AS THEY COME OUT,I ENJOYED THIS BOOK, BUT NOT HIS BEST WORK.I JUST LOVE THE WAY HE DOE'S ALL THESE TWIST AND TURNS,AND YOU NEVER GUESS THE ENDING."
2,BOOK,"I really like Harlon Coben books, but this one I did not like. Could be it was one of his 1st books and it was very old (1980's). But otherwise I love his books!"
2,Not one of his best,"I'm a big fan of Mister Coben, and I've read all of his books.But unless you want to learn everything there is to know about AIDS,and like everybody else, I have friends who have died from this horrible disease,it's just not a pleasant read."
2,"Fast-paced, but otherwise terrible","MIRACLE CURE, Coben's second novel, is the worst book by Harlan Coben I've ever read.The plot is contrived, the characters are corny, and the theme is pro-gay to the point of being preachy. The sex scenes are sleazy and made me feel like I was reading pornography.Despite the fact that this book reads like a manual on how not to write a good novel, somehow, Coben makes the reader want to know what happens next. Nowhere near the page-turning caliber of his later novels, Coben gift as a story teller still manages to come through loud-and-clear."
2,Not too great,I am a fan of harlan's book but for some reason the characters didn't appeal to me. Sara and Michael a bit too picture perfect. Didn't like it much to be totally honest. Could take it or leave it
3,I should have read this on a long flight,"I read this book in installments over several nights after going to bed. I should have read it on a long flight. The story started out in a gripping manner. I never forgot where I was in the story as I read but last night, with something like 20% of the book to still read, I couldn't stop. I turned out the light once but then turned it back on and finished. I still didn't know who the main bad character was, but now the tension was building and I had to find out. It reminded me a bit of the cold war spy novels I read in years past...a number of side stories, not so perfect people, some predictability that was saved by some interesting twists. Turned out....but I don't want to give this away, so just go ahead and download Miracle Cure and read it for yourself."
3,a young novel,"His second novel, back in print, is fast-paced but he has matured since then, thank goodness. I liked reading it, but liked finishing it more. He has come a long way and I like his older, more sophisticated characters much, much better."
3,easy reading,Nice twist in the end but could have had more character.Description of the victims could have been more detailed.Beach book.
3,"Good Text, But No Color","I was a little disappointed that all of the pictures were blackand white. In order for this book to be useful to me, I would have topay [approx. $20.] plus shipping and handling to get the actual swatches used in this reference book.The text seemed to be very thorough and all fabric types are covered. For the price, I would have expected color photos of the swatches since it is difficult to judge texture from black and white. If you don't mind investing [more money] for the swatches, you'll be happy with this book."
4,Good book!,"I bought this book for a Textile class I was taking. It's a good book, and has lots of information in it. Although it is only useful if you have the sample swatches to glue on each page so that you can see and feel the fabrics. I will keep this book as a great ""reference book"" for future use."
5,Within the Gates,Book arrived in very good shape (2 copies). I loaned an earlier copy to a friend and didn'get it back. It is a wonderful insight into the afterlife and literally changed my life after I lost my Mother 20 years ago. Excellent and easy reading.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Here, the Count is a Fiorentina fan. He has set himself up in a nicehouse, with secret rooms for vampire type sleeping, and others forwhacky chemical experiments.He has the friendship of a Medici, and the bed warming of a niceDonna. His powerful friend kicks the bucket, and a rather nastiergentlemen, a crazy Catholic comes to power and introduces a reign ofterror."
1,The Palace,I just finished reading the Palace and I have to say it wasn't what I expected. The beginning had me interested but by the middle of the book I just wanted to get it over with.I found myself skimming through tiresome letters and skipping entire paragraphs. Not an entertaining book at all. More of a history lesson if that.
3,boring,"Just like Hotel Transylvania, same recipe. Not enough vampirism for my taste. Events like plague and religious persecution are glossed over and used to facilitate a silly romantic subplot. Disappointing. Too many letters from this one to that one detract from the flow of the story."
5,a real dandy,ive foud about two dollars and eighty cents in change in about a 6 hrs my 4yr old son loves treasure hunting with me it gives us a fun thing to do together so far it works great and it tells you if the metal below it is a coin or if its iron i would recommend this before buying a more expensive model i think i paid like 90 dollars for it great price to spend quality time with my son
2,Disappointed,"I spent several days reviewing different metal detectors before I choose the Bounty Hunter Silver model. One of the reasons for selecting this model was the fact that it could distinguish between gold, coins and metal objects. I needed one to detect gold items as I had lost a gold wedding band (given to me by my gradfather) in the back yard. After assembling the detector (which was very easy to do) and turning the item on, it made a contast hissing noise and, no matter which setting I put it on, the detector's noise was the same.Two others tried to work with the detector with the same results. I am not sure whether I just got one that was defective or if others have had the same problem. In any event, I had to return the item and, I am happy to report, that returning the item was as promised."
3,Great fun,"For beginners its great.Until you know which sounds to listen for be ready to dig up junk.The kids and I had a great time.I will be purchasing a more expensive model for myself,we are hooked."
4,"So far, so good!","This is our first metal detector, so we have nothing to compare it against. But just for the experience, it seems to work well. Good at detecting the advertised ""up to 6 inches"" depth claim, but hard to pinpoint the exact spot - tones cover a pretty good area. Also, the ""junk rejection"" feature works well. Overall, we're happy - just waiting for that first BIG find!"
2,Don't expect to find anything,"The detector arrived with no shipping damage and was easy to set up, however the users manual could have been more detailed. In using the detector it seemed very erratic it its identification of metal. It would beep as you swept over an area and then once you dig down a ways and try to continue to hone in on the metal it would stop beeping having found nothing. Adjusting the sensitivity didn't seem to help and so far the detector has been pretty unusable in its intended purpose. Going to try it with headphones to see if that helps."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this metal detector to help me find iron corner stakes on my property in order to verify a surveyed property line. I found some of the corner stakes by other means, but as of yet I have not found one by using this detector. For me, this has been a waste of my money."
2,DETECTOR FLUCTUATES TOO MUCH EVEN WITH NEW BATTERIES,"This is our second detector for under 100.00. We bought this one on the basis that because it says it's built by 'bounty hunter' which was thought to be a brand name. That it would function better than the other which is an off brand...not! The identifying indicator fluctuates way too much and is undependable even with new batteries. Our other off brand is far more dependable at identifying the targets. This is the last cheapie and the last Bounty Hunter. I recommend spending the extra money for a better machine like Garrett. They hold value also. I use a Garrett 'Gold Stinger' and it sells for the same now as it did 7 yrs ago when I bought it and worth every penny for the serious prospector and hunter. The next I get for my wife will be Ace 250. Thanks, hope this helps."
3,Bounty Hunter,This item is mid grade for metal detecting and does a good job.The seller I purchased from is a different story. They charge $44 for 8 day delivery. The metal detector was $107. Poor business practice.
1,Buy a used older one or spend more $ elsewhere...,"Very disappointed in this product. Did not work Christmas morning, was not even in new package. Felt ripped off! The quality was not there. Took a couple of weeks for the return to go through.. I thought I did my research but clearly did not!"
4,Good book/honest review,"This book tells much history of candle burning. It is a very serious and well done book that covers alot of ground. However I must say, that these rituals do not come cheap. Some of the candles themselves can cost $25.00 or more and that's not to mention the oils. And you don't just burn one candle here.. for just one ritual you can need up to five or six special candles and oils. A fantastic book to be sure.. But you better be prepared to do alot of money drawing rituals.. because your going to need alot of green to make this magic work for you."
4,A Basic Guide to Candle Magic,"This book is the classic and basic guide to candle magic. It should be in the library of everyone who does candle work, as well as those who practice other forms of Hoodoo, witchcraft, or other magical work.It's only fault is that it is dated, but te author is the expert in this field, so the book ages well, although all of the fancy new candles and their assocaited spells are not present."
3,Well Written but Archaic,"The information contained in the book is the source material for many of the great Wiccan authors on Candle Magic. The most prominent example is Raymond Buckland in ""Practical Candleburning Rituals"", then strong glimmers come through in Scott Cunningham (see pages 101-104 of ""Earth Power"") and then there are strong hints in D.J. Conway's ""A Little Book of Candle Magic"".The Master Book of Candle Burning probably would appeal to someone, spiritually, of a past era. However, the book needs to be on the shelf of serious Wiccan and magical students for historical study and to delve into systems and intricacies of the layouts."
4,Tales abound,Purchased this as a gift for my lady who rarely put it down. Full of excellent real life adventure stories of ladies who were largely unbound by the social restraints of the era. Well written and compiled.
4,Gift for an aviator,This was actually purchased for my father who had it on his wish list.He is an old Air Force guy and wanted it since he believed that it was more about flying.In reality it's a story about relationships and human nature.His wife appreciated the movie more than he did so all was not lost.The lesson here is to read the reviews when possible to help make an informed decision.
4,Fear of Intimacy,"Anne wants to prove to herself and the world that she's defective and unlovable by choosing men whom she knows are either unavailable (married pilot) or whom she can easily keep at bay(20 year old Francois). She says she's a ""maneater"" and poor Francois is so hungry for love that he denies reality to keep his fantasy alive. A nice coming of age movie and according to Enigma, ""to learn to live and love - that's what we are here for."""
3,Interesting study of relationships,"The most intriguing thing about this movie happened at the very end, giving insight into the main male character and piquing some interest... the movie is unfortunately not otherwise intriguing, and I am sorry to have to give it only three stars. Worth seeing if you like philosophical conversations about men and women and relationships, adultery and jealousy and happiness... there isn't a lot of substance otherwise, I'm afraid."
1,Returned. My Amazon A-Z Guarantee claim is still pending.,"A large cardboard box of 'starlight mints'. Product of Columbia. They get the the 25 pounds by making each candy as big as a large gumball from a candy machine. It's as big as the inside of our mouth almost. BIG. With choking hazard notices all over the wrapping.The flavor was like cheap, hard candy without glaze on the outside of the candy and very low spearmint flavor that was hard to detect outside of the overpowering cheap white sugar flavor.Avoid this seller unless you know exactly what they are shipping."
2,Really bad,"This game is horrible. when i got this game i thought it would be great, like the other R6 games, boy was i wrong. The AI is too smart, they even shoot you if you are completly silent and out of site, makeing the levels impossible. You die in 2 shots, the graphics could be much better, and to top it off, there are only 5 levels. Your best bet is to get Rogue spear."
4,a great game,i got this game with my ps1 at a amazing game store so i could not wait to play! but hook up took like two hours so did not get to play this until 2 day's later and it is great! but 5 missions? it's short but fun but you can shoot at a enemy 9 times miss he hits you two or three times you die it's very fun but just dos not fell like a r6 game i would reccmomnd it
1,it doesn't get any worse,"Can you believe how many bad games are really out there? This game does nothing right. I can barely control the guy, enemies are able to find and kill me in a matter of seconds before I have ANY time to react, and the game is incredibly short. The Playstation One simply couldn't handle the Tom Clancy games. Avoid."
2,This game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rainbow six: lone wolf is the worst game I've ever played. The graphics suck, the game is way to short and there is no replay value to it. The wepones you can use are basic and are not that great looking. If your going to buy this game, don't. Its a wast of money and time."
3,Rainbow Six : Lone Wolf,"I'm Just goessing that this game wont be that great,mosty because the graphcis won't be that good. the second reason is because it is only $14.99. I can asure you that the gameplay will be pretty good. The reason I know that is because I have every Rainbow Six game ever made."
4,"A very useful, very unfunny book","This book is great for explaining grammar in a very basic way. It answers a lot of persistent, nagging questions, and it's very clearly written.But the author just really wants to be funny.And she's not.At all.The humor that she hopes will make the book more accessible just makes the book annoying, and actually gets in the way of the lessons it teaches...which is too bad, because the lessons could stand alone. Her advice is great, she gives it well, and the book could be considered useful for any writer anywhere....For anyone writing in english, anyway."
5,a good book,I had ordered this for a class I'm taking and found that I am now picking up bad grammar all over the place! A very funny book that subtly gets you thinking in good grammar.
5,Easy to understand grammar rules with a humorous edge,"This book is fantastic. My partner and I will occasionally just read from it as a point of curiosity and interest, not only when we're looking for a specific answer. It breaks grammar down into small, easy to understand lessons, using a lot of humor along the way. Even the most confusing grammar rules seem simple and straighforward in this book. A good book to have around!"
5,English As An A+,Great book for those who have trouble keeping up with the English words.Excellent resource.
1,Prescriptivist Nonsense,"In linguistics, grammatical ""experts"" are referred to as prescriptivists--those who say that there is a right way and a wrong way to use a language. Query, however, what is the point of a language--to communicate an idea between people. So long as you can meet this objective, a linguist would say you have met your goal. Saying, as Ms. O'Conner does, that you shouldn't talk to certain people due to their grammatical choices only reinforces an elitist attitude which is almost religious in nature where grammatical prophets are deemed heretics and outcast from the elite just as quickly. Instead, we should appreciate the differences among people, see the beauty in the differences in language, try not to offend others with our language, and appreciate the beautiful miracle that is language. To do otherwise is to miss out on the wonder of spontaneous order that is language."
5,Woe Is I,"As a writer and editor, I have recommended this book to many people world. It is easy to read, entertaining, and formatted such that items are easy to find."
3,A little too basic for me,"Many of the Amazon reviewers said this book is valuable for both novices and experienced professionals, and it's funny to boot. I read four chapters and put the book aside. I've been a technical writer since 1970, and knew I wouldn't find too much new here, but decided to take a chance on it for the humorous aspects. In my opinion, it's funny in spots, but waaaaay too basic. I don't need to be told again the difference between there, they're, and their. Nor do I need to be told when to use it's instead of its.For a writing-related book that's valuable for both novices and experienced professionals, try ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves."""
2,"Helpful, but too annoying","There is tons of helpful practical information in this book, so I won't say it's not worth reading, but I found her sense of humor to be quite annoying after a while (a short while) and some of her attitudes towards people with poor grammar to be obnoxious (there again I know she was trying to be funny, but I wasn't amused). I would recommend trying Bill Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome words. Its the same kind of stuff, but I much prefer his writing style as well as his sense of humor. Though there are actually a few disagreements between the two books (like usage of dove vs. dived, and whether ""anyways"" is a word."
4,Slow delivery,"Although it came at the very last date given, I was surprised when the other two books I ordered at the same time, came 2 weeks earlier. I like the book itself, althoug some of the fonts are difficult to read. Small problem"
3,it's okay,Straps not long enough to go around a regular neck so it showed like a necklace. I had to tie to my bra strap. so was inconvenient to use.
2,quality diminished,"The bra stash I had from Austin House was very handy on a recent trip to Italy. However when ordering more for gifts the quality seems to have diminished. Mine has quality fabric and an understated warm neutral color. The new order, also made by Austin House, is a bright white satin (not the neutal color on the box they came in) and the quality of the fabric is marginal. Perhaps the old one can be made available in the future. Thank you."
2,Does not do the job,"The fabric is too thin and the color too light. It rides up and right out of my blouse, even with the weight of the credit card, license and cash."
4,Good that doesn't quite cross over into Greatness,"I bought this anthology for the Sharon Shinn story and adored that one. She picked up a thread I really wanted to see resolved and wove it in quite satisfactorily. Always ready for new authors in this genre, I read the rest of the book. The other three stories, by Sarah Monette, Claire Delacroix and Lynn Kurland, were good. Perfectly nice to wile away an hour or two but not so outstanding you want to go out and buy a book by them (although Ms. Kurland almost has me just because I also enjoyed her short story in ""To Weave a Web of Magic""). Thus, my four stars. Good, great for Ms. Shinn's tale, just solid fairytale/romance/magic/fantasy. Enjoy."
3,Not bad for a rainy Sunday read,"This collection features 4 novellas from some of the leading romantic fantasy writers. All 4 stories are enjoyable but the stand out for me is Sharon Shinn's contribution. This story fits into the world of her Twelve Houses series and follows a character fans of this series know, Darryn Rappengrass. This is a delicious meeting of a humorous loyal man and Sosie, the strong girl who helped save her sister in Mystic & Fire. This story is worth the price of the book for me. I couldn't help but smile reading it. The Ice Queen is also a nice read but the rest just can't hold a candle to Shinn in my opinion."
1,where is my item?,"My item was purchased on August 22, 2012 and had to arrive between Friday, September 7, 2012 -Monday, September 24, 2012. Today, September 26 it's still not here and seems impossible to track the package."
1,Bitter Disappointment,"Unless you have NEVER read a SINGLE book on Diana and Charles, you will not find a scrap of new information here. I did not find a sentence that I have not read at least 10 times before. Additionally, it left out too much important information to be be a good, all-inclusive read."
2,Very hard to learn,Does anyone use this product to build or manage a website? Let me hear about it from non-IBMers. Even the sample didn't work for me. Not for nervous users like me. Online docs seem to indicate it needs WebSphere Application Server and DB2. Beware of System requirements! Is there any hardcopy book?
1,I'm SO disappointed!!!,"I LOVE Grey Flannel by Geoffrey Beene...I know this scent well. This is NO Grey Flannel that I've received. It smells more like Hi Karate. The kicker is that it is not returnable, being a hazardous material and all. I'm SO disappointed!!!"
3,fine entry in the series,THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES is an altogether fine entry in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series.Alan Arkin and Art Carney stars as the con-artists who fool a vain and ruthless Emperor (Dick Shawn) into believing that they can create the most exquisite of clothes that are invisible to those who are foolish or unworthy. Legendary British songstress Georgia Brown co-stars as a wise innkeeper.
5,Dick Shawn is outstanding as the Emperor,I have watched this video at least six times. Each time I see something more in it. Dick Shawn- who plays the fashion crazy emperor- simply steals the show. It is the type of short film you like to watch when you want a good laugh and not have to think too hard. My kids also have enjoyed it because it is really a very funny film. I highly recommend this production.
1,Remastered?,A2Z's definition of remastered is a cheap bootleg in cheaper packaging. The Vampire Bat print in the 50 Horror Classics boxed set is nearly as good and it has 49 more movies and can be had for the same price as this DVD-R. Ive been an Amazon customer for several years and have seen a steady decline in their screening process. They really need to upgrade the quality control on what they sell.
1,Poor 1930's Horror Flick,"The Vampire Bat is a really lame horror flick. How lame? Consider its plot and ask yourself just how many times have you seen the same basic scenario.The Vampire Bat is set in the village of Klineschloss where villagers are found dead, drained of their blood with two small holes in their necks. Naturally, everyone suspects that a vampire is at work. Of course superstitious villagers start running around with torches.Dwight Frye has a significant role in this flick as the red herring. This may very well be Frye's best performance of all time. However, that is more than counterbalanced by the strikingly poor performances of horror regulars Lionel Atwill & Fay Wray not to mention Melvyn Douglas.The Vampire Bat is a pretty lame flick that is a waste of your time and money."
4,Get out your boom box,"I haven't heard any of Lo Fidelity All Stars' full length CD's. That said, I like this single a lot. 'The All, The All' got stuck in my head for a few days. With trippy sirens and swirling symphony sounds, it sounds like a really cool eighties song, then switches gears with a faster beat. The instrumental is helpful for those who might not like the treated vocals. 'Voodoo House' starts out as gripping but pretty standard big beat fare, then throws in some space age jazzy organ sounds to shake and stir things up a bit. 'Just Enough' is mellow, lounge-y electronic pop that is pleasant but not especially memorable. All in all, 'The All, The All' is a great tune that I'll probably play over and over for a while."
1,Dangerously full of 'junk science'; a disservice to all...,"Sadly ""the AIDS WAR..."" is nothing more than a collection of tired old worn out articles/pseudo 'studies' which are put forth in a dangerous effort to convince the reader that AIDS is not caused by the HIV virus, but rather by drugs.This book, its author, and the associated theories have been thoroughly discredited over the years. Its real danger is that uninformed readers may actually believe what's put forth in this book, and make life style or behavior decisions based on what they read -- potentially placing those people at greater risk of both contracting HIV, and attempting to remain healthy and live longer if infected.This book does a huge disservice to anyone who reads it."
2,Somewhat useful,"Basically what this book does is list a topic and several questions under that topic that you may be asking yourself. Then it gives scripture passages from the New Living Translation. After some of the scripture, whoever wrote the book then paraphrases scripture into whatever he/she thinks it means. I found this paraphrasing unneccessary. People who are new in Christ or new at reading the bible may be swayed by someone else's opinion and then may not seek the wisdom from God to understand what they have just read. I also found some of the scripture was taken out of context. Overall, I would say that this book is helpful in finding scripture related to certain topics, but it is best read with your bible open so you can read the scripture right out of God's word in it's original context. This book shouldn't be used to read instead of the bible."
4,fine!,"again an album by anna vissi that shows that annas album sold 100, 000 in the 1980s!!!!! which is brilliant:) excellent album.buy now!xx"
3,Not Bad At All ! Anna is always great!,"One of the classic albums of Anna Vissi! Not all songs are top hits, but it is recommended to all the fans!"
5,"A fantastic book, but not what I expected",This book actually made me consider Roman Catholicism as the points Chemnitz made and the sources he cited seemed to strongly prove trans-substantiation as opposed to con-substantiation. He says he will prove the Lutheran point of view but then goes on to firmly enforce the Roman Catholic view. This book led to quite a change in my view on the Eucharist.
2,Arabian love poems,"Mr. Qabani is very famous in the arab culture. His reputation comes from the sensitive and sentimental poems he writes about love and women. Unfortunately, the collection of poems in this item did not represent well the work he is famous for."
3,Language Limitations,"I must say that I found the various translations of Qabbani's poetry weak and lacking in the author's intended color and imagery. If the reader is not well-versed in the arabic language, he or she will not gain the full effect of the text."
5,A rich and sensual read,"As a poetry lover, it is a shame that I have only recently discovered Nizar Kabbani, one of the Arabic world's best-known contemporary poets. His _Arabian Love Poems_ are vivid, powerful, intense with beautiful imagery and a poignant tone. For readers of Arabic, it is also dual language. In any case, a marvelous collection. Highly recommended."
3,2 1/2 stars,"This was my first book by Julia Justiss. I didn't like it because the hero was too passive for my tastes. I prefer the ""alpha male"" character. I found several inconsistancies with the plot and thought the slang terms hard to understand.Most of the book deals with the hero being wounded and bed-ridden. The story starts out strong, but loses steam about halfway through.Not a keeper for me."
3,A refreshing look at the history of the Hebrew Bible,"William M. Schniedewind tackles the questions of 'when' and 'why' the Bible was written; contesting that who wrote it was not fundamentally important to ancient Isreal. The extent of the book delves into the historical advancement of orality to textualization. He presents multiple viewpoints of opposing authors, and addresses each accordingly. The time spent on writing being discussed internal of Biblical literate was a little lengthy, but the overall point he was attempting to convey was still successful. I would recommend this book to those strong in faith, questioning faith, and those simply curious in the history of a book that is sacred to billions around the world. The language is very simple; allowing someone who has no prior knowledge to understand 90% of the text."
3,For those interested in the history of the Bible,"How the Bible Became a Book is about the history of the bible from the origins of writing, to that of a transition from a mostly oral society to a written society. The author traces the many events that led to the eventual creation of the written text of the bible. The manner in which the book was written could be confusing at times if you do not have a lot of prior knowledge of ancient history or of the bible. Overall, I found the book to be very informative. I barely had any prior knowledge or interest of the bible before reading the book, but I managed to learn many new things. If anyone is very interested in the history of the bible, this is a good book for you. Even though I did not have a burning desire to learn about the historical aspect of the bible, I still found the book to be worth a read."
3,"longest comments = malibu, CA?","what is going on with these gigantic comments all coming from various writers in malibu, California?any theories? i think either this author has a cult there, or something is going on here...Todd"
2,The Bible's history simplified.,"How the Bible Became a Book by William M. Schniedewind tackles this important questions of when and why the bible was actually written. Schniedewind also focuses upon the following questions: ""where did the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) come from?"", ""where was it written?"", ""how was it written?"". The book explores Israel's conversion from an oral society to a written society."
1,B.C.E.,"As a Christian and one whom believes each and every word in the Old and New Testatments, whenever I see the term ""B.C.E."" (Before The Common/Current Era) I know I will be reading an errant opinion/book. This also goes for that ""B.C.E."" using History Channel, Discovery Channel, and, at times, History Internationl Channel. Most of the intelligent world uses ""A.D."" (Anno Domini, year of our Lord), so B.C.E. prejudices the views of 90% of the world which is Christian. Not for me to even explore..."
1,Watch if for the Figgis.,"A trio of mini-TV movies based on short stories by outmoded American writers. 'Kansas' is 'The Wizard of Oz' updated to working class New York in 1939, on the eve of war, with Kyra Sedgewick as an awful wife longing for escape, forcing her boxer husband (Matt Dillon) into a potentially fatal fight.'Dilemma', paying homage to the 1950s Hollywood melodrama, features Ray Liotta as an advertising executive, having nightmares because of work pressure, alco-wife, fears for his kids, and the possibility that he might have to go fight in Korea.Mike Figgis' 'Mara' is what you'd expect from a Henry Miller story set in Paris, much talking of talks, little walking of walks.The first two films are done in the style of glum Masterpiece Theatre (e.g. Eugene O'Neill), with contrived situations and stilted dialogue. figgis, hampered by poor material, squeezes some of the empathetic visual magic he would perfect in 'One Night Stand'."
2,Hunter(you better not be in single player mode)the reckoning,"Well,... in single player this game is tediousat best a will last 2 days, thats how long ittook me to finish it... and finishing it camewith an complete desire to Never play it everagain.... alone that is.With more than 1 personthis is great game to laugh about and spend acouple of hours playing, but it still gets tediousand seems pointless very shortly, i don'treccomend this game unless you like mindlessgaming experiences."
2,Boring,"I was bored of this game within a few minutes. It seemed like it would be a better Gauntlet and looked like it was going to deliver. The opening screens are amazing and graphics during the game are great. However, gameplay just isn't interesting. You pick your character and then run around and kill hordes of creatures with a variety of weapons. That's it. To make it more annoying, the camera doesn't move well with you at all, making it difficult to see what you need (want) to see.Although Gauntlet falls far short of Hunter in the graphics department, it is much better overall game. I'll stick with that."
3,Move over Gauntlet,"This game has a very familiar old school gauntlet feel to it.With the exception that you cant keep feeding quaters in, you must earn your extra lives to keep playing. This gory relic is a lot of fun to play single player, but the multiplayer features (where it should shine in my opinion) are depressing. The way the camera pans to follow one player or another, it is very easy to get your friends stuck behind objects or in a horde of the dead.. Baldurs Gate uses a much more user friendly camera panning system allowing either player to pan the camera at will...3 stars - worth playing, especially at the lowered price."
4,Great multiplayer action game,"Hunter is a fun multiplayer game. With options to turn off friendly-fire damage to off or on, this game also requires people to watch who they shoot at and make sure they dont actually hit their own allies and just the monsters."
2,"""hunter"" aint all that","this game looks nice and is mildly entertaining, but, is much too short, much too easy and overall, a let down. if you enjoy games that last more than 4 hours: save your money and rent it, 5 days is plenty of time to complete this game."
2,Unsatisfied,"I saw Hunter on the shelf and thought it would be an interesting game to play. To my complete dissappointment, I learned otherwise. You simple kill a constant stream on zombies until you reach the ""boss"". The zombies keep coming. You circle, shoot, circle etc... Then move to the next area and repeat.Hunter does become more interesting toward the end, but by then it didn't matter to much for me. Hunter is generous on continues, so there is no worries there. I give it 2 stars for being on X-box.If you like none stop action . This could be the game for you."
4,Definitely worth a look . . .,"This is a classic hack-n-slash, kill everything in sight game. You can choose one of four characters (1-4 players), each with different abilities. Game play is fairly basic: survive, meet a few objectives, and beat the bosses. Hunter does a good job of showcasing the graphical features of the Xbox with lots of special effects, and has pretty good sound.On the down side, the game can get tedious with the sheer number of zombie monsters you have to kill. I would have liked to see more variety in the zombies -- you can only kill so many tattered-blue-jeans-denim-shirt zombies before you crave for one in a t-shirt.These complaints aside, the game is definitely worth a look."
3,Got Friends? Then maybe...,"This game offers up pretty decent graphics and gore. You get to choose from several different characters with different ""edges"". The controls are relatively simple to master but it is obvious (as you progress through the game) that you are gonna need some help. You quickly get outnumbered as you reach the higher levels and will get mauled very quickly, which becomes tedious and frustrating. As a one-player game, I give it two stars. Now, if you shift gears into a multi-player game, it's a whole different story. The game is actually fun and you don't feel like you're being set up to fail. As a multi-player game it gets four stars and is worth the effort. If you plan on mostly playing this one solo, look elsewhere."
4,Great Multi-Player Fun,"The previous reviews pretty much describe how the game is played.What I would like to add is this game is incredibly fun with a group a people. We rented Hunter for a week and played many long nights of fun and laughter.If you are into playing single player games, Hunter is nothing special.If you are having a few people over for the evening and like hack and slash action, this game is a must try.Given the recent drop in price, I would say this game is worth purchasing."
2,Rent it first,"I was less than thrilled with this game, going solely off of the White Wolf name without at least renting it first or investigating why the price tag dropped from $50 to $20 at most stores. What you get is a product with a workable storyline that is virtually unplayable. First off, you can't change your camera angle -- the game decides it for you. This makes it difficult to tell where the next hoard of zombies is coming from. Aiming is almost impossible, so you'll empty most of your ammo clips into the air before that hoard of zombies closes in on you. Finally, the characters respond sluggishly to the controls. I could have lived with the camera angle and poor aiming system if my aspiring Hunter wasn't lumbering around like a pregnant water-buffalo. Ultimately, a disappointing addition to my X-Box collection."
4,A Great Hunt(er),"I read reviews of Hunter the reckoning in different magazines and decided to buy the game and give it a shot. I am sure glad I did! Hunter is probabally my favorite Xbox game to come out this year. Single player is great. You pick one charachter to go through the game and try to kill the monsters that are all over. Where the game really shines though is multiplayer. You and 3 people can go at it together as a team, which adds all new strategy to the game. Great graphics combined with awesome gameplay make this a must buy!"
2,2 AND 1/2 STARS really...,"This game is a little repetitive and the company that publishes the Game (Interplay) wont release the codes. There is an invincibility code in the game it says as one of the tips but the...company wont release it. The only ones released was Max damage, All weapons, and STUPID Sound Check. And you can only do the all weapons code once every level... The only reason I suggest buying this game instead of renting is that it takes a while to beat unless you play for at least 6 HOURS A DAY EVERYDAY until its due back. It is worth checking out though."
2,Hunter: The BORING~~zzzz....,"I watched the long intro. which was interesting, but started playing and it is the same old hack/shoot run-around game. Not much excitement here. After defeating hundreds of zombies and tagging some blue icons, the tasks became repetitive. Rent the game before you purchase to see if this is what you are looking for."
5,so fun to play,"Hunter The Reckoning is a great game. Since I bought it I can't stop playing it! It's one of the best Xbox games out there. The graphics are really cool, and my buds really like the multiplayer feature as a team. Its a ton of fun to go around killing zombies, and freeing souls, especially when the camera angles make it even more challenging to complete the missions. Yeah, this is an awesome game, that needs to be in everyone's collection!"
2,"If you like borring, pointless, shooting games this is great",I got borred of this game before I got done with the first level. All you do is shoot continuesly attacking monsters that get harder and harder to drop as you go on. The bosses are rediculously hard and the story line could have been thought up by a two year old ape. The graphics are alright and the gore is cool but thats about the extent of this games qualities. Rent the game don't waste your money!
2,"Boring, not worth the money","First of all, I really wanted to buy this game from the reviews it had been getting, but in the long run I am glad I didn't. I had read all the reviews and previews and thought this would be like ""resident evil."" However, after renting it, I was truly dissapointed and would not recommend this game other than a rental. This game is ultra hard, even for really experienced gamers. If you don't have at least three players, it is almost impossible. Forget about just doing single player, you just won't last. Second, it's very boring. The whole game is just cutting up zombies and weird creatures over and over again. It really gets old. The story itself seems to have good thought behind it, but please don't spend your money on this game. Give it rental, because that's all it's worth."
2,Falls short,"Its too bad. I was actually pretty excited about this game initially. Why not? It has a pretty intriguing story, admirable spooky, misty graphics, and a variety of cool playable characters. So why is this game such a dissapointment?There is no stategy or gamemanship required, whatsoever! To make it through the entire game (which I did) requires nothing more than constant movement of your character and a quick (and strong) trigger finger. This is more of an arcade-style game of the ""Space Invaders"" genre. Hordes of bad dudes constantly chase your character and you shoot them until your finger falls off. Its fun for the first hour or two and thats it."
5,ONE OF X-BOX'S BEST,"I wen to hollywood video this past weekend and i was looking for a cool and challenging game my buddies and I could play, well i came across Hunter. I was curious to what it was about and everything cuz i ad never seen a commercial or anything about it so i brang it home, and the game is the best. I enjoyed it so muc i wen out and bought it the next day."
4,A very fun game.,"It is somewhat hard, no codes. But it one of the most fun games on the x-box since Halo, and it will compete with Brute force in my book for the # 1 spot.But if you are weak at heart you might want to ster clear of it, due to the grusome, bloody....... fun! This game exels in the x-box's prosseser from a train staion to the sewers, the blood looks real and the dismembering is awesome!!"
4,Great Game,"Hi, would have given Hunter 4.5 stars. Can't seem to do it however. I bought Hunter based on reviews at various game sites. It is the only other Xbox game that I own, the other being Rally Sport. I love Hunter. I thought it might just be an OK game based on some opinions I read but, it certainly comes down to choice. I played with all the characters to start off and ended up with Avenger as my first character to use to get through the game. I'm not done yet but, close. The other reviews here cover the game well enough so I just want to say a little about why it's a great game for me. I play Xbox about once a week. Thats all I have time for. I like a fun, challenging game that I can play for awhile then put aside until next time. Hunter is good for that. It will last me a long time and I look forward to playing it after a week. I recommend it."
4,"Good game - Not the best, though","I guess I was expecting more of a true first person shooter (i.e. Halo). It's a cool game, with ambling creatures of horror, but it's more like Diablo, a bird's eye view of the action. I'm not knocking it, but you may want to rent it before buying. It has a very arcade type of feel."
2,Good graphics,But the game is so hard. There are no difficulty settings so if you aren't a 11 year old with a no job.. You might get frustrated.
5,A joy to read!,"I saw this book in Town and Country magazine and looked it up on Amazon and bought it. I also found (at a thrift store) her other book ""My Favorite Things"" I just LOVED them both. As a home lover I can't get enough of books that are truly passionate about the homes we live in. Imo, a house is NOT a home unless you put your heart and soul into it and Ms. Rogers did. Her style is admirable and her views are timeless. These 2 books are to be devoured...lol...not just read. Enjoy!"
3,Just goes to show...you need to learn the alphabet too,"This is a essential book to have in your library if you're going to study the Arabic language in any great depth; however, it probably is not of much use to people who only want to get a quick crash course to the language. My advice to you language learners: You need to master the alphabet to truly master conjugating the verbs.(This advice also applies for Hiragana, Cyrillic, etc.)Considering what else is available on the market, this is a good reference tool."
4,A Good Reference for Arabic Verbs,"Learning the science of conjugating in Arabic is no easy task; so it is a wonder to have books like these to ease the path to learning Arabic verbs. I did, though, have some problems with it. The biggest I had with the book was that examples were not given after the verb, showing how it could be used in different contexts (since so many Arabic verbs can have multiple meanings depending on the context). My second problem was the lack of an index to look up a verb. My last problem is that there was no overview of Arabic verbs, its place in sentences, how to conjugate, etc. Overall, it is a good resource to have."
1,Very limited,I agree with most of the other reviewers - this book is of limited use and a disappointment. It gives detailed conjugation of representative verbs but no list of other verbs which follow the representative patterns. It assumes you have the Wehr Dictionary handy in order to figure it all out. It was obviously intended for specialist use - if so why promote it so widely. Oh yeah - caveat emptor: it also has errors. A much more useful and cheaper book is Arabic Verbs and Essential Grammar by John Mace who packs a wealth of information into a small volume.
2,Julia Brown's review of 201 Arabic Verbs,I was dissapointed with this book because I was expecting the verbs to be written in Arabic (which they are) but also that the verbs be written as they are pronounced in English. This book is not usefull to people who do not know how to read in Arabic.
4,"If you understood how to use it, you would have liked it...","One common thread unites those who did not like the book...they did not figure out that the paradigms shown (the 201 actual verbs conjugated) are to be used by referencing the index in the back to find the type of verb you want to conjugate and then looking at the paradigm it references. The meaning that the book gives is not important since many verbs have many meanings (often) anyway. Context and your dictionary is always the source of meanings. You can find the correct way to conjugate almost any verb by identifying its type in the back and referencing it's model paradigm. If you know how to do this, this book CAN be helful for beginners. Intermediate and advanced students often have a sense of how conjugations go and after a while don't need a tool to tell them. Those who understand how to use the book, give it good reviews."
3,"Okay, but not great...","I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is missing something. I found that some of the most commonly used verbs seemed to be missing. Unfortunately, I haven't found another book of it's kind that is more complete, so this one will have to do unless something better comes along."
3,Mixed,"Plus side: detailed descriptions and good info on locations of these churches for those who want to go out and see them. The 5 star rating system is also useful.Down side: I was not impressed by the photos. Far too many are of interiors for my taste, and many of the exteriors are too close up to depict the churches in their full grandeur."
3,A good historico-geographic travelogue.,"The historical background is good; very helpful as a travelogue. Author should have lessen his personal architectural taste. Splendid photos, specially the details. Good general information; but not so helpful for my purpose of getting ideas in designing small chapels."
5,I got what i waited for.,"Ive been waiting for this cd for a year now. I had some of the songs on mp3 and heard some in the concert, and now i finally have it. I loved it personally. It was great. It had the glo theme on it, but it was different. Delirious always changes. Its great. I recommend this cd. Its mixed better than audio lessenover, more features...and its delirious, one of the best bands ever. Buy it. It rocks."
2,A poor job,"I'm a delirious fan and have all of their previous CDs, however I have to say that this CD is a bit of a disappointment and I don't listen to it often.Many of the songs are weak in the melody department - a strength of previous Delirious offerings. Martin Smith sounds like he is trying to channel Radiohead at times and ultimately fails in my opinion. The focus of the songs on this CD seems to have shifted away from outright Christian themes to more general life themes of love and loss. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to keep them stuck in the Christian ghetto with everyone else, I just think that tackling more general themes leaves them with a less distinctive voice than they had previously.If you are a die-hard fan like me then you'll buy this CD anyway. If not, steer clear of this particular offering........"
2,Disappointing.,"I was disappointed with this record. I guess at some point the standard's got to fall, but the last two have been so good, they have stayed fresh and gone new places when I wasn't sure there were new places to go... But this one falls apart. It bows to radio like King of Fools did, but King of Fools had Deeper and Sanctify and King or Cripple and What a Friend I've Found... enough quality to forgive its overall blase sound. This record has two or three decent songs, no sparklers, and the rest is just boring. I guess that makes it their worst."
3,delirious in the mainstream,"Unfortunately, most of the bad reviews have been because people don't understand the type of delirious that put this album out. Though not up to speed with King of Fools and Glo, Touch is still very addicting. The sound is much different than Glo and King of Fools and more along the lines of Mezzamorphis, which has more of a UK mainstream sound. The limited edition cd package makes the purchase all the more worth it, with great live performances and a bonus live performance of ""There is a Light"" which made me shed a tear the first time I heard it. So, if you are looking for the praise music delirious usually puts out, this isn't your cup of tea. But if you are a diehard delirious addict such as myself, don't even hesitate(you probably already have it, tho.)LOOK FOR THE NEW DELIRIOUS? ALBUM COMING SOON! ALSO, CHECK OUT THEIR NEW SINGLE ""MAJESTY"" AT MP3.COM (due out october 1.)"
5,Delirious?'s most accessible album,"Having firmly planted themselves as leaders of the modern worship movement with classics such as ""I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever"", Delirious? took a risky turn when they released ""Touch"" and its UK counterpart ""Audio Lessenover"". For fans who were waiting to see what the band had in store next after the success of ""Glo"", some might have been disappointed. ""Touch"" did not contain the same heart-pounding, euphoric worship anthems such as ""My Glorious"". This album contained catchy, imaginative alternative rock songs. CCM listeners could point to the title track and several other songs as evidence of a declaration of faith, but many of the lyrics could be interpreted as being addressed to God or to their love. The Christianity was still there, but it was subtle, thus making this Delirious?'s most radio-friendly album, particularly songs such as ""Show Me Heaven"", ""Take Me Away"", and the instantly catchy ""Waiting For The Summer""."
4,A tiny gem.,"Despite its extremely short length, this is a really fun book. Each of its 83 pages contains a single notable phrase (probably) found scribbled on a bathroom wall. Some are merely puzzling, some profound, and some beyond hysterical. Many would be great on a t-shirt. Personally, I'd love to have a t-shirt that said ""Nuke a gay whale for Jesus."" Maybe it's just me. Or perhaps ""Some mornings it just doesn't seem worth it to gnaw through the leather straps."" Or, more benignly, ""Time flies like the wind. Fruit flies like bananas."" While in college, I had a white-board on my door, and each morning, I would copy one page of this book onto the door. I got used to hearing my hallmates laughing outside my door pretty much every day.My one wish is that the book were a bit longer."
4,lots of fun,"The droids comics, are often times irreverant and funny, and i like this. i give this book 4 stars because, it is a little 2 silly, for most tastes. but the story does fit into star wars contiunity so far, so it is a good read if you wanted to know more about what the droids were doing between episode 3?, and episode 4."
3,The follow up to Kalarba Adventures,"The is a review of the Dark horse TPB that collects issues 1 to 4 of Star Wars ' Droids ' Rebellion. Unlike its nearly 200 page predecessor, this is a 112 page TPB. I am reviewing ISBN 1569712247 published in Jan. 1997.This comic is divided into 4 chapters and is a step down from The Kalarba Adventures in terms of quality of production. The paper and inking are good, but of lesser quality. The artwork is of comic strip style, but the inking is very good. The stories are fun but the lack of awesome light saber fights could not keep my sons interest. My youngest, a daughter, did like the stories. I give this 3 stars because there are few choices in the marketplace that combine a politically neutral story with pictures."
4,The Droids are coming! The Droids are coming!,"This is an incredibly fun romp through the Star Wars Universe from the viewpoint of C-3P0 and R2-D2 and other droids (as was originally intended anyway). Its very fun to see as the humans and aliens fade into the background bringing the mechanical beings to the forefront.The art in this is beautiful: full of detail while keeping a slightly cartoony feel to emphasize the fun tone of the whole story. The comic writing matches equally well to bring you a story of the droids as you would never have imagined before.C3-P0 as the charismatic leader of a revolution, reaching untold ""delusions of grandeur"" as he leads his fellow droids into battle! The ""gonk"" droid, tortured mercilessly by idiot humans, getting his eventual revenge. These and many others are great scenes that bring the world of the Droids of Star Wars into the light, onto the comic pages, and into our hearts."
4,Not Craig's Brother,"I have been a big fan of Craig's brother (Adam and Andy's former band) and especially appreciated Andy's songwriting with CB, and as such I have found Too Bad Eugene a lot different, which I guess is their aim, so that is good... Just as the guitar in CB was a highlight so too is it in this album."
5,The Best School Year Ever,"I thought that this was a great book. It had a lot of comedy in it. In the summer I will probably read this book again. Although it was a little confusing ,it was still a great book. I thought it was funny when the Herdmans charged 25 cents to see Howard ,the amazing baby! It was a great book.I would recommend this book to anyone of the ages of 9-12. If you like a book with lots of commedy this book is for you.by Macy"
2,funny for kids who laugh easily,"This book has some funny in it,but not as much as you think.If you laugh easily,this is the book for you.The smart comments are funny though.Here`s one,this kids head was stuck in a bikerack this really cheered him up ""their gonna cut your ears off""said a Herdmen.This book wasn't that bad."
3,Funny HeIrdmans Dull Background,"I liked this book,I would recommend this book to kids older than eight.I liked how the Herdmans were smart-allecks.It also was very confusing.The Herdmans were funny but the rest of the story was dull!Sorry if that hurts you.by:DREW"
3,best school year ever,"I thought that the book was ok. My favorite part was when sombody got their head stuck in a bike rack. I didnt like the first chapter because it was so long and had so much information,like the tattoed baby. This book was OK."
4,The Best Book Ever!?,"I would give the book four stars because the herdman's were involved in a lot of things together.It could of had a few minor adjustments though.One adjustment that could have been made is that Ollie and Ralph have helped Imogene put magic marker on his head.Also they could of had mentioned Imogene Herdman a little less.In my opinion,I think the book was well written and was a good sounding book!Also, when you read this book, I hope you like it a lot!"
2,The Best School Year ever,this was good for what I got. It seemed to be about 20 pages. I was in the halloween book and it jumped to this one. maybe a Kindle issue
3,T he 6 crazy herdmens,"If you are looking to read a funny book you should read this book.There are six kids that smoke and love to set things on fire.Also,they love to get people scared of thing like bus number six - theysaid it had big bugs on it!This really scared people when there was really nothing wrong with the bus.So if you are looking for a funny book you should read this book.t"
4,The best school year ever,"This book is about a family that is very bad and very sneaky. Their name is the Herdmans. They lie and steal. No one in town likes them. And no one in town wants to be with them. Because you never now what they will do to you. Their town just opened a new Landry mat. They hoped that the Herdmans don't come. Because is they do the will probably just ruin it. But shire enough, they came. And they came to wash their cat in the mashings. But all they did was ruin the whole store. And now there is a mad cat running all over the town. There school is planning to have a play with a brunch at the end of it, but they are worried about the Herdmans. They might steel all the food and ruin the whole play. What will they do next?This book was pretty good it is not the best book in the world. I have read better. But, I liked it."
5,The Funniest Book I've Ever Read!,"Beth said it was her best school year ever, but it was her worst school year ever.She was good, but the Herdman's kids were bad.The Herdman's were a family with 6 kids, and they were always getting into trouble.This was the funniest book I ever read. In one part,the Herdman's stole a baby named Howard and put marker on his head. But my favorite part was when Eugene,a little first grader, was smashing walnuts on his head because Gladys made him do it for the school talent show. I think you should read this book. It is the best book I have ever read."
3,The Best School Year Ever,fictionIn the Herdman family there were six children and no one liked them and they were all very distructive. one student named Brenda had to write a class assigment about a Herdman. It took her all year to find the perfect compliment.What I liked most about the was how funny the Herdmans were.I didn't like a girl named Alice because she was a brat.My favorite character was Imogene because I thought the things she did were funny such asputting the cat in the washing to clean itpg.113 Brenda giving compliments about herself.I had to come up with compliments for my teachers on teachers dayI would say the book is entertaining and funnyMy strongest reason for recominding this book is it keeps the reader interested the whole book
3,The Bad Herdmans,"If you are looking for a funny book,then get the Best School Year ever. It is about a family called the Herdmans. They always get in fights and in trouble, they smoke cigars and set things on fire. One of the funnies chapters was when the Herdmans put their cat in the washing machine. the cat was a mess with its hair sticking straight up. By Haley"
3,T he Awful Herdmans By: Mia,"If anything goes wrong in Woodrow Wilson Elementary there's always a Herdman behind it. One day the Herdmans decided they were going to wash there cat in a wash in a washing machine. They were trying to wash there cat at a knew laundromat. They ended up wrecking the laundromat instead of cleaning there cat. If you want to know what funny things the Herdmans do next ,read this book!"
4,what about the book,I give this book The Best School Ever a 4 star rating. I give this book a 4 star because it skipped around and I could not follow it good but the rest was good. I thought it was funny when a boy got his head stuck. That is why I give this book a 4 star rating. by:zach
2,How About the Best School Year Ever,"I didn't really like this book because I didn't think it wasvery funny.Althogh,I would recommend this book to someone who likes to read about six trouble makers and their troublesome family.The book was hard for me to understand.By:FRANK"
2,A Bit of a Snoozer.....,"The story about the young woman who was mauled to death by two dogs should have been a book I didn't want to put down however, the opposite happened. I didn't want to pick the book up. The story was told in a flat, boring way, repetitious and for me, it never took off. Some TC readers like more information than needed and some don't - I don't. I just want to read a well told story that holds my interest, lately it's been hard to find. This story has been told on quite a few TC show - check your listings and watch the story, you'll be better off."
1,Sleazy,"A big disapointment. I should have known after hearing Jones being interviewed on NPR. She came off as self-promoting and sensationalistic. I had hoped that the book would be better. It isn't. Her prose is sterile and overly focuses on direct quotations where a summary would do fine. Beyond that it reads like a literary version of the Jerry Springer show. It's no wonder that none of Diane Whipple's friends or family members would cooperate with Jones. They probably smelled her coming a mile away. Reading Red Zone is something akin to passing by a an accident on the highway and gazing at the carnage as you pass by, it makes you feel sleazy for having done so. Clearly Jones is a woman with no shame."
1,"Questionable book, Questionable author","Save your money. This book was not well researched and gives the wrong impression about the Presa. Often, Ms Jones gives the impression it is the breed itself that is the risk. Humans create bad dogs - regardless of the breed.To capitalize on a tragedy such as this with the poor resources used makes the Whipple case all the sadder. Allow those close to her to get on with their lives.I would not recommend this book at all - especially because the proceeds are going straight to lining an author's pockets."
5,Red Zone,I could not put this book down! I could not wait to get home to read further. This true story was twisted beyond your imagination. Nigthmares are in your future after reading this.
4,worth the money,"As a person who is a fan of Miss Jones works, I highy recommend Red Zone. It is my favorite book that she has written to date. Jones takes a personal interest in the violent death of Diane Whipple. I found this account about Whipple's neighbours, Robert Noel and Marjorie Knoller to be fascinating, and beyond belief. Their twisted minds are revealed in a way that has never been covered by any other media outlet in this way. It was totally worth the money for me to learn the real truth behind the scenes."
1,"Tripe, dreck, swill, slop","While it's true that this book gives more information than was provided by the media, it is so slathered with Ms. Jones' personal opinions and musings that it is hard to take seriously. A true journalist would have been a better choice for a story as intriguing and important as this. Instead, Ms. Jones seems to be more concerned with dropping the names of all the important San Francisco people she met: ex-Mayor Willie Brown, current Mayor Gavin Newsom and his lingerie model wife, Kimberley. Real journalists at least attempt to leave their own feelings out of their work, and report events in an objective way. Ms. Jones is clearly incapable. This book should have been called ""All About Aphrodite: The San Francisco Years."" The book cover photograph of her alone is worth a thousand words (most of them unflattering.) If you must buy this book, buy it used....."
1,"national enquirer-esque, badly written","How can this woman stand to prophet from such an awful event? Are any proceeds being donated to the Diane Whipple Foundation? There is nothing new in this book that wasn't already written about in the newspapers. The author devotes her whole ""career"" to capitalizing on other people's tragedies. Disgraceful, self-serving trash."
3,Red Zone,"I cried when I read this book.This was an ""accident"" that took the life of Ms.Whipple.And of course, it was very sad that such a event occured. But at the same time, many people are attacked and even killed almost daily in this country by animals.Please. Let us not forget,Shawn Jones,the little black child, who was attacked by three ""poorly kept 'dogs while riding his new two wheels. This case never went to court.So I guess he does not matter! Ms.Jones could have spoken about him in referance to this case. All people matter in the eyes of God!Sadly,we may never know what caused Bane to attack."
1,This book might make you feel worse!,"I bought this book along with 2 others. This book is not for people who's anxiety stems from fear of medical conditions, ect. More than half of this books goes into detail about medical conditions relating to every part of the body. That is defininately not what I needed to hear, especially with my fears. I couldn't even finish reading the book because it made me so nervous. Why on earth would this author go into such detail for more than half the book on conditions that you might have that might not be caused by anxiety but rather some disease. Instead of calming you about the bodily symtoms you have, as they are normal in axiety, he goes into detail about hear disease, strokes, etc. No thank you. Horrible Book! Doesn't help at all...it makes things worse."
2,Back to the research,The recommendation to reduce anxiety and worry by thought stopping have been found untherapeutic in recent studies. This book needs to be updated.
4,dont' panic,"a progressive, experiential treatment of a number of panic disorders, utilizing treatment regimens that sound like they are effective while supporting ones ability to heal itself, not relying or relying at a minimum, 'crutches'. the author speaks from field experience."
4,Great Tool for Panic Attacls,"As a short time sufferer of Panic Attacks, this is the second book I have read regarding them. I have come to appreciate his description of what happens to our bodies during a panic attack and his solutions of breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. This is a great source for information on Panic Attacks. And NO you are not crazy!..."
1,Made me Nervous!,"I have been suffering from panic and anxiety since I was 4 years old. This book was recommended by my therapist, and I found it tremendously panic-inducing! It's a little dense, and there's a very thick section in the beginning which just describes panic over and over and over again... !!!!!Sometimes, I've found that reviewing the symptoms of panic can actually get me to calm down. I realize that these are just symptoms, and they'll go away when I can calm down. Not so with this book. It makes me too nervous, and I have to put it down. I've never been able to read more than a few pages without feeling sick.It's utterly useless, in my opinion, to those it's trying to help. May be a good read for the spouse or partner of a suffering person. Have someone read it and give you the information!"
3,"First part bad, the second one is excellent","The first part of this book is very bad. If I bougth this book is because I know for sure I suffer panic attack, so the discribe (at a detail) all other disease make me very scare of it. So discard the first part. The second part is excellent with case studies, and exercises to do, the philosofy of observer are very wise. I think this book is for two different audience, but if I bougth a book I don't waste my money."
1,all filler.,"this book is about 75% filler. there are many parts where it will say something like ""before we learn the technique of controlled breathing, lets reflect on something"". then you gotta read 3 pages of non-sense before actually learning what the chapter was meant to teach. also, the book is very boring, uses huge medical words normal people don't know, and is just not helpful. lets face it, if your reading it it's cause you got some loose screws in your head. your either anxious which comes with depression most of the time and your stressed out. most people in that situation don't want to sit and read a boring book that's written like a technical manual on routine maintenance. also, there are a lot of religious references. science and religion should not be mixed. Psychology is the scientific study of human (or animal) mental functions and behaviors. if your religious... great... pray for less anxiety. if your not, find a more interesting book."
1,Lame and wordy,"This book is about as easy to swallow as two valiums without any water. But once you do manage to digest a couple of chapters, it should make you just as sleepy. If you're having panic attacks, this book is of no help as you can't concentrate when you're having them in order to follow its mundane directions -- as anyone who has them will tell you. See a doctor and forget this tripe."
5,Best Panic Disorder book I have ever read.,"This book, which I have had since 1986, had more impact on my life than anything else I have ever read about Panic Disorder. Although the whole book is tremendously helpful, Chapter 11 ""The Breath of Life"" made the most difference to me. I was a chronic hyperventilator, which brought on many of my attacks. Understanding the effect that hyperventilation had on my body then mastering the correct beathing technique has made my life much easier. I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from any kind of PD or Agoraphobia."
5,If you want help helping yourself this book is for you...,"This is an interesting and informative book for those suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. If you or someone close to you suffers from panic and anxiety, and you are ready for a change, buy a couple of copies of this book. I have suffered from anxiety my whole life, I bought this book, read it and then bought a copy for my mother. It can help you change the attitudes with which you deal with your anxiety (or your anxious loved one) and show you the road to recovery. I have spent lots of money on phobia ""cures"". This book is not expensive AND it offers a plan that works. Can't beat that!"
4,Here's to you...,"This is a cool little guide for a weekend in the Big Apple. Designed for travelers with two days to burn, it shows you the highlights through walking tours. A small map is included, providing a quick overview of New York's layout. The city is broken down into districts (ie. SoHo & Greenwich Village, Chinatown and East Village) with a selection of restaurants, stores, and attractions for each one. All in all, a good deal. One note of caution however: this guide is the same size as a credit card, but the covers are magnets. So don't put this near any of your credit cards or computer disks. It could do a number on your Visa!"
2,outdated???,"It certainly is a cute little book, very portable. The maps are nice and I can just imagine myself walking down the street and whipping out the book to find a cozy little bar in Chelsea.However, the book it is very out of date. Here is an example excerpt ""WHERE TO START DAY 2: World Trade Center. The twin towers practically define the lower Manhattan skyline.....""If it still has info about the WTC, then perhaps the other info is also not quite up-to-date?"
5,JR Watson is a national treasure,"Jr Watson is a national treasure. A musical genius- guitar legend. He is able to do anything and does. He mixes old, new, odd and blues standards . It is always worth your money. If i were going to be on a deserted island and could only choose one artist's cd's to bring with me it with be all of my Jr Watson cd's. You won't be disappointed by him ever."
2,"Dear God, take away his guitar","I loved his music, and I loved his singing. Lots of soul. But Dear God... Take away his Guitar. Case in point, On calls everybody sweetheart but me, it's is the worst Guitar work I have ever heard, If it was live I would go up to the stage and grab his guitar and say ""Give me that, You are going to hurt yourself."" Buy it if for nothing else to laugh and show your friends what Bad Blues is all about."
5,Worms,"This is a great, and complex game that i, 14, and my 17 yr. brother can play as well. As of plot, theres not much, but there is a ton of strategy. Now personally, i love RPGs (roleplaying games) like baldurs gate and icewind dale, but MY computer, in my room doesnt allow them so i decided to get something more basic. let me tell you worms isnt basic its an in depth game play for almost all ages, excepy youngster. You play as 8 worms, for example you start, or the other team does, every worm at a time, off and on. you can use things like uzis, bazookas, longbows, kamakazis, teleports, and much more. the point is to kill the opponents worms, or knock them off into the water, ultimately killing them as well. Oh, and by the way single player kicks because the computer is hard to beat.PLease say this was a helpful review!"
3,Lets Say... Different,"to tell you the truth this is game does not look like a worms game but its still look ok not that good. The idea of the game look extrimly differtent then all the other worms games. I dont think i will buyed but one thing is for sure i will rented and then i will see if its good or not, if its good then i will buyed because i love the idea of game boy advance. One thing its for sure the game of worms world party looks much... much better then this game."
4,Clint on The Rock,"Clint Eastwood plays Frank Morris, who along with John and Clarence Anglin escaped from ""The Rock"" in 1962. Morris has a genius I.Q. and has escaped many a prison, but the warden (Patrick McGoohan) underestimates him. Since we're never told what Morris is in prison for, we can't really dislike him, so naturally we root for him to successfully escape. Cold reality of prison life is vivid throughout. Frequent Eastwood director Don Siegal turns in another top notch job. The fact that we know how this will end does little to diminish excitement."
5,Clint Eastwood! Need I say more?,"The vast majority of Eastwood movies are great and what is there to not like about this one? Clint is great, as usual, and you find yourself loving every minute he gets over on ""the man."" Once again a ""Man's Man."" Love the scene where he punches out a fellow con who wants to kill him. If you love Dirty Harry or the Eiger Sanction you will love this one also."
4,AWSOME,Loved it to pieces; one of my ultimate fave movies ! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is that it has no bonus features or documentary stuff..but oh well. BUY IT NOW !
3,"OK, good Clint, but slow","Slow-moving prison film with Eastwood as Frank Morris, a convict transferred to the hellish Alcatraz from an Atlanta prison. Morris, after standing up to the local prison rapist-to-be, starts to look for a way out. No one had ever escaped alive from Alcatraz, but he and several cohorts try to foil the warden and authorities. The movie is by-the-numbers and plods along, but the authentic locations and Eastwood's force of a personality lift it a little bit."
1,Buyer Beware,"Unless you know what Region 2 is the product is useless in the US. Region 2 videos are only playable on DVD players for Europe. I guess I learned something at my expenseThe company did let us return it but less the shipping and handling because they said it is clearly stated Region 2. What a rip off on the postage, plus the time to send it back etc!My complaint is why would anyone sell something is the US that cannot be used in the US!"
1,Dont buy,This disc would not play. I think it was made for some asian machine. It said it wouldn't play on any american device.
1,I didn't know what I was buying?,"My son is crazy about everything ""Alcatraz."" He wanted to see this movie badly, but it wasn't available through Netflix or at our local Blockbuster, so I thought I'd bite the bullet and purchase a dvd. When I went onto the Amazon site, it appeared I could rent it/stream it for a couple of bucks, or purchase the movie for 10.00. I opted to buy the movie, was charged 10.00, and the movie was streamed? I was disappointed, thought I was getting a dvd, and had I known I would've opted for the chaper version. Not sure I'd purchase a movie from Amazon again..."
2,SLOW,I'm honestly at a loss for why this movie is getting such good reviews. The only reason I liked it is because I am facinated by Alcatraz. The movie doesn't get you involved with the characters and the plotline is weak. I can't really recommend this but it wasn't horrible.
3,Escape from Alcatraz,It is okay documentary. Very educational and very explanations . The way they explain the characters are very interesting and informational
5,Very Pleased w/Purchase,Have been looking for this movie for awhile...I'm very happy with this DVD. Delivery was quick and no problems with the DVD. Thanks and have a safe & Happy New Year.
3,Escape from alcatraz,"Its early Clint Eastwood. If anyone took a tour of Alcatraz they will appreciate it more, plus keep in mind its based on true events."
4,Clint,This movie is a classic and a def. slick performance by Clint Eastwood. A must see for a prison break fan.
1,DVD Region,"Be careful when purchasing a DVD over the internet. Unbeknownst to us, we were sold a DVD which could not be played in the U.S.A. Apparently the seller was well aware of this limitation, yet no alert was forwarded when it became clear the item was intended for use in the U.S.A. This is information which a common, ordinary person would not know. Be advised Region 2 is not for U.S.A."
1,escape from alcatraz,Sucked..format was wrong can't play on a any dvd player we have..wont purchase again..I'm annoyed by it..we planned a family nite to watch it but that was ruined
1,Can't view it !,DVD cannot be viewed on my DVD player. Tried all three DVD players in my house and also on my computer.Says illegal region...What does that mean?Wasted money. Can't even view the movie.Very unhappy!
2,Escape From Alcatraz DVD,A simple-minded and dated film about prison and prisoners. My suggestion is to watch American Me or Runaway Train to see a little more realism. The widescreen DVD is good.
4,Very good!,"Although not a 5 (hey, not every book can be perfect!) this is an engrossing story. I picked this one up without reading the other ""Velvet"" stories - and went out and bought all three of the others based on the strength of this one. Yes, both of the main characters are flawed - Raine really has some issues in this one, you don't get too see the funny, playful guy he is in the first one (I'm 1/2 through that now). And Alyx has her issues too - but they both grow throughout the book, and by the end you know that they've come to accept their own limitations, as well as the limitations of their relationship. I loved how Alyx charmed King Henry with song, achieving what all those warmongering men couldn't do!"
1,"Loved the others of the series, but this one is BLECH! *spoiler alert*","Terrible story line! I loved Raine in the other books as a gentle soul who was more understanding than his stubborn brothers. Then in this book, he becomes a sulky nasty wife-beater who neglects his whole family. Blech! The other stories in the series were much better. I also was not a fan of Alyx. Whine, whine, shout shout... The ""couple"" fighting overpowered this novel. I was actually hoping Brian Chatworth was Raine in the duel and that it would just be a tragic story that would tidy up in the next book."
3,"It was alright, but not as good as the others","The Velvet series is my favorite series of books I have ever read, however, this third one was kinda disappointing. I expected so much after reading the first two (Velvet Promise & Highland Velvet - which were great by the way) and then this one was not as good. Both Raine and Alyx both lack something as hero and heroine. I would still recommend this book if you are to continue with the series and on to the fourth one becuase it will make the fourth (Velvet Angel) easier to comprehend."
1,Not just a little dissappointed...,but hugely dissappointed! This book was just bad. I kept wishing it would end. Both main characters had such bad tempers it was rediculous. And a man who would put pride above his child isn't anyone worth loving. I didn't like it all. I've never read any of Jude's books before and now I don't plan to.
2,"alyx is too weak-spirited, not the right image for a heroine","jude deveraux is one of my favorite author but this book doesn't equal the rest of her works. i find that alyx doesn't have a strong sense of dignity. there was this scene in the forest when raine got really angry w/ alyx so he spanked her. after that, he didn't even sooth her tears but juz pushed her off his laps and said, and this is quoted, ""When you're through sulking, come back to the tent and i'll make love to you so passionately you'll forget who you are."" and alyx was so ready to forgive him and happily followed after him! i mean doesn't she have any pride??? he didn't even say he's sorry! i mean she's juz forgive him cauze he said the magic word, ""sex""! and raine always mad at her because he doesn't wait for an explaination of why she did all these things to help him! whenever he's mad, he just packed up and go and left his wife and daughter just like that!"
3,Rather disappointing book I would say...,"It was not that bad, but I have read 2 or 3 books of Jude Deveraux and loved them so I expected this to be a very good book too. Unfortunately, it was just an average book, good to read and pass your free time, but nothing to remember about it after it's finished. Alyx's transformation to a boy, ends very early and the only thing that keeps the story going after that, is Raine's jealousy (a very common theme). I loved the Taming and the Knight in Shining Armor, and this book had nothing to do with them. I would suggest readers to try other books of Jude Deveraux and forget this one...."
3,Okay but not the best,"I love all of Jude Devereaux's stories; however, this one left me rather cold. Raine is possibly the most stubborn, prideful man I've come across. To stay away from Alyx and his baby for over a year because of his pride does not say much for his behavior. I wonder how long he would have waited if Alyx had not sent the baby to him. He was so sweet in Velvet Promise and found fault with Gavin. In this story Raine had few good qualities."
3,Okay,"The telling of the story was good, and I love the way she still brings in all the other montgomery family into the story. The Romance of Alyx and Raine was beliveable, however, I enjoyed the story more than the Romance."
4,To a reader in Nashville Tenesee,"The Velvet books are in this order. The Velvet Promise, Highland Velvet, Velvet Song, and Velvet Angel. These books are okay but the heroines are slightly annoying in half of them the ones who I reallly like are Judith Montgomery and Brownyn McArran. Elizabeth is afraid of her own shadow. Alyx tends to balme the World for all her problems.Granted a few of her problems are other peoples fault but not all of them."
5,A Highland Love,This was another one of Jude Deveraux's books i could not put down. I have read all of her books and am on my last four with the montgomery series. Highland Velvet was a romantic tale with lots of laughs. You get so tied into their lives and how they feel. You begin to fall in love with Stephen Montgomery right away. Bronwyn is a strong female who is made to marry an Englishman whom she hates because they killed her father. Throughout the book even on the last page you are smiling about how sweet Stephen is and what he does for the woman he loves. This book I recommend to everyone who loves a wonderful romance novel.
4,A poorly made copy of the filmstyle of Nelson Freire,The film has interesting concert footage. She is difficult to understand because she does not complete her thoughts. I think she deserves a film about her life as she is a fabulous artist but a true film maker has to direct it an dedicate himself to the project.
5,Martha Argerich Evening Talks,"Fascinating conversation with a musical genius. Fabulous insider look at a rehearsal of the Schumann Piano Concerto. I treasure this DVD about an artist that heretofore has been very inaccessible.John McD. Wolff, MD"
4,Tamed tough men,"We got this book out of the library and it ended up being one of our favorites during its 2 week stint and I plan on buying it for my son for Christmas. Get over some of the gross humor (picking noses and such)- which i am sure older kids will find hysterical, and just enjoy this unique and strange and beautifully illustrated tale about 3 rough , tough men tamed by a little poodle!"
2,Couldn't the Wild West be tamed less crudely?,"I'm a little shocked that this book got such rave reviews, and that some are from teacher-types...as an elementary school librarian, I purchased this from a reputable vendor after reading SLJ's glowing review of it. But after seeing not 1, not 2, but 3 full page spreads of nose picking cowboys, I'm rethinking this purchase! I'm sorry, but our little guys and gals don't need any encouragement in this area! I know it's all in good fun, but I can pretty much guarantee that I would have plenty of parents who would be offended and/or upset that their child checked this out of his/her school library (and folks, I'm not at all a prude here, but I have to say I agree!). Cute story line, but the nose picking has to go. Not the sort of book I'd want my own children choosing, or receiving as a gift either."
5,A Fascinating and Engaging Book,"From National Review Online:An Unplanned Life, by George M. Elsey. The newly published reminiscences of the author's days as a Naval aide to FDR and speechwriter and advisor to President Truman. Now 87, Mr. Elsey spent many hours with Roosevelt in the White House Map Room, served as the president's personal witness to the invasion of Normandy, and decoded and delivered to Truman the first report of the mission over Hiroshima. The stories are fascinating and engagingly told - the product of careful note-taking, an undimmed memory, and a modest, gentlemanly character. --Matthew Scully"
4,"If you're overwhelmed by UML, this book whittles it down.","Other UML books tell you about the capabilities of UML. This book tells you how to use a subset of UML to complete a software project rapidly, and for that I give it a cautious recommendation.The fundamental philosophy, placing Use Cases at the center of the development process, is sound.The reader should excercise caution: Some aspects of this book (robustness analysis) are out of the mainstream and others are off the charts (the appendix on uses vs. extends is one volley in a larger 'religious war').If you're overwhelmed by UML and all its minutia, this book whittles it down--class diagrams, use cases, robustness diagrams, sequence diagrams--and presents a step by step development process."
1,Ditto this NOT being Unified Process,"I had to read this book for a class I took. Here is my interpretation of the purpose of this book:""I think the world should have used my ICONIX process! This UML stuff is inferior. I hate UML, but I will use it to sell my book.""Fortunately, the class also used Martin Fowler's great UML Distilled book. If you want to know about UML, get that one instead!"
2,The title is misleading,I expected this book to delve more into UML and use cases than it does. It really is a book about the ICONIX methodology. It only deals with UML and use cases at a high level.The robustness analysis is interesting and may help people who have trouble linking the user interface to the model.If you are looking for a book on the ICONIX methodology then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book on UML or use cases then this is not the right book.
5,This book presents a practical guide to implementing OOAD.,"This is a practical guide to implementing OOAD. The author effectively presents both the why and how of OOAD. This book will be valuable to ""newbies"" and organizations just starting to implement OOAD. The author is an expert on the subject and presents a balance of tutorial and example information. I would recommend that this book be purchased by any software development organization for the purpose of training new employees and initiating start-up projects."
4,"""I'm not growing, you're shrinking"" Amazing colossal man","It is a quasi musical starring Marlene Willis singing the Title Song: ""You're My Living Doll"".Just like the film ""Kong Island"" without a Kong, or ""She Gods of Shark reef"", the title of the film is a misnomer as no one is attacked by any puppet people.People start disappearing right off the bat. We already guessed the reason.Mr. Franz (John Hoyt) has a new secretary after being sure she had no relatives or close friends. This already sounds sinister. Soon the secretary introduced to the top salesman Bob (John Agar of ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" fame). What about bob? Soon they plan to marry and Bob also disappears.For some strange reason the secretary Sally (Joyce Meadows) suspects poor Mr. Franz just because he cannot stand to be left behind. We too suspect Franz, but that is crazy. Luckily no one else is crazy or we would not have this well made for the era black and white movie."
3,Scary book--not for kids,"Well, I bought this book for my sister in order to help her get over her fear of sharks. From some of the reviews, it looked like this book would debunk the myths and illustrate the shark as one of God's innocent creatures.In fact, she had nightmares the first night, after opening the book and turning directly to a picture of a man with 4,000 stitches. She was equally gripped by the even scarier-than-she-realized facts about the shark's hunting abilities.I have no doubts that this book is excellently written and truthful, but it is not for kids (or adults) who are still reeling from the legacy of Peter Benchley."
5,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Review,"I have owned all of the Calvin & Hobbes publications since Forever, and bought this particular one as a birthday gift for a little boy (of 11 years). How wonderful to be able to introduce him to the world of C&H; (and Mr. Watterson, of course)!He absolutely loves it. :)Everything that I have ever learned (of any r e a l import) has come as a result of reading Calvin & Hobbes. Has too! ;)"
5,LUV'D IT!!!!!,"Calvin And Hobbes...What A CLASSIC! It's hillarious, its clever, it's got everytihin! I bought this book as my first Calvin and Hobbes book years ago and I loved it immediatly! If im sad or upset, I just read this book and i'm happy again! IT's incredible! Watterson's commentary is an extra for this book and it's informative too. Also, this book has more strips than some of the other ones so buy this one! I hope this helped!"
4,It is a bit harsh,"Incredibly entertaining and worthwhile read, but I'd have to agree with one other person on this board: Watterson comes off a bit harsh. And much of the first section devoted to a licensing fight? Give us a break, Bill. You've been around for 10 years, gave us all something to look forward to in the morning paper, and you end your career moaning?Still, a great collection. Get it for that reason above all else."
3,good,"I allways say if you buy a.used book cover the cover bc you don't know where the book has been befor also the books are in great condion!!!!!!! And the book itself is hairis ""you know how ienstien got bad grades and became a genues well my grades are even worse"" I just love that quote"
4,Funny book,"I gave it that rating because the words were very long and hard to read, but other than that it is very funny and good. I would not read this book until I was older."
4,He's a little preachy,"Don't get me wrong, I love C&H. But Watterson is a bit preachy in this book. He tries to explain his rationale behind some of these comics and that's generally cool. But he has comments where he bashes other comics for being pretentions jerks while he comes across like basically a pretentious jerk. /shrug, it's still a good book with good comics. For me, it was a mix of eye-rolling at Watterson's comments vs. laughing at the comics."
5,Anniversary Book was great,It was bought for a gift to my brother as he is a Calvin fan ( like me ) from way back and he was thrilled at receiving the Anniversary Book. I would also like to say that Calvin's creator is an exceptionally clever man.
5,VERY FUNNY :),I love all of his books.Therem so funny. My whole family loves them. My cousin kinda reminds us of Calvin. My favorites are when Susie's in them. We have almost all of them we collect them all.
5,An Awesome Book!,"This Book is one of the most hillarious books I've ever read! And the hard cover is well worth it, so the book cover isn't ripped, or torn."
3,Bully Nerf Bars,"I received my chrome nerf bars quickly. The only thing wrong was that we had to drill a new hole in the steel bracket because the existing hole was way off and it wouldn't line up so we could attached the 2 parts together - only reason it doesn't get a 4 star. Otherwise, nice nerf bars. Just glad we had a drill bit that cut through steel."
4,Ney? Si!,"He's the Peter Allen of Brazil -- way over-the-top, kinda queeny, and a bit of a blue balladeer. His previous records always struck my ear as the kinda bouncy pop that Xuxa purveys across Latin America. But with ""Olhos de Farol"" Matogrosso stakes out fresh territory. Miséria No Japo, the lede off cut on this pretty satifsying, is a powerful rocker that suits his reedy bray. The title track could emerge to become one of late-MPB's great supper club ballads. Stand out track is the beautiful ""Poema,"" penned by Cazuza. Play spot the ""Free Bird"" lick on the other tracks."
4,Decent Herring,This is a decent can of herring although not my favorite. I found the herring a little on the soft side but still enjoy them. Got them on sale and the price was better than I could find anywhere else but I did have to buy 12 cans.
3,TOO LAZY TO LIST TITLES?,"You ask $62 for a bunch of retread pop that most people hated on the first go-round and then fail to list the titles. Nice work, Amazon. If you aren't already discouraged, Amazon UK is selling the same set for 14.98 GBP. Whatta joke!"
2,It needs a manual or game guide,Fun but hard to figure out how to get to earn chess sets. It needs an instruction manual
2,Disappointed,"After reading ""Ghost Soldiers"" I found ""Americana"" to be disappointing.""Americana"" is a collection of unrelated magazine articles, and they seem to have been written to accompany the photos of the magazine, instead of standing on their own. Some of the characters Sides writes about are interesting, but there's not much drama to the essays.Sides is an outstanding writer, as he proved with ""Ghost Soldiers"" -- a captivating and amazing story that was hard to put down. But be cautioned: ""Americana"" takes effort to get through!"
4,Pepe & Neném is a MUST !,"The moment I heard the CD my heart swept with joy. Coming from the street those two girls really show a very nice musical side of Brazil. I think the language itself makes this CD even more special. If you wanna lean back and enjoy brazilian music this CD is a must. I also would like to recommend the second CD ""Tudo bem"". It might be a little more commercial oriented and you are going to find some songs you have already heard before. But nevertheless - you gonna also like this one as it is different from the first publication. Peter (Switzerland)"
3,Want to get lost???,"This book was alright. It wasn't quite what one expected from the blurb, but it was enjoyable to read. I did get lost a few times because some it seemed to be disjointed. In the end, it was okay, but at the end I also wanted to scream WHAT HAPPENED!!"
4,Why I wrote this book,"I wrote this book because music video appears to present a certain aesthetic style that takes a fundamental aspect of human perception--synesthesia-- and expresses it in an interesting fashion. The book is, therefore, not only about music video, but the history of style and perception. It can be a bit dense at times (and I don't mean that in the best possible light), and I am ashamed to find that typos still exist even in this edited book--oh well. Those who read Dancing in the Distraction factory will find that this book begins where that book ends, although, don't blame the author of Distraction Factory for anything I say; we've never met, and the two book are very different."
4,Great Gift!,"I received this as a baby shower gift and absolutely loved it. When my husband and cousin assembled it, it resembled a true princess' bed. The website picture didn't do it justice. Layla loved her bassinet and we were sad when she outgrew it...she's now 7 months. But, she thoroughly enjoys her playpen. It gives her plenty of room to play and me the opportunity to do somethings around the house. She just recently started sleeping in her crib, but I still prefer the playpen.The only con is that there is no handle to the travel bag! Not sure what Graco was thinking about when they made it. But, other than that it's a definite winner, in me and Layla's book."
5,The BEST Pack N Play!,"This Pack N Play is the BEST! It's not only gorgeous, but it's SO nice and has every feature possible. The mattress is well padded and flexible and the organizer on one end is the perfect size. I am using this as a bassinet/changing table for my first floor and it's perfect. Worth every penny!"
1,Bad value for what you get...,"I purchased this DVD game for $24.99 and was very excited to play it. The game was pretty fun, however, after you play it 3 times you can just throw it in the trash! There are only 3 games on the whole entire disk, so once you've played them you know all the answers. Each game takes about 30 min., so you could easily play them all in one night. I was terribly dissappointed that the questions didn't change each time you play, it really makes the game useless for future playing. This game should cost about $5 or less for what you get!!"
3,expensive for only 3 once used games,"I very much enjoyed this game, however for $20 (depending where you purchase it), you only get 3 one time games. Once you've played the games, you can't play them again, because you know the answers. So, after playing the 3 (45 minutes each) games, we gave our DVD to friends who did not have the game. It's the gift that keeps on giving."
3,good party game...to pass around,"this game is alot of fun with a group of people who are familiar with ""recent"" movies. it moves fast and is definitely not boring. we had a blast. but...like other reviewers only 3 options to play and so, the game must be passed on. would be so great if only the questions could be shuffled around. was fun while it lasted..."
4,Fun Time for All Movie Go-ers!,This Disc and #2 - #4 are terrific ideas. Only two drawbacks I see. They seem to focus on some of the same movies from game to game and round to round. The second drawback is you can only play each disc once. Still a very fun game.
1,ZERO Replay Value,"The game, while fun, is so overshadowed by its inability to be replayed as to be totally overpriced. Five bucks would be a fair price for this one shot game. Spend a little more and get Scene It! If you don't want to use a board, do like we do, put the DVD in and keep hitting All Play. It's every bit as fun as Shout About Movies and its a better value."
3,"Very fun, but not worth the money!","Only buy this when the price goes down!!! My Aunt gave this to me because she played it and once you play all 3 rounds, the game is no good anymore. I really had fun with it, but now it's no good. I really wanted the rest of the series, but learned that the cheapest price was $20 (and at Target, btw!). $20 for this game is way too pricy if you ask me! When it goes under $10 I will buy the rest of the games! Rounds are definitely different and this game is a lot of fun to play with other movie loving people! I guess it is really worth is if you buy for a party function. It is fun though. Had a blast!!!"
2,Great game. but not worth the money,"The game really is clever, convenient and a lot of fun. However, there are only three identical games on the DVD. So, once you play them, it's over. you know the answers and can't play them again. when you pay close to $20 (and in some cases, plus shipping) it most definately is NOT worth the buy. it's good for an hour and a half of great fun. and it's over. I consider it a waste of money. We bought two editions, but decided not to open the second one and wilil just return it. I can't believe a company would even make a game that has that short of a life span. And, charge that much money. The concept is great. There is no game board, scoreing is within and it's extremely convenient. The games were great fun. just not enough on one dvd, for that money. We were highly disappointed."
3,Rip off!!!!,"This is actually a wonderful and fun!!!! game. The huge, major problem is that there are only 3 games to a disc, and once the games are played, the same people can't really play them again, because the questions are the same. It seems to me that there should be a way for the makers of this game to add more questions/clips and ""shuffle"" questions/clips on each game, so that you can play the disc over and over and over! (the game ""scene it?"" works this way. Plus the cost of each disc is exorbitant at $24.00+ To me you should get so much more for your money."
3,so-so,"I probably won't make many of these recipes. Some ingredients aren't easy to get, and some of the recipes just aren't appetizing. Another one to go on the shelf...."
5,Great Cookbook,It's a must for every kitchen. Lite meals with a flare will impress guests and are also great for the family.
3,It's fine,"The price was good and it works fine. I take it every night and it helps a little, which is more than most things I have tried. Minor anxiety/staying asleep issues and this is one way I try to help it."
2,It didnt do anything for me,"I had the same feeling as some others reviewers. I didnt feel anythig after I had finished taking two bottles Gaba. My intention was to fight aganist insomnia and the main problem is that I didnt feel anything and that's actually why I gave it two stars. If I had had any bad side effects, probably, I would give it 1 star."
3,Not as good...,"This product doesn't seem to be as effective as the equivalent Swanson product. I don't feel anything at all after taking the Source Naturals GABA, while the Swanson product has a noticeable calming effect."
3,there is a reason that it's not approved by the fda,"it is possible that this product could help promote balanced brain chemical levels. however, if you have a big enough imbalanced for you to be/or have been placed on ssris (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it will not take the place of such medications. if you are trying to ween yourself off of your medications, please talk to your doctor before doing so or taking any supplements that promote serotonin/dopamine reuptake. withdrawal can't be difficult if not dangerous if done incorrectly."
4,Puts me right to sleep.,"I started taking 2 GABA about 1 hour before bedtime. It put me right to sleep. However, it must have been too strong where I overslept and had a hard time getting up in the morning. I now take 1 pill. Much better. I don't wake up during the night. I get a very sound sleep. Itis awesome."
4,"Not exactly what I expected, but good product anyways","I was coming from the fat, heavy sound of the LesPaul, and wanted a little a more bright, sharp tone. I got what I wanted, but definitely sacrificed the heaviness and the incredible sustain that I had before.For an indie band, these might come in handy. For a heavy band, just forget about them."
5,"Top notch romantic novel by a gifted author -- a ""must read"" book!","Jessica Davis Stein is a gifted author who knows how to grab your emotions and hold on until the very last page. This is a must read for anyone who loves a deep, rich, satisfying romance. I've read the print book, listened to the audio book, and bought it as a gift for others. Enjoy!"
5,A Dream Of A Book,"Coyote Dream transports one between the magic of the desert southwest and the manmade canyons of New York. It is a Keeper that has a place of honor on my shelf of favorites. Now that it available electronically, I can have it with me as I travel.It made me want to book a flight westward and have some fry bread.There is a connection between Ben and Sarah that is so deep and so profound. Insurmountable just wasn't in their vocabulary.As a longtime collector of American Indian art, I found the artistic references to be inspired.The cooking scenes were mouthwatering in more ways than one.The group dynamic of the coyote pack and the cultural cohesiveness of the tribe when searching for one of their own were interesting parallels.It is simply a brilliant work. It spoke to my heart in so many ways.Gypsy"
3,"A little sappy, but a quick and entertaining read.","We read this book in our book discussion group with mixed reviews. The book is somewhat predictable and includes most any social issue you can think of - Jewish girl loves American Indian and gives up successful Jewish boyfriend; child molestation; secret affair of parent; holocaust, etc. etc."
3,Coyote Dream,I have both the original CD and the book. This is my all time favorite romance book. I have read and listened to both so many times I pretty much know them by heart. I was somewhat disappointed in all the changes that are in the ebook. The timeline was confusing in the originals but is even more so in the ebook. If purchasing I would go with the original book or original cd.
5,Coyote Dream,"""Coyote Dream"" is my all time favorite book. It is a true love story. I first listened to the book on CD from the library and loved it so much I purchased a copy of the book and the book on CD. Ben and Sarah's story is both heart wretching and heart warming. Ms. Davis Stein's details into both cultures so you feel that you are a part of them. I look forward to her next book."
5,Music that splashes with bright colors,"This collection is the fusing of the two commercially released Flock albums. The first album, ""The Flock"" is one of the most unique rock-based albums of all time. That's where the five stars come from. My review of this album, listed under the title ""The Flock"", gives a song-by-song description of what makes this music great.The second album ""Dinosaur Swamps"" is new to me. I own a vinyl copy that I found last year in a used record shop, and being familiar with ""The Flock"" and never having never heard this before I was quite excited to get it, but ultimately disappointed. I have to admit I should give it another listen or two to give it a fair shot, but my impression is that this was one of those bands that just had one good album in them, and this wasn't it.So I recommend ""The Flock"", but you can't go wrong plunking down a few extra bucks and getting this combined collection."
2,que decepción,"esto es un engaño, yo había comprado un par de color blanco y otro par de color azul pero el vendedor envió los dos pares de zapatos de color blanco! ademas dudo que sean originales puesto que el material se ve de baja calidad."

3,Cool,"I've had this movie for years. My parents called it ""Alice in Jeans"" because of the discussion about jeans with the White Queen at the start. It didn't stick to the story very well, I can say, but it was entertaining for a little girl such as the little girl I was. I especially liked the reference to Easter Island's heads. I can't say I really liked the movie much, because I didn't like Alice much, or any of the characters apart from the littlest monster (can't remember name). I found Alice kind of babyish, always saying ""I want to be a queen"" over and over. I did love Square Two and the scene on the train with the paper man and the horse and etc."
1,Do not buy it!,"Connect3D is not a normal company, it is a fraud company. And officially they are out of business, their phones are not answering. You will NEVER get any support from them, they will never honor any commitments. Make a search online ""Connect3d rebates"" - and you will easily find the story. There is a lawsuit filed against them, do not add your name to the names of people that were already fooled by Connect3d."
4,my love affair with trains,this is an excellent CD if you like old train whistles you will love this CD it's some of Merle haggard at his best
4,GE 56789 Smart Home Wireless Window Alarm,"Simple, easy to install. I like the fact that you can set it to either just chirp once or put it on full alarm. The alarm sound it makes is very, very loud, so should be an effective warning or deterrent. I've had them on my windows now for a month, and they're still stuck there just fine. The only thing I don't like is that they take 4 ""button"" type batteries, which can add up cost-wise to replace. That's my only criticism."
5,Home Alarm System,I am planning to move to an apartment in the city and wanted a way to feel safer. Although this alarm is advertised in homes it works just as well in my apartment. The chime lets me know when guest have entered during a party and at night I know that I will hear the alarm should a door or window be opened. It is pretty inexpensive as well.
2,Can't get it to work,"The curve of the doorway makes it impossible for this to work correctly. Wish I could say better, but if you have a curve in your doorway, don't get this."
2,On-off switch,"If you are looking for window alarms that will pass your inspection for pool safety code, this alarm is not what you want, due to the on/off switch."
5,GE56789 window/door alarm is great,"This alarm is terrific if you're in an apartment. For a house I would spend the money to have the whole house wired, but for apartments, it does the trick. Put one on each window/door and forget about the $100's in gates and bars. I refuse to be the prisioner in my own abode with gates and bars on the windows... I live in NYC. This alarm is loud and the batteries can be tested without setting it off. If you have old wooden windows it may not line up properly but you have a half inch deviance to play with before it activates, but most of the windows in NYC are energy efficent aluminum double glass..so for $6.06 each they're a bargain. I highly recommend it for apartment living."
2,Battery replacement,This product does exactly what it says it will and it is loud enough to alert you from a good distance. It was super easy to install and putting in the batteries before you install it is a breeze. But once the darn thing is installed changing the batteries is a nightmare. Thank goodness the batteries have been good and lasted a long while but both times I had to replace them I was cussing enough to shop for another alarm. I'm changing to the AAA battery alarm.
3,Decent Window Alarm for the Price,"Very compact but has earsplitting sound, what I was looking for. Installation is straight forward but kind of difficult to attach it to the window frame so the ""switch"" can be activated. It really depends on what kind of window and your intended location but the price is right. I wish it tooks AAA batteries instead of the button cells."
5,Cheap and good,Not much you can say about a stylus but I'll try. These stylus's are nice and heavy..and I mean heavy. It almost seems like the shaft is made out of all metal. They are quite durable and work great althought the tips may be a bit dull for some people.
5,Very interesting,This is really a very interesting book that show us a different kind of life. I hope a lot of people have the chance of reading it.
2,Heart of the Hunter,"Not his best, but worst of all is the exceptionally poor translation from the original Afrikaans into English. He deserves better !!"
2,A jumble on the veldt,"I recently read Meyer's Blood Safari, so I really wanted to like this novel. But I just couldn't- perhaps it's just not a particularly good translation from Afrikaans. I found the plot very hard to follow- much of the action hinges on a counter-intelligence operation set in motion by one of the South African security services. The details are parceled out so sparingly that after a while you just stop caring about it. The subplot concerning ""Tiny's"" Cold War exploits is silly: a huge African wielding an assegai as a KGB assassin ? Really ? It's also apparent that Meyer has little experience of being around Americans; the one American character is a two-dimensional Ugly American."
4,Heart of the Hunter,Another of Deon Meyer's compelling reads. This one contained some chilling insights into the crookedness so prevalent in today's justice system
3,Not as in-depth as MacArthur's other devotionals,"This is a daily devotional book. Each month has a particular theme or topic to it.Each day has a small portion of Scripture and a brief thought about it. This is MacArthur's third daily devotional book.In my opinion this book is not as good as the first two. This book is very basic and lacks the depth of his other two devotionals.I suspect this book is marketed more as a gift book to introduce someone to MacArthur's teachings.Overall, this devotional can be skipped by the people who like the in-depth teaching of MacArthur."
4,Rerelease,"This is a rerelease of the first two books in one of Diane Duane's earlier series. It's very good, though some of the relationships in it makes it unsuitable for younger readers. Very surprising if you've only read the authors 'Young Wizards' or the spinnoff of that series 'Cat Wizards' series.The central character is a young nobleman, who is trying to unleash his dormant magical abilities. Abilities that only women have been able to use for untold generations. Along the way, he aides his boyfriend the renegade prince of a neighboring kingdom, as well as a fire elemental, and a distant cousin. Not to mention a dragon. Oh, did I mention that the demonic Shadow wants the guy as dead as possible, and out of its way?If you read fantasy, and don't have a problem with unconventional lifestyles, you should pick up this book."
4,tennis rocks,If you love tennis you'll have to buy this game.It is so funnnnnnnn.Men tennis rocks that's why you have to buy this game.It is a little challangeg but once you play it it will be more fun.This game is more funnier then it looks.It roccccckkkkkkkkksssssssssssss.
4,they look good,"these look great on in the bus.but got a small dent when I was placing them. it wasn't too easy to put them in, but probably nothing to do with the hubcaps. old wheels."
3,Purchase city travel guides instead,"I bought this book because we were traveling to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. I wish the Kyoto section had more detail, which is why I wish I would have purchased a city specific Tokyo and Kyoto guides separately. Books can get bulky on a trip, but I feel as if I missed a lot buying a Japan only book."
4,Glitches when used on Kindle,"After perusing the printed edition (borrowed from the library) we decided to take a Kindle version with us. The initial impression is not so positive - the table of contents is incomplete, finding information on cities like Hiroshima was very difficult. I ended up consulting the printed edition to help me find the information in the Kindle one as chunks of the table of contents are missing. Also, the maps look pretty faint and hard to see on the screen.While I give the printed edition 4 stars (****) I think the Kindle edition loses a star due to reduced usability."
4,Frommer's Japan,It is difficult to get really good uptodate travel books about countries in the far east. This book is good but not excellant. Just too many changes taking place especailly in countries like Japan. We found we could rely on information and data about historical landmarks and areas. Hotel and restaurant iformation changes so quickly you may be better off going to the internet.
4,Great advise!,Before our Japan trip we had done minimal research on Tokyo and Kyoto aside from restaurants. The book was great about providing details about districts in the cities and helpful tips for navigating the city. We still relied on our concierge at the hotels for detailed directions on the subway and trains but the book was very useful.If you are looking for just a breif overview this book is perfect. We were in Japan for 9 days and more focused on learning about the culture and food than all the historic sites so we needed minimal details about historic sites. If you are more interested in the history then I would recommend a different guide book.
4,"A good, solid choice","Whenever I travel abroad, I usually buy at least two travel guides to pore over before I leave, but I travel with only one. This is the one I took with me to Japan because it seemed the most practical and comprehensive for its size. Although it doesn't have the depth and the off-beat information of the Lonely Planet series, the Frommer provides solid paragraphs about the attractions as well as reliable recommendations for dining and lodging (though I wish they provided longer lists.) The walking tour sections are well-planned, and the cultural details are accurate. Because of the size of Tokyo, the guide divides the city into neighborhoods, a feature you'll welcome when you're there but which makes for difficult planning beforehand, as you have to page through the various areas to find all the hotels in your price range.I have never found a single guidebook to meet all my needs, but, if you can only buy one, this would be a good choice."
5,Informative and Reliable,"I've been living in Japan for six months now, using this book to plan a number of trips to various places. So far, it hasn't let me down once; recommended eateries and accommodation have been excellent, and the guides to attractions have been accurate and helpful.It is targeted at people who speak no Japanese, and who are interested in seeing the tourist sights. If you're interested in hiking around the bits of Japan that no tourists visit, you'd be better off with a different book. However, I don't see that as a flaw of this book. It does what it sets out to do extremely well."
4,Very user friendly and well structured guide,I have the Japan Solo and Lonely Planet guides as well but this is my favorite. I rely on this one for recommendations on accomodation (excellent that this guide details proximity to transportation & sights) & must sees. This is the only one that explains public bath etiquette -prepares the first time visitor for such an experience. The layout of the guide makes for easy reference - the glossary of common Japanese terms and phrases is very helpful as well. Japan Solo has the best maps though.
2,Not for the Kindle,The content is decent for Tokyo and Kyoto but the book is not designed for the kindle. The book has few internal links which makes it quite awkward to navigate. Very hard to search for specific cities that are not part of the table of contents. Stick to Lonely Planet or Rough Guide when using a kindle.
3,Very poor index,"I found the index in this guide to be very poor,and coverage of places to visit quite incomplete.I spent 2 months in Nara and Kyoto 30 years ago,but could not find two of my favorite temples inthis book. They were neither in the index norin the section on Nara. In addition, when I triedto look up Yoyogi in Tokyo and Saihoji in Kyoto,neither one was in the index. I had to searchthrough the book myself to find them. I wouldhave bought a different book if I had realizedthis was so incomplete."
3,"Uneven, with a couple of super tracks","This album is worth buying for three or four tracks, particularly ""Common Thief"", ""One Step From The Gutter Baby"", and ""We'll Keep Our Chains"". Most of the rest seems competent, pleasant enough, and rather glib and smug--although my ""glib and smug"" may be your ""cynical and sophisticated"". Songs like ""S-T-R-E-S-S"" sound rather generic. Not the best of Godard's work, but the good songs incorporate Northern Soul and intelligent pop and vocals that are ironic rather than annoying."
2,more 80s liberal propaganda,"Yes the show's original premise was about a woman who hired a man to front for her PI business as she felt no one would take her seriously, but I don't recall the liberal bs continuing throughout the series. However, after watching these episodes again after all these years I realized it was a running theme. There was one ludicrous episode where the villain was a man trying to kill a woman who inherited her dad's estate. The man did it because ""no woman should run a company"". I mean come on. And I was just a kid watching this brainwashing. I even remember writing a letter to NBC to get the show to continue."
2,"I love the SHOW, the DVD's are another story!","HelloI won't sell you on the show-it's one of my favorites, and you can read other's opinions there. What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player. So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable. It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all. We don't have this problem with ANY other movies. SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK. All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP. What a shame.GOOD LUCK!"
5,Favorite season,"I think this is ultimately my favorite season of the show. ""Imagine the possibilities ..."" Again, a guilty pleasure, but if you love season 1 how can you stop watching?"
1,Disappointed!,"I was super excited to get the 2nd season, but was EXTREMELY disappointed when I received Season 5 and 6 in the mail instead. This was clearly marked and yet I still received the wrong item. I kept the product this time, since I would be ordering it in the future anyway. But next time I will be returning any issues.I cannot actually rate this DVD, BECAUSE I DIDN'T receive the right item!"
3,Remington Steele II,"The series is wonderful, but there were severe quality problems with the discs. Two episodes were unviewable on a new purchase. One bad band on each of the two discs. I'd give the series a rating of five, but the quality control was inferior."
4,Remington Steele - season 2,"Pierce Brosnan is back as the private eye Remington Steele, this former gentleman thief is at the first two episodes, the best ones in season 2, are the sound like the james bond theme...and it is like little a Bond movie....Season 1 is however better but this one is a classic also..."
3,"Heath Zenith SL-6197-B Traditional Décor Series Wireless Door Chime Push Button, Off-White",the doorbell came in a timely manner. i have not opened it. I found a different button that goes with my front doorbell that works and i don't need this bell now.
3,woody is always good,"Allen's first film as director, not the one of his best, but a good start to his brilliant career. All charasteristics of his ego are here seeding. After this about one movie a year which is pretty incredible. I hope he keeps going."
4,I love his sense of humor,"Woody Allen has a delightful way of seeing the ridiculous, the silly, the ambiguous side of life and portrays it perfectly in his many movies. Take the Money and Run was one of his earlier movies and I laugh every time I watch it."
3,IN SEARCH OF WOODY ALLEN,"This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons, in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema."
4,Hilarious film - Not so good DVD,"As others have written, this is a hilarious Woody Allen film. However, for DVD fans and film purists, be warned: the original widescreen format has been chopped down to full screen. This is a gross injustice as other films in his catalog are given better treatment and maintain their original aspect ratio."
1,wont play in australia,Was disappointed when DVD arrived in the mail as it would not play on my player because of area code.
5,More Nutritious Than A Bowl Of Steam!,"Woody definitely hit the comedy goldmine here with the story of Virgil Starkwell, World's Most Incompetent Criminal!Done in a Prison/Heist movie meets Documentary style, Woody Allen and his inspired cast take you for a hilarious ride through the underworld with one hilarious mishap after another coming at you at machine gun pace. Punctuated by a great Marvin Hamlisch score and the authoritative yet clipped over-serious narration of the late Jackson Beck underlining the most absurd and hilarious moments, this is one movie that you just cannot tear yourself away from or stop laughing at and with.Thrill and howl as you witness Virgil's cello virtuosity (LOL) in a marching band, his attempt to escape a chain gang that results in his imprisonment with an insurance salesman and his attempts at raising a family while on the run.A comedy classic if ever there was! The Best of THE EARLY FUNNY ONES!"
1,Not widescreen-letterbox only.,"Played fine on my US Spec Blu Ray player but it is not widescreen, it is only 4:3 letterbox. Wait until the actual blu ray comes out."
3,"Not his best, but not his worse...","Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades. It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years passé, but interesting for anyone who remembers ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" growing up..."
2,Took My Money,"I was expecting the picture to be sharper. Looking at the screen too closely, the images seem to strain the eyes. I don't recommend this product. A bit disappointed."
1,Can not play it,it is region 2 and I did not notice this when I bought it and the notice should have been larger so I could not play it
1,Spectacularly Bad,"I've never seen a worse comedy. It has a promising idea (that a criminal would fail at every turn) but is so tightly over scripted that you can't even laugh in the wrong places. There are none of the quirky truthful insights about real life that ""Annie Hall"" later had. Woody Allen must be an absolutely humorless person. The only good thing that can be said is that this failure forced him to go in a different direction."
2,Was not compatable,Was not able to play it on my DVD player. Only works on my laptop. Would like to be able to view on my television.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A free-wheeling comedy by Allen, made before Annie Hall ushered in his more serious phase, Take the Money and Run offers a lot of laughs in a short period of time; its humor is not always sophisticated, but it should crack you up quite a bit."
2,Unintended Side Effects,"Probably the least funny of the old Woody Allen films that I've been re-visiting. Although I really did like the scene where he is given an experimental vaccine and suffers the unusual, ""Side effects of turning into a rabbi for several hours."""
4,Take the Money and Laugh.,"Not many can see Woody Allen as a thief, if even a simple pick-pocket, but yes, he has been one. I have no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie he has ever done. It has so many scenes that I have loved, but to mention my favorite would lead to sheer chaos. So I will.Woody Allens character needs money desperately, and so, in a short thought attempt, he jimmies open a gumball machine and gets away with pockets and pockets of quarters.I have not much to say about this film other than I wouldn't recommend buying it, but you at least have to see it,"
5,ahhhh.......,my hubby and i both use this type of cushion at home.........it really adds comfort and support to any chair or divan.......the red one is for me.....i love the color......be careful though......it is addicting !!!wears well.......
3,recoil,"Movie was ok, worth three stars, but don't want to be too critical of it as I keep buying Seagal movies."
3,Movie,It is one of those movies that is like all the rest shoot em up deals. Well that is what goes on in this flick.
3,More Or Less Your Run Of The Mill B-Action Movie,"The Picture quality of this BD Disk is stellar, with the sound almost as good. The movie itself is alright, Its your basic revenge action movie. Danny Trejo is what made me buy this movie & I would recommend it if its on sale again."
3,JUST O.K.,I'M NOT REALLY A STEVE AUSTIN FAN BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT AND BECAUSE DANNY T. WAS IN IT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING.
2,Bad rip-off of a bad Punisher movie.,"The plot was a rip-off of the old Punisher movie. The acting was two dimensional, and the dialogue was worse than cliche. This movie is well worth taking a pass on."
1,steve austin proves he and dwayne johnson can not act at all,wrestlers should not be acting in movies because they prove they can not act at all i remember when wrestlers were barely in movies back in the attitude era but for some odd reason wwe is making movies and the wrestlers they have make movies i remember the greatest times of wrestling when i was growing up but wwe now is no longer the attitude era wwe is now a pg rated kids show how lame and boring and the movies they make and produce stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Hilarious,I was so excited to see this. I used to watch this show years ago and thought it was just so funny. Loved that this is the first episode...would love to find more. Received this as told I would and in excellent shape. Thank you
4,mommy,"This is overall a great swing, it has different speeds perfect for when baby is really active or just relaxing. The only thing that could make this swing better would be a side to side cradle motion, but I picked it because its probably one of the best looking pack n plays out there...Its not so babyish looking to where you can actually have it out in your house."
1,Broke,"I registed for this swing and received it at my baby shower. Although it is very appealing to the eye, within 2 weeks the motor broke and the swing would not start swinging without assistance from myself or my husband. My daughter was only 7lb when the motor broke. I returned the swing and exchanged it for the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Travel Swing. GREAT PRODUCT & 1/2 the price!!!"
2,narrow space,"it has several good features such as you can reserve the swing time and 6 speed options (I am not sure other swings also have these features); however, it makes too much gear noise when it swings. Also, when you try to detach the blanket, it makes loud noisy and baby was frightened if she was sleeping and I do not like the blanket to be dragged on the floor if you do not wanna cover on a baby. The last big issue, it is too narrow, so my baby looks very uncomfortable (she is uncomfortable). BTW, my baby is 14 pound."
2,Not Dachshund Proof,I bought this crate for my 12 pound dachshund and it is labeled to hold up to a 20 pound dog! She ripped open the front cloth in less than an hour of being in it and escaped. That was only the second or third time of use. I like the wire cages much better.
2,Bad Design,I just tried putting these thing on and I could not do it for the following reason. The tire iron that came with my 2000 honda accord would not fit the tuner adapter. Now I either need to find a tire iron that fits or find a socket wrench. I'm not sure who designed this but they weren't thinking. Now I need to spend more money buying another tool and in addition I will always need to carry this additional tool in the trunk
5,Perfect!,Fits perfectly on Hyundai i30 2010 as expected. My concern was about the esthetic but looking to the wheels you just realize the difference of each cone if you look with attention. Easy to use and prevent wheels theft!
1,Not long enough for my aftermarket wheels!,"These were not long enough for my aftermarket wheels (17x9.0 Work VSXX). I was unable to fully torque them down because they would suddenly become loose. Now I am unable to remove them because they keep spinning on the stud and it doesn't get any looser; therefore, I only have 4 out of 5 lugs torqued down correctly on 2 wheels which isn't safe at all...Horrible product...now I must waste time trying to get these off now."
1,A GREAT FILM RUINED,"HELLO?????Whoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters. How can such a thing happen? If you find the VHS buy it. Maybe some day someone will make the corrections. Until then, AVOID this DVD."
3,"Love the Movie, Hate the DVD","Yes, there are english subtitles on the 3rd and 4th subtitle channels. BUT...and here's the rub. I'm pretty sure, the subtitles are not accurate and the subtlety of Jarmusch's dialogue is ruined. Some of the humour is not there."
3,Quirky and Slow,"I guess I missed the charm of this movie others have noted, because while I found the film to be original and quirky, it is mostly slow, slow, slow. I really do like independent art films, but in this one, nothing really happens. I mean, almost nothing. That's not exactly worthy of a film, in my opinion.The idea of three interconnected stories interested me until I realized only at the end of the film that the stories of course were not interconnected at all. Although not director Jarmusch's fault, he could have really improved the film by incorporating a few techniques from Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", with its brilliant use of interconnected characters and non-chronological story telling. Alas, Jarmusch made his film before Pulp Fiction was released. Unfortunate."
3,Mystery Train,Not subtitled in English for Japanese and Italian spoken in the film. I had to use Spanish subtitles.
3,Interesting and a little startling,"I was a big Anna Nicole fan before reading this book. I had heard a few stories about her darker side and bad judgment before reading this book, but I was shocked by how she was described by the author Eric Redding. Redding describes her life and personality in a very unflattering way. (...)I felt very bad for Anna Nicole from the moment I started reading to the end.The book was written by the playboy scout Eric Redding, who discovered and represented her for a year. I think there are some bad feelings on behalf of the author. None the less, Anna has lead quite a life. The writing was OK. The imformation was interesting and some of it down right amazing. Just a little gritty for me. My impression of the sweet small town Texas girl was smashed in the first few pages. I read the whole book in 2 days. I would recomend it. Just be warned it is a sad story of a girl who has lead a hard life."
3,I Dont' Know...,"The book was rather disjointed. I bought it just to get another's perspective on her tragic life. Seems like the authors had some issues with her, so I don't know how objective their views are. However, it was entertaining. I'm now reading ""Train Wreck"" which is even more disjointed than Doll, but I just started it. I'll report back after I've finished it."
1,Friends In Low Places...,"With ""friends"" like this, who needs enemies?? Don't let this person profit off a ""dear friend""."
4,Great Big Beautiful Doll,This book was interesting in following the story of Anna Nicole Smith. It was fast reading and if you have followed the ET news of Anna Nicole then you might want to read this book too.
1,Former 'friends' write a piece of trash,What a betrayal of Anna Nicole Smith by people saying they were once her friends. The entire book portrays Anna in a negative light and appears written just to make a buck! Don't buy!
2,Way over priced!,"This is a one piece of glossy paper, folded to yield 12 ""pages"". It would be over priced at $.99, but at least more palatable. Content is OK ... it's just 4x it's value."
5,DESCRIPTION...,"Genesis to Revelation at a glance, Bible Time Line pamphlet shows hundreds of facts in biblical history. Includes dates of kings, prophets, battles, and key events. Compare Bible history, world history, and Middle East history side-by-side. Pamphlet size: 8.5 inches tall by 5.5 inches wide."
3,Disaapointing,"It turned out to be considerably smaller than I was expecting and fairly ""lightweight"" information wise. This might be good for an elementary age Sunday School student. I was expecting much more. -- CHD"
4,A Great Book,"This book is amazing! You will not be able to put it down. This book is about a group (a.k.a the Circle) of teenagers that discover that they have special powers. But an evil, dark-hearted boy (who has the marine power in the Circle) wants all six powers. Ryan, Kela (and another person's name that I can't mention or I'll ruin the book) work together to defeat the selfish member of the Circle. If you like Suspense and Adventure(and a bit of romance) then this is the book for you!"
5,Everything I hoped for,"Bought this for my boyfriend, a hunting/fishing/outdoorsman extraordinaire, once he realized that it lit up, so did his face and he drove us all nuts for the rest of the night, batteries are easy to replace once they die out."
3,uncomfortable,the location of the battery pack makes this product unwearable that's why I gave it a 3 wouldn't recommend it to anyone
5,Rammstein is da bomb!,"When I first heard this group I was on the bus going to school-I fell in love! They are so diferant. Even thoe I have know idea what they are saying it still sounds cool! They song ""Du Hast"" is my favorit. Even our bus driver liked it."
4,"A light read, adventure, action, and drama packed . . .","Acorna is definitely not in the same league as McCaffery's Dragon Riders of Pern series; however, McCaffery's fans should find it a satisfying read. I started the book in the evening on Christmas Eve, and made it about half way through before deciding I better get some sleep. I read about another third in between turkey basting, and finished if off by the end of the evening. This is very light; yet adventure, action, and drama packed reading. Not all of the plot twists and turns are predictable, which keeps it interesting. The Unicorn Girl is of an unknown species, found adrift in a space pod as an infant. As she matures, she champions the cause of child laborers on an impoverished and under-developed planet. The happy ending is sure to bring you sweet dreams . . ."
5,Contents,This collection takes place between Acorna and Acorna's Quest.Trouble in Kezdet- Mickey Zucker ReichertPony Girl by Jody Lynn NyeAcorna's Serum by Roman R. Ranieri
2,Dangerous Playyard,"While we have the previous version of this playyard, it sounds like the problems that we have encountered are still present. I agree that the changing table part is too small and not very sturdy for an infant. We used it but I constantly worried about safety. Our little girl is now big enough to sit in the playyard itself to play. I agree that you can feel the poles through the bottom of it, even with the pad. I have lined ours with blankets to make it more comfortable. This morning though, my daughter toppled over from a sitting position and banged her head on one of the four support poles. These are not padded at all and are quite dangerous in my opinion. We spent a good bit of money thinking that the Eddie Bauer name would lead to a high quality product. We have been very happy with their high chair but disappointed with the playyard."
2,good while it lasts,"i got this play yard for my son because of the portability, i returned 2 before my son was even born because they would not fold up, then when i got one that folded properly for traveling, the changing table and bassinet parts do not fit in the travel bag so you can't take them, but after 1 1/2 years, this one would no longer fold up either, called cosco the manufacturer and they said it was past warranty and nothing they could do. i wont buy anymore cosco products for my babies. my old play yard from when i was a baby 30+years ago still folds, i expect better products in this day and age."
3,Wrong Item,"If you are ordering this item from a gift registry at Babies-R-Us, then double check to make sure the person gets the correct playyard. I ordered this (pictures are the same) online for my daughter and grandson. The item she received had the same numbers but was not the same as the picture. The local store, when I arrived for the birth of my grandson, would not exchange the item because it was purchased through Amazon.com Babies-R-Us. We had to purchase a new playyard and make arrangements for the one ordered online to be picked up - then wait for 2 weeks or more for the money! I will never order online from Amazon.com again nor will I ever shop at a Babies-R-Us."
1,no assembly directions- customer service very inadequate,"Came without assembly directions, called eddie bauer customer service, they passed the buck to call djgusa who apparently makes these, sat on hold for over an hour, got a very rude person there, took over a week just to get somebody to send some assembly directions. Terrible customer service, I regard this as a horrible buying decision, will not buy from this manufacturer again for any children's accessory product. How can they not have the assembly directions available online? Also, once put together i echo the other reviewer that its rediculous to transport this."
1,"Dimes do not exist, apparently.",This bank does not recognize the existence of the dime. All dimes are recorded as being pennies. Which pretty much totally defeats the purpose of the bank. Worthless product.
3,The count was wrong a few times.,"We bought this for my 6 yr old son, who loves collecting pennies and watching his money grow [a young investor maybe?]. Anyhow, the first couple of times we filled it up and took it to coin star, the count was off by about 5 bucks. I chalked it up to my son possibly opening it up, or maybe some of the coins didn't register. Then a few times later, I had a few quarters in there, and I could see how much was in the jar, and the count on the top didn't match that.maybe mine was just defective?"
3,Don't count on it.,The counting jar is a great concept. Accuracy of this particular jar is not always as precise as an adult would want it to be. A child is thrilled with the bank as it shows the total in dollars and cents and builds expectations. The coins must be placed in the bank in such a way as to not confuse the counting mechanism. Pennies seem to be a particular problem. Just avoid placing pennies in the bank and the counting goes well.
1,not really accurate.,pretty small about the size of a medium sandwich spread jar. the slot that the coins go threw is ok but the spring loaded sensor make it hard to just drop and count. instead you have to push it in and it count according to the coin size. but since the spring is pretty strong if you don't push the coin all the way in and it pops out it will be mistaken as a dime or nickle. hence the count is off.
2,Doesn't count money very well...,"Had I known the faults of this product, I wouldn't have purchased it. I saw this product on sale in an ad and rushed out with the purpose of buying one for every grandkid because it looked fun. Only one was left which I'm extremely thankful for now!You really have to force coins into the slot due to a really strong spring inside. This causes coins to pop back out yet they've been counted. It also has a hard time telling pennies and dimes. Five dimes can go in and only be counted as $0.05.We were unable to find an on/off button. We theorized that maybe it turns off automatically like some calculators do. The end result, it stays on 24/7. I have no idea how long the batteries would last.It's cute to look at but I imagine kids might find it frustrating when the counter doesn't add up right. I would suggest looking for another bank and skip this one."
3,electronic money jar,"Cute idea. We bought it as a gift because we have one of a different manufacturer. Unfortunately, this one is smaller and less accurate in counting coins than our other one, so it's OK but not fabulous. Then again, it's cheaper and it fit our needs as a gift better."
4,counting coin bank,"This banks is cute and works well. the only problem I found with it was if you go to insert a coin and it doesnt go all the way thru the slot, the jar still counts it.Its good to have an idea of how much change you have accumulated tho."
4,Youniverse Money Jars,"I bought three of the money jars for my children. I bought the jars so that they can put their allowance in it each week and save money. The kids loved the jars and the jars really do count the money!! The only fault that I find is that the jars can be opened at the children's discretion, so therefore they get the money out and spend it rather than save it. The jars are fine, but my children need to learn that a dollar saved is a dollar earned! Thanks."
1,"Good idea, poorly designed cover","I purchased 2 money jars for my daughters earlier this year. I thought it was an awesome idea, until the counter quit within a couple weeks. I then had replacements sent, and one of them was defective on delivery. I wish they had worked as it really is awesome and exciting for the kids. It encourages them to save more. Unfortunately, they are no more useful than a $1 piggy bank."
1,Broke within one hour,Great idea...poor design! We gave this bank to my son for his birthday and it stopped working within one hour. He was very excited and then very sad!
1,Novely item at best.,"This bank looks nice on the surface. However, if you actually want it to work, pick another bank. There are several faults with the function of this bank. We bought two and they both do the same things. It is clearly a design deficiency. They often count pennies as dimes and vice versa. They also will count incorrectly if the coin is not pushed straight into the slot. You can start to push it and if it pops back up, it will count something. It does not recognize any coin greater than a quarter. Overall it is a novelty item at best. If your child tells you he put 5 dollars in the bank and the bank says there is 4.50, I would trust your child."
1,Don't Buy It,"The electronic counter stopped working after two days and I'm left with a junk plastic jar. Even if it did work, the jar is too small to save up much change. Big disappointment."
2,Error Prone,"You have to push very hard to insert the coins. My son is 6 years old and has alot of trouble with it. While struggling to get the coins in, the meter will miscount that particular coin. For example: if you are trying to get a dime in and you have to take it out and try again, then it will register as 20 cents instead of 10 cents. He grew bored with it rather quickly."
1,Dissappointed,I got this jar and it worked good all the way up until I got past $10.00. Then when I put in pennies it showed them as dimes and it stopped counting dimes. I strongly reccommend that you do not waste your money on this. Just go to the bank and have them count it.
4,Educational and Fun,"My 9 year old son is enjoying this money jar. He brought it to school for 'show and tell' and his teacher loved it. His teacher circulated it around to other teachers for a possible school purchase. It hasn't broken down, and my son has taken the lid on and off a lot, held onto the coins and tricked the counter by pushing coins in and pulling them out, and he has reset it a few times. His use of the jar isn't exactly what I had planned, but that's typical for him!"
4,ZILLIONZ Electronic Counting Money Jar-given as a gift,ZILLIONZ Electronic Counting Money Jar was an exciting gift for a 6 and 9 yr old. It was fascinating for them to see their money being counted correctly. I think it will instill saving too.
3,Electronic money jar,Out of the four I ordered there was one that didn't work correctly. The digitial readout was unclear. Otherwise it is a good product.
1,Very Disappointed,"My 7 year old son got this for Christmas and was excited to transfer all his change to this jar. I thought it was neat that he could add the money in his head and then check the display to make sure he was right. Well, he put his first quarter in and it displayed $0.30. Hmmm, that's not right! He dumped that out and decided to start over. The next four coins he dropped in, were calculated right, but then he dropped a dime in and it added $0.11 to his total. If you're looking to spend $18 dollars (including shipping) for a plastic jar worth $1.00, then this is for you. However, this is not what I expected. I was very disappointed and so was my son!"
1,TERRIBLE. DON'T BUY. DOESN'T WORK,Don't waste your money - but more importantly your time that it takes to return. this product is garbage. don't buy this.
1,Waste of $$,I just wanted to be able to count the loose change we had. It regularly does not register dimes or nickels. Total waste of 12 bucks. Try a dept store version. Dont buy this.
3,Not smart enough for my kid,"My 9 year old step-son came to live with us recently from South America. He asked me to get a money jar for him. He loves to count money and then tell me how much it would be in Pesos. So I bought this jar for him. At first, he really liked it. Then he quickly discovered its limitations. It cannot distinguish between a quarter and a silver dollar. He had 3 silver dollars, so the total was incorrect. And of course, it won't count paper money and someone gave him 3 five dollar bills. To reset the amount, he has to use a screwdriver to remove and replace the battery.About a day later, he realized that it would count money without dropping the coins all the way into the jar. So he pushed a quarter half-way in and out until the amount displayed on the jar equalled the actual total of his money, including silver dollars and paper money."
1,Ruined a 4 year old's Christmas day,"Despite many bigger, more expensive presents on Christmas Day, this was the one my 4 yr old was most excited about- he's obsessed with coins and counting money.First off, to actually insert a coin into the slot you have to press down really hard, not easy for me and so very difficult for a child.Secondly, the thing just doesn't work. Within 4 coins it misread the value of a dime, adding on 15 cents and then continued to do this ever after. To top it all, when the total got to $6.01 the readout stopped there and refused to budge and is no doubt still showing that as it languishes at the bottom of the dumpster.Save yourself some money and the crestfallen face of your child and avoid this piece of crap like the plague."
1,Wii remote charger,I bought one of these after a week and the first time I used it one of the prongs that are meant to charge the battery broke off. I tried to call the company 3 times for some kind of replacement but found out that they dont like answering their phone. I had to buy another one.The price might be nice but save your self some time and trouble and don't buy this charger.
3,It's alot cheaper at Wal-mart!,In Wal-mart stores you can buy this toy for $24.99 (not on-line). I wish I would have checked on that before I bought it here for $37.99 plus $5+ for shipping! What a rip off!!!!
2,Seconds or return ?,"Have yet to use the bit. I received the bit in the mail and was surprised to see the condition of the protective case inside the mailer box. The case looked pretty beat up, was broken and taped back together, obviously shipped this way. Looks like maybe it had been kicked around the warehouse floor for a while before someone finally picked it up and put some tape over the missing pieces of the case. The bit does not appear to be damaged but I will be careful the first time I flip the switch, 10,000 rpm is worthy of respect even with proven bits."
5,Irresistible,"I truly loved the creativity and humor from the beginning to the end of Pippi in the South Seas by Astrid Lindgren. This story, about an irresistible girl with two red pony tails and lots of freckles, takes the reader on voyage to the exciting island of Kurrekurredutt. I especially liked Pippi's loyalty to her friends, her imagination, charm, and wit. This story of wonder teaches children and adults to always help others and keep imagining. Undoubtedly, the PACES PAideia Study Guide for this book helped me understand the story better. The Parent Questions and Homework Questions in the Study Guide gave my mother and me good ideas to talk about. The Journals made me write about Pippi in my own words. As an eleven year old, I found this book extremely entertaining."
2,Pippi,Tape was a disappointment scratchy and understood it was DVD which of course it was not the discription was too vague. So $56NZD was poorly spent.
4,"Once the reader is close to the end, there is no stopping.","John Farris' ""The Uninvited"" is a fantastic book. It is a psychological suspense which gradually introduces the reader to the characters and the setting but then explodes with horror and suspense within the last few chapters of the book."
5,timeless,"This is a timeless recording. Although it has lots of the elements of a typical new wave album ABC did such a superb job that this album sounds modern enough for 2003 ( the year I discovered it). Probably one of the main reasons why it sounds so great is the excellent production done by Trevor Horn - one can really enjoy the multilayered and intrinsic sound of the songs (using quality headphones to listen to the CD is recommended :-) ) . This recod is proof that if the music is good the style (pop, rock, symphony, etc) doesn't matter that much."
5,an epiphany on every page,"""When the great lord passes the wise peasant bows deeply and silently farts."" This book marks one of those moments for me when rethink just about everything...from elusidating certain truisms to hammering out theories and ideas that ring remarkably true, Scott's book is challenging, powerful, and engaging. Reading this book is like sitting in his office conversing...I find myself exclaiming and agreeing aloud. I really enjoy his comments on gender; a concept I have felt comfortable with for years, and suddenly I feel as though he has just clarified it for me. I have been doing double-takes as random comments about women in my primary sources (about fickleness of emotion) which I thought I could chalk up to typical misogyny begin to catagorize themselves in my mind as the effects of attempting to live within hidden and public transcripts. Very readable, interesting, engaging...in a word, fabulous."
2,Domination and the Arts of Resistance,"This book is a clear indication of the problems with modern historians: the tendency toward presumption and the discovery of common sense as if it were a new planet. Scott claims to understand the REAL story beneath ordinary daily discourses, going so far as to state that young inner city black men play a game that involves trading insults in order to ""practice"" reacting to racism in non-violent ways. How ridiculous!Scott also attempts to prove his thesis by stating that alcohol sometimes plays a role in hidden transcripts becoming public. I suppose he hasn't had much experience with alcohol or those who have partaken of alcohol, else he would realize this is painfully obvious and not a groundbreaking revelation.I give the book 2 stars because of its readability and the obvious effort put into the research. However, I cannot recommend it, for it is a perfect example of historians who spend too much time in the office, and not enough time in the real world."
5,Professional Review,"Children and Their Art is the most comprehensive textbook available for teaching art education methods. This bestselling textbook covers all aspects of teaching art in the elementary classroom: the basic principles and goals of art education, the characteristics and needs of children as learners, the core principles of art as a subject-aesthetics, principles of design, art history, art media-and all aspects of instruction-curriculum planning, sample lessons, classroom management, and assessment. The seventh edition has been thoroughly updated and includes coverage of the National Standards for Art Education as well as the impact of postmodern thought on the practice of art education. It also provides a concise overview of child development theories and the latest findings on child development and brain research, including Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences."
4,Good ideas,Heavy reading but good ideas and information throughout for teachers wanting to add some art to their day :)
3,Children and Their Art,This is the first time I ordered a book from Amazon and was a bit disappointed. The book was not on it's original binder it was in a note book binder and it was hard to manage. Plus some pages were missing but copies were made and attached.Overall the book served its purpose but it was not what I expected and as I mentioned it was difficult to turn pages. It would have been okay if this information had been disclosed when I ordered it. Then I would have known what to expect.
5,Good Motherboard,I used this motherboard for my pentium II computer. It is working perfertly without any problem. I did have to replace the battery on the motherboard. It accepts ATA 100 hard drive.
4,"Plenty of ""Bells and Whistles""","Rightey, I like this mobo a lot!!! Plenty of cool features and 'toys! not totally on the ""cutting edge"", but, is VERY reliable and stable. Booted at first 'post"", and has been running perfectly since. Highly recommend it."
3,"Good motherboard, just be careful what RAM you get","I have had this motherboard since July and it's very good with many useful features. You have to be careful what type of RAM you buy because (like me) if you buy the wrong type of RAM, you could be in trouble. Visit their website and see the recommended RAM list before buying the RAM. I did manage to make my RAM (OCZ Gold 2x512mb) work after updating the BIOS (with a different RAM I had to borrow) but I cannot use some of the features (such as overclocking) as the PC will just restart every few minutes (because it automatically changes the RAM settings and voltage). My system isn't stable either if I use the RAM at 800 MHz (the advertised speed of the RAM) so I'm stuck using it at 667 MHz."
4,Instructions are poor compared to the quality of the parts,"Most parts are well molded and all parts were intact. This model is not for the casual modeler as some of the instructions are not accurate or clear and due to the moving parts that require very accurate assembly this could cause major headaches. If you get this model read ahead in the instructions, prefit the parts before gluing, and compare the parts locations to the assembled images of the engine on the box.Although I rated it highly, it appears that Testor dropped the ball on the instructions,I also suggest that some parts be painted to match the pictures or real engines. Painting makes a noticable improvement in the display."
5,Singer/songwriter/pianist shines throughout album!,"Having heard Temby live several times, I can say that the recorded tracks live up to the reputation this artist has for his live performances. I especially love the soaring notes of ""Sweet Denmark"" and the uplifting ""Pocket Change"" but the singer/songwriter/pianist shines throughout the album. Speaking the language of the piano, this powerful artist is a masculine counterpart to others such as Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan."
2,Good Book...Bad Timing,I purchased this book 2 weeks ago which happened to be the same time that AutoDesk released it's free 3ds max 7.5 update to current subscribers. This update includes hair and fur as well as a newer version of Mental Ray. This is where the problem with this books tutorial dvd comes in. Almost everyone of the files I opened from the cd gave me several .dll errors or mental ray version mismatch error rendering the dvd useless. So without any of the files that the lessons in the book refer to it's very difficult to learn any of the material that this book was intended for. If you are using 3ds max 7 and not 7.5 then this would probaly be a good book for you. But free hair and fur and a new cloth engine is your trade off.
2,Fair book for the money,"This book only has a few business forms. Considering its low cost, it's not a bad book overall. I thought it would teach me how to do bookkeeping, but it basically just gives you a few business forms. I would not pay more than five dollars for it. The word ""simplified"" in the book's title is really what the book is all about entirely."
2,Not the best quality,The pan is okay but is very light weight and scratches very easily even if you are careful. It was cheap and I will use it but not what I expected.
4,A truely warm film.,"While this film doesn't rank with Manhatten or Annie Hall, it is by far his sweetest and most approachable film. A warm look back on the family and community during the time when radio was king. This film would also be a great entry point as an introduction to the work of a great director."
5,When radio was king,"Woody Allen narrates the story of a romanticized boyhood during WWII, a time when the medium of radio was at its zenith. The loosely connected vignettes tell the stories of the boy (Seth Green) and his poor Jewish family, his perpetually disappointed and lovelorn aunt (Diana Weist), and a young woman striving to make it in show biz (Mia Farrow), interspersed with anecdotes about the personalities that entered America's homes through the airwaves every day. Allen shows us what radio meant to the people of that time, leaving even those of us who are too young to have experienced it ourselves feeling a little wistful and sad at its passing. This is a delightful movie."
5,You will laugh yourself silly.,"This movie depicts the life of a young boy growing up during the golden age of radio. I laughed from start to finish. With a stellar cast, this movie is a delight."
4,A great introduction,"This soundtrack is an excellent introduction to big band music of the 1940, including the familiar ""In the Mood"" and ""Take the 'A' Train,"" as well as novelty tunes like ""I Double Dare You"" and ""The Donkey Serenade."" This CD features a variety of song styles: some with vocals (from operatic to ""Betty Boop"" and back), some upbeat (hooray for the troops!), others hauntingly melancholy (Benny Goodman's ""Goodbye""). However, most will make swing dancers tap their toes and practice their moves. Anyone new to the music of the Big Band era with get a good flavor of the 1940's and be introduced to 10 classic orchestras on this unique soundtrack disc."
4,Turn on those Atwater Kents,"Woody Allen's very nostalgic and lighthearted look at radio in the 1930s-40s. Consisting of a series of vignettes, from true incidents (Welles's ""War of the Worlds"", the Jessica McClure in-the-well rescue story from Texas) to made-up ones (Allen's favorite NYC and Coney Island landscapes and the lives of people living there). It isn't much of a movie per se, just Allen evoking on film some favorite glimpses of his from the past. No big laughs, no major themes; ""like watching someone's home movies--though expertly made home movies."" There is also a great music score of old standards."
5,Intimate gem and a wonderful hommage,"Giving the enormous genius and extensive Woody Allen's work (one of my Top Five American Directors)it is practically impossible for me to choose a favorite.Nevertheless, ""Radio Days"" is Allen's movie that I enjoy the most, based on a pure emotional impulse. Here you find the perfect mix of fun and love: Allen evocative memory of his infancy is treated with such tenderness and understanding, fun and respect, that even not being born or lived in the radio era you ends loving it as the author did.And that is precisely a great piece of art: the one that correctly connect the audience with the subject depicted.Everything here works: the superb music selection, the link between music and situations, the mood of every scene, characters and actors, and Allen's own appearance as the narrator.A masterpiece."
4,The Avenger!,"This film is a great study on the 40's era when radio was king. If you want a nostalgic look back... in a Woody Allen sort of way then buy this film. I bought it brand new, super cheap and think it is a great film along the lines of A Christmas Story.A Christmas Story (Two-Disc Special Edition)A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic Film"
5,the best of the best,"This is my favorite of all the Woody Allen Movies I've seen. It's tender, nostalgic, as well as hilarious as are most of his comedies. It's a complete joy!"
4,Great Movie but saddened,"This movie is one of my favorites. I grew up listening to music from the 30's and 40's, musicals, opera, classical etc. But I was really disappointed that this cd didn't include the Kurt Weil & Maxwell Anderson rendition of September Song. My father who learned to play piano by ear, played this song when I was growing up and also others. But I would really love to have a copy of this version. Mr. Allen if you do another collection of favorites, please include this version of September Song. Thank-you. Whenever I grow leary of our computerized world, I put on this movie."
4,sweet movie,"I did like it;however, Woody at times talked a little too much.When Joe saw the torpedo boat break through the water Woody should have shut up for a few seconds.I do have a inquiry;what was the name of the tune that was being played when Joe's parents were watching the search lights? I do have a closed caption on my tv;however, it didn't give the name.If anyone knows please let me know,thanks."
3,Radio Days,"I did enyoy the movie because I am the same age as Woody Allen andremember what radio was like similarly to how he remembered.I wish they'd done a little more of what radio was like duringWWII, but I still thought the movie was pretty entertaining."
1,Not ANYTHING like I expected!!!,"Certainly a movie for the ages...but the CD offered only a fraction of the songs from the film, only 16 tracks, and none of the product descriptions provided a list except to say only a couple were missing...boy, was that ever wrong! Still, the music is top quality even though none have been re-mixed for stereo.Here's a list of titles from the CD...but you're going to be alot happier watching the movie for all the great music..."
5,Good speedy service,I received the item as promised with good speedy service. Thank you. Will buy more from this seler
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TREE,"I purchased this tree for my daughter's bedroom. When it arrived, it had a warning in small print on the box - This tree exposes you to lead. Wash hands after using. There is no mention of lead exposure on the web site. I never would have bought this for my daughter if I had known that it exposed her to lead! This should be illegal!"
4,Good overall,"The tree was a little bit bent when i received it but it was easily fixed, got it for my apartment since i don't have lots of space for a full sized tree and it looks great. I recommend this for anybody with little space for a big tree."
1,I hate the military club,"WOW...I have never read a book so anti-military. I am a hispanic member of the armed forces (Marines) by choice not by the ""poverty draft"". I saw the title and it peeked my interests. I wanted to know the 10 good reasons and the more I read the more I was just amazed on how much the author hates the military. Everything in the book is a ""MAY HAPPEN"" not ""WILL HAPPEN"". Granted does what the author says occur... sure anything can happen, but the author makes it seem like it will happen. If you really want to know about the military and military life then ask someone who is in the military. Ask them questions whats it like, why did you stay in, why did you get out...don't rely on a book written by someone who was never in the miliary. Thats like asking a nun what its like to be a porn star."
1,freedom,"words about men who love their country, but much more than that love one another. They sacrifice themselves so that we all may live. So that any citizen can have the freedom to spend all of their time writing books about detering citizens from joining and disrespectfully yet freely expressing their opinions. Before critizing and writing petty excuses, without our military defense, when our thousands of enemies walk on our land and march up to you and you simply respond ""oh I do not believe in fighting"" you have no idea what you are talking about. The core of patriotism to our country eludes you entirely. Defend your own freedom in the harsh reality of the world that you can thankfully say have never experienced. Ask not what our country can do for us, but what we can do for our country."
1,The BEST reason NOT to join,"The very BEST reason NOT to join the military (or be a policeman, firefighter or non-union teacher) is that you won't have to wonder too hard whether or not you did anything to promote freedom, peace and justice in the world. You'll know that you probably didn't."
4,Must-Have for IPhone owners....,"I have the black one, and it has been working very well for me so far. It fits very snugly, and does an excellent job at protecting my phone. It was easy to put on, and I haven't noticed any breakage or wear that others have mentioned.It looks nice, and none of the functionality of the IPhone has changed. You can still get to all the buttons and controls, and there is a hole in the back that exposes the camera, so picture-taking is not inhibited. The only downside is that it takes a little while to get the screen protector on so that it lays down flat, without any air bubbles. After you get that taken care of, you are good-to-go.Great product, especially for the price. I recommend it-"
2,Appears to be a quick to market first gen product,"No phone jack hole? Also, be careful with most of these inexpensive quick to market products. These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet. Thus, the iPhone is unable to determine proper lighting conditions. I.e., daytime, evening."
3,A little disappointed,"I was so excited about getting this silicone case for my iPhone. I prefer to have it in this type of cover. Unfortunately when I received it, I discoverd that I could not plug it in to the adapter in my car. There is no hole for that. Also, there is no hole for the lock button on top. I ended up switching back to the hard case."
2,Not as great as I'd hoped,"This cover is so thin, it provides little or no impact protection. It fits ok, but there is always a gap on the front at the top and bottom of the screen. The cut-outs are generally in the correct place, but there is no cut-out for the headphone jack. The iPhone will not sit on the dock when in the case.On the plus side, it's cute and slim and will definitely keep the body of the iPhone from getting scratched up. It provides a nice, tacky rubber body for you to hold on to when you're using the iPhone.Overall, though, it is not worth the price once you add the shipping (I paid $6.99 for the case and $6.52 for shipping). This item should be priced at $4.99 with no more than $2 for shipping (it weighs about as much as a quarter)."
1,0 stars,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Christopher Kennedy Masterson is completely horrible in his portrayal as the lead role and the writer/director should rethink their career options. Don't waste your time!
1,Time waster,"Deserves 0 stars. You continue to wait for something to happen, but nothing does. This flick hits with a dull thud. Maybe people with a dark sense of humor ""get it,"" but I don't. This movie proves that an interesting blurb on a DVD box will get people to watch anything."
2,Not necessarily so gfood,"While there are some interesting elements in the book and it is a unique lookat the supposed childhood of Jesse James, I do not recommend it for children. There is a lot of swearing in it. I know most folks are exposed to swearing all the time, but I do not want that for my children. It is possible to write wonderful fiction and get the point across without having to resort to using swearing. As I read old time fiction I notice this!Secondly I do not like Matt's attitude toward his mother. He is not respectful, he hides things from her. I do not like my chidren being exposed to things like that."
5,Good overall service and quality,I loved everything about the chain that I bought. Delivery was speedy and everything arrived in excellent condition. Chain has a smooth feel and also a weighty feel so it feels ANYTHING but cheap. Great overall service! THANKS AGAIN!
4,GBA Flood Light,"I bought the flood light by gamester last christmas and it is a pretty good light. It's very bright, prevents hot spots on the screen and clips on easily, but it leaves a glare, so sometimes it's hard to see."
4,The best external light,"I have tried them all. Worm Light, Trap Light, and a Pelican light that flips up with a screen protector. Short of cracking open your unit and installing an internal light, this one is the absolute best. It puts an even light on the screen and can be adjusted so you can see absolutely no glare.The thing that keep it from 5 stars is that it is relatively big and heavy. It really cuts down on the portability of the unit."
5,Great light!,"I have bought this on the same day I bought my GBA. I've had it for a long time now. It's true that it takes up a lot of batteries, but I already had a charger and some rechargable batteries so it wasn't a problem for me. I actually think having this light with my GBA is better than a GBA SP since the light can fold right over, light is brighter and my friends don't have any problems when watching me play; unlike GBA SP which is like looking at a flat screen computer monitor form the side. I just have one complaint about the battery cover. Why did they have to lock it with a screw? It's so annoying. Anyways if you have a GBA and are thinking of getting a GBA SP cause of the light and clam shell design, just get this light you'll save a lot of money."
4,Wonderful Light for our GBA,We really like this flood light. You can see the games on GBA so much better than any other lights we have used. It is a bit heavy but still much better than all the other lights. With the flood light you get to use the full size GBA.
4,This is the best light ever made,"Only if you get a battery charger,because the floodlight goes thru alot of batteries three at a time.I have a battery charger that charges batteries in an hour.I use chargable batteries for my gameboy advance and the floodlight works perfectly.And you will save whole lot of money on batteries and you can recharge the batteries up to a 1,000 times.And all your lighting problems will be solve with the best light ever made."
5,An OUTSTANDING product! BUY THIS LIGHT!!!,This light is worth every penny it costs -- it works GREAT!!! Nintendo ought to ship this light with every GBA they sell! It's one of the best game accessories I've ever seen. Absolutely worth the money! A **GREAT** product!!!
4,"Yep, found it...","Okay, bought them all, like this one the best. Chews batteries, works great. I found no bright or hot spots and it does not interfere with game play. Worth what I paid for it and then some. I wish I had my money back for all those other wasted lights out there. I need it to pay for batteries for this one."
5,Definatly worth your money.,I feel that this light is one of the best on the market not only does it provide the best light but it protects your screen too. I had and original gameboy and the one this I hated was that the screen would always get scratched. So if you need a light and something to protect your screen go this route.
1,I have to disagree! It's just not good!,"I thought this would be a great product. The light is so bright and white. But it still causes such a strong glare on the screen that I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to hold it. WORSE STILL, it's super heavy! It takes 3 AA batteries! So unless you are holding your GBA flat while playing it, this can cause it to flip out of your hands! Why risk dropping your GBA?Don't waste your money on this. It's just another bad GB light that doesn't do what we need one to do. ...."
4,Great addition!,"I bought one of these for my gba and it works great! Gives great light in complete darkness. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you have to put batteries in it and it is heaver and makes the unit too bulky to put in it's case. Overall, though, this is the best light for the gba! :)"
1,"Dang, that's UGLY!","Wow, I've never seen an uglier butter dish than this! I would have never guessed it was a butter dish. I'm thinking multi-vitamin .. casket .. turd??"
2,"Decent book, with dated information","The publication date on this little book is 1993, which means that this information here is fairly dated. It's not that this is necessarily a terrible book, but Down syndrome reading lists can guide parents and caregivers to more updated info that will be more useful.The reading list at the back of the book has been rendered useless by newer publications and that new invention, WEBSITES. Woo!I do recommend this book for the easy to understand second chapter, which provides a quick overview of the genetic anomalies that result in Down syndrome, although possibly an equally easy-yet-thorough explanation may be -- and likely is -- available in a newer book."
2,Bad for sensitive skin,"I was so excited to get this since I have always had very hard water and was looking for a solution to my dull hair. Well the first time I used it, it made my scalp burn and dried out my skin terribly. Now keep in mind, I have very sensitive skin so it might be fine for most, just not me. It gives me dandruff from drying up my scalp :( However it does have a wonderful grapefruit smell."
3,Ok shampoo,"I didn't think this shampoo was so amazing. I bought it after reading the reviews, and after one use, I didn't notice results like I did with another shampoo I bought at a beauty supply store that I actually noticed a difference with after one use. I think it's an okay shampoo, but it doesn't even match with a drug store brand clarifying shampoo that i got for less than half the price."
4,Kings of the Road by Ken Purdy,"Several generations old, but still a great book about the Golden Age of automobiles. My paperback copy is tattered and torn and held together with rubber bands. Bugatti and Ferrari and the other genius's of autos come alive in Purdy's book."
1,Never Received the product,"I had ordered the dvd , paid for it, even contacted them about not recieving it, but they never sent it to me. So i am going to have to say to say its a lousy product."
5,Blending of science and theology,"While there can never be a 100% correlation between science and theology this book excels in the volume of factual information supporting a non-probabilistic formation of the life-forms on earth. The data presented is broadly based and never relies on single-point examples.In the context of the intelligent design vs Darwinian selection debate, the book does not attempt to prove a method or process of development of life as we know it, rather it focusses on the necessity for an ordered approach in order to achieve the complexity and inter-related functions.No reader with an open mind will fail to find a very strong case against random evolution."
3,Love-Hate,"I had a love-hate relationship with this book. Its content is really fascinating; it collects amazing facts and anecdotes about everything from the human body to modern research in physics. But its writing style was ludicrously and distractingly over-Christian; I groaned audibly at the segue from a discussion of the mysterious dynamics of the inner ear to a reminder that we should use our ears to listen because ""softly and tenderly Jesus is calling."" So cheesy and unnecessary! The fascinating details of anatomy and molecular function are pure theology and need no superficial pseudo-spiritual commentary to make them ""Christian,"" and I can't recommend this book to many people for that reason. I found its content riveting and compelling in SPITE of the writing style."
2,porter cable blues,"No problem with Amazon. Item came very fast and just as described. Problem is that the rebuild kit did nothing to correct the problem with my nailer. I installed all of the parts as per the schematic, and this gun still mis-fires every other shot. Guess the gun is only good for two years of service. Rebuild kit was authentic from Porter Cable, but was a waste of money. My advice, buy a new nailer. That's what I did."
1,"Interesting Stories, Poor Writing","I have to agree with the other reviewers of this book. While the stories are at times interesting and a great history lesson, the writing is akin to that of a high school student's term paper. I recommend passing on this book."
1,Plenty of other much better books of presidential anecdotes,"Even when the anecdotes were interesting, the writing style was poor (re-stating something several times won't make it more interesting). A compilation is supposed to make the anecdotes more interesting and slickly written, but I found that in the cases where I had read the source of his information, the source was better. The book was a gift, so I read the whole thing, but only out of duty."
