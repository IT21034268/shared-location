3,Worth it for Gnossiennes,"The interpretation of Gnossiennes is worth the price of this CD. The slow, soulful rendition of that piece is the best anywhere. However, I agree with a previous reviewer that the downtempo approach does not work for other Satie favorites. The slow motion, low energy rendition of other pieces can be maddening."
2,From Back Cover,"IT'S CHRISTMAS IN MONTANA....What Child is This? - Melanie Briggs and her baby daughter create quite a stir when they suddenly arrive to stay at the Stone Ranch. She'd make the perfect wife in Jared Stone's opinion. Not that he has any intention to marry or become an instant dad. He fights every urge to take sweet Melanie to bed. But some things are meant to be.....I'll Be Home for Christmas - En route to Montana for the holiday, Will Stone gets stuck in a blizzard with Melanie's wild cousin, Ms. Dylan Briggs. As far as Will is concerned, the snow can't stop soon enough. Then again, sharing a bed with the sexy, sassy Dylan might be perfect way to wait out a storm!"
2,One of the best textbooks I have purchased but.....,"One of the best textbooks I have purchased; very easy to read, succint, and well-written. However, McGraw-Hill falsely advertises about the online learning tools such as online quizzes, etc. You can spend $132.00 but you are NOT getting the online learning tools as they said!"
2,Not to happy,I recently purchased tne human physiology book and tho it was a great deal... the cd that is suppose to accompany it did not come with book and that is a major part that is needed.. so in all actuality it is better to just buy the books from college book store to be sure you get what you need
1,Wrong Book,It was the wrong book. The book I received isn't even supposed to be sold in North America. The picture for the book on this ad was not the same as the cover of the book. I needed the book picture for my class and I did NOT receive that book. VERY unhappy!!!!!!
4,Worth Taking A Chance On,"If there's a worthy successor to Townes Van Zandt, it may be Dan McCarthy. Any fans of folk in the style of Townes or Greg Brown should find much to like here."
5,BAD BAD BAD,"This is probably the worst film ever made and I have seen a lot of bad films. This film seems to take many other films (the parts which end up on the cutting room floor) and paste them together. Most of the film was understandable (I guess) but what was with the lesbian snake dance in the middle of the big fight scene? If you want to laugh as hard as I did, check out this movie!"
5,The best of Dichter plays the best of Liszt.,"There is no better Liszt recording on the market at any price. The depth of understanding, brilliance of execution, and mind-boggling technical prowess make this recording a joy for novices and aficionados alike.Enjoy!"
5,Liszt presented in all his magnificence,"There are a ton of great, well-known pieces on this 2-CD set, and it's a fantastic deal! Very beautiful in all respects except that, I agree with the reviewer below--the DB range of playing is not as wide or dynamic as it should be. It would be better if it was a bit HARDER and more powerful!--this is essential for the passion and intensity that Liszt created. Also, Mephisto Waltz seems to have been shortened. But all in all, good collection at a good price."
3,Good - but where's the poetry?,"A very good and recommended recording. The only thing I miss is more lyricism. Traditionalists may argue that lyricism has little place in Liszt, but look and listen! There are lots of beautiful melodic passages that need carefull attention to phrasing and tone. It would make this recording milder and sweeter to the ear. But as far as the virtuosity is concerned, no complaints. But don't forget, you can only be flashy for so long before it gets dull....!"
5,Stove Top Smoker,This was a great item! I have smoked numerous meats and fish and love the flavor. In fact I just smoked chicken tonight with apple wood. I would suggest this to anyone who likes that smokey flavor. The product itself does not leave any smokey residue but the aroma of the wood whisps though the house. We love it in fact we bought two! I recommend this product to everyone. Thanks!
3,Seems good...,"I bought this as a fiberglass sealant. Used it on my 1965 Sea Swirl boat and then the 2011 Lance Trailer. In both cases, it went on easily, wiped off easily, and seemed to gloss things up nicely. It does NOT remove chalking, dullness, or faded paint or fiberglass. My boat still has its uneven turquoise top, but now feels very slick and has a glossy protectant coat. The boat is 15+ feet and the Trailer is 19+ feet. The small bottle is only half used after coating both.How well this product fares in the monthes to come is to be seen. It must be very new, since there appear to be no other reviews anywhere about it. I decided to try it because it was relatively inexpensive, but was dismayed to see the shipping cost as $9.45!!"
3,Love it! But don't love the price increase.,"My only complaint is that it could come with a *little* more cheese, and I could also do without seeing the word ""manure"" on the back of the box...that's not necessarily something I want to think about when I'm about to eat!EDIT 10/30/11: One year ago I placed multiple orders of this stuff for $12.97 per 6-pack (S&S; price). Now they're asking $21 for it with S&S;!? I understand there is some inflation in food prices lately, but a 62% increase?? For some dried pasta shells and a packet of cheese powder, gimme a break. Out of control!!! For this reason I'm knocking my 5* review down to 3* and I've placed my last order for this stuff. It was fun while it lasted, Annie! Pigs get slaughtered."
4,My 15 yr old dd absolutely loves Fred and loves his movie.,"My daughter has been a ""Fred"" lover for a long time now. If you don't like the movie and you don't get the humor, then you don't know the origins of Fred. Fred has a high pitched voice and acts totally immature because when he started on his youtube episodes, he was acting like a six year old. In keeping somewhat with his youtube character, he has mixed a teenage character with the elementary school character together. My daughter and I watched it together and then my daughter watched it at least a couple more times within the first 24 hours. She wants the DVD. It will be a Christmas present. I thought the kid in the forest was the best part. That made me crack up!"
4,FRED: the Movie,This movie is probably the stupidest movie I've seen. It reminds ofDisaster Movie (Unrated Widescreen)because of the stupidity of the movie. But I liked it. It was funny and just flat out stupid. Kids will enjoy and people who enjoy stupid humor.
1,Worst Movie EVER,"I am 24, my 8 year old stepdaughter thinks this is awesome. This has got to be the most awful movie ever created. How this guy makes any money, how anybody would even want to watch this makes no sense to me at all. His voice is awful, the plot is horrendous, and the whole time I wanted to beat my head against the wall. HORRIBLE!!"
1,#1 Worst Movie Ever Made,"My 6 year old daughter really wanted to watch this movie so I finally caved and agreed to put it on for her. I was able to endure about 15 minutes of this whiny, screechy torturefest before the urge to gouge out my own eardrums with a screwdriver became too overwhelming to bear. Fred is basically an overgrown toddler whose high-pitched whining reaches decible levels previously unknown to mankind. This kid's perpetual temper tantrum deserves a spanking and a time-out at best. How it ever yielded him his own film (not to mention a sequel...my ears hurt just thinking about it) will forever remain a mystery. Oh the horror..."
1,Torture,If it was possible for me to gain access to a time machine I would go back to the moment before I watched this abomination and stab out my own ears and eyes just so a version of me existed that has never seen or heard this crime against humanity.
2,WHAT ?,bought this movie for my daughter because she thinks Fred is funny I say whatever I think this movie has got to be the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen I sure hope they don't make another one.
1,one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie seriously does stink its annoying boring and one of the worst movies ever made i hate this movie with a passion if you want to watch real entertainment movies look elsewhere because you will not find it here in this lame movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,NO,"I haven't seen this movie, but I've seen two seconds of a Fred video, which is enough to know that I would literally rather be disemboweled Samurai style than watch this movie. If you enjoy Fred, that's fantastic. Get all your friends together and have a Fred/Star Wars Prequels Double Feature night. Just don't expect me to be there."
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"My kids (6 year old boy/girl twins and an 8 year old boy) have been begging me to watch the movie. I kept putting it off after seeing some of the YouTube videos. His voice is horrendous, making me want to lock myself in a padded cell. But worse than that are the depictions made throughout the movie. In one video he had his mother's used underwear on his head. Disgusting!! Partying like a frat boy with vomiting and sexual innuendos is not appropriate for young kids. It's not ok for children to see a kid that is obviously emotionally and socially unstable deal with his drug and alcohol addicted mother and a father who's supposedly on death row. WHY??? There is no way I am letting my children see this garbage. There are many other, more positive things I can be doing with my kids besides watching this idiot make a fool of himself."
4,"Pixie Lott carries the movie, Lucas OK","Pixie Lott (Judy in the Movie) did an excellent job with her scenes. Same with Jennette McCurdy as Bertha. Lucas Cruikshank was more annoying than an asset. I would buy it because of Pixie and Jennette. Buy this if you are a Pixie, Jennette, or VERY HARDCORE Fred Fan. Gets annoying after a while."
5,Awesome grill!,"I've only owned one grill in this range, but I've been quite pleased with it. Heats up quickly, holds temperature, and looks great. I was nervous about assembling something like this, but it turned out to be pretty easy. It took me and my father-in-law about 90 minutes to assemble, the instructions were very good. Save yourself the tax and delivery you'd pay by getting this in person and do it yourself!"
5,Top quality product - cooks great!,This product came un-assembled. It was boxed extremely well with no missing parts and good instruction. As with my previous Weber BBQ that I used for 15 years this is a high quality product.Best of all it cooks great!
4,Great Grill!,"I have had this grill for about 8 months and have been very happy with it. The only problem I have had is with the ignition switch. A AAA battery is used inside of the button that lights the grill. the button is not water tight, so any time it rains the battery area fills with water. After a few rains and me cleaning the switch and replacing the battery, the ignitor stopped working. Weber customer service is great and they sent me a replacement ignitor under warranty. I use my grill 3 - 4 times a month all year long so I don't normally like to hassle with a cover. But I guess I will have to or change the ignitor to a non battery operated type. Overall all great grill, but Weber needs to make the battery compartment water tight."
5,We love this BBQ,"I bought this for my husband. Boy was he surprised! It cooks very evenly, looks nice and is easy to start. We especially like not having to go out to buy propane. It was not difficult to connect to the gas source on the house. We BBQ almost every night now."
4,Weber E310 Overpriced,"We wanted to get this item from here but kept shopping around and found a great deal at a local store ($495). It had all the parts except the support for the two sides were plastic and the grill was not Stainless Steel. So, I will buy that later when the enameled grill gives out."
4,good science done in a place known for hysteria,"This video (Loch Ness discovered)presents the excellent science done in order to understand the ecology of Loch Ness. It shows that the lake (and limnology) is fascinating, regardless of whether there's a ""monster"" lurking in it. It also indicates that the lake COULD support a group of large, fish-eating creatures. Does it?--The video prudently doesn't go beyond its own good science to try to opine on that. The only sour note: the bogus conclusion of the psychologist, who opines that the ""revelatory"" attitude of witnesses makes the experience hallucinatory (the ones who aren't implicated as outright liars). Germans who went to hear Hitler in the 30's often had the same reaction, and it (unfortunately) didn't make HIM a hallucination! Unusual events are not reacted to in blase' fashion; and one feels sorry for the psychologist who needs the ""real"" world to be so terribly mundane."
4,Classic animation,"I bought this for the Doonesbury Special, but found myself delighted by the other pieces on the disc as well. Everybody Rides the Carousel is an exploration of the stages of life as defined by psychologist Erik Erikson. My Universe Inside Out is a self-portrait/creation story by Faith Hubley. All three shorts are wonderfully animated and voiced, and are a great introduction to the Hubleys' work if you're unfamiliar with it."
4,Heavenly,"The title should be changed to Heavenly, the most relaxing album I have heard in eons. Lyrics are mystical and backing vocals with Phil Collins are a wonderful fusion of voices. Any jazz/country/blues fan will have hours of delight with this one!"
1,"Great - if you want fuzzy, pockmarked walls","Nothing is worse than a roller cover that makes bubbles in your work, leaving behind thousands of microscopic craters when they pop and dry, except a cover that sheds its fibers. This does both.After picking enough fibers off the wet paint and rushing to the hardware store in search of a different brand before my paint dried, I looked on the package for the note ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back"". Guess what, there isn't any. Not only was this a time consuming and wasteful exercise, I had to sand the walls to cover the craters, free the fuzzies, and start again.I repainted with these:Wooster Brush R959-9 Painter's Choice Roller Cover 3/8 Inch Nap, 6-pack, 9 Inch. No bubbles, no fibers. Nice."
5,How to REALLY learn Java ....,"Buy this book!I bought several copies for my staff, many of whom are mainframe/COBOL programmers. Even after Sun training, many of them were still struggling with Objects and the Java class libraries.This was the book that turned on the light for most of them."
2,Not sure about this one...,"I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the book for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got worn down by the constant humor, margin notes, and bizarre analogies. I also found that trying to use this book as a reference was nearly impossible. When the book did have a clear answer to what I was looking for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest ""Learning Java"" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly)."
2,Head first? Not so fast....,"I buy a lot of techinical books and found this one to be missing the mark both on content and format. There was too much effort on dumbing down the information with pictures while trying to maintain the technical vocabulary of object oriented programming. This strange mixture of geek-bonics and unrelated graphics created a major disconnect between the graphics, text, and example codes.There are other books out there with more information and better formated for learning and for less money.I will be selling this book shortly.Joe"
4,Good first book to get excited about Java,"This is a good book to get you excited about the possibilities of the java language, including sound and GUI. And, you will have some fun doing it. But, once you go through the book, you will need to get another one, to server as a Java language reference."
4,A fresh look at Java,The book explains Java by using every day examples in life. Even thought the book has only a few examples of actual code.
5,A book about how to learn Java,"What is so good about this book is that it show you WHAT to learn about Java, but also HOW to learn it (how to learn anything, in fact). At the end of the book, beside knowing Java, you also have a better trained brain, and you actually feel more intelligent! A must read! You may expect the Head First concept to be applied outside of the computer world soon. If not, O'Reilly editors are completely missing the point..."
4,not too bad,"Not a bad little gadget although we are still learning how to use it. I like that it gives all the different definitions of the words. The only problem I have found so far is that the volume is very low without the headphones. I turned it up all the way and it is had to understand what they are speaking. With the headphones, it is much clearer and easier to understand."
1,A DISSATIFIED CUSTOMER,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCT. YOU SHOULD PULL IT OFF THE MARKET. READING THE SCREEN IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO READ; AND THE VOICE QUALITY IS A VERY BAD JOKE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, EVEN IF IT WAS BEING GIVING AWAY.IS THERE ANY WAY IN WHICH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK?THE SMALLS"
4,Translator with Sound,"Nice translator and small enough for the pocket. You can hear the sound of the word in Spanish and/ or English. At first, it is difficult to navigate so that you can hear the word pronounced in Spanish instead of English."
1,old technology,It is almost impossible to see the screen and the audio is very bad. Look for a newer product. I plan to give my unit away.
3,Franklin Merriam Webster Speaking Spanish English dictionary,I read the reviews and didn't take heed. Shame on me. It's difficult to read and the product is very disappointing.
3,It's very hard to read,It's very hard to read without the backlight and it shuts off after a very short time! I don't think it allows you to program the backlight duration. If you want to read anything you always have to be turning it back on! The vocabulary is limited compared to the Sharp PW E550 dictionary. The keyboard is not as comfortable as the Sharp. Its ok if you are not going to use it for a prolonged time. After some time you're fingers will get tired since the keyboard is somewhat compressed.
3,Pros and cons,"Pros: It has a pretty good amount of definitions. The touch screen is comfortable and the English pronunciations are fairly good. If what you are trying is to learn is English, this can be helpful as it was (and still is) to me.Cons: Unless you have the light on, the screen is hard to see. The Spanish pronunciations are terrible, awful. Spanish is my native language and believe me, not worth it. If you are looking for help with pronunciation in Spanish this item won't help you."
2,not what I expected at all,"This translator came in torn wrapping, which was taped closed. So,obvious that it was used. The item was supposed to be brand new in the original packaging. Yeah right! There was even dirt on the electronic dictionary and some of the adhesives have been peeled off leaving residue on the front and back of the item. And,the display lighting is very poor and in low light settings, it is nearly impossible to see the text. It comes with a talking option for pronuciation but the volume, even on max, is so soft, you need to hold it up to your ear to hear it. Look for some other spanish-english dictionary (It does not allow you to input phrases or sentences to transalte, but it does provide some useful phrases which are already stored in the item.)"
2,I was disappointed,"Franklin Merriam-Webster ((Speaking)) Spanish-English Dictionary (BES-1850). I really did not test it's functionality. From that stand point it might be fabulous but the fact that I could not read the display screen was sufficient for me to return the device. The letters are blue, the backround is light green. Even after adjusting the resolution I had problems reading the small letters. If you do not have perfect vision I would not recommend this unit."
2,Dim display is kiss of death,"I read reviews before I purchased. Some said the display was very dim. I took the risk. Wish I had not. It's really, really dim. So dim, it cannot be used outdoors. Recommend you look elsewhere"
1,Useless speaking Dictionary,Franklin Electronic Publishers BES-1890 Speaking Spanish-English DictionaryThis product did NOT provide a spoken translation from English to Spanish.The LED's were hard to see (black on gray) and lots of unneeded games.
2,Waste of money!,"1. Does not translate phrases, just words!2. Can barely read the text.3. Does not pronounce the Spanish word, just the English word!"
2,Sound barely audible,"I puchased this unit for my 7th grade daughter. The voice speaking the phrases was so soft, especially on the Spanish side, that we figured we got a broken one right out of the box. Franklin customer service promptly sent me a replacement, and I was shocked to see it has exactly the same problem -- even when the volume is turned up full you can barely hear the voice you are supposed to learn from. I called Customer Service again, thinking they must have heard about this problem before, but they said that must just be how the unit works, and they denied having had a lot of complaints about it. If that's true, I'm really surprised. The speaking function is a big disappointment, from the volume standpoint. I can't really comment on the unit otherwise, but I am quite disappointed by this Franklin product."
2,Upset,"Well, when I order this product the offer was very clear saying, including this & that & also in its original package. But, instead I got a used product with no package & the including this & that didn't come. So, I don't recommend this seller, unless you want to get screwed up too.Best wishes,Jose CruzFranklin Merriam-Webster Speaking Spanish-English Dictionary (BES-1850)"
2,Translator,The product is very good with a lot of resources. But unfortunatelly I can not see the word very well. The light is very weak.
4,Best span-engl dic out there for the price,I got this thing just yesterday and am impressed. But to the negatative side the screen brightness is not the greatest nether is the speaking but still is great! i love this thing w/the hookup to the computer this is a great buy go ahead!!!!!
3,A helpful tool,"[...]The translator is very nice; however, I would have liked a larger dictionary and I really didn't need the speaking option."
4,great to use anywhere!,"the product is exactly what you'd expect. you could carry it around anywhere and never feel at lost for a word. the only thing i could note as a setback was that it was everything i could expect.. and nothing more. the extra feature for adding on cards as word banks in other languages is great but not exactly an attractive option. something like an internet connection for updating would be more convenient BUT thats a irrelevant issue. if you need a pocket dictionary for the english and spanish languages, this product is well-priced and durable. highly recommended."
3,poor screen light,"I have been using a Franklin translator which I bought in 1995, it was a great machine. However, it has just worn out and is unable to be repaired. I have purchased the new Franklin and it has many feature that are poor in comparison to my old machine. The screen light is too dull, hard to read, and the keys are not as easy to use. Sometimes new is not better. The voice feature is a joke unable to understand."
1,Save your money,"I found the speech quality very very poor, and incorrect pronication of words. I typed in some of the instructions from the lid and found the translator did not translate correctly!Save your money and buy just a basic dictionary and take a beginner's class. They laugh at this product when I took it to Spain. They thought it was some kind of bad joke."
4,i love it but...,i love this product it works perfectly the only thing i don't like about it is that is too dark in the screen i have to always turn the lcd light on and i can see it clearly when i am outside the class and my hose the light makes too much glare.. i think the only problem would be the lcd scree is too dark but other than that it works perfectly
1,Not useful,"To begin with, the screen is so dull, even with backlight, that it is almost impossible to be seen indoors and impossible outdoors. You will not be able to type a word in and show it to someone as to get a particular product at the grocery story since they will not be able to see the screen. Even common words were not to be found and forget about phrases. Not to be recommended."
1,Won't speak.,"Mine would not speak, and I returned it. Has anyone got this product to speak?Also, instructions are a difficult to handle foldout, instead of a handy booklet."
1,Discouraged,Did not receive the ordered product. Received Merriman dictionary. Had to return product at my expense. Sent several emails to the sender with no reply.
1,Franklin BES-1850,"This Franklin product is not worth even looking at. It does not performed as advertised and you more time being frustrated then you will ever get any assistance. Franklin needs to decide whether it wants to be in today's technology and either be a PDA or pocket PC, or stop trying to compete in this market. Their products are misleading in advertising what they are supposed to be for, and really not even worth looking at for most fields. I believe you can do better with multiple other products that are more technologically advanced, and can meet today's needs and challenges. I would highly avoid this company's products in the future. It will just mean an extra drive to return it."
4,Functional,"The electronic speaking dictionary is practical, easy to go and wide in range of words and expressions."
1,Franklin Spanish dictionary,It may be a good dictionary but it is unreadable because of the dark green background. I have not been able to use it. Its a complete waste of money
1,It was a disaster,"I bought this product as a present, since I've one an it's great but me experience become a nightmare when the product arrived the speaker key didn't work so I requested an exchange being very expecific that a wanted a device that work appropriately and I had to pay for the return package, but I didn't complain thinking in my friend's present, and when finally the devices arrived, again they sent me one that did'd work this time was the light key, so I had to return the product agiain and paid again for the return package.....it was a disaster and I gave my friend other present"
1,Not as Advertised,"When items was received it was wrapped in bubble wrap without a box. The item did not work and it was apparent that it was a used item, not new as advertised."
2,Good translator but...,"The item arrived in a white little box instead of its original blister pack. No batteries, no headphones. The manual that came in the box looks like a photocopied letter-sized page. Otherwise the unit is perfect."
3,screen has huge glare,"Screen has big glare. The 4110 is a lot better because it is similar to a phone screen because it has a backlight on it that will stay on. This one has a backlight but isnt any good. You cannot see that the light is even on when there is average light out. Get the 4110 its definitely worth the extra money.For Pros, it is very easy to type the keys and rarely hit the wrong letter. It turns off and on fast which is nice when you are constantly looking up words."
2,Very good for an egotist,I am most dissapointed that this dictionary won't conjugate verbs beyond the first person singular..it has all the tenses alright but only in the one form which really doesn't give you a clue about how the third person plural might look or sound..I bought it thinking it would be the most complete translator around but find it very lacking and can't believe it's meant to be this way except that my friend has one and it's the very same..i would certainly reccommend this product to anyone who is a complete egotist and only wants to talk about me me me...otherwise better keep looking ....
1,Terrible,"The contrast is poor, and the screen background color is part of the problem - a dull grey, against which the purplish text strains the eyes. I fiddled with the contrast adjustment, and tried it with both the backlight on and off. I also expanded the text, but that allows too little of the text on the screen. The pronunciation of the ""speaking"" translator was sometimes good, sometimes poor. The control interface is clunky. Further, the French insert card worked, but the ""speaking"" part doesn't work with it. In my rating, I would have given the ""portability"" portion fairly high marks, but the other attributes were so poor, I did not want to encourage anyone else to take a chance on this.It's a waste of money. I remembered my Android phone, downloaded a free foreign dictionary app, and find it very satisfactory. I also am purchasing a hard-copy book for more expanded definitions and word usage."
1,Not suitable,"Overall was simply not useful. The audio part pronouncing the words was very low volume with no way to adjust, the phrases were nothing more than the typical tourist stuff, the display washed out in light."
1,The Franklin BES-1850 Is Unusable - AVOID at all costs!,"Franklin Merriam-Webster ((Speaking)) Spanish-English Dictionary (BES-1850)The Franklin BES-1850 is, in my opinion, totally unusable. This is because it is impossible to see the words or icons on the screen. The writing (and icons) are a darkish blue color on a darkish green background. Try this combination on your word processor and you will see what I mean. The picture of the product on the Amazon.com website gives you the impression that it has black writing on a white background but this is not the case. In addition, the speaking voice is distorted, unclear, and the volume is too low. I don't see how Franklin could possibly put this product on the market, and especially at a suggested list price of $129.00! I would give this unit zero stars but the lowest you can give is 1 star. Don't bother with this product even if you get it for free. PH 110101"
1,Product not up to expectations,"The contrast on the screen was so poor that we coulen't read our results. I have an earlier Franklin product that reads very easily, so this was a big disappointment. I spoke with Franklin as suggested and they felt that the machines (we bought 2) had been improperly stored and wouldn't function correctly. We have returned both of them as we couldn't read the screens. The machine functions very well, we just couldn't read it. Very disappointing!"
1,You'll be sorry...,"I purchased this to help me learn Spanish, and I will say, even though I got it cheap, its not worth it. First, the screen is so dark and has such low contract, its almost impossible to read without the backlight. And the backlight turns off after a few seconds.Then there is the speech. The volume is so low, its very hard to hear. The speaker is about 1/2"" wide, so to say the sound is bad is an understatement.So, other than the fact that you can't see it or hear it, is it good? Nope. I thought that a device which costs this much could at least translate a sentence. This one can't. Words only. There are some canned phases, but you have to search for what you want and most are pretty useless. Like for example ""I'm in hotel room 10"" O.K. But what happens if your in 345?This thing may give you and your Spanish friends a good laugh, but not much more than that."
5,Excellent Product!,"I bought this same model about eight years ago and used it almost on a daily basis. I was so upset when I lost my dictionary so I needed a new one. I was debating on buying the newer model but from reading the reviews, I didn't like the fact that the built-in cover and backlight were not available on the new model so I rebought this model. I was also thrilled that this same model is still manufactured. I love this electronic dictionary. I have never had an instance where a word I needed wasn't available. I love the full verb conjugation feature, and it also pronounces the words via a speaker. You can adjust the volume and the backlight can be set to be on for a long time. I love reading material in Spanish and this dictionary is always by my side to look up words quickly versus using a paper dictionary. Also, you can save words you don't know and test yourself later. This dictionary also has a calendar and clock built in."
2,warning,"The second episode on this volume is a ""rehash"" episode. If you've been watching this series so far you know there isnt much story to rehash. I watch this series for the quirky villains and the occasional moment of sublime action (and even rarer, drama) which these three episodes have but for some reason (the cheap animation getting repetitive along with the storylines?) just arent as much fun as in the previous volumes."
5,HOOD BOOGAS!!!!,HA!!!! NOW THAT WAS WHAT I CALL AN EDUCATIONAL VIDEO!!!! BEWARE OF DEM HOOD BOOGAS CAUSE DEM IS ON THE PROWL AND READY TO CATCH YA WIT YA PANTS DOWN!!!! GOOD JOB EVERYONE!
5,Long awaited,I have been waiting for this album since I saw the band at a Story of the Year concert almost two years ago. I bought their 5 song album at the show and loved it. I got this cd and it is fantastic. Each song has a unique sound and the vocals are different with every song as well. I feel that they will become one of the more popular underground rock bands out there within a few years.
3,I found their music to be rather average and dull,"The GoodDriving riffs and resonating licks set the pace for ""Barricade the Doors."" Vocalist Rob Tweedie has a good melodic tone without coming off too whiney. Tweedie mixes melody with emotional outbursts on the mid-tempo track ""I Buried My Heart in Cosmo Part."" ""Folding and Unfolding"" focuses more on vocals than instrumentation. ""The Diamond Ring"" has a nice flow to it with its smooth rhythm changes and slow building crescendo. The riffs get heavier and the licks get more prevalent on ""The Ghosts of Who We Were.""The BadAdair can construct a decent song, but no matter how many times I listen to them, I just can't get into them. The lyrics tend to go over your head, and there's no repetition with the music.The VerdictAdair are a great bunch of guys and are passionate about what they do. Unfortunately, I found their music to be rather average and dull."
3,Less zing than most,"This Zinger is blander than most of them, which was disappointing. I have to use twice the bags to brew the same strength of cup that, say, the cranberry apple zinger gives me. I like the taste very much, when I do double-bag, it's a lovely, tangy orange taste; but I expected better of a Celestial Seasonings zinger tea."
4,An Excellent Summary of Spiritual Basics,"When I first read this book more than 30 years ago, I was very impressed by its clarity. It covers all of the basics of spirituality, albeit it a once-over-lightly fashion.Then later I found a revision by the author which was totally different, and in my opinion, not nearly as impressive. I contacted the author about this and didn't get much of an explanation other than his thinking changed--apparently because he was influenced by Kriya Yoga teachings, which he later became involved in. Although I have nothing against Kriya Yoga, I very much liked the simple, straightforward approach of the first edition of TS&C.Inerestingly, when you search on Roy Eugene Davis, Time, Space and Circumstance isn't listed, although several out of print books are."
1,Software problems,"I bought this software, but it won't run on my Win XP system. The 16 bit software doesn't want to install; it took three tries to get it done. Then the software hung on startup in normal, Win 2000, and Win 95 compatability mode. When I tried to uninstall it, I discovered it had no uninstall routine. While I love J. Vernon McGee, I don't recommend this software. Buy the books instead."
2,Age gap far too disturbing,"Boy is this book a trashy romance. Near child virgin bride coerced into marriage/buisness merger to appease her ailing grandfather--to 13 years her senior very experienced man with a permanent mistress. Nena was an enjoyable character, her innocence and her strength of character were well portrayed, I just didn't like Ramon that much. His mother admits he has had his way too much, and Nena attempting to tell him that just ends in him being more convinced that he must always take the lead in everything.Its a quick read and isn't out and out throw across the room disguisting/disturbing. But the more I think about the age and expereince gap between these two the more I am disturbed by their union. It just didn't sit right with me."
4,Very Exciting Plot!,"After reading Montanari's excellent fourth and latest novel of suspense, The Rosary Girls, I decided to read his second thriller, The Violet Hour. The Violet Hour is a tale of serial terror and revenge that is mostly chilling and powerful. It is a very good book and clearly demonstrates the potential that was fulfilled in The Rosary Girls. The plot is exciting and well developed and moves along at a steady pace, which will make you want to keep turning the pages. The characters, however, are somewhat thinly deveolped and, without going into detail, some of the situations that occur are a bit implausible. Nevertheless, these criticisms are far overshadowed by the suspense generated by a very talented writer. I'm looking forward to reading Montanari's new book, The Skin Gods, which will be in the bookstores tomorrow."
5,"Author offers a second dose of smart, erotic goosebumps.","When Richard Montanari's DEVIANT WAY hit bookstores a few years back, authors like Kinky Friedman were calling it ""amazing."" When Simon & Schuster VP and editor Chuck Adams lost Montanari to Avon, he called it Simon & Schuster's considerable loss, Avon's obvious gain.THE VIOLET HOUR proves Chuck Adams right.Once again, Montanari has created an erotically charged thriller that never once slips into the sticky paged realm of gratuitous or sleezy. Monty knows how to write a slime drenched maniac without sacrificing the integrity of his work to the stench. Perhaps it's the strength of his time tattered heroes that, in part, explains his ability to maintain the delicate balance.THE VIOLET HOUR is top notch suspense at the hands of a new and promising master. Keep your eye on Montanari. Rising stars are always a joy to observe.Kelly Milner Halls, Remote Staff, The Book Report, AOL"
1,Rip Off Alert!!!,"Unfortunately none of the 3 prior reviews alerted me to the fact that these are very inferior remakes of some great songs. There is some nearly microscopic small print on the cover that says that these are ""new stereo rerecordings by the original artist"" which is a euphemism for crappy remakes."
3,Mom's favorite song,Mom heard this song at church on Father's Day and loved it. We didn't know who sang it but I researched it until I found out it was Holly Dunn. I had to get this CD for her. She cries every time she listens to it because it reminds her so much of her relationship with her father.
2,Not what you thought!,This CD is all instrumental. It doesn't have any of the good songs that were in the movie!
2,need some help?,So apparently this album dosn't have any of the goood music from the movie which is highly dissapointing. There is a cover of Steve Miller's Rock N' Me in the movie and perhaps some of you are looking for this cover. It is done by an artist Shayne Blue and the album is called Goodbye. For some reason I had a hard time trying to find the title Theodore which must be the group name. Try ... or seach amazon for Shayne Blue. The album is alright and has 3-4 good songs besides Rock N' Me.
5,Bed tray table,I love this bed tray. I didn't know that the center section tips up at various positions for reading. This thing does everything I need it to do and it isn't too heavy for as much as there is to it. I LOVE THIS BED TRAY! It was worth every cent I paid!
3,the shape of you and other things,The book the shape of me and other stuff is about the shape of you and things around you. It teaches you that there is nothing the same shape. The age level for this book would be threeto five. This book was good but it would be better for three to five year olds.
1,Not for babies under 2,"I don't recommend this book as a beginning shapes book. Most of the illustrations are basic black. I love Dr. Seuss, but this book is very boring. My 7-1/2 month old son doesn't care for this book as much as he enjoys ""Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You?"" and other Dr. Seuss books."
5,Held the interest of my three year old,"It was his favorite book until he memorized it from cover to cover over a couple weeks of daily reading! He has moved on to others now but still likes to read this one once in a while.This is a typical 'shapes' book, but only in Dr. Seuss fashion.You see your toddler presented the 'regular' / geometric shapes all the time but here (s)he is opened up to a world of diversity in shapes.I guess this one can give them an early cue about not getting 'boxed' in!"
4,A nice visual change from some of the other books.,"This book seems to work at two levels: For the youngest (<1) children, the contrasting silhouettes provide an interesting thing to focus on while you read the text. (The theory being that infants won't have fully developed their eyesight, but can be ""stimulated"" by high contrasting patterns.) Slightly older (1-2 1/2) have fun identifying the shapes towards the end of the book.Whereas the ""Mr Brown can Moo"" book emphasizes aural development, this focuses on visual. My toddler seems to enjoy it, although ""One Fish"" still ranks higher."
3,Not quite my favorite,"Dr. Seuss, of course, was extremely prolific. What this means for me is that some of his books I *adore*, but some I'm ambivalent about. This book is definitely in the latter category.It's very easy for beginning readers to read, though."
4,Accidentally got this from Amazon but LOVE IT!,"I ordered Eddie Higgins ""Those Quiet Days"" but got a CD that had Higgins on the side label, but Kenny Werner on the front. The CD inside was Werner. I gave it a listen and was really impressed by the laid back kind of semi fusion, jazzy interpretations that were presented. In a word I would say it was 'cool... man cool with an edge'. Lots of feeling with a certain amount of boldness that really works well. Very original and imaginative pieces gave me special enjoyment. Now I will look to purchase some more of this chaps work."
3,I agree with mayfayre,"I did not care for this book. I thought Emma spent too much time waffling back and forth between being independent and a sniveling, unreasonable martyr. The mother's actions were embarrasing - I have seen women cope with death, including suicide, and never abandon their families as Rose did. I wanted Matt to slap the both of them, and then slap himself for putting up with them. I thought the ending was vague and unsatisfying. I love Ms. Woods's books, but this was not one of her better ones."
3,Don't Let the Pretty Cover Fool You,"Don't let the bright pink cover fool you into believing this is a lighthearted story.. it's not. The main storyline and the characters' interactions are a result of a suicide. The book is sold as a Cheers bar-like story, but there was no real similarity. I had anticipated hearing stories from within the diner and meeting up with a lot of locals and townspeople, but that really wasn't the case. The focus was less on the interactions at the diner and more on discovering if the suicide was accidental or not. I have read a few Sherryl Woods books and this one is remarkably similar to the others - the characters are so-so the romance is minimal at best, and the writing is better than a cheap Harlequin but not as involving as a real story should be. I was disappointed but would still recommend it to fans."
2,Flamingo Diner,"Look this is just to sad for me to love . I love Sherryl Woods books , but it took me for ever to read . I will say it did have a happy ending !"
4,Good product,"For the first week of taking this product it caused upset stomach symptoms, shakiness, and trouble with sleeping. However, that was only the first week. Now I feel alert and energized all day after taking this product. No more upset stomach or trouble sleeping. I have yet to see if it is helping me lose weight though."
1,SAN Tight,Did not take this supplement contained lead chemical element. I wander if I bought a counterfeit from Amazon. I would had liked to try this product do to my plateau.
5,An excellent primer for the beginning collector.,"Yumoto's work was one of my first books on Japanese swords. Over twenty years later I still refer to it as a quick reference. While not a comprehensive reference it is nonetheless broad and nothing short of expert on the subject. Compared to more voluminous references, it is easily taken on the road while in search of these evasive art treasures."
3,confused...,"I finished reading it yesterday. It is too much for beginner and not enough for intermediate or even expert...It is definitely usefull for future reference in terms of finding more about your sword or swords you want to buy and using some of the criterias. Photos are B&W; and crappy and references text-to-drawings are badly organized.What is strongly missing is types of sword damage, how to eveluate type of damage and find it on blades etc...I dont know when book was written but some information also seems bit obsolete...If the book was hardcover, had two times more pages, colored photos to go with drawings, better organized and have more information, I would give 5. Now I give 3 of 5."
4,"Samurai Sword, A Handbook",The book is an excellent reference book on the sword. Detailed descriptions are backed up with plenty of pictures.
5,Autistic Children,This book was purchased to help learn the basics. It has helped calm the behavior of a child who loves the pressure and responds with a thank you.
2,Chiropractics,"This is another Upledger book which lacks insight into the Source of all health. There is a limited amount of insight and once he understands HOLY Spirit, it can become a very good book."
3,"Great Author, Great Therapy, but the content is deep.",I had to have this book for my class I took under the Upledger Institute. It is very hard to grasp and understand. But love the author and the course.
1,No real scientific evidence,"I had a massage therapist try this once when I thought I was going for a normal massage after getting whiplash, so I didn't get a chance to read about it first. There is no hard scientific evidence that this is real. People need to make sure to read both sides of the argument. You have to wonder why there are more scientific journals against it than for it."
5,Excellent,"An excellent volume on basic CranioSacral Therapy presented in understandable terms. The book was in perfect, new condition."
4,Transcending age and genre,"The 'Utters once again shatter the paradigms of punk by penning diverse songs chroniciling the lives of soul searchers, all supported by memorable melodies and diverse instrumentation.Bay Area laureates continue spinning the yarn and leave us all with engaging tales of fatalistic images of futility, soured romances, growing in a world that they believe they're outcasted from, and alcohol soaked nights.Youth Brigade remain true to their DIY beliefs after all these years and prove they still have what it takes to write some kick butt tracks. Let The Know pays homage to all those who've been there for them through the years. Long live BYO! as celebrated in a new documentary film."
2,Not Really,This product didn't really do much for me. I suggest TING which has a much better antibiotic ingredient.Cheers to summer time ! and all that goes with it.mj
1,Not really performance...,"Project #1: How to Raise your Car Up.Project #2: How to Change Your Oil.Project #3: How to Change Your Belt.And this goes on...This is stuff that's in your owners manual, and the manual has more info and comes free with the car. Plus, raising your car should not be listed as a 'performance' project, and if changing the oil gives you a bunch more HP, you might want to look for the 2 lbs of metal in the bottom of your oil pan.Most worthless book ever."
2,"Some good info, but...","I was disappointed with this book because it lacked a lot of detail thet would make the projects easier to complete. Also, the author spent way too much time explaining why the mods would not have any possitive results. If that is the case, why are they in the book?There are a few pearls of wisdom but they are few."
1,Over $250 Wasted,"So, I bought the Kit, a number of additional sensors, and even the Repeater/Range Extender.With everything sitting on a table it works. So I programmed everything and installed it. Everything seemed to work fine. Just a bit sluggish.After 24 hours I had to reprogram ALL the sensors. After another 24 hours and nothing worked again. And so all I get now is a constant voice alert that my sensors have all failed.And it won't let me go into programing mode anymore.So... Since I threw out all the boxes, and installed everything with double stick tape, It's not returnable.Stay away for this product, far away.Needs a rating of 0, but the selection doesn't go that low.On a technical side, I took apart one of the door sensors and it uses the same technology and frequencies as a lot of Chinese technology. IE: ""eBay Strobe Triggers"". You can expect a lot of interference with these."
4,Worked as described,"This product worked as intended, and fit my 1918 enfield almost perfectly. As stated in the product description, some modification of the stock has to be done to make it fit perfectly. The fore stock fit perfect without any need for modification. The butt stock required a little filing to get it to fit flush with the assembly."
5,Perfect fit,The Advanced Technology International Remington 87- Talon Shotgun Scorpion Pistol Grip 12-Gauge stock was a perfect fit for my shotgun. Great product! I would highly recommend this product!
2,not what i thought,"got this for christmas.it is not as good as i thought it would be in helping to solve crossword puzzles. Since I don't play Scrabble, guess it might help those with words but finding an answer to, ""What is the name of Zeus's wife?"" is what I thought it would do. Guess I should read more of the description before I purchased it. It is also NOT a dictionary.maril"
3,Franklin CWP-206 Crossword Puzzle Solver,Invaluable tool for crossword puzzles. It makes cheating a lot more fun.. :-)
3,Great Puzzle Helper,"This is a great little tool for all you puzzle solvers out there. I've had mine for quite some time now, and I use it all the time. The only negative thing about it is the cover does not stay attached to the base. This is my only complaint."
2,Meyecro Mossberg Big Game Cleaning Set,"The set looks nice in the picture, but when it arrives you can see just how cheap it looks. The quality and ease of use are terrible. The hunters in my family won't use these tools."
2,"Produc Description Wrong. ""We'll prepay the shipping cost.""","Hello, I followed the recommendations, and I called first. I asked about the pre-paid envelope, and they told me that I have to pay the shipping cost. The plan doesn't cover any shipping fee, so if the product breaks, I have to pay the shipping fee to send it to them.The description of this replacement plan says, ""If your product breaks, you can return it to us for replacement. We'll prepay the shipping cost..."""
1,"50 minutes, 52 seconds on Hold","I was on hold 50 minutes, 52 seconds before anybody answered. I heard ""your call is important to us"" at least 100 times, which wasn't very convincing."
1,Prior unpleasant experience with this company,"Last year, I purchased a replacement plan for my third Tungesten E2 PDA --a true piece of necessary junk -- after my second unit mafuntioned. I was informed that I had purchased the ""wrong"" plan. While Amazon eventually replaced the unit for me, not the warranty company, I now purchased the ""correct"" plan (dollar amount coverage was the factor in it being deemed the incorrect plan). The only way for me to really let all of you know if this replacement plan is any good is for me to wait for my third Tungsten E2 to fail, which it will, hopefully during the covered period. The company states that it is not an ""insurance"" plan -- so we will have to wait & see. The problem with Amazon reviews is that after you submit the review and two or three months have elapsed, you cannot amend your review to let readers know what has gone wrong -- you may only withdraw it completely."
1,Where is it ????,"Purchased this on 6-10-09 for a GPS and still have not received anything!! No email, no documents, NOTHING. RIPOFF!! I would give it a zero if I could."
4,"So Far, So Good...","I purchased a Waterproof Camera from Amazon, and was unsure about getting the 2-Year Replacement Plan warranty. I called the toll-free number for the Replacement plan and spoke with a customer service rep after just a few rings!She explained that I didn't have to buy both the camera and the warranty at the same time...I had up to 30 days to decide and purchase the warranty. That was nice to hear, so after I received the camera, I went ahead and purchased the plan. I hope I never have to use it, but it's a small price to pay to know that I am protected!"
4,Replacement contract,I received the 2 year replacement contract in a timely manner. The cost of the contract seemed reasonable. Hopefully I will not have to use the contract but if I do I ahould be protected.
1,Fran,This was not a paperbook and only had nine pages of written word. The rest of the pages were blank.
2,Childrens Red Riding Hood,Reading this book on Kindle and the stories are so fast that it is like not reading them at all. I guess I should have left this on alone. Of course it was a freebie.
4,Great Book Last Great Edition!,"I previously enjoyed the Guiness Book of World Records for many years, in bed before sleep marveling at the fattest human beings, the longest fingernails, toenails, moustaches etc. Long about 1980, the accountants got to Guiness. Instead of publishing the paperback with thousands of entries, Guiness instead started publishing a slick and thin ""gift book"" with only a few catagories. Gone are the days of page upon page of wonderful facts about our ability to measure and compare things.If you wish to own the last REAL Guiness Book of World Records, then this is the one."
5,Overlooked Masterpiece,"Though Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, and Mulholland Drive were all nominated for Oscars, Lost Highway, in many respects, stands as THE standard for Lynch films. Through its use of highly stimulating visuals, intriguing plot, abstract characterization, and philosophical, as well as psychological, insight, this work stands as, not only as one of Lynch's best, but one of the best filmatic achievements in the latter part of the 20th century. The film was immensely cut, however the script is here in its entirety. The script clarifies a lot of the lose ends of the visual work. A must-have for any Lynch fan."
1,for Lynch fans only,"The 5 star ratings could only have come from hardcore Lynch fans. This movie is absolutely unwatchable from start to finish. I am a longtime student of film, but have absolutely no clue what this movie is about. I challenge anyone who is not a lynch fan to comprehend this film. I have enjoyed most of Lynch's past work, but in lost highway I get the impression that he was trying too hard."
3,"Sorry Amazon, but there's a critical omission in presenting this potentially attractive item","I am a big baroque fan. The baroque period has produced by far the most and and many of the most memorable concerti for the oboe. As such, I'm amazed that I missed the collection when it was first issued in 1995.But now let's get serious: where are the composer's names linked to the audio samples? Was it a tease to test the knowledge of the cognoscenti - or was it just a mistake in setting up the web page?Obviously my rating of three stars is just a placeholder because I didn't get enough information to buy the recording."
1,Baroque Mess,"It could just be that I am not very fond of Baroque music. I especially despise the harpsichord in pretty much any setting. However, there are a few composers during this period that I thought I enjoyed, but not the renditions on this album. I bought this several years ago because I really enjoyed ""Beethoven at Bedtime"" by the same company. That album had some arrangements of Beethoven that I have heard no where else and now define my impression of those pieces. Unfortunately, this Baroque album did nothing for me. I just ran across the album going through boxes in my basement and gave it away because I have no desire to listen to it ever again."
5,Wonderful strong stuff,"This CD is well worth the price. Mocidade has arguably the best bateria in Rio de Janeiro. This material is all original and professionally performed and recorded.It is very strong medicine, if you are not used to batucada, and you have to listen several times to understand the intricacy and incredible power in this music. Batucada descended from Afro-Brazilian roots and was used in their religious ceremonies for hundreds of years -- after it's played for hours the Orisha's (Afro-Brazilian deities) appear and take hold of the participants, as they may well do for you, too, after you listen to this CD a few times. This is world class rhythm."
3,interesting,"Lots of names. There is a lot of information in this book. I found it to be lacking in its dealing with Allied/Soviet relations leading up to and during the war. He really only brings up the conflict over Poland at the end of the war. He skips over anything related to why the U.S. takes a ""firm"" stance against Russia. What he writes is very thin. If you bring up that topic have some information about it in the book. The author seems to say that the real impetus for dropping the bombs was a post war leveraging tool against Russia which did not really work thus instigating an arms race / cold war. The book makes you think which is good. It really needs background on the entire political dealings with the Big Three and events that took place during the war between them."
5,I'm in Love,"When I first heard these recordings they were a radio simulcast and I recorded them on tape. I lost the tapes and several years later I thought I had found the recording, but it was by the academy of ancient music. For over 28 years I have been dissaopointed that I didn't have my tapes because I thought the CDs just didn't have the same quality. Today I was looking again for the music as I lost my CDs and I was on youtube and I found this recording which I instantly realized is the original recording that I had back in 82. I was dumbfounded. I have made love to this recording for over half my life in my mind, and now I can finally have it. Thank you Trevor and thank you Amazon. I am in Heaven."
5,Excellent!! Really drives home the point: GOD is real!!,"Some people just don't want to believe in the existence of a real, all-powerful, living GOD. This book hits them point blank in the face and they don't like that. It's well written, well researched, and reads easy. There is software available that will allow you (the skeptic) to test the validity of the Bible codes, but don't buy it. You might just find out that the Bible is real and Grant Jeffrey is right on track. In any case, the book is an excellent addition to the library of the serious Christian who's seeking to know more about Jesus. And for those of you who don't believe, you will, sooner or later. Two thumbs up!!"
2,Not what it's made out to be.....,"The book sounds like it would have some interesting things about Hidden Bilbe Codes and secret codes and stuff, right? Wrong! It goes into great detail about the stuff that you really dont care about, and the interesting stuff is very vague. It just doesn't say what you wanna read about."
2,A Hilarious Read!,"Grant Jeffery has produced a book so unrooted in adademic research and logical reasoning, that his book is wildly hilarious! Jeffery's sources include the Encyc. Britannica, the Reader's digest, and Cinemax 2. His arguments for God's authorship of the Bible, and God's existence include: (1) Jewish people believe in God, and they are a clever people, therefore God exists. (2) The remains of the Tower of Babel are vitrified, and only God can do that (yes, but, Mr. Jeffery, where IS this huge lump of glass in the desert?) (3) Sombody ELSE said that language was given to man by God. (4) The probability of Old Testament prophecy and New Testament ""reality"" correlating is remote (aside the fact that the writers of the bible are writing from a tradition). All in all, I laughed heartily on almost every page (so 2 stars)! I invite you to join ""Dr."" Jeffery as he uses his Concordance and his computer to PROVE GOD!"

1,Poor research,"I saw Mr. Jefferey pushing his book on TV. He made the claim that the Bible is true because it says it's true. (he then cited a verse to prove this) Well, I can assure you his book is based on this same flawed research method. He points to encyclopedias, anonymous quotes, and the Readers Digest as valid research sources.I teach a class on research and frequently cite Mr. Jefferey's book as an example of poor research--especially his lack of sources. Those that have researched biblical errancy--even on the topical level--will see that this book does little to help the pro-Bible argument."
3,good info worth the price of the book,found parts of the book extremely interesting. filed away a few nuggets for future reference. other parts are repetetive and some run on but i am glad i read it and have passed it on. worth the price.
3,Not again...,"OK, if you read HANDWRITING OF G-D, you don't need to read this one, too. It does have good, unique information, but not enough to justify buying the book. Borrow it from a friend, if you can, or, better yet, get the two pack and save a buck. It wasn't a bad read, just repetitive. See my review of HANDWRITING OF G-D for more details about the content of both books."
1,Need a laugh?,"I saw Mr. Jefferey pushing his book on TV. He made the claim that the Bible is true because it says it's true.

Those that have researched biblical errancy--even on the topical level--will see that this book does little to help the pro-Bible argument."
4,Timely Interpretation of Current Events,"I picked this up after reading Britt Gillette's ""Conquest of Paradise"" which really turned me on to learning more about biblical prophecy of the end times. ""The Signature of God"" brings out facts that are very interfaith. Mr. Jeffrey sheds light on the accuracy of the Bible and its incredible history of transmission. Far from being the rare, locked away, or haphazard work that some would have us believe, the Bible is a document that seems almost alive with its ability to survive enemies. Great job Grant!"
2,Is this information accurate?,"This book definitely caught my attention with the bible codes. However after some inverstigation i am sure that many of the claims Grant Jeffries makes are inaccurate and unsubstantiated. For example he goes on and on about the chances of a certain ELS being found in the bible but does not use any control, for example, how do we know that any other word does not have the same chance of being in that ESL? The examples that were shown for the number seven were also filled with errors, these errors are previously mentioned in another review posted here."
3,I am convinced but the book did not help,"I have written extensively on the Bible codes myself and thus need no convincing from Grant Jeffrey. Unfortunately, his book is so poorly edited that I doubt anyone could be convinced by anything he says. The spellings of names change from one place on the page to another; Isaiah 48:1 is quoted once and then referred to on the next page as Isaiah 48:11; and the famous Professor Stephen Jay Gould is repeatedly referred to as Dr. Gold. Could we please read our work before publishing it, or does Mr. Jeffrey just assume that the public is a complete bunch of ignorami who are not worth the extra few minutes' review?"
3,OK but late in arriving,This book was supposed to be part of a Christmas gift but by the time it arrived it was so close to Christmas that I had already bought a replacement gift. I will say the seller did inform me it was going to be delayed; that was considerate.
2,not very good..,after hearing about this book for years i had to buy and read it. im very dissapointed. this books dry and winded.
5,Evolution is a good thing.,"I know many diehard Locust fans will say that they sold out and became mainstream when they released this album, but the truth is this was their most well-rounded album. Even though Safety Second, Body last is my favorite this one showed a certain level of dedication to their craft which the others did not. This wasn't a cookie-cutter grindcore/experimental power violence cd and I can't wait for their next one."
4,excellent read,"charles tart has written many books on the consciousness and human potential. this is a fascinating and very practical book on psychological growth. the book covers a variety of topics such as lucid dreaming, psychic phenomena, psychological growth, meditation and death. the meditation section provides a variety of explanations and techniques used for meditating. like many of his previous books, mr. tart goes into a lot of detail about altered states of consciousness. although it tends to be some dry reading, it still is a very rewarding read. i highly recommend this book if you are into transpersonal psychology."
5,Melungon Ancestry,I really enjoyed watching this video. It helped give me new ideas and paths to follow in researching my family's history which at best has been elusive.The video was entertaining as well as informative.
2,Where's Charles?,"Boo! These Fethering mysteries are way below par. What makes Brett's other work so great is the wit and polish of writing and the great characterization. Neither quality is apparent in this series. The two main characters are shallow stereotypes of the middle-class civil servant and the free spirit who have somehow come together over an interminable glass of white wine. To compare these to a Miss Marple is ludicrous. This one is particularly inane...the deep, dark family secret, the weak nephew, the vicious do-gooder, the ambitious administrator, the self-important bureaucrat, the unprincipled American academic (by the way, Americans do not pronounce ""God"" as ""Gard""), the escaped convict and even the handicapped child! Please. Can we have more Charles Paris? Less white wine and more Bell's??"
3,Jude and Carole meet the world of letters.,"MURDER IN THE MUSEUM by Brett Simon represents a series that is on a downhill slide. The characters of Jude and Carole as the free spirit and the uptight widow woman are becoming rather cloying.The other characters in the novel seem to arrived for a dart board selection of stereotypes so that they become charactertures instead of characters. How many do you need to make a point.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,oregon is bad,"i like to drive around with the cd in and pretend i'm driving through the various states when i'm really just trying to drive in unfamiliar parts of my neighborhood that look like they could be states different than the one i'm in.i should note that linnell put on a good show at the troubador, too. i hope he returns soon with more state songs..."
4,Essential for a TMBG fan,"I treat this CD as another TMBG album. It's very similar in every aspect. I love all their other albums, and this one fits right in. It's not a classic, like Flood and Apollo 18 are to me. Nor do I think it is as good as their first 2 or Factory Showroom. I think, like John Henry, this album has a lot of fantastic moments and a few mediocre tracks. Nevada is a dissappointment, as most of it is dominated by the sound of a parade recorded out the window of the studio. Idaho is very un-TMBGish, as it isn't really that good. Utah is experimental, with a band organ, but it lacks something, I think. The good songs, though, are really good. Songs of the 50 States, West Virginia, South Carolina, Montana, PA, and Maine all could have appeared on a TMBG album and certainly belong on any Giants mix tape you make. If you own all of They Might Be Giant's albums, you'll love this. But if you are still lacking a TMBG album, I'd get itbefore I got this one."
5,More great music from part of the music genius called TMBG.,"Looking back to six years ago, I remember being 14, and getting my first TMBG CD, John Henry. A few of my friends had raved about this group I had never heard of, and I finally decided to give them a chance. The music grew on me, in all aspects: lyrics, harmony, originality, all the things that TMBG presents that few of today's popular musicians and songwriters can even come close to matching. Since then, I have bought all of TMBG's albums, several singles, both CDs by Mono Puff, and now State Songs.I have yet to be disappointed by the work of the Johns, and will support their music as long as they continue to make it, and longer. John Linnell has outdone himself with this package of creative songs that just happens to involve states. I love this CD, and it will be my favorite collection of songs about states, at least until Linnell turns out volume 2. I can't wait! Hey John, how about a song for Ohio?"
2,Rather boring,"Quite frankly, I found this release rather boring. I am a big TMBG fan, but this one doesn't stack up. I really like South Carolina, Maine, and Song of the 50 States, but the rest is just average to me. The instrumental stuff is somewhat satisfying, except for the last track, which is a throwaway and should not have been included. I would have preferred more upbeat polka-esque stuff. Now I'm really looking forward to the next TMBG, since this did not satisfy me."
4,Absurd brilliance,"Not unlike They Might Be Giants' work generally, John Linnell's State Songs are catchy, silly, often absurd, clever and witty. Not surprisingly, the songs have only marginal connections to their subjects. The best song on the album, ""South Carolina,"" for instance, is about a person who gets injured in a bike accident and sues (someone) for money damages. As an attorney, I found this one most humorous -- spot on -- as the bike accident victim has a neighbor take photos of his injuries, describes the police clearing the accident scene, and tells of winning ""punitive"" damages in court. ""Maine"" has a funny chorus:MaineIs the world that went southMaineIs a punch in the mouthMaine at the top of the chartHas crushed my evil heartMaineIs the devil you knowMaineIs the heaven belowMaineAt the top of the chartHas crushed my evil heartAnd so goes most of the rest of the songs.If you're a fan of TMBG, State Songs is a must for your collection."
4,Way out on a limb.,"You probably shouldn't pick this one up unless you are a serious TMBG fan. It's even weirder than they usually are but, most of these songs are good. It's great to see some originality for a change. Very quirky musically with hilarious and subtle lyrics. The Bruce Richardson review is so idiotic I'm tempted to think John Linell submited it as a joke. It would be perfect. South Carolina ranks with any of the best TMBG songs. State Songs, Montana, Arkansas, Michigan, and Maine are other favorites. There are 4 or 5 songs on this disc that haven't connected yet but there is still time."
5,Mendelssohn Cto E m by Viktoria Mullova (Philips),"Not much of a reviewer per se but have listened to CD recordings of Mendelssohn's piece by at least half dozen or so classical artists including venerable Menuhin. Xue-Wei takes honors for most delicately beautiful rendition, but Viktoria's is most bright-almost brilliant, vibrant, with the deft parambuco. Isaac Stern played it like a master on Sony Classical. Vikki's is the Gold-Standard--when one recalls the music, one cannot help but remember that her performance is THE way it should be."
5,Pure musical creativity!,"This album is a perfect example of what POS music is all about. An unpredictable prog masterpiece. Gildenlow's vocals are awesome, Langell tears it up on the drums, and Johan Hallgren's solos give me goose bumps. You may not drop over until 3 or 4 listens, but you will drop over! This is one of their best!"
4,"Beatrix = excellent, sound quality =terrible!","Beatrix Potter was an enigmatic, diversely talented individual. This is an excellent video. It's too bad the sound quality is so bad."
5,"Toast, by Nigel Slater","This was a gift to someone from England. He loved reliving some of his own childhood memories through it!I felt lucky to get it through Amazon.com, as it is currently out of print. It was rather expensive to send in time for Christmas, but the reaction was worth it."
2,"Oh, please!","Do not put this writer in the ranks of Reichl, Bourdain, or Child. Mr. Slater may write well enough, but he has essentially nothing to say. I grew tired of the endless lists of British candies and other treats that had no relevance for me as an American. I kept waiting to be won over, but the author evokes no foodie buzz, at least for this reader. Perhaps I wouldn't have been so disappointed if the book hadn't been so hyped. Read Julie Powell (""Julie & Julia"") or MFK Fisher for food humor or Kathryn Harrison for child abuse, but this book is bland enough to be neither. So Mum kept burning the toast...and burning the toast... and burning..."
2,Not what I expected,"I read 60 pages of this book, and felt so depressed and shocked by some of the events the author described (having nothing at all to do with food, believe me) that I decided I didn't want to read any more. A few of the events were downright disturbing, and they were just related and then forgotten about. Next chapter - types of British candy. Wow!Really, this is more of a psychological portrait of a young boy than a book about food. Just be ready for it. Obviously lots of people loved this book- I didn't."
4,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL,Nigel Slater gains admiration for his books dealing with gardening and cooking the produce by telling about a boyhood of neglect and deprivation.
5,Surprisingly funny at times.,"This book was an impulse purchase, so I didn't know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is reflective, sweet, and even absolutely hilarious at times. Even when the author writes about sad subjects, humor comes through. I thought that being a reader from the U.S. added more pleasure to the reading, as there were new and interesting (for me, at least) British food references that I enjoyed reading about."
4,TOAST is sweet.,TOAST is a warm and honest look at a boy's life in England. Nigel Slater even supplies us with a glossary at the end of the book for those of us who don't understand English slang. I read it where ever I was!
1,I would like to read this book,"I would like to read this book and was going to buy it to read on my Kindle today but could not since apparently ""This title is not available for customers from your location in: Asia & Pacific."" I wonder if there might be something wrong with a business model that deprives an author of royalties but oh well- I will just have to wait till I find the book in the library and read it for free."
5,Wonderfully written,"I loved this book. I generally don't read memoirs and was not sure about this when someone recommended it, but as soon as I started reading it, I was hooked. This is the story of a boy coming of age, and his relationship with food, both good experiences and bad. It is intensely funny, a bit sad, and entirely an interesting look into the life of a family. Recommended reading!"
4,Islam,"I thought this book was great for providing information on not only the religion but the culture of Islam. It does not try to prove or defend the religion, just provide information."
3,A good learning tool about Islam,I read this book several years ago as part on a bible study on Islam.I hope you will enjoy and learn as much as I did out of it.
1,Worst in the Series,"I've read and own many of the ""For Dummies"" series, and this one doesn't deserve the title. It's dry, un-entertaining, and the author seems out of touch with his topic, focusing on minority groups and sects, as well as more obscure parts of the religion that don't exactly apply to Muslims as practiced today. I've since gone back and found factual errors or a misleading representation inside it. I wouldn't recommend the book, save your money on someone else.Instead, I got ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam"" by Yahiya Emerick, and found him a much more articulate author, who explained it in plain english; something that this ""For Dummies"" author didn't do so well."
1,You call this a book?,"This is a horrible representation of Islam. This book openly bashes the shia community as well as misrepresents the sufis. Most importantly, this book has many simplistic errors in interpreting islam. This Christian professor of an author is extremely bias in his writings. I personally recommend The complete idiot's guide to understanding islam. Thank you."
3,A Decent Overview of Islam,"Although, as other reviews have mentioned, the books is quite dry and informative, it does provide the reader with and adequate aquaintance to Islam. As far as I can tell, this book (although not written by a Muslim) does not have a pro or anti-Muslim bias. It is meant to inform, not persuade. I feel that this is the reason it is a bit tasteless.Salaam Aliakum,RSM"
1,Buy The Complete Idiot's Guide Instead,"If you want to learn the truth about Islam, you need to read a book written by a Muslim. I bought both this book and The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Islam, which is written by a convert to Islam. Reading this book is like reading about evolution from a creationist's point of view or vice versa. The professor who wrote Islam for Dummies is learned, but his learning doesn't ring true. He takes Christian categories and tries to make Islam fit into them. I decided to shred Islam for Dummies rather than re-sell it and give someone else an opportunity to be misled about Islam. Both this book and The Complete Idiot's Guide are covering the basics--you won't be an expert in Islam after you read them. But at least if you read The Complete Idiot's Guide, what you will know will be true."
2,A Book of Duds,"I always liked Steve Allen, and he can certainly string well-written sentences together, but these stories are all duds. They lack dramatic tension, go nowhere, and end with this befuddled reader asking ""is that all there is?"""
2,you gotta be kidding me!,you can see threw it! wnted something diff for halloween...you need to wear something under it! not happy at all
1,not New King James version,ordered this item which was advertised as 'Franklin BIB-1450 New King James/International Dual Bible' specifically to get the NEW KING JAMES Translation. The unit is advertised incorrectly in Amazon.com. it is not New King James Translation. it is KJV/NIV.
2,"Product is well-made, but...","This tool is compact, lightweight, and easy to use, but... Though it is great that the makers knew to include both translations that are often familiar, what I really want is to be able to search two or more keywords together, to find a passage. Boolean searching of these texts would be wonderful, but I don't think this is now available in any tool. The screen is a bit difficult to read, too."
1,not worth it,"The device only worked about 3 or 4 times for me before crapping out. The charging unit does NOT charge the IPOD though plugged into the lighter socket my 4thGen Ipod announced it was not charging, they have a USB port you can plug a battery backup in to run the ipod. reception was a little staticy when it did work. I would NOT suggest this product at all."
5,HEH,"I made the perfect Ash Ketchum(First Generation) gloves with the Kelly green!! For any of those who have that idea, these are great for it!At first, i was hesitant since costume gloves are really cheap fabric but the quality is amazing and comfortable! i recommend this item."
4,Good gloves,"The gloves were just as expected, they will go great with my costume. my only complaint, is a very small one, but the color is a bit different than the image. In the picture the gloves are a very bright eggplant purple, when in person they are a bit of a dull violet. not a huge issue, just thought I'd mention it."
2,Navy it's not!,"I needed navy colored gloves to match a navy dress hat and shoes. A true navy should be hard to distinquish between black and navy. I tried to order navy dress gloves with 3 different on-line companies. The color swatch on-line appeared to be an actual navy, but when the gloves actually arrived, they were more of a royal blue. That was the case with this purchse as well. Very disappointing that these companies don't seem to be able to distinquish between an actual navy and royal blue. I had to resort to finding a lovely pair of navy gloves in a local vintage shop."
2,Gah!,Well I was looking for winter gloves and didn't know these weren't that such. So i was a little disappointed when my hands had to freeze.
2,Don't waste your money,"There is absolutely nothing in this book that you couldn't find doing a brief search yourself on the Web. I thought there would be some added insights, such as character traits attached to these occupations, etc., but there was nothing like that. And the jobs included are frustratingly basic. I needed to do research on three occupations--librarian; computer scientist, and doctor--and NONE of them was in that book. I was very disappointed."
2,A Good Springboard,"This book is a good starting place if you're considering one or a few careers for your character. If you find that the career is in this book (good chances are it isn't) then this is a good tool for the process of elimination. If you find after reading the entry that you're still interested, then secondary research is definitely needed. Occupational Handbook, The Big Book of Jobs, etc. offers really detailed info for just such a thing.This one's good for a library shelf, but not your home library."
5,The last interesting band?,"A brilliant album by a brilliant band. Jittery guitars, growling bass, clanking percussion, and strange creepy imagery."
3,"Decent, but lacking some of their original bite","The principle gutairist, songwriter, whoever it is, can write a decent song in his sleep, but he is lacking the unique interplay that made this band's sound so special on balloon. Many songs on this album come of as something that Failure could have wrote, not that that is inherently bad, but it just sort of tarnishes the sacredness that made the first album some sort of underground phenom... Alas, welcome to the followups of so many powerhouse albums."
2,"Not bad, but nothing great either.","This CD is refreshingly different. Poppy, rocky, and peppered with background clanks and clicks, OBTAINIUM is a well executed alternative record that doesn't try too hard to be cool, it just is. Several musical influences are put to use as the songscape bounces from guitar driven rock to banjo rockabilly throughout the eleven quick tracks. A fast, punchy album that has the quirkiness of a MIKE PATTON project but without the wierdness. SKELETON KEY creates a unique and original sound heavy with bass and smooth hooky singing with nice guitar work rounding the package off. A nice recording to have in an alternative collection that caters to the truly alternative. After a few listens becomes a tad listless and plain."
3,"More like ""After Skeleton Key""","Warning: The ensemble that plays on this record has only one member in common with the group that produced the underrated 90s classic, ""Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon,"" frontman/bassist Erik Sanko. The shambolic, syncopated skronk has disappeared, to be replaced with something tamer and glossier. Some early mp3s by this lineup infuriated me, because they sounded slick in the worst way. But after hearing the new lineup live, I've been slowly coming to terms with the new sound. I almost liked it when I realized that it sounded like a scrap-metal Spike Jones. If this band had a new name, I'd probably give this album 4 stars. But as long as they call themselves ""Skeleton Key"" I'm going to compare them to the original lineup, and they will suffer by comparison."
3,wish they were still the original band,"If you are considering this album, do yourself a favor and check out their first album from 1997 also: Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon. That earlier band is almost gone now, except the frontman and this album is not quite as noisy and strange as their wonderful first effort. Still, this is pretty good, just more produced and mainstreamish."
5,a dark opus,"Ever since I picked up a copy of the, then as yet to be release Crow movie soundtrack, and then a copy of the graphic novel, I've considered O'Barr's work a modern masterpiece for the ages. Nevermind all the trashy sequels designed to capitolize on the original soulfulness of the original. Fear and Bullets is a dark opus that takes you to another world, while some of it may be a little too metal/industrial sounding for some, it is none the less the perfect accompaniment to the graphic novel."
3,"Good, but could be better",I was expecting this book to have more information on manipulation techniques and pictures to accompany them but that was not the case. The book has been helpful on occasion when learning osteopathic principles and anatomy.
4,"Cute, but very tiny","I should have read the first review before I ordered these. They are very cute and well made, but so small I don't know what I am going to use them for. Any suggestions are welcome."
1,Too simplified to be of any use.,"I really like the Visual Quickstart line but this particular volume is not worth the money unless you have never, ever, used a Macintosh in your life. I was looking for a resource that would take me beyond changing icons, or setting the date and time of OS X. The power of this new operating system goes beyond the GUI and I felt this book should have at least addressed some of the basic features of the Terminal and Apache web server.I will say that Maria Langer has written an excellent introduction to the Macintosh environment but if you have used a Macintosh since verion 7.1 of the operating system then this book is of no use to you."
1,The Worst Visual Quickstart Guide Ever!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Every time a topic you would be interested in are discussed, the answer presented as ""see our next book, Visual Quickpro Guide"". And that is unacceptable. You can't ever learn OS X from this. No way. And I won't buy Quickpro either. Instead, I suggest if you really wanna learn about OS X, check out Mac Os X - The Complete Reference by Jesse Feiler. It contains everything this book SHOULD have had."
3,Dohnanyi: Complete Piano Works Vol. 1,"Generally speaking, a very competent performance of some unjustly neglected compositions for solo piano. Pianist Markus Pawlik has unlimited technique, but his phrasing tends more to the metronomic than to the rhapsodic. That's too bad, because these pieces cry out for an ultra-romantic sensibility. The Naxos recording has a vivid and full presence which sometimes exaggerates the brightness of Pawlik's instrument and possibly contributes to the harsh sound evident in passages where big, fortissimo playing is required. Still, for the budget price, it's a great introduction to some fabulous piano compositions in the great Romantic style."
4,"A great Disney video, begging for DVD release!","These Disney VHS cartoons were released in the 1980s, and I fondly remember renting the series many times from the local video shop. This particular tape is focused on Pluto and his exploits with the Disney gang. An excellent collection, which hopefully Disney will release on DVD along with others in the Cartoon Classics series. Until then, look for used VHS tapes in the Amazon Marketplace and auction sites."
5,Knitting into the Mystery,"As the founder of a Prayer Shawl Ministry in our church, I found this book to be very inspirational. I would recommend it to anyone involved in this ministry."
3,"Big print, lots of prayers......","Depending on your needs, you will either find KNITTING INTO THE MYSTERY an illustrated book of prayers and a woefully inadequate source for knitting instructions, or you will like it.I am relearning to knit after all these years, and while it is true that I may need all the help I can get including prayers, I found this little book practically useless...so I sent it back. The authors have included one Hindu prayer apparently written in ancient Sanskrit(!!?) which I cannot read, so the book isn't completely overtly Christian -- which I am not. Why do some folks assume everyone interested in meditation is Christian? And how can you read prayers while you knit?I ordered and kept KNITTING FOR DUMMIES as it includes what I need --simple instrucions for the beginner with much more text and many photos of knitting needle positions."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I guess I had high expectations for the mechanics of meditation while knitting, which weren't fulfilled.There are some brief references to the ""Divine Feminine"" which could be offensive to some readers.There are some lovely prayers and stories, however.The instructions for knitting the actual shawls seem to assume that everyone would be using the k3p3 modified seed pattern which is fast but not very attractive. I do like the idea of these groups, though, and the idea of prayer while making a garment for the recipient, and it will probably be a reference for the prayers and organizational information."
5,"A peacefully satisfying and inspiring read, a brilliant concept.","A book which will draw you in to the depth of its vision, the reality of the Unseen and the practicality of a simple, delightful, peaceful occupation while thinking of and helping others. First read hurriedly on loan from a friend, I knew it was a book I needed in my collection. One I would return to for its peace and wisdom. Everything you need to be part of this knitting outreach to those who suffer is explained in detail along with how this can be a group endeavor to the benefit of those participating as well as to the receiver of a shawl. A peacefully satisfying and inspiring read, a brilliant concept."
2,"Works well, but UGLY","This thing works well, but stands out like a sore thumb. It's big, bulky, and archaic. They could have made it much more compact and streamlined, like other company's sensors are. This has a separate old style wired magnet sensor, and the wire runs to the transmitter. So you have to mount three pieces, instead of two."
3,Door sensor,This is the only thing that will work with the alarm system I have. But I do not approve of it. There is a wire that goes between the main transmitter and the two smaller pieces next to it. It is not the most attractive when hanging o your door. But it does get the job done.
4,"A Bit Bulky and Unsightly, but works","Bought for my daughter after a break-in. The battery compartments make it bulky, but as a wireless system the installation is unbeatable. Sure brings the kids some extra piece of mind."
2,Works so-so,"I installed a couple of these. They kind of work as when you open the window slowly, they don't always trip the alarm. Close the window and they do trip the alarm. So if any thieves are responsible enough to close the window after leaving with my goods then the system will go off. Better later than never, right?"
5,A new English Invasion,"Damon Brown is a young trumpet player from Bristol/London area of the UK. I first heard him jam in London while on a trip ...and he knocked me out!!Mr. Brown has moments when he remindes me of another Brown- Clifford. But he has evolved into a simply lovely trumpet player.""Rhythm Indicative"" was a first album. His quintet was a hit at the 1999 Red Sea Jazz Festival in Israel. His most recent album, ""Good Cop Bad Cop"" is an excellent example of a jazz musician maturing and mastering his craft.I highly recommend his music to anyone who wants to be on the ""ground floor"" of a blossoming jazz trumpet player."
4,Skewers Noughties Metropolitan Life,"Peep Show, now into its 5th series is perfectly pitched to capture the woes of the 20 something generation currently living in London. Mark (safe, conservative, anxious) lives with Jeremy (lazy, self-obsessed, hopelessly naive) in a grotty flat in Croydon (none of the palpably unrealistic 'Friends' style luxury apartments here). Their lives unfold hitting all the touchstones of modern life - the vanity, the junk nature of food and relationships, the self-obsession, the contractual ethos of sexual relationships.The difference between their lives and yours is that theirs is much more tragic, farcical and funny. They don't get any wiser with time - they just plunge hopelessly from one messy enganglement to another, with hillarious results."
5,excellent show,This show is brilliant. It really picks up in season 2 and with each season it gets better.If buying this dvd be aware that it is region 2 and may not play on standard dvd players in north america. I bought a multi-region player just to watch this show and it was worth it.
5,Bloody Fantastic!,"It is nice to sometimes take off the American blinders and look to see what people are watching abroad. This especially applies to Britain, where cutting edge, intelligent and avant garde comedy is still being made and shown, of all places, on public access networks. Peep Show is one such fine example. With only 6 episodes in a season, this series packs more laughs than several years' worth of most network comedies here in the US. It seems each line in every 1/2-hour episode is a finely crafted piece of writing, well-thought-out, and often subtle. So multiple watchings always bring out something new.Fans of The Office, especially the British version, and Arrested Development will really enjoy this one. And, a pleasant surprise, there are 4 more seasons, with season 6 ready to be shown in summer of 2009."
5,Sweet Series,"This is the funniest British series I have ever seen. It is much more funny than ""The Office"". I am actually wondering if anyone knows when the rest of the seasons will be available on Region 1 dvds. If anyone knows this I would appreciate them letting me know. Thanks."
5,Brilliant!,"An utterly amazing drama... up there with the best that human beings have ever produced. Intelligent and absolutely hilarious... Needless to say, certain segments of the American audience (3 star reviewers for eg.) just won't get it..."
4,Wonderfully dry,"I picked this up after hearing it compared favorably to The Office. I wouldn't go quite that far myself, but it's in that same dry, painfully realistic style. Unlike most buddy-comedies, there's no one-dimensional smart guy/dumb guy dichotomy here. Mark and Jeremy both have their good and bad sides, and it's mostly the latter that we see. Here as usual, it's the mistakes and insecurities that provide for most of the laughs, and as with most British comedies, they're not offset by any sappy feelgood resolutions.My only criticism of Peep Show is that it's hard to understand how Mark and Jeremy could be friends in the first place. They're just too different for their relationship to be at all convincing, even if the show tried to establish that part of the story (which it doesn't). Plausible or not, though, the situations the two loveable losers find themselves in are at least very funny!"
5,Release the rest of the series in Region 1 NOW!,I love this show. I've seen it way to many times online. I deserve to watch it on a bloody DVD player from now on. Let's make it happen! Peep Show seasons 2-7 or one big box set.
3,Funny and Annoying,"Jeremy and Mark are two loser roommates who spend most of their time screwing up their own lives. As they do, we get to hear their innermost thoughts and desires, most of which revolve around sex. There are some really funny scenes, but the characters are such losers that it's easier to grimace rather then laugh at their predicaments. Worth a watch, but rent it, don't buy it."
3,"Good storytelling devices, bad story","Do I like the fact that Peep Show is presented from a 1st person POV with internal voice narration? Absolutely. Do I like the fact that neither character has an interesting story to tell? Absolutely not.Key to Peep Show's success is the hilarious hook and line laugher at each episode's end. Unfortunately, it's not really worth sitting through 23 minutes of plodding drudgery highlighted by 3-4 successfully interspersed situational one liners. If you've seen two episodes of Peep, you've seen them all, but if you like the genre of 'funnified' office-centric comedies such as the Office, you'll enjoy Peep."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"A couple of friends recommended this and so I checked it out and I'll never listen to their recommendations again. Every other word out of the character's mouths (or minds) is a curse word. I don't mind cursing, but when it's used in place of a joke or funny situation, it's worthless and annoying. Jeremy's character is a part-time musician and full-time jerk who spends his time making terrible music and trying to score. The only funny bit in the whole first show was when Mark and his date listened to Jeremy's music and couldn't stop themselves from laughing. Unfortunately, what could have been a great scene mainly became an exchange of curse words in Jeremy and Mark's minds. If this series had gone for laughs instead of cheap trash talk, it really could have been funny."
2,A bit disappointing,"If you have heard lots of traditional Sephardic music performed on traditional Arabic and/or medieval instruments by early music ensembles, and you like the sound of the oud, frame drum, ney flute and rebec, then you will probably not like this album. Cantor Ramon Tasat has used mainly arrangements of Sephardic music by Alberto Hemsi and other early 20th century musicians. Hemsi was naturally influenced by his European classical music training, and the Italian opera and German lieder which was popular among 'educated' European audiences of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Alberto Hemsi rearranged Sephardic music for piano. This may have made the music more popular among European audiences 1900-1950. However, if you like the 'Arabic' sound of traditional Sephardic music this album will be a jolt."

2,Lanzar Street Vision SVDVD!*,"I was very dissapointed to learn that this item was refurbished and did not carry the same warranty as a new one. Your online ad said that it was new in the box, which is not the case. So I would have a hard time buying anything from you again. I guess it is the old bait and switch."
4,good video,This is a VHS tape and is in good condition. I am happy to be able to get VHS tapes since I still have a player.
2,Caballe what happened to that mad scene?,"If you are like me Lucia di Lammermoor is all about the soprano! If there is a weak link in the rest of the cast it can all be overlooked if the Lucia is top notch. There are plenty of Lucia's that ARE top notch... Maria Callas, June Anderson ... BEVERLY SILLS! I mean they are out there. Caballe is just not suited to this role. I love her vioce it just can't hit the notes that Lucia requires. The crowning accomplishment of any Lucia is the mad scene.... I have to ask the question, what happened to it... it is almost have gone, it is cut so she doesn't have to tangle with the difficult and rather high ending. Don't waste your time here move on to Beverly Sills recording with the famous glass harmonica in the mad scene, it will be released by Westminster in March 2002."
3,"sorry, but Lucia belongs to Sutherland and Callas","That's right, Caballe's golden voice is not a true coloratura, and the lack of fioritura for the mad scene is unforgettable. She is far better in Lucrezia Borgia, a much more spinto role with less coloratura and high notes. Both Callas and sutherland is infinitely better as Lucia, with the high E flats and true trills on high notes, especially Sutherland if you prefer magnificent technique. But Callas has something almost as important as Sutherland's killer voice, a heart. Caballe is great too, but I wish she'll go above high C. Donizetti an Bellini requires high E flats at the least. Which is where Joan Sutherland is at her most comfortable."
3,Death by Translation,"To echo the senitments of the only other reviewer, the original versions of Ingeborg Bachmann's poems contain some of the most beautiful phrases I have ever encountered. Also a wonderful window into a modern German culture that continues to bear the impossible weight of destruction, sorrow, and betrayal.The translations, however, are not simply pedantic and lacking in all the subtle, lyric musicality of Bachmann's style, they are often downright inaccurate. I have only been leafing through the book for a few minutes, and have already encountered two type-os. This is irresponsible, and quite astounding considering this work was done by someone who considers himself a poet. A good translation could be a work of art in its own right. What a shame."
5,Bring them back!,"I ordered a pair on clearance to try them out. loved the look.The quality was top notch, and i could tell from the feel that the soles would make you feel like you were walking on air!Unfortunately, i had to send them back, as the size i got was too big... some brands run large, some don't, these do.I really want to have these in the right size, but they haven't been available since"
3,Quirky,"This is a strange set of songs by a quirky songwriter. The numbers are similar in spirit to Leonhart's ""Salamander Pie"". This collection has an added bonus. It was the introduction of Leonhart's beautiful and talented daughter Carolyn, who sings with him on ""Freedom Jazz Dance"". She is a super stylist and has earned her title, ""Princess of Jazz""."
5,Definitive Recording,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the definitive recording of Rachmaninov's third concerto. Forget Horowitz 1951, this is BETTER. And it's hardly ""out of control"", just so fast and furious, it seems that way sometimes. I'd probably use Ashkenazy or Bronfman to ""introduce"" somebody to this work, but when they were ready for the hardcore stuff, I'd give them a taste of Argerich. The third movement in particular is unbelievably well played, with blinding speed and perfect precision. And it's all live. There's simply no better recording out there."
3,An exciting performance but missing a crucial part,"As many reviewers have said, Argerich is quite exciting in this concerto, but I'm amazed that nobody mentions the fact that she plays the short version of the cadenza in the first movement. For me this is a deal-breaker, as the extended cadenza is the highlight of the piece. I wonder why any pianist, especially one given to fireworks like Argerich, would choose the short cadenza. It simply doesn't compare to the long one for drama and virtuosic thrills."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT SPECTACULAR","While Argerich's performance is quite good, I don't think it is the same league as Horowitz's 1978 performance with Ormandy and the New York Philharmonic [RCA Victor 09026-61564-2]. As silly as this may sound, Argerich is not as delicate as Horowitz. She practically pounds out the intermezzo in the Rachmaninov, and a lot of beauty of Rachmaninov's writing is lost in the process.Rachmaninov actually heard Horowitz perform the Concerto Number 3. Rachmaninov was astounded, commenting that ""he swallowed it hole."" I couldn't agree more.Argerich's performance is appropriate for people looking for a second version to add to their collection. If you only have one CD to buy, though, skip the Argerich and buy the Horowitz instead."
1,immature interpretation,"These are two of my favorite concertos but all I hear on these recordings is a pianist playing too fast and sloppy with no regard to the ""meaning"" of the music. For a great Rach 3 I recommend either Byron Janis or Van Cliburn."
5,Lightness and incredible speed,"This performance of the Rach 3 may be my favorite. Argerich plays with incredible speed but a lightness and sprightliness of touch that is astonishing. Compared to her performance, Horowitz (whose performances of the Rach 3 I love) appears overbearing and plodding at times, with uneven technique. Argerich on the other hand displays remarkable evenness in her playing.In terms of her performance, the Rach 3 is stronger than the Tschaikovsky No 1 on this disc; in terms of the orchestra, I find it the opposite. I'm not 100% thrilled with her performance of the Tschaikovsky, except for the final movement, which she begins with intensity that literally stunned me, and which she carries through to the end. I would get this disc first and foremost for the Rachmaninov -- many consider this the best recording of that piano concerto available. It is a remarkable performance."
1,what a bunch of horse dung!,"and this musical waste material does NOT cease to stink after 3 days, or 3 years, or 300 years!"
1,This item is badly advertised!,"I was told this item worked with mmc/sd cards. When I got the item, plainly on the box it says for use with Handspring Visor only, which is pretty much an obsolete PDA. It does not work with any of the new PDAs that house the SD cards. I have a PalmOne LifeDrive and it's way too big for it. Don't buy this item unless you have a Handspring Visor!!"
4,Good times rock & roll,"Do you remember when rock & roll was fun? Remember the days before rock lyrics became saturated with angst, anger, and political BS? ""Outlaws, Fools and Thieves"" by NYC legends Roxx recaptures the fun of the glam rock era. But, don't be fooled, this is no mediocre wanna-be band. Roxx has a tight sound, with excellent vocals, good guitar work and loud drums. It's unbelievable that these guys never received a recording contract with a major label, which they seriously deserved. Without naming names, Roxx is better than a number of bands of the glam era that actually did get a contract. Highlights on this CD (in my opinion) include ""What's a Boy to Do?"", ""Tell Me"", ""Rocking Horse"", ""In the Groove"", and ""Turns to Gold."" However, there is really not a weak song on the CD, and we can only hope that there is more where this came from. So, sit back, crank up the volume, and enjoy the sounds of Roxx as they bring glam rock into the 21st century."
3,At the very least they should have been signed.,"I have been buying alot of these cd's recently, bands who had talent, but never etched a record deal for one reason or another. Sometimes you scratch your head and say, huh, how did these guys slip through the cracks, and then others you say they really did'nt deserve to be signed.Roxx was a band that seemed to have the party-metal formula down pat, but after several listens, you can't help but start to lose interest. With that being said; there are some decent tracks on here, Rocking Horse, takes the lead (pardon the pun) and What's A Boy To Do is pretty strong as well. The major problem with the album is production, and I know they were'nt signed, but it hurts the overall sound of the album. I guess I never realized how much producers bring to the music biz.Overall, I am not mad about buying this album. There are some good songs on here, and with a solid production these guys might have been good."
3,Good movie,"""Lena"" is a riveting tale of a young woman's struggle to find herself as she is thrown into a diverse world of organized crime; propelled by the actions of her father, Lena must cope with her life moving at a million miles per hour.The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the direction. The movie quality is wonderful and the scenes are staged great. I'm not a huge plot of the storyline, though, as it could have been more developed. Also, I'm very disappointed with the dialog of the characters; I felt like the writers could have used more vibrant language instead of using regular, plain-old language (for those who do not speak Spanish and used the subtitles, think of the difference in language between, ""Fantastic Four"" and ""The Queen."") I feel like a lot of the dialog was just fluff, but that's my opinion.Overall a good movie, not my favorite, though."
1,disappointed,This CD had better instrumental quality than vocal. Some of the vocal songs were like fingernails on the blackboard--off key. The instrumental songs seemed to have more electric guitars than steel drum sounds. I was very disappointed.
3,"If you're into trance, you'll enjoy","Don't let the 3 stars mislead you, this is a pretty decent album probably more along the lines of 3.5 stars. It's ultimately hurt by the inclusion of vocals. If you want to call them vocals, some of the tracks are just a guy talking (Tracid Theme, Too Many Times, etc.), the ones with the female hold up a little better. Though I would have appreciated this more if it would have been all instrumental, but perhaps it breaks up the monotony a bit. This is much better then the majority of trance out there has some nice buildups and isn't quite as cheesy as some. Soo if you are still a fan of trance, I recommend this if you can afford the import price. But if you get bored of this type of music, this cd probably won't change your mind. Peace, love and unity :)"
5,For every body that is an American,Need to read this book and see how the real world works behind the cameras. You can see what a great man President Reagan really was and how bad some of the people around him were.
2,"Some insights, too much conservative bias","This little book is a disappointing analysis of the presidential election of 1980 by a conservative scholar of American politics. Even though it contains somme interesting insights about the political dynamics of the late seventies and about presidential campaigning at the end of the party era in presidential politics, the book does not add much to the existing litterature on these topics and suffers from its unmistakable -however hypocritical-conservative bias."
3,Nice story but ends abruptly,"Although the core of this story is about finding a suitable groom for Lata, the book traverses different story lines at snails pace and suddenly in the last 100 or 150 pages, things come to a sudden end. Seems like the author suddenly lost interest and wants to finish a tome. Otherwise good."
5,Sumitra,"A 1500 page book. What a read! Only third of the way through it so far, but a diverse mixture of family life, Indian politics, spirituality, drama. Truely something for everyone who enjoys a good long read. Extremely well written."
2,Abandoned it!,"After getting about 300 pages into the 1350-page hardcover edition, I decided to abandon it. I found that I kept stalling on the various Indian names, places and vocabulary (which was not very clearly explained when used -- I had to figure out what an item/term meant by how the word was used). It was aggravating after a while. I'm sure I barely scratched the tip of the iceberg in appreciating this novel, but with so many other books out there and so little time to read, I had to move on, since it was laborious to get through even one chapter, let alone all 19 of them."
2,"Ultimately, not worth the effort","This book was a real roller coaster for me. I did become totally engrossed in it about mid way, but I'm afraid my overall impression was that the book needed a serious editing. I felt many of the female characters were very one-dimensional. In particular, I was disappointed with the last few chapters and came away from the suitable boy with a feeling of blandness."
4,Worth the time,This very large book is well worth the time it took me to read it ( almost two weeks). I enjoyed the characters relationships with each other and the descriptive settings of the novel very much. Ido think that the politics could have been shortened by at least 20 pages as much of it was redundant.
5,one of the best audio / dramatized books !!!,one of the best audio / dramatized books !!!one of the best audio / dramatized books !!!very well done !
3,"worth reading once, but won't read it again","Seth's characters are realistic, though somehow shallowly portrayed. Many scenes show great wit and perception. I felt it was almost worth wading through the religious and political tedium (which did, actually, teach me something about India's history) in order to find out what happened to the characters. However, I felt somehow ripped off at the end. In all, a book that's worth reading once quickly, but one I won't read a second time."
5,An Unparalleled Guide to India (History and Culture),"This book so engrossed me (after getting past the first 100 pages ... yes it is slightly long) that I was obsessed with India thereafter. Seth is able to put characters to life like few others and gives a truly realistic impression of what this vast, diverse and magical country is about. I would not hesitate to read anything put out by Seth (and am currently reading An Equal Music)."
5,Surley comparable to Austen,"I have just copleted writing a 4,000 word essay comparins the book to pride and prejudice. Seths completely immerses you in to The society and just as austen feed of his characters who show you what life was really like. His prose if not his dramatic irony are surley comparable to Austen.Read this book and you will have the characters and the setting with you for life."
3,Can be Shrunk to 7 pages!!!!,"Yes... that is what VS. Naipaul said about -- A Suitable Boy....a good plot.. but it seems to go on and on .....and the end is so useless.. althought it gives us a claer idea of newly independant india .. hindu - muslim realtions... it tells us the pluck of that generation.....i'm an indian and yes, some of the instances are very true to even this day.. the marriges , the orthodox thinking .. etc etc.it's a long read with no postitive outcome. read it for the sake of apt words and litrature.. all in all.. it's ok... don't expect too much and u just might like it."
2,dickens all over again,"This book is for people who like Dickens. I'm a big fan of Seth, and have read and enjoyed most of his other books, but I just didn't have the stomach to get more than 100 pages into this. The array of characters is stunning, and I just couldn't remember each one, or get attached to any of them. I'll probably go back and read this book when I'm 70 and have the time to pour over this tome. His tone has a laughing clarity to it that's wonderful.But for now, I have to give it a miss."
2,Novel as Gimmick,"This book just cries out for an editor to cut the oodles of extraneous stuff in it. The story's OK and would deserve more stars if it were told in a leaner manner. In its present form, it seems nothing more than a gimmick to get press and promote sales."
4,Its in the characters not the country,While its' enjoyable to understand India through this book the real beauty of the book lies in Seth's development of the characters and how by the end of the book you think you feel like you just want to know more and more about them. Its similar in that way to Arundati Roy. Its' the characters rather than the Indian background that make both books excellent reading.
5,A more than excellent read!,"I am so glad I found this book. Mr. Seth shows an amazing perception of the feminine heart. The political scenes, I must admit, I skipped. It is an enlightening tale of human nature and paints a vivid picture of everyday human existance in a very colorful India. Highly recommended!"
4,Needs cutting,"I loved this book, but I do feel it would have found a wider audience if it had been cut by its editor. The book gives a wonderful survey of the first years after Independence. It follows several families from different communities. I often had to look back to see who belonged to which family. The author describes India's growing pains with intelligence and stays unbiased, something unusual in this large, multi-religous country. I do think it would have benefited by cutting some of the Parliamentary debates and the long explanations on manufacturing shoes. I also think a glossary would have helped. I lived in India for a few years and there were words I was not familar with. An explanation of what some of the holidays are would also be helpful. I was not familar with all of them. It is very welll written and I am glad I perservered."
1,WASTE OF TIME,"I am sorry but after reading all those praises about this book i could not resist. I think that this book is totally crap and if u read it u might think in the end..""What the hell?"" The book is long..and when i say that i mean it. It portrays 30 characters and they are all one worser than the previous one. DO NOT READ IT. I WASTED 2 and a half weeks on it and i could have read something more decent in that time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! MAKE BETTER USE OF IT!!"
5,Its like walking through a dream,"Although this book is so thick, its so gripping that I could hardly stop reading it once I started. There are so many interesting characters that at the end of the book you would wish you knew more about many of them. Any reader will fall in love with the characters of this book. The book also presents a good and authentic picture of India and its culture. But I still do not agree with Seth's philosophy that any passionate relationship ends up nowhere."
3,"A book that moved me, but finished on a hollow note","Beautiful lush scenes and characters evolve from the first page of this big (huge) novel. I read it religiously following the plots of the many characters. Beautifully written prose drives you to the finish that is unfortunately lame. With so many characters, and such a promising begining and middle, the ending is anticlimatic."
4,Terrific!,"I read this book about half a year ago and thought it was absolutely wonderful. The size of the book was daunting, but all in all it was a terrific experience. I read it soon after going to India on vacation and the small bit of knowledge I had really helped. I urge you, if you put this book aside or didn't like it, learn some history and read it again. It's awesome!"
4,"Wonderful book, but readers should get help with some terms","This novel is absolutely enthralling, the ""main"" plot alternates with subplots that are just as interesting and captivating. Not having a prior knowledge of Indian Culture, I did feel bad about not really grasping some of the events (like the subtleties of Saeeda Bai's choice of songs or the sequence of religious festivals). Maybe a glossary of some sort could be included in a future edition. The book sure made me want to know more! The characters themselves are universally appealing and linger on one's mind for a long time. I read it just after Arundhati Roy's ""God of Small Things"", a very different book in style, and the combination made me like each one of them better."
5,There's a place for excerpts,"This is a fine sampling of Rachmaninoff. I have purchased a number of discs from this series and find them to be very useful as an introductory tool, a learning tool and for pure entertainment of a worthwhile level.By all means use this sampler as a primer and follow by acquiring great performances of the whole second symphony and piano concerto, the complete preludes. There is so much great music to learn and love. Phillips has done a service by making available and accessible this venue for great music. (Brahms at Bedtime is a ravishing sampling of a complex composer).Enjoy!"
2,"Sing out, Sylvia!","Having enjoyed McNair's light soprano in performance of classical material and being an Arlen fan, I thought this album would be ideal listening. I was sorely dissapointed. McNair sounds exhausted. Not ragged or raw, but tired, completely lacking in energy. On many of the tracks she is barely audible. And if there's any acting going on here, it's not readily apparent. For true cross-over heaven, check out Kiri TeKanawa's Gershwin and Irving Berlin albums, and Dawn Upshaw's Rodgers and Hart tribute and her album entitled ""I Wish it So."""
2,iPAQ Overheats,"iPAQ overheats at random times, automatically discharging the battery. I've exchanged this three times. Same thing happens, even without installing programs not already included on the device. HP says this issue was resolved in previous versions. It wasn't."
5,SO EASY!,"I just purchased this book a few weeks ago, and I cannot believe how easy the recipes are. Simple ingredients... awesome results. I first tried the seven-layer dip - SUCCESS! Everybody loved it... and wanted the recipe. With recipes like these, I am definitely looking forward to hosting many more parties!"
5,FunTime Family Night--Dip It and a Movie!,"After searching EVERYWHERE for a recipe for ratatouille that children could at least TOLERATE to go along with a fun home movie night--I found this gem of a book. There are several excellent dips using common ingredients like lime and cilantro, one ""home made"" onion dip that--frankly--we liked the soup mix kind better AND the ratatouille receipe! His good suggestions included cutting up the veggies into good size pieces (about 1/2 "") and roasting them first. That keeps their color and it doesn't turn into a grey mush. Additionally, because this is FUN, the kids can actually pick out ""suspect"" veggies because they can see them. Typically they get so engrossed in the movie and it's love of fine food they can be persuaded to at least try a new veggie. Best of all the sidebars offer many good suggestions for non-traditional dippers--like toasted whole grain pita triangles to make a meal out of a fun time."
5,Put it on DVD please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I remember watching this movie when I was little. I beg of you to put it on dvd because it was such a good little musical. It's probably been 15 years since I last saw it, but I remember absolutely adoring the staging of this story."
4,A great way to learn about the Grimm Brother's fairy tales,"I saw this film a while ago, and it still holds strong in my memory as a very good movie. While it is obvious that this film is meant for children, there is no reason that adults (children of all ages) cannot enjoy this film. There are several silly and cheesy moments, from the costumes to the dialogue (i.e. really really bad jokes), even to the acting. However, in this case the good outweighs the bad. One of the most remarkable thing about this film is that most, if not all, of the fairy tales mentioned are set in some way to music and/or dance. To see these fairy tales come to life in this way is remarkable. I would definitely recommend this film to every child I know...and even to a few adults."
5,A Comprehensive Book on W3C XML Specifications,"This book is an excellent guide to the various W3C XML specifications. This book is well-organized and well-written. It provides an easy-to-understand overview of the various W3C XML specifications. This books provides a clear roadmap of W3C XML specifications and how they relate to core XML.It also touches on a few non-W3C XML specifications (SAX, RELAX NG, JDOM) which are important to the overall understanding of XML technologies. This book provides an informed overview of the use of these technologies.I recommend this book as a must for any XML library."
5,What a interesting read..,"This book was very interesting. It was a very fast read for me, I think that was because I was following the authors life through her experiences right along with her. I wish there was a follow up to this memoir--but I know I am going to google it and find out more about Tina and the people in her life from a 48 hours program that profiled her and the people that she came into contact with. I also will try to find more memoirs about society and how we treat our young and old that live on the fringes."
1,This was not at all what I expected.,"My husband purchased this for me for christmas. I thought it would be great to have everything in one place, best of all you can synchronize it to MS Outlook. Unfornuately, it was almost impossible to see the screen, the layout was horrible. It did synchronize with Outlook, but to see your schedule for the day, you have to click into each date and scroll down and it tells you to wait for 5 to 10 minutes. You cannot shut it off while it is waiting so you waste your batteries, and end up having to write down whatever it is on paper so you do not forget. I was soooooo disappointed. Also, it took me four days to figure everything out because the instructions were sorely lacking vital information. I know computers I couldn't imagine someone who didn't using this product at all. basically it is an expensive calculator that is difficult to see. I really expected alittle more."
2,Very macho.,"The plot was suspenseful-man against man, man against nature--had excellent dialogue and lots of disreputable characters. The only likable character was the protagonist, and it just seemed off balance to me. The problem was the only part of the story in which I really became engrossed was the ship in the hurricane. The rest I found myself skimming through. Those who like macho good guy stories, although without any likable or interesting side kicks, might enjoy this, but for me, it was strictly an okay read."
3,every one has a weakness,Plenty of character imperfections here. The author testing his sea legs. Some logic holes but he will get there
2,"Poor book, don't waste your money buying it!",Too mathematical in content... The author floods the book with useless math that you can easily derive from classic textbooks. Only the first 3 chapters are more or less ok but the references to websites and bibliography that he makes are much better than his own textbook... This book is useless to experimentalists and to people who want to delve into NEMS. Buy his earlier textbook instead which is much more detailed and which contains a lot of useful information!
1,Incoherent,"Some of the latter chapters do a detailed mathematical treatment of MEMS and NEMS devices, its good if that is what you are looking for, but it was hard to believe the text is written in english at times it is so incoherent. It was so bad I wouldn't finish reading it, thankfully I was able to find it in the library so I didn't waste any money on it."
3,Easy and cute but dim,"The firefly tracklight system was super easy to install, just peel and stick, but it is really an accent light--not enough to read by, for instance, even sitting right below all five lights. I also found that the bulbs have burned out quite quickly when the lights were left on for days but so dim we couldn't tell they were on, and came across this merchant's listing for them as I searched for replacement bulbs.I'm kind of undecided about whether it was worth putting them up at all, and am considering taking them down rather than replacing bulbs."
4,Interesting,"I saw this book in a ""1001 comics you must read..."" Old and damaged but very interesting.With pictures by Harold Foster.I'm very proud of have it."
1,Free Form Noise,"Gato Barbieri has released many great albums over the years, yet he has also released a few stinkers. In Search of the Mystery is one of those last. Yes, he can get lost in extended solos and improvisations and I like that. But this reissue is nothing but nearly 40 minutes of simply awful free form noise. I listened through twice and found nothing to like, so it is destined to collect dust until I get around to selling it. If there was a category for ""no stars"" this would be there. Forewarned is forearmed!"
4,Easy listening for first timers,"If you want to get initiated to the classics, this CD has an excellent selection of radio friendly pieces from Bach. The recording is good and comes off well off most systems, and there are excellent references to great conductors and orchestras, like sir Neville Marriner and St. Martin in the Fields. The selection includes the ""common"" pieces like Air on the G string and Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring as well as invigorating pieces like Heinz Hollinger's Oboe Concerto in A, which to date is still the best performance of that piece I have heard to date."
5,Great improvement over mountain tires,"I bought a pair of these for my wife's mountain bike that is only used on pavement. Much quicker, quieter and comfortable than the stock tires. Great value!"
4,She is great!,I havent heard the track on the radio yet but I saw her open for Macy Gray in Boston the other day and she was fabulous. Gladly was marvelous and she and her band absolutely rocked. Definetely worth listening to.
4,"""Gladly"" buy the album","I saw Sy Smith when she opened for Macy Gray in San Diego and was not only impressed by her voice, but her playful presence on stage. Her cover of Prince's ""Kiss"" was enough to make me look out for her upcoming album release. Her music is fun to listen to and the ""don't take anything too seriously"" attitude is infectious. Definitely one of the more refreshing opening acts I've seen in a long time."
4,Martika: A Flash Back,Depending on whether you were a fan in the nineties.. For myself Revisiting some of her hits was excellent. Holding onto this album for the times is a must.
2,a review,if you want to hear the famous toy soilders then you'd be better off buying her single! They cut her voice down right at the end!!!!! :-(
3,Flashback..,"To me, this cd is good for the 3 songs that were on the radio at the time... I don't like the rest of it."
1,What a disappointment!,"We had such high expectations for this stroller for our two girls - we were quickly disappointed. Purchased at a boutique baby store in Dallas - at a premium price. All was fine until we started using it. The cup holder fell off immediately - and could not be reattached. The name plates peeled off the front - within reach of our 11 month old (she immediately peeled it off to try to eat). The straps will not stay attached to the seat. Each time we use, we must re-loop them in to the seat back. Moreover, it is hit or miss as to whether it will easily close or open. There are times when it will not close and we have to stow it half closed. Other times we cannot get it opened - usually when we are in a hurry. When it does open - it opens easily; however it is most often a struggle. Our $20 (single) stroller from Babies 'R Us is much more reliable. Steer clear of this stroller!!"
1,WORST STROLLER,"This has to be one of the worst strollers that i have ever bought. it is horriable on bumps, my kids almost flew out. also, the cup holder fell off. steering is so bad... i actually dont like go to out because of how bad this stroller is. i rather stay home. i am looking into something different. oh, also when you call customer service they wont replace the stoller, big no no! just send you the same torturing wheels."
3,M82,This fine warm up to what would become the full-bodied embrace of their synthesized sound cannot quite capture the production depth of future releases but still comes across as a very competent amateur release.
3,New or Old?,"I was a little disappointed in this album, because it seemed like a step back from their previous. ""Before the Dawn Heals Us"" is an incredible album, and the one to buy if you're new to M83. This album is much less focused, and loses the intensity they established in ""Before the Dawn..."" It would make sense, however, if this is an earlier album newly released in the states."
3,Doesn't have the questions like the adult version has,I bought this to use for a teen small group. I LOVE the Adult version of this as it has small group questions for each piece of scripture. But to my surprise this Bible had no questions in it. It's meant more for individual reading and not foe teen small groups.
5,Cartoons on Silly Symphonies Disney Limited Gold Edition,"Silly Symphonies Disney Limited Gold Edition includes seven cartoons that are Silly Symphonies. All of the seven cartoons are in color. The cartoons are Birds in the Spring (1933), The China Shop (1934), The Flying Mouse (1934), The Cookie Carnival (1935), Woodland Cafe (1937), The Moth and the Flame (1938) and Farmyard Symphony (1938). This video runs 54 minutes and dosen""t have any bonus features."
5,Very impressed,This product was in excellent condition when I received it. It's an old tape so I didn't expect the quality to be perfect and was pleased at its overall appearance on arrival. It played well with the few minor glitches inherent to old VHS cassettes but overall it worked great. I would purchase from this seller again.
1,where's the D width ?,I would buy these except for the fact they don't come in a D width. These kinds of shoes need to come in wide sizes because not all of us were blessed with narrow feet.They do however look very styleish.
2,Does not work with Blu-ray,I bought this camera because I thought it would be easy to record great HD images and play them back on my Blu-ray player quickly. Problem is this camera will not record on the new 8cm blu ray media. This means it will only record for 23 mins with the largest disc available in HD mode. I would suggest the hard drive format until they get this availability. Better yet I would go with the Sony if you want to use the new Blu-ray 7.5 8cm discs which will record for up to 2 hours.
1,All form and no function.,"I bought this shaver before it was discounted. Too bad for me.On the plus side, it looks really nice, it has good controls and features, and the battery life is good.On the minus side, it doesn't shave worth a darn. I've had many shavers during my many years, and the Axis is by far the worst at getting the beard off my face.Definitely not recommended."
1,Sleek Design but zero execution of a shave,Purchased this razor awhile ago with the hopes of achieving a quality shave but I was poorly mistaken. The design is sleek but the actual execution is horrible I wouldn't recommend this for any man looking for a good outcome. I'm aware it takes several weeks for your face to get used to a new razor but this product isn't worth the wait. Do not waiste time or money on this razor keep searching for the right one. Buyer beware stay away from Axis AX5330.
1,Multiply your shaving time by 3 times,"I've used several electric shavers, and this is, without question, the worst. It's too bad that they don't allow you to give zero stars, because this item qualifies. Every time you touch the shaver to your face, expect it to buzz and slow down because it doesn't have the power to cut through the most basic and simple stubble. One good thing is that the buzzing acts as a warning signal that the shaver is about to start tugging hairs out of your face, rather than cutting them. To quote my favorite product review of all time, ""to call this a flaming pile of crap would be an insult to fire and crap."" By the way, I paid about a third of the price on this site, and the item was brand new in its packaging, so clearly there is an issue with selling the product in the first place. Oh, it's the nicest looking shaver I've ever seen, if only the looks matched the performance..."
1,Better to upgrade to something of better quality.,"I bought one of these, then when the price went down, ordered another before opening the first. It was awful. Uneven stand, cheaply made lid. The ""fuel holders"" are for tealight candles, not sterno. There is no way to adjust the heat, and the instructions tell you not to let the heat source touch the glass. The price is higher now. Add a bit more money and get one that you will get good use out of for years."
1,What a squeal!,"These pads were quiet for the first two weeks. I have taken them apart three times and cleaned, with no change to the squeal! There are no shims and the paint peels off quickly. I would not recommend these pads and hopefully, these are still under warranty......"
3,Not for you over 30 crowd,"Oh well. Reading this I felt really old (I'm over 30!!). The heroes and heroines meet at ""raves"" (translation: techno-parties) and every other sentence starts with ""Dude.... This is a book for the really young and hip crowd I guess. It just gets old after a while with all the ""hip"" talk...."
4,TRACKS,1. J'ai Donné2. Comme Ces Pianos3. Les Clés De Ma Nouvelle Vie4. L'après Bonheur5. Apprivoise Moi6. Je Ne Suis Qu'une Femme7. Ne Lui Reparlez Plus D'amour8. Tu Veux Chanter9. Emmène La10. S'en Aller11. Toutes Les Chansons Ont Une Histoire12. Je N'ai Pas Fini De T'aimer
2,"Beware, not the cult film from 1999 that you may be looking for","I was quite excited to rent this and did not pay attention to the cover photo's thinking I was renting a film by the same name that was so popular in the late 90's. Was very, very disappointing that it was not, as were my family. Feel it is false advertising and at least some clear, easy to see, disclaimer should be presented.With that said, later I did sit down and watch the film and it is ""OK"" and can be interesting, just dont be fooled that you're getting the real thing."
1,Not the movie I thought it was,I didn't even watch it. I was disappointed that it was not the movie by the same name with Kristen Dunst. :(
2,Wrong movie/same title,This was not the movie I thought is was and if I could send it back I would. There is another movie with the same name and that's the one I thought I was ordering.
2,Save your cash!,This is the UK championships. The b boy are tight but the camra angles change too fast to see whats gonig on. I recomened that you save your money and buy a better video.
1,They ruined a good thing.,"This video has some great moves in it, but there are so many camera angle changes that you can barely tell what's going on. Sometimes there are several changes per second. It's extremely annoying. I would say don't bother with this video and instead get something else."
2,Great game but a little deceiving,"i've played battle realms before and it's an awsome game, but when i got this pack i thought that it included the original and the expansion. with this you only get the expansion so you wont be able to play it without the original game, which is a little difficult to find. i can only find 6 games and that on amazon and they are all used. but overall this is a great game but make sure you have the original battle realms before you get this one."
2,Single Use Tubes,On receiving the product I was surprised to learn that each tube is for a single use only and is not resealable. Which makes the 4.99 I paid an outrageous price! I would recommend Dritz Iron-Off instead.
2,Disappointed.,Followed the directions to the tee. This cleaner removed a lot of the teflon coating on the actual iron but didn't remove all of he burnt on crap. The coating is important. It keeps the hot metal from sticking to your clothes and damaging the material. Now I have to buy a new iron.
3,You will not start your business after reading this.,"The book is entertaining but you might not know what business to start at the end of the book any better. It is certainly not a ""how to"" book, rather a collection of often interesting stories of big (Borders books) and small companies with prior existence going into the Internet market. I enjoyed reading it and at least it is not yet dated (give it a few more weeks though)."
2,Too shallow,"I bought this book cos I am planing to start up an internet business. The author should take out the remark at the back cover of the book that says "".....Learn from the pros how to start your own profitable Net venture, ......"" This book doesn't mentioned a single word about the technology, tools or setup used by those successful site."
4,Great Sound - Good Price,This is a great product especially for the price. I recommend this to you if you are looking for a good sound and only have small space on your desk for the speakers. The sub-woofer can go on the ground or wherever.
3,"Not for people who love non-base ( Blue, Pop, acoustic ... )","This Speaker looks great, works great. If you are a fan of Rock, Rap music, this one is definitely the best for you for the price.If you are a fan of non-base music ( Blue, Pop, acoustic etc ... ), be aware that the base cannot be turn off. It is really annoying.That's my best advice."
2,Buzzing & clicking -- poor QA,"The spkrs are nice looking and seem well built, adequate for a PC system. Then after a couple of months, I get the buzz and clicks thru the volume control. A nice system becomes un-usable. Have seen same complaints about same problem w/ other Logitech spkrs, would not recommend these."
4,Can't beat em!,I have now bought two pairs of these speakers. I really feel like they are a great buy and sound great.
3,Okay system for the money,"A pretty nice product for the money, clarity is okay. I have three different speaker systems like this, all of different brands, and out of the three I own this one comes in last. For the money try Creatives 2.1 system. It has the same wattage, is noticeably louder, and sharper sounding. If not that one go with the Cyber Acoustics system at the same wattage, the sub woofer hits better and the overall system is louder without as much distortion."
1,Wasn't what I bought and didn't work-don't buy from GearXS,"I very much looked forward to receiving my Logitech x230 2.1 speaker system for my TV, but when I hooked it up, it did not work. There was something rattling in the woofer box. To top that, my son noticed that the Logitech brand which I ordered appeared to be a cheap knock off called LogiCool. What a bait and switch from the Amazon reseller GearXS. I tried to correspond with them to get them to take it back and pay for the shipping to me, but they never responded. I felt that the substitution of the brand that I bought with a cheap piece of plastic that didn't work was poor business. I will NEVER buy from them and would recommend that they be avoided due to their terrible service and desire to swindle customers."
5,excellent!,"After reading reviews, I decided to buy the Logitech x-230 speakers for my computer. First off the speakers are simple to connect. You simply plug a cable into the subwoofer, one plugs into the computer, and of course it needs to be plugged into a power outlet. The power button, volume knob, and headphone jack are on the front of the right speaker and are easy to access. The knob for the bass is on the back of the subwoofer, which can be annoying if you need to adjust the bass. The sound quality is excellent for the price. The bass from the subwoofer sounds great and packs quite a punch! I had the bass settings on my computer turned way up from my last speakers, but had to turn it down because of the strong bass of the x-230. Overall, these are great speakers for the money. I never thought of Logitech as being a company for audio equipment, but that was money well spent on a great set of speakers!"
5,"Good speakers, fair shipping","Great speakers, I've owned my own for a few years now. However, it took two days longer than the latest ship date for it to arrive at my house. Other than that, I'm pleased with my purchase."
3,Better for older kids,"Purchased this for my 6-yr old who learned to knit recently, thinking it would be an easy, fun craft toy based on previous reviews. The instructions were for the most part easy to follow, but it did take me a good while to figure out how to ""spool"" knit properly. They also have a section about ""tubing"", but I need more time to figure out how to do that. Those instructions were confusing IMO. Overall, would recommend for children ages 8 and older since it does require some dexterity and adult help for younger kids. My daughter is 6, and I had to hold on to the spool while she used the plastic needle to pull the stitch off the spokes. Not what I expected for a toy marketed for ages 6+ but still a good craft toy IMO for the older ones."
3,cool spool knitting kit purchased from Amazon,The idea seemed good but instructions were not clear enough.I bought this for an eight year old very capable with craft products & she was frustrated trying to use it.
5,Love the voice,Show him in concert one time. Loved his verison of You can Leave your Hat on. Miss seeing him in videos on CMT.
2,Used CD with major scratch!,I bought this CD used and it has a scratch on it that basically runs through the two songs I bought it for!DAMN.
3,Not as good as Yorkshire Gold,"I love Yorkshire Gold tea. When I found out that one of the main differences between Yorkshire and Yorkshire Gold was the addition of Ntingwe Kwazulu to the Gold, I thought I would be getting 100% of that special ""note"" I find so enjoyable in YG. Not so, unfortunately. There is a flatness to this tea which is disappointing. For me, it works best as an addition to other loose teas where it seems to round out the flavor. Guess I just like blends. My daughter brought back some grocery store teas from South Africa which were really great and I was hoping this tea would be as good but it's not . Maybe the years have jaded my taste buds and my palate is not as sensitive to the nuances of this tea, but I would never buy it again."
3,A Thousand and One Nights,The story is really corny--it's an old recording and is in great shape. It's just not very well done by today's standards. I wish I had realized just what I was buying; I'd not have purchased it.
3,"Not the best, but still fun to watch.","In the first episode, we meet an interstellar war criminal, which just happens to have a drug formula that can reshape the galaxy and the creatures that use it. As the various races try to get hold of her and her formula, it all comes to an end through an unexpected intervention. A good episode that shows how easily cruelty can prevail.The next episode deals with Dr. Franklin and his attempts to save an alien kid's life, although the cure he offers goes against everything this race believes. Interesting, but somewhat boring."
4,Decent Babylon 5 Season 1 Episodes,"Although neither episode is part of series creator J. Michael Straczynski's 5 year long epic chronicling the Shadow War and its aftermath, they are fine introductions to the Babylon 5 universe, and especially, in the second episode, an excellent look at Dr. Franklin's compassion and love for other sentient beings. Indeed, the second episode, ""Believers"", was one of the finest during Babylon 5's first season. It is a sobering examination of religious zealotry and an insightful look as to how religion can conflict with science. Science fiction writer David Gerrold, best known for his classic Star Trek episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles"", wrote this episode. I believe that it is one of his finest tales ever shown on film; if the video was released without ""Deathwalker"", I'd give it 5 stars, otherwise I have to rate it 4 stars."
5,from foreword,"from forewordDuring many rewarding and otherwise happy years of matrimony, I have found it impossible and unproductive to explain to the wife of my bosom exactly why I like to hunt ducks. Quayle, she understands; but ducks, no! This may be partly because an intimate friend of mine on the board of a local county mental institution was forcibly restrained from leaving the premises after a directors meeting just because he stopped his car near the guardhouse one October evening to honk at a flight of Canadian geese circling an adjacent pond to rest for the night! Since I could not understand this either as he Is one of the finest scholars of my acquaintance, I no longer apologize for duck hunting nor attempt to justify it; I just do it."
5,awesome footage,"We borrowed this video from our library, and were so pleased we are considering buying it. We have a budding storm chaser in the family and, while this video may not contain detailed scientific data, it contains tons of great footage for the eager viewer. Many Tornado movies, documentaries, etc contain more diagrams, interviews, and story build-up than tornado footage. They are often disappointing for those who want to see the awesome spectacle of a tornado. Not this video! Footage abounds!If you want scientific explanations, go read a book.If you want tornado footage, watch this video!"
2,Not that great...,"This 6 disc set (10 episodes) starts out well -- the first two hours are good, with a narrator, footage, and interviews. You know, the stuff you expect to see in a documentary. After that, the producers apparently ran out of money and/or effort, because the rest of the discs are lame. Most of them are just old news reels slapped together. Not that the newsreels themselves aren't interesting or appropriate, but there is nothing else there. No commentary, no narration, no interviews. By the time google puts the national archives footage on-line you can see the same thing for free."
3,Driving music,I listen to this while commuting to and from work. I would have preferred the more romantic works of Chopin on the entire disk.
4,eye candy (almost),"Breathtaking scenery (thanks to Mother Nature) and breathtaking shots (thanks to the cameraman). The editing though got on my nerves the first time I watched it. The picture changes every 5-6 seconds with fade-in-fade-out transitions. Hardly any time to contemplate the natural beauty. And the camera moves all the time. Imagine: slow pan to the left 5 seconds, fades out, pan right fades in, 5 seconds then it fades out just to let in a zoom out and so on. Looks a bit like those CNN ""sights and sounds"" montage. If you can get used to this, you'll enjoy the presentation. Also, wonderful dvd transfer!"
2,This DVD A Real Snoozer,"There are better Yosemite videos out there if you look for them. This is nice visual wallpaper, but without much substance. If you like slow music video with a less-than-accomplished narrator, this is the title for you."
3,Good Sleepy Time video,"I had to buy this DVD because we just got back from Yosemite and I miss it so! But maybe because the park is so fresh in my mind, this video seemed... slow! Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought it! But I wish it had a few more bright sunny shots with some movement in them! In all fairness, Yosemite is a place that moves you spiritually and this production seems to focus less on the physical and more on the emotional experience of Yosemite. Sit back, sip some espresso, and let the film wrap you inside a soft cocooned. If you're still awake at the end you will have enjoyed some wonderful scenes of what I believe is the most amazing place in the world."
3,Not for the advanced repair work,"I bought this book for Conquest repairs and I also did not find it to be the best companion. It included a lot of info on the Colt and Challenger and I believe the Conquest info belonged more of on it's own do the the vast differences in these cars. I bought it to rebuild the engine and found it fell short and left me looking elsewhere for more detailed info. If your buying it for the Colt or Challenger, I give it a 4. If you want the Conquest/Starion aspect, look to what the mechanics use and get a factory shop manual. much more detail."
1,This guy and his book are a joke,"Typcial of his book is his suggestion of hiding your food in the woods and not to hang a bear bag, since bears would not think to look in the woods for your food. The book was good for many laughs between me and my friends, if you are interested in that, then buy the book."
2,Adequate.....but barely,"If T-Mobile can afford to have the lovely & talented Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas be their spokesbabe, you'd think they could afford to widen their service coverage area. You cannot roam using one of these pre-paid babies, subsequently if you are only slightly off the beaten track, you are S.O.L.Here's my example: Driving down 101 from Oregon, there was NO service for over 400 miles, until Santa Rosa, Ca., & driving up I-5 no service for 200+ miles south of Ashland, Or. Not being accustomed to service as poor as this, I called support, and after being given a run-around to the max, the ""bimbette"" explained I had ""Nation-wide service"", but only in T-mobile's immediate cell areas. Their coverage map shows they only have coverage in tiny areas of North America, chiefly top-50 Metro areas. BTW, when I crossed the border into Canada, there was NO service at all. Don't bother with this."
1,T-Mobile Coverage and Signal suffers,"T-Mobile's prepaid plan isn't confusing as it's similar to Virgin Mobile's, but the coverage is spotty and weak, in my experience. Given Cingular's and Verizon's prepaid are more expensive than T-Mobile's and VM's, and Boost (Nextel)'s coverage isn't on par with VM (Sprint)'s, I'd stay with VM for now, given their good customer service, decent network quality and low cost."
1,Virgin is many times better,"I see absolutely no reason to pick t-mobile as your prepay service provider. Virgin Mobile has a much, much better plan. It has better coverage to boot (using Sprint's national network). Long distance is always included with Virgin. No charge for leaving voicemail or checking voicemail from another phone. Lower per-minute rates (esp. after 10 minutes per day), and includes long distance. And you don't need to recharge for 90 days, plus you get 60-day grace.T-mobile is much worse so I recommend you go with Virgin Mobile if you want pay-as-you-go."
1,I'm really confused,"On the refill card, it says expire in 30 days. But on T-mobile website, it says ""unused minutes are valid for 90 days, except with the $10 card"". Which one is correct? Too confusing.Also I don't think long distance cost more than local calls. T_mobile website says that Nationwide long distance is included in the pay-as-you-go service."
2,Horrible Taste,"I wouldn't know if this product would really work or not. I tried it for about 4 days and just couldn't take it anymore. The taste of Greens Plus is horrible. Also, it felt like I was drinking grass. I suggest trying the pill form for anybody thinking of trying Greens Plus."
4,Little know Joyce DiDonato recording!,"If you have been following the career of this amazingly gifted American mezzo (huge successes in Paris, London, LaScala, Pesaro Rossini Festival in the past two years) you will be for a treat, although she sings on only 2 of the bands of this CD. She sings Rosina opposite Florez at the Met next season. The rest of the CD is excellent."
1,454,"piece of crap,must be very old , works for about 8 hours, i keep my phone on the charger all the time"
5,A Different Perspective on the Tudors,"The Last Boleyn is an enjoyable and captivating read from cover to cover. Although I have read several books on King Henry VIII and the Tudor family, I knew little of Mary Boleyn before reading this book. I appreciate that the author framed the storyline within the boundaries of factual events yet included dialogue and some fictional events to bring the story to life. My only criticism is that a few sections read like a romance novel thereby diluting the storyline. All in all, I highly recommend this book to fans of medieval history."
2,"Okay, but....","The writing itself is done well, but there are too many factual errors that kept annoying me throughout the novel. As mentioned earlier, Mary Tudor is described as having ""raven"" hair, Katharine of Aragon is called the ""Duchess"", not ""Dowager Princess"" of Wales, and Jane Parker is known as Jane Rochford in her maidenhood, when she did not acquire that title until much later and then only through her husband. I also thought having Mary become Francois's mistress before she married and became Henry's was a bit too much. Mary is not as likable as in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". On the whole, I would recommend this book to readers who have already read that title and would like to compare the two."
5,Really liked it,"This book was a pleasant surprise although as stated before there were a few historical discrepancies (not enough to annoy me personally, but enough to notice). I thought the interpersonal relationships she had with all the royals made the characters seem more real and fulfilled my visions of what they should be. I preferred this portrayal of Anne better than Gergorys' The Other Boleyn Girl which made her seem evil."
4,Excellent Story,"This was a very good fictional account of the life of Mary Boleyn. You always read about Anne and George, but little about Mary. The book tells the story of how it was really Mary who set in to motion the families rise to power and how she managed to escape their subsequent fall. I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it to all historical fiction fans."
4,A Tudor soap opera,"Always love anything portraying the soap opera that was the Tudor dynasty. A little bit of a slow start, but picks up nicely and then I had trouble putting it down. Was confused at first at the spelling of Boleyn as Bullen throughout the vast majority of the novel and knew there had to be an explanation, but it didn't come until very close to the end; would have been nice to see a reference to it sooner. I have already read THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Philippa Gregory (one of my favorite books ever and also about Mary Boleyn), but enjoyed this version as well. If memory serves me; however, I believe that the Gregory version portrayed a different outcome in Mary Boleyn's life after being cast aside by King Henry-which is right? This version got a little too romantic for me at times, but nonetheless, enjoyable. I do recommend reading this."
1,Really Bad!,"The only good thing about this movie is that the picture quality is great and the soundtrack is in 5.1 (even though the music is terrible) If you made the mistake of buying this movie, check out the picture of the director in the gallery. He has to be the ugliest human i've ever seen!"
2,nice shoe but not for orthodic,"I have orthodics (inserts) for my shoes and have always been able to put them into a Finn Comfort shoe or sandal. But not these. I could not get my foot into the shoes, there was hardly any clearance between the insert and the top of the shoe. Your foot would have to be very very thin to wear them with any orthodic. I have Clogs and Sandals from Finn Comfort and I love them. And my orthodics are very thin and even taking out the footbeds already in these shoes and putting in mine there was no way I could get my foot into them."
3,For Class,"The book came as promised so everything is good as far as shipping and accuracy. However, the book itself is very boring and dated. I have it for class and that is it, not good reading material and does little to further an understanding of Spanish."
3,Remaster Disaster,"I am a Nyrofanaticnut and I would think remastered would mean producing better quality sound or something. I listened to some of the samples. Well Sony (I guess) has turned out new additions of some of these songs that I do not like. They are not the original sound. I hate when that happens! I wouldn't touch this recording with a 10 foot pole. And by the way, this is exactly why Laura was never a ""star"". She was not into commercialism and the whole music business. She wasn't a star, she was an artist. There are not many people in this world with her freedom."
3,CRACKED CASE,"There's nothing bad to say about Laura Nyro and this fabulous album. But the ""new"" CD arrived in a cracked case, I won't use this seller again."
1,"Laura Nyro, forever","In 1971 when I was 6 yrs old, I'd come home from school and listen with my older sisters to Laura Nyro's ""..Thirteenth Confession"". Now in 2003 and alot older her album is still awesome. For many years I thought Laura was the struggling young woman in NYC, coping with all of life's horrors (and great joys) yet I know now she was a very gifted girl (attended School of Performing Arts?) and lived a comfortable lifestyle. Well, at first a little betrayed, yet any contradictory feeling for Laura goes as soon as I listen to the outstanding music she created. If you've heard the versions of her music that Three Dog Night, Barbra Streisand and the Fifth Dimension performed, do yourself a much needed favor and listen to her originals. Thank you."
1,Don't buy this stuff!,"I like flavored salts. I ordered the truffle flavored salt. I don't know what flavor it is, but it is not truffle and it tastes horrid.I wish there had been a sample of this, but there is not. Bad tasting stuff!"
4,An Excellent Slap in the Face,"I didn't think I'd like it at first, too many emotions, too fast, too much shifting from reality to obscure-dream sequence. But after reading through the book twice, I started to identify with the characters, the mood, the area, and the themes. This is what being young is all about.. and I'm glad someone has written it down in such a raw, immediate way. This book understands reality, and thats the most anybody could ask from a book."
5,M14 Owners Guide.,"An outstanding book containing everything you need to know about your M14/M1A. Maintenance, operation, trouble shooting and preparing the rifle for competition. No M14/M1A owner should be without this book."
4,"Works well, good quality","This is a good 2 (optionally 3) handset cordless phone with digital spread spectrum -- this is rare to find without lots of (expensive) extra bells and whistles. This phone has no answering machine. The design is attractive and the wall-mount was easy. The powerpack for the main unit is rather large and is grey, not white, like the rest of the phone.I don't like the way the wall-mounting of the main unit requires the handset to ""click""-in instead of hang: The plastic piece that holds the phone could easily break. I hope it does not. Ringer options are nice. Voice quality is good and the handsets are lightweight and include a beltclip.The second handset also wall-mounts, but in custom fashion. No screws or plates are included for wall-mounting either handset."
1,Junk,"One of the more important features I was looking for was Call Waiting/CallerID. Well, the phone has been repaired THREE times by Panasonc and the feature still doesn't work. I confirmed numerous times that this feature was turned on through the phone company. I also tested the line with a different phone, and the Call Waiting/CallerID feature IS turned on but the Panasonic phone doesn't agree!"
2,Quality not a strong point,"Seems like a decent phone, but has problems that drive me crazy. It loses connection with the base constantly. Even when I'm next to the base. I go through times when the phone just doesn't work... I unplug & replug everything in, trying to get a signal to the handset. It makes weird cutting in and out noises. I've had it for over a year and am buying a new phone, different brand."
1,It was a good phone while it lasted.,"I bought this phone through Amazon on March 30, 2004 based on the good reviews I read here. The phone worked until May 23, 2004 when it brought down my phone line and I had to have the phone company out to solve the problem. The phone line has been fixed, but the phone is hosed. I use this for my work, so it is a huge inconvenience. I hope Panasonic stands by their product."
1,"NO answering machine, as implied by description!","Upon pulling the phone out of the box, I was shocked to find that this phone system does NOT have an answering machine! I had to go back through my research to figure out that the ""VOICE MAIL MESSAGE INDICATOR LIGHT"" that was listed in the product descriptions is not synonymous with the phone having an answering machine. You have to sign up for an AT&T answering service that you pay for separately as part of your phone bill!!! The product descriptions could be clearer on this point."
4,i liked it,"A good recount of all the pain (much of it self-induced) Berryman went through to be able to find the voice that emerged in the Dream Songs. His childhood, parents, education, heroes, friends, addictions...all of them given appropriate weight in this biography. If you like his poetry, you'll like this book."
1,"Factually Wrong, Hyped Life","From the opening line that Berryman/Smith was 12 (he was 11) when his father committed suicide (doubtful, very doubtful) to the hyped up suicide-of-the-American poet, Mariani portays Berryman's life as a kind of cartoon. Mariani did not go to Oklahoma, where Berryman grew up to age 11, or to Florida where his father (supposedly) committed suicide. His research and documentation are not only suspect but also flat shallow."
2,less than expected,I bought this for my Takamine and disappointed me after my first use. I have a humudifier with hyydro numbers on it and this never matched with that. But I accept the fact it gave me +3-3 numbers so I was OK with it. It comes also with stickers you can sort of put on your bookshelf but they fell down in 2 days.It has a cheesy workmanship and it gives you approximate numbers.Well deserved 2 stars.
5,Accurate Little Hygrometer,"I have two Oasis Hygrometers, one for each guitar case and got the Planet Waves Hygrometer for my new guitar. They are all C.F. Martins, high quality guitars. I found the Planet Waves Hygrometer to be consistent with the readings of the Oasis models give or take a few points.It offers more than the Oasis Hygrometer in that you can log in a set point for humidity. If the humidity drops below your desired level, (45-55% is recommended), a droplet icon will appear indicating the need for more water. The velcro fasteners could be better but I simply put the whole unit in the storage compartment of my hardshell guitar case. Even keeps a log of the past humidity/temp readings in the memory. Well done Planet Waves!"
1,humidity sensor not accurate at all,"I have two same Planet Waves humidity sensors. Don't trust any of them as putting both side by side I have completely different readings of humidity (like 34% versus 25%). Sometimes units having less difference in readings, but had never been less than 3%. This is crap unit with no stability and accuracy. I should mention that Hunidifier itself works fine and I use it as well as Humidity controls pack I have."
5,Incredible Pictures and Ideas,This book gives you ideas for every type of decoration. From country to mexican. All are very original and easy to follow because of the great pictures!
3,"Some Nice Ideas, Inadequate Resource List","I enjoyed the variety of nursery designs presented. Some were quite dated, but most were classic baby rooms. Important safety tips were a plus. I loved some of the decor so much (a hand hooked rug in particular) I planned to buy, but.... the resource list in the back of the book was sadly lacking product information. Product manufacturers were listed for some but not all items. Strangely enough, credit was given to the designer of some rooms, while merchandise information was listed for others. I agree with the reviewer who said there were great ideas, but not necessarily a way to follow through with them at home!"
2,Lots of Info but nothing I didn't already know,"I was hoping to be inspired by this book- get lots of great unique ideas, instead what I got was things I already knew. The pictures look older and very dated look! Not inspired at all, in fact-- I donated it!"
1,Pictures are dated,"I was looking for something to give me nursery decorating ideas. This book has pictures, but most are dated. You'd do better looking at the Pottery Barn Kids catalog."
2,Good ideas but lacks what's needed to follow thru,"Although this book has many cute ideas, it has a resource guide in the back that gives the website or name of only a fraction of the products. I wanted to be able to find the brand and paint color names used as well as a specific bumper and sheet set in a bedroom that would have gone perfectly in the room I'm designing and none of that information was not listed. Very frustrating. I'll keep looking for a better book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this pole, and the birdhouse mount that goes with it. I like to buy American-made products. My opinion is that Droll Yankee needs some serious quality assurance work in their manufacturing. The pole is shaky and the joints need two layers of duct tape wrap to make them fit snugly enough to hold up to mild breezes. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,"Special, surprizing and finest kind","Reactions to Bucknell's seriously sophisticated bourgeois novel span the gamut from tres offended to tres amused to, in the main, whoa, I didn't see that coming (if you're the naive sort of reader I am and it was just perfect!). One of the few books of 2005 to kick my butt.Exceptionally fine reading. Something quite special and surprising. Finest kind."
3,favourite viloin eoncores,"I liked this CD. When Amazon had this music in total orchestral way, please notice me.Sorry, my english is very bad."
2,Too bland - had to add more cheese,"We bought this in a pack of 12 at Costco for a much better price than here. However, it has kind of become a rejected food item in our house. My one year old likes it because it is easy to grab, but even my three year old asks to add more cheese. Once you add some shredded cheese to it, it isn't that bad. Just not a lot of flavor. For the price we prefer Simply Organic Macaroni and Cheese. The flavor is much better and the price is about the same."
5,Best Mac & Cheese out there!,"This is certainly the best mac & cheese around. Unless you just looove Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, Annie's Homegrown is worth a extra dime per ounce. My first batch was not the best, but my 2nd and all the rest were great. I always looked forward to a big bowl of Annie's Mac & Cheese. I forgot to try adding butter, that might make the sauce creamier. I often used only water, or a splash of milk. There are plenty of ways to enhance the sauce if you're looking for a particular consistency, so don't let that deter you from Annie's!"
2,Just what the doctor ordered - B-L-A-N-D,"Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet. Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless. I can't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good. It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting! I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's. This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it."
5,"SIMPLY OUSTANDING, 2ND BEST ALBUM HE HAS MADE",I am a die hard Brian McKnight fan anyway! I love his music. This last album he just came out with is simply slamming! The music just takes you away from all your cares and you feel like he's singing to you. He touches on feelings that we tend to bury when we lose someone. He is just the greatest!
5,Pure Soul....With a Great Voice,"This is the best cd I have heard in a long time. McKnights voice flows over the words dripping with soul and emotion. ""Back at One"" definitely evokes emotions and leaves you longing for more. The rest of the tracks are beautifully done, showcasing his voice on more slow songs. He has to be one of the best performers out there right now...and with this cd, it leaves no doubt he definitely has the best voice."
5,Brian's Best Work Yet!,"Brian has done it again! This is some of his best music ever! If you are a Brian fan and you love to dance, go and get this one - you WILL NOT regret it!"
3,Brian Mcknight Back at One,Brian Mcknight has Great sexuality for any aspiring Young Adult Male; he's a Middle-Aged Man that has a understanding of the Male Ego and knows how to Please a Woman's Sense.
5,Wow..,"all i can say, as im speechless abou this album. I love putting this cd in and hearing the crisp voice of McKnight as he sings ""Last Dance"" to start off the alum. This album boasts a very strong track listing with songs such as ""Back at One"" and sweet love song, ""Home"" frm Stuart Little the Movie, and Lonely, all sweet lulaby songs. I would have o give this the rating of best all time Brian McKnight album. He did a great job putting ths together. This album will make you wanna listen to each song start to finish. Even in years to come youll be rushing back to this cd to just lay back and listen to some r&b."
4,"A ""good"" CD that I would recommend for smooth, easy listenin","This is the only Brian McKnight cd that i own and based on the contents of this one, I have been missing out. I have always liked his music I have heard on the radio, but I never bought his cd's. I like smooth, easy listening music and this cd did not disappoint. McKnights voice is relaxing and with the addition of his outstanding piano skills, he could relax anyone. A few of the tracks on this cd are a little more up tempo which I think is a mistake for Brian McKnight. He is better at the slower more jazzy songs, thus making the upbeat tunes detract from the cd. He is trying too much to be like Babyface when he does things like that. Overall though, this is a good cd and I give it four stars. I am going to go out and get his other cds."
5,His best album commericaly,"R&B lovers and music critics will argue on which CD is Brian Mcknight's best CD. His first features the classic One Last Cry and Never Felt This Way while Back at One featured the huge crossover song Back At One. This album saw McKnight at the height of his career. It sold over 3,000,000 copies within a period of three weeks. It saw cross over success being popular with both black and white markets due to the title song. However there are other strong songs on the CD such as Cherish, Shall We Began and the singles 6,8,12 and Stay Or Let It Go. My personal favorite from the CD though was the ballad Stay."
5,OOOOH LA LA!!!!!,"Brian McKnight is by far my favorite R&B Artist. He is the master of love ballads and he's not bad when it comes to upbeat songs either. I have all of his releases and this one gets top marks right along with the others. I love this man and his music! If you're a lover of ballads, then check out ""Back At One"", ""6,8,12"" and ""Cherish"". For a smoother side of regular hip-hop, there's ""Last Dance"", ""Played Yourself"" and ""You Could Be The One"". What can I say? It's all good! It's Brian at his best. Can't wait 'til the next release."
5,Best Of McKnight's work.,"Review,by Eleftherios Xixis.Finally, Brian McKnight's best. ""Anytime"" was OK, but a lot people know about ""Anytime"" sounding like that other song by D'Ngelo something. There are so many good cuts in this album.(The best in order). 1.Back at One2.Home3.6,8,124.Stay or let it go5.Last Dance. A lot of the reviewers have totally ignored the last cut. ""Home"" is so beautiful, and inspiring, and yep, it made me shed a tear. ""Back at One""is my favorite song here,because the background and McKnight's voice make it a masterpiece.Perfect marriage song, and it's me and my girlfriends song,too.U have to buy it.Brian McKnight is reallyyyy underrated. Isn't it true?Think about it."
5,Brian's songs' are so addictive!,"Back at One as an album is the dominant and best R&B album of 1999 & 2000! Songs particularly Back at One, Home, Cherish, and 6, 8, 12 are breathtaking. I listen to 6, 8 ,12 all the time and memorized the lyrics... they speak to the heart. He is the man!"
4,Brian McKnight is so talented!,"This cd rocks! I love Brian's voice because it is so relaxing. The songs Back At One, Cherish, and Can You Read My Mind are my favorites! They all have beautiful poetry and a wonderful message."
2,Back at One Wasn't That Good,"I was very dissapointed by Brian McKnight's new CD. ""Back At One"" was a great song, but it seemed to be the only good one on the album. He has a great talent, but I think he dissapointed a lot of people with the new CD. I can't wait for the next one."
2,This is what got me interested ........,"I have to admit 6,8,12 is a great song, and some of the others aren't too bad either. But he's just so fond of himself as evidenced by the vocal style, the arrangements, the artwork, that he repels me more than he attracts."
5,Absolutely Awsome!!!,"Brian Mcknight has once again proven that he is an excellent artist. His lyrics, and music have evolved to another level. I have followed his music from his self titled album to Anytime and I truly must confess that back at one is another testimony to the brilliance that is Brian Mckight."
5,"One of the best, if not the best R&B albums of 1999","The album is a collage of all types of music all meshed together. There is country, techno, soul, and of course good old R&B. Brian has gotten down to making HIS music and reached down into his soul. This one's a keeper!"
3,BACK AT ONE,"THIS IS A GOOD CD . I ONLY WISH HE WOULD SPEED UP HIS SONGS SOMETIMES, BUT OTHERWISE A GREAT CD!"
3,Back At one,"I love this song. Brian Mcknight is a superb artist and song writer. His music touches your heart in so many ways. I have every cd that has come out. Mr mcKnight, keep up the excellent work"
5,TOTALLY MINDNUMBING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING!,"I WAS TOTALLY IMPRESSED WITH BRIAN'S LATEST CD. I FIRST HEARD THE SONGS ON THE RADIO AND FELL IN LOVE. A FRIEND OF MINE HAS THE ALBUM AND SAD TO SAY, SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE DESTROYED THROUGH OVERUSE. I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH BRIAN AND AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT HE'S MARRIED.WAY TO GO BRIAN! I LOVE YOU."
1,I wasted my money...,Is it me or all the songs sound the same?... I was expecting a lot more out of this CD... Now I am wondering if he really knows how to sing.. If you want really talent check Marc Anthony's CD; Marc really knows how to sing love songs..
4,"Fresh New Music From the ""Knight""","I enjoyed the ""Back at One"" album. It is a fresh new flavor from Brian McKnight. It is an ample mixture of fast and slow. My favorite track is number 13, ""Home"". I originally bought the album because I heard this track and enjoyed it, but I ended up loving the entire album."
2,"I'll stick with ""Anytime""...","""Back at One"" pales in comparison to Brian McKnight's last 3 albums. The songs have less substance and less variety between them. Brian is starting to sound like everything else played on the radio..."
2,I would only recommend this CD to to the CD collector,"""Back At One"" has to be Brian McKnights worse CD. If you've listened to his first two CD's you too would understand. This CD lacks the true creative talents that he embodies. The title song ""Back At One"", ""6,8,12"", and ""Cherish"" are so similar I thought he had Timberland doing the tracks (listen to Ginuwine's CD's). But, I guess nowadays that's main stream pop music for you. On the bright side, ""Home"" has to be the best song on the CD which is as close to vintage Brian McKnight as you will get. But let's not forget, I'm just a music lover. What do I possibly know about quality music?"
2,Pop goes the Weasel,"The Chicago Bulls would never trade Jordan, but for some reason Brian M. has traded his one of kind style for pop apeal. I've seen BM in concert and I know that he is the real thing. Yet he went away from what most of his fans have come to love him for. I do really enjoy tracks 2 and 4 though. IF YOU READ THIS BRIAN: Please don't do a Whitney Houston on us and flip-flop for the pop charts. p.s: What ever happened to solo piano songs?"
3,"This album doesn't cross my mind -- ""anytime.""",Lackluster songs compared to his prior album. Big disappointment from a man who can definitely sing!
1,customer review,"Brian, I just want to congradulate you on successful (album back at one) we South Africans love it and we hope you willvisit our lovely country and maybe have some shows. We sincerly hope that you will come to our province Eastern Cape."
1,This CD is a huge disappointment!,"I ran out to buy this cd because I feel that Brian Mcknight is a true r&b singer, however, I was very disappointed. The songs were all very short with no real sing to me lyrics. I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your $$ and go buy Eric Benet."
5,Professional quality R&B,"When I first heard ""Back At One,"" I wondered who sung it...then I found out it was the same singer who sings the beautiful ""One Last Cry."" I bought the album, and was impressed to discover its musical and romantic quality. This is beautiful R&B--you can definitely witness his musical skill, and the way the songs capture your mind. I just wish I had a girlfriend to dedicate some of the songs to! I now have a new appreciation for people who make their own music, instead of just relying on producers while they just put on an act. Go Brian McKnight!"
3,"Low-risk, low-gain","Brendel plays the Beethoven sonatas with a great deal of care and gives thoughtful performances across the board. Everything sounds meticulously planned, down to the last trill. Brendel's technique is occasionally pushed to the limit but generally holds up quite well.The real problem is that these begin to sound like cookie-cutter interpretations after a while. For more engaging performances, try Sviatoslav Richter (especially the ""Richter in Leipzig"" CD) or Artur Schnabel. In terms of more recent recordings, Maurizio Pollini takes a relatively straight interpretive approach but does a better job of bringing the music to life than Brendel does here."
3,Live recordings mixed,"Although Brendel indicated that putting live recordings in this set was his intention, I do not like low sound quality of live recordings. The complete cycle set like this should be all recorded at well prepared recording studio.Alfred Brendel's name is on the Bosendorfer Imperial owner list. I would like to hear these sonatas played on his own piano."
3,Lipkin is much more reliable,"Brendel plays as though the period movement never existed. He plays like he played in the 1960s, insisting that Beethoven MUST have a slow movement in each and every sonata. Take opus 10 #2 in F, specifically the Allegretto movement. Brendel crucufies this movement by playing it dead slowly. Yet Beethoven clearly had in mind a spritely dance-style movement -- otherwise, why mark it ""Allegretto""? But Brendel, self-indulgently, knows better than Beethoven. My own current favorite for the sonatas as a whole is Seymour Lipkin, who at least is able to differentiate between tempi. Kovacevich is also very good. Brendel certainly brings great focus to the music, but sadly he is misguided and, one has to say, blissfully(?) ignorant."
3,lacking,"I find Brendel's interpritations of beethoven lacking. Basically I think it is good to the ears to hear him play, but his interpritations are very plain. This is good to listen to if you don't have a very wide understanding of Beethoven. Personally I recommend Vladimir Ashkenazy who plays the best Beethoven I have ever heard (especially in the later sonata's). You really should try listening to Ashkenazy's recordings of the Beethoven's sonatas."
2,Go with Kempff,"The late Wilhelm Kempff was a much better pianist, more in touch with Beethoven's musical intent, and the complete sonatas are available for less than half the price of these inadequate interpretations of Brendel.For the preferred Kempff interpretations;Beethoven: The Complete Piano Sonatas"
3,Neat but not very useful,"I got 2 of these so that I may have a stero effect. They work pretty well, just have to make sure that the suction is turned tight on the surface. The sound is not very loud even when you turn the volume to high, and of course the quality is not like your music players, but it is quite handy and it goes with any portable players.I think the occasion is the hardest to find for its usage, because I would mostly like have something better to play my music with, at home or in a car, etc. So far, I only got to use it once for a small party at someone's place and I brought it along to play my MP3 for a game. And that was all."
3,"Neat toy, not much else","The SoundBug is neat in concept, but fails in practical execution. There's not much to it function wise. You plug it into a line-out of your audio source and attach it to a smooth surface with the suction cup. The point of the device is to turn that surface into a speaker. Some surfaces work better than others, but overall the effect is very underwhelming.It just feels very under-powered. Conciderring the price and size I'm not very surprised. It does have a novelty that makes it fun trying to find better results from different materials, but at the end of the day the sound quality is so poor, and low that you would never consider actually using it as a speaker, making it just another trinket that sits to throw into the junk drawer."
2,"cool idea, not powerful enough though","i had a hard time with this little bugger at first. couldn't get it to work with my transistor radio, but finally got it to work with my CD player. advice? make sure the surface is FLAT and somewhat spacious. the sound isn't that great, but what do you expect for $17? the sound is very ""tinny"" and not very impressive. it's a cool idea, but i am sure sure just how useful this thing is. i really have no idea what i am going to do with mine to tell you the truth. ;)"
3,Unitended usefulness,I had a couple of these but they fell a few times and broke. When they weren't broken I used them to talk through windows at staff who tried to ignore me. They were used with Radio Shack stereo listeners as amplified microphones. I needed to contact personell in closed offices but when they heard me calling them by name they opened the door and stopped trying to hide. Perhaps the soundbug could be used by search and rescue teams. Too bad you can't get them anymore.
2,Not bad for just wanting to listen,"If you aren't a sound snob, and just need a way to listen to your ipod while doing dishes or just sitting around the house this isn't a bad purchase. There isn't much bass and the sound is tinny, but for wanting some music to listen to while in the shower or what not... it isn't a bad purchase."
4,Great item,"We had one of these speakers for home and wanted one for the office. It took awhile to find this, but it was worth it - and fast shipping, too!"
4,"Wonderful toy; well made, but very small","Great toy but much smaller than I expected. Board is 4.75"" square and pegs are 5/8"" long. My 20 month old enjoys playing with it (under adult supervision.)"
3,Need more sizes,"I bought these for my wife because they looked hot and slutty. They are indeed hot and slutty but unfortunately the whole ""one size fits most"" is an over statement. My wife is a dress size 8 and these things were SUPER tight. She got in them but it doesn't look very comfortable. There's no stretch to them at all so unless your gal is petite, buy something else."
4,Outfreakingstanding,"If you see somebody wearing this, what there is of it, it won't be on for long. In fact you can keep it on too, this just oozes fun literally."
2,It's tiny!,"The item arrived as described and timely. 5 stars to vendor. Product, though I knew it was very small, was much too small for my liking!"
5,Very enjoyable mystery with a country-western setting,"Extremely enjoyable mystery with a country-western setting. Contains the full lyric of ""If it ain't fried, it ain't food"", itself worth the price.Does anyone out there know the name of another Westlake book in which the main character, a film critic and college teacher of film courses, inadvertently causes the death of his date for the evening in his apartment. The book features a running gag in that all his books have titles in the familiar modern vein, Title: Subtitle, for example, ""Gaza Strip: Breeding Ground for Terrorism"". You get the picture. Can anyone help? Thanks."
3,Not a great trail saw,"I had hopes this saw. Nice size, comes with a nice sheath, cool looking - but it's not a great choice for trail work. It doesn't cut aggressively and it tends to bind a couple on inches in to the cut. Perhaps it's due to it's dual use design as a bone and big game saw as well as for trail work. It does ok, but wouldn't be my first choice for cutting green wood."
3,Fazzolari is Fabulous!,"Clifford Fazzolari is an awesome writer. After reading Desperation, I couldn't wait to get my hands on another one of his books. Waldorf & Juli is a nice, warm-hearted, and witty novel. Fazzolari shows us how love conquers all. It was a nice change of pace for me and I can't wait to read more of his fabulous tales!"
4,reasonable price for a good performance,Very cost efficient and a nice turkish translator. It has all the basic phrases and is quite user friendly!
3,Not a home run!,"If you are looking for one device that ""does it all"", this ""ain't it"". Specifically, for Russian, as i am a beginner, there is no way i can pronounce what words I see. This device does not have phoenitic spelling and would recommend a device that would have it for the tough languages (Russian, Polish, Chinese, Japanese). Ok for Spanish, French and German, where you basically can speak what you read."
1,"Good for dining, but nothing else","Like many of the other reviewers, I found this item nearly useless. The one thing it does do fairly well is tell you what various foods are called. It might be useful for eating out. For any other purposes, buy a pocket dictionary, they are faster, cheaper, and have more definitions."
2,Red Flag,"For those of you that study romance languages, you know that a translator that doesn't deal with articles is USELESS. For instance, if I wanted to translate ""Book"" into German, I should get ""das Buch"" and not just ""Buch"", because i won't be able to properly say any sentences without the article. This machine does not appear to offer or understand articles. I e-mailed the company's customer section, and they have not gotten back to me (it's been over two weeks). Also, for a class I am reading a young author book, and out of every ten words I look up, even in the infinitive form in the case of verbs, I've been lucky to get two responses. I'm getting awfully sick of the ""Sorry, can't help"" message. However, when it DOES manage to translate something for me, it hasn't yet given me an incorrect definition, as I have checked them with my paper dictionary."
4,12 Language Pocket Translator,"This is a handy item when traveling in Europe and the Americas. It even has language help for most of Eastern Europe.It was challenging to enter the Cyrillic characters when visiting Russia, but it did the job. A pocket translator is no substitute for familiarity with a language, but it beats carrying several language dictionaries with you.It would be nice to know how much battery life was left."
2,Not Very Useful,"This translator has a very limited vocabulary. Many common words could not be translated. After having this item for only a couple of weeks, the battery has died.We only used it a few times.Don't waste your money on this item."
3,Fragile and complicated,"its very cheap and fragile.. its very tempting to just break the top cover off.. its almost loose. Seems to translate most of the words, but very very complicated - operation wise - Took me a while to understand it. I bought this for my mother who is learning english and i know she will not know how to operate it. But overall - its the best one i could find for the money, online."
1,Lost my money on a piece of junk,"I bought this on the eve of my trip abroad. Poor thing... it refused to turn on after being turned on fewer than five times during my outbound flight. Needless to say I was never able to actually use it during my trip on land, so I basically had an extra piece of plastic in my backpack. When I came back home -- you guessed it -- it was too late to return it. Bottom line: I lost my purchase money, with agony and frustration added for free."
1,Total Lemon,"It seemed like this device was going to be very useful, despite some of the complaints mentioned by others such as difficulty locating common words. My biggest problem is that the thing stopped working two days into my trip to France. I should have just purchased a good old-fashioned pocket dictionary. Luckily I had an abbreviated French textbook with me or I would have really been in trouble. Bought new batteries and still nothing. Completely disappointing. Do not buy this product if you want something reliable."
2,More vocabulary needed,We used this on our first trip to Germany and many common items and phrases are not included in the vocabulary.
1,Pas plus bon,"Considering the cost of this item, it did little to enhance my french vocabulary experience while travelling in France last month. I consider my french to be quite stale and hoped that it would help with commonly used french words, but was disappointed with ""no result found"" most of the time a french or english word was entered for translation."
2,Not quite what expected,"After reading the reviews thought this would be perfect for our upcoming trip to Europe. It arrived in a very timely manner, just a few days prior to our trip. Decided we would practice using it on our long flight. Upon doing so, realized that you cannot type in words and have it translate. You type in your phrase or word and it will pick up key words and give you its suggested canned phrases. Did not find it to be very helpful at all."
1,tg-45- 12,"It is not user freindly and very complicated. I am not happy with it. I even had help trying to decifer it. Bad investment. By the way I am 74 and computer literate, learned computers begining in 1970""s."
1,waste of money,"Not very user friendly, limited vocabulary, finally threw it away when it got stuck on Turkish which was a language I have no use for. Hope there is a better product out there as the concept is good."
1,Franklin tg-450,"This is very poor translator. i can not understand how 450000 word included in it, because plenty of simple words not in translator.Franklin can do something really better!!!"
5,Review for a translator.,"Very light weight, slim, quite convinient to use. It is good to have this gadget while travel."
3,Okay for Travel Not for Study,"I purchased the dictionary to use on my comprehensive exam but still had to use a bound dictionary reference because it did not have so many words. Also it sometimes would change letters in order to produce anything at all. It's definitely not for those who know very little French or any of the other two languages on the device. Also if you're using it for travel you can't put in a whole phrase, you have go word by word, which sucks because phrases often mean something completely different from their word by word translation."
2,below average,"It's not productive, it doesn't translate phrases, a lot of times doesn't even translate single words"
5,Christmas gift for student,I have a Franklin spell check and have used it for years. The Franklin products are outstanding and I am pleased to give this translator to my granddaughter for Christmas. I know she will use it for a long time to come.Franklin TG-450 12 Language Translator
4,I LOVE this thing!,We have a girl from Russia staying with us this summer and this thing has been invaluable! I really am surprised that some others have given it a bad review. I'd say 95% of the words that we have looked up have been found. It is a great little tool that is very easy to use. Anyone considering buying a translator should seriously consider this. It is a great buy!
1,Franklin TG-450 Review,"On the face of it, a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, this device is utterly useless as a translator from a language which generally does not classify nouns by gender (e.g. English) to one that does (e.g. French).The gender is of course, part of the noun. The TG-450 gives only a partial translation ie no gender. The implications should be obvious to any student of language.I find it amazing that a supposedly reputable company like Franklin should market a product with such a glaring deficiency.For non-English speakers it might be slightly more useful, but not much. For example, many French nouns are dual gender. Maybe the TG-450 can differentiate between `le cave' - meaning `idiot' and `la cave' - meaning `basement'. I didn't keep my long enough to find out. The fact is, it is not a translator but an overpriced and useless gimmick. Buy a pocket dictionary."
2,How not to do it.,Hard to use. Does not show gender in French!!! Has outdated features and lacks customization in several areas where it is needed. Feels and looks like something that has been re-cycled from a previous translator.I need it for the odd word in Italian - if there were any other choice I would not use it. If it were more expensive I would send it back.Took it with me to Italy. Useless! Langenscheidt's small dictionary does a much better job at 1/3 the price!!
5,European Translator Great,"I have been using my translator since it arrived to look up words and phrases for an upcoming trip to Europe. It's wonderful. It not only gives words, but many, many helpful phrases, related questions, etc.I recently received a catalogue from a high priced store which offered a similar one with only 10 languages and cost $199.00. Amazon's price....$29.99....AND I got free shipping!!! I just loved the whole experience."
3,"A good, cheap compromise","Not great, but, it came in handy during our 3+ weeks in Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.Although it claims 400,000 words and phrases, it felt like many fewer than that. Even if one assumes that the 400,000 words and phrases are the total for all languages, it felt like less than 30,000+ words and phrases/language. We found that there were many common words and phrases which weren't found in the dictionary. The limited dictonary and phrases were a disappointment, but, not having to carry 4 dictionaries partially made up for that lack.The fact that the results aren't displayed phonetically made for several puzzled looks as we mispronounced the results of the search.A more expensive solution might have proven a better choice, but, for the money, this was a good cheap compromise."
2,broke in 2 hrs!,"While it worked, it seemed pretty good, I started playing hangman and after that it went crazy- letters wouldn't delete and would keep adding more instead of deleting. I found many useful phrases-that is why I am giving it 2 stars, I will try another one for this reason, so let's see if this one works."
2,"bad, can't find simple words","Even the most basic functions range from difficult to impossible. The translator can't find basic words. Seems like a great idea, but is pretty much a waste of money."
2,"Disappointed - Conversion is for DM, and not Euros","I was very disappointed with this product because its currency conversion is for Deutsche Marks. The current official currency for Germany are Euros now. If the product description had listed the conversion was for Deutsche Marks I would not have purchased this particular product, so I feel the description was a little misleading. I would have paid more for a device that had the ability to convert the USD to the Euro. So I am stuck with a product that I am unhappy with. I'd love to exchange this for the product that I really need."
2,weak-slow,I bought this for Spanish language and it is so slow that it would be impossible to use it for conversation. It has helped me translate several easy words but most times this translator could not find an answer to words. Onboard Hangman game is fun to pass time.
3,not good for Russian,I'm not proficient with the cyrillic alphabet. I would put in the English word and the answer would come out in cyrillic. No help to me at all. I tried figuring out the cyrillic input to try Russian to English and could not find 3 of the essential cyrillic letters. By the time I left Russia I felt illiterate! Do not buy if you are an English speaker wanting help with russian.
3,franklin tg-450 language translator,This a basic translator and does not have everything that you will need when travelling. Sometimes there are so many choices to a words translation it takes forever to know whichone will work if at all. Stil Ifounf it easy to use and was helpful. The currency changing feature was used the most however.
2,Franklin TG-450,"I was sooooo excited to receive the Franklin TG-450 12 Language Translator, that as soon as it came in the mail, I immediately opened it and followed the instructions to begin using this language translator. Boy was I surprised when NONE of the words of phrases I typed in the translator to be translated from English to German were in there! Simple words like eat, bathroom, dog, cat.... you know, the things we need to find our way in another country! Well, needless to say, I returned the product the very next day and I guess I will be going to Germany without a language translator--wish me luck!"
3,Travel help,"Helpful travel phrases loaded. Doesn't do translations really; one needs to choose phrase and then adapt that choice to what one wants to say. Didn't translate step-sister, but did translate brother-in-law."
5,Fun little gadget,This was a fun gadget to send to France with my son and daughter-in-law ! They loved it and found it very helpful-even in deciphering street signs. Good value for the money.
4,Franklin TG-450 good buy for the money,"The vocabulary is limited, as it must be considering the ambitious goal of including so many languages. I've used it with Portuguese and Spanish clients during real estate closings and it has helped. Certainly it hasn't replaced the kind interpreter sitting at the table but it lets people know I'm trying. If I were traveling in Europe, however, I would probably spring for a more expensive but more extensive translator."
4,My english spanish translator,"I find it very useful, specially when I read english literature. In few seconds I'm able to get the translation of most words. Of course, deep and dificult texts have also rare words and I would need a translator with more than a million words but it is a good balance between price and capacity. I recomend it!"
2,Buy the better ones,"This unit can help you get by, but you'll be much better off with a higher end talking model.Very limited vocabulary (at least in Polish), does not recognize many common words. Tenses confuse it, as does use of a word as a modifier.No phonetic cues, limited use for Slavic languages for sure.If you have a laptop, netbook, Windows mobile platform, smart phone, or Palm device, look at the Lingvosoft talking software available right here on Amazon. It works really well."
2,A LIttle MORE THAN Disappointing,This is really pretty much useless to anyone who is serious about languages ... the more she uses it the more she is frustrated with the bad results she gets to even common words. There are much better FREE translators on line.Franklin TG-450 12 Language TranslatorMy niece loves languages. For her birthday she wanted a translator - this would be her first ... although she selected it she did not realize that it was so limited in what it provided.This is an okay item but not good enough for someone who wants to work with anything above a basic set of words.I would have retunred this item and bought her a more expensive one butthe item comes packed in a plastic clam shell so there is no way of trying this and returning it if you do not like it because the packaging has been opened .... this would be my greatest complaint.
1,Very Basic,"I bought the Franklin TG-450 12 Language Translator for my wife. She is taking spanish classes and didn't want to carry a dictionary in her purse. Once we got the package in the mail, we quickly realized that the language translator was of little use. It doesn't conjugate words since it only gives you the orignal stem. Moreover, its lack of vocabulary is unimpressive. We had to refer to the dictionary 9 out of 10 times when looking for a word. It now collects dust on our book shelf. If you are serious about learning a language, either buy a more expensive translator or a pocket dictionary."
3,the naked truth,I like the movie and the main reason I bought the movie. is because of Shannon Tweed. I think she is a great actress and model.
4,The Winter Soldier,"This is a typical Diana Palmer read,Lisa the couragous and struggling widow and Cy an ex soldier for hire. Lisa need protection and help with the death of her husband by a ruthless drug lord and Cy is seeking revenge on the drug lord she needs protection from. Lisa is sweet and naive and Cy has seen to much of a bad world. The chemistry beteewn Cy and lisa is great, these too are well matched. As with all Diana Palmer heroine Lisa is a little too naive, she is the last to realized she is not pregnant by her dead husband, even though she has none of the symptoms of being pregnant. I could not understand why she was not seing a doctor after she was diagnosed incorrectly? Most pregnant women have regular schedule with their doctors.While I had some issue with the way Lisa pregnancy was written, Diana Palmer never disapoint, she manage to give us a good romance with mystery and adventure."
5,One of her best stories,"Always intrigued by Cy and this story completes his story. Like the inclusion of all of her other characters. Waiting for the rest of the their stories, esp. O'Rourke's."
5,Very Exciting Romance,Another wonderful story by Palmer. This had lots of excitement. Great characters.
3,not the best but okay,"Heroine in this book is widowed,in danger and ""pregnant"".Hero stubborn , sexy and strong.Married to protect her, but the story gets hanged up on thefact that she so native and not pregnant by herbad late husband but the good new guy as if the child would be bad because of his parent. Good at times."
5,The best record of 99..seriously,"Ein Warnsignal an alle unschuldigen Frauenherzen: Sergent Garcia, der Don Juan des Salsas, geht auf die Pirsch. Lässig eilt er durch die Gassen, protzt im weissen Anzug und schwingt in den Händen einen Blumenstrauss. Auf der Suche nach dem Abenteuer, ungezwungen charmant und zwanghaft untreu. Dabei geht er mühelos als Sieger aus der Musik-Balz des Sommers '99 hervor. ""Un Poco Quema'o"" ist das schönste Album des Jahres. Mit verspielten Salsa-Pianos, melancholischen Melodien und coolen Ragga-Muffins wickelt der Sergent - übrigens ein ehemaliges Mitglied Mano Negras - die Hörer um die Finger und zieht sie mit in einen Taumel rastloser Lebenslust. ""Un Poco Quema'o"" ist ein Erntedank-Fest der Liebe."
2,Panasonic On The Cheap,"After having used an older Panasonic cordless happily for the past ten years, I was really disappointed by this product's performance. The call quality was significantly lower -- even the dial tone was weak -- right out of the box. The answering system's playback of messages had the same problem; the messages were hard to hear, and volume control didn't address the issue. Sad to say, the whole set-up went back after a week of use -- and poor performance."
1,Annoying Buzzing sound from day 1!,"I received my phone a yesterday, I charged it a full 24 hours, went to use it and there is an annoying buzzing sound on both phones. It is so frustrating and loud. I am very disappointed! I will NEVER buy Panasonic again. I am sending this back ASAP and going to try a different phone. Beware of this phone, save yourself some hassle and go with a different brand."
1,Don't buy this junk,Don't buy this phone It only lasted about 3 months and we had troulbe with them. We will stop buying all Pana products because this is the 2nd product that has not lasted to long from Pana.
5,Just what I needed,"I was originally looking at a Uniden phone. However, some friends of mine told me to stay away from Uniden and VTech. They both endorsed Panasonic.The phone installed easily and has a wealth of features. I like the fact that you don't need more than 1 phone jack and can plug the second handset into any outlet.Pros:Phone functions very well; calls are clearSpeakerphone option works great when you need both hands free or multiple parties need to speak.Answering machine works well.Great battery life (with power-level indicator)The only con is the fact that the phone is so slim, you'll crane your neck more to hold it against your shoulder. If you'll be on for a while, use the speakerphone option instead."
2,WEARS OUT FAST!!!,Great phone at first but now one and a half years later three buttons don't work on both handsets. Same problem as other guy had!
2,Bad support,"I absolutely loved this phone for 6 months. Then one day, one of the handsets stopped working. I changed batteries with the other handset, the battery was fine, the handset just died.I called support and waited 20 minutes before I could talk to someone. They told me to send the whole set (including the base and both handsets) to Texas, and they would send me a refurbished one.I would have to buy a new phone because the process would take two weeks (a long time to be without a phone), and I would have to pay for the shipping.So I decided to go with the single working handset, instead of sending it. It will be a long time before I trust Panasonic again."
3,goodphone but not adequate caller id feature,"For the price of this phone, it has very good features except caller ID. Don't expect it to be like cellphone where you can save the phone number and put any name you like in the directory to identify the caller. If someone call from a cell phone, it will list ""out of area"" and the phone number will be displayed. You can save the number and put the name in directory. However, when that number calls again, it will list ""out of area"" rather than the name you just put in.Also, the directory can't be shared between each cordless phone. So, you'll have to enter the same names and numbers in all the cordless phones you have."
1,ECHO & HISSS,Well I got this phone and I am not keeping it! WHY?The answering machiene echos and the clairty it NOT THERE!It hisses in the backround! The only thing that was nice about this phone is that it is expandable.I had a KX-TG2500 series and just loved it. I now need a phone with an answering machiene and thought it would be nice to have a expandable system so I got this one! What a mistake!My Panasonic 2500 series is much better that I have had for 3 years so I went out and bought a panasonic KX-TG2583B and just love it! NO ECHO OR HISS!...
1,Destroyer of Wireless Lans,I am embarrased how my Panasonic Phone Totally destroys 802.11 Wireless Lans... My neighborhood is full of Wireless Lans and 2.4ghz phones causing friction and anger in neighborhood. I and some of my neighbors are THROWING AWAY the 2.4ghz phones for 900mhz phones that co-exist with Wireless Lans..Panasonic should warn on the lable of the box that the 2.4ghz phone will cause your Neighbors to HATE you.... Nothing but trouble not knowing that the 2.4ghz phone causes more grief than benefit... Wish I know this before I wasted my Money on the 2.4Giga Range phone. Had to disconnect it. Waste of my money and just makes all my neighbors Mad...
4,For Graduate level audience,"In most electromagnetism texts, dielectric materials receive cursory attention. There is usually little description, beyond a table of dielectric constants for various materials. But in engineering/materials science, there is often need for a more indepth treatment.Which is what the authors provide. They start with the basic properties of dielectrics and develop the often neglected theory. It is nice to see this comprehensive treatment. The emphasis here is on a macroscopic scale. The typical audience for this book has no need for a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment. The analysis can be considered a good excursion into applied electromagnetism. Remember your Maxwell's Equations!"
1,Not enough info !!!!,"I am interested in this product but I wont buy anything that gives me no info about it. Buying a product you know nothing about is just stupid, and i'm not....."
3,eh,The spiral is broken and the book (listed as great condition) was in horrid condition.But it still reads the same.. I should have expected the worst with a used book.
3,old version,This was an older version of the book. OK but overpriced and took a long time to arrive. New version is much better.
5,Everything promised,I received this book within a week of order confirmation. It was in more excellent shape than had been described. I am very happy with the book and the seller! Thank you!
1,way too expensive for quality of product,"It is a great book in general. Unfortunately, I received a very old and more than used copy. The previous owner obviously spilled coffee or something on it and it is totally discolored from the sun. I am not sure this copy it worth more than $5 but I paid about triple that price. I would not have bought it in this condition."
3,Very Basic and Flawed,"This is a very basic musculoskeletal text. The line drawings are quite amateurish and two dimensional. The text contains more than a few technical (OIAI) errors, which have persisted through nearly 20 years of revisions. Much better musculoskeletal texts are available at a comparable price."
1,Can't plug in ear phones,Nice case if it fit the ipod nano. Once the case is on you can't plug in in your earphones. I will return this product.
1,Nano Hard case,"I purchased this case for the nano ipod and it hold the ipod, but when you go to plug in your earphones while the ipod is in the case, the plug will not fit. the case is not contoured correctly. the earphones we are using the the ones that came with the nano. This item will be returned."
5,The CD/DVD = an epic masterpiece!,"This live cd and dvd has all of sonata arctica's classical metal songs such as: victoria secret, 8th commandments, black sheep... And I must say when it comes to production these guys don't screw around about that, The sound and video production was top notch but most importantly the music was a top notch neo classical metal style and it belongs in every metal heads collection.\m/ stay metal \m/"
4,,"This is a greatest hits package performed entirely in concert to a crowd of rabid Tokyo fans. It chronicles the band's very best songs from their debut album to their latest good Reckoning Night effort. It is a great treat for fans and a decent introduction to people who aren't familiar with the band. Sonata Arctica plays a style of happy metal, which unlike the rest of this particular genre, it isn't cheesy and doesn't embarrass itself. For one thing, there's a high degree of musicianship in the material and they also know how to craft powerful songs that you'll remember for a long time. The CD contains 15 songs, while the DVD comes with 20, as well as a short bonus featurette. It features the band on their road to Japan, from their arrival at the airport to their visits to some Japanese clubs, all while being silly and drunk. The good Metal life, indeed..."
2,"Bottom-of-the-line system, obsolete for years.","These Lorex systems are okay for what they are, which is an all-in-one system in a box. This is called an ""observation system"" to separate it from the genuine CCTV security systems that use interchangeable cameras, cables, etc. This type uses a 6-pin DIN plug for the cameras which provides power to the camera and receives video & audio back. Once you install it, you are locked into using this brand when parts start going out. And the surprise? It's no longer available so there are no parts. I'm very surprised to see this on sale, it hasn't been available in some time. I'm even more surprised to see the price of $500 which was retail 10 years ago when these were in stores. Look around some more and you'll find used color systems for a lower price."
5,A great Grainger anthology,"If you want everything Grainger wrote for orchestra and chorus, the Hickox series on Chandos is indispensible. But if you're looking for a good sampling of Grainger's musical style, then this CD by John-Eliot Gardiner is just the thing. I really like JEG's way with most of the selections. Brigg Fair, Seventeen Come Sunday, Shallow Brown and several others are well-known works, and JEG does a fine job with those, joined by a top-notch chorus and sharp orchestral accompaniment. There are also a few lesser-known works on the CD, including the Foster Tribute -- one of the most amazing and intriguing arrangements of Foster melodies you're ever likely to hear ... and at more than 11 minutes in length, it's almost a mini tone-poem for chorus and orchestra.Buy this for a nice sampling of Grainger's special musical style ... then if the spirit moves, go for the whole enchilada over on Chandos -- all nine or ten volumes' worth!"
3,Stickers,"Ordering, and receiving was an easy process. Product came in a reasonable time and in good shape except o one side of the helmet the decal is lower than it should be. This is Riddell's fault, not Amazon's. It probably oly happens once every great while, just sucks it had to be the one they grabbed for me. Where's the QA/QC Riddell???"
5,Very Happy,I received both of the helmets that I ordered in the time frame I was given and in great condition. I am very pleased and I plan to order others in the future.
1,My betta doesnt like this flaky food,"he won't eat this food, so it just dirties the tank. i recommend sticking with the pellets."
4,Good Ramp but Not for Use in Most Cars!,"I bought this for my 10 year old, 80 lb dog who is arthritic and diabetic. I have a Mazda hatchback; without a ramp it is very difficult for her to haul herself up into the back seat.I gave this ramp four stars but that is only for the product & the company itself (ie construction, perceived durability, quick shipping, etc...) NOT for the usefullness of the product, at least in my car, which is not an SUV or particularly high. I give it two stars for usefullness and ease of use.The ribbed surface has good traction and the construction seems good. This ramp is too short to be used to climb into the hatchback. The angle is too steep and there is no ""lip"" to secure it. But, the ramp is too wide to fit in the rear door so we just cannot use it. I will try to make use of it in the house or back porch. I recommend going to a store to try this out before purchasing."
2,Less than satisfied,"Although this product is relatively lightweight, it is too short and therefore too steep for use out the back end of a minivan. My dog won't walk up or down it. It would have been nice if it was longer and folded up or expanded."
4,A family history that also tells the history of Vietnam.,"The Sacred Willow is an excellent family biography and historical analysis of the origins of, and events surrounding, the Vietnam War. If you have shied away from histories of Vietnam as you are not interested in military history, I would highly recommend this work. This book is a social, rather than a military, history. Tracing the history of Vietnam from the era of the mandarins, through the French colonialization, through the communist insurgency, to the fall of Saigon and beyond, the author writes a history of her own family and in so doing, beautifully and subtly details the complexities and nuances of the origins of the Vietnam conflict and America's participation therein. The author's use of spare and straightforward prose enables the reader to look beyond the sheer horror of the war and its aftermath and reach a level of understanding as to how this tragic conflict could have occured."
2,Not enough power,I bought the Maverick grinder and tried it out. I had a hard time with most meat because of lack of power. It jammed over and over again. I had to take it apart to remove everything. What a mess. I bought the Villaware unit from another retailer with 320 watts (100 more than the Maverick) and a reverse switch. It (was the same price). Wow. What a difference. This unit seemed to have twice the power of the Maverick. There is nothing this thing can't handle and no more jamming. If it does I just hit the reverse switch and no more jammin'.
1,Not satisfactory,"The item that I purchased was so poorly packaged that it arrived with several pieces missing. I requested a refund, but have not heard back from the seller for several days. The item is unusable, and now I have a lengthy process to try to recoup my losses. I will never buy an item this way again."
1,Waste of time - Not Funny,I rented this movie from Redbox for 50 cents after a promo code and all I can say is that I want my money back. It was not funny. I wish I had read reviews before I rented it and I'm posting this review hoping it helps keep someone from buying it. Predictable and often repetitive in plot and one stereotype after another. I worked at a Scout camp and my experiences were funnier than what the script provides. Save your time - save your money and get another movie.
2,Disappointing,"After discovering the red hot band Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, I was looking forward to listening to more Western swing music. Milton Brown is the name most frequently mentioned after Bob Wills. Most of this is NOT western swing - most of it is early Western music or pop songs done Western style. There are a handful of pieces that may be historically important because you can hear Brown beginning to combine jazz and Western but I ended up not putting one of these songs into my ipod - they weren't that enjoyable. Historically important? Maybe? Enjoyable and timeless? I don't think so."
3,A mixed bag,"This video tape contains the first two episodes of the fifth season of Babylon Five. The two episodes pretty much sum up the fifth season: a grab bag. ""No Compromises"" was pretty much of a let down as it let too many questions dangling (eg. how is the Alliance constituted, who pays to keep it running, etc). ""Very Long Night"" however is pretty much to strongest episode of the season. Can't really find much fault with it and it keeps going right up until Londo's tearful apology to G'Kar."
5,dope album,"this cd has some great beats. will.i.am is a genius. i would say 9 of the possible 12 songs are great. definitley worth checking out. the best tracks are 1,2,10,17. it is worthy of being labeled as a hip-hop album. which is hard to come by these days."
4,"Bad cover, good content.","Who picks the covers for these things? This contains episodes 22-24, 22 being the season finale of Fist of the North Star, where Kenshiro finally fights Shin, and you have a picture of a no-name punk flapping his tongue around at Ken on the cover.. But anyway, episode 22 is one of the most dramatic episodes of any TV series I've ever seen. But make sure you buy this subtitled. The dubbed version totally destroys the drama, and they even completely remove the vocalized song ""Yuria.. Towa Ni"" that plays during one of the most powerful moments of the series, replacing it with some synthesizer garbage. Buy the subtitled version!"
5,stirring!,"I have only recently begun to love Brahms and these recordings make me question why it's taken so long! The music is incredibly rich and colorful, especially the C minor, Werther's Ballad, which you can just feel Brahms pain at losing his friend Robert Schumann! The Beaux Arts Trio is a sure winner! You will enjoy this!"
3,good library addition,"anybody who doesn't like brahms is a terrorist with a heart of IEDs!at the price point ($7/cd when i bought it), this is a great deal. the performers are not my favorite, but i have to admit that it is an excellent value and a good recording overall. i look forward to enjoying it as i roll in an inflatable pool full of all the pennies i've saved...."
3,item not as pictured !,"Amazon is showing the wrong product photo for this item, and I bought one. Of course I did not get what I saw here.. the photo is of the Klein 1604-20L where the ""L"" stands for the little pivoting latch to keep the cable from falling out of the jaws. I'm quite disappointed, but since I need it, I'm thinking of keeping this one.. it's less expensive anyway, so I'll have to pay an upcharge to get the locking gripper shown as this item. Please guys, put up the correct photo. Sure it'd be nice if you'd make me a special deal on the locking gripper that's in your photo, as an exchange. Let me know if so."
5,a great helping hand,"Klein Tools have always been top-shelf, IMHO. I have to move my floating dock several times a year to compensate for changing water levels and the 1604-20 Haven's Grip makes slacking the cables easy. Without it my winches used to ""Bird-nest"" like a spincast reel."
5,Great for some uses,"Purchased these as hiking bionoculars, so would not have to carry my heavier ones. Works great for using short periods of time to identify a bird.Pros:- Very small light weight, even though case is mainly metal- Nice case to comfortably attach to belt- Focus quickly and wellCons:- Could not use with glasses, even after following manual instructionsUnbelievable value at under $14."
3,Good Binocs,"Not fantastic binocs, but very adequate and light to carry with you to Safari in Africa. I was not disappointed with their performance and always was happy when seeing traveling companions fighting with their heavier, bulkier and more expensive binocs."
4,Gift,"This was a gift for my Grandma. She is going on vacation and wanted to take binculars for sight seeing. These are perfect for travel, they are small and light weight, and work very well."
3,Not the best,"I ordered 3 binoculars Bushnell Powerview 8x21, Tasco Essentials 10x25 and Barska Blueline 3x25 opera glass. After comparing them during day and night. I decided to keep Tasco and return the other two. I think the 25 view glass make a difference for the light to get in the right way comparing with the 21. Both the Tasco and Barska are very clear without light interference. Barska is very cute and elegant. It is great for ladies who also like some fashion when going to opera. But the 3x limited its power. I wanted something that can see the bowing of violinist when go to concert and sit in the back row. Neither the Bushnell nor the Barska fold all the way. They create bridges. So they are not super compact. Barska comes with a cheap pouch looks like leather but not. Both Bushnell and Tasco come with nice fabric cases which can be attached to belt."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I received this product. I had bought tickets to see Wicked to surprise my husband for his birthday and thought having a small pair of binoculars along would make the experience that much better, so I purchased them to surprise him. Wow, they worked perfectly for viewing the show and as a bonus I was able to fit them in my smaller purse for easy carrying. I liked them so much I bought another pair for my mom for her upcoming cruise to Alaska. Great product for the money, a true bargain!"
5,Fits in your Pocket,"These busnell 8x21 model binoculars have been my sidekick at mutilple theatre experiences over the last 15 years. I picked them initially to fit in my pocket as I ushered at a large multi theatre complex in my city. They needed to fit in a blazer pocket so that I could do my assigned job , slide into a theatre seat and be ready to watch the performance. The ability to see the performers in close up detail from the last row, or the upper balcony, or even standing by the back wall caused me to rejoice in my choice. The magnification produced by these compact binoculars did the perfect job. I have reveled in the quality , magnification and compact size of these binoculars. Other ushers have admired them and I am ordering two more Busnell 8x21 model for friends who use the theatre. Good job Bushnell!"
5,Surprising compact size!,"These binoculars truly are the type you can throw in your backpack or purse and take with you! They fold in half and fit into a small carrying case that comes with them (approx 4"" tall, 3"" wide and 2"" deep). I was pretty surprised with the small size when I opened the box! Without any adjustment, the binoculars offered a crisp image of birds, trees and other features around my neighborhood - I can't wait to take them on my next hike or to a football game. These are a great buy for the money and would be a perfect gift for nature lovers (hikers, bikers, birders), sports fans, or children just discovering the outdoors."
4,nice item,"The product is nice and compact size. Feels like a quality item. Nice carrying case with belt loop along with a neck string. Bought them for my husband to use, he wears glasses and can see great with these."
4,Good for tjhe price.,"I bought these to take hunting and they are light, easy to carry and take up little room. The image is clear and for the money they have a decent field of view. I like them for what I have them for."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This item had pretty mixed up reviews when I was buying them. Some people loved it at 5 stars, others hated it saying they couldnt see anything out of them at 1 star. Undortunately, I joined those who couldn't see anything. Believe me you when I say I've used A LOT of binoculars so I'm now a newb to this. I bought them specifically for one purpose, shooting range and identifying where the bullet hits on target at 100 yards - yeah good luck. By the time I dialed in and finally was able to barely see the target, though still looking very very smudgy, my husband unloaded 2 AR15 mags. Wouldnt even pass this as a toy binocular, my son's $2 chinese made plastic crap shows clearer image."
5,For the price,"It's a steal. They are a great pair of binoculars. Light weight and can be put on a belt, ready to grab when needed and not be cumbersome while on the belt."
3,Good form factor...but mine had issues,"The binoculars felt good and compact, just as advertised. However, mine had cloudy rings in the field of vision. I returned these and bought the Olympus 7X21 PC III Classic Binocular (from Amazon) which is also compact. Images in those are much better."
4,They Work,"At this price, very inexpensive, there is no need for a detailed long review of these binoculars. The main question at this price is ""do they work?"" and the answer is ""yes, they do."" At least mine do. For the price, we're satisfied customers."
2,they went crosseyed on me.,at first they worked well but after about a week or two I started seeing double images. Now they're on their way to the trash can.
3,"Great magnification, but difficult to look through","This product magnifies well, but it is smaller than it looks and there isn't a lot of space to put your eyes in. People with long eyelashes can also find it annoying when their eyelashes collide with the binocular."
4,Great binoculars for the price,We purchased these for our trip overseas. We wanted lightweight binoculars for our twins to use and they love them! They were very useful at the airport spotting all sorts of things and outside bird and wildlife too! They are very portable and for the price I cannot believe the quality!
4,"compact, and light",Bought these to carry in the field have only had them a couple days so am not sure yet how well they will work.
4,Cheap and effective,"I go to the opera often and sit at the family circle most of the time. these binoculars are small and very cheap, and afford a fantastic view of the details (the costumes, the facial expressions) I would otherwise miss. I wish I had purchased them sooner! I love them!"
5,Excellent binoculars and highly portable.,"When I bought them for this price, I thought they were going to be like kids' toy binoculars. However, when I took them out of their little box and felt them, they looked very professional and well-built. No kids' toy plastic, but professional look and feel (they smell like a well-built device. Yes, I smelled them, too.)I tried them in the open and I could see several blocks away with a clear image.These binoculars are a good deal for the price."
2,Fuzzy image,Definitely magnifies as per advertised but the image was too fuzzy to make out. I have better distance vision without the binoc. Had to send back.
3,"Lightweight and compact, but poor optics","This is a small lightweight binoculars. Can fold and put in a shirt pocket. The optics however are not that great. An 8x magnification for this size lens means you don't see clearly, and they could have used more stabilization, especially given how light it is. Picture keeps shaking, especially hard to focus as you have to turn a dial while looking at this vibrating image. Can't complain given the price, but I wanted something that is easy for a little child to use. I am not sure if this fits the bill."
4,Nice for the price,"I have owned these for a couple of months now, They are lightweight and come in a nice pouch that can attach to your belt. They are very easy to adjust for easy eyesight. I primarily use them for backyard bird watching. I look forward to using them in 2013 for some hiking, the nascar daytona 500 and NHRA gator nationals. My only complaint is the strap is thin and poorly placed but the price is right."
5,"Compact, sturdy, excellent value","I bought these to use at football games and on my informal birding walks. They are an outstanding value--compact and portable, easy to use, yet very sturdy and well-made. Much nicer than you would expect for the low price."
4,From the perspective of a beginner and amateur photographer,"I know very little about binoculars. I know a lot about cameras, but have never owned a pair of binocs. I wanted to buy a basic binoculars with a decent range for my photography nature trips. I wanted to survey a scene quickly with light binoculars and decided to get this one. It's cheap, had good reviews and a respectable name. Here are my views after owning it for a couple of months:PROS:1. Excellent value2. Respectable name3. Small and light4. Good solid quality5. Adjusting stereo vision is quick and smooth and stays in place once found6. Comes with a nice little soft case7. Folds up nicelyCONS:1. Eye holes are smaller than I would like. Still see my eyelashes sometimes. This is expected of most compact binoculars.2. Requires a decent amount of light to work. A little difficult for sunrise photography.3. Neck string is thin and difficult to replaceOverall, this seems like a very solid product and at this price, it's a no lose choice."
5,Excellent Value and Quality,"I recently purchased these binoculars and I also own another pair that I bought at a much higher price. I have to say, these are better than my $50 binocs! Great stability combines with wide viewing area and easy focus to create the best binoculars I've ever used! This is an easy purchase, a must buy!"
2,You get what you pay for -- especially true with binoculars.,"ON the positive: these are great as compacts that fit inside your car's glove box or in your pocket. On the downside: the optical quality and stability is poor. But then, for the price, you get what you pay for, especially with binoculars.A note if you do buy them. One of my rubber end-caps fell off somewhere in the woods. These rubber end-caps are just slip-ons, so you will need to put a drop of rubber cement on them to be secure.Overall: For the price and easy of storing they are great: 5 stars, but, for the optical performance - 1.5 stars. There are better binoculars for a little more mula. Conditionally Recommended"
3,Okay...for the money,"Pros: Compact, light, easy to carry, great priceCons: Loose eye piece easily slips out of focus, forcing user to adjust focus in two different places on the binoculars every time they view a subject."
4,"Good view, very small package","These things were even smaller than I thought they would be, which is nice. The case takes up very little room. Good clear view, easy to focus, I think they're great for the price."
1,Useless and a waste of money,"Do not waste your money on these, I thought they would be light and handy--wrong!! The eye piece is so narrow a child could not use them. Do NOT buy these compact and silly binoculars."
3,"A ""Tiny"" Bit Disappointed","It actually does a decent job of magnifying for it's small size. I just didn't realize it was only going to be 3"" x 4"". I really was hoping for a typical, larger set of binoculars that don't feel like a toy."
1,It doesn't work,"I don't know what's wrong with the item i ordered. i read the reviews before i bought it. when i got it, it didn't work at all. even the book in front of me, it looked smaller and further if I used it. For further distance, I saw more clearly just with my glass. Is this really a telescope?"
3,Buen producto,"Un buen producto, da lo que vale, no mas, no te va a sorprender, pero tampoco decepciona."
2,Not for me,I could not use them at all due to a former detached retina repair. I gave them to a friend.I'm sure they are probably a good buy. I should have been alerted to the fact that if you need bi-focleglasses they would be a bad choice.
3,"Good product, Fair company","I bought this specifically from OpticSale because they said it would be here before Christmas. It didn't come till Jan 6th! I called 4 TIMES!!! I was put on hold, hung up on and followed a recording that said to leave my name, number and I was never called back (twice!) Worse online transaction ever! NOTE: OpticSale wanted to make things right and contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience, they refunded the shipping and refunded an additional 15% of the items sale price."
4,Great item for child birder,This actually surprised me on the quality of the binocs for my 3 year old grandson. He loves birds and has had a great time using this. Perfect choice for the occasion. Good value!
4,Handy glasses,"I was surprise when I received these Bushnell glasses in the mail because the box was so small! These folding glasses pack a punch, though. Small, yet they zoom large and bring things into focus just like the larger, heavier binoculars they are replacing. Best of all, they fold small enough to keep in your jacket pocket and they also come with a carrying case. For around $15 how could you go wrong?"
4,My Review,I was looking for a pair of binoculars just to be able to look at the birds and animals closer. I decided on this repair because of the price and good reviews. It's a good pair for the money and works well for what I got them for.
5,Very helpful.,"Ordered these binoculars for myself and a friend to take when we went to see Cats. Although our seats turned out to be fairly close to the stage, we were happy to have the binoculars to see the fantastic makeup jobs. We had thought about opera glasses but were very happy with our choice."
4,Great value,"These handy binoculars are perfect for what I ordered them for: some casual bird-watching. They come in a tidy case, and are easy to operate. Because they're small, they are a bit difficult to adjust, but overall, a great value for the price. They do exactly what they're supposed to do."
5,"For the price, can't be beat","I am not a binocular aficionado, but needed something for general hiking and hunting activities. I would guess that there are others out there that offer a clearer and brighter picture, but these are great for my needs, especially for $13!"
4,Worked Great for our trip to Yelowstone,"I bought 2 pairs for my kids for our trip to Yellowstone National Park. These Binoculars were great for that purpose. I needed them to be small, inexpensive, and offer decent magnification and image quality. They were great for getting a closer view of distant wildlife. They held up to rough treatment for our week long vacation and are still in great shape."
1,Poor build quality,"Maybe I just got a dud? The middle piece of plastic on the underside broke off after the first time I tried folding the binoculars back up. The rubber end on one didn't turn and when I finally did get it to turn, the rubber cap fell off and the washer underneath it fell off with it.I've never seen such shoddy workmanship. I didn't expect much from a pair of $13 binoculars, but I expected it to at least not fall apart!I'm still trying to figure out the adjustments in order to get a clear view, but why bother if I have to hold all the pieces together for me to use it!"
4,Decent value,"For about $20.00, these are just fine. The image is not particularly bright...but they are clear and focus accurately. And they are VERY portable - folded they are about the size of a GPS or digital camera."
5,Can't be Beat for the Price!,Nice clear optics and quick/even adjusting. Lightweight and GREAT for birding. LOVE them! ONLY issue is they are MADE IN CHINA I would have bought one for each of my family members (10+)IF they were American made.
3,Adequate for theater use,"Purchased 2 of these for a trip to the Kennedy Center, for the price they are a decent opera glass.Small, easily portable and could be stored in a pocket. Good magnification and field of view, but some distortion when viewed through my eyeglasses.My daughter was using the other pair and did not report any distortion (contact lens wearer).These are *not* the binoculars you want for long-distance or highly-detailed views (e.g., birding), but they are useful for indoor venues. Low cost is a plus in the event they are misplaced or damaged."
4,"Great for Vacations and Trips...Fall Colors, Sports Games.","Used these Bushnell Binoculars on two vacations this summer and fall. Even with kids handling them, they have held up well so far. Magnification is good and they are compact enough. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the eye cups are relatively small and takes time to get used to."
3,Great for kids,These are low priced and are equatable to what I expected. These were bought for my children to use during camping outings. If you are looking for a good set of binoculars for adults you would be well advised to spend more money for a better pair. They are rather small but are functional for carrying in a pocket etc.
2,Older version is much better,"I liked these binoculars so much I purchased a second pair. Unfortunatley the updated version is not nearly as nice as the pair I received about 5 years ago. The older version is shown in the 3rd image - I notified Amazon so they may remove it by the time you read this.The old version:- has a nice rubber coating- focuses much better, easier to use focusing wheel- folds down smaller- easier to hold with fingers (round vs. larger flat top section)My old version is also much clearer, but I have a feeling I may just have a bad copy. It's a little blurry even after focusing. The old pair is crystal clear.I'm very disappointed in this new version. I'm looking for the old version online but there's a chance sellers are using the old photo and selling the new version."
5,I can see,Can't believe the quality for the price and fast delivery. These babies stay in my p ack so I can us them when I want.Way to go Amazon.
3,Light and Small,"These are light and small and good for the price. However, we found them a little difficult to focus. It took quite some time to adjust."
2,Yep ... they're binoculars..,You get what you pay for ... they are cheap. Lo quality glass and don't focus very well. I was unable to use them for my intended purpose but I asked too much of them (low light situation). Handed them off to my kid.
4,Best value for money,"I bought my first binoculars. These are compact, lightweight and easy to use. Highly recommend."
4,Bushnell Powerview Compact Binoculars,Bushnell Powerview Compact BinocularsIt works great! They accomplish exactly what I bought them for. I would recommend them to anyone the wants to see something in the distance that is not too far away.
2,Bushnell Powerview 8x21 Compact Binocular,I ordered two of these to keep in the car. One of them had to be returned as it was out of alignment and resulted in vertical double vision. Not very good quality control. The one that worked was fine but I gave them two stars to call attention to the bad one and warn customers to check them carefully on arrival.
3,Nice for the price!,Better than the one we used to have and we can see clear when we see our favorite Broadway shows.
5,Big viewing in a little Binocular,This little binocular offers much more than advertised. The ease of use plus the compact size makes it a pleasure to use and opperate....I HIGHLY recommend.
4,Good compact binocs,"For the price, these are great. They hardly take up any room at all, and the magnification is plenty for most applications. They're not going to give you super viewing for astronomy since the objective lenses are pretty small for the magnification, but in daylight they work just fine.I bought a pair for each of my daughters (6 and 8) since we have regular campouts together, and they haven't managed to break them yet -- though there's still time for that :)Two small cons: the case, while collapsible and convenient, is a bit tight (especially for kids to use) and the strap is really just a cord so it's not terribly comfortable. Of course the glasses are pretty light, so it doesn't cut into your neck or anything. All in all, good quality for a good price."
4,Replacement for a Previous one,"I bought this binocular through Amazon.com to replace a Bushnell I had for a number of years and enjoyed using at concerts. An inner prism[?] broke when I dropped it. If this new one serves as well, it will be another excellent purchase, especially for the price!"
2,Disapointment,"You get what you pay forThis unit is very difficult to use, and is not worth the moneyI recommend this unitBushnell Falcon 10x50 Wide Angle Binoculars (Black)Easier to use, and better vision through lenses"
3,fine for price,"For the price, these binoculars are a fair purchase. Nice and compact as well, with a carrying case."
1,Shakes too much,"I find it hard to use these binoculars. I have to sit down, lean against the wall, and rest my hands on something in an attempt to stabilize it, and even then I'm not successful -- it keeps shaking too much. I'm buying a pair of 6x binoculars. Maybe this shaking problem isn't Bushnell's fault, but I still think a one-star is appropriate since I find these almost useless.Edit: A previous version of my review said that it's not wide enough for me to use both eyes at once. That was wrong. Sorry for that."
1,1 star,like the comic. Dint like the movie I was very mad when i paid this much for it and it stunk. Dumb graphics go out and read the comics and enjoy.
5,Knorr Chicken Flavored Bouillon,"Every part of our experience, from ordering to receiving the product was a very good experience. I will definitely use this product and company again. Thank you for your quickness in responding to my order. Have already used the product and find it to be everything that it was advertised to be."
4,Amazing Astroboy,"While it was released in the 1960's, Astroboy contains thematic elements that seem more pertinant in today's ultra technological age. Astroboy's stories had dark aesthetic appeal that seemed more well suited to a mature audience than kids. Made with foreboding, ideologically implicit themes on artificial intelligence, discrimination, societal unrest and more, Astroboy is unbelievably powerful for animation."
4,The Wealthy Barber,This video is an outstanding way for average people to learn a common sence approach to money management. I got alot out of it. Believe it or not the video is entertaining. I high recommend this video to young people as they will benifit the most from watching this video.
2,sonar insider,"NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!!! TOTALLY NOT FOR BEGINNERS, WILL GO WAY OVER YOUR HEAD FROM THE GIT GO."
1,joker,"just like the name says, this fool is a jokethe worst cd i have bought since i purchasedstraight playing by shaqoutosoe"
5,The track Uh huh featuring Bizzy Bone,someone put up a website where i can get this track from i've been look for it for the longest.
5,Forget what Osoe says,"I remember the first moment I heard this enchanting sound. The crisp bass and the harmonic rhythm that just made me take off my orange LA hat and put the r kelly shades to rest.It was a total transformation from r&b; to straight outta cleveland sleeze. Bizzy Bone is my biggest idol. Eleo, your not a big fan, Im the truest Bone Fan ever. My Mo thugs tatoo across my belly can prove it.Any way, all respect is due to Bizzy bone. Stay up and I dont wanna see you in a deep dark alley....in the hoood hO** ya know.Joker your the best. Keep writing those rhymes.Peace Bloke"
2,I wanted to love this machine,"I bought this machine for my husband for Christmas, since we had been looking for something like this for a very long time. A week before Christmas, he brought home a different (I think Westbend) egg cooker and I had to tell him about his gift. We anxiously tried out the two in a poached egg cook-off. Henrietta is so adorable, we both wanted her to win, but the eggs came out underdone and the whites were runny. We tried it on two different days. If we hadn't had the other cooker (which works perfectly), we would have kept Henrietta and learned to live with her."
1,Cheap plastic junk,"Purchased this and used two times, the tray that holds the water is warped, the top doesn't fit tight, the eggs don't get cooked, half raw, difficult to clean and hard to get the eggs out of poaching tray."
2,Henrietta needs Help,"OK Henrietta was given to me as a gift. And she was cooking hard boiled eggs but every single time, no matter how carefully I measure the water, she over-flows and the eggs crack and over-flow their shells. Egg water all over the counter top and egg white bubbled out of the egg. After a few weeks of use, the egg piercer has dulled, making it difficult to pierce the eggs with out cracking them.Now she's under-cooking the hard boiled eggs (I must admit I never tried soft boiled).So it's a cute little machine and it kinda works but not worth the money- get a real egg cooker and chalk this up to novelty item."
2,bad eggs,"please DO NOT try to poach eggs with Henrietta...they do not cook all the way (runny whites) and when i attempted to give it another run thru the eggs were WAY overcooked...it is great for hard boiling eggs, but other than that it is useless...would much rather poach them the old fashioned way!"
3,Cuter than it performs...,"It worked like a charm the first few times. But be careful, if you put too much water in, even just a tad too much, it will overflow and the eggs will become undercooked.It's very hot and you could burn your skin if you reach over the steam hole. I learned the hard way. :-(When used correctly, the eggs turn out great! Perfectly cooked!The nonstick part does start to smell a little burned after use. The chirping is more like a beeping.I don't have any other egg cookers to compare it to, but this works great for fast, no-fail (when used properly) hard boiled eggs for my family! I like the puncture pin it includes to help the eggs from not getting the green or black ring around the yolk. I would recommend it with reservations."
5,luv it.,I have had this product for about 7-8 years. I have found that if you add water to the correct level it doesn't leak. I have also discovered that different sized eggs cook differently. You should experiment with times and different sizes of eggs. I love it.
1,disappointed,I was so excited to get this....finally I could make proper eggd but it either overcooks or undercooks everytime. I still haven't had a good egg out of it yet.
4,Convenient way to soft boil eggs,"First encountered this little cooking gadget down east in New Brunswick, and finally found one in a tiny hardware store in Nova Scotia. Have owned it for years, very convenient and reliable. You do have to experiment with the amount of water you add to cook your eggs to the way you like them, but once you get that right they will be perfect everytime. Recently I served one to a friend and she immediately wanted to know where she could get one, so I purchased one on line from Amazon. Have heard no complaints. I like the fact that the chirping does not stop once the eggs are ready until you unplug the unit. And the eggs stay warm for quite awhile."
2,HENRIETTA HEN EGG COOKER,Henrietta laid an egg. She could not cook my extra large eggs. Poor Henrietta is just to thin. The top half of Henrietta is not a good fit either. I think Henrietta's water broke because I found it on my counter top.
1,The Worst,"Absolutely the worst egg cooker I have ever owned-am looking to replace ir with ANYTHING. It undercooks eggs, leaks & doesnt turn off unless unplugged. I had a metal Oster cooker for 20 years- Read the review from the person who bought it for 50 cents & loves it-I can't say it's even worth that. A BIG waste of money"
1,Henrietta boils over! :(,"Hennrietta is cute, however, the cooker is too shallow and the water boils out over the sides. I eventually learned how much water to put back in and repeat the cooking, to get cooked eggs. Her ""chirp"" eventually reduced to an inaudible buzz and one day, blue electical arches danced from across her ""body"" into the puddle of water on the plate under her. Reluctantly, I had to throw her away."
3,HENRI-ET-TA,"Henri-et-ta! Henri-et-ta!I just bought an egg cooker named Henri-et-ta!And suddenly that dameClucks like she's drowning in the rainActually this egg cooker is pretty cool. She can hard cook, soft cook, medium cook and poach your eggs for you. My only complaint is that when she is done. She is supposed to cluck. This cute feature is the reason why we adopted her. Instead of a cute little ""hen cluck"" we get the ""shower scene theme"" from ""Psycho"" that would make Janet Leigh flinch. So unless you are expecting Norman Bates for breakfast, you might want to buy an egg cooker that takes up less room."
1,Teflon Coating will peel off after a few months,"This cooker was very cute so I bought for my daughter.The only problem is that the teflon finish starts flaking off after a couple months of use - very dangerous for ones health, especially a child"
3,Egg Cooker Lays an Egg,"I thought it was really cute, but wasn't jazzed about it's all plastic construction. I found that it requires careful measuring to get eggs cooked soft."
1,Terrible...,"I've tried to hard boil eggs with this cooker at least seven times, and they've always ended up terribly undercooked. And water always seeps out of the edges, even if I put less water in. I never write reviews anymore, but this product was so terrible that I felt the need to express it..."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this to make poached eggs. Have yet to have them come out the way I want them. A mess to clean,stem to pull the tray out very loose,takes too long, doing them the old fashioned way far superior."
2,Upsetting Idea.,Am I the only one who finds the concept of a mother hen cooking her eggs to be a bit macabre?
3,Henrietta Hen Egg Cooker,"Cute addition to my counter top BUT...takes some ""playing with"" to get poached or soft boiled eggs cooked correctly. Instructions are too ""iffy""...for example: if eggs are cold, cook longer; if eggs are large, cook longer...it's a crap shoot UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO HARD BOIL. Still haven't gotten an egg to ""poach"" to my satisfaction but I'm working on it..."
5,PERFECT EGGS! THE KIDS LOVE IT!!,"I love how easy this is - although a reviewer is right about short on features - that is what works so well for me. Plugging it in means I didn't forget the on/off switch. All of the hard boiled eggs are done in a jiffy, but you also get smiles from the youngsters as they wait to hear her chirp. Initially I thought it was an alarm going off, because I was in the other room - but it was just Henrietta with her chirpy reminder.Thank you Egg Cooker people, and thank you- Amazon! Amy Nymark"
1,Don't waste your money,"This does not poach eggs at all. If you do it according to their instructions, your eggs are raw and clear. If you add more water, the yolks turn solid and you can't even remove the egg. The poacher is impossible to clean. I bought a sos pad just for it. You can't even fit a large egg in a poaching compartment, it spills over. When I hard boil, some eggs burst at the top. I've had it 6 mo and it has turned rusty on the bottom and the water that forms on the top of my poached eggs turned a reddish color."
3,i loved this item but not good quality,"I LOVED this product. I cant even tell you. Always perfectly cooked hardboiled eggs that I don't have to worry about. Its been about 1 year since I purchased this and I went to get it out of the box and saw that for some reason, the non-stick coating had started chipping off. What a bummer. I guess I will have to get a new one. I liked how small this one was and I thought it was funny."
1,Tossed In The Trash,"Didn't work worth a darn, eggs overcooked, undercooked, and the sound never worked at all. Cheap JUNK. Don't waste your time and money."
4,It is fun and useful,"The eggs come out quite tasty and in a fraction of the time as boiling the eggs. The thing I don't love is that sometimes the water leaks out around the edge, but I guess it just boils over?"
2,chicken,"I bought this as a gift to myself. After only 4 uses, the teflon coating...that only has water on it began corroding and flaking. I did like the plastic egg holder was easy to remove the eggs from, loved the style. But really, 4 uses and no trauma to it and it starts flaking?"
5,eggscellent!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this silly little hen does exactly what it says it will do, how refreshing to receive a good product. it works well, as described......thank you"
2,Overrated.,The top item of the three parts warps easily and even though I never washed it in a dishwasher it got warped after the 5th or 6th usage. Has no off and on switch. Some of the red and yellow plastic (chicken) decorations fall out as they did on my item before I used it 10 times. I got mad enough that I threw it in the trash and did not even try to sell it for parts on Ebay.
3,I don't really get the love for Hush,Okay the art in this book is fantastic but Hush isn't a good mystery its painfully obvious who Hush is and the thing is that we never heard of Bruce Wayne's childhood friend until this story and his motives are unclear. We hear that he wanted to kill his parents but we never get a reason why he hated his parents and wanted there money was he just born evil or something? The good news is that if you don't know anything about Batman or any of the supporting characters its a good book to pick up. This volume is also better then volume 1 in terms of length. I enjoyed hush but it wasn't anything mind blowing.
5,JUST PLAIN ENTERTAINING,"This book doesnt set out to reinvent batman. All it sets out to do is strait up entertain you with a non-stop action thriller. Mission accomplished. Jeph Loeb is my favorite author. I highly suggest that you pick up long halloween and dark victory, written by him as well. The art in this just blew me away and was just as good as Loeb's fantastic writing. Be warned the ending does get pretty confusing but it is nothing a second read through can't fix. If you want a defining epic Batman tale I suggest that you pick up long halloween. If you want a mid-career batman tale that is just plain fun, Hush is for you."
2,Nowhere Near as Good as Part I,"Unfortunately, this second volume of ""Batman: Hush"" falls victim to the same problems that usually plague the second halves of graphic novel series. In other words, the storyline is predictable and the action outweighed by tedious amounts of exposition, as though the author is trying to unravel the previous volume's mysteries as fast as possible rather than allowing the story to unfold more naturally. The artwork is still very solid, but I would have greatly preferred to sacrifice some of the mystery of Volume I (which is excellent!) if it would have meant keeping Batman from long expository ponderings while he's supposedly fighting for his life!Reading this second volume, I was reminded again and again of the second volume of ""Superman: For Tomorrow"", which suffers almost all the same problems. Overall, I'd say both series are still worth reading, but in both cases, the first half is definitely better!"
3,"hush 1 was pretty good, hush 2 not as good as 1...","first off, this should have been collected in one volume. i can understand that they wanted to get it out in stores so they split it up, plus they can charge a couple of extra bucks...but it's been out for a while now so it should be in one volume.the story is pretty good, not incredibly great, i think loeb maybe went off on too many tangents trying to involve every single great batman villain or ally somehow into the story (plus the 'twist' ending is pretty obvious). but it's certainly not bad and worth reading. jim lee's art is great."
5,My son loves this book,My 17-year old son is a Batman fanatic and really likes the illustrations in this book. He said he'd highly recommend it to any Batman fan.
5,"Lee arts and great story, nuff said",Jim Lee Batman and Superman arts are the main reason I bought this comic (and the first issue). Lee fans won't regret it and the story itself is great. I prefer the 1st issue story though.
1,What a mess,"I am trying to return this damaged lift kit that was nothing to what the description said, everything was loose and unpackaged and was also chipped and what not. And then I return it and two days later UPS comes back and deliver it to me. I can't even contact the seller because there's no email so I will leave them a review. I just want to return it and get my funds back"
3,A Tragic Man Despite Himself,"First of all, it's in one volume as I received it, but everything is in there, so just a quibble with the ""2 volume"" desciption. The book itself, because it has all of Chekhov's short plays in one place, is indispensible for anyone interested in the Chekhov oeuvre. The translations are . . . Well, to paraphrase another translator, Jan Tuwim: in translating, one can translate the skin - or the heart. ""Heart"" translations may be guilty of inaccuracy. These translations are very accurate, but only skin-deep."
2,Not too satisfied,"This was the first time I've had any issues with buying textbooks through Amazon. There wasn't any communication with this vender, the charge came out of my account two different times (one was replaced) and it took me about 3 weeks to get my book (I've never had it take more than 5 days). I wouldn't recommend."
2,It feels like an after thought...but I'm still glad to buy it.,"Firstly, let me say I'm happy to support guerilla & indie films. Congrats on getting something out, that's further than most people get.I didn't like this short but I didn't hate it. It is HEAVY in dialog from the bearded guy and overacts a bit; very small town theater. The concept is interesting and I'd watch a more developed version (the imdb plot sounds pretty good)."
1,Buyer beware,"This is NOT a collection of songs,just one long track of remix so you cannot select individual songs, certainly NOT worth the price.vol. 1 and 3 are individual tracks for each song,but not this one,for some reason.So, you are warned..."
3,"cute, but overpriced","This four piece ""music band"" is fun for the little ones, but I don't understand how it is worth $40. If it was $15 or $20, I would give it a 5-star-rating."
1,Worth about $11,"When I ordered this item, it had a different picture on the product page. It was made to appear much more interesting than what it is.I had sent as a gift to a friend. When I called Amazon, they said that the only option was to return the item.I cannot imagine asking someone who you sent a gift - to make a run to the post office in order to return it.Beware buying toys from Amazon!!"
4,An excellent Mahler collection,"This is a very good set, good to be in every collection. It's undoubtable that the crown of the collection is the ""Song"". Baker is in the Ferrier league and Haitink draws some amazing playing from the Concertgebouw Orchestra. James King is very good also and as a matter of fact I prefer his singing over that of Julius Patzak in the Walter/Ferrier/VPO account for Decca. The sound is also much better than the mono of Decca though the new remastering has worked miracles there.I would place this performance up there with the Ferrier account. The other pieces in the collection are first class too, but there are so many great performances out there.... Hermann Prey is excellent in the Kindertotenlieder but can't match Ferrier's account for EMI. As for the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen nothing can match the combination Furtwangler/Fischer-Dieskau on Orfeo."
1,Disappointing product and shipping method,"I bought this product based on the reviews here and on some other sites. I read it would be a little hard to mix, but I thought I would give it a go.Unfortunately it's IMPOSSIBLE to mix! I have tried to mix it with all different kinds of juice, waters, even smoothies that I made at home. Even after shaking, stirring, and blending for 5 minutes, I still get stuck with large balls of unmixed goo that are horrible to taste and swallow.Save your money - there are other natural and healthy vitamin powders available that are easily mixed. My local Costco and GNC both sell brands that I would go back to.In addition to the mixture, I received the container poorly packaged in a box 3x its size. The container was punctured with a 1 inch long tear, and a large portion of the powder had distributed throughout the box it was shipped in. If I would have liked the product at all, I would have been disappointed that I lost so much of it in shipping"
2,Multi Vitamin Powder Review,"It does not mix well with juice or anything else. It does not not mix, it stay at the top of what ever, liquid, cereal, yogart. The taste not palatable either. I'll let you know if the benefit out ways the taste and consistancy & let's not forget price."
1,Why is it so gritty?,I was taking a liquid vitamin but read that the preservative they use mixed with ascorbic acid creates benzene which is toxic to humans so I decided to try this powder and just mix with juice to make my own liquid vitamin. Well I can't even get it down. It tastes awful even with juice and its so gritty that I feel like I'm drinking sand! Back to the drawing board I go.... :-(
1,"Don't buy if you don't like that ""vitamin"" smell!","This made me throw up. It had that strong vitamin smell, and even mixing it with juice didn't help. Fortunately, the company offers refunds, so I was just out the shipping costs. I now use a liquid vitamin and have no problems drinking it."
5,Music of strong emotional and intellectual content,"Aaron Jay Kernis writes strong music. By that I mean that his works are written with a firm sense of form and a sure grasp of harmony and color. I dislike using the word accessible, since that evokes the idea of dumbing down, pandering to the lowest common denominator. Kernis's music is accessible in a far more profound sense; it rewards the listener willing to pay attention with a complete musical experience. There are beautiful sounds, but there is also real emotional power, and perhaps above all, the music makes sense. It has harmonic interest and a sense of direction. This composer has been a real find for me."
1,Disappointing,"I found focusing these binoculars difficult, to almost impossible. Once in focus, they would not stay in focus. The adjustment focus for individual eyes also would not stay focused properly and would jump out of focus for no identifiable reason. The clarity of the image was far worse than I have come to expect from Bushnell products. I returned them for a refund."
4,lightweight and small,"These binoculars are great. They will fit in your shirt pocket and not even weigh it down. They are really clear too. I love to take them to sports events. And I keep them in my pocket, so I don't drop or beak them! I would recomend them strongly."
2,You get what you pay for,"Difficult to focus even when brand new. Jostle it too much and you'll have to start squinting even more when you use them. In all honesty, however, I didn't expect much from a $17 pair of binoculars."
3,Don't expect the world,"If you're looking for a pair that you don't want to lose sleep over losing or having your kid break, these are it.Having 20/15 vision, I find it's not easy keeping focus, because I have to change both the focus and the diopter on one of the lenses to bring an image into clear focus."
4,Great for the price,"I got this binocular for [...] with free shipping from [...]. At such a low price this binocular is really great. It is light weight and easy to carry. The image quality beats many of the ""toy"" binoculars you can find for the similar price.However you really have to keep in mind that it IS a cheap compact binocular. Its lenses are small, which means the image will be relatively dark, which means it won't be very usable when not in a bright environment. The roof-prism design also limits it image quality (but still much better than the no prism Galilean binoculars). These are the compromise you have to make in change of small size and low price.The focus ring is the only part I don't feel fully as expected about this binocular. It is small and tight, very hard to turn. When you or your target is moving it is very hard to keep your target in focus.-1 star for it."
4,NICE SIZE FOR LADIES,"These are just the right size for ladies, specially for distance viewing. My husband cant get on with them because with the small eyepieces he cant rest them against his brow to steady them - they float- and go out of focus. For us with smaller eyesockets they sit very nicely and the lenses are very clear. The clarity and detail being just as good as my bigger much more expensive pair. Very light and handy you can just keep them in your pocket ."
2,gave it to my 3 year old as a toy,The eye piece holes are too small for adult eyes. I gave it to my 3 year old son as a toy. The clarity wasn't all that great either. Would not recommend buying. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Don't Buy It,This is a cheap binocular and it does not work. The one that I bought does not focus and I am returning it.
1,Returned twice--both defective in alignment,"I'm sure these binoculars are good in many ways, especially for the price, but mine were defective immediately out of the box--twice. I purchased a pair and found myself unable to correctly focus the image (yes, I followed all the directions). My image was doubled, and I looked up alignment problems and tested it by focusing on a horizontal wire and then slowly separating the lenses; the line was disconnected, indicating that the binoculars were not aligned. This is not something one can fix, and Bushnell's warranty requires paying shipping. I returned them to Amazon for a replacement, and found the replacement had the same issue, albeit not to as great of an extreme. Nonetheless 2 minutes of looking out of these would give anyone a headache."
3,Not so great,I got a pair and for a while they were ok but then they got hard to see out of for some reason.
2,Not such a good counterfeit,"You may think this is the real apple earphones but they are not.Real bad quality no bass, high treble, plus very VERY uncomfortable in your ears.Only buy them for tricking your stupid friends that you got a pair of black apple earphones.2/5"
5,Normal?,"Working as an NP with both men and women who ask me 5 days a week if their 'petals' (I love that word) or the petals of their partners are normal I open up this book and give them time to look thru it..The vast majority of the time I have had pleased and grateful reviewers. The most common remark is 'not only is mine normal but perhaps.... even beautiful!I love the reminder that what is sometimes taken for granted, is indeed something to be cherished. Beautiful work!!"
3,Okay,Thought I might use this as a reference for figure drawing. There definitely differences in the subject matter. Fine details like these are not needed in my drawings.
2,Expensive for what you get,"I like the fact that this is a sturdy enough travel french press, but it's overpriced for what you get, especially for amazon pricing. I'd give the product itself 3.5 stars since it is pretty good quality but it contained no directions, and I'd bought it for a family member who was new to french press coffee. I was expecting something a little nicer and fancier for $30+ dollars."
3,"Love the function, but not so durable","This is the first french press I've ever used and the coffee is great. It's pretty easy to clean and the design is great. However, the stainless steel around the base has cracked and the paint started chipping after minimal use and hand washing with only a cloth. I like how it works but it could be built a little better."
4,French press mug,I bought this for work so I didn't have to make so many trips to the kitchen making Teeccinos. I am disappointed that I lose so much coffee at the bottom. I had hoped it would press the grounds and leave all the rest of the liquid to drink. It definitely keeps your beverage HOT for hours. The boot cut shape makes it very stable.
3,It's no Bodum,"For all the hype about quality, this product fails miserably. I've used a Bodum thermal stainless coffee press for years and have bought them for gifts too. This year a good friend of mine expressed a desire for the French Press Mug by Planetary Design; so I bought her one as a gift...what a mistake! While the body of the press is fine, the plunger assembly was a huge disappointment; both in design and construction. The plunger assembly is cheaply made, is hard to fit into the press barrel and frequently slips out of position. Another feature I do not like is the rubber not slip ring at the bottom of the press. If you slide the mug at all while setting it down, it grabs the counter top and tries to tip over.I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone. I DO RECOMMEND buying a Bodum Stainless product instead."
2,french press,"Wasn't too excited when I received this. It seemed to be in other than new condition! When I contaacted the seller, I felt the response was not too professional and more rude than anything. I kept the mug just because I did not want to deal with packaging and sending it back. Can't win them all!"
5,Best press I've used,"So, I bought this a little over a year ago and I LOVE IT!Works perfectly and keeps the coffee hot. Mine has held up very well and I use it all day everyday!Easy to clean, travels great (take it to work) and the filter is till in great condition.I highly recommend this to everyone."
3,Not sure,"I just finished this book. The story of a woman who spins music for a living and lives on other people`s couches.THIS BOOK IS WEIRD. The whole premise of a woman sleeping on a different couch every night was strange. I also wasn't crazy about the subject matter (spinning music).Although the story was well written, I have to admit that after finishing this book, I realized that I did not like any of the characters.The author was good about joining Samantha, PJ and Leslie together - when at first glance it appears they have nothing in common. However, none of these characters were remotely likeable.PJ who is kind of the main character is not particularly fun and she really gets on your nerves after a while - she relies on absolutely EVERYONE else to do everything for her. Not a pleasant characteristic in a main heroine.I did not hate this book, I just found it very weird and not that much fun to read."
5,"Amazing, can't get enough!","I read this book while I used to work in this office during the slow hours, which happened a lot... and I read this is 2 DAYS! I loved it, and I loved it so much, I read it twice, and passed it on to someone else. I greatly appreciated everything the story had to offer, and I still can not find another one like it. I suggest if you like the music business, to read this book."
4,Yardley just gets better,"This book was so much fun. Since reading LA Woman, I knew Cathy Yardley had potential as a chick lit author. Couch World is much more gritty and realistic than most chick lit offerings. PJ is a flawed and very likeable character, and I really cared about what happened to her. I got drawn into the whole DJ scene, and Yardley's research really shows, but without it looking like she was just spewing out facts. And I also like that PJ's best friend is a bouncer named Sticky instead of a ""ditzy best friend"" stereotype.All and all, it's a great read. A few typos present, but that's Red Dress Ink for you."
4,"Somewhat outdated now, but still has great information.","I used this book for many school papers and while it is somewhat old, the specifics it gives in stealth airframe materials are outstanding. I highly reccommend it also for its history of steath programs starting with WWII"
5,Stealth Technology,"Awesome book, give the full out history in laments terms to the history and implementation of stealth technology - or the so called ""art of black magic"" get a hold of one today"
2,anything to displease Dad= boring,"I have to admit, I wasn't able to get beyond page 20 in this book. I guess I'm just too old (mature, grown-up, adult) for the idea of ""anything to displease Dad"" as a viable life plan."
1,So bad,"I am typically a huge fan of Red Dress Ink books. Had to force myself to finish this one. I suggest ""The Solomon Sisters Wise Up"", ""Milkrun"" and ""Confessions of an Ex-Girlfriend"". Those were all better!"
4,The Oxford-Duden Pictorial French and English Dictionary (Paperback),Very good book with a very wide vocabulary
1,Wine Away = yes; Wine B'Gone = stain be there,I had the opportunity to use Wine B'Gone - or should I say Wine B'There. Then I bought WINE AWAY and poof the stain was gone! Don't waste your money on any of the other stain removers for red wine - nothing works like Wine Away!
5,Excellence is Just the Word,"This is a no nonsense book that goes into the details of Active Directory Design. I used this as part of my preparation for Windows 2000 Active Directory Admin (70-217) exam. It's for the adventurous sysadmin who is prepared to script and tinker with the AD. Replication, Scripting and GPO's get my top marks. This book is like all O'reilly books, written for enthusiasts by enthusiasts - You'll like it or hate it with a passion !!"
2,"Two much theory, not enough examples","This book does a great job of covering the theory, but it doesn't do a very good job of explaining or giving examples of how to actually implement those ideas."
2,Based on Beta 3 ?,"this book gives good detail on Active Directory which is a large and potentially confusing subject matter. However, I found it really annoying that the book seemed to be based on Beta 3 - every 10 pages or so there are sentances like ""in the final release"" , ""Microsoft may change this feature in the final release"". This is especially important for Windows 2000 as there were some key changes in the Release CandidatesI bought my copy a good few months after 2000 was released - If a book is based on a beta version of a product it should say so in fairly large letters on the cover."
5,"Great detail, well-presented","I am biased because I also write computer books, including several for O'Reilly & Associates. That makes me even more sensitive to what makes a good book. In this case, it's the level of detail and of technical accuracy that really makes this book shine. Mr. Lowe-Norris clearly knows what he's talking about, and by the time you read the book you will too. The hidden gem is the book's Part III, which is dedicated to teaching you how to script AD using the ADSI interfaces. I frequently recommend this book to students in my classes on the strength of this part alone-- whenever someone asks for a good scripting book, this is my default recommendation. It's that good."
5,More of Vivaldi's great music.,"When it comes to Vivaldi's works, the majority of people usually tend to associate him solely with composing the Four Seasons. However, this particular cd will introduce classical music lovers to other music that he composed for various stringed instruments, including the violin and cello. It does include a section from Winter of the Four Seasons, but the rest is other music that some may not be too familiar with. For a low price, you'll be getting a great selection of music."
5,A Great Introduction to Postmodern Theology,"Unlike the reviewer above, I ""got it"". This is an excellent book on modern, or better yet, postmodern theology.It deals with the fundamentals of theology: Faith, Revelation, Scripture, Religious Symbolism and Theological Method.Haight brings out the faults of the older theological traditions and leads us in the way in which present day theology must go if it is to be of any value."
3,religious,I purchased this book as a prelude to a class i am planning of takeing. It would be a good book for the layman but don't plan on becomming a Theologen after reading it.
5,Touching!,"Shelby is engaged, but when her fiance is killed and she discovers she's pregnant, she doesn't know what to do. Tucker, her fiance's brother, steps in and they marry. What starts out as a marriagefor all the wrong reasons, may end up being more...Coulter tells a touching story of love and redemption."
5,joint relief,I am allergic to shellfish and this has none and I am basically pain free now Its great stuff
3,"brilliant, for young teenagers","The book Buffalo Brenda is an excellent book for young teenagers. They can relate to it on how to fit into to a certain group at school. Their is a good lesson in this book. People need to express their feelings, but not hurt others and they need to be themselves and not try to ""fit in."""
3,"for younger kids, and plain","I think the book was good. The book would relate better with younger teenagers, because it deals with young teenage problems. Kids will learn from this book that you need to be your own person and not do things just to fit in, and be cool."
1,Deeply Disappointing,"It was a good thing that I was not expecting much from this book, or I WOULD have been deeply disappointed. A thin plot, unlovable characters, and cheapo dialogue were thinly veiled by weak attempts at humor and sheer absurdness. So absurd, that it was hard to relate to the book and just added to the many flaws in the story. In some cases, weird characters/story/settings make a book more enjoyable, but this book was an exception. It just didn't work out."
3,"Good Content, Poor Translation","sThe odd translation makes getting to the content in this book more difficult than it should be. I found myself reading and rereading passages trying to make sense of them. Sentence structure is clumsy at best and there are so many asides that I often forgot what the original subject was. That said, there is some genuine wisdom to be found here. You'll just need to do more than read the words laid out in front of you."
3,never really gets to the heart of the matter.,"As someone interested in japanese history and culture, rather than in learning martial arts. From previous comments and the authors pedigree, I figured that this book provide me more illumination on the historical ninja. Unfortunately, by the end of the book I still didn't feel that I had a very good grasp of who the ninja were and where they fit into japanese society. One problem with the book is that Masaaki Hasumi's writing tends to jump around quite a bit (perhaps better translationa and editing would have helped).On the bright side, there are quite a few hidden pearls of wisdom hidden within the text, that I found interesting and useful."
5,For any serious ninjutsu practitioner . . .,"This book is excellent for a number of reasons--the main one being that it was written by the world's leading authority on ninjutsu, Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi. As usual, it dispels and debunks some of the popular myths of the ""ninja""; but it also contains some of the Grandmaster's techniques and some interesting Japanese history. Full of neat tricks and tidbits (like how to put a frog to sleep), this book is a ""must have"" for the serious ninjutsu practitioner. In my opinion, all of Hatsumi's books should be considered required literature for the true Budo warrior."
3,Rather light even for this genre.,"A light-hearted read, this plot borders on the silly, even for this genre! However, it is not an unpleasant read, though I found the secondary character of Anna far more interesting. Supposedly unattractive and supporting the main character, Anna deserves her own book because she is obliterated by the ""over the top"" slightly silly antics of the two main characters.I would like to read a book featuring Anna, because she deserves one for putting up with Stevie. I shall go onto the author's website and see if she has written one and if not, suggest it!"
3,Eclipsed,"For me the point here is the K.563, and while I have loved Grumiaux's playing for decades, and this is a nice older [1967] recording, it is completely blown away by the recent recording by Yo Yo Ma, Gidon Kremer, and Kim Kashkashian. On the other hand, the latter recording is defective in that the technicians managed to make the violin sound shrill and harsh -- the usual suspects are of course recording engineers who've spent much of their careers blowing out their high-end hearing listening to and working with ""rock and roll"" recordings, and thus needing to boost the highs in order to hear them; at the same time, it was miked much too closely. At least the Philips recordings were done in an era when the engineers were older folks who had spent their careers listening to and recording music. My choice: the Ma / Kremer / Kashkashian CD, but with my treble control cranked down...."
5,Gift,This was a birthday gift and she really liked the album. May buy another one at Christmas time. Very nice.
2,Unreadable,"There may some great information to be found within this biography, but I have no idea what it might be. I'm sorry, but after half a dozen tries, I found this book to be organized in a haphazard fashion and so badly written as to be unreadable, and I simply abandoned the book as a lost cause. Clemenceau is a hugely interesting historical figure & clearly the author has a great admiriation for him, but the inpenetrable writing style obscures this entirely. If you are a student and have no other source materials available for your Clemenceau report, you have my sympathies. I would recommend this book only to the most masochistic of readers."
2,Not much here,"There is no real advice on this tape. A few shots of exercises, but nothing to say which ones you should do for what problem. The tape says to consult your doctor in conjunction with using the tape. Total run time is 22 minutes. Quality of video is like a home movie."
5,fantastic visuals of the applied forces to cranial technique,"This Atlas of Cranial techniques goes a long way to visually orient the practitioner to specific techniques applied to the cranium. Each layout is a detailed description of the applied technique, while the visual application is beautifully rendered on the opposing side. This is a must for anyone interested in expanding their approach to the patient with cranial techniques."
1,westgull,"I am an esthetician and bought this book for information on new massage techniques for the face and scalp. UGH!! What this book shows are techniques for bone plate realignment of the skull. It is full of medical terms with no reference. Way, way, too technical."
1,Worst Screen Protector Ever,"I have bought a lot of screen protectors, and they can be hard to install well, but these are the worst. Impossible to install well and start peeling up at the edges almost immediately. Also, I bought a 3-pak and one of the three was missing altogether from the package."
4,Encouraging Words for a Woman After God's Own Heart,"Elizabeth George wrote another great inspirational book for women. I love the short stories, and enjoy the art work of Judy Buswell. A great gift to purchase for a friend, mother, sister, or daughter!"
3,"Great animation, poor story","It's hard to tell where in the Robotech story this is supposed to fall exactly. By the date, it should be about the time of the Invid invasion, but somehow it feel like it is a sequal to the original Macross Saga and is ignoring the Robotech Masters and the Second Generation stories.The animation is very pretty, fast, smooth, and lifelike, but the story is unfocused and the characters uninteresting to me. There are also some issues I have with the premise. Both these characters should be grounded and in front of a court-marshall board and someone should look at this fighter test program and realize that the competition should be between the fighters, not between the pilots. I don't know if I'll bother with part 2 at this time."
2,dated,I used to think this was the most incredible thing ever. Now I realize that: 1. This series is retarded / 2. It's nothing but a Top Gun rip-off / 3. Anime is for teenagers / 4. Anime only seemed cool and futuristic in the early 90's / 5. The only good Anime is still AKIRA / 6. This DVD has some of the most sub-par video quality I've ever seen for this format.
5,The Review - Part 1,"To start, I think anime is a very underatted. Not enough goes to promote it beyond Pokemon and Dragonball. Any way, i digress.Macross Plus would have to be one of the best produced anime EVER! Visually, Sound, and Story wise, it is very appealling. DVD doesn't offer too much extra, but it does let you compare dialogue between English and Japanese.The First volume starts it off by introducing the three central characters, Test pilots Isamu and Guld, and Music Producer Myung. All of them linked by a past event that shattered their friendship, and the story brings them all back together to confront each other.The drama in this series is done great, as well as the mecha battle sequences and the music. G-R-E-A-T"
4,Anime at it's best,"I must say that this is a great anime movie to own. I first saw Macross II on the Action Channel and found the movie quite boring and dull, but one day I happened to have found Macross Plus on and started to watch it getting hooked very easily into the plot. The music itself was beautiful enough to tag me to watch more. The japanese version is even better than the English that I saw on tv, it is a great anime with beautiful animation. I loved this movie and I've seen many"
5,Anime does not get any better than this!,"If you were stuck on a stranded island and had to choose one anime title to watch, this would be it (along with volume 2, of course). The story is great, the music out of this world (with a big selection including fast paced and also slow peaceful music), and don't even get me started about the animation itself. All these elements make this movie a must own. The only thing that could possibly make this movie any better would have to be more mecha action scenes. Don't get me wrong, what battles they do have are visually stunning, and the sound effects just kick ass."
4,A Better Sequel,"Let me say it right out: Macross Plus is thousands of times better than Macross II.There. Now, as for the show, it is a surprisingly well done work in the theatre of anime. The plot seems cliched at first, and it does take a little while to reach the first twist, but it does manage to pull together. The story does shift around a bit to the untrained eye, but if you pay attention, you can grasp the concepts in play. The rivalry between the two test pilots is revealed to be deeper rooted than is first apparent. Part 2 reveals information that will turn the relationships upside down.This is a skilled work, put together masterfully, and worthy of your money."
3,Minor Keys Make Melancholy,"While there is no disputing that the selections on this disc are top notch recordings, the fact that they are all--every one, unless I'm mistaken--in minor keys is to its great detriment. There is in the minor keys an underlying anxiety, which would seem to be counterproductive to the cd's theme of ""bedtime"", unless your name happens to be Bram Stoker or Edgar Allen Poe. Go instead with ""Beethoven At Bedtime"" if you're in search of an aesthetically excellent sleep aid."
3,Minor Keys Make Melancholy,"While there is no disputing that the selections on this disc are top notch recordings, the fact that they are for the most part in minor keys is to its great detriment. There is in the minor keys an underlying anxiety, which would seem to be counterproductive to the cd's theme of ""bedtime"", unless your name happens to be Bram Stoker or Edgar Allen Poe. In fact, even the tracks in major keys are a bit edgy on this disc. Go instead with ""Beethoven At Bedtime"" if you're in search of an aesthetically excellent sleep aid."
1,"Roll the dice, this one is a gamble",I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply.
5,Superb Interpretations,"I have known this recording for a long time, and it has lost none of its initial appeal. Throughout there is playing which is notable for its poise and effortless beauty. Even though I enjoy and often prefer original instrument performances, the Grumiaux/Jaccottet rendition of these sonatas is my favorite. This reissue on CD is a true bargain."
3,Not Baroque style,"I was disappointed to hear this CD when I received it, having acted on the highly complimentary reviews I'd read and the competitive pricing. However, the violinist does not use a Baroque style violin and the performance is not in the Baroque style. For example, a good deal of tremolo is used. I note that the original copyright dates are 1979 and 1981.I suppose the quality of the performance is good, but I'm now so used to hearing Baroque style performances of these sorts of pieces on original style instruments that I can't get past the lack of these things.I confess to having only listened to the first work. However, nothing indicates that the others would be any different."
4,"I admire Carkeet's writing, but . . .",". . . the ending, while certainly ""unpredictable and downbeat"" (as one of the other reviewers notes), was not, in my view, ""fitting""; rather, it seemed abrupt and arbitrary, drastically changing the tone of the novel sustained up until the final few pages, to no particular purpose. Having very much enjoyed Double Negative and The Full Catastrophe, I was angered and depressed. Nevertheless, Carkeet remains one of those rare writers (like David Lodge and Michael Malone) who not only makes me smile a lot, but also, at times, makes me laugh out loud; and, mostly, this novel did the same for me. So I still recommend it. Perhaps those for whom this is the first Carkeet novel will not have the same issues I have with the ending."
4,The final (?) volume of a trilogy,"This book, featuring the adventures of the linguist Jeremy Cook, finds him in a situation similar to that of the previous novel, ""The Full Catastrophe,"" (1990). His is, unofficially, this time, studying the language development of a child, and helping to stabilize the family's domestic situation. It is not necessary to have read the previous two books (""Double Negative,"" a mystery, was the first), but as I mentioned in my review of ""Catastrophe,"" it is always enjoyable to know something of the background of the central character, and as was the case with ""Catastrophe,"" threads of the story line are carried from each of the preceding novels. This book ends badly for Jeremy and the reader can only hope that Carkeet will someday produce a ""Reichenbach Falls"" plot twist so that the series may be continued."
4,Another good read by David Carkeet featuring the linguist Jeremy Cook,"Not quite as fun a read as The Full Catastrophe or Double Negative, still, the Error of our Ways entertains."
3,Nice book but the same content as Calligraphic Ornaments CD-ROM and Book (Dover),"A decent collection of ornaments (a bit repetetive, but very useful and well drawn), but you would be better off skipping this edition and getting ""Calligraphic Ornaments CD-ROM and Book (Dover)"" instead. It has the same contect (exactly the same) plus a CD."
4,Present for younger sister,"I heard a track from this album on Pandora a few days ago and immediately clicked over to see who it was and was very pleased to see the band name. My sister has a boyfriend that everyone in my family strongly dislikes and his name happens to be Brad! Once I found this album, it rounded out her 19th birthday present. Great music and a perfect name to boot!"
5,A summit of self-deprecating pop/rock,"Beck's ""Loser"" and the Offspring's ""Self esteem"" are among my favorite songs, so it's probably no surprise that I love Brad Sucks... and this album is particularly good. I first got hooked by ""Making Me Nervous"" (the main hit, I guess - incredibly catchy), but it's a really good album all around, and the lyrics are quite hilarious: ""it seems you've mistaken me for someone who cares / I'm just a dirt bag under the weather and overrated"", ""time to take out the trash, you know it's easy / but it seems harder every time you try to think about it""..."
3,Beck wants his sound back,"Brad doesn't suck. He's a decent musician, but from this record it's quite clear he worships at the altar of Beck. Brad needs to develop his own sound."
1,Coincides with College Conspiracy by NIA,"Yea, the book simply isn't worth anything close to what they are asking. Each year they make one or two very minor revisions and sell the latest to unsuspecting college students for over a hundred dollars!! The true value/worth can be seen by the previous years edition which can be purchased used for ONE DOLLAR, hence the real worth.Don't get screwed, buy the previous year, save a truckload and get 99% of the needed educational material.Greed has got to stop, this is rediculous. If you have not watched College Conspiracy produced by NIA or the National Inflation Association I would higly recommend it.A (10th Edition) by butt. Yea, lets make some money by screwing the college kids, they won't know any better. What pigs.Regards,Scott"
2,Spectacular but disappointing,"A very visually rewarding production, but...I'm sorry, Gruffud is not Hornblower and the TV version of the story is not Forester. Ioan Griffud is way too handsome and too apt to show his emotions to be the Hornblower we know from the stories. As for the TV production, it has been padded out to an hour and forty minutes by the addition of numberless commercial-TV/Hollywood cliches. I also found it tiresome to be belabored about the head and shoulders with endless conversations and confrontations presented for the sole purpose of conveying the idea that aristocracy is evil and egalitarian democracy is good. That was not Forester's point at all, I think, which was, if I recall correctly, a bit chauvinistic (i.e., British discipline over French slovenliness, with the revolutionaries and artistocrats equally reprehensible and chaotic). Perhaps I'm being too critical. but I had hoped for more."
5,Moisturizing Antibacterial Soap,"I bought this product, mostly for my breakouts. I was hesitant to buying it as this soap is not as popular as Cetaphil or some other brands. I found that the scent is very pleasant, it does leave my skin well moisturized and it prevents any break-outs and fights the existing ones, now I'm using it daily. Yes Dial Soap is an old brand, but it truly works. I know that I'm going to buy this item again, very good quality product."
2,strangefolk loses its way,"For anyone who knew Strangefolk back in the 1990's: approach this record (and this incarnation of the band) with caution.Reid Genauer is gone, replaced with a new singer/guitarist who sounds like a classic-rock karaoke singer and brays like an injured mountain goat. The magic of the original Strangefolk lineup came from Reid's thoughtful songwriting and soulful singing, Jon Trafton's inventive guitar, and the band's tight grooves. Now Reid is gone. Trafton doesn't show much of the fire that he once had. On the plus side, the band can still kick a groove and Luke Smith remains the best drummer in the genre. But without a compelling story to tell or even a heartfelt emotion to convey, this new Strangefolk has become just another neo-hippie jam band on the fraternity circuit.Bottom line: If you were into the band for the grooves then this record will probably suit you. If you were into them for the songs, you'll have better luck with Reid Genauer's post-Strangefolk solo work."
4,Background bad guy,"One of the later figures in Kenner's 12"" Star Wars figure line, the Imperial Officer is one of the better looking and more poseable figures in the collection.Pros - The articulation of these figures took a big step forward with this wave. This figure can be posed in far more ways than the previous 12"" figures, and doesn't have that bulky G.I.Joe body. Of course, that means he's a bit flimsier as a result. The outfit is fantastically detailed, and comes with a removable cap and pistol. The head sculpt is impressive as well.Cons -The joints - particularly in the legs - could have been tighter. This figure is prone to collapsing under its own weight.It could have been better, but this Imperial Officer figure is still a worthy addition to the 12"" Star Wars figure collection."
4,Martini..... continued,Mágnifico album recopilatorios con los mejores temas del momento. Es casi tan bueno como un Matini en una piscina rodeado de rubias.;-)
2,not big enough for a large dog.,"Our 11 yr old Great dane is unable to do steps into and out of the house without help. The ramp is a bit narrow and even with me holding her, she frequently places her feet to the left or right of the ramp and needs to be held to keep from falling."
2,Great Stationary,"This product is great if it will be stationary but I found it difficult to set up everytime I put my shepard into our suv. He goes with us everywhere. I found the ramp to be bulky and heavy. With twins in the car as well, there is not much room to bring the ramp with us - wherever we go."
4,"Used as ""boarding ramp.""","I am pleased with the petstep, though I don't think I'd trust it to the advertized 500 pound rating. Nonetheless, we use the ramp as a boarding ramp aboard our sailboat. It works nicely for this purpose. I did think the ramp came with a center locking device, however, such was not the case."
4,"Helpful, but somewhat heavy","The PetStep ramp has a good angle and traction surface for our dog. It's sturdy enough for our 70 pound dog, but I find it slightly heavy and a bit awkward to fold and unfold. Allow for the storage space in your car when not in use."
3,Large dog ramp,"The ramp is as advertised and somewhat too short for a Hummer H2; it works, it is simply a steep incline - this the only product I have found that is suitable for my 85 lb. Weimaraner. Using it on the side door is risky as the opening doesn't allow it to be firmly positioned."
4,Useful addition,"The ramp has good traction, which is important for my old dog. He doesn't see well and needs to feel secure using a ramp. A different brand of ramp had a sand paper like surface, which gave the old dog no traction.The Pet Step ramp is a bit heavier than i would like, and takes up a fair bit of space in my van, but overall is a useful addition to my dog equipment."
4,reliable ramp,"Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV. It is a great ramp, easy to use, very sturdy, a cinch to unfold and very lightweight. The tread is very good and provides for sure footing. We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight. It is plastic, so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it. I am really happy with it."
5,Sturdy and stabile,This ramp has good traction and can be set up easily on more than one kind of vehicle or object.
2,Useful but a hazard to the user,"It looked like a great Idea, just what I needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep. Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design. There is a finger ""crush area"" near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it. I have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time I used it. If I can't make it safe with a saw, then out it goes. It's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use."
3,Not as sturdy as expected,"When I read of the 500 lb weight tolerance, I was expecting a sturdier ramp. No way is this going to hold 500 lbs. I am a petite 127 lb woman and the ramp flexed and twisted as I tried to walk up the ramp spanning one deep step. This ramp is definitely not for human use. I don't think I'd trust it for a table with the leg kit. It would probably be fine for most dog purposes."
1,piece of junk!!,"I bought this same item from C*****. I set it up on the tailgat of my stock FORD F250 and found the angle steep. When I walked up it, I slipped! It broke in half at the hinge under my 150 lbs. of weight! I wouldn't trust it for my sisters' 200 lb. St. Bernards! I'll build one out of wood that is stronger for a lot less!"
4,Sturdy Ramp but Difficult and Ackward to Fold,Good sturdy ramp supports a lot of weight and gives great traction to the animal but it is difficult and ackward to fold up and takes up a lot of room in the car. I would love this product if it came in a telescoping version.
2,"Nice idea, BUT...","I bought mine 4 yrs ago, so I may have the previous incarnation. The handle broke off almost immediately, which made the ramp extremely unwieldy for a short plump middle-aged woman to work with. Then the cotter pin got lost. My English mastiff did like using it at first; now however, at 12 yrs old, he can't see the edges of the ramp & stumbles over the sides unless I guide each footstep. It needs to be wider for giant breeds; he's on the small side for a mastiff -- 160 lbs & 27"" tall. So be aware of what the design drawbacks may be. I now can use only one half of the ramp & that's really too steep an angle for my boy getting in & out of my Honda Odyssey. And I'm sorry, but 19 lbs is NOT LIGHTWEIGHT!! Not when you're hauling it in & out of a van!"
4,Great Product shipping problems,The Pet Step II is a great product. Rests on car bumper w/o causing any damage. Light enough to lift. You must be careful folding can cause pinched fingers. All my dogs adapted quickly.I had to place 3 orders to get undamaged item. Box doesn't hold up to shipping. 2 items had been dropped on a corner and broken
4,Works well but watch your fingers,"It's a bit heavier than necessary, I think. And be careful of your fingers when folding it - it's easy to get pinched or worse. Dog goes up it great."
5,Great product.,I didn't think changing out the shocks would make any difference. After the swap I can tell the difference and the shocks are fantastic. Noticeable better ride quality over the factory set on my Colorado.
1,Non- adjustable,I was holding my baby down around my waist. It felt like I had no control; she was just in a sack. She didn't look very comfortable and it was hard to manipulate her position.
4,Classic Hits!!!,Sonora Dinamita can get any spanish party started since they are known through out Latin America. A may MUST HAVE for your collection!
5,Latimore,"For some crazy reason,Latimore stuff is hard to find in the UK.I recently had to replace many of my cd's after my car got stolen.This particular cd,was unobtainable in the UK(at least to me),but,once again these guys came through.If you need any rare tracks,these are your first port of call."
1,Gulda Plays Beethoven and Mozart,"Horrible. An embarrassing performance of Beethoven's 5th, painful to watch and listen to. I disagree with the other reviewers who thought it to be 'heartfelt'. It seemed instead to be wasteful, careless, uninspired and an insult to the audience. I can't find much to recommend about this, although I do enjoy Gulda's playing of Mozart, which is captured well in the ""Mozart Tapes"" released on CD by DG."
5,An awesome timeless film,"I first saw this as a student years ago - and its still a timeless and horrifying reminder of how the remnants of the English aristocracy happily sent to slaughter thousands of English young men in the name of glory and ""playing the game"". Centres round a new recruit to the Royal Flying Corps in France during WW1, and his naiive idolisation of his flight commander who was his School Captain, is a 'jolly good chap' and is seeing the lads sister.The brutal aerial photography coupled with a sensitive sub plot makes this a great film - well worth watching but not for the squeamish!"
3,"Designed for Aesthetics, not for real use!","Installed in newly renovated kitchen less than two years ago. Sprayer hose has 'hardened' and cracked. It's slowly been leaking - engineering design fills & pressurizes hose ANYTIME the water is turned on - no kitchen sink until hose is replaced!!!. Delta's warranty ONLY covers the faucet & 'finish'. No big deal - take hose off and bring to local hardware store. They look at me like I'm from Mars! You can't buy the hose or the Delta SPECIALTY connector - called a ""Quick Snap"" connector. You have to replace the ENTIRE sprayer for well over $80.00It's very pretty and looks great! Very substantial, but don't use the sprayer too much or you'll have to shell out almost a third of the faucet price just to fix the sprayer!"
2,No Cheers for the Cheerleader,"This book was annoying to read. Without chapters, it was a rambling narrative. The murders that occur in the beginning of the book are immediately tossed aside so that an apparent sub-plot can be introduced that may or may not have any relevance. The basic storyline is OK, but a lot of the situations are so preposterous as to be laughable. If this is the author's normal style of writing, forget it. This will be the last book of hers I'll read."
3,Just A Book,This book was entertaining but not much else. Nothing really special about it. Basically just a run of the mill suspense/mystery. The story was good but I felt that the ending was rushed. A person would be better off borrowing this from the library or a friend.
5,Enchanting,"This CD is wonderful. I saw the musical twice while I was in France, and couldn't get enough of it. The music is soothing, yet brings out all the intense joy and emotion of the book. Daniel LaVoie and Jeff do amazing jobs with the songs, and each song is a new discovery. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone, even if they don't speak French."
3,Package was open,The package was damaged and open but the line looks fine. Gave three stars because I expect the item to be in brand new condition. Came on time and have not reeled my spool with it yet. I'm assuming the line is still fine.
2,Not for me.,I'm an occasional angler. I typically use 15 to 17 lbs mono on my baitcaster but figured I'd give this a try. Meh. I seemed to have constant problems with backlash or more likely twist. I couldn't stop loops from forming on reel. This and the additional cost are the only two negative issues I found but I couldn't find any positives. Back to mono and happy for trying.
1,Terrible stuff,This is the worst line I have ever used-- Stripped it off after 1 day and replaced with Trilene. Dont buy this stuff-- Way not worth the money. Two others had bought this junk and stripped it off as well
1,official book of kakuro book 1,It is too difficult to play on the kindle. it was purchased for my husband's kindle and after going back and forth from the screen to the page he finally just deleted it. if there is some way to play that is different it would be nice to have complete instructions--not on the game itself but how to use the kindle with it.
4,Great book for those who solve Kakuro using Logic,"I hate Kakuro books where you are suppose to guess ""wildly"" and cannot be solved through pure logic. This is NOT one of those.So puzzles might seem less challenging to people who like to use ""trial and error"" but, for the rest of us, it has plenty of challenging situations that can be solved logically.It does include some puzzles with more than one answer. So I can't give it 5 stars. But, on the other hand, I haven't found one that doesn't."
1,Simple puzzles,"This is the easiest book of kakuro I have ever done. I can even do most of the hard puzzles by eye-balling, which I can usually only do in easy puzzles. While I do enjoy the ego stroking, this book does not present much challenge."
5,Money well spent,"I was just about to buy myself a second island when I stumbled upon this little gem and just couldn't resist. I bought two - one for me and one for my wife - and let me tell you, it has changed our lives. No more living a second rate life for us. Now when we go out in public with our colorful Jet Service Vehicle, people treat us with respect. Just the other day, I was waiting in line like a sucker at the movie theater when I remembered I had my Jet Service Vehicle in my sachel. I promptly pulled it out and began playing with it on the floor and the crowd of patrons parted like the Red Sea allowing me to move straight to the front of the line. I highly recommend purchasing one of these if you want your quality of life to improve."
3,Just Okay,"We own many Playmobil toys and I've yet to find one that's substandard. That said, it's definitely not an inexpensive product, so I need to carefully consider every piece I purchase. The Grocery Delivery Van is a high quality piece, and a nice addition to our collection, BUT as far as vehicles go, we got more bang for our buck with the rescue vehicles."
5,macross plus is the best,"When I saw volume 1 Iwas amzed by all the arial action. Then I decided to buy volume 2. The final battle was amazing. Although I was dispointed when I saw the japnese version and found out that they cut out scene in the American version. The scene would have great with the American version, but still the American versoin still kicked butt. Macross Plus will always be my favorite."
5,The best film before Tiantic even took our hearts away,"This is truly one of the best animes of its time. Macross Plus has it all in a movie. It will make you see the reality that some people live in and try to hide from. The love triangle within this film is one of the best to date. The characters are unforgetable as they are in any other great film. Just like ""Tiantic"", you will be swept away. For those of you who do not like animes, this is a must for anyone."
5,OLD SCHOOL! 1st CLASS!,"All time master shines once again! Dave is a sort of ""new-old"" discovery to me. I have a few old Dave cd`s from GRP era (I am a sucker for that old GRP sound), but never took the time to listen to new stuff! But, when I heard samples from this cd, not only that I bought it, I also bought ""World on a String""! This cd is so natural, so rich, so vivid...it doesn`t sound like it was released a few months ago! Anyway, buy it if you love the old fusion-jazz-latin sound! You will be very pleased!You rule, Dave!!! :O)"
5,Great Jazz Flute,I have enjoyed listening to this cd over and over. It makes you feel good. His musical ablility really comes through.
1,Useless even if you don't care about quality,"The other reviewers who commented on the field of view are quite right. At this price you don't expect optical quality, but this binoc gives an image so teeny that quality is irrelevant. It's like looking down a pair of soda-straws. It's my impression that they were actually designed to have a wide field of view, but are manufactured with a ring-shaped baffle inside that cuts out most of the visual field. (Admittedly I didn't smack 'em open with a hammer to check. Just tossed 'em in the trash.)The folks at Bushnell suggested I send them in for inspection and ""possible"" replacement, but it wasn't worth the shipping..."
5,I just had to bring the rating of this product up!,"Because the person from Olympia, WA gave this product one star, the rating of this CD is less than it should be. Rebelion is one of the best salsa songs to date. Even in 3003, salsa clubs will still be playing this song. Also don't be fooled by versions, Raulin Rosendo also sang this song. Sometimes this song is also called ""No Se Pegue La Negra"".I still like Joe Arroyo's work more when he was with Grupo Niche."
4,"Joe, siempre grande!","As in my 32 Cañonazos review:Joe Arroyo is one of the greatest, yet unknown, tropical musicians of all times. His unique style, joeson, is a very interesting mixture of caribbean, african and latin rhythms, all in one. Great for dancing, listening or hanging out!!! This particular selection has his older hits, early 80's - early 90's. I'm not sure if it's available on Amazon, but if possible, get your hands on 32 Grandes Exitos (5 stars!!!)"
2,Not a traditional Zawinul jazz fusion album,"A composer/musician of Joe Zawinul's significance has certainly earned the right to delve into symphonic orchestral composition. But this music was disappointing. Being a huge fan of Weather Report and almost all of Zawinul's fusion projects, I hate to give this a poor review. I wanted so much for this to be the crowning acheivement in Zawinul's career, as another reviewer described this album. But it wasn't. I would highly recommend the ""75"" album instead, for anyone who's exploring Zawinul's post-Weather Report projects."
1,No Fun!,"I purchased this for my grandson and did not see it for several months after he received it. I did not like what I observed.When you hit the ball, it does not spin freely around the pole, allowing you to hit it again with ease. The ball is attached to a rope so that when you hit the ball, the expectation is that the ball will continue to spin around the pole until you hit it again.In reality, the top and bottom of the rope is attached to the pole with velcro strips which do not spin freely about the pole. The rope with attached ball just wraps around the pole. Eventually. the rope spins back in the opposite direction allowing the possibility to hit it again only to wrap around the pole in the opposite direction. This does not have enough momentum to hit the ball successfully.Would not recommend this item. No fun!"
4,Nice but a little short.....,I ordered this shirt in a large for my husband & he is not a hard to fit large. This large is a bit short. The seller did ship fast though.
1,Misleading Product Description,"I have not purchased this item, however, the product title and description do not match! The product claims to be an 18-inch stainless steel cooling rack, but the description clearly states that the item is chrome plated steel. These are two VERY different materials so buyer beware."
5,This is a GREAT pump at a very good price,"I have a split level pond, roughly 650 gallons on the lower level, 350 gallons on the upper level, covering an area of roughly 150 square feet. I purchased the Danner 02650 pump to replace my damaged Flotec model FP0S2300X 2300 GPH pump, as I could not find that same pump as a replacement.PROs:*Cost - $40-60 less than similar pumps I researched.*Fairly easy to install*Very long 20 ft electrical cord*The unit came with a back flow check valve and 1.5 inch fitting*Very quiet pump*Screen around the inflow area keeps out small objects*Output and suction was almost too much, so much water flowed through that initially pond debris clogged the filter on a daily basis.CONs:* None I could determine after 1 1/2 monthsTHE BOTTOM LINE:*Great price*Installation was a breeze*Accelerated filter cleanup is necessary depending on pond size"
3,Not enough head pressure,"This pump is great if you don't have to pump too high. I couldn't find the head pressure rating any place, but took a chance based on the reviews and purchased anyway. Mistake....At 7 foot of head it is well below 600gph. I ended up purchasing the little giant 4300 for $50 more to augment this pump. Wish I had bought it first."
2,Poor value. Suspect quality.,"This was my first knife purchase. Within a few weeks, the clip screws came loose, stripped out and the clip came off. Since then I have made several more knife purchases of varying price and quality. I have found that, compared to the Air Ranger:Similar knifes can be had for much cheaper, e.g. ""Smith & Wesson CK105H"".Better knifes can be had for the same price like the ""CRKT M16-13SFG"".However, the best value is an awesome knife like the ""Benchmade Mini Barrage Knife"".No matter which knife you buy, make sure the screws are tight, or they may come loose, like has happened on two of my knives."
3,not what I was hoping for,"It seems like a well made knife, it looks good and has a good feel, but I HATE the obtrusive clip on the back side (which none of the photos show). I need to get a tool which will fit the tiny star shaped screws to remove it. The blade is also tougher to open than I prefer, or would have expected."
3,Pretty let down. I should have known better.,"TOO LIGHT. Weak liner lock, no satisfaction in the hand, not sharp from the box, but it looks great online.. its truly worth more like $20-$25. Don't have High hopes, $40 could be better spent elsewhere. #Kershaw Vapor"
5,DEPENDABLE AND DURABLE,I purchased my gerber air ranger in late 2000. I then proceeded to carry it on active duty in the us army for the next 8 years. It still looks almost brand new. The only way to tell is the marks on the edge where i have had to resharpen it. About 6 years after i bought the knife i noticed i had lost a screw from the pocket clip. I contacted gerber got a brand new clip complete with extra screws. A small dollop of loctite and no problems since. The cold steel mini folder i purchased has been replaced twice since i bought my gerber. All things considered i believe this to be the best knife purchases i have ever made. I was thrilled to find it on amazon for less than half what i paid for mine and will now be buying a spare for myself and three more for my brothers and father.
1,Not genuine Oreck belts...buyer beware,Hubby put the new belt on our Oreck XL and it actually go so hot an stretched that it melted a hole in the side of the casing. Ended up putting the old belt back on to limp along until we go purchase new belts at the actual Oreck store in town. Basically these belts ruined our vacuum. The old belt worked and the new ones did not.
5,Great Price for a Great Product!!!,So pleased with this purchase. Genuine Oreck belts for nowhere near the Oreck price. Will definitely be back!!
3,Shipping Issue,"I ordered belts from GoVacuum Nov 7th. As of Nov 24th I had not received the belts and the company to refund my money. As of this writing the tracker shows my vacuum cleaner belts are in Minnesota, not Pennsylvania."
2,Nice to watch only ONCE,"It was nice to watch once, but i cannot imagine watching it again.The person talking had a monotone voice and he would say really weird things. A bunch of jibberish to be exact.This video is for people who like abstract poems and want to act artsy to their friends.It barely showed the band at all, so dont expect to see them much. Not really exciting video, unless youre expectations remain low and you have a glass of wine or two."
2,why this series isn't so good...,"First off, if you don't get the whole series of El Hazard The Alternative World (4 DVDs), that's because it's actually a sequel to El Hazard The Wanderers (which is about < 9 hrs in length) and that was a really good anime (I rate that at 4.5 stars) compaired to this sorry sequel. Second, After watching both El Hazard shows, I have come to the conclusion that you probably don't need to watch this series (Alternative World) at all...it's boring with a really weak plot...the anime just didn't do justice to the first El Hazard series...you can do without it... If you can manage it, try and find the series of El Hazard: The Wanderers instead...it shows how the gang first arrived in El Hazard from earth, it explains story behind the 3 priestesses, etc... and its a lot lot lot more funny than this one."

5,Fun Movie,Wedding Weekend is a fun movie about a group of college friends reuniting after 15 years. They are struggling with the passage of time and losing their youth.I thought David Harbour was wonderful and loved the scene where he struggles with losing his hair. He is a young actor to watch.
2,What a waste of time,"I watched to the end, but it was a waste of time. The acting was by the book but it lacked depth. Everyone had their part, but it was very formula-matic. I did not buy the 'suicide' sequence. Who did not see that coming from 25 minutes away?All of the actors did a good job. The script was very poor.The rental was only $.99, and I feel I overpaid.There are much better movies out there. Do not wast your time."
3,Average film,Do you like vanilla because that is what this movie is. It is a mild film that is trying to be the Big Chill but falls short. The cast is likeable enough but does not really grab you. The movie comes around at the end if you can wait that long. I just wish they would sing more as that is the best part of the movie.
5,An Independent surprise,"This is one of those little heard of independent movies that I found very enjoyable (I've watched it many times). It's an odd mix of friends (and some critics say actors)that deal with growing up, changing and moving on. I like it!"
4,Liked it better as it progressed,"I kept watching because I liked the music. The storyline seemed wimpy early on, but got better as it progressed so be sure and keep watching. You'll be glad you did by the end!"
3,It was ok but couldn't watch it again,I am a comedy-lover and this had a few funny things and I laughed out loud a few times but I couldn't sit through it again...just couldn't.
3,Kind of funny,"Kind of funny, weird how no one in the group could see something strange was going on with their buddy"
3,"Fine, but....",Brendel always plays beautifully....this recording is marred by miking that unfortunately captures Brendel's vocalizing and humming which is very irritating throughout -- unless you have been trained in the Glenn Gould school of selective listening!
2,"cold and restrained, too little emotion","These are the kind of recordings that turn people away from Mozart's wonderful piano sonatas. Try Uchida or Schiff for good interpretations. If you like Brendel, try his recording of the piano concertos where he does well. Besides the cool mechanical performances here, another complaint is that the CD leaves out Mozart's piano sonata KV 545 which is definitely one of his best and most recognizable pieces and the wonderful Fantasy in D Minor KV 397. Don't miss them! Any collection that leaves out those two and calls itself Mozart favorite works for piano is outright misleading, and any recording with so little heart and soul deserves only one star. I'll be generous and give two stars for the sense of architecture that Brendel has. Try Uchida or Schiff."
3,Rejoice,"Carl Tighe has produced 12 unusual stories following no particular sense of style or theme. He moves through the short stories with a jog like trot, you are occasionaly shaken and sometimes stirred, Some leave you with a sence of loss as they come to an abrupt end others like ""the colour of your money leave you with a sense of ""relief"",this could be aptly described as a literary contraceptive.If you happen to have been born in 1950 then you may discover 50 things about the year you were born or alternatively 50 things you didint know that you didnt want to know about the year you were born,depending of course on your point of view.It may not change your life but it has some thought provoking and interesting moments. Pack it in the suitcase this summer."
4,Low down and dirty!,"Back in the day, there were what was called race records and these records weren't censored the way that the ones that ""decent"" folks purchased were so a lot of dirty blues got recorded and released. This collection puts together a pretty extensive sampling of these ""Early American Party Records"". Wait'll the kids go to bed. It's a tradition."
5,"Go Ahead, you know you want to...","I was watching Sanford and Son on cable the other day, and was surprised to find that they had actually edited the episode that they were showing to remove what are now considered ""Politically Incorrect"" words or statements. The thought police run amok. If like me, you don't like the thought of someone trying to rewrite or erase a part of history, no matter how distasteful they may now consider it to be, then do yourself a favor and get these dvd's. I bought them separately and paid almost twenty five dollars more that this package deal costs, so it is indeed a bargain. I can't wait for the next season to be released. Get them before someone decides to edit these as well!!!"
2,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this toy for our 6 year old son . He absolutely loves it. He's smashed it so hard, so many times, yeah, the doors pop off once in a while, but they pop right back on. If it bothers you that much, I'm sure you could crazy glue them on for good . It only makes it more exciting for him.His little sister even loves it. This thing sure could take a beating. Definately been worth the money. Even better now at $30.00. I'm thinking about getting them the little one."
3,Very compact .,"Great binoculars for their size. Case supplied is a little cheap/poor fit. Overall, a good buy"
4,Pleased,The product does exactly what I brought it for I can sit in my living room a watch the birds out my window.Also it didn't break the bank purchasing the product.
3,Okay but not amazing,"I used these for a number of years without knowing what a good pair of binoculars is. I very much liked the small size, I could keep them on me at all times when I lived in the Columbia wetlands. But they don't let in enough light for bird watching. Sometimes I couldn't quite see the details to identify challenging birds such as hawks. After a while the hinge became loose and they gave double vision unless I held them just right with both hands. They were a little hard to focus in a hurry.So they aren't amazing binoculars but I'm glad I had them and very sad I lost them!If you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars then these might be alright for you."
4,A talent not to be missed....,"I have, ""Noel"" as well as the sampler for Steve's musical contributions and am very impressed. However, I'm disappointed there are no music samples at Amazon so everyone can determine, for themselves, that real talent is available. In particular, I would recommend,""Together We Can Heal"" and ""That Christmas Feeling."" But let's *hear* it! Or....you can take my word for it:)"
2,A Time Killer,"The worst killing regarding this book is the time it took to read it. As a previous reviewer wrote, this is a good ""airplane book."" No great shakes as literature, but then, it doesn't purport to be. The denouement was pretty obvious in this murder mystery and no grand clues were laid at the feet of the reader, but if you're just looking for a book that will help you kill some time, this will work."
5,Essential Words,"I bought this book for a Chinese friend who is studying for her GRE. This is the perfect book to help her learn words, how they are used in basic American English and give her some practice for the test itself. I also give it to any grandchild approaching the SATs."
1,might as well read the dictionary,"On the first five pages there are four words with the accent on the wrong syllable (according to Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition.) The placement of the accent might not be as important as the definition of a word but it is an error. Due to these errors I lost confidence in the accuracy of the book. I have purchased many things from Amazon and this is the first I felt obligated to write about."
2,Honky Honky,The horn doesn't work very well as it cuts out and works sporatically. I have another that works much better that I bought at a store and was able to try out before buying. Oh well it's just a horn.
5,Fun Bike Horn,"A fun horn for child's bike. If your biker rides on ahead of you on the bike trail, you can track him by the sound of this horn! Fun accessory for a child's bike."
1,"Looks good, works poorly","This looks good from a distance (although the metal is poorly made). It also sounds good. However, the way it attaches to the bike is badly designed, meaning that it keeps coming off."
3,fine for what it is,"It honks, which is what it's supposed to do. The horn is short and stubby, with the tubing making a loop, so it's kinda cute. Made of lightweight steel, the horn itself or the mounting bracket could get bent if you aren't careful. I bought it as a concert percussion accessory. I later found out that Walmart had an equivalent product for less."
5,The Damaja is Divine!!,"I really like this album. I listend to all of jeru's albums back to back and I think this one is just as dope. The beats are on point, the ryhmes are tight, and the delivery is crazy. all and all this is a hot album. My faorite tracks are logical,true skills, murda 1, da game, war, rap wars, queens and divine design. Try it you'll like it!"
4,Lyrically he does not disapoint,"However he should have some better beats they were somewhat lacking on the whole album,Lyrically however he kills all of the tracks and many of the good songs are because of his Lyrical abilities give Premo a call man and that will be tight.True Skillz-War-Praise the Lord-Dirty-Rap Wars-Devine DesignLyrics-10/10 Production-7/10 X Factor-8/10 Classic-8/10 Replay-8Total=8 out of 10 Fingers"
3,"So so, buy Divine Heroz 4 Hire instead.","The softest of all his albums I've heard thus far. Not bad, just boring and lacking the industrial loops of his other releases."
3,The Damaja steps it up,"Jeru comes correct on this one! A step up from Heroz 4 hire. The beats are more professional and infectious this time around, and he has also stepped up his flow a notch. Stand out tracks are, ""TRUE SKILLZ""(haunting but funky beat with ill lyrics),""MURDA 1""(bouncy westcoast sounding beat, a change for Jeru), ""PRAISE DA LORD""(unique beat with jazz flavor, also a change for Jeru, along with social commentary), ""DIRTY""(nice melodic, keyboard driven track with an infectious hook), ""RAP WARS""(super ill battle lyrics with speedy flow and the most danceable track Jeru has made thus far), and the title track, ""DIVINE DESIGN""(a nice track that would be great to dance to in a club with lyrics that attempt to bring some perspective to life, particularly in the so-called hood). Overall, an enjoyable release by one of the great artists."
3,Stay AWAY,"its hard for me to say this to the legend of funky sayings but i was disspointed with this one. too many slow songs that didnt have me bobbin my head. sorry jeru, but need to go back to the lab and add a pinch of funkiness"
1,Contains MSG,"The ""yeast extract"" in this product acts as MSG does. It is ridiculous that Annie's markets itself as a healthy company for kids and then fills their products with insane amounts of sodium and food additives. Please research all the ingredients before giving these to your children, they are not as healthy as they would have you think."
1,don't be duped,"first of all, these little bunnies are delicious. as the saying goes, 'you can't eat just one'so why do i hate them? because its all a lie. shame. bs. there is more salt in these treats than in your back of potato chips. more salt than SALTED PRETZELS. i know because i just came from the grocery store where i checked the bags / boxes.annies with their cute little bunny and hype about 'oh gee, you can make book marks out of this box' is a load of advertising hype. the remaining ingredients/ nutrients?well, i sought out this whole wheat bunny from their assortment - and only ordered it because it DOES have some fiber - organic [good]. but the other bunnies don't - besides that, there is nothing else to merit this happy dappy pile of bunny-droppings.ps. i just opened another box and am munching away while i type. delicious."
2,Too Salty,"I had to try another box before I wrote this review because it seems hard to believe that I'm the only reviewer who didn't enjoy these. Particularly when someone specifically said ""they're not too salty"". I'm not sure if we got an overly-salted batch, but I'm definitely not on board.My wife and I both felt they were very salty. We were hoping to give them to our baby who's starting on biscuits now but we also want to avoid too much salt.I have a hard time telling if the strong flavor is from the salt or the cheddar.Out of the 5 people who tried it here, only my brother said ""Mmmmmm Cheddar"". I gave him the remaining 11 boxes and hope I have better luck with the Chocolate flavored ones."
3,Emo - This Is My Home,"When people think of dub, Jamaica usually comes to mind. So it's quite surprising to consider that Emo and his debut album This Is My Home has what appears to be a Scandinavian last name. Chalk it up to globalization. But there definitely is that laidback dub vibe running through the entire album, from the opening title track to his collaboration with Boozoo Bajou (""Can't Take No More""). ""Relief for Fire"" settles into a house tempo but maintains the good feeling. ""The Real Thing"" establishes a more romantic, swooning mood, while ""High in the Sky"" goes for a downtempo R&B feel. ""Minds Work"" pumps up the BPM to something danceable and ""Breakadawn"" goes in for some deep funk. It's definitely listenable, but needs a little more to make it essential."
3,"Excellent Writer, Disappointing Book","Fans of Stanley Booth's True Adventures Of The Rolling Stones might wish to check out this one also. Mr. Booth discusses how that he first met the individual members and offers other anecdotes concerning the band and those around them, material that was not included in True Adventures. Unfortunately these reminiscences are a relatively small part of the book. The quotes from Ian ""Stu"" Stewart and Alexis Korner are illuminating, but this book is mostly direct quotes from Mr. Richards and he tends to go on at great length in his post-80's,rather self-important style. Those who would like to read an interview with Mr. Richards before that his head got too big to get through the doorway should seek out the interview that he did with Robert Greenfield in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971. And of course Mr. Booth's superb True Adventures Of The Rolling Stones also predates Mr. Richards attack of swelled-head syndrome."
4,Keith is The Man,"This book is the tops! If you want a insiders look at the man who started it all, then pick this book up."
5,OutLaw Star Girl Sayz Wow!,"These movies are great, I've seen them on Toonami and It's a super seires. Gene, the main character pilots the Outlaw Star a super ship stolen from the pirates/space police. Jim his partener is a much more cautous fellow, and younger. He stays by his compadre's side through thick and thin. Then there's Malfina..she is a special android who was stolen from the pirates by Hot Ice Hilda...speaking of Hot Ice Hilda...she dies very early in the seires (which isn't really a tragidy to me..seeing as i don't really like her that much.) but the rest is history. Gene and his gang travel around the space and have many adventures...it's very interresting."
2,Not big enough,"This case is sturdy and it will protect your laptop, but if you are like me and want to cary power adapters, I-Pod, external backup hard Drive and couple of network cables this case does not have enough room and is not expending well."
4,Excellent,"These binoculars are really great. We have a pond behind our house and they work just fine for that application. I haven't had the chance to use them in the field, so I cannot make a recommendation for hunters, bird watchers, etc.My only regret is only having one pair!"
1,Bushnell binocular review,"I live on a small lake and like to view the wild life....the binocular were more power than I needed, plus much to heavy for me to handle. I felt they were a good product, just not for me."
1,Worst binoculars I have ever owned,"The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over. I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE. Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens. I called Bushnell's help line and they told me...""Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"" When asked about the stuff on the inside. ""That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"" I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!! He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!! They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck."
5,"Easy to focus, wide-angle make it easy to see even if you're new to binoculars","I've tried using professional-grade binoculars before, and I always struggle with the focus and then I keep losing things in the visual field because the field is narrow.I love these binoculars because they have a very wide visual field--once you view something, you can track it easily as it moves.I bought it for a beach vacation, so I could sit on the porch and watch the boats, hang gliders, and swimmers on the ocean. These binoculars were perfect for that. I imagine that they would be good for following any fast-moving object, such as at a ball game or for birding.The lens quality was excellent--far better than I expected for the price.I highly recommend these binoculars to anyone who's been frustrated by binoculars in the past."
5,Very good optics,"I agree with most of the other users. The quality of this binocular is excellent. Strap and lenses cover are cheap but that is irrelevant. I have used them at the jungle, at the beach, to look at stars and in the city with very good results. Overall I would assign a high price/value ratio."
1,Worthless,"The first pair arrived with one of the lens barrels snapped off. The replacement pair would not focus on one side. After two bad pairs, I've decided to go with another brand. Thanks Amazon for the easy returns."
4,10x50 Binoculars,This is the first pair of binoculars that i ordered and i wasn't completely disapointed. I Mean for general nature viewing their okay but for star gazing and looking at things at a distance i suggest you buy a pair with higher magnification. Alright for the money but definitely not for astronomy even if there pairs are your first ones.
5,"Incredible value for birders, astronomers, etc.","I am an avid birder as well as a star-lover. These binoculars are incredible! I have them on my table at all times to watch birds with, and they go with me on any hike or camping trip I take.The initial setup is super-easy, and once you do that, they are some of the best I've used for tracking down and focusing on a moving object. A quick finger-toggle slides the focus for you without losing track of what you're looking at. I've in fact bought many sets of these binoculars for friends and family as gifts because they were so useful for me, and now I have a wide following addicted to these binoculars.The image of course is fantastic, well lit and good sized!If you have any sort of interest in nature, astronomy, sports, or just about anything else which involves viewing objects at a distance, these are definitely the binoculars to try. You won't be disappointed."
1,Arrived Defective - Absolutely Poor Quality Control,"Arrived with barrels out of alignment - thus saw 2 offset images from left and right sides.Focus was loose enough to move back & forth as I used it.Minor but indicative of lack of QA - rubber on eyepiece came unassembled.I returned immediately.In my mind, you are taking a major chance with this product.Made in China - suggest you read the book ""Poorly Made in China"" warning companiesabout the need to assure against the continual lowering of quality there - of whichthis product is an excellent example."
3,Average,Probably Ok for the money. I have had these before and they serve the basic purpose. For serious viewing I would spend a little more money.
1,Poor Quality,I received these as a Christmas present. The two sides are not aligned correctly and thus you see two images.
5,STRAP & LENS COVERS,"THE STRAP THAT COMES WITH THE BINOCULARS IS TERRIBLE AND THE LENS COVERS FALL OFF, OTHERWISE THE BINOCULARS ARE EXECLLENT."
4,Good Binoculars,"The neck strap is cheezy and the lens covers don't fit very well, but the bag is nice and they do the job. The binoculars themselves seem sturdy and well made. A nice piece of equipment."
3,Before Mission of Burma,"This record is a charming late 70's pop punk record that is mainly of interest to fans of Mission of Burma, as it is Clint Conley and Roger Miller's pre-burma band. You can hear them working towards the sound that would make their next band one of the most influential of the 80's."
3,My least favorite of the Delaney brothers trilogy.,"I so enjoyed Chad's story that I searched high and low to find this one about Ryan. He was the charmer of the 3 brothers who liked women but avoided committment. Can't believe how disappointed I was in this story line. Ryan turns out to be a sleep with anyone, shallow person until the last 2 chapters and it gets repetitive listening to it. However the book talks about his womanizing and fortunately doesn't take through all his adventures> ""Kitty"" is a naive, from the wrong side of the tracks girl, who never quite catches my heart. I love Connie Mason books. She is a talented writer. This book is mediocre compared to her many triumphs. Fortunately I forced myself to finish it since the last chapter with his brothers coming to his aid was the best part of the book."
2,Needed a better hero,"This book had potential to be a fun, if campy, adventure. Too bad the characters, plot, and dialogue got in the way.Almost from the start, the hero, Ryan, jumps to conclusions about the heroine. Considering that he sleeps with a prostitute in the first chapter, he has no right to be judgmental or jealous.For her part, Kitty is smarter and more capable than most ""feisty"" heroines. However, there must have been something in the water, because before long, she starts jumping to conclusions, too.The plot hinges on too many coincidencs and used too many cliches. The dialogue is stilted, and peppered with distracting dialogue tags such as ""snarled"" and ""sniffed.""I gave this book a D-"
2,Not as nice as i thought,"Nice dials but the ""wood"" is cheap looking and it is not as nice looking in person as it is on the web site. I am returning mine and finding something better.I would not buy from this company again. The packageing was cheap brown paper and the box was crushed on the corner.It was not packaged well and I am very dissapointed in the company."
2,Home Weather Station,This weather station is a very nice looking product that does not perform. The three gauges move very little if at all. The thermometer varies by perhaps a degree when my digital thermometer is showing degree changes by as much as five degrees or more. The barometer gauge has not moved at all even after tapping on the gauge. The humidity gauge has moved up shortly from the very low setting when I received the unit.If you want accuracy don't buy this product.
3,Home Weather Station,"This is a beautiful Home Weather Station. The price is a bit high,and it's a bit hard to read at first.I'll give 3 *** out of 5 ***** After a few days I decided it was too hard to read and returned it."
3,"A masterpiece opera and a good, not great, performance","This is one of the most beautiful operas of the twentieth century. Of course, Britten had a great librettist. Using about fity percent of Shakespeare's text, he managed to keep the dramatic line taut and to preserve the integrity of the characters. This performance was uneven but pleasurable. But an uneven recording of such a great opera is better than a good recording of less fascinating works. Asawa and LLoyd are very good, Mc Nair also although her performance doesn't quite catch fire. (I saw her do Tytania at the Met where it did catch fire. It's oddly engineered; the sound seems quite uneven, making me wonder if the mikes or performers were moving around some of the time. The fairy soloists were a little off-pitch from time to time and underppowered which is a pity since they get some of the best music."
3,Not the best,"This is one of my favorite operas, and it's nice to have several versions, but I would not start with this recording. The pace seems very slow to me, and the performance lacks the energy of Hickox's performace and the sheer beauty and magic of Britten's. A somewhat interesting alternative, but I would recommend one of the others as a first choice."
4,drunk out of your mind,I have heard some of this record at a party. It was played over a low power fm station. You have to be really high and laughing your you know what off to play this record. I think I had about 5 or 6 strong drinks in my the times I heard this record. You will laugh hysterically and want to get it off as fast as you put it on. If you want to get people riled up play this record.
4,Good but...,"I was moments away from purchasing this but decided to call local knife ship for any details and found out the clock wasnt waterproof. So seeing as i am in my school cadets experiencing rain, lake and mud i really needed a sturdy tool that i wouldnt be afraid to get wet. but with thorough research this was probably best tool for your average user who doesnt want the classic red handles. so good size, colour, design, tools but not waterproof."
3,"""Climber"" with a clock & Pen","This knife is same as the Climber with a pen and clock in the side. The climber is significantly less expensive and the clock will likely not last as long as the knife. (If my climber going on 20+ years is any indication). Victorinox is my favorite of the two official swiss army knife manufacturers, (The other is Wagner) but this knife is not."
3,Needs better hardware,I purhased this product to fit a tight space so it works for that but it was a bit hard to put together due to the cheap screws that came with it.
4,Cheap adapter that works,It is cheap and it works. If you have XP with SP3 you don't need the CD : plug it it and it'll work. Reception is not the best but it stays connected even with a low signal.Side note : The seller I got it from sent me a refurbished item labelled as new.
2,AnnieG experience with Belkin Wireless Notebook Adapter,"Complicate to install, instructions are not very clear. I can be able to use it since I received it and it came very late more days than it supposed to be."
2,Never saw the 10x wireless speed promised,"I purchased this adapter to replace a linksys that was purchased in 2006. I went back to the linksys. This adapter was exactly like my other adapter - it wasn't any faster or slower, did not show any more or less networks - it was equivalent. I was very disappointment in the hype it received only to go back to a device that is 5 years its senior."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7 or Linux,This card may work with Windows XP but I cannot find drivers that work for Windows 7 or Linux.If you plan to use it with Windows 7 or Linux BUY A DIFFERENT WIRELESS NETWORK CARD.
2,Ok but not for my laptop,"I m not to impress with this card. I installed it the second day I received it and it seem to work good. I was kind of surprise to see so many other networks that I haven't seen with my old wireless card. I turned off my laptop after a few hours of surfing than I turn it back on and it wasn't working anymore. The wireless card didn't find any networks. I did many things including; shutting off my laptop a few time and restarted, taking the wireless card off and putting it back on, re-stalling the whole program more than once this will connect to other network except my). I m not sure what happened but I sent back for a refund. Now I m using my old Netgear WG511v2 wireless card, which I don't have any problem except the range is not to strong."
5,Belkin Wireless Adapter,"Excellent product and price. Follow the instructions for installing the software. Works great ! Very fast for my old HP laptop. I bought this to replace the internal wireless that died. This is nice. I leave it in even in the backpack. In the summer, I my laptop in my conversion van for traveling and it gets excellent reception through the metal body of the van. No problems at all with it. I highly recommend this one for older laptops. I'm running XP Pro on mine and it is flawless."
5,Belkin wireless adapter,"I used this on a thinkpad 600 e works better then advertised . No problem setting up, it does have a better range"
4,A good read.,I been a science fiction and fantasy fan for over 30 years and at times I now find it hard to find a book I can really enjoy. Silver Eyes was one of them. Enjoyed the charcter development the universe developed by Stachpole. I can recomend this book.
2,"Interesting world, but very slow-paced","Only the most hard-core speculative fiction readers will be able to stick with this book. The plot takes forever to get off the ground. It's very difficult to figure out who belongs to what country/alliance. While the individual characters and their societies are interesting enough, you don't care about any of them. None of this is helped by the book's jumping around between characters from chapter to chapter. This device wears thin even in books I like more. I wish I'd taken this one out of the library."
5,"Good, but needs some editing","This book is great, like all of Mr. Stackpole's books. My one complaint is name editing. In the first line of the first chapter, the main character, Robin Drury, had his name typod as Robert Drury, and then it went on to talk about Robin. I went over it a couple times, because I had no idea where Robert had gone or who this Robin guy was"
1,The usual SNL tripe.,"Sorry, but it's crap. All but the Norm Macdonald bit is the same old junk. We're SNL! We're hip, daring, fearless! Nope, and not funny, either.True wit has to have an intelligence and grace to it.....SNL has more often than not appealed to the lowest in people. We know why. Comics call it ""Dick jokes"". Always gets a laugh, but more important, gets the ratings. We know whats going on, right? Money, money, money.There have been flashes of brilliance down through the years. Its whats kept my interest in it.Not much here, though. If you're somewhat thoughtful, take a pass on this one. If you're shallow, laugh easily, and pride yourself on being PC, this is for you."
3,Fine guitar player.,Gets a little boring after a while but that statement should not be construed to malign his playing. I wish I could play half as well and develop an absolutely unique style like he did.
5,Great album for playing loud and driving fast,"Blush so rocks!!! Every song is addictive...with each track, you find yourself turning it up louder and louder and then just screaming along. With all these guy-band rock-n-rollers out there, it's about time we had a strong female singer to growl and swagger with them. And the guys in the band are so hot, especially that frickin' cute bass player! I can't stop listening to this..."
2,zzzzzzzz,"The production is good and everything, but the songwriting seems a little amateurish, too typical of the standard Garbage-influenced, female-singer, heavy guitar bands that are all over the place. Also, their press release makes a big deal about Mary Cushman's voice, but it's not like it's mind-blowing or anything. She has a good voice, but overall, there's just very little personality here. They may get better with time, who knows."
3,more pop than rock.,"I saw these guys, and girl in Toledo, Ohio a few weeks ago. I saw this cd and bought it to see if i'd like the cd better than the live sound. no surprises here, folks. overproduced pop music with overdriven guitars. it's ok, but i think it's missing the danger that made rock bands fun. point is, if you want good, clean pop music, here you go. another cd to add to your growing collection of disposable music...ie, third eye blind, fuel, matchbox 20 etc. if you want real rock music with soul, look elsewhere."
4,good puzzle book,"This is a good Sudoku book for the beginner. The puzzles aren't as challenging as other books, but they do get harder towards the end. A big plus is that the book contains 150 sudoku puzzles."
4,Good for novices,"As a newly-addicted Sudoku player, I find this book just right. Challenging enough to keep it interesting, but not so difficult as to make me want to quit. I would not recommend this for those who are experts, but for a beginner, this is a perfect book."
3,Good for Beginers,This book would be great for a beginer to Sudoku. But if you have any experince you would find these puzzles lack challenge.
1,"No level identification, hard to find the puzzle with suitable level..","Sudoku puzzles were not classified for their levels in this book so you won't know which one suits your level until you try. This book only has beginner and intermediate puzzles, no challenging one."
4,Book of Sudoku,"If I ever learn, this will be the book.I'm not holding my breathe, but there just might be a chance..."
2,Fun but super easy puzzles,"I discovered the sudoku puzzles in the local newspaper. Since I really enjoyed them, I went out and bought a couple of books. I was very disappointed in this one because they are all very easy and can be completed in 5 minutes or less. I am not an expert in this and just started doing these puzzles about 3 months ago. I have flipped all through the book and have not found a single puzzle that was really a challenge. I think this book is great if you want some easy to solve puzzles but if you want some difficulty to them, I would recommend looking at the Will Shortz books. The puzzles in those books are in order of difficulty and they are challenging and fun to do."
1,NO challenge,"I was very disappointed in this book - great if you have 5 minutes to kill, I suppose, but the puzzles are distressingly easy - I much prefer at least a LITTLE challenge. Don't waste your money on this one - go for something a bit more interesting!"
2,Fragments of great songs,"I was initially very happy to find this CD. It had many songs that I only have on an old tape, eaten by my tape deck various times. The problem became apparent after hearing the first part of a song; the songs are truncated, and blended together! Joe Arroyo is a great singer, but part of what makes many of these songs great is the talent of his band members, and the fabulous instrumentation and solos that have been REMOVED from this compilation. The songs are great, but often, the best part has been cut off. DO NOT MESS WITH PERFECTION! Nowhere on the CD is there an indication that this breach of artistic integrity has taken place. Discos Fuentes has a lot of nerve! Give us the complete songs, and indicate on the CD's cover if you do not! CAVEAT EMPTOR! If there are thirty songs on one CD, something may be fishy!"
1,30 pegaditas de oro - Joe Arroyo,"Me engañaron ... Yo esperaba un CD que trajera las canciones mencionadas en la oferta .. pero finalmente recibo un CD que no tiene ninguna de las canciones ""completas"" ... sólo tragmentos de cada cancion, en ninguna parte hablan de ese detalle. Esto es un robo."
2,No lo compren! Don't buy this!,"Una muy buena selección del Joe, pero las canciones están cortadas. No vale la pena comprarlo!A good selection of songs, but they are all cut after 1 minute. Not worth to buy!"
1,30 Pegaditas de Oro from Joe Arroyo,I was disappointed in ths CD since his music is so good and he is such a good artist. The big problem with this CD is the fact that is only a portion of the songs not the full version leaving the person angry and frustrated. It would a been a great CD if only the songs were in their full version not this one.
1,ROBO - RIP OFF,"Esto es un robo, lo compre pero me siento estafado. Las canciones no vienen completas. This is a steal, I feel they ripped me off. The songs are not completed. Scamers."
3,This is a dance mix,"I do not like dance mixes. Cannot hear to all of the nuances of each song, instead we get only the meat and potatoes of each. However, if you have a party with a bunch of hard dancing salseros, not a bad cd to play."
1,Undiluted Garbage!,"The author's egeocentricism and bad writing makes this book almost unreadable. It is, however, illustrative of how narcissism can deform personality."
5,EXCELLENTEXCELLENT,"EXCELLENT , EXCELLENT ITS A NICE PRODUCT INTERESTING AND SO COMFORTABLE ITS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT ITS COST ITS OK AS THE PRODUT TOO"
5,Great...,"thanks a lot for giving such incredible prices and the quality of the product it's not so bad! You got me!! Client for a long time....again, thank you."
3,Good quality so far,Good quality so far. Seems to solidly built but I have not used it on a daily basis so that may change as time goes on. Zoomed and focused easily and with no issues. A good buy for the price.
3,Disappointed!,"I'm disappointed in these - I can't adjust the eyepieces to the distance between my eyes. Even when I set the eyepieces as close together as possible, the image is still double because the eyepieces are limited in how close you can set them. Other than that, they seem fine, but obviously they are unusable for some people."
3,Okay if you know what you're looking for,"I'm self teaching myself Japanese and Kanji definetly is a hard hurdle to master. While I've only so far used this book to learn Kanji (along with [...]), suffice it to say you need quite a few different methods/tools to learn this difficult aspect of Japanese language. While this book is helpful if you know what you are looking for (by looking back in the glossary for the corresponding Japanese romanji term), it's too much to just to go through and try to learn all of the words, unless you're looking for words you like, like love or whatever. Also, the pneumonics aren't the best in the world, but believe it or not it is actually more helpful to me with my kana then the kanji. While this may be a helpful addition to your collection, I'd say research a bit more before buying this book. If you do, just note that you'll definetly need more than this book if you want to become good at Kanji."
3,Kanji me hole,"It looks great, with nice clear friendly picture on the front, but as another reviewer said, when you bring it home and start to use it you see the problems. The kanji are arranged thematically, which is all well and good if this book is your primary textbook for kanji learning. But if you're taking classes somewhere else and you have a prescribed order to learn the kanji, its not very useful. Secondly, many of the mnemonics are fairly poor (although some are very useful), and thirdly, worst of all, the index is terrible. Many of the characters I tried to find weren't listed.Didn't quite live up to it's promise."
3,"Great for kana, not so much for kanji","I enjoyed this book immensely. The pictures and images are fun and visually appealing, and the explainations of each part are facinating. But I must agree that as a learning tool, it was not very helpful. Mnemonics are usually very helpful for me, but whenever I came across a kanji I first saw in this book, I would recognize it, remember parts of the mnemonic, but compeltely forget what the whole kanji meant!I did however find this book VERY helpful for remembering the kana. In this case, Rowley's mnuemonics helped a great deal."
1,Not good,"Not good for learning. The mnemonics are way to forced, and I could just not get the link between the graph and the meaning. Really not a practical book."
2,Didn't really help me,"I don't particularly care for this book, I bought it because I've seen so much and heard so much about it, that I thought it would help. However, aside from the picture on the front, I couldn't really see the pictures in the kanji, and it didn't help me memorize it any better. I wouldn't necessarily buy this book unless this is really your learning style."
3,"Good for beginners, but soon becomes limiting","This is a fun book to flip through, perhaps with younger learners of Japanese, but the visual method espoused by the author becomes somewhat forced and cumbersome for serious adult learners. A more thorough and systematic approach that breaks Kanji down into radicals such as the book by Henshall or Heisig is more useful.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"
2,Mistakes,"There are so many mistakes in this book. Mis-numbered cross referential numbers and kanji is just wrong are some of the most glaring examples. It is difficult to learn anything when you are second guessing the material. The most embarrassing oversight is the kanji for noisy which is made up of three little kanji women. That kanji is only really used with a power kanji in front to mean rape. Not only is the Kanji useless by itself (assuming you are not living in the Heian period), but it is offensive when you try to use it.The idea of the book is great epically with my learning style, but get a Japanese editor."
3,Wonderful for learning kana!,"At first glance this book looks like the way to solve the problem of learning those tedious kanji in Japanese! It looks like a completely NEW way to do it! But I am not sure it is. Firstly, I have to say that some of the pictures are good for learning the meaning in relation to the shape of the kanji, like the one on the front...but what about the ON and KUN readings? They still have to be learned somehow! They are included in the book, but the kanji are not placed in any context that might help you relate them to vocabulary. This is an interesting innovation which is, I daresay, helpful, but not definitive. However, I can say with my hand on my heart that Mr Rowley took a lot of the pain out of learning the kana with the ingenious drawings he came up with (even if the pronunciation is ostensibly American!)."
4,Good to refer to,It's a good book to help you remember what each kanji means. But the book makes it a bit confusing with the 2 definition for each kanji. One is for Chinese and the other one is for Japanese. Sometimes I wasn't sure which one was which meaning.
1,This is not a good way to learn Kanji,Go instead withRemembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters by James W. Heisig
5,Very understandable,"This book breaks down Japanese kanji into easy to relate to pictures. In the beginning, it does the same thing for katakana and hiragana, which I'm trying to learn.Pros:UnderstandableEasy to readLots of infoCons:Takes awhile to memorize each characterHave to work on it regularlyNot all the kanji in common use are listed thereStill, its a great book!"
2,Not very good,"Many of the pictures used in this book are not very well suited to the kanji presented. The cover is the best one of the book, some were just horrible that left no logic between the kanji and the picture. I bought ""read Japanese today"" and found it much better for learning kanji."
2,again with the ideographic myth,"Like far too many books about Kanji, this one chooses to focus on the ""meanings"" conveyed by the characters rather than the phonetic and morphological information they supply which is their real function. I will give this an extra star though, because some of the illustrations and mnemonics are clever.Ivan Rorick"
3,Didn't help...,"While this sounds like a super-great idea, it really doesn't help. 90% of the picture mneumonics don't help very much, and are just crude picture forms of the radicals. And it helps nothing at all with the actual Japanese. While I applaud Micheal Rowley for thinking up a few good pictoral references, don't invest your money in this book. It's better to learn like the Japanese do: writing the kanji, meaning, and pronunciation over and over again."
4,Good and simple!,Great Book. Its all photos which is what you want! The secret key to one of the oldest alphabets in the world.
3,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","This book presents approximately 1,000 kanji characters, along with mnemonics designed to help you memorize the meanings. For example, on the cover, the book suggests that the character for ""stop"" looks like a policeman saying ""stop!""It's a good idea, but the bottom line is that most of the entries just are not that good. For example, the character for ""horse"" really looks like a horse. You shouldn't need any help noticing that. The book twists the character into a different, and much less plausible, horse.Try ""Essential Kanji: 2,000 Basic Japanese Characters Systematically Arranged For Learning And Reference"" instead. It is much more useful."
3,"Fun, beautiful book. Not sure how useful a study tool.","This is a lovely book and a recommend to anyone who enjoys collecting everything on the subject (like me!) get a copy.As a serious study aid it is lacking - it doesn't cover all recommended characters and is pretty limited on compounds too.Great to look at, great to review part of the subject, but not part of a serious study scheme.Heisig is more comprehensive, though for simple ease of use, and results I can't recommend anything more highly than K. Henshall""s ""Remembering The Japanese Characters"". I keep a copy at home on my desk and one at work for quiet moments too.Subarashii!"

4,Great Series-Crappy Box,"This is probably the best comedy series, along with Fawlty Towers, to come out of the UK and this series #6 is the best one of the lot. But what's with the crappy plastic box? I ordered the other 2 sets online and they were beautifully packaged in gatefold sleeves with a written prelude to each episode inside. This one was delivered and the box turned up damaged, with one of the discs loose and bouncing around. Why do they make a decision to change a good thing? The packaging on the first 2 sets was so much better. Anyway, 5 stars for the series, minus one for that useless cheap plastic box!"
5,The funniest comedy series of all time,Quite simply the funniest comedy series of all time...and this set contains probably the best moment of the series when Del is at the wine bar.
2,Information is not reliable,"Unfortuately, this book follows a trend of Video Poker books. There's just not that much new in the knowledge of video poker that hasn't been written by Dan Paymar, Bob Dancer and others. Instead of trying to present the same information in a better manner, it chooses to conflict with well-established understandings of VP to pursue ill-fated ""short-term"" strategies that have no basis in the VP community. You are much better off with the standards than you are with this book or Singer's book."
3,Powerful Profits From Video Poker,The book was very redundant. Essential information could have been said in 50 pages. The seller was very quick to respond and courteous. The condition of the book was as described.
1,"unless you're painting it, don't buy it","I've seen low quality side mirrors, but this, is the worst quality ever. I bought it as a mistake, since I was looking for a Suburban mirror, and the picture misleaded me.Plastic is not even poor quality automotive plastic, this I rated -5 stars(minus 5 stars)I don't recommend this to nobody."
5,AnnLuvs2shop,This product is great and affordable. The mirrors look great on my husband's S10 pickup truck.
5,TVP frontman bounces back!,"Brian VanderArk was/is the leading talent behind The Verve Pipe's platinum selling album ""Villains"" and he delivers a stellar performance in his latest solo project ""Resurrection."" With brilliantly crafted melodies and lyrics, Brian VanderArk has put together a package that is sure to attract many new fans from all genres of music. This album is a MUST for any past or present TVP fan and it is DEFINITELY worth your while to have a listen."
2,Air Wing Photos,"Mostly just photos of the air wing, if you were ship's company prepare to be snubbed. In fact if you served aboard her and took some photos yourself save your money and drag out the photo album and cruise books."
3,"Girlfriend loved it, missing some items though","EDIT: Just realized some of the items promised are missing... Disappointing.Gave this gift to my girlfriend, she loved it. Has all the items listed, reasonable price, all the contents are in good condition. The main downside was that it took almost a week for the seller to ship the order. Once shipped, it arrived fairly quickly, though. Also, the bottom of the box is falling apart, & the inside of the mug appears to be dirty. Overall, I'm satisfied. Quality and customer service just needs to improve a little."
5,an amazing knife but see if it theright 1 for you,"This knife is amazing, I have been collecting Victorinox knives since I was 8 and have over 75, so I am a very qualified person in this subject. This is an amazing knife it has every basic tool plus more, you can even use it to hammer in a nail, (but don't use the handles). The only problem with it is the size makes it hard to grip and use the awsom screwdriver. If you want it mainly for the screwdriver I suggest buying 1 of the cybertools because they are smaller and way easer to grip. I work as a yacht captain and use the cybertool 34 every day. The amazing thing about Victorinox is that they make a knife, (or as I perfer the term multi tool because if you've noticed it doesn't only have a knife), so first befor you buy a knife check out which one fits your purpose. lastthing is stay away from the cheep Wenger knives, they are not as good and Victorinox is the Origional and Wenger is a fake copy cat."
1,Crap,I pulled the ring out just to get a feel for the length and it slides right out. It can be fixed but.. come onnnnnn! Really!? I knew it was cheap but not that cheap.
2,died less than 2 month of below normal use,"product seemed quite reliable and thin metal chain cord belt clip are really strong. however, it broke yesterday. I tried to fix this by myself so I unscrewed, to find that core part of the spring mechanism was poorly welded and there was no way for me to fix."
3,Not The Best,"I bought 2 of these because of the price and the fact that maybe one would be no good. The 1st one's cable broke after a few days. I took it apart and repaired it and the cable broke again after a few days. The only thing I can figure is that it had a sharp piece of metal that wore through it right at where it's connected. I'm using the second one now for about a week, and it seems to be ok."
5,A treasure trove of great music...and WHAT a voice.,"The previous five reviews about said it all. This proper box of Mildred Bailey is a treasure trove of great pop music and what a wonderful singer she was...is, and every bit as cool as Billie Holiday. Another great bargain from the folks at Proper. Now if only they would do sets for the Andrews and Boswell sisters."
5,Wonderful cookbook!,"I've had this cookbook about 12 years, and it is fantastic! Big, beautiful color photos let you see what the finished results will be. The recipes also tell you the nutritional breakdown of each dish. There is an excellent variety of appetizers, breads, main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. The recipes are easy to make and delicious. This book is BIG and has hundreds of wonderful, colorful, healthful recipes. The price offered here is excellent! I highly recommend this cookbook. Enjoy!"
3,Cook Book order,"I ordered a secon-hand book which came in very good condition, on time, packaged well. No complaints at all!"
4,Ole Rog does it again!,"Pretty basic stuff for a veteran tractor enthusiast, but the humor is worth checking out. Rog does a great job, especially on the workshop and tools section, which even the most experienced tractor fan will identify with!"
2,Should have researched better,"Don't get me wrong - I am a HUGE Roger Welsch fan and have several of his books - this is why I rushed out to aquire this latest release. My wife got it for me for Christmas and unless you are completely clueless about antique tractors, or internal combustion theory in general, you will have a very hard time chewing through this one. It is so basic you could use it to describe the inner workings of an antique tractor to a 3 year old city boy. I am sure it has some of old Rog's witty banter in it - but I couldn't get past the first chapter. Buy it for your significant other in hopes they will read and at least understand what you are talking about at the next antique tractor show."
1,AWFUL - doesn't work,"I mean literally won't spray. I shook the can as directed and when I pressed down on the nozzle I got a thin worm of white that looked more like a disease than paint. I assume that some of the paint congealed and once the ""jelled"" portion was evacuated, it was followed by globs of paint that spattered my intended work. I even switched to clean nozzles and got the same results. I have used countless spray cans in my hobby but never encountered anything like this. Krylon is a good product but this line of H2O latex is a miserable failure. Try again Krylon !!!"
2,Not worth the money.,"Since it is an older product the batteries in it corroded so the sound doesn't work. Since my son thinks Santa brought it, I'm just keeping it."
3,Educational preparation for children's future,"This entertaining diarama featuring Jasper in his humble retirement home is truly a quality educational tool for children. I have tried other ""educational"" products like MathBlast and that plastic ATM intended to help children learn to use a bank, but I believe that this Simpson's playset is much more successful in preparing your child for reality.Kids can learn techniques that they can use later (much later) in their lives when they too are living in retirement homes - techniques such as ""how to navigate within cramped living quarters"", ""how to cope with a broken television"", and ""decorating your room to combat depression."" After all, when we too are facing death in a run-down nursing home, I would feel good knowing that I've been properly prepared for this misery."
4,Not bad,"For those who enjoy William O'Neil's newspaper INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY and his book HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS, INVESTING SMART is a worthwhile book. In short, this volume is a clearly written, well organized introduction of how to use IBD in stock picking. My guess is that the book was written for those who do not know too much about the newspaper; frequent readers who already fully utilize IBD's wealth of information will probably not find much here. Even so, this book still might be valuable to them as a refresher course. The only gripe I had was that the book largely seemed like a watered-down version of CANSLIM, O'Neil's renowned system to finding winning stocks. Those looking for innovative approachs to using IBD's material, hence, may be disappointed. For them, this book might have value anyway as a useful supplement to one of the best stock-trading systems in existence."
2,"Too Many Words, Too Little Information","Being a student of William O'Neil's CANSLIM method of stock selection I found this book tiresome to read mainly because I know the subject matter so well. Dr. Sethna was certainly long winded and rambling in his writing style and could have said what he did in a third of the space he used. If you desire to learn about William O'Neil's methods purchase his book, ""How to Make Money In Stocks."" Lastly, Investor's Business Daily has added many new features since Dr. Sethna wrote this book so some of the information he shares about the paper is dated."
2,Bad presentation,"I was very excited to find a book that was going to give me more ideas on how to pick stocks using IBD. While this book did give information on IBD, it never got into anything I found helpful in really using to pick stocks. All the author did was present information I already knew by reading IBD myself. Also this was not a pure IBD product the author attempted to mix in several authors advice and techniques into this work by quoting them verbatim. The book was very dry and hard to read and I do not think beginners or veteran traders will find it helpful. It was written by a doctor, who may be a great trader, but I did not like his writing style. I would advise reading all of William O'Neal's book and stick with IBD alone to teach you. Find your stock picks in the IBD 100, you do not need this book."
1,This book sucks..,I bought this book a year and a half or so ago and I think it was a bad investment. I figured this book would be a great addition to How to make money in stocks but I was wrong.This book is basically scanned in pages of parts of the paper telling you about all the economic indicators and other items in Investor's Business Daily.I feel this book could have been a lot better if Dhun Sethna hadn't spent most of his time talking about such a boring subject... I mean who really wants to interpret economics graphs... I know I don't. He could have discuss how to find the winners (like the title suggests) but from what I remember about this book it is just about what the paper is and all the economic indicators you can find in it. I can clearly see why William O'Neil doesn't recommend this book.Reed Floren
4,She Go,"Using this in an application that is kinda tricky. It is sending water up my homemade stream roughly 10 feet into a 3"" pipe. This exceeds what it is supposed to be able to do. Yet it was able to perform great. It goes on every night, runs for 8 hours, then I turn it off. It has been performing flawlessly."
4,Great Pump,"Although I have only had the pump running for about two months, it seems to be working well.Pro: The pump is quiet and powerful.Con: I wish Amazon would have published the electric consumption ie: watts. The reason being, this pump is operated on an off-grid system. Meaning that we have limits to the electric we produce depending on our solar output, so electric consumption needs to be carefully monitored. This pump uses a little too much electric and therefore we have to shut it down at night. I see this as a problem when we get into the freezing nights ahead."
3,Mmmmm... Yummy!,"So, I picked these up from the local grocery store the other day and thought that I would give them a try. I have to say that I like them enough to pay $3 per can, but only every once and a while. There are actually three peppers in the can. They are tasty, but are mostly just rice with lots of flavor. Obviously I liked them enough to look online for them, but I must confess that I was looking to get them cheaper, maybe for like $2.50 per can...."
5,Super Sheep by Ken Davis,"This is a super video about how to become super sheep...the wolves, snakes, etc want to attack, but the sheep with the Good Shepherd can prevail. Ken is at his best in this taped presentation. If you've never been blessed to hear him before, here's a great example of how he presents the Word in a different manner...one that will touch you and one which you will remember."
4,"Good show, Good DVD Transfer",Each Disk contains 2 Episodes of this series which seems odd considering the fact that it would be more efficent to have all 4 parts on one disk and shift the special features onto the bonus disk. Wish it was in widescreen but the transfers are very good as is.
5,Anime is awesom...,"Awesome Anime. Perfect condition, very fast shipping. I recommened to Anime lovers lol no seriously I really enjoed the Anime. So you who enjoy watching anime please check this one out."
3,too slow,the goodvisuals are very well done for it time. I can tell is was traditionally animated because how colors looks. The line art is very well done.The action scenes are exitingthe badMacross plus has love triangle in it that not so clear. I just realize it had one after watching. It spends too much time on characters. episode 2 feel like it was dragging it feet. Lot stuff that was happen front and center should been in back ground. The I.A. should have gone rouge in episode 2 leave the rest of mini series action packed how ever it does go rouge until end of episode 3 when the mini series is 69 percent over.fan serviceSharon Apple the A.I. appears a few times in low detail nudity. The reason that write this because in the ratings it does not say what it rated for. on youtube it just says it is rated tv-14.
5,The countryside comes to life!...,"I kid you not, of all the recorded performances of the `Pastoral' I've heard in my life, Masur's interpretation with the Gewandhausorchester seems to me the BEST! It is absolutely ideal.The `Pastoral' seems to be Beethoven's most demanding symphony. All the other Beethoven symphonies can be performed okay by just about any orchestra, but the `Pastoral' is special: if it's not played JUST RIGHT, it doesn't seem to work... I've heard so many dud recordings of this work, it seems to require a certain rare talent (on the part of conductor and the orchestra) to bring the magic out, to make this work `click'...And Masur's reading really brings this symphony to life! You really feel enchanted by the countryside as the music conveys the idea of the most beautiful pastoral scenery...So challenge me! If you feel you've heard a better rendering of the `Pastoral' somewhere else, I'd love to hear about it!"
2,many better recordings,"unless you are a particular fan of this conductor there is no reason to purchase this recording. It is simply put, boring. There are many finer recordings in many different styles to choose from."
5,Nice binoculars,I have bought a few binoculars in the past couple of years. And have been satisfied with only a couple. These binoculars I am very pleased with. The clarity is very good and the price is terrific. I have wasted alot of money on some not so good Bushnell binoculars. But this pair was a pleasant surprise.
1,Don't Buy,"These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair."
2,Broke easily and warranty stinks,Purchased these as a gift and they were fine briefly until the internal parts failed. Contacted Bushnell and the warranty is useless -- costs more to have them repaired under warranty than to buy new ones. Get a grip Bushnell.
3,Binoculars not great,"Delivery was very prompt and the price for these binoculars was good, but the quality was not as good as previous reviews led me to believe. Perhaps because I wera glasses, I had a little difficulty in focus. Also, the view is not as bright as my old set. In short, don't expect more in quality than what you pay for these Bushnell Binoculars."
1,why do they take so long to ship?,Hi I ordered these on 12-5-05 and they have still not shipped I was hoping to get them for Christmas but now maybe Valentines Day? Now they say I won't get them until March I would choose other binoculars. The binoculars have finally shipped. We will finally be able to see if they are worth the wait.
4,Great for backyard birding,"I bought this so we could get a better look at the birds in our backyard. We keep it by the kitchen window, and find ourselves using it at least once a week to peek at a feathered friend who is visiting. Nice clear lens, pretty easy to find objects through them. Certainly does the job we need it to do. Don't buy this if you do your birding out in the field - these are not particularly portable nor leightweight and are not meant to be; buy a binocular specifically made for that purpose.Only complaint, and it is minor, is that I find the lens caps to be flimsy and a little hard to use. We generally just keep them off."
2,Boresight error,"Although they work fine for close up (less than 50 feet) views, the pair I received had a significant boresight error between the two sides. This results in double images of far away objects. I suppose it has to do with the all-plastic construction. There was also a piece of plastic missing next to the focus control."
1,this is a piece of garbage,"for one thing, this movie is more about making sharks look like monsters, than it is about great white sharks. if you expect to learn much from this video, keep looking. they hardly show anything about great white sharks. half of the video is about other things than great white sharks. the other half is about how sharks love attacking people."
5,Great lil' bell,This bell is so cute and really reminds one of childhood.It's also a great price and has a nice ring to it!
5,Cute!,We purchased this bell for our two year old's Kettler Kettrike Air Happy Tricycle. It fits perfectly on the handle bars and was very simple to install with just one screw. Now everyone can hear him coming!
5,red bell,Little kids love the sound of it. It's just like when we were kids. It hasn't changed.The bell is an attraction to the trike. The child wants to go to ride the trike and ring the bell.
5,What a great deal,The quality is excellant for the cost. The sound is classic and is a great way to get someones attention when your coming up behind them.
2,Ringer doesn't ring well.,"The bell seemed to work well for the first week or two, then for some reason the ringer sounds dull. It still rings, just doesn't have a good clear ring like it did. I would probably try another brand if I'd get another one since this one didn't seem to last."
2,it's a timex but....,I have always worn Timex watches and was intrigued by the perpetual calendar but that feature is not worth the weight of the watch. It's too heavy and am going to buy another model and put this one away.
4,A great start to finding the right music for your wedding!,I used this CD to get just a few ideas for my wedding. Everything that is in my cermony is from this CD. It was very helpful. I highly recommend it.
4,"WONDERFUL, INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC","Of course, this is a 'must' CD for any one planning on getting married, or re-marrying. Great sounds and feelings for the ceremony. However, keep in mind, this music is also everyday inspirational and pleasant to listen to - very relaxing and at the same time, helping to stimulate creative thoughts if you're a writer or artist. Be careful to not lend it out (unless you have a long string attached) because likely it will not come back real soon, or ever. People enjoy everything about this CD - a good one."
5,Interesting and helpful,"Terrific book -- both interesting to read (especially the stories of how other women used the web to become successful) and helpful (containing tips on how you can do it too.) It was also very practical, especially (at least for me)the section on growing your business on the Internet. I've read other books in this area, which were very dry, but this was a fast read and a very helpful one as well. I highly recommended this book -- and you don't have to be a female to enjoy it."
5,"Magic, Mystery and Mayhem on the streets of NYC","This is one of the books I keep as a treasure. A young girl makes a wish in a river--and gets a surprising answer. Together, three people must work to save NYC from a monstrous kraken that has worn down the protections of the city. This is a heart warming story with plenty of teary-eyed moments. I started this series with the second book, but this is my favorite of the three. It's a coming of age story, with adventure and magic mixed in. For those girls who've read Harry Potter and want something a little older and more female focused, this might be just your thing."
5,Childhood Favorite..,"This book is what every fantasy should be like. It's perfect, exciting, funny and thoroughly wonderful. All fantasy fans and fans of New York City should read this book!"
3,"Undescriptive, stereotypical plot","The first thing about this book that bugged me was the fact that it had extremely undescriptive writing. 'I saw my mom. She slapped me so hard I saw stars.' Doesn't say much, does it?I find the plot to be very steriotypical: there is a big monster that's going to destroy the whole world, and you're the ONLY ONE who can stop it!Also, the characters seem to have almost no personality. I had to write a book report on this book, and when they asked, the only difference that I could find between Joel and Paavo was that Paavo smoked tobacco, and Joel smoked marijuana. I think that speaks for itself.And one last thing, it bugged me when, when the monster was there, she threw her little coin purse at it that was full of silver coins that her Grandma gave her! Like that's going to do anything. What a waste."
2,This was SUCH a stereotypical book!,"Not only was this book one of the typical, some little fourteen-year-old-girl-has-to-save-the-world-or-it-will-all-be-destroyed book, which it was, but also the writing was REALLY undescriptive. I don't have an example right now, because I had to borrow the book from the teacher, but I can remember that it was really annoying, to the point where I actually noticed, which is really saying something.And sometimes, people did really stupid things that they knew would have had no effect whatsoever, like at the end, when the monster was in the water, she threw her wallet at it, which was full of silver coins that her grandma gave to her! Useful. I would have done that, too...And if I came home and the linoleum from the kitchen floor was gone, I would be at least sort of freaked out..."
3,Almost good enough,"I bought this kit as a ""spare spare"" for my SUV. You never know when one spare is enough and getting out of the back country is important.It has everythong I need, but the inflator (air pump) is too wimpy. The warnings instruct:1. Do not operate for more than 8 minutes continuously.2. Allow compressor to cool 25 minutes between uses.It's probably good enough for a car, but I'm getting a more capable compressor for the SUV. I don't care if it pumps slow, as long as it won't break if I forget to set a timer.The other troubling thing is the warning to run the compressor only with the engine turned off. Over voltage protection isn't that expensive and I don't want to risk discharging my battery. When far from civilization, a dead battery is worse than a flat tire."
5,An ounce of prevention,"Slime is great stuff and does seal leaks just as it claims. This is a great deal for a compressor and a bottle of slime. I've seen the slime alone in the store costing more then the combo. I carry one, my wife carries one and now I've put them in our sons cars. You can't go wrong. I've been using slime products since 2000. Never a failure only success."
4,Diversified,"I own every album Miguel has made and in my opinion this album comes straight from Miguels soul. He has also included his reggae feel in this album. I feel this album includes more sub-genres of house music feel than any of his other previous albums. If you want more musical ideas to create your own compositions, this album will trigger more ideas with several subhouse genres."
2,Very disappointing,"From one of the best deep house DJs, this is substantially below par. He should stick to compilation releases and leave the recordings to true musicians/artists. I felt there was no soul to this CD, as the tracks seem predictable and cheesy. His first artist album (Colorful You) was better, as well as his many DJ CDs - In The House and 24th St. are his best works."
2,Not what I thought.,"I thought the album sounds too much like 70's funk or disco. Not ""deep"" enough in my opinion. What I have come to love about Miguel is he smart lyrics and smooth dreamy beats. This album was short on both."
3,"This is the shallow end --- don't dive in if you are expecting anything ""deep""","First of all, Migs is by far THE BEST house DJ out there. ""Those Things"" just isn't what I expected. Granted, as an artist I'm sure it gets rather boring putting out mixes (24th street sounds, etc.), but the title of this MM orginal cuts CD should have been ""Too Many Things"". Migs is at his best when he strips it down to the bone, and this one has a whole lotta fat. For instance, there are SO many things you can do with an electric guitar, and Migs decided to use the Joe Satriani model for this one; ick, no thanks.Still, you'd be an idiot to pass up seeing him live behind the decks."
4,So Far is worth the price of the CD,I am a Miguel Migs fan and 'So Far' is definitely worth the price of the CD. But I was hoping for more deep house. The rest of the material is OK.
4,Miguel Can Do No Wrong,"Miguel has released better things but, ""Those Things"", will stand the test of time; a truely great Dance album. It features his best abilities to take on what the INDUSTRY asks of a Star. He is able to master both the resurgence of ""Rock"" as a driving force in the sound these days as well as the mainstay vibe of ""Hip Hop"". Thank the Heavens that his genius comes out in every track after #3. In fact, the title track #5, ""Those Things"", is quite simply, unsurpassed. If you haven't purchased this one yet and you truly appreciate Deep House and the eclectic verve that I believe only comes from the San Francisco Bay Area please don't hesitate."
4,Different from the Norm Yet Catchy,"Sometimes it takes going away from a certain style of music to find out what you are really capable of creating. Migs on the other hand did a wonderful job with his latest album ""Those Things"". Although it isn't his ususal style, I was still impressed with this album. It's not a album to club to but more of a relaxing/ hanging out with friends type of mix. Some of my favorite tracks include ""So Far,"" ""Those Things,"" ""Fire,""""Shake It Up,"" and ""Giving It All"". You would not be disappointed with purchasing this album regardless if you are being introduced to Migs for the first time or not."
4,Fantastic Album,"This album is awesome.Very funky,very soulfull,very musical,and some-what original.Every track is worth listening to and there are several outstanding tracks.Not many artists bringin the funk like this today - maybe J. Timberlake and Prince - are the only ones I can think of."
5,The Spaniards Revenge,Peru - what a fantastic setting! I just loved Doctor Sophie Ford - and as for Doctor Xavier - read that cover scene mid sixties page wise is all I'm going to say!
4,WELCOMED COMFORT FROM THE USA,"The winters in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan are brutal. I have a specialfriend who is working over there who is a huge Washington Redskins fan.I was thrilled to find these gloves as a reminder of what he left behind for awhile. I know he welcomed them with joy."
3,Lovely - but incomplete - ballet,"I would recommend this beautiful DVD for the dancing...but the last 5 minutes or so of the ballet have been excised! Yikes!!First, the good - The Dancing! Ferri, as expected, is wonderful as Titania, but equally impressive are other La Scala soloists, such as Brazzo and Zeni in the Act II pas de deux.Now the not-so-good: Alas, folks familiar with the Balanchine ballet will be deeply disappointed that this La Scala version abruptly ends with the 'Italian Divertissement' of which the pdd is the centerpiece. In other words, there's no final reconciliation in the palace & no final scene at the forest, with Puck rising above the stage. For this reason alone, I give this DVD 3 stars. Sorry, I like my ballet DVDs of purportedly ""complete"" ballets to be truly complete. I was shocked and kept wondering if my DVD was flawed...but I see that the earlier TDK DVD release of this film also ran 104 minutes."
4,La Scala Midsummer Nights Dream,"Excellent performance of a Balanchine masterpiece. Alessandra Ferri is a pleasure to watch as Titania. The excellent orchestra, chorus and soloists are far better their counterparts on Pacific Northwest Ballet DVD. I would still love to see a DVD of the 1967 New York City Ballet production of A Midsummer Night's Dream filmed by Columbia Pictures with the incomparable Suzanne Farrell as Titania."
3,Iron wasn't what picture shows,"The iron is light and handle works perfect for me, but do not like the fact that I have to unplug the iron everytime I finish using it.I use for quilting and am always ironing, so hence once you do shut it off, it doesn't go off, have to unplug it. And of course it is not what the picture shows at all."
1,What a piece of garbage,I bought this iron about three months ago and I've only used it 3-4 times. It now refuses to heat up. I tried to contact the company to find out what I need to do to get the warranty activated. They told me that I need to bring it to the nearest service center. Turns out the closest center for Connecticut is out on Long Island. There are no other phone numbers for assistance and no information online. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING SUNBEAM PRODUCTS.
1,There are better books out there to read,"Felt so stilted and contrived that I couldn't finish it. It's one thing to read a happy story written like that, but this one (as least as far as I got) was far from happy. I have liked some Carly Phillips books in the past, but this one just didn't do it for me."
3,A sweet novel,"Solitary Man is a charming novel about adult child of alcoholic who is a police officer and after her partner was killed, he falls for his partner's sister. The characters were good and the message was important but it was not a pager turner."
1,"Stick To The Movie, THAT was a treat!","Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal.The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it.Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file.As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!As for the music, buy the film soundtrack. It's lovely, this is not."
4,Great but best song missing,This soundtrack is amazing Julie andrews blows me a way... The only thing that is wrong is that Le jazz hot is not on this album...
2,Not Quite,"The show isnt a flop, just not a hit. The Music and rhymes seem a bit forced. I'm sorry but, Andrews does not impress me in this role. The music isnt bad, but the lyrics are unavoidable. For collectors (like myslef) and Andrews fans this is a good one to get, for those looking for some catchy show tunes, this is not quite it. If I had to pick a best song on the album it would be ""Living in the Shadows"""
3,Julie is a Saint.....,"It was a shame that the return of Julie Andrews to Broadway had to be embodied in this weak musical, as evidenced by this CD. Andrews is poorly served by much of the material, with music and lyrics sometimes so bad that you can't help but wince. Still, this CD gives a good feeling for the show and the cast struggles (and often succeeds) valiantly to overcome the material. We love you, Julie, but go back to Sondheim (witness her incredible performance on ""Putting It Together"") next time a round."
2,Could You Stand It!!!?,"What was this? My word. I am so glad that I listened to this before seeing it. I was very disapointed by what I heard. Was this Julie Andrews or some poor animal crying out to be put to sleep?! I hate to say it but I think Julie shoud stick with her holiday special. One of the great up beat numbers from the Film Le Jazz Hot was one of the most boring rewrites I ever heard! Not only was the upbeat dance music turned slow, and boring,but it also shows that Julie's singing days are OVER! My dear we loved you in the movie version, we loved you in Sound of Music, let's keep those meories alive. This one should be put out of print an never let it see the light of day again!!!"
3,Victor/Victoria,"other reviewers of this product have all highlighted that the music and lyrics are not quite up to scratch, and I have to agree. They are by no means of the same callibre as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Kander and Ebb or the great Cole Porter. But, the performers in this show work hard to make sure that the dodgy rhymes work. Especially Rachel York in 'Paris Makes Me Horny'.This CD does nothing for this show. It highlights it's problems but does nothing to prove that it has standing as a true Broadway Show. I would suggest that anyone interested in this item should turn their attention to the DVD version of the full length musical staged at the Marquis Theatre, New York. This DVD shows how good the show actually is - there are moments when you roar with laughter, and you forgive the lack of showstopping numbers.The inimitable Rachel York steals every scene.Not the greatest show in Broadway history, but certainly not the worst."
1,Buy the Movei score instead!,"My titile says it all. But, to elaborate, Julie Andrews, James Garner, Alex Karras were all at their peak. Robert Preston brought such incredible sophisitication and truth as a man living a double life in the spotlight. Finally, few things express the pre-AIDS world freedom as clearly as Leslie Ann Warren's pubic hair showing in high-def. The world has become such a more subdued and censored place since the 70s - early 80s. Why watch or listen to the Broadway re-make of a beautiful moveie when you can get the real thing. Buy the original. Buy the movie and see what we have lost in the past 20 years."
5,Mega!,"Mind you, I am at Granddaddy age, and planning for the numbers gathering, but this is a fabulous grill. Each burner has its own starter/lighter, and you can isolate anywhere on the grill if only using 2 or 3 burners, rather than all 6. Side burner is outstanding. My last grill lasted 20 years. This one .... last one. Wow!"
2,Not for tight turns,"Walthers just modified an existing car rather than focusing on cleaning functionality. The abrasive cleaning pad is too narrow for proper operation if the layout has tight (<20"") turns. In short, a tight turn causes the pad to drop down between the rail resulting in derailing the car as it comes out of the turn."
1,Bad Bad stupid Movie. Almost laughable,"Very surprised to see many think this is a good movie. I just don't see anything worth $15 in this movie. It has a really cheap, rushed feeling. Who the hack write this miserable, uninspiring, stupid script? The director literally rushed the story through, with cheap battles, cheap guns, cheap plots, and some stupid aliens. Totally unbelievable. The movie made both humans and aliens look absolutely stupid. One star is too much for this movie. Don't waste your $$.This is almost the worst movie ever made. Certainly, both the great director and Tom Cruise are at their worst. But whoever picked up this script either wanted to make some cheap money, or ir purely dumb."
1,I wish.....,"I wish Dakotta Fannings character got caught by the aliens so we would never have to hear her scream again.I wish that Speilberg had the rocks to kill off a main character, double so because he made the main character choose and therefore would have to live with these choices.I wish these special effects were used for another, better, movie.I wish that I could have my time back.Save yourself."
1,What a Dissapointment!!,"This movie stinks, sucks, blows (feel free to add your own adjective here). I don't understand how people are giving this 5 stars. Are you watching the same movie? Here are my impressiion of the movies.Good: Impressive Special Effect on some scnes. That is the only good thing I can say about this movie.Bad: No character development at all. No sustaining plot whatsoever. The ""aliens"" are not scary at all. This is nota scary movie...where's the fear factor, the adrenaline rush, the heart-pulsing scene? There are none of that. And this is suppose to be a movie about the end of the world? What a joke.Overall: This movie just didn't connect with me. It didn't feel right. I wasn't entertain in the least bit. Definately didn't live up to the hype. Maybe worth a rental for the special effects."
1,"Big bark, no bite","The special effects were really good and I thought the plot was good at the beginning, but it almost looks like the director threw in the towel after the first hour, and the constant screaming and whining by the character played by Dakota Fanning made the movie almost unwatchable."
5,Great Movie,My family loved it. I highly recommend seeing on a widescreen if you missed it at the theater.
4,"Wow, great remake","I've watched the original and I have to say, this is a pretty good remake of it. Modernized very nicly without taking away from H.G. Wells. Had me thinking about what was going to happen next and putting me in the place of the characters wondering what I would do in their situation and how long I would last, almost unnearving. I have to say, it was a good movie and worthy of ownership."
1,Horrible!,I rather watch the old flick over and over again!Real acting!What really was stupid was that the aliens buried their ships here? When and why? They would of have an easier time when they sent their ships over to earth back then. How come the Earth's governments did not find any of these ships or is the area 51 card going to be played again? This movie was all eye candy but nothing else!And that little brat of an actress screaming all the time through out the entire movie was so annoying!!!
1,How Illiterate Has this Nation Become,"This rating is not for the movie, but for the buffoons who criticized the movie's ending. Amazing! Did they never read H.G. Wells' masterpiece? Did they even know there WAS such a book? Or perhaps, do they even know what a book is?"
2,hilarious.......,".......to read the negative reviews of this movie!There's nothing different I can say here that hasn't been said in the 999 reviews of this movie. Although there are a few things I would like to share in my review.First off, I deeply detest Tom Cruise. I loathe him. And this movie is a Cruise/Spielberg love-fest that was way over-hyped. The oldest son, Robbie, is a wretched nuisance. His character, like Cruise's ruins the movie. He's a spoiled boy who acts entirely too virtuous for his own age. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it has Dakota Fanning in it although I will agree with most of the comments about her bratty, whiny character Rachel. Dakota Fanning has done better so that almost makes the movie not that great unless you love Tom Cruise.The used prices for this movie here on Amazon justify buying it but don't buy it for the insanely over-priced $9.99 used price at your neighborhood video store."
4,fascinating adaption!,"Even with all the reworking, this film still communicates H. G. Wells' Novel's striking element. REALISM. The book makes you think that your reading history. I was glad to hear Spieleburg was making this movie. He has a nak for realism. Some people were complaining about this. It's part of the ORIGIANL CONCEPT. The film is well acted. I love the totally NON-HOLLYWOOD structure and ending. Let's face it, the movie stands out from most Sci-fi action movies these days, because it's capturing the essence of a 19th century classic novel.p.s. kids should be seen and not heard."
1,Very poor quality,"The quality of this Blu-Ray is very poor. In some of the opening scenes when the kids are being dropped off in particular, the white background overtakes the rest of the images almost like the picture has been airbrushed with white. That is the best way I can describe it. I could only watch for about 10 minutes more. The picture is very grainy and the bright backgrounds continued to burst out at you which created a very unnatural look to the picture."
5,Hell Yeah!,"I've never actually seen the first version of War of the Worlds, and I'm pretty thankful of that cuz this version was just wow, took my breath away Completely! LOVED the special effects, made me feel like i was actually there.Extravagent story too, DEFFINATE MUST SEE!"
4,War of the Worlds,"I won't bore you with another blow by blow commentary. That's covered extremely well be others. To summarize, this is a fun, scary movie with some very tense moments. Will it ever make the best 100 movies ever made that has some lasting effect on society or how one lives one's life? No, though I suppose some enterprising soul will find poignant thought-provoking moments here and there. Will I end up buying it despite some ""issues"" raised by others? Yes. After all, it IS a fun, scary movie with some tense moments. Sometimes, I just like to be entertained and this movie fits the bill."
2,Horrible Dialogue Ruin This Movie!!,"Steven Spielberg incorporates elements from H.G. Welles' innovative book written in 1898, Orson Welles' 1939 Radio Broadcast and George Pal's 1953 sci-fi blockbuster. Spielberg did what he had to do to make this film work. Stunning visuals and outstanding special effects almost make this film great. The problem is the screenplay. The dialogue is absolutely dreadful! The characters seemed like they were sleepwalking instead of acting. Throughout the film, I'm convinced of one thing, Tom Cruise is a horrible actor, all looks and no substance. The horrible dialogue in the film will drive you crazy! It did for me!"
3,"Great production, but the script and acting bring it down","I'm a big fan of ""War of The Worlds."" I read the H.G. Wells novel as a kid; I've watched George Pal's 1953 movie version several times, and own Jeff Wayne's 1978 rock opera (a real blast). And, of course, I've listened to the Orson Welles radio broadcast quite a few times as well. So I was really hoping this version would set new standards. It doesn't. The depiction of the alien tripods is terrific, and some of the scenes have real power. Unfortunately, too much of the movie is devoted to intra-family bickering ... and Dakota Fanning's performance is SO annoying that after a while I found myself hoping that the aliens would get her, just so we wouldn't have to listen to her hysterical screaming any more! I'm glad I didn't shell out $16 for two tickets to see it on the big screen!"
3,Not very good for all its hype,"This movie was a major letdown for me, a huge fan of the HG Wells storyNo one has yet to capture the book the way it was intended, and instead all we get are shoddy remakes of the 1953 movie.First off, this movie was predictable and followed the same pattern as the 53 version. It ended too quickly as well, with Speilberg spending too much time worrying about Tom Cruise's characters kids than focusing on the invasion and the aftermath. he tried to end the movie in like 10 minutes and BOOM it was done.Secondly, this story does NOT take place in modern times. It should be late 19th century with us fighting the invaders with steam battleships and artillery and focusing more on the way humanity unravels. heck if this movie was even more like the Jeff Wayne 1970's Rock Opera it would be more acceptableOverall, Spielberg dropped the ball on this one by cashing out and making it a remake of a bad 1953 movie.And the DVD has no footage or anything added that would make it better"
5,War of The Worlds - an incredible Dark Film,"There's not alot that Spielberg has done that I'm not impressed with, and this one is at the top for me. At first glance, a sci-fi movie starrring Tom Cruise paints familiar pictures that we are used to seeing, but upon viewing this is in fact a ""very"" dark movie. The aliens are relentless and the special effects feel too real for comfort. I had seen all the previous versions of this classic tale...which were campy at best to a newer generation. This was an incredible piece of dark cinema painting a reality that all lingers in the back of one's mind. The only complaint I had was when the credits rolled and it was over.... Which motivated me to see it again... One of the more horrific releases that year with or without Tom Cruise.(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
1,What is it about? A horrible mish-mash!,"What a shockingly ill-conceived movie. Here, Cruise is a divorced parent of two not at all precocious children. He gets caught in a war that had been planned by aliens for millions of years. Yawn! And Yawn! His blonde little daughter tries to act the diva and fails miserably, she is awful and relies in pure ham acting but it seems is very popular in USA more for being white and blonde rather than anything else. She is a little lab rat. Cruise is boring and even the machines, which destroy the earthlings act better than the sorry father-daughter duo. The story lacks panache and has absolutely no emotional or entertainment values. Have seen better movies in Hallmark Channel. A big mistake to buy this pure nonsense! The movie moves at a snail's pace and a headache is almost guaranteed!"
2,why?,war of the worlds is speilberg's worst. it's to scary for little kids and it is not cool. the aliens were bad and the blood that was poured out was so fruit punch. tom cruise was horrible at it and dakota fanning was really annong. why did they put miranda otto in second in the end credicts? she wasn't even in this stinki'n movie!
2,Not Spielberg's Best - Not Even Close,"What was Spielberg thinking about when he directed this disaster? I expect an average performance from Cruise and I got it, but Dakota Fanning's considerable talent was wasted. With roles ranging from ""Taken"" to ""Uptown Girls"" to ""Man on Fire"" to her credit, all Spielberg seemed to think she needed to do was put on a blank look and scream. What a waste. Maybe Spielberg was thinking about Munich instead of concentrating on the movie at hand. Too bad."
1,Disappointing,I haven't read the book but the ending of this movie is the worst I have ever seen. You got through a lot of sturm und drang to get nothing at the end. Disappointing.
3,All good til the ending,"I saw this movie when it first came out, the effects and drama wereamazing. The acting was all right, and the audience would focus on the cinematography/visual effects of the movie. I began to think that this was an amazing movie, til I saw the ending. I understand that Steven Spielberg had to follow H.G. Wells' novel, but if it ended like that, why choose to do a movie like that?I think the people in the theater with me would agree, since they were extremely aggravated by the ending. However the overall movie was good."
1,Could have improved,"After sitting through about 30 minutes of the same previews i've seen about 50 times before, the movie finally started. The first 40 minutes seemed to capture an old time, Twilight Zone type feel to it and reeled you in. Then, the movie just fell flat on its face. It had too many speical effects, not enough of a plot/story, and they never devolped any of the characters. Dakota Fanning was annoying and made me hate the movie evening more, the male teenager was cliched, and Tom Cruise could have done better. The movie has good sequences but half way too the end, you start to wonder how will this end? It seems they beat ever possible odd that they could face. The ending was way to fast, and should have been more thought of. If you want to waste money and go see a brainless summer movie, go see this. Batman Begins is still by far one of the best summer movies and will be hard to beat."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE 50s MOVIE.,"Okay, I give it three stars for the special effects alone. Very good; however, too much was unexplained. Why the buried war machines for thousands of years, then return. The aliens destroyed everything, so it couldn't have been to get our infrastructure. Why didn't they just take the planet when they buried the machines? And zapping into the machines in a bolt of lightening....come on! Makes Star Trek's transporters look very realistic in comparison.While not having the technology to produce the effects of today's movies, the 50s version of H.G. Wells' novel is straight forward and explained. One of the best classic science fiction movies ever made. Watch the new one for the special effects, but watch the 50s version for a better plot."
3,Steven Spielberg At His Average,"You know, I like the films of Steven Spielberg. I just prefer the ones with that extra bit of magic (i.e. the Back To The Future trilogy, the Indiana Jones trilogy).This movie has definitely been directed for today's audiences, and in that case, it has accomplished the task. Steven Spielberg has done a great job, as have the actors and crew.War Of The Worlds (2005) is an exciting film and a worthy remake. Worth watching, probably worth buying. I'm just not sure if it's worth remembering."
2,Mediocre and contrived! Cruise is BORING!,"Spielberg's treatment of 'War Of The Worlds' seemed to rely much too much on big Hollywood special effects and Tom Cruise's bland acting (Cruise was a much better and more focused actor in some of his early roles such as in 'Rain Man') in attempting to carry the story. Special effects alone do not a good movie make! Sure the ground cracking open and the tripods looked awesome, but the movie felt more like a comic book rather than a realistic portrayal of what an alien invasion of this magnitude would feel like. The viewer also did not get any information as to who these aliens were. Where are they from? Why are they here? All we essentially know is that these aliens were bent on destruction and bloodshed. We needed MORE of a storyline for the movie to feel complete! The last time I felt this empty and cheated after a performance was when back in the 80's I found out Milli Vanilli lip synched their tunes!"
1,no war in war of the worlds,words can not and i mean can not tell how disappointed i was when i saw this movie in the theather and just like terminator 4 this movie is about a war that has no war. the scene were tom cruise argues with his son while the army fights the aliens is just stupid. I would rather have seen the army fight the aliens but Noooooo we have to watch tom cruise argue with his son. Do not and i mean do not watch this movie and think it is going to be like ID4 or anything like star wars or like the old war of the worlds movie because you will be very very very disappointed.
2,Was Spielberg smoking crack...,"Was Spielberg smoking crack when he made this movie? This was horrible. It was loud (I guess to try and scare people) and boring. Do actors read scripts before they take on roles? Will Dakota Fanning ever stop crying? These are some questions that I hope someone can answer. Now I know why Tom Cruise went nuts after promotong this movie- he got a preview. Horrible acting, horrible script and story. I gave it 2 stars because the tripods weren't that bad."
1,In short...,"I'm going to keep it short. I felt this film was a rehashed production with absolutely no content on any level (save special effects). Spielberg relied on Cruise to pull a weak story with too many inconsistencies and loopholes to count. It felt obvious (to me) that the film tried to leap over pivotal moments in the proceedings to add suspense, when all it added was uncertainty and udder confusion. I was severely disappointed in this movie and I hope Spielberg manages to pull his head from his behind when he decides to pull together another film."
1,One of the worst movies I have seen.,I never expect much from Tom cruise when it comes to great acting. This movie is just another example of the man's terrible acting. A bad story and bad acting = a boring movie. This one is not even worth a rental.
2,"One star for Spielberg, One star for effects","No stars for enjoyment or fulfilling plot. It just ends. After all that. No great battles scenes, no emotional moments between the wooden Tom Cruise and the over-acting Fanning as the annoying daughter - somebody slap the hysterical child.And please tell me why Cruise's ex-wife and her family are miraculously wearing perfectly starched white shirts and suits answering the door of their untouched brownstone? It was ludicrous. There's rubble all around them, but they are pristine. It was just a very sudden ending and not at all satisfying. The son was more of a hero than the father. And the mother Miranda Otto was more memorable than the father's character, played by Cruise. It just didn't click. ET it ain't. Independence Day was a better War of the Worlds in the modern day."
1,did i just buy blu ray?,"I do really like this movie and was really looking forward to watching it in blu ray glory, but what the heck, the quality is worse than the regular dvd!!!!"
1,War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise,I just would like to know if this film is worth purchasing once it comes out on DVD??
2,it's not what i expected!!!,it's not what i expected in this film i recommend people at there to see 1953 film version.take my word for it!!!! this film is not worth.1953 version is.
2,Wow that was...gay.,"If there is a thurder storm outside and your inside you may be bothered. But the people in the movie freak out and dive under a table when theres a storm out side. When the see where the lightning struck outside buildings start to colapes and what do the people do, they stand there and are killed by the aliens. Aliens/Robots are atacking the boats, what do you do get of the boat, but the people get on the boats. The millitary is attacking the aliens/robots, what do you do you run away from the military and aliens/robots, but no people wanna watch.So basiclly everthing was backwards."
1,Simply awful .... a croad of lap,"This supposed blockbuster has cemented in my mind how bad Hollywood can get. A remake which doesn't stay true to the original story, opting more to make it a Tom Cruise vehicle.Tom plays an arrogant father who doesn't talk pleasantly to his children. Not that he can be blamed, the children are annoying throughout. Too much focus on this family unit instead of focusing on what we all wanted to see - aliens! Unfortunately, the alien scenes are few and far between.I am glad I only rented this. My advice to others who are interested in seeing this waste of time is to ask yourself these questions:1. Are you a fan of the annoying arrogant Tom Cruise?2. Do you like silly Hollywood blockbuster movies?3. Do you listen to work colleagues positive reviews of movies?If you answered NO to at least two of these questions, then avoid the film at all costs. Speilberg is losing his touch."
2,Steven are you high???,"Boy oh boy, what a stinker this move is. Seems the media loves Tom Cruise so much, WHY?? with the exception of risky business and minority report, he sure picks bad movies. And The person that wrote this script should be tarred and feathered....Then my dear friends we have the stupidest aliens in the history of the universe. The whole movie all this dysfunctional family wants to do is make it to Boston and BAM!!, they make it to Boston and all the aliens are dying right on cue, when they get there. Steven stick to friendly aliens, you and the bad guys just don't cut it"
2,War of the Worlds,I did not like this movie when I saw it in theaters. The plot was too predictable and the story line in the first place wasn't all that good. I just didn't like the movie.
4,A True Classic,"Excellent acting, excellent special effects, excellent suspence and drama.I truly admire in this version, that Tom Cruise's character tries to protect the innocence of his 10 year old daughter from all the horrors that is going on around them. It was heartwarming.If you want to see a movie that is action pack, this movie will not disappoint."
1,The Biggest Dissapointment in Cinema History.,"When I went to see this movie in the cinema I was so excited. But afterwards I was SO dissapointed. Possibly Speilbergs worst film and Cruise's worst performance. Totally dreadful acting and even worse directing. Everything seems backwards in this film as tence scenes end awkwardly. Tom Cruise constantly shouting out kids names and Dakota 'The Fanny' Fanning screaming to really annoying effect.A terrible, terrible remake. H.G. Wells would be turning in his grave."
4,Another Delight From Steven Spielberg,"War of the Worlds has been told in countless ways. From the radio to other film versions. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise take their stab at it and it does not disappoint.Action packed from the beginning War of the Worlds is a delight to ears and eyes. The story is good although a few plot holes keeps it from being great.Tom Cruise plays Ray, a single father who has to watch his children while his wife and her new husband are away. While he's watching them Aliens invade the town, now, it's a father trying to protect his children from forces he's not even sure of.A delightful movie to watch.Definitely recommended. The Two Disc set is absolutely phenomenal. Worth a definite checking out."
1,Horrible Quality,I assumed that the quality would be good because it was a DVD but I was wrong. The picture was grainy and not very clear. This is the only DVD I have that plays like this. The movie itself is great.
5,The best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best th heat ray the violence, this is a cool movie the aliens look realistic. Trust me you won't be mad."
2,How long were they waiting down there?,Steven Spielberg took an old movie with a fairly believable story and made his remake utterly unbelievable. Here is the start of Cruise's character experiencing the aliens for the first time. The Martians had their tripod war machines waiting in the ground for thousands of years and they just happen to end up under the city that was built much later. What? Duh. It pretty much ruined the movie for me. All Spielberg wanted was to show how great he could master the special effects of the streets ripping up and use dolby sound to enhance the effects. TOTAL AND AWFUL CONTRIVING ON HIS PART. It really hurt my ability to accept the movie. Sometimes an excellent old movie is better left alone no matter how much a director wants show his knack for special effects.
1,SHOULD BE CALLED WAR OF THE DISASTERS,"first off let me make it perfectly clear i am a steven spielberg fan,but i must say his vision of the war of the worlds was not good at all.the tripods and aliens were ok but the story line could have been better.i find dakota fanning annoying throughout the movie with her constant screaming.tom cruise was ok but the story line was focused on him and his kids and not on the invasion.at least in the george pal version we do see the army fight the alien ships,on spielbergs movie we only see a little army fighting with aliens at the end of the movie.the worst part of the movie was the army and alien fight in the middle of the movie where as we dont see a fight at all!!!!!,what a big dissapointment!this is nothing more than a quick buck remaking a classic.if you truly want to see the war of the worlds as it was meant to be seen see the original 1953 george pal's war of the worlds.this remake is what i consider see only once and forget about it........."
2,Not so good..,"A typical product for DVD...It's not a bad movie, but it's not even close to greatness. The kids were really annoying, Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise (as always).. bah, I don't know..."
4,Entertaining movie...,"This was a good movie that I enjoyed better than the original. Speilberg did a great job with this and Tom Cruise did a job well done also. It had a couple of parts that I questioned but all in all I enjoyed this movie. The aliens were very cool and this movie was shot very well. I overall enjoyed this movie, and although I never liked the ending to this story, I still enjoyed this movie a lot."
3,War Of The Worlds,I have not watched this DVD yet! I am disappointed with the packaging or the lack of it. There was no inserts particularly the chapter layout. This seems to be a trend with all the recent movie purchases.I did see the movie in the theatre and I did not like all the screaming that Dakota did. The plot runs pretty much to what HG Wells wrote.
1,What's The First Thing You Would Do?,"First of all, let me correct an earlier (deleted)review in which I stated this movie did not have ""CC"", close captioning. Even though the box does not mention it (for whatever weird reason), this movie does have it.Now, as to the movie. So what would you do if you had just fled for your life, having just seen something horrible and deadly, you made it to a house with electricity and possible phone service; so what would you do? I'd turn on the TV or radio to try and find out what I just saw! I sure wouldn't go make peanut butter sandwiches!Tom Cruise was the wrong man for this movie. Sorry. A 40 year old Mel Gibson would have been great, or maybe Harrison Ford.The script was poor, with many puzzling comments. And how did these martians survive on Mars with no human blood?The best part was the end were you saw Gene Barry and Ann Robinson from the original (and better, MUCH better) film."
2,Great special effects -- thin on story = mediocre movie.,"Great special effects...but after an 1 and 1/2 of it it gets tiresome. Somehow the original was more engaging and terrifying.The characters are flat and it is very difficult to feel empathetic or ""connected"" to any of the characters. It is an hour and a half of effect and react -- effect and react. Okay okay Mr. Spielberg we get it. Spielberg's 20+ year of first extra terrestrial effort ET though not really terrifying is simply much better story telling."
1,Tom Cruise at his worst.,"This version of War of the Worlds is one of the worst science fiction genre movies that I have had the displeasure of sitting through.I was surprised that given all the hype, it turned to be very poorly conceived.Tom Cruise was the wrong ""hero"" for this classic story."
