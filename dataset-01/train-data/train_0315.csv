3,Not their best - but a really good album,"Having just had front row seats for their Exciter tour and listened to this album shortly before, let me tell you Depeche Mode still knows how to make awesome music.Exciter is what we've come to expect from DM, but it doesn't deliver the expected... It's really good tunes, without rehashing old stuff. It's new without being too new.You'll like this if you like DM."
4,"Pretty good, but lacks","Depeche Mode's music career is quite long. It's quite surprsing to find a band that can stay together for about 20 years and still make good music. Though this is definitely not DMs best album, it's a good one. Some of the strongest tracks are I Feel Loved, When The Body Speaks, and Shine. Breathe is pretty good and Dream On is not as great as I thought it would be. Freelove's not bad and Comatose is okay. I would have to say that Exciter breaks away from the darker image given from their older albums and personally I prefer this one over Ultra. However, I doubt this album can be placed in the top with both Music for the Masses or Violator. One good thing is that incoporates the elctronic sound that some fans may miss about the original DM."
5,A more mature sound.,"I didn't listen much to this album, although I've owned it for a long time, until only recently after seeing Depeche Mode live in a concert (Playing The Angel) where they played quite a few songs from this album.This album has a more mature tone. There are more references to love. In my younger days, I was the drifter type, depressed teen that loved grunge and a little bit of Snoop. But I've grown up, found love and become what many other Gen-Xers have become eventually.The best songs for me are Goodnight Lovers, Free Love and Dream on. It's a refreshing album, a nice break from all the other ones, although I love all the other albums too."
4,exciter excites me,"i'm not even old enough to have listened to their first stuff, but this cd has me wondering what it would be like, to talk to all your friends about depeche mode and they'd be all 'man, they're the coolest! i'm actually going to their show later this month!'nope, none of my friends are culured enough to realise the neatness of these guys.'dream on' is the first, and coolest song on here...or maybe 'shine' is...i lie...all of them are very, very good.if you're into moby and new-agey stuff, buy this cd along with all their others, (and some moby stuff too!)depeche mode has a new fan.ME"
2,I am being fair...,"Only two stars? I set my standards very high when it is DM concerned. They didn't deliver this time...it is, quite frankly, a boring cd. Almost all songs are slowly paced, which is not always bad. But they are, and that is a real shame, uninspired written songs. I Feel Love, Shine On are exceptions to the rule and it's no surprise that these song were chosen as a single. And of course there are some good songs on this cd, hey this is DM! But listening to the whole cd in one time is hard because of the consistency (meaning:dull) throughout which in this case is not a good thing. A real shame, I was never dissappointed by DM. Well there is a first time for everything I guess. Conclusion: singles from this cd are good (not great). Overall impression though is poor."
4,excited,"i almost didn't pick this up along with the weezer and rem releases today, due largely to Spin and Rolling Stone's poor reviews, but I am very glad I broke free of their influence. Exciter is not just a pointless rehash of old sentiments, as Spin said, but nothing but new depeche mode that sounds just as great as classic and beautiful depeche mode. they have not lost any edge, but in growing up have lost the connection to teenage melancholia but! still know what gets their fans going. like the Cure, they are the same men, just older more reflective and more innovative. and as an added bonus, Exciter rocks much harder than Ultra."
4,Exciter?,"As usual Depeche Mode kept us waiting for their latest album. The problem in the 90s was that the best things didn't always come to those who wait. I think however that the quality we were all used to in the 80s has returned albeit not the style. This new album, while high on quality is decidely low on adrenaline. Take ""Violator"" and slow it down by 50 BPMs, insert some Jazz and Trance influences and you will have an approximation of this newest DM ofering. Fans of songs such as ""The Sweetest Perfection"" or ""Dangerous"" will really appreciate this album. Those longing for a rehash of ""Strangelove"" or ""Enjoy the Silence"" will probably be disappointed. In a word: mellow."
4,Exciter: Not too Exciting,"As a DM fan for more than 25 years, I can say that with Exciter the guys missed the mark with this album. It's a decent album but to me it seemed a bit over produced. Perfect example is Freelove. Seven years after this was released I can barely stand to listen to that track when I play the album.However there are some great tracks here: Dream On; I Feel Loved (great dance track); The Dead of Night, a great grungy, industrial track that reminds you of their old stuff and finally Goodnight Lovers, a song that almost sounds like a lullaby.Dave's voice never sounded better but I thought some of the songs could have been stronger. Playing the Angel - the follow-up to this album was a much stronger record.Again, not a bad album but not among DM's best."
2,Ultra II,"I've been waiting 14 years for dm to release a good album. I'm still waiting! After the drab Ultra, I was eagerly anticipating Exiter. What I got was Ultra II. The songs here, with the exception of one or two, lack the energy of dm's early-mid 80's material... I hate it when bands change just for the sake of changing. Some ""music experts"" call it ""maturing"". I call it starting to suck! I gave this 2 stars because, while it's beneath dm's standards, it's still better than 99% of the new stuff out the market today. To explain dm's current affliction, look no further than track no. 8 on this cd (Comatose)."
5,Reach Out and Touch Faith,"The opening track of Exciter is very reminiscent to Personal Jesus. With this new CD we see a return to the classic Depeche Mode from Music for the Masses and Violator. Most importantly, Exciter was made with he heart and soul of the entire band. Martin put the life experience of the band into this album. This is a great new CD to add to your collection, and it is a MUST have for any Depeche Mode fan."
1,EXCITER IS ANYTHING BUT...,"First off, I think Depeche Mode is great. I love mostly all of the albums. They each have there own unique quality and sound that makes them unique. I had a hard time dealing with Ultra at first, but then it eventually grew on me. I unfortunately can not say the same for Exciter, which came out less then 24 hours ago. I know eveyone will say I'll probably grow into this one too and that I'm jumping the gun, but personallly I don't think I am. I have tickets to the show in New York and look forward to hearing the old favorites any Depeche Mode fan has grown to love and call there own. I guess when Dave or Martin starts to bellow out one of the choir tunes from Exciter, which the exception of ""Shine"" and ""I Feel Loved"", I guess it will be time for me to go to the bathroom... or perhaps even better... get an early jump on that beer line so I can enjoy old school DM during the encores. Bottom line, doen't waste your money on this one, but don't miss the tour this summer..."
3,Not so bad but could be better,"I know Depeche Mode has had its problems and from the sound of the CD is sounds positive. However, not many songs cut the track in my book. I have been a Depeche Mode fan for a long time. However, in this case I have been somewhat dissapointed in the songs they produced for this CD. The songs towards the end of the CD are nothing more than a ""space waster"". If you liked some of the songs from the ""Love & Devotion"" CD, then you will be disappointed. If you liked the ""Ultra"" CD then you may like this one."
2,exciter,"i loved there ultra album this album has some beautiful poems but lacks the energy of ultra it doesn't rock! ok, some tracks are moving and his voice is great but it doesn't stand out saying i want here that again except for maybe ""i feel loved"" with the trance/techno explosion going on and them being the grandaddies of some techno sounds they could of sold more albums with some more techno/trance sounding tunes maybe that isn't what they wanted anyway maybe its will grow on me? i know Martin gore has suffered to be able to write such lyrics don't worry it all about growing and some times it hurts as you say like all soul sisters/brothers bruce gilling"
3,Far behind ULTRA,"This album was a kind of disappointing to me. I liked too much ULTRA, and Exiter contains only 2 good songs to me. However, if you did not like Ultra, this could be a good album for you. I hope DM will release in the future albums closer to Ultra."
2,Not Exciting...,"As a long-time Mode fan I have 2 main problems with this album: 1) Way too minimal in presentation. DM is a band meant for lush sound & deep production and the tiny blips, bleeps & squeeks on here do them absolutely no justice. 2) Let's be honest about the instrumentals, Andy & Martin aren't playing and Dave isn't singing. What we have is a musical piece written by Gore and interpreted by The Producer. They aren't really ""Depeche tracks"".Overall though, the songwriting is still strong and I can only ""Dream On"" about what this album could have sounded like."
1,EXCITER IS NON-EXCITING,"Depeche Modes latest effort ""Exciter"" is just awful. The album from beginning to end is absolutely slow dribble.No hooks or standout songs like ""Strangelove"", ""People Are People"", ""Master or Servant"", just dribble.The production is good, but the energy of this album is so low that you feel it is the end of the world for this band.""Dream On"" the first single which right now is a hit on Billboards Club Play chart do to thankfully being remixed to a faster upbeat song is one of the worst songs I have ever heard from Depeche Mode.The rest of the album is just as bad with depressing songs ""Shine"", ""When the Body Speaks"", ""Breathe"" and the ever suicidal ""I Am You"".If anything I am now officially over Depeche Mode who I feel peaked in 1989 with ""Personal Jesus"".A total disappointment."
3,Don't believe the Hype - not worth the $$$,"This is NOT the best Depeche Mode album made, if you want the best get the Violator album. The band tries to go in too many different directions on this album. While ""Dream On"" is a throw to classic Depeche Mode, most of the album is annoying at best. Luckily, I got this album as a gift and didn't spend my own cash on it. The album my grow on you after a few plays, but my initial left me with the idea that the DM boys are washed up and out of ideas. I definitely will NOT be attending their concert after hearing this album even though I am a huge fan. Sorry, guys but keep trying and wait until the WHOLE album is at the level of ""Dream On"". So, in closing save your money and get the single of ""Dream On"" because you might be dreaming onto their next album in hopes that its better than this one like me."
5,The least I expected from the band,"After an excellent work such as 'Ultra' this was the least I could expect from the band. My first impressions about the album were very positive.In order to contrast it with the previous album, it has to be said that this one, except for a couple of songs, sounds like a more quiet and perhaps mature Depeche.I'm definitely going to miss being able to see them when they come to town... but I'm not gonna be around! :("
3,a mixed bag,"Unlike some of the other ""Exciter"" reviewers I adored their last CD ""Ultra."" I thought it was honest, interesting and extremely solid, ""Exciter"" however, is fairly dull. Like other reviewers have pointed out, much of the album is very slow in tempo with just ""I Feel Loved"" and ""Dream On"" picking up the pace a bit. Not that I am saying a slow tempo makes for a bad album, but it does get a bit boring after awhile. I like a little variety. My other problem with this CD is the cheesey lyrics. Song after song deals with (presumably) Martin's love life (which seems to have improved 'cause he's all gushy). After awhile, I was sick of ""sharing our freelove"" as Dave softly sings on the track ""Freelove."" I am disappointed that they seem to have lost the edge that made them the best in dark electronic."
2,A week of trying ....,"I've had the album for well over a week at this point and I've listened to it constantly in an attempt to find that redeeming aspect that all Depeche Mode albums have had for me. Unfortunately, this one doesn't have it. An album where nearly all of the songs sound derivative, albeit with better production, of the more forgettable songs from past albums like the last half of 'Ultra', 'Get Right With me' from SOFAD, and 'Blue Dress' and 'Waiting For The Night to Fall' from 'Violator', 'Exciter' left the excitement somewhere else."
5,Excelent Exciter!!,"I'd just like to say to all that boring people trapped in the eighties, taht are rating this album with one star that why don't, in that case, keep buying cd's from back street boys, or maybe limp bizkit perhaps, no, wait aerosmith??? well something like that, poor people, you all used to be fans from depeche mode. Just try to look forward another kind of music, that's my advice...... To all the rest of the people, this album is very good, excelent sounds, songwritting and voices......... buy it!!!, after violator, Exciter is their second best album...."
1,"Derivative, Tired.","Save your money. Depeche Mode is just going through the motions here. There's nothing really innovative here, nothing ""experimental"" about any of the lyrics, despite the editor's review listed above. As a matter of fact, the tiresome AA/BB rhyme scheme will probably drive you slowly insane. You know: ""I had a CAR, I went to a BAR, I had a nice DRINK, washed my hands in the SINK"" so on and so forth. The music is nothing special either: there's a track that is so close to Iggy Pop's ""Nightclubbing"", you'll think that you mixed up the discs in your changer. Now, I'm a big fan of these guys, but why keep anyone in Sacred Cow status? When music is bad, it's bad, regardless of who did it. Don't let your devotion to what these guys were (as recently as a couple of years ago) deafen you to what they have become. Save your money, or buy this one REALLY CHEAP on auction."
2,Comatose...............Almost,"This album sounds too much like Martin Gore's Counterfeit E.P. Too slow and too experimental.I thought Ultra was excellent - this album, while aspiring for lofty heights with it's slick production, divebombs and explodes. I consider myself a true DM fan, so I will give it 2 stars."
3,Not the same Depeche mode,"I would not say that this is a bad album, but I find it to be rather a disappointment. The dark quick electronic beats which I was used to hearing has been replaced by a lighter more upbeat acoustical sound. I don't mean to say ""Don't buy this Album"" but I will say to listen to it before buying if you can, because it is NOT the same Depeche Mode that you have known in the past."
5,5 STARS!!!!!,"REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANYONE HERE SAYS THIS ALBUM/CD IS A DEPECHE MODE TRIUMPH!!! IT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING TO ME WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO A BANDS OLD STYLE AS IF BANDS SHOULD ALWAYS STAY THE SAME AND NOT ""GROW/EVOLVE"" THIS ALBUM IS MIDLY DIFFERENT AT BEST. SOME PEOPLE JUST CANNOT ""STOP LIVING IN THE PAST!!!!!"" AND WITH THAT, LET THE MUSIC PLAY!!!!"
1,"Just couldn't get ""excited"" about this one!","Like many other reviewers, I just thought this album was one big bore. I fail to see how they could give this album such a name that suggests happy, bouncy tunes ala ""Just Can't Get Enough."" Picture ""Question of Lust""- type songs filling an entire album and you will be bored stiff if you're not asleep by the end. Too many downbeat slow songs on one album and you've got a good cure for insomnia. Their recent music has proven they can still produce good tunes (Violator is my all-time favorite, and Songs of Faith and Devotion was pretty good) but this was a real ""miss."" While I hope it's not the death of Depeche it certainly sounds like something reminiscent of a funeral dirge. One star, however, for the nice photo of the band. They haven't changed a whole lotIf you must have this album, do yourself a favor and check it out from the library or borrow from a friend first before investing the money."
2,Please tell it like it is! <Exciter or Borer?>,"I do consider myself a hardcore depeche mode fan, but I will not defend something that clearly should not be defended. Exciter my [butt], this album should be called Borer. The only tracks on this cd worth listening to are ""Dream On"", ""Shine"" and ""Freelove"", the rest is simply boring and uninspired noise. Regardless of this fact, I will still be attending the concert in June 2001. Hopefully they will play mostly their old stuff, b/c i didn't pay money to see a band sing terrible songs.Peace Out!"
3,altogether a very strong album,"i came into the ""depeche mode"" a little late...actually truly late...ultra is my first and only album i own from them...i purchased ""exciter"" yesterday because i liked the idea of them working with mark bell...who did a brilliant job co-producing on bjork's ""homogenic"" album...although mark bell doesn't get any where near as futuristic or visionary as his previous work does...he does do a great job of ""window dressing"" some good rock songs from an altogether good rock band. this album continues the dark and moody feel of their previous works and adds a touch of modernism and hope to it. standout tracks include ""when the body speaks"" and ""freelove"". get this album if you are a depeche mode fan or a lover of that dark, german, rock vibe. good stuff. : )"
4,Exciter Will Excite!!,"May 14th, and yes I had to buy the CD as soon as it came out. The album is very minimalistic, moody and dark at times. Then ""I Feel Loved"" just booms out of nowhere with a nice beat (future single perhaps?) and would be perfect for the danceclub and MTV (show the viewers who Daft Punk, MOBY and Fatboy Slim got thier sound from....) This track is fantastic and I can picture the crowd hopping up and down during the concert tour this summer...I love the dark, spy-theme-like subtle guitar on ""Breathe"" and some of the other tracks (DM should do the next Bond theme).Overall, a great album with some new direction that fits very well within thier discography. Fans who wanted another ""Enjoy The Silence"" or ""Everything Counts"" may take awhile to get used to it, but the album will not disappoint....."
2,#2 helpful hint,"I am ranked very high among Depeche Mode fanatacism...I simply love most of their stuff. At one time, before this album, I would have said ""I simply love ALL of their stuff!"". This release was simply a let down. Sure, there are some good songs - in fact, they are all ""good""...but they're simply not DM...more like solo MLGore w/ Gahan singing. I am simply shocked, I am...I hope their next one (2005-2006) will be more like Ultra, or whatever Exciter simply SHOULD have been! (this is helpful hint #2. For helpful hint #1, see my review of Ultra).Even as a hardcore DM fan (yes, hardcore), I'm gonna have to veto this one. Save your hard earned cash, and buy something like Ultra or Violator or SOFAD or...simply, you get the idea..."
3,"It's a great start for Microsoft, but still needs some work.","Microsofts attempt to move into the market dominated by QuickBooks seems like a patch job to try and cover the gap between MS Money users and Great Pains ... um, Great Plains users. Users of MS Money will find that there is no way to import the transactions from Money to SBA. New users are recommended to convert to SBA at the beginning of their fiscal year. Users of QuickBooks will find the UI to be very similar to QB, almost too similar. Also, the list of banks that you can download statements online seems to be limited to regional banks. If you have an account with a bank with a national presence, such as Bank of America or Chase, you're out of luck for now. There is a noticable delay when posting items, and the system seems to become unstable at times. In a single day our office has had it crash 3 times."
1,Never worked for me,"I registered for the trial version and downloaded the 106MB file. It installed fine, but when I tried to start the program, it threw an exception right after the splash screen. I submitted the report so hopefully someone can fix it.I tried this on Windows 2000, 1GB RAM, 2.6Ghz P4, Office 2003 Pro.I really don't like going back to Quickbooks Pro 2006, but I really don't have any choice."
2,Not quite mature yet - someday maybe,"I was rather unimpressed by the Microsoft SBA, and have decided to return it to MS. It does not allow shipping weights on items!? All of the Add-ins that people on here are raving about, are far more expensive than you can get elseware if you look around. It seems that MS needs to make a commitment to this software to make it better than the rest, or it is just another MS app for MS fans. Microsoft programmers will love it, as will people with a high level of MS office integration on hand, as the import/export to excel is nice. Retailers can find better solutions if they look for them. We have decided to go with sql-ledger instead, its 20 times faster on the same machine, integrates with our website with the same amount of programming, and free for unlimited users!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I ordered the Trial version directly from Microsoft. What a horrible piece of software. It was VERY slow and the ability to customize is nil. Online help was awful. I had to ""end task"" just to close out. Stay away!"
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,Does not have the flexibility (espicially with forms) that QB has. It also does not have a global mark-up option. Maybe next year.
1,Avoid this bug infested application,"I purchased this application, and spent two weeks getting my business set up. During this time, SBA repeatedly hung, requiring shutdown from the Program Manager. After spending 10 hours downloading updates on a dial up connection, SBA hung up the computer so badly I had to shut down with the power switch. After removing the upgraded version, and re-installing the original SBA, I discovered that SBA had converted all my company data to an incompatible version. At this point, I trashed the CD in disgust, removed SBA, and spent the afternoon bringing my old version of Peachtree Complete back up to date. Save yourself this hassle, and don't buy SBA. It's cheap for a reason, but not cheap enough."
2,go get QuickBook Pro instead,"I bought this software for $60 AR months ago, I thought it's a great deal comparing to Quickbook Pro. But it's a total disapointment, it's not user friendly in most of the cases, I had no idea how it worked. So I had to buy QuickBook Pro for $150 instead from Costco, therefore I end up pay more by choosing a wrong product in the begining (trying to be cheap too). I like Microsoft products in general, but this just doesn't cut it, it's a long way to go. I had little problem using Quickbook, maybe I've used Turbotax for years. Just my $0.02."
4,Great small business accounting software - needs more reports,"Overall I really like this software and would recommend it. It was easy to install and begin using. You must get Service Pack 2 in order to run manual payroll (if you don't want to connect up with ADP). The backup function is easy to use and very helpful as it prompts you periodically. There appears to be a lot of functionality that I have not yet tapped into. The reports in the software are adequate, but there needs to be many more around payroll and employees. I've not found a report for printing earnings statements or paystubs."
1,Did Not Receive Shipment,"I had sent for this item in August, and had moved from that address. Unfortunately, the postal service did not forward my package to my new address, therefore, I am unable to give a proper review of this item."
5,Working just fine,Worked as expected right out of the package. Good fit and good battery life so far.
2,your data will be lost,"easy to use, easy to install. However, a year and a half into use, the drive failed on me and my data is history. While just one man's experience, troubleshooting the problem has led me to a horde of unsatisfied fantom users who experience hardware failure at about the 2 year mark. When it comes to protecting your data, don't be cheap.- Dan"
3,It's okay.,I expected more drama from the title. It is an awesome story just not very well told. Grateful they allowed him to leave the mafia.
2,Read the fine print,"Don't be fooled by the picture-this key rack is white. This is stated in the description, but the picture makes it look like it is steel or silver. It's really a cheap, plastic white material."
4,good acept for an exit glitch,"I see the game more about skill than racing. Your choice of character and how you use each character determins who wins. Your skill determins your speed. In my opinion it is more racing and stratagy than Mario Cart, and it has Sonic The Hedgehog and friends, who can beat that.One glitch I noticed about the game was that in the full screen mode there is no way to exit the game. In window mode you can close the game by clicking on the X in the top right hand corner of the window, but in the full screen mode you have to press Alt F4 to exit."
5,better than sonic unleashed,"it is so awesome ,I like it as much as sonic riders zero gravity,sonic zero riders and sonic unleashed but only game that is the best is sonic and the black knight."
4,Great Game! Launcher Issues!,"Whenever I tried to run Sonic Riders I would get a message saying it must be run from the launcher - and even if I ran it from the launcher it would not run. In other words, the game installs fine, but refuses to run. The fix is to go to the Sega web site and down load the updated launcher file and replace the old file. Then the game will launch correctly. Other than this issue my son loves the game."
1,The New Danny Davis & The Nashville Brass: Christmas Album,"This is not the original Danny Davis Christmas album from the seventies, but rather a ""new"" release of the original songs. It does not have the musician ship found on the earlier release. I found ""Blue Christmas"" to be a prime example of this. I would not recommend this CD. Find an original LP record from the seventies and put it on CD format if your a Nashville Brass ""Purest"" like myself."
4,Great sound,"I have this receiver hooked up to my HDDVR, DVD, and an Xbox 360 on a 5.1 speaker system. I thought the receiver looked good.Figuring it out wasn't the easiest, but it's also not incomprehensible.I get great Dolby Digitial sound and it automatically changes to Prologic when not recieving Dolby5.1 from the non-HD stations.The autosetup was great.Cons:No HDMI, but unless you're willing to pay > 1k or wait a few years, it's not worth buying any of the mid-range recievers with HDMI out right now. Most either only do video passthrough, or don't handle it as they should.No on screen GUI menu"
4,The characters come to life!,"Kat Vargas is a private investigator recovering from a gunshot wound, complements of another case. While recuperating, she house-sits for Jake and Carly Montgomery. The town she ""relaxes"" in is Twilight Cove, California, and Kat Gets bored quickly. Twilight Cove is just TOO peaceful for her. So when Ty shows up needing her help, she agrees.Ty Chandler had not known he was a father. He only recently learned he has a daughter, a nineteen-year-old daughter, Sunny. He hires Kat to locate her. It turns out that finding Sunny is easy, however, nothing else is.**** Author Jill Marie Landis has created a wonderful story that her fans will RUN to get their hands on. Once again the characters seem to leap off the pages and into the hearts of the readers. Recommended! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
5,Jill Marie Landis's best yet,"I've been a fan of Jill's for years, and I was apprehensive when I heard she was writing contemporary instead of historical fiction. Lover's Lane changed my mind--great character development and excellent writing transcend genre. Heat Wave fulfills the promise of Lover's Lane. (If you haven't read them both, you should.)"
5,Great page turner!,"Not only was this a great love story, but it surprised me by being full of suspense. I did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. I highly recommend it!"
4,An Entertaining Read,"I was hesistant on buying this book, but took the plunge. If for nothing else, it kept me laughing!! The gentleman who wrote it must have a great sense of humor. I liked the story, some of the characters and it was very well written. The way the book ended lends me to believe there will be a sequel (or at least I hope there will be). I'd like to see what happens between Sahara and Jean-Paul."
3,Good Value,I had a coupon for this so it was a good value. Otherwise it is to expense for what you get. My box had a couple of opened cereals in it so I didn't get the full value of all...
5,Great Product,"After reading other reviews I was hesitant to order the cereal, but after receiving it was glad I did. It's true that the varieties are not equally divided in the order, but I still received an adequate amount of each. It's so nice not having to wash another bowl and there's a nice choice waiting in the morning without having to worry if the cereal has gone stale because the lid was left open."
4,The one box that we all like,This is the only box of cereal that has choices for all 6 of us. Don't forget to recycle the plastic bowls!
1,Dangerous,As long as Kellogg's uses GMOs this product is just too dangerous to consume. The corn used has been proven to disrupt major organs of the body. Other studies show a corrolation with impotency and decreased sex drive. No study has determined long term health hazards.
4,Needs more variety,"This is a fairly decent package with an uneven distribution. Instead of receiving 10 cups of each product as one might anticipate, the box has twice the number of cups of Frosted Flakes and about six cups of Cocoa Puffs. Unfortunately, the Raisin Bran Crunch is the spoiler in this package. The raisins are tough, difficult to chew, and lay on the bottom of the cup so don't expect to find any raisins until the cereal is just about gone."
1,Wrong order,"We ordered the Favorite Assortment Pack, but that is not what we received. When we questioned our order, we were told they were out of stock on our original order, and we could not return the order we received. We won't order again."
2,Portions too big!,"Great Kellogg's cereal, all our favorites, but the portions per cup are way too big for any of us - we'd do better with about half the size."
1,NO STARS!,"I used to be a dedicated customer of Kellogg's...then I started educating myself in nutrition, agriculture, and health. Why doesn't Kellogg's USA properly label their plethora of ""food"" products as containing genetically engineered ingredients? They have no problem manufacturing non-GMO cereals for other countries, and label appropriately those which do contain it. I own a small food manufacturing company, myself, and I am proud to be able to label ALL of my ingredients as non-GMO and organic. (It doesn't cost a dime!) I am a diligent label reader, and I vote with my dollars! My friends and family do the same. We can win this, folks! Peace."
3,"Worth a purchase, I suppose.","Frosted Flakes - Classic, and just sweet enough to get you through... 4.25 stars.Pops - Another classic cereal, but rarely liked. Gross to me, good to some. 1 star.Fruit Loops - Newer than the others. Mildly enjoyable. 3 stars.Raisin Bran Crunch - Good, newer than others. 3.75 stars.Cocoa Crispies - Gross to me, but another classic cereal. Reese's Puff beats the PANTS off of these! 2 stars.Apple Jacks - Classic, new green Jack, addictive. 4 stars.A decent package all together. Not without its faults.3 stars."
3,"Good purchase, but beware of broken seals.","I ordered the Kellogg's Cereal Variety Pack because I figured I might be able to save a few bucks compared to buying regular boxes of cereal that typically end up going stale when there's enough left for 3-4 bowls.The big box arrived (trust me, it's huge), and one of the first things I noticed when I picked it up was the sound of cereal rattling around inside. Immediately I suspected that one of the cereal cups may have broke, but I never expected to find that 15 of the cups had broken seals - because of this, a lot of cereal was spilled inside the shipping box, plus I ended up throwing away the bad cups which meant my pack of 60 turned into a pack of 45.So buyer beware - while this is a decent bargain if you're looking to save some money, you might get a box that contains cups with broken seals."

4,Great Sugar Cereal,"I bought this cereal assortment instead of the ""Wellness Assortment"" to try something different. The ""Wellness Assortment"" is alot better, however totally different cereals.There are very few ""Fruit Loops"" but plenty of ""Frosted Flakes"" in this assortment. None of the cereals have any protein or fiber, ok maybe 1 gram. I was hungry an hour later after eating this stuff. Although, Pops, Fruit Loops, and Apple Jacks taste awesome. They're a great replacement to greasy potato chips or fatty ice cream.The ""Wellness Assortment"" has alot more protein and fiber, and also tastes great. On the other hand it has a lot of Special K cereal, some have ""red berries"" (stawberries) though.Leave this sugar cereal to the kids (or keep as a snack) and get the ""Wellness Assortment"" for yourself. It may cost a little more but it's worth it."
2,Unwanted surprises,The product picture shows 7 different cereals and the description only 6. We did get all 7 and unfortunately we also go 6 boxes of Crave as part of 60 which we absolutely did not want. We also had two units that had popped open with the cereal spread in the box. The good news is that customer support prorated a reduction in our price to remove the items we did not request and the damaged item. Maybe the stars should be higher since they got about 80% of the order correct and that is all we ended up paying for. I just really don't like surprises and getting 8 different cereals when we only ordered 6 was definitely a surprise.
2,Agatha nominee left me flat,"After being pretty impressed with recent Agatha first book nominees, I've been venturing back into some of the older nominees. This book, a nominee in 1991, wasn't very impressive. The story is set in a B&B in a small town in Tennessee. Far too much of the book is about the B&B and small town life. Such mystery as there is only gets rolling in the second half of the book. It seemed to me that the author's real agenda was to write about life in her town and the mystery was an afterthought.Bottom-line: Not sure what this book did to earn a nomination and not surprised the series hasn't gone on to further critical acclaim. There's better southern small town mystery out there (Margaret Maron, Carolyn Hart and others)."
4,Shine,"I had seen this movie before I purchased it,this was an excellent movie and had wanted to add it to my collection for some time now.Everything about the order I placed was as promised and have not had any problems using Amazon.com"
2,Not enough material is provided,"This VHS tape cassette is a nice introduction to Square Dancing but although 65 mainstream moves are mentioned in the description, a very few are actually covered. We expected much more. There certainly was enough room for more tape on the cassette to instruct many more moves and for the price, it should have been there."
5,Great shampoo for fine hair with oily tendencies,"This is a wonderful shampoo for my hair type. I have long, fine hair that tends to be oily. I use this shampoo first and Nexxus Simply Silver or Platinum Pro second. Using the Tea Tree shampoo first removes all hair product and leaves my hair very clean. The second shampoo with Nexxus tones my blonde hair and softens it a bit (Tea Tree Shampoo does have a clarifying effect, so the suggestion about using a deep conditioner afterwards is a good one if you have dry, color treated or damaged hair...either that or do as I do and use a more gentle shampoo after). Also the strong minty/eucalyptus fragrance isn't for everyone. I personally like it but if you're wanting a more floral, citrus or neutral scent, you probably won't like this product."
4,great shampoo,"This a great shampoo, my hair dresser used it on me and I found it refreshing and it made my hair feel clean and I immediately asked her what she was using and she said "" Tea Tree by Paul Mitchell"". I used it in combination with my detangler shampoo."
5,Great product with greaat scent,My dermatologist recomended this shampoo foor me because I was loosing hair after I had a surgery. It solved my problem and also has a great scent and refreshing sensation. I think I will always use it! My hair has never been better!
4,Shampoo for the oil of hair,"My beautician told me that since my hair tends towards the oily side, I needed to look into getting tea tree oil shampoo. I searched everywhere and it was REALLY expensive for a small amount- but then I went to amazon. I found a huge bottle of shampoo for a reasonable amount. The only thing I would caution towards is the shipping price. It was pretty expensive, since it didn't come directly from amazon. However, the shampoo came very quickly and was in excellent condition...and it works great on my hair!"
1,I am a Paul Mitchell stylist...,"Hello, I am a Paul Mitchell trained stylist... PLEASE DO NOT buy any Paul Mitchell products: online, grocery stores etc. These products are not the REAL Paul Mitchell... You can ONLY get the real thing at a salon... This is called ""product diversion"" and it something the beauty industry fights on a daily basis...If not bought in a salon the product could be counterfeit, old etc."
4,provides relief quickly,"I received this shampoo (along with the conditioner) a week ago. So far, I have used them for the last two weeks, not everyday though. I have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes.While there is still SOME itching, my scalp condition has radically changed over the past week. I believe that with consistent use of this product, I should continue to see progress in this area. I also use the soap (100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars) which comes with a bottle of the actual oil one can use for just about anything from toe nail fungus to blemishes and pimples.I've only started using products with tea tree oil in them for about a month but because of their many uses and low cost, I've quickly become a big fan."
2,What a horrible shampoo,"I bought this shampoo because it was recommended that I use something with Tea Tree oil in it to help me with my problem scalp. I'm not sure if this shampoo has helped my scalp problems, but it has made my hair horribly unmanageable. It strips every drop of product or oil from your hair, so when you are done shampooing your hair is a matted mess and straw-like. This shampoo may be good to remove residue from hair every couple weeks or so, but certainly not good for daily use. And for heaven's sake, don't get it in your eyes. Minty fresh is not a good ocular condition."
5,Enjoyable product,"This product, unlike others I've tried ""massages or invigorates"" the scalp. It smells great too. The gal that cuts my hair introduced the product to me years ago.As a guy with really short hair I use this because I like the sensation and the smell."
2,Pepperminty,"I found the peppermint overwhelms the shampoo, not crazy about the cool mint tingle effect. Disappointed since I was hoping for a Tea Tree shampoo, I've had good luck with Bronners Tea Tree products."
3,Use sparingly!,"I like and dislike this shampoo because, on one hand, it cured my nasty scalp rash that was causing scabs after one use, but on the other hand, it dried my scalp out so much after the second use that it was making my hair fall out. It stripped my hair of natural oils so it was very unmanageable after it dried.I would recommend that you only use this shampoo once in a while to clear up any skin problems or to clean the residue from your hair, but don't use it everytime you shampoo."
4,A little harsh,This shampoo has a very minty fragrance and feeling when lathering up but leaves my hair feeling a bit parched or dry. It removes just about all of the natural oils from the hair and causes my curls to go crazy but I have started to follow up the rinse with another shampoo that helps condition the hair as well and things have been much better since. The product has arrived quickly and in good condition. No leaks or problems at all.
3,"Great for hair, but burns my back","I bought this shampoo a few days ago and when i put it in my hair it felt like silk. However, when I washed it out, all the shampoo washes down your back and it hurt my back with a cooling/burning feeling like the kind you get with frost-bite. I don't know if my skin is sensitive or I'm allergic to a certain ingredient, because I'm not allergic to anything, really. But, I gave this 3 stars because my hair was soft and healthy and it worked on my hair. It has a great scent to it, also."
4,request from Iraq,this product is one of the few personal items our Army Avaitor has requested since his deployment in August. I've never tried it myself but it must be good stuff...
1,Awful Stuff! Must be made in China!,"After reading the other one-star review, I've concluded that the formulation must've been changed ... or this junk is being made in China.This crap made my normally silky, shiny hair so dry and brittle, I had to cut an inch off the ends this morning.Anyway, it's full of SULFATES, so in the trash it goes!Useless!"
5,Amazing album,"It's is rare for an album to have so many good songs to choose from that can be made singles and this album is one of them. Besides the singles released Tennessee, Fly Away and Twice The Speed of Life could have easily been released as singles."
3,Listenable country pop,"A steady & consistent group of songs ... not great ... but being their debut, they have improved greatly with each succeeding album ... like all artists, they have to start somehwhere ... and this is that point for Sugarland. Best song on the CD "" Down In Mississippi "" ..."
4,Pretty good cd!,"This cd is pretty good, although there aren't that many songs on it that I sing along to. I really enjoyed ""Love on the inside"" much more. But it's still a good cd, and has a couple awesome songs on it."
1,got burned,"I somtimes like to take chance on an artist or group. Sometimes you hit it, sometimes you get burned. I got scorched on this one. It's got every Nashville/country/corporate cliche in the book - vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, every way. It'll probably catch on with the mainstream ""country"" stations and that's exactly the problem. This thing's about the sex appeal of the lead singer - period. (99% of the female,corporate-country singers out of Nashville are knockouts. Guess average looking girls just can't sing - go figure.)"
5,Sensational Sound!,"After the 1st few seconds of this CD, I was utterly amazed at Jennifer Nettles voice and lyrical originality. I bought this CD just to hear something different and am truly surprised that Sugarland is not more popular than they are. I expect that her voice and the talent of the songwriting and background sounds will set higher standards in Nashville. YOU WILL LOVE THIS RECORD!!"
3,Just OK,There vocals are ok but they need better stronger songs. All the songs start to sound the same after awhile.
3,"Good songs, twang a little overpowering","I enjoy the songs on the album and I love Jennifer Nettles' voice and the harmonies of the other members. What I hate is the way she pronounces her words. The overdone twang in the pronunciation sounds fake beyond belief. My favorite tracks are ""Baby Girl"", (because it grew on my from radio play) ""Stand Back Up"", and ""Something More"" but I enjoy them in spite of the twang, certainly not because. Perhaps it's because I'm a northerner but I just don't like words pronounced this way. It's the same problem I've always had with Reba...love the voice, hate the way she pronounces her words."
2,Selling Out 101,"Listening to Sugarland's demo was a painful experience for me. Many of the reviews already posted hail this album as ""a remarkable collaboration"" and ""better then the sum of its parts."" I need to correct this. Sugarland sounds like everything else on country radio and is different in one very important way - the band, as a whole, is turning their backs on obvious and impressive talent, as opposed to trying to make up for it (as most mainstream bands do.) Please, if you really love the songwriting or Jennifer's voice in ""Twice the Speed of Life"" look for songs like ""Casual Dread"" or ""With Me"" by Soul Miner's Daughter, ""Story of Your Bones"" or ""Page #2"" by Jennifer Nettles Band, or ""Insomniac"" by Billy Pilgrim. This is where these artists really shine - this is glorious and remarkable music that will live on, despite the new, lucrative, mainstream projects currently undertaken by the musicians."
2,Too Much Pop,"Pop is something I dont like in my country music, and thats exactly whats wrong with Sugarland. I like the lead singers twangy voice, but the lyrics and music lean to much to the pop side for me. If you want fresh new country that actually sounds country try The Wrights. The Wrights are better than sugarland and the dixie chicks."
4,Running at top Speed,"Although I am not an avid Country music listener, I have respect for several artist. As an African-American, I like more upbeat songs, but I have fallen in love with ""Just Might (Make Me Believe)."" This song has heart and appeal to anyone who has ever been down, but has the faith and love of someone special. I also enjoy ""Time, TIme, Time"" too. This CD is a must have and althought I only gave it 4 stars(mainly because country isn't my favorite music type), I highly recommend that if you do like country music, buy this CD!"
4,Sugar Me,"Very good, upbeat contemporary country CD. This is a talented trio with their own sound. Jennifer Nettles, lead singer, has a great voice with a wonderful accent - perfect for the music. Really good tunes:Something MoreBaby GirlTennesseeSpeed of Life"
4,Sugarland CD,This is a good CD. I like most of the songs on the album and am glad that I purchased it.
5,I ain't settlin,"This is a great cd. As a person who hardly ever listens to country music, I'm really enjoying this. Great vocals, great music...lets dance! Can't wait for more."
5,Whole CD Fantastic!,"Jennifer Nettles showcases her tremendous voice on this CD. It consists of songs that range from fun to pointant. For a country fan, it is what you listen to when you roll down the windows in the spring and turn up the radio!"
5,good clean music,jennifer and kristen did an excellant job. i really enjoy this cd - it is relaxing and upbeat together. i think it took them both to higher levels on different planes - but they did it gracefully and made it work. another county music cd of good clean music!
5,the best cd known to exist,I love this cd. every song on it is awesome. i can't stop playing it. They write there own songs and sang their hearts out on it. I would suggest that everybody owns a copy.
3,Sugerland Twice The Speed Of Life,"Jennifer Nettles has a beautiful voice that comes across in the songs of the album, from the ballads ""Baby Girl"" and ""Just Might (Make Me Believe)"" to the more uptempo ""Something More.""I usually don't listen much to country music but I can really recommend this album.Linda"
2,knock off the accent!,"I want to like sugarland!! But the way the lead singer (Jennifer) keeps pushing her voice and 'accent' it is impossible for me too. Not only is she making their songs sound twangy, dated, and annoying- she' pushing her voice too much!! Ugh- go back to their first cd for her real, pure voice."
2,Big Let Down,"I heard a couple of these songs on the radio and was excited because I liked them so much, but the rest of the CD was a big let down. It was one song played ten times. If you like ""Baby Girl"" and ""Something more"", download them on itunes or Warez, otherwise you're paying 8 bucks a song because the rest are lousy."
5,Awesome,"A great sound from a great band. The music is real and heartfelt. The lyrics are punchy and draw you into the song. You will be singing along in no time. I highly recommend this to all who love music and what it is supposed to do to a person. Even if you don't like country, This just may change your mind. Buy it today!!"
4,Unit Works Well,Charges my old battery as well and works very well. I wish the plug folded into the unit. Glad I bought
2,Not for use with rabbits,"The quality is fine, however, the pan is impregnated with Microban, which will repel mold and bacteria. Microban is made with a chemical that is considered to be a carcinogen if ingested and all rabbits will chew on the rim of the pan from time to time. I purchased it for my pet rabbit because of the high sides and back, but will not take the chance of him getting sick or worse from ingesting the plastic with this chemical in it, so I could not use it. I did not know it was made with this chemical and that is why I rated the pan with only two stars.I would think that this pan would be fine for cats, as they generally do not chew their litter boxes."
1,Doesn't fit in the enclosed chest...litter and urine EVERYWHERE!,"I bought this to go inside of the enclosed wood chest because it matched the dimensions listed in the description. I figured the high back might prevent litter from coming out so easily, and would catch urine sprays. Instead, I ended up with a huge mess that I had to clean up daily. I'll stick with the Buddha box!"
4,Worked for my kitten.... not for my cat.,"When my energetic kitten started spraying litter all over the floor, I sought a solution- this high-sided box in conjunction with a textured mat beneath it. It helped immensely. For the better part of a year. As kitty grew, though, it was no longer just litter spraying around. Yeh, yuck. Then he got clever and started turning to face the high end, squirting over the low end, past the catch mat, onto my wooden floors. When I turned the box, he over-sprayed onto my wall. No longer a kitten, but a muscular 13-pound male, I knew I needed a new solution. This litter pan was great for my kitten, but as he grew, not for my big male cat.I liked this pan for quite a while. For a smaller cat, or a female, I think it is very good, and solves some problems. The price was certainly right.I ended up buying a new box: all sides are very high, with a top-entry hole. In use for 2 weeks, it seems to be doing the trick."
5,High back litter pan,"This pan works great for my two cats, one female and one male ....... A very good purchase for anyone who has a cat that pee's over the side of the regular size pans and it really helps to stop the tracking of litter as well ....."
4,another brilliant rock album from Cheap Trick,"For many Cheap Trick fans this marks the end of the ""classic era."" While the follow-up to this one, All Shook Up, is arguably their best work, it also marked their decline in the pop music industry and fall from the top of the charts for a few years until they returned with a couple of power ballads. Anyway, Dream Police is a must have for tricksters and contains some of their best songs. Like the album before it, Heaven Tonight, Dream Police kicks off with a pop rock masterpiece as the opener and doesn't really contain a bad song all the way through. Some are better than others but there's nothing to skip on this CD. Standout tracks include: Way of the World, Gonna Raise Hell, I'll Be With You Tonight, Need Your Love."
2,Desperate need of a remaster,"I bought this album after buying the reissues of their first three albums, the Budakon remaster and their 1997 Red Ant album. These albums sound rich and alive. This CD sounds flat and lifeless. The material is also lower tier to these other albums.Hey, CBS, find the original masters and give this album a new lease on life!"
5,Ranks right up there!!!!,"Yeah, this CD rocks.I have the original album from 1979. I remember buying it my frosh year. It still sounds as relevant now as it did then.If possible, it is better than ""Heaven Tonight"".Buy this CD, it ranks right up there with HT.Bill"
5,"5 star album, 2 star cd","I believe that it is unanimous with the reviewers here that this cd sounds flat. The music is great, and I remember its release well. I guess it is a bit sentimental because it was one of the first 10 albums I bought. I was at a liberating summer camp when it was new, and we wore that record out. The first four were the ones that were continuously repeated, and I think it has aged fairly well because the vinyl still sounds good if you can find it."
3,"Great Album, Half-Hearted ""Remastering""","The album gets five stars: I'm slamming the ""remastering,"" which is apparently by some hack named Vic Anesini, who clearly did little more than add some equalization to the original master. In other words, this isn't remastering: this is rereleasing. I have a Japanese remaster of this great album and the difference is stunning: the Japanese disc explodes from the speakers, whereas the sound on this new reissue is thinner, with less bass and narrower dynamic range, than the reissues of ""Heaven Tonight"" and ""In Color,"" which came out 7 years ago or something. Typical record company ripoff. What's more, the packaging is junk: all photos inside are in black and white, whereas the original album art was elaborately designed, with vibrant color. The live tracks are ok, but perfunctory. I was hoping for more."
4,cheap trick is gonna raise hell!!!dream police!!,"cheap trick,s dream police is my favorite cheap trick album!!!dream police was released in 1979.i think dream police is one of cheap tricks best albums ever!!for me the great cuts are;dream police,the house is rocking[with domestic problems]this particular song reminds me of something that might have been influenced by the beatles;abbey road album from 1969.also great from this album is;way of the world,gonna raise hell!!, which i think is the best tune on the album,need your love,i,ll be with you tonight and i know what i want!!i like some of the live bonus cuts too!!also the album cover is great too.check out rick nielson,s racing flag colored gibson explorer!!!this is a great cd.grab it!!"
3,Dream Police(d) 'Off The Radio'...wasn't it nice back in the '80's and '70's when Cheap Trick could be heard 'On The Radio'?,"Despite Tom Werman's previous screwups, he wasback for round three with the 'Tricksters andhe did some of his best (and worst) work here.'Dream Police', 'Way of the World', 'Voices','The House is Rockin' with Domestic Problems'(Tom's?) and two or three more cuts here arevery good to great.Rick's best guitar album to date. 'But thendepression set in', a line from a Bill Murraymovie, seems appropriate; Who gave THAT Bassista singing part? I Know What I Want is one of theworst songs to ever be assosiated with Cheap Trick(unless Robin or Rick sing it, which both have -when Tom was no longer in the band) and GonnaRaise Hell is pure garbage - nine-and-a-halfminutes of mindless guitar solos that Rick andTrick used to parody with their earlier work.Only Nine songs? Come on guys. Yet, with these flawsit was still their best (NON-Live) work to date."
2,"Small inexpensive, but not do good overall","Pros;1. It does have a very effecient switching power supply.2. Half the price of ToteVision or Marshall Electronics monitors of the same size.3. Removeable stand (see below).Cons;1. There are many versions of these 8"" & 10"" monitors, so it's easy to order the wrong one and the model numbers are easy to mix up.2. The stand is very flimsy. It's very easy to tip over. You can use a photo tripod to 'mount' the TV or make a stand yourself (highly recomemded).3. The 'hue' control is at it's far range of 'green/yellow'. If your image is 'magenta' (purple) you can't adjust for it.4. It uses a very small and fragile connector for the A/V input. Very easy to break the connector and/or the cables with no way of replaceing the plug.5. Very narrow viewing angle (as usual for a low cost LCD TV).6. Noise and a wavy pattern with darker images. Shows up on test patterns very easily."
2,LCD Monitor,"I purchased this item to monitor ""on location"" video recording applications. The furnished stand is unstable. The video connections on the monitor are poorly located. The viewable range is very narrow and not suitable for this sort of usage."
5,Husky Liners,The Husky Liners we bought are light weight and durable. They are very easy to install and fit perfectly into our Jeep. We also bought the floor mats for front and back. Great product!
3,UnInspired,"I purchased a WeatherTech liner for my wife's Volvo wagon and they did not have a custom size for my Jeep Grand Cherokee so I purchased a Husky.We carry around our dog some and the shedded hair was becoming a pain. WeatherTech was more expensive, but better quality and fit my wife's car perfectly. The Husky mat was a disapointment after getting the other one the day before. The quality of material wasn't as good, and the fit was not near exact. Im going to keep it because it serves the purpose but would recommend WeatherTech over Husky if they have your vehicles size."
5,Very Creative...Written off by those who are saturated by boring metal,This is a great Neo prog band with some solid musicianship. They have some cool ideas-I don't think I've ever heard a song such as Bugeye. Nice to see that there are still bands out there that are not simply rehashing the same formula over and over.(like a lot of metal bands)
4,The title says it all,The title is punchy and so is the film. Definitely one to have for your collection.Can't wait for a sequel by this production team and actors.Great film
1,Awful,"I bought this on the recommendation of the other reviewers. This is the worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life. To quote another reviewer on About.com: ""grim, dull, poorly-made, torture retread, unoriginal, unlikeable characters"" ""Mediocre acting"" was also mentioned and that is being kind."
4,Mittens keep me warm in Boston,"My friend Chung will be pleased to know that he introduced me to Mittens and now I am a pleased fan. Their music is feel good and straightforward. I appreciate their upbeat tune. It's hard to describe who they sound like, I don't know enough music to accurately compare. However all you need to know is this: Mittens are fantastic! Help these guys out, they're well deserving and have been in the underground Boston music scene for years. All of my friends are fans and you will be too..."
2,Not at all the typical Heyer novel!,"Set in the '20s, Pastel is not at all what I've come to expect of Heyer. It's witty dialogue doesn't quite make up for the lack of action in this comedy of manners. The characters are not so well developed as one normally finds in Heyer's period pieces (Regency, etc.). It's a pleasant enough little read, but it's not the normal romp Heyer's readers expect."
3,"God,Honor, Fatherland","The narative of the personalities of the individuals in the book was interesting and refreshing, giving the history a depth and personality. However, I was very dissapointed to see that the book contained not a single color photograph beyond that of the cover."
1,don't buy this product,"I used the HDF Sensor Brush for the first time. I blew clean compressed air against the brush before using it. Not only did it not remove dust from my sensor, it created streaks on the sensor. That is, it left the camera in worse condition than it was before I used the brush. I have sent the camera to the manufacturer for repair."
3,"No, this isn't an .....","Sorry if you thought this was about ... Nope, the book is about dinner as a time to connect with family and friends. In fact, its a bit too much on the connection part and too little on the nuts and bolts of actually throwing a party. Primarily it is commonsense and sometimes it is good to see that through ""objective"" eyes. It would be nicer though if it have had more concrete ideas for hosts and guests, especially at this price."
4,Great performances,"These Christmas Cantatas of Bach are, on occasion, music Bach has stolen from himself. They are seldom done and I think this is the only recording of many of them. Koopman does his early music sound and forces are small and very accurate. Soloists are good and sound is excellent. I am pleased with my purchase."
2,This album I would not reccomend to everybody.,"I would recommend this album for people who knows Argentinian music, Tangos and Culture. I think it is designed for pretty narrow group of people."
1,Coleccion De Oro,"This is not a CD by Raul Di Blasio.There is not one selection By Raul Di Blasio on it. I purchased it because it says Raul Di Blasio, but it is not."
4,Nice little flag pole,Nice clean chrome finish. The tube walls are thick enough that there is no flex in this pole even when heading into the wind. Definitely recommended.
4,The One and Only!,"The Call is an Awesome band and I regret there are not around. Reconciled has some of their best songs. I happen to like Blood Red a whole lot. The singer and songwriter has Magnetism. I once saw them at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and the band was Phenomenal to say the least! Why they never made it big I will never know, compared to some of the crap you listen these days from so called Big Bands. Their music can be described at fully energetic, melodic, lyrically brilliant. They have many many great songs and they sound as good today as back when they first came out. My Ultimate Respect for The Call: ""I am standing at the edge of my mind, If I look down I might fall into ..."" This Band Rocks and in my book they are The One and Only. Very Charismatic singer and excellent band, 4 Big Stars for The Call!!!"
4,Quite good,"""Reconciled"" was the first ""alternative"" record (as in vinyl) I bought as a teen, and it left a lasting impression. It's inspired and inspirational, with a distinct sound and voice."
3,CD does not play on all CD players,CD plays in the car but not on a portable radio/CD player. The CD came quickly and price was fair.
5,Wore the tape out! Glad it's still available.,"I bought this when it first came out (I was also extremely impressed with Modern Romans), and I wore the tape out. This is not syrupy pop nor heavy metal. The lyrics mean something other than the typical drug, sex, and ""it's all about me"" stuff that we are bombarded with. Think of U2 lyrics with John Cougar Mellancamp music."
2,Not that flattering,Not nearly as good as the majestic pants for kids. The material seems thinner and they are not cut right in my opinion (as someone who has played alot of baseball)
5,wonderful,The history of the Mormon pioneers and Joseph Smith leaves you in awe... what valiant people...Book came in great condition and FAST
2,This books has holes.,"I have been a Graphic Designer for several years and have become very efficient at teaching myself new programs with well written books. Unfortunately, I have found this book to be a bit confusing. It seem as though topics are covered with small bits of pertinent information missing. I had to use the Quick Start guide to fill in the holes of this book so I could continue to use it. Maybe this book should be reworked then re-released. I think it has the beginnings of a good starter book but for now its a struggle."
1,The book's paper was useful in my furnace,"But as a lucid and helpful instruction guide for Maya, I have to say, ""Stay Away!"" I learned Maya using the infinitely better book by the same publisher, 'Learning Maya 5: Foundation.' It succeeds everywhere the present book fails. Something you might pay attention to: the only positive reviews of this book are by people who live near the author and have likely taken his class! Just kidding :)At any rate, do yourself a favor and don't try to learn Maya with this book."
2,Frustrating and painful to follow!,"Hi dear all. I'm a beginner in the field of 3D modeling.I've bought this book for many reasons:1. Beginner-oriented level;2. Prestigious editors and Publisher (Alias + Sibex!);3. Overall Amazon ratings ****/54. Price (compared to other Alias/Sibex titles...)Although the book is nice and well done, it lacks some in-between steps to complete the tutorials.As another reader rightly says, the tutorials provided with the Personal Learning Edition of Maya are much better detailed.I can't understand why such a great publisher makes naif mistakes like that.Ciao -- Marco."
1,Very confusing book that should have been more thorough,"There are many basic topics such as nurbs stitching that are not taught in this book. Worse of all, some times the instructions not even complete so you have to guess at random as to what you need to do to make the scene work."
3,Great comeback,"After one of the most disappointing books in the series, Ms. Stabenow comes up with a suspenseful and enjoyable read in Midnight Come Again. Away from the bush and Kate's home, she is healing the wounds of losing Jack, only to find herself running the assault on a smuggling ""syndicate"". Kate once again comes out on top. Good story, if it is getting to be a bit too predictable."
2,Midnight Come Again,"Terribly disappointing that she has left the area of Alaska that readers have come to enjoy reading about. I feel that I not only lost a character I had become fond of as well as a relationship that was interesting, but the entire region as well! And the mafia is a predictable, much less interesting twist than the local people/characters that I had come to look forward to reading about. Kate is just not as appealing anymore. I just can't get interested in reading more Stabenow books, unfortunately.."
3,better than last time,"As usual this is a good book but only rated it three stars as there isstill to much sex/violence. Please, please dear author let Kate getthrough one book without getting beat up. These are great stories butsure could use some more mystery in them instead. Her sex experiencewith Chopin was not needed. It changed too much of the energy betweenthem. I hope they remain friends and not lovers in future books.Though the changes starting in him are interesting. Does he ever paychild support?"
4,my opinion,"I love Kate, Dana is a wonderful writerher books grab you from the start and don't let go .Can't wait for the next one."
5,An Delightful and Necessary Addition to New York Guides,"An elegant writer and gifted independent scholar, Francis Morrone has done his adopted home proud in An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn. With sharp descriptions and apposite facts, Morrone conveys both the complexity and vibrancy of one of New York City's largest boroughs. Readers may well disagree with a few of his assured opinions but what use is a guidebook without a point of view? Morrone's perceptive comments, illustrated by James Iska's graceful photographs, make An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn a boon for both the Brooklyn visitor and the armchair New York fan alike."
5,very happy,"I found this book to be one of the most concise and well written I have come across in my training. There is a tremendous amount of material without any of the filler. I recommend this book to any medical student, non-anesthesia resident or first year anesthesia resident."
4,This book runneth over with fun!,I loved this book for the most part. Angel really is just like a young Bridget Jones. It is funny and realistic and enjoyable. The secondary characters also made the book so enjoyable - especially her parents and Mrs. Something-Hyphenated and her kids. I hope someday someone makes a movie of this. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because sometimes it does go overboard with the fat jokes. But overall the comedy and romantic quotients were high!
1,A Complete Let-Down,"From all the things I heard about this book, it sounded like a fun, light, wonderful read. It turned out to be B-O-R-I-N-G!! The plot was good, but the writing was terrible. It was nothing like the great English teen chick-lit I've read (Louise Rennison is amazing, and even Cathy Hopkins is excellent compared to this). The main character, Angel, is overweight, and wants to be skinnier. Sounds like ""Girls Under Pressure"" and Ellie's dilemma. Her friends are perfect to her... the way Ellie views her friends in the ""Girls"" Trilogy (now a quartet, I believe) and the way Lucy views her friends in the ""Mates, Dates and..."" series. Her friend Minnie is amazing at designing clothing. I'm drawing a blank to the exact character, but it's one of the girls from either ""Girls"" or ""Mates, Dates, and..."" I think it might be Lucy from ""M, D, a..."" But still it's a boring read, and I suggest you move on to something more worthwhile!"
1,SLOW SERVICE,I ordered this book and it took WEEKS for it to come to me. Pathetic. I was forced to buy it for a class and the wait for the book caused that I get significantly behind in my work. The stories are also pretty cheesy and not universally applicable. I do not recommend.
3,Buyer Beware!,"The legacy of the great King Records is in flux, limbo, a twilight zone of mishandling and uncertainty. Shame, because this indie label boasted arguably the greatest roster of blues, R&B, country artists in the 40s and 50s. This disc, mastered in 1988 is a disgrace and disservice to the legendary Lonnie Johnson, who scored several R&B chart makers in his 1947--52 tenure with Syd Nathan's label. The disc offers 24 tracks of gold: blues, ballads all with great singing and guitar playing. However, for SOME reason these tracks are truncated, edited, spliced to all fit in under two minutes, and whole sections of intros, bridges and solos are omitted. A travesty. Perhaps someone will offer a reasonably priced box set of Lonnie's King output. It's great stuff. Pass on this unless you have no other option."
3,Hindi English Dictionary,"This is a wonderful product for people beginning to learn the language of Hindi. The shipping and delivery was excellent. I am not a beginner but was looking for a Hindi English dictionary to expand my vocabulary and be on my to becoming fluent, unfortunately this dictionary doesn't have much in it so it wasn't a big help to me. I recommend this for absolute beginners only, otherwise look for something with a bit more substance. It is a good product, but I would suggest the seller put more information regarding its size and the lower skill level it is meant for. If I had known more about it, I wouldn't have bought it. Despite of of this, the product is still wonderful for beginners."
2,Not for a Serious Hindi Learner,"This review is a warning for a person, who wants to learn Hindi for more than a short tourist trip. All its sections are too basic, and could be printed in a much smaller book -- on average, it contains 7 expressions per page. And its only advantage is very good print quality.""Say it in Hindi"" is a much better option in terms of expressions and vocabulary. The only its disadvantage is small and unclear font. And H-E/E-H dictionary by Rupert Snell is a much better alternative for a dictionary, grammar, and the word use (included in many entries of the E-H part).If someone needs this book, I gladly give it away."
2,Not for the beginner...,"I will be flying to India for the first time this October, and bought a ton of books to help me understand India, its language and culture. This book 'Hindi Dictionary and Phrasebook' is not much of a help. I am an absolute neophyte when it comes to other languages...and thought I was buying a book that would start with the real basics. I was wrong! Though it has all the words and phrases you could ever hope for, those words need to be broken down for the beginner like myself...a better method of pronunciation would be great. It was so frustrating that I ended up giving the book to the local Thrift Shop. I have just ordered two more Hindi/English dictionaries and will post a review on those soon...the seller had very good, fast service!"
4,GREAT DEAL,"This is by far the best deal you will find on a brand new double pane anti fog mask anywhere! I have been paint-balling with this mask on six occasions now, and it has been great. No fagging whatsoever, and I am a heavy sweater, so I usually have no trouble fogging up my masks... The shell is large and protective, it's almost like a full helmet as far as head coverage. Your head, ears and neck are well protected.Their are a couple drawbacks however:1. Due to the hard plastic shell, wearing this mask on top of your head in between games is considerably uncomfortable.2. The size of the actual goggles is smaller on the inside of the mask. In other words, the foam on the inside rests considerably close to the eyes, cutting off some of your peripheral vision... If you are purchasing this mask for a child, then this will not be an issue."
2,Rough lining,JT uses el-chepo foam lining around the goggle so it was really rough on the skin. I recommend the Spectra line as it uses a nicer foam.
4,"""Barbarians, from the Outside Looking In""","Bury takes a unique perspective in this work. He describes how the early Germanic peoples migrated, and later penetrated into the confines of the Roman Empire; likewise, he focuses on the flood of Asiatic barbarians as well. Bury does an excellent job portraying the motives of the Barbarians, and how they ended up contributing to the formation of modern Europe. The epic un-barbarianization, rather than the deterioration of the Empire, is the crux of this work. This book is complete,concise, and very time saving for busy students...highly recommended."
5,Excelente combo de perliculas,"Muy buenas peliculas,muy buenas las extras que poseen y aun precio muy bueno,ojala pueda conseguir mas de esa clase de combos!!!"
3,"Bad picture quality, but an OK deal for the price","Found at a warehouse store for about $12.I was most interested in owning 300, followed by Troy, and least interested in Alexander.Unfortunately, I would say Alexander has the best picture quality, followed by Troy which is ""okay"". But the picture quality for 300 is almost shockingly bad. Very grainy images throughout, and some scenes have a little brightness flickering."
3,"3-disc, two good and one regular","I wanted to mention that the disc quality is regular, single disc convinced me Troy and Alexander, not that the quality of the image of ""300 is low,"" perhaps for that price. Otherwise regular."
5,The British know how to make movies!,"If you are into period piece movies (even if you are not) this is a must see! It's about a young English country lady who is lured into the city by a 'so-called' friend & is soon taught the wicked ways of prostitution. It starts with her innocent, quiet & trusting in others & slowly she learns what she has become & what her life could turn out to be! This movie is meant for an older audience as there is much talk of sex & there is a fair share of nudity. Really interesting & quite funny @ times! The British sure know how to make a quality film! Enjoy!"
3,No muy buena versión.,"Todo lo que hace la BBC es impecable y ésta no es la excepción.Pero esta ""Fanny Hill"" es una versión muy distanciada del libro, se distorsiona la novela de John Cleland.No la recomiendo para nada, si nunca han leido el libro o visto la otras versiones, a lo mejor les guste. Es un novelón rosa con un ligero (muy ligero) toque picaresco.Le doy 3 estrellas porque es de la BBC y como producción es buena."
4,"Hat works good, fits on my head","For a cheap winter hat, this worked out pretty well. Didn't have to deal with too much snow this winter, but it was warm for my trip up to Leavenworth, WA this holiday season. What more can you expect?"
4,Very satisfied,"I purchased the pot set as a gift for my grand daughter. She was very pleased, and suprised at the quality. I'm pleased with this purchase, and the price was unbelievable."
4,good not bad,"not heavy very lightlong lasting if u treat it welli have been using for more than 3-4 years , now i noticed little wear and tearbut usable for another year"
2,Not what we expected,"These pots are very lightweight and seem to be very cheaply made. We were not impressed,even at this low price."
5,Great Book on Blogs,Hugh is one of the pioneers of blogging. He presents a good summary of what blogging is and how blogging will impact our future.
5,Blog New World,"Hugh Hewitt's newest book, ""Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World"" has a breathless urgency in its message about the current impact and future promise of blogs. Hugh presents practical and innovative approaches to corporate and niche blogging that will appeal to forward-thinking publishers, musicians, sports franchises, and just about any special interest group.Hugh Hewitt is easy to listen to on his daily talk radio show, and he is equally easy to read. His style is briskly conversational, to the point, and always buttressed by meticulous research and presentation of facts.Hugh closes ""Blog"" with a clarion call to readers to launch into the rapidly expanding blogosphere. His persuasive argument is so effective that it makes me grateful that my little blog, www.oneclearcall.blogspot.com, has been up and running since August 2004."
2,Condescending and Arrogant Tone,"I received this book for Christmas. I looked forward to reading it since blogging is one of my favorite hobbies. But it was a struggle to finish it. It's written with an arrogant tone. I almost wonder whether Hugh Hewitt actually wrote the book or if some ghost writer did.I don't think I learned very much from reading it. Basically, the message of the book is: You better blog because it's important to your business, your faith, and your political candidate.I didn't bother reading the appendices because the main text was so torturous.I'm grateful for the present because this book is one the things I wanted for Christmas, but personally, you're not missing much if you don't read it. A definite thumbs down.P.S. This is not a very scholarly written review. It's my first review, but I hope to write others that are more serious, especially for books that are worth my time."
1,The Los Angeles Times....,"...got it right in their review of this book (a review which Hewitt snidely dismisses on his blog). This is a quickly dashed off screed of partisan hackery designed to make a quick buck for the holiday season. Full of howlers that would keep any self-respecting information technologist doubled up in laughter, it rambles pointlessly, overstating the influence of blogs on information dissemination on page after page.Mr. Hewitt must have a hard time fitting his head through doorways."
5,IF ITS NOT CLOSE THEY CAN'T CHEAT,"Hugh Hewitt is an enthusiastic writer, analyst and blogger. This book is for Republicans and Conservatives and is an insiders long look at politics, elections and a very useful ""What To Do Book"".Easily read and thoughtful, it makes the most hardened political junkie teachable."
1,Not a Lot Here,"I was looking for a book about the potential of Blogs to facilitate organizational and social change. Learning about Guttenberg and Martin Luther and the history of how text transformed our world was interesting but not particulary helpful in exploring Blogging. What was really disappointing is the ""right wing political"" bent to the book. In describing the bloggers ability to bring down Trent Lott, John Kerry and Dan Rather I was disturbed by the lack of recognition that many of the reports given by bloggers were blatantly false (Swift Boat Veterens) but lauded as heroic. Any technology can be misused for unscrupulous means and this book honors these practices. The content is fair - the ethics are questionable."
1,Don't waste your money or valuable reading time!,"Quite simply, I just couldn't get through the boorish political slamming. The author did not deliver on the promise ""Understanding The Information Reformation That's Changing Your World"". It's more about Hughy Hewitt's political tyrants than a serious inquiry on Blogs. He should take a course in writing, or run for office. Wish I could get a refund."
2,"Good Point, but Hard to Finish","I agree with all the other reviewers. This book was given to me as a present, and it took all my willpower to read it because of the incessant need to talk politics. However. Mentioning that Fox News is Fair and Balanced--three times--and that CNN is dead, (""nobody's watching"" ???) and calling CNN sophomoric names, and dismissing all mainstream media except Fox, really put me off. One challenge for Hugh...IMO blogs are going to run under the radar for two reasons. Few people have the time to read and click through all that info. Second, the people you really want reading the sites (newer computer users) now have computers full of adware and malware."
1,Condescending to Non-Conservatives,"This is nothing more than a piece dedicated to bragging about the part blogs played in the electoral success of George Bush in the 2004 presidential election. It is arrogant and assumes others are too stupid to make use of the blogosphere. If you are a Bushee, you will probably love it. If you are anything else and looking for information on how to get started blogging, it is useless and condescending."
1,Worthless Piece of Junk.,I am not criticizing Hewlett being the first to market with a book that capitalizes on the evolving technology everyone has come to know as the Web. I would have rather seen somebody with a little more gravitas write about it. Obviously Hewlett is a novice who never heard of bulletin boards or uunet particularly since he compared the impact of blogging to Gutenberg inventing moveable type. All he is doing is leveraging his radio show with books and blogging. Blog offers nothing of import other that to inspire others to try their hand at self promotion. Kind of like an est seminar leader pushing for you to take more seminars or a televangelist who asks a donation for some two-bit trinket.You would be better served to read The Cathedral and the Bazaar and it will not cost you anything.I give Blog a solid D.
2,Double Helix Review,"The reason for my low rating of this book is its mundane plot. Although the book did give insight on the making of the double helix, it failed to keep an interesting story. Although some of the characters had interesting personalities I feel that that were barely excersized because of the books dull storyline. I reccommend this book to those who wish to learn about the making of the double helix, not to those looking for a page turning novel. James Watson may be an innovative scientist, but he isn't much of a writer."
4,the book was perfect but it arrived a 2 weeks after the mailing date,the book was perfect but it arrived a 2 weeks after the mailing date
1,Worst Book Ever,"All I can say is, some lunatic at my school thought that a bunch of 9th graders would be able to read, understand, and write about this book."
4,A complementary view point...,"Most readers of ""The Double Helix"" would be further enlightened by Anne Sayre's ""Rosalind Franklin and DNA""."
1,"Yes indeedy, this is a quick piece of fiction.","As a science teacher it is horrifying to me that anyone is being required to read this self-serving piece of fiction for a science class. (Unless perhaps as a negative example of deplorable ethics.) Watson's account of the discovery of the structure of the DNA helix is so fraught with falsehoods that it could at best only be called historical fiction. His need to vilify and degrade Rosalind Franklin (whose essential (and stolen) work he used) can hardly be something that is admirable. For a factual account of events read Rosalind Franklin & DNA by Anne Sayre instead. No, it will not be an easy read, but you will certainly get a different view and it is backed up with facts and dates."
2,I don' like it does not correspond to my reaction. This book does not correspond to my expectations,I thought it would be an extended version and up to date of the original book containing recent achievements in this rapidly growing field. If I would have known that it is only about side stories of the original work I certainly would not have ordered book
3,Scientific competition.,"Prof. Watson tells us his story of the discovery of the DNA structure, a crucial scientific break-through.It is more or less a race between the US (Linus Pauling) and the UK (the duo Crick/Watson).The reader should have a decent chemical background for a full appreciation of the problems involved, for instance, the crucially important discovery of the ketone function.This book gives also a good picture of the working and living conditions, the character clashes, the calm atmosphere and the closeness at the English top universities in the fifties of last century.A worth-while read."
3,"Read it, if you want to be a scientist.","I am an undergradudate student dreaming of a biologist. I think this book is very helpful to pre-scientists as well as lay people, for it shows failures and disappointments hidden behind a 'great discovery' together with how they are treated and overcome. I was also impressed by the scientific passion represented vividly in this book."
2,I Must Not Be the Target Audience,"** The Double Helix was read as the December selection for our book club. **I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA."
3,"Interesting, but not captivating","I found this somewhat interesting, but it got into some 'history' that I didn't care that much about. Still the underlying history of fascination with the body being a guide to the universe -- yes for over 1000 years -- made it all worthwhile."
4,I really enjoyed this first-hand account of the discovery of DNA.,"I felt this was a truthful outpouring of Watson's first-hand account. The discovery of DNA's structure was so monumental in this feild, it is hard not to enjoy this book."
3,Not that difficult,"I began this book with some trepidation. I am not a science scholar by any means, so I wasn't sure how much of the book I would understand. And true, I didn't grasp a lot of the scientific explanations, but what I found interesting, and humorous, was the description of the many characters and their personality traits. They could all be right out of the TV show ""The Big Bang Theory."" The book is a quick read, as long as you don't get bogged down in the science, and interesting to discover the workings and social interactions of the scientists involved in their quest to discovery DNA."
2,Not a Fav Book,"This book was required for one of my college courses, which is the only reason that I finished it. Parts of the book were interesting, but it was hard to follow. Also, Watson has the very dry humor of a British scientist, despite the fact that he is an America. All in all, I did not enjoy reading it, but someone who is thrilled by DNA might be interested in it."
2,Who Should Get the Nobel Prize?,"After reading this, I really have to wonder about the value of awarding prizes in science when most (all?) discoveries build on previous discoveries. Does science need competition to advance? Watson did seem fueled by a competitive desire to be first to discover the structure of DNA. However, his ethics seemed questionable and as other reviewers mentioned, he basically stole Rosalind Franklin's data and work. I would like to read a more objective third-person account of the ""discovery"" of the DNA structure.Having said that, this book provided a moderately interesting account of the time and the personalities involved, and it gave me some insight into scientific collaboration and in-fighting. I did not understand the science so I skipped quickly through those parts. I never got too involved in the drama and did not get any deep insight from this book."
3,It's ok.,"The book was in good shape. Older, which is what I was expecting. The book took a long time to get here though. I am glad I didn't need it for class yet!"
4,Very interesing story about the discovery of DNA structure.,"Though the structure of DNA is now common knowledge to virtually everyone (both scientist and layman alike), reading this book really put into context the excitement of of having made this huge discovery. I really enjoyed reading this little book and it actually changed my perception of researchers from ""strange people with thick glasses who spend their whole day looking at a dark spot on some rare beetle"" to ""interesting people with somewhat thin glasses who still spend their whole day looking at some dark spot on a beetle"". Seriously, if you think science is boring - this book is especially for you. Recommended"
4,DNA discovery,Excellent book formulating the personalities and egos behind the race for DNA. Interesting and well written. Add a star if you are in the field.
4,"Excellent for everyone, but only one voice","This book is exceptional for anyone wishing to know the tale of the ""discovery"" of DNA. It's great for knowing how exciting science can be (and should be) for the people involved. It's great in that it doesn't require too much, if any, technical knowledge to understand. My *only* complaint is inevitible -- it's one participant's view. I read this years ago, so I don't remember how much, if at all, Dr. Watson dealt with this, but how sad that the female scientist who the got much of their information from was not honored and is pretty much forgotten by most people, simply because she died before they were up for the Nobel Prize (the Nobel foundation doesn't award posthumously). And how ironic that she died from cancer brought on (most likely) by the machinerey she used to do her science.Read this book, it's great. Just keep some solemnity for those whose voices aren't quite heard."
3,A quick read. Goes well with beer and peanuts.,"Watson was brilliant in bringing pieces of his vague memory and prejudices. What we have here is in part the fact of history and in part a very enjoyable work of fiction.Really, people who read this book usually finishes in a few hours. This is amazing compared to the time it takes to read the hopeless eulogy given by Anne Sayer.However, as a man of considerable authority, Watson should have taken the usual scholary precautions and double-chekced when he was talking about ""people"". I think any serious reader must consult Anne Sayer, albeit painful, for a balanced viewpoint."
4,Good book,"Good book, very easy to read despite its scientific background. As an autobiography, it also makes no attempt to remain neutral, which makes it much more interesting than your average textbook."
4,excellent,This book is a must for any body interested in how great discoveries actually happen. Watson is one of two who co-discovered the structure of DNA. This is his acount of the time of discovery. Watson fills the readers in on the details of how a discovery happens from both scientific and personal perspectives. Watson writes about how he and his partner Crick work their way towards one of the great dscoveries of the 20th century. Watson also writes about personal dislikes and how men and women of science can be every bit as petty as their lay counterparts. Watson writes about backbiting among the various scientists as well as the heady excitement of the work. This book is a must read because it is from the horses mouth and the horse did a great job.
4,the double helix,a lively account of the personal and professional life and quest for the structure of dna by a young brillant american in london . the science world of the 1950ies is brought to life complete with the zest for competition to advance knowledge and contribute . it is especially interesting due to the present advances in gene sequencing and the stem cell controversy. the regeneration of cells via dna is simply awesome and leads one to think THE MASTER DESIGNER OF THE UNIVERSE CREATED A BEAUTIFUL SYSTEM .
4,Zorn does 50's jazz,"Sonny Clark recorded a streak of good albums for Blue Note between 1957 and 1962, before dying in 1963. The Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet is John Zorn on alto, Wayne Horvitz on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Bobby Previte on drums. Zorn and Horvitz have especially secure avant-garde bona fides, but this 1986 CD is mostly a throwback. There are a few modern touches (fewer than, for example, Ken Vandermark's Joe Harriott tribute, ""Straight Lines""), but this disc wouldn't be too out of place in an earlier era. I rate music as comparably good as a 50's or 60's Blue Note. A more adventerous tribute could have found a way to improve on the originals, but that's not what the Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet did. The novelty of hearing John Zorn play straight jazz gives this disc a leg up over buying another old one, so I recommend it."
4,great for cultural appropriateness but needs a proof reader!,"This book has insightful and accurate reviews of culture and cultural appropriateness; however if you buy the book don't trust the foreign language words or phrases 100%. In the case of the Czech and Slovak section, most of the words are spelled wrong and in some cases just wrong. I wonder who did the research? They should have consulted with a native speaker before the book went to print."
1,try again !,This books portrays an arrogant American view of Europe. Don't believe the advice you read ! Most words and phrases are misspelled and the advice is way too stereotypical.
2,Bad research,"Another reviewer mentioned how many of the words and Czech and Slovak (I think those were the two mentioned languages mentioned) were spelled wrong. It is really, really bad in the Danish department. The Danish have three extra letters in their alphabet: , and . However, all the letters O and A have been changed into or , when a word with the letter appears, it has been changed into e. Some V's have been exchanged with U's, and so forth. A lot of words are just plainly spelled wrong. Don't expect to be understood by a native Dane when quoting this book. It's a good thing most of them understand English, then.(Now I just hope the Danish letters will appear correctly on your computer, otherwise this review might look weird)"
1,Needs a good copy editor...,It's hard to take advice seriously from a book as packed with grammatical errors as this volume!
5,Buy this Collection Set,"If you even have a slight interest in the Black Adder series or think Rowan Atkinson somewhat amusing, then buy this compilation. If you really love Black Adder and think Rowan Atkinson may be one of the funniest people alive, then buy this as well.This compilation includes all episodes from all four runs of Black Adder plus a one-hour stand-alone episode. The funniest are probably the first three series (middle ages, renaissance, enlightenment), while the last (WW I) is okay, and the stand-alone was not the best.That stated, you'll watch this over and over as the lines Atkinson delivers are some of the best written."
5,Good Job,"This was an excellent transaction. The product came faster than anticipated and in perfect condition. It's a great series and will make an even better gift. If you enjoy weird humor and crazy similies, this is the show for you."
3,Transfer could have been better,"I ordered this and the Ab Fab Collectors Set.Ab Fab was perfect! The transfer and compression left nothing to be desired.Unfortunately I can not say the same for Black Adder, although sound is exceptional, the disc displayed visual artifacts from either the source media they used, or the compression level.It may be that TAPE was used to create Black Adder, and Ab Fab was shot on FILM, but still I was let down.If you are fan you will enjoy the details presented on the characters and actors. The Fifth Series as mentioned before was a special for TV and not a whole series of episodes as the previous four were.The Cavalier Years is a delight to see (I had read the script years ago), but again, the quality was not up to my expectations of a DVD.Compare the image of Black Adder Back and Forth, (This looks like the only one shot on FILM to me) to the rest of the series. For under ... you get all of Black Adder on a convenient format.Is it worth it?Yes."
5,5 star all the way,"Maybe it takes a certain mental makeup to fully appreciate how wonderfully funny Black Adder is. What Frank Zappa called "" a well defined sense of the bizarre"". And I suppose we should be grateful for those who don't get it as it creates a category for the rest of us to feel specialized in.There's a 1 star review somewhere in this mass of positivism from a guy in Germany. One wishes for a way to e-mail him Basil Fawlty . But what can you expect from a country that loves David Hasselhoff."
5,Best humor to sail the Atlantic via Curtis & Elton..,"comes from Mr. Bean, himself. While my nine-year-old daughter is enjoying Bean, I prefer Black Adder's second season. Buy this package instead of doling out over $100 purchasing all of the discs under seperate cover.Blackadder's Christmas Carol is especially humorous, with Adder exhibiting a polar opposite of his usual sarcastic character until the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present & Future pays him a visit. He learns being bad can be so good.It's a shame here in the states, Atkinson is better known for his Bean character rather than his work on these releases.For you Young Ones fans, there are quite a few appearances by Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer & Adrian Edmondson.Nice package!"
5,Cunning,"This is, for any Blackadder fan, the absolute, ultimate, and last compilation you'd ever want. All episodes are there and some (although not an awful lot) extra materials.The show, as you probably know, is brilliant. Actually getting better as the series moves on, right up to and including the thought provoking ending of series 4. The performances of the entire cast is absolutely wonderful. For ""House, M.D."" fans there is an opportunity to see a pre-House Hugh Laurie in the role of many a gormless upper class Englishman.Highest possible recommendation."
5,Forget Mr. Bean - this is how Rowan Atkinson should be seen,Found out about Blackadder about 5 years ago. This is how Rowan Atkinson should be seen. Mr. Bean is sorely lacking in comparison. Atkinson's wit and acting (and most importantly the cynicism and sarcasm) are terrific. I don't think I can compare any British comedy to this one. Truly a work of art.
5,Timeless comedy,"Blackadder is one of the most original and timeless comedy acts ever made. Rowan Atkinson is probably one of the best comedians of the century. This pack which completes the whole Blackadder series spans across English history with Black adder and Baldrick;s intervention. A funny look at history and good scenario comedy. Because the stories are interesting they can be watched over and over again. Black adder the fourth is my favourite, ""Good luck with those elephants"", pure class!"
5,A Unique.,"Black Adder, in sequential episodes from the medieval to World War I and beyond,is like nothing you've seen before. Words and action are elaboratly mounted,sophisticated, acerb, elegantly rude and achingly funny.Nearby comments on Monty Python apply here and as well to Fawlty Towers.Love one, you'll love all three."
5,"A ""Must Own"" for fans of witty, British comedy","I am not going to ramble on about this series, suffice to say that it remains one of the finest written comedy's of our time, and a tribute to the sheer brilliance of Elton and Curtis. It is not for all tastes, it is dark, witty comedy and those who crave only the contemporary, such as Friends or Frasier should leave well alone, but for those who enjoy absolute quality and classic comedy, this is the ultimate collection to own. If in doubt - buy it anyway, you won't regret it!"
5,But if she sees his head on a spike . . .,". . . she'll realize that he's DEAD! But I digress. I do disagree with some viewers - I think the Forth is the weakest series but I may be simply prejudiced against this dreary century. I believe it's part of the cunning plan that the Edmunds become less stupid as they become less rich. I'm familiar with PM Pitt, but what about Lady Hamilton? The scary thing is that I actually find Black Adder II attractive!"
5,The definitive collection,"I was worried when this was released that the quality would be awful, or it wouldn't contain absolutely every piece of Black adder history. Not a bit of it!The quality of the transfer is excellent. Viewing it on a US TV to me is like seeing it again in all its UK PAL 625 line glory! It looks perfect.Also, everything is here. Series 1,2,3,4 and the one-off Black adder 5 movie, the Christmas special (in itself a brilliant episode) and even the Red Nose day special ""Black adder: The Cavalier years"".Now, if they can only do the same thing for ""Red Dwarf""..."
4,A great show in a crummy package,This show is one of the best of the Brit coms. The way they have packaged it however is another story. Do the makers of theses packages ever actually try to use them? I'm sure not. The five disc set is packaged on 3 holders. No not one by it's self and two discs on opposite sides of swinging leaf pages. That would have made some sense. What they have done is stacked the discs on each other. You say you want to watch Blackadder the third. Then you have to take out Blackadder II and hold it (or lay it down somewhere) while you get out the disc you want. The discs are stacked in a staggered fashion on one another. No protection for them at all. The manufacturers of this and all DVD's should stop trying to save an extra 3 cents per package and place these discs in the package in a manor that is protective for the disc and convenient for the people who will be using them.
4,Funnier than Mr. Bean?!?,"A great discovery! I've seen some of Rowan Atkinson's stand-up and of course Mr. Bean, but this series show the comedy genius of Mr. Atkinson. My favorite would be the fourth series. It reminds me of my time during bivouacs, just funnier. Great ending to the series!My one complaint, there aren't any more series to watch!"
5,"Wibble, turnips, little goblin feet","If you like your humor sharp of tongue and intellect, you will love Black Adder...Black Adder....wickedly good!"
5,Brit Com at its best!,"Blackadder is a necessary, if not the necessary, British comedy television show to watch. Pure cunning, dry wit, and ruthless sarcasm abound in this set containing all episodes of the series."
5,Historic Fun,"This is my favorite amongst many excellent BBC television series. I heartily recommend it, easily Rowan Atkinson's best work. Many of England's historical figures are at the receiving end of Rowan's sly, evil wit as the series jumps from one era to another. The supporting cast is also very talented."
5,I have a cunnning plan....To buy these DVDs!,"The BlackAdder series has got to be one of the best comedic products of the BBC since Monty Python. The characters begin in early history and work their way through to World War I, all the time making the kinds of clever word puns and intellectual jokes that Rowan Atkinson is famous for, sprinkled with other ""less than intellectual"" jokes as well for good measure. Each episode is side-splittingly funny. Atkinson's Edmund BlackAdder is a particularly sardonic and amusing personality sketch, but also equally enjoyable are characters like Baldrick, the hygiene-deprived servant, and George, the bumbling friend unfairly put in positions of power higher than that of Edmund. I have watched these episodes again and again. I never tire of them, and find myself and my family quoting them quite often. As Baldrick would say, ""I have a cunning plan..."" Top quality humor. Absolutely worth it."
5,British comedy at its best!,"We lived in England for six years and fell in love with Black Adder. In fact, we've watched the tapes so much they have started to wear out. I will say that British Comedy is an acquired taste and the First series of Black Adder is probably the weakest. For someone who has never seen the series, I would recommend starting with the third series where he is a Butler to the Prince Regent. Every episode in that series is fantastic. As for the Christmas episode, you really have to have watched the others in the series to fully follow it. Alot of the humor is topical to Enlgland for example the episode that deals with a member of Parliment called ""Pit the Younger"" and for fun they added, Pit the Toddler, Pit the Infant, and Pit the Glint in the Milkmans Eye. It would help to know who Pit the Younger was.But, all that said, I would, and have, recommended buying these tapes to anyone who truly loves good comedy."
5,A History of Ye Olde Englande.,"Here ye here ye.I do declare that this be the finest history of ye merry olde enlande ye can finde.Anyway, that's enough of that!The finest, most hilarious, wacky, sinical comedy of the last 500 years!!!Buy it!!!"
2,Not nearly as good as The Thin Blue Line,"We adore the Rowan Adkinson series, The Thin Blue Line, so looked foward with anticipation to seeing Black Adder. It has it's moments, but we did not enjoy it nearly as much. It is just a little too off-the-wall and ridiculous in parts."
2,Way over-hyped - not very funny,"I really loved Rowan as Mr. Bean, and was excited to hear the great reviews about Black Adder. I found this entire series very unfunny however. Rowan is actually funny as Mr. Bean; as the Black Adder, he's just a smug, disinterested jerk who points out how stupid his companions are. All the jokes seemed exactly the same - someone makes some idiotic, stupid remark, and Black Adder rolls his eyes and says how stupid the person is. I just don't find that funny."
1,Can you say Sweat shop,"For the price I paid for the sheets and comfortor, I could have gotten a really nice set at the store. The sheets are see through and rough, the blanket is nothing but a cheap piece of foam with some fabric sewn around it. I am very very dissapointed. The company made a big big buck off of me with this set. never again. They must have made a 60 dollar profit, because what they sent me looks like it only cost 5 dollars to make."
1,Poor Quality. Save Your Money!!!!!,"I wish I had read some of the reviews for this product before I bought it. I was SO disappointed with the quality of the product. The sheets are extremely rough, thin and scratchy. The comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one. Since Thomas the Tank Engine is such a popular character, I would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it's trademark. As such, I am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding."
4,Kid's favorite train,"I have to admit I was pleasantly surprized to find that the comfortor & sheets were so nice. They were very colorful & seem like they will hold up well against the hard play of a two-year-old & his 4-year-old brother! When they opened the boxes & saw Thomas they opened the package right away & played with them like tents & played tug of war for HOURS & the sheets didn't seem to mind. My great-grandsons both like Thomas but one has a twin bed, the other a full-size so finding something for the both of them was difficult. But, once agian, Amazon made my life easy - just got on line & there they were - two different styles for the different sized beds!"
3,Cute but scratchy,Very cute set but sheets were super scratchy even after a few washings and lots of fabric softner.
4,really cute,"My son loves it. It is not very soft, but my son doesn't even notice. Very vivid colors and design."
5,Happy customer,"My son wanted this Webkinz for his birthday, and I could not find it in the stores. When I ordered online, the price was great - even better than the stores and I got free shipping. Once ordered, my shipment came very quickly. I would definitely order from here again."
4,Webkinz Gorilla,This is a great collectible Gorilla. Purchased for my grandson for Christmas. Didn't think would find since no longer make. Gave it to him early and his face was worth it all. From Beanie Babies to Webkinz....who knows what's next....Would recommend Webkinz products.
4,The Millionth Circle,I don't know why I cannot finish this book. I love the idea of circles and spreading good and higher energy into this poor world of ours.
4,Challenging,"I am a fan of Dr. Bolen and she has not disappointed me yet. I would like to be a member of a circle, but find it a little daunting. Still, well worth the read."
1,"A lot of fluff, not much substance! Very disappointing.","As a fan of Jean Shinoda Bolen's previous work, I found this book to be extremely disappointing. It is what I would call ""spiritual-lite."" As one who has studied and used the circle a great deal in the last five years, I am amazed at how ""lite"" this work is. Not much of any substance is found in the history of using the circle, nor of how to use it effectively and practically in day to day life or in business. A MUCH better circle book is Christina Baldwin's groundbreaking work, ""Calling the Circle."" Which interestingly enough, Jean Shinoda Bolen herself RECOMMENDS as a ""truly wise guide"" on the back cover of ""Calling the Circle"", as well as with a much more indepth quote of support on the inside front cover of CTC. Very interesting to me, as she didn't cite or credit Ms. Baldwin's work at all. Or any other current circle guidebooks for that matter...and there are much better ones out there than this! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,"A brilliant, merciless eyewitness report from a participant","A brilliant and merciless eyewitness report from one who was there. By just reporting what he saw and felt, E.B. Sledge tells us what war is really like and through his eyes we are able to see the horrid ugliness of the savagery called war. It is a homage to all the U.S. servicemen who fought for our country and all I can say to Mr. Sledge and his comrades in arms is ""Thank you"". This book is a must for anyone who desire to know the true meaning of war, as known to those who actually participate"
5,classic,After watching the mini series &reading the book i would suggest other readers to watch the series so as to assimilate the caracter from the series to the book. a brilliant read.
5,With the Old Breed,E.B.Sledge offers the reader a first-hand account of a front line Marine in the Peleliu and Okinawa campaigns against entrenched Japanese troops. His description of life and death from within a division which suffered over 150% cascualties is unsurpassed with realism.The author compliments his memoir with footnotes of historical details while retaining the simplicity of his personal account of the campaigns from the eyes of a PFC out in front against an enemy force which is determined to fight to the death. With the Old Breed is recommended for those who which to learn the truth of War of the Pacific against the Japanese without ommiting the horrors and realism of warfare.
5,Superb History,"Eugene Sledge's vivid first hand accounts of the battles for Peleliu and Okinawa. If your interest is WWII history, the war in the Pacific, or Marine Corps history, this book is essential. Sledge portrays combat in the pacific so well the reader is right beside Sledge, enduring the hot humidity of Peleliu, the cold rain of Okinawa, and the fear and horror of war. A superb book.German Paratroops in North Africa: Tropical Uniforms, Headgear, and Insignia of the Fallschirmjager in World War II"
5,"Excellent Book, Could not put it down","This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written extremely well. I had trouble putting the book down. This book describes in great detail the horrors and hardships that the Marines faced in WWII during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa from a grunt Marine's perspective. After reading this book, you will have a genuine appreciation for the sacrifices made by the young men, many in their teens, who fought one of the most horrific campaigns in U.S. military history. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our WWII veterans as well as all other veterans who have served our country and have fought to keep our freedom."
5,Incomparable,"There are numerous written accounts from the infantryman's point of view of the Pacific theater of War. Sledge's masterpiece,is without equal, it draws you back again and again, not for the brutal horror of the experiences, but more to share in the search for humanity and meaning to where none seems to reside. The humor is there as it's own defense mechanism and moments of comfort are fleeting."
5,The Real Story of the South Pacific War,"This book tells the true story of how the grunt soldiers won the Pacific war and the horrible conditions and heartbreak they had to endure as cannon-fodder. As a teenager, I worked for a guy in Mobile, AL who was a Marine Raider in the Pacific in WWII and the descriptions in this book mirror some of the horror he used to describe when he had too much to drink (like many, it was the only time he would ever talk about it). Prepare yourself for the horrors and agony of the real Pacific war and the brutality of the Japs. If I hadn't heard it from my boss/friend first, it would be hard to believe. Believe it! It's worth every line to read."
5,One of the best WWII Autobiographies.,Great book. read it 12 years ago and it still stands out as one of my all time favorite WWII Autobiographies.
5,With the greatest,"With the Old Breed is a simple and very entertaining read! The book provides an insight of the horrors the marines had to face as they took the relentless, stubborn, and evil Japanese army. Sledge manages to create a master piece that gives any reader a reason to honor the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to stop tranny and oppression from form winning."
4,This Text is a No-Nonsence I was there.,"This is the first book I have read about the War in the Pacific as faced by the Marines but what I have heard about this theater previously was put into even more harsh words from a participant (Sledge). This text is definately easy to read, Sledge is not a very verbose person, but this makes the book quite enjoyable and I have had problems putting it down since I picked it up. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Pacific Theather."
4,Excellent Insight,"Of the many books on the various battles between the US and its enemies, only those written from participants provide a true insight into the conflict. In fact, usually the best books are not written by those behind the lines calling the shots, but those who were on the front lines. Indeed, I had previously heard of the many atrocities committed by the Japanese on both civilians and combatants, but to hear first hand about what certain US troops did during and after the heat of battle was sadly educative. This book is recommended reading for anyone interested in what the Greatest Generation accomplished and it certainly made me more appreciative for our current freedom in this great country. God bless the USA."
4,A great book telling us about the sacrifice of men,"What a great book into the life of our grandfathers who served the U.S. on the front lines of WWII. I'm honored to know servicemen today, who carry on the tradition, and fight for our country. This is a great book, and shows the sacrifice our country and individuals have made for us."
5,With the Old Breed,"If you are a person who is a big fan of history, war, blood and gore, you will love this book. With The Old Breed by E.B. Sledge is an autobiography about Sledge's life in the war against the Japanese in World War II. If this book were a movie, it would have 5 stars and would be rated R for blood, gore, and language. Sledge fought with the Marines in some of the biggest battles of World War II, Peleliu and Okinowa. In Peleliu he saw many gruesome wounds and deaths. Peleliu made him tired mentally and physically. In Okinowa it rained a lot and it was really muddy. In Okinowa people lost their lives and many were wounded. E.B. sledge described the action very well. He also talked in depth about the campaigns that they did. Sledge writes in first person because it is about himself, ""Yeah,"" I said, ""and I'm not in any hurry, either."" That was a quote from the book. Review by Tyler S."
5,Incredibly touching,"World War 2 is probably the most recited, documented, re-created (film), and discussed war in the history of this planet. Yet I have to say that not all WWII stories can match the genuine, touching, and brutally honest rendition as Eugene Sledge has captured here. As a Private with the Marines during the Pacific invasion, Sledge has put together a truly masterful book. It took him over 40 years to get the nerve to finally write down the horrors of his experience. But I promise, if you are a WWII enthusiast that craves first-person encounters from real front-line men (not officers or war writers), start off with this one by E.B. Sledge because you will thoroughly enjoy it. It is eye-opening and captivating."
5,Great Story of WWII Marines in the Pacific,"EB Sledge has written a great book about a Marine's account in WWII Pacific as taken from his personal diary. A greta red about the tragedy of war, including the loss of human life. It is also an excellent history of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Pacific."
5,Straight shooting,Unemotional and balanced look by a gifted writer. It was a time of heroes. We can learn from this book.
5,Moving Story,This is one of the most moving stories of WWII that you will read. First hand accounts of what these brave men actually went through. Thanks a vet every time you see one! Book arrived right on time and in excellent condition.
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"I was very satisfied with the level of customer service that I received from Amazon.com. As a college student I am always looking for cheaper books, so this has become one of my new favorite websites."
3,How close to the front lines?,"This is a pretty well written book with some very good descriptions of combat, however I was unable to overcome a feeling that Sledge managed to avoid the serious front line combat the riflemen were going through. He always seemed to be behind the line lobbing morter shells while the other Marines were pinned down on the front lines. I don't mean any disrespect because I'm sure there were cooks getting killed on these islands. Just an observation"
5,"Much better than the ""movie""","After watching the HBO series ""The Pacific"" and being less than blown away (it was o.k., but no ""Band of Brothers""), I was left Eugene Sledge and a good friend of mine (a retired jar-head) recommended this book. It puts into words the real hell of war, you can almost imagine what these kids went through. I say almost, because when you read his graphic depiction of his experiences in the pacific war, a part of you wants to believe that it's been embellished, but in your heart you know that bad memories fade and the reality of E.B's war was probably much worse."
5,With the Old Breed.,It was very well written. It kept me on the edge of my seat and was hard to put the book down. It was especially interisting to me as my uncle served with them.
5,Must reading for chicken hawks,"I ordered With the Old Breed from Amazon after watching Ken Burns' work on World War IIand seeing the first installments of Pacific on HBO. Eugene B. Sledge is featured in bothproductions. Sledge's treatment of the war in the Pacific hit home for me because my fatherserved as a Seabee in the Solomon Islands. This book is very honest and reflects the horrorsof war and what human beings are capable of under extreme conditions. This book should be mustreading for all Americans who so easily send young men and women off to die in war. The book bolsters myconviction that a draft is needed when the president declares war. If every young man and womanwould be eligible to serve and die to defend our nation, the Senators would be much less willingto see their ""Senator's Sons"" go off to war. Perhaps we would begin the task of finding other meansshort of violence to work out our differences."
5,Heartbreaking Account,"This should be required reading for all politicians making any decisions about war.For every citizen, in fact.I read it with frequent, moist eyes.The first hand account reveals the real uselessness of war...far different than the ""grand"" historical overview.Now I know why the REAL soldiers in combat never wanted to talk about what happened to noncombatants.How could one believe that such inhumanity even existed?I am humbled by the sacrifice these people endured."
5,The BEST War Book I Have Ever Read!,"I read this book about six moths prior to the HBO series ""The Pacific"" that is partially based on this book. While ""The Pacific"" was very good in my opinion, it does not do justice to WTOB by Sledge.This has things about what Sledge and his fellow Marines went through on Peleliu and Okinawa that will make anyone shudder at the horror that war really is.This book WILL absolutely send shivers down your spine..."
5,uncommon valor,"I first read this book some years ago, when it was out of print but still recognized by many as a first rate journal of man and war. I trust the HBO series will keep it back in print for many years to come. Sledge tells his story with a deep sense of humility and respect. The violence and terror of Peleleui and Okinawa are palpable through his unembellished prose style. There is no literary enhancement here, no exaggeration, because none is necessary. It leaves readers to marvel at the good fortune of the United States, to be defended by ordinary men who are called upon to engage in extraordinary and dehumanizing acts of selflessness."
5,Best war book ever!,"A very graphic yet human interpretation of the war. There are some fascinating looks into the darkest recesses of a man's psyche during the most grueling and sickening moments of warfare. Definitely worth the read for any WW2 or war buff in general, as well as any student of humanity."
5,truly a semper-fi read!,"one of 3books that seem to have been used as source materials byd by the screenwriters ofthegreat wwII movie ""the thin red line.. the other 2 were apparentlywilliam manchester's memoir ""goodbye darkness and'"" battle-cry"" by leon uris.... both also excellentmarine stories as well."
5,Excellent read for history buffs,This book is truely written in the prospective of the common soldier. It is unbelievable what they delt with. Mr Sledge is a true hero.
4,World War II memories,"My father (now 92) fought at both Pelileu and Okinawa, as did the author Eugene Sledge. Despite the fact that his generation rarely talks about WWII, he was thrilled to get this book and read it straight through.It's not only accurate, it is very moving. A great insider's look at two of the worst battles in the Pacific."
5,Vivid Telling of Brutal Battles,"Eugene Sledge takes us into the carnage and fear at Peleliu and Okinawa. His first-person account offers as close an idea of the horror of these places as anything I've read. Although he gives due credit to the ""Old Breed"" Marines that made up the personality of the units, he also cooly recounts the everyday, mostly overlooked, bravery of the younger NCOs, junior officers and replacements. It rates with the best small unit autobiographies of World War II."
4,Tough book,"Guite hard trip to the pacific, exellent book! Hard to read english but i got the idea of the story, fast and trustable delivery, thanks..."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This harrowing account is by far the best I have read on the battle for Peleliu. I spent a lot of time on Peleliu when I was working as a diving instructor in Palau. Today, the jungles have overgrown the entire area that was burned and blown into a desolate landscape during the battle. From the top of China Wall, it is hard to find a viewpoint to see the areas where all the intense action was. However, all the artifacts remain. Planes, tanks, guns, live ammunition, and Japanese skeletons can still be found in the caves and undergrowth. Without a book like this, it would be impossible to fully imagine the horrors of battle that occurred in the now peaceful jungle."
5,One of the classic books on the military experience,"This book is not to be missed. This is one of the few works that approach Guy Sajer's magnificent work FORGOTTEN SOLDIER. Anton Myrer's ONCE AN EAGLE comes close. As an exMarine myself, this book redefines the notion of glorious combat. Mr. Sledge's obvious intelligence shows how necessary a military draft is to having a force truly representing the people. Read also Michael Herr's DISPATCHES."
5,War story,Also gave this as gift to my husband. He is interested in anything that has to do with the wars. Good read.
4,With the Old Breed,"this book is for a very small selection of readers. The book tells a story that is gruesome and brutal. The story is about a young US Marine with an honest portral of war. If any criticism is to be made, the book is to honest. The young Marine talks about being scared and the horrible stench of the dead to excessive degrees but I have no doubt of the truth in that."
5,with the old breed,This is a story of the suffering and hardship of Pvt Sledge during the battle of Peleliu and Okinawa.The Peleliu campaign was a blood bath and the island was never used after this great battle and sacrifices of the Marines who gave the life.Pvt Sledges gives an first hand account from a mortarmen with the 1st Marine Division in both of these great and costly battles.
4,With The Old Breed,"A terrific read,very descriptive in it's content.If your into the battles for the Pacific Islands then this is the book for you."
5,OUTSTANDING!! read,"This is an OUTSTANDING BOOK, true and real. A good read. Any combat vet will see themselves. You will enjoy it."
4,Old Breed,"Outstanding account of the horrors of war faced by infantrymen. Not a historical sweep with a tactician's view of the consequences of campaigns. This a story written by a PFC in the trenches. Sledge is able to articulate horrible conditions such as battlefield corpses and human waste issues in extreme heat on a rock island with no sanitation, and yet he does so in a manner that is informative without turning off the reader. As in all good books, you keep turning the pages and when its over you wish there was more. You wonder how his return to civilian life went, but he does not go into detail about that. What you are left with is the image of thousands of deeply scarred individuals returning to a society unaware of their damage and of no agency prepared to help them re-integrate. Highly recommend this book to any history buff."
5,GREAT BOOK!,WWII as it really was in the Pacific! I could almost feel the bullets and shrapnel. High recommend!
5,Best war book I've ever read.,"I've read a number of WWII books. With The Old Breed was different, a first hand account of the guys in the mud, stench of dead bodies, barbarism of the enemy, harrible casualty rates,etc.. Could not put it down."
4,the view from the prone position,"Stick your head up, you die. The descriptions here assault all your senses. The definitive story from a front line marine. It ain't pretty. It will shock some. But it is what happened."
5,A must read for Marines and history buffs,Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. Sledge captures the gritty reality of combat and the subtle nuances of being a United States Marine. Our generation is twice indebted to Professor Sledge- for his courageous service and for his outstanding account of the horrors of war. Semper Fi Sledgehammer.
5,With the Old Breed,This book is about the WWII. We were watching a program on TV & this book was named so I looked up on Amazon.com to see if we could buy it was it was published about 50 years ago. It is a Christmas present for my husband and I can see him not putting it down until finished. My husband is looking forward to reading it. Thank you Amazon.com for having this book in stock.
4,With The Old Breed,"Never spent much time reading books, but this was a exception. I usually wait until the movie comes out to watch. Very good, enjoyed it."
5,Profound,This book should be required reading by every high school student in the United States. Wonderfully written by a true American Hero.
5,Best personal war memories of a simple soldier,"I read and continue reading many books about the Second World War, but never a so complete, dramatic and astonishingly real personal description of the heroism, but also the savagery, the dirtyness, the uglyness, the sadness and the seemengly unsurmontable difficulties and suffering war means to a simple Infantry soldier -- in this case, an Infantry Marine.And Sledges's book is also of great literaty value, also."
5,Smell the Smoke...Hear the Shells.....Witness the Carnage...,"Without doubt, the finest first person account of battlefield life that I have ever read. Period."
5,With the Old Breed by E. B. Sledge,"Recommended by Nathaniel Ficke, author of ""One Bullet Away,"" and it is one of the most compelling war biographies I have ever read. His humanity couldn't be overwhelmed by the ""abyss"" of combat."
5,The best book I have ever read!,"I am not an avid book reader and it usually takes me a long time to finish a book but I could not put this book down. It is written like the average person wrote it, I didn't have to look up any words in the dictionary which made it a very easy read. The story flowed seamlessly and was easy to follow along and visualize as you read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know about or is curious about the reality of war."
5,With The Old Breed excellent!,"Having seen Ken Burns films on WWII and his mention of this book, I decidedto read it. I was not disappointed. Ordinarily I don't like works like thisbut Sledge handled his on-the-ground experiences in the Pacific with simplicitybut with elequence. I was very impressed with the book, moved and sometimesshattered by the bravery and determination of our troups. It makes forexciting reading, if you're inclined to know what war was like then, andprobably what war is still like for men and women on the ground now. Read it!You won't be disappointed."
5,EXTREMELY POWERFUL AND REAL,"THANK YOU, MR. SLEDGE, FOR WRITING THIS BRILLIANT MEMOIR OF PACIFIC COMBAT IN WW II...I'M A MARINE CORPS INFANTRYMAN MYSELF (IN IRAQ FOR THE THIRD TIME NOW), AND THIS BOOK, ALONG WITH JAMES WEBB'S FIELDS OF FIRE, ARE THE TWO MOST DEAD-ON ACCURATE DEPICTIONS OF THE DAILY LIFE OF THE MARINE CORPS GRUNT IN COMBAT. MR. SLEDGE DESCRIBES THE HELLISH ENVIRONMENT SO ACCURATELY THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WALKING THE PATROL RIGHT BESIDE HIM. MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE DESCRIBES HOW THE INFANTRYMAN HOLDS ONTO THE TINIEST, MOST OBSCURE IMAGES OF PEACE AND HUMANITY DURING COMBAT. I, ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER GRUNTS, KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE BEAUTY OF THE LAND AND THE SCENERY DURING THE LULLS IN THE BATTLE. THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU THROUGH....THAT AND THE UNBELIEVABLE BROTHERHOOD BETWEEN MARINES ON THE GROUND. MR. SLEDGE'S MEMOIR IS TIMELESS, AND IS THE WORK OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE. IT WAS AN HONOR FOR ME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ HIS WORDS."
4,"With the Old Breed, Sledge","I would have given this book 5 stars if the detail provided about Peleliu had been the same for Okinawa. I ordered this book because of a conversation I had with a veteran of both battles. This veteran is Jack Vargo, PFC with the 1st Marines.(or maybe the amphib force, I'm not sure.)I was a little unhappy with the Okinawa portion because I was stationed there from 1961 to 1963 ( and ,incidentally made my first mission into Vietnam on 2 Jan 1962) and saw many of the shore battery positions and walked the coral bottoms of the cliffs where so many Japanese and Okinawans committed suicide by jumping off.In support of the book, Jack commented that Sledge had definitely got the facts right. Particularly the part about the flies clinging to you so thick that you had to scrape them off.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone for its historical basis and it is now in my library in that section.Sincerely,R.P. TaylorMAJ (ret) USA"
4,Straight forward harrowing account of war against Japan,"Sledge's book is a must-read for anyone interested in WWII battles against the Japanese. No words are wasted trying to impress the reader. Instead, this is a first-hand account of an enlisted soldier's harrowing battle experiences. It does not get any more personal and straight forward than this. The maps in the book are not very good, so I turned to the internet. I Googled every mountain, island, ship name, etc. for an immersing reading experience. You can even use Microsoft's Flight Simulator to fly around the islands."
4,A personal account of war in the Pacific from a Marine who was there,"Sledge's writing is without guile or artistic embellishment. He tells his view of the battles simply and clearly and he reveals all the horror, brutality and waste of war. For those unfamiliar with how vicious the fighting was in the Pacific, this is a great primer. Many know of the bloody fight for Okinawa and there is much personal detail here on that battle. Few know of Peleliu because it turned out to be of little strategic value. Even so, one month of fighting cost the Marines & Army nearly 10,000 casualties. The battle was important to the Marines in that they learned to adapt to the new, more lethal tactics the Japanese tried there.If you are looking for a novel or a historical text, this is not the book for you. If you want to become more intimately familiar with the nature of the fighting in the Pacific, you will not find a better book."
5,The Pacific with E.B. Sledge,"To prepare myself for the HBO Series The Pacific I obtained a copy of this novel and was shocked at how horrible this war front really was. A vivid account of E.B. Sledge's Pacific wars and brutal imagery to paint those gripping strugles you almost feel like you are there next to Sledgehammer. Based off of notes kept in secret written in his bible gives you personal views of what went through this soldiers mind in the toughest of battles. Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow subs nicknames for the soldiers in his novel Sledge uses actual names so if and when you compare the journals of Sledge to the HBO The Pacific you want be disappointed. Sledge's use of imagery in his telling almost makes you feel the mud on your skin, the smell that hangs in the air, and feel the hoplessness of each battle. A great historical document that many should cherish least we forget!"
5,This is the best book ever written by an American Combat Veteran,"This book is about combat. Nothing more. It is horrifying. It is well written. It is too well written. If you read this book, you will understand combat. Not ""war"", but combat. That's Mr. Sledge's goal. He wants the rest of us to understand the horror of combat. This is the best book on combat by an American combat veteran. The only combat book that is better is ""The Forgotten Soldier"" by Guy Sajer, a German soldier on the Russian front during WWII. Both of these books will make you cry like a baby. Read them back to back & I promise that you will have nightmares."
5,Eugene Sledge's own story,"This is the finest personal war memoir I have ever read, made more significant by the kind of Pacific campaign Sledge and his Marine comrades had to endure. Small wonder the book has never gone out of print since it was first published."
5,The Pacific War Embedded in the Author's Memories,"This is a book that should be read along with Robert Leckie'sHelmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific. Sledge covers his experiences prior to volunteering for the US Marine Corps, boot camp, and the battles he experienced in the pacific war. One difference between this book and Helmet for My Pillow: Leckie's book came out in 1947, while Sledge's book came out in 1981. So, I thought Leckie's writing reveals how close in time the war was to him, while Sledge's book reflects the reality of the war that was embedded in his memory. Also, Sledge missed the early part of the Pacific War, while Leckie missed the latter part. Both are excellent books."
5,Absolutely great!,"I enjoy first-hand accounts of what the war was actually like, and this is the best book I've read along those lines. What comes across after a while is that there are just no words to adequately descibe the feelings, emotions, and sights that these men had to come to grips with and endure. It is also very good at describing what it's like to hump ammo and supplies through the mud as part of the day to day routine of a frontline Marine, and having to forgo sleep and food for days on end if you wanted to survive. Things like that, that are never mentioned in other books or movies, are what make this book unique. You definitely won't be disapointed with this well written personal account of hell on earth. I've given 2 copies as gifts since reading it."
5,Fantastic book,This is a fabulous first-person account of the later campaigns in the Pacific theater of WWII. I'd recommend it to anyone interested.
5,The real deal in Pacific War books,"I read this book as one of three. I enjoyed watching the HBO/Playtone series ""The Pacific"" this spring. So, I read this book, plus two others to get more of the story. It is always difficult to get a feel when we only get one episode a week for 10 weeks. The books help. The other two are, ""I'll Stay With My Boys"" (about Medal of Honor winner Sgt. John Basilone) and ""My Helmet for My Pillow."" All three were used as a basis for the series and all three are excellent. After reading all three I will never ever complain about hardship again. These men that fought for our freedom and to defend our country were more than men. They were heros that endured hardships that we will never know about."
5,Fantastic book,"A very realistic book, it takes all the glamour of war that you see in the movies, and make you face the gore, the horror, the cruelty of true war. Fantastic book."
4,Familiar,The details and thoughts of E. B. Sledge is that of similarity of my experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq. Very well put together book it explains so civilians but a lil to much for those of us serving in the military but fascinating to see how the phrases of Marines change over generations but the meaning is still the same.
5,fantastic,This is a great book! Its hard to put down. If you want to read about a real hero pick this up
3,Manowar Like Band,"hey I just tryed the mp3 Im a half Power metal fan. They sound just like Manowar. It was a lil light for power metal. Then againg I am a Darkseed & Cradle Of Filth fan so everything sounds light. I don't Know all Power metal sounds sissy. But if you like the following band by this to show that mp3 sampling works ok Iron Madien, Manowar, Stratovarious, or Dream Evil. k"
4,Superb book!,"This book really is as good as everyone says in their reviews. The only reason I marked it down to 4 stars was because I found the reading (not the content) a long hard slog. I found myself reading only a few pages at a time because it was like walking through knee deep sludge - hard work! This is mainly because it is written using very old-fashioned English terminology and style of presentation (of course it is, being written in the 20s) and it can be difficult to follow because of that. Content wise, well, I am using my new found knowledge now and working on my own OOBE and having some success at the early stages - still a way to go yet. To sum up? WORTH EVERY CENT - BUY IT!"
5,Book that influenced many others that followed,"Simply put, an excellent book! I read many other books on Astral Projection (Monroe, Bruce, Peterson, Buhlman) before I read Muldoon's which was written decades ago. I found it surprising how many concepts were discussed in Muldoon's work and how much this influenced the later studies on Astral Projection. This is the book that opened up the gate to understanding astral projection."
5,The classic OOB book,Anyone remotely interested in astral projection or out of the body phenomena has to familiarise themselves with this acknowledged classic on the topic. Muldoon inspired interest in this fascinating experience to a wide public audience when the first edition was published in 1929. There may be better books written with up to date materialbut this book is the first to gointo extensive detail . Highly recommended. It takes a lot of beating.
5,Proyeccion astral . Experiencias personales autor,"Es un magnifico libro , el mejor que conozco sobre la proyeccion astral . Es ""el Clasico"" dentro de la literatura de proyeccion astral . Muy muy agradable de leer y muy sugerente .Solo trata de las experiencias personales de Muldoon , Carrington solo le ayudo a escribirlo . Este personaje tenia desde muy joven proyecciones astrales espontaneas , que consideraba normales hasta que con el tiempo descubrio lo extraordinaria que eran para el resto de mortales . Es un libro que data de hace bastantes decadas , lo dicho ""el Clasico"" dentro de la fenomenologia astral"
4,THE STORY OF THE ACADIANS,THIS IS A POEM AND IT IS SIMILAR TO EVANGELINE IN THAT IS SHOWS AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DISPLACED. HOWEVER THERE IS MUCH MISINFORMATION REGARDING WHO WENT WHERE. IT DOES NOT GIVE ANY POLITICAL INFO ABOUT THE ENGLISH FRENCH AND SPANISH WHO ALL WERE IN THE VICINITY OF NEW ORLEANS AT THE TIME. IT IS A SIMPLE STORY AND A GOOD READ
2,Not much meat,"This is a really thin ""poem"" that comes across as very basic and unprofessional. It isn't really worth reading or paying for."
1,Purchase something else......,"IF you are hearing impaired, this phone will not help you at all. The volume is too low and the boost button did not work at all. Item was returned."
1,Bad Phone,"I bought this phone for my mother who has a mild hearing problem. I tested the phone for the volume amplification, ""Clarity Boost"" and ringer signal amplification. There was constant buzzing sound in the backgroud. I could hear my own voice amplified while talking, that felt like being in a big empty room. The volume control and ""Clarity Boost"" made some difference, but the whole experience was so annoying that I decided to return the phone."
2,Not a great phone,"Clunky and awkward. From an audio standpoint, did not perform as well as I had hoped. Did not seem to actually amplify volume. I should have paid attention to the other poor Amazon ratings for this thing!"
5,"Easy to use, great volume, love those big buttons!","I just purchased this telephone for my husband, who has suffered mild hearing loss. He usually can barely hear the telephone ring, but not with this one. The flashing light is also very helpful and with his big hands, he is very pleased with the large buttons. For him, this is an all-around great telephone."
1,returned because not happy,The handset was not erconomically comfortable to handle (quiet large and heavy) Volume on other end of the call was too low. Volume on my end was OK. There are newer phones out there that do everything the Clarity C420 phone can do and better for a lower price. I returned it for a full refund.
4,Everything works well,"We bought this phone because we needed a 900mhz phone that would not interfere with the wireless internet in our house. The phone does not interfere with our wireless internet and the sound quality is good, not great, but totally acceptable."
5,CHILLING!,THE CRADLE WILL FALL IS THE THIRD MARY HIGGINS CLARK BOOK THAT I HAVE READ(THE OTHER TWO WERE MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU AND YOU BELONG TO ME). THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. IT IS VERY SUSPENSEFUL AND THE KILLER IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE MOST PSYCHOTIC VILLIANS I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOK! THIS BOOK IS REALLY GREAT. I TOTALLY RECOMMENED IT IF YOU WANT A VERY SUSPENSEFUL BOOK TO READ.
5,Review,"I have several books by Mary Higgins Clark. She has been one of my favorite authors for YEARS. I read her books over and over again, and even though I know the ending I still have a hard time putting the book down."
1,Not Worth the 25 cents I Paid for It,"I hated this. The heroine was weak and pathetic. The mystery could have been solved in five minutes if all the people involved had simply talked to each other and the police. It was very annoying watching all the characters stumble through their activities, the people running the investigation clumsily missing obvious clues and botching every interrogation. The concept of the doctor's experiments was far-fetched and of course everything was neatly tied up in the end in a very unrealistic fashion. I never liked Mary Higgins Clark and I don't know what possessed me to pick up this one except that I got it for $.25 at a used book sale. It wasn't worth the price"
5,"Intriguing, Suspenseful, and just plain out GREAT!!!!!","This was a very suspenseful but intriguing mystery novel! Not only did it get the detection juices flowing ,but also the survival instincts as well. It might have been better if the killer was not uncovered near the beginning of the book but rather near the end. Every time a new chapter was started there was another surprising turn of events just waiting for the reader. This gave it the suspense needed to hold the reader's attention. Also, changing places and stories each chapter made me want to keep reading so I could find out what was going to happen in one story, and then another story, and another, until I finally got to the end. It would have been nice to find out what happened between Katie and Richard after Katie had recovered from her near death experience, but it was also good to leave the reader making their own conclusions. I look forward to reading more of Mary Higgins Clark books in the future and so should you."
4,The first and the best!!!!,"Although I have been a faithful Mary Higgins Clark reader for over ten years now, The Cradle Will Fall has always been my favorite. It was the first MHC novel I read and I still get goosebumps thinking about this story. MHC is a fantastic writer who takes a common problem and puts an evil twist to it that most would never imagine, taking us into a whole new unexplored world. I read this home alone in the middle of the night and scared myself so much, I didn't sleep until dawn. Excellent read, just make sure you are prepared for your reaction!"
4,"Very good, but not my favorite","This book was the first book I read by Mary Higgins Clark, and I immediately wanted to read more. Her writing is so easy to read, and you are hooked by almost the first chapter. The characters are developed thorougly, and it's hard to put down. Though it is exciting, I will admit I was more intrigued by ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart."" You should check that one out before ""The Cradle Will Fall"" because I think the plot is a bit sneakier, and there's a major twist at the end. You know who the killer is the whole time in ""cradle"". Overall though, a great read."
5,I really want this,"I really like this thing because it is fun, you can play games on it, and it is exciting. And I really want one.I am 7 and ITsounds really nice."
1,"If you have not read the PDF manual first, don't buy it","I am a computer instructor and web page designer. I have tought many students various software programs. For best learning, a step by step process should be followed and no assumptions should be made about prior knowledge with the software. This book is poorly presented, makes assumptions of prior knowledge, and is hard to read.( Fonts, layout, general feel of the book) I would suggest that NOBODY BUY THIS BOOK until you have read the manual available on the macromedia site. Hopefully, by the time you read it there will be a better book available to you out there."
2,Poor book but it is the only reference to Flash aviable.,I have to say that if you buy this book you will be disappointed. You'd better trash your money in something else. The only thing that made me put 2 stars instead of one is that it is the only reference to Flash now. Still you may learn more using and reading the tutorials than reading this book.
2,only scratches the surface,"The book fails to discuss the most powerful aspect of Flash 3, tell target commands. However, I ultimately found the Macromedia printed manual, online tutorial, and website resources to be the best source of information regarding this simple but effective application. In conclusion, don't waste your money on Flash 3! Creative Web Animation."
2,A terrible resource for Flash 3 creation.,"Please, please, read this book BEFORE you consider buying it. It has to be one of the worst references on the subject, owing it's marginal success to the fact that very few (if any up until this date) books have been written about Flash 3. Subscribe to the list-serv from the MM site. It'll do you more good than this book, unless you're an absolute beginner."
2,Good for beginers,"I was not really that impressed with this book. While it does cover the basics it does not go into advanced topic such as games or FS. If you are new to Flash or just haven't got much from the tutorials, this book might prove valuable to you. I does not go into complex animations and its animated button section could go into more depth. The Lessons on the CD seem as if they just threw them toghther in order to get the book out. Darrel Plant could have spent much more time writing this one. Why didn't he start writing this while FLASH3 was in production? I mean we had to wait months for this guide to come out and then they kept postponing it. One last thing, on the back of the book it says that Sound Edit 16 trial is included on the CD. I couldn't find it on mine. Overall I think they did not spend enough time developing this book or the CD for that matter"
2,disappointing,"if you bought the first version of this book, don't bother with this one!there is very little information about flash 3's new features. pop-up menus are not mentioned. i really wish it covered more intermediate level topics.i would add, that if you don't own the previous book, you will find this one helpful. it is a good introductory book if you don't know anything about flash. i did find a few errors though, and if you don't know flash, these could prove confusing.overall, the book seemed rushed."
1,The book that comes with the software is more informative!,This rates as one of the biggest wastes of money for ANY book that I have ever purchased. The book that comes with the software is better...AND IT'S FREE!
2,"This book just plainly isn't ""All you've been looking for"".","This book is such a disappointment... swf and Flash are supposed to get the web out of old, static html, and the program itself is a pioneer in that revolution. There is nothing ""creative"" in this book, the author has a reaaaaally boring style of writing, and the accompanying CD and illustrations are so cheesy that I always laugh when I remember a hippy guy from a chapter # 7 or something. However, this book DOES get you started in learning how to use Flash and it DOES cover basics. Overall, it was a disappointment. There are many, many tutorials on the net that have ""real life"" tutorials and people who actually use Flash on their web pages (including me) on a daily basis. if you buy this book , it won't be a total waste of money, but it won't be a great deal either."
1,This book has a good cover and that's about it!,"This was a joke, The graphics were lame, examples poor, ""hot tip"" commands were wrong. For a $30 book this was a letdown.I learned the basics, but I already knew the basics, just from playing with the program for a few hours. Over-promise...under-deliver.Could have been done much better. I really like and have enjoyed some of Mr. Plant's other publications."
1,THIS BOOK IS WORTHLESS!!!,"OK, people out there who own Macromedia's Flash........DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!....unless it is being sold for less than a buck. The author needs to learn some writing skills and some teaching skills. Trust me this book is very poorly done. I regret ever buying this book. Don't be the next one to regret your money."
1,A re-copy of the manual,"I bought this book thinking that I would learn something new. This book did not answer any of my questions. I might have learnt one thing from the book, but im sure i could have picked up the information from the web just as quickly and for no cost.. I dont reccomend this book. Just use your manual and help files.. and wait for a more detailed book."
1,A total waste of time!,"I'm furious that I wasted my money on this book. I completely went through the manual on Flash 3, and realized I needed something that explained ""Why"" is was doing the things it explained. So I bought this Flash 3 book in hopes that it would be the answer. If anything . . . I'm now more confused than ever!!! Only about 2% of the tutorials even work. Most of them leave you scratching your chin wondering what you did wrong. It was't until a coworker of mine did the very same tutorials, that I found out they're totally bogus! Didn't any quality control go into this publication before it was printed??? I'm SOOOOOO disappointed."
3,This book can help,"This book helps and really inforces the basic Flash funamentals and will get more beginners on the right track.If your lost in Flash's interface, don't know what layers are, and learn a few things about animation, this book would be a good buy for you. You'll also learn how to design a Flash movie and have it ready to launch on the Web.I found the tutorials in the book a tad on the boring side, nothing really that looks nice or too complex. On the other hand, the book goes into some HTML and using AfterShock to configure and tweak up your projects.If your want to learn about Flash, or you just got interested in Flash, I recommend this book, whether you have Flash 4, this book will be fine (aside from Flash 4's new interface). If your looking for special effects how-tos and advanced Flash design, you won't find anything too advanced or complex out of this book."
2,Too expansive.,"I have the manual, and i find Plant's book is not a big help. But for guys who had a hacked version of Flash, without manual, it's the money worth. ;-)"
1,This book is identical to Macromedia Flash 3 User Manual.,"This book is identical to Macromedia Flash 3 User Manual; therefore, useless..."
2,"A good start, but could have more to it.","This book should be looked at as a manual replacement. It is confusing at the end and spends time on HTML and server issues, rather then advanced flash examples and tricks. The on-line discussion groups ,under macromedia, may be a better source for the advanced user."
3,Parts don't fit well,"I like the hybrid between the Chinese dragon and the eagle...the most zen looking dragon, but it is the most difficult dragon for me to assemble because of its wings.I own several McFarlane Dragons so I know that sometimes you gotta wiggle the parts until they're secured. However, the wings of this dragon don't fit well into their sockets, so they don't hold on to the dragon's body tight. So, now the figure stands fine (wobbling a little) but with the slightest touch on the wings, and they will fall off.The paint job is decent. Like all advertised things, the pictures always look better. So, I expect the dragon to have less contrast between colors."
2,Richard Todd rules !.,"There's really only one good reason to watch this movie: Richard Todd. -Well, there might be one more; if you think Joan Collins can act, this movie will prove you wrong. By the way, the film is about spies or something. And yes, the 2 stars are for Todd."
3,Shipping Vs. Product,"I love these cookies i feel that i cant live without them. At least i cant diet without them. However, the whole deal with the shipping was way too long. They take their sweet time to have this shipped and the travel time is just as slow. I need my cookies asap ppl. My delicious waffers deserve a 5 mins their slow shipping 2,"
4,My Review on this book,"since no one else in the world has read this book, and no one will ever see this page, I will tell you that this was a good book about life in a Roman army through the eyes of a soldier."
5,As Great as the Roman Empire,"An amazing book! My father gave it to me, since he had read it as a boy. Knowing Roman history makes it all the better, although I imagine it would still be good without. Definitely recommend!"
3,about up to the same standard as the other MK games,a solid entry into the MK series. It was great being able to play so many of the MK characters. That was the best part. I've yet to really have any great love for the whole konquest mode. but the gameplay is what we've come to expect-which is never a bad thing. Even the changes to the fatalities didn't bother me too much.
5,Dahhhhh,"A surge suppressor is not a battery backup, that is why it has no battery. What this does is it monitors the voltage coming in from the source and it regulates it so that momentary surges (spikes), or dips (brownouts), is kept at a constant. Either/or will do physical damage, to the hardware, that is plugged into the outlet, if it's severe enough. This unit is very good, so long as you stay within it's recommended guidelines. It is not meant for Air Conditioners, refrigerators, etc. Plugging one of them could start an electrical fire. This unit will handle a TV. It is meant for electronic equipment, including monitors, computers, TV and stereos, that are plugged into an outlet 24/7."
2,Keep your memories and don't revisit this movie,"I remember when this movie came out. All my friends, including me, thought it was great. We were 12. I took it out recently in the right frame of mind to relive my youth and great memories. To be straight to the point. The movie is awful. Terrible. Makes no sense at all. You would probably not find a 12 year old today who would like it. Maybe a 5 or 6 year old would like it. Everything about it is so over the top. The basketball game everyone raves about has one team of 7 foot guys against a team of 5 foot guys. When they get flubber put on their shoes they jump as high as the ceiling and everyone just basically thinks they got better at half time. Really? I can't believe that America was so naive in the 60""s to have actually found this funny. If you remember it fondly, keep your memories intact and don't watch this. I am warning you. You will be disappointed."
1,Sad day for DVD.,"Not only is this and many of the other live action DVDs released by Disney in January of 2003 being butchered to full frame instead of shown in their original widescreen ratio, but this movie is also being released in a colorized version.I thought we learned in the 80's just how evil colorization is, but I guess Disney hasn't learned. Avoid this horrible version at all costs and pray Disney learns how to properly release DVDs."
1,Disney should be embarrassed,"This movie is almost unwatchable because it is not in widescreen format. There are numerous scenes where two people are talking and you see less than half of each person's face. Every scene is arbitrarily cropped. It's not even pan and scan! The other issue is colorization. I would have much preferred black and white, but I can live with the artificial color. YMMV."
1,How To Ruin A Classic Movie--The Disney Method,"I was so excited to buy this DVD. I was expecting widescreen and original black and white. This would have preserved the presentation the film was meant to be seen in. I already own the video release from several years ago (pan and scan but thankfully black and white) and I never expected the new DVD to actually be WORSE than the video. I can only hope that Disney learns something from all of the unhappy customers out there and re-release this DVD in its proper form. Warner Brothers finally did the right thing with WILLIE WONKA, so I think that there is hope. Why own a DVD player or an HDTV if DVDs are released pan and scan?"
1,"DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE ""COLORIZED"" MOVIES","This is the ""COLORIZED"" version of this Disney film that they butchered by in the 1980's for the Disney TV channel. Disney must think that all their customers are adolescents and kids who don't know the difference, WRONG!I picked this up to buy in the store, saw that it was colorized, and immediately put it down. I will NOT support butchering of films. If Disney wants to release the COLORIZED version, fine, do it, but release the BLACK AND WHITE one as well for us purists who want them as originally intended.BAD, BAD, BAD, HOUSE OF MOUSE choice here. Hope they get rid of their head of DVD development. He/she must have been born in the 1980's!!!!"
1,1 Star for this version 5 Star for the memories,"Why do they still do it? Colourize movies that is. I remembered this movie from my childhood days and loved it ever since. Occasionally seeing it on TV still gives me pleasure. I bought the DVD and only after getting it home I found out it has been colourized. It went back to the store for a refund immediately mainly for that reason. Another minor reason, it is not widescreen. Poor judgement on Disney's part. I refuse to buy anything colourized. What would you do if they colourized ""It's a Wonderful Life or High Noon or Psycho"" Would you watch it? No one in their right mind would."
4,the Absent Minded Professor,A foolish comedy that likely would appeal to those of the older generation tho some younger ones may also find it funny if they are not too stimulated by todays sci-fi and hype. Fortunately it is a clean show.
4,The Absent Minded Professor,"It's so great to see a throughly entertaining movie that is free of sex, violence, drugs and politics. It has a good story, good characters, a plausible plot and a few surprises. What else could you want?"
2,What a SHAME!,"I hate colorization. This film is the poster child for not colorizing. Not only should it have been kept original, for all the reasons others have mentioned, but the person who did this should be let go. This has to be the worst colorization (destruction) of a wonderful classic film I have ever witnessed. Try Try again. Only this time dont mess with perfection. If it aint broke, PLEASE DONT FIX IT."
1,It could have been done so much better.......,"I agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers. This movie is a minor classic for the Disney Studios and they treat it like this? Why would you bother to colourize this movie...it is a B&W; movie...keep it is such. Please scrap this release and re-do it. A suggestion is a double DVD package with both this movie and its sequel, Son of Flubber. Each DVD should have some archive extras as well as a newly produced retrospective look back at these movies. How about including Donald Duck's ""Modern Inventions"" short? Disney did brilliant work with, Old Yeller, Pollyanna, The Parent Trap and Swiss Family Robinson DVD releases...but treats this movie in such a second rate manor?The live Disney pictures are adored by millions around the world. The DVD releases of these movies should be given the greatest respect when it comes to packaging...and pleeeeease...no more colourization."
3,"Great movie, lacks of information","It's great that Disney released this movie in its original aspect ratio and color, but, somebody knows if this release has Spanish subtitles? (or the Spanish audio track like the colorized version).I searched in a lot of pages, and i can't find a review of this release."
1,Walt would not be happy,"The screen makes me give it at least one star. This does not even deserve that.Waste of time and money. Why ? This film was shot in 1.75:1 (widescreen). Please show it in that. This film was an Academy Award Nominee (1962) -- Best Art Direction, Set Decoration, Black and White -- Carroll Clark, Hal Gausman, Emile Kuri. Why colorize an Oscar Nominee ?Try again Mike. Do it the way Walt would have wanted it."
1,"Colorized and ""Pan and Scan"" DVD - what was Disney thinking?","I was very excited about purchasing this DVD until I read that it was colorized and ""pan and scan"" (i.e., not the original theatrical aspect ratio). Disney must think its customers are eight year olds.Be forwarned: ""The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" which came out the same day as A-MP, is also ""pan and scan."" What a disappointment."
2,Why did they Colorize this movie ?,"When I started watching this movie I was struck by the number of people who had beautiful blue eyes and then I realized it wasn't real. There really aren't that many people with beautiful blue eyes without being colorized. This film won a academy award for black and white cinematography. Oh well, it's been colorized now. It's a shame."
3,Cute movie,"Great family viewing. Although dated, its still enjoyable even today although I suspect that young boys looking for action and high tech special effects may be disappointed."
4,A Great Family Film,"We watched this this weekend with our 9, 6 and 2 year olds, My son was howling laughing. Fun for the whole family!"
5,Fantastic Movie!,I loved this movie! It is an amazing comedy and VERY family friendly. We've watched it twice now and I'd strongly recommend it.
2,Not widescreen,"This DVD, along with the other Disney releases this month, (Moon Spinners, Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, etc.) is only being released in fullscreen, *not* anamorphic widescreen..."
5,Classical Disney,"I grew up with these classics from Disney. Great family entertainment at it's best! Disney reveals how the most amazing things can be discovered by ""The Absent-minded Professor"" in all of us. Fred MacMurray is the perfect choice for the character - his kind, gentle, simplistic genius and a little bit of vindictiveness really makes his character fly! Teenagers and young adults may find the special effects outdated, but if they can get beyond that, they will still find the story entertaining and fun to watch."
2,pointy edge,"I loved the feel of wood in my hand as i crochet. This hook is sweetly fragranced with a woody smell... energizing if sniffed between stitches! However the hooked edge is a little bit too sharp and pointy and gets stuck in the yarn at times.. was very hard to crochet with 3- and 4-ply yarn coz the pointy edge 'separated' the ply strands. Also, the entire hook is a bit too long. It's great as a collectible though.."
4,Worth a look,"This isn't a comprehensive manual of minimalism, so don't fall into that trap, as a coworker did. It does provide an overview of the principles of minimalism, but I didn't feel qualified as an expert (or even close) after studying it.That said, I appreciated it because it's a collection of papers rather than the thoughts of one expert, and allowed me to explore differing opinions on some of the points of minimalism. Rather than laying out a formula for writers to follow, I thought it encouraged writers to think about the principles of minimalism and why or why not to adopt certain tenets."
3,Average Atwood,"No one will mistake Margaret Atwood for Alice Munro when it comes to short stories. Most of these stories are trifles. Atwood's tendency to be elliptical really gets in the way of any development. Her narrators seem to just be skimming the surface of life with little or no consequence of that. Only the stories ""Bluebeard's Egg"" and ""Scarlet Ibis"" really rise above the level of craft, particularly the former. I love the preciseness with which Atwood details feminine rivalry over men! Overall, a hodge-podge of ""short fiction pieces,"" not short stories."
3,"Short stories, not novel","I was a little disappointed to discover that Bluebeard's Egg was a collection of stories, because I was hoping for another impossible-to-put-down novel by Margaret Atwood. Still, her writing style is fantastic no matter what medium she writes in."
1,Damn you MGM,Yeah the reviews below are right... poor keaton.. This was really really really sad to watch. If you are a fan of Buster you will know that this wasn't his doing and full responsibilty for this incredibly crappy movie is MGM. If you ever get your hands on it just burn it and run away.
1,Poor Buster is right!,"For any Buster Keaton fan, this is painful to watch. You feel sorry for him, and wonder how anyone connected with it thought it was funny at all. Keaton has little to do in this. Extremely unfunny attempt at farce. I'm glad I saw it on Turner Classic Movies, for free. They should burn it."
5,A wonderful book about disgusting behavior,"As a graduate of Harvard College, I can say I am more embarrassed than usual to admit it after reading Karabel's book. Karabel lays out in great detail the slimy admissions practices of the ""top"" Ivy colleges. Today's sub rosa selection process was born of anti-Semitism and carried on well into the middle of the 20th century. When I applied they required pictures, just to make sure the ""coons,"" as one Ivy official referred to Blacks, got special Jim Crow treatment. Now that era is passed, and the Asians wonder if there is a quota for them. The college officials cry, ""Goodness, No !"" Yet they continue to favor the children of the same alumni who were chosen as a result of the now decried previous discriminatory policies. (See George W. Bush). Then they call that ""fair."" After reading this book one will be convinced once again never to believe them. The irony is these colleges deliver only mediocre educations to underclass students."
3,Complete isn't exactly accurate,"This book is as good as but no better than the other 3 food count books I own by various authors. I bought this book because it said it was complete but obviously I do not understand what the author means by complete. I wanted to know potassium counts in various foods and while this book is adequate for calories, carbohydrates, protein, cholesterol, sodium, fat and fiber, there is absolutely no data for potassium. Back to the food labels..."
5,What I expected it to be!,"I recently joined Weight Watchers and I needed the nutritional values to determine points. It also included fast food that we have in my area. Unfortunately, most fast food has too many points, but I probably knew that. lol It also covered a lot of frozen entrees which was also helpful."
1,Kindle version practically useless,"The kindle version is useless because the data pages, 99% of the book, are graphic images and can not be searched. As well it does not include an index or table of contents. Avoid!"
5,A necessary tool for Insulin Pumpers,"If you are looking for a book that is going to tell you just a little bit about the food you put into your body... this isnt the book for you. If you are trying to eat better and learn about what you are putting into your body for the sake of counting carbohydrates or learning to change your behavior then you need this book. I was first introduced to Corrine's book when I started using an insulin pump about 11 years ago. The book is well researched, there is not much that it doesnt contain. What this book doesnt include can be easily extrapolated from other foods that are similar to what you are looking for.It also works well for the new Weight Watchers points plus calculations. Helpful if you are trying to do meal planning before you go to the grocery store."
1,Totally useless Kindle edition,"I bought this book in Kindle format because I thought it would be handy to have a reference available everywhere I take my Kindle -- which includes my office and restaurants on my lunch hour.My reaction to to this Kindle edition can be summed up in two words: totally useless.The reasons are:(1) No table of contents(20 It is NOT SEARCHABLE. All the pages are IMAGES.'Nuff said. The only way to find anything in this book is to laboriously page through it -- page by page by page.Every search turns up ZERO responses. Again, this is a totally useless book in the Kindle edition. If I could give it zero stars I would. DO NOT BUY IT FOR YOUR KINDLE.I am only hoping I can get my money back."
2,"Content is ok, too difficult to use on the Kindle.","Content seems to be good. Very detailed. However on the kindle the search feature is not great at locating what you are looking for; the font is super tiny and cannot be enlarged, I would return it if it were possible."
1,Not Searchable. Worst Kindle Conversion Ever.,"I wanted a portable and discreet calorie reference. I thought a Kindle edition that I could look up on my phone or ipad would be better than carrying a small book in my purse. In theory, that's true. However, the food count tables from this comprehensive reference (apparently 900 pages in paperback) are rendered in the Kindle edition as graphics. #Fail! Want to look up the data for turnips? Get ready to start flipping pages, because you cannot search for the term.Shame on you, Random House Digital! Next time, try using a markup language on your source content that allows for multi-channel publishing. Put the tables out as text, not graphics. For the love of god, at least create an alphabetic table of contents the reader can use to move quickly from the beginning to the middle or the end.I want my money back."
5,Food Counts,This provides very good info for ones who need to count there calories. I'm enjoying it.
2,Not satisfied here,What a letdown. Thought I had finally found a source of sugar content in foods. No such luck here- not any mention made in this book-how can it be called complete? Diabetice beware!
1,Kindle Version unsearchable,I downloaded the Kindle Edition and was surprised to find that the book is unsearchable. It seems that the book is nothing more than image copies of the original book which makes it unusable. I have bought the paperback version in the past and found it to be useful.
1,Unsearchable Kindle Version :-(,"The Kindle version appears to be a PDF; the font-size for the data can't be changed and the data is unsearchable. I probably would not have bought it had I known that.Also, when the screen is rotated, there's no option to zoom to page-width.In my opinion, this is not a very good fit for the Kindle and I would definitely return it if I could."
2,Disappointing,"Foods are conveniently organized alphabetically, but portions are not clear so it's difficult to use when trying to track calories. Example, grapefruit shown by size (diameter) - would be more accurate and convenient if all foods were shown in ounces and if the portion preceded nutritional content on every line."
3,Southern society,"The Unvanquished is an excellent book, which depicts life in the South during and after the Civil War. The title means ""the undefeated or the unconquered,"" and Faulkner expounds on this topic. One by one, the characters are defeated by either disillusionment, selfishness, or vainity ,and only one character withstands the terrible effects of the war: Bayard. Faulker does a remarkable job depicting the emotions of Southerners during this time and uses great imagery."
3,An odd little book,"An odd little book about a former ballet dancer dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The author describes herself as blonde and beautiful. She marries and divorces an Argentine man, but it's all in the background of her consuming tango obsession. With disjoint time and amost hallucinatory digressions into the emotions brought to the surface by tango, this reads a bit like ""Trout Fishing in America"" if it were tango instead of trout. There is a flip book built into the pages where a tango turns first into a violent attack and then into sheets of falling paper. This low-tech animation wordlessly caputures the themes in the text."
4,Great remix,"Most imports are definately overrated, but this deftones classic can't be ignored for one reason and one reason only, the ""Be Quiet and Drive"" remix. Its definately a a creative new version of it. The song is just an acoustic guitar, a drum machine/turntable and chino singing the classic deftones' song, and it is magical. the live version of birthmark was recorded pretty good. this cd is essential for the die-hard deftones fan."
5,good product,"Almost finished first bottle, beleive it is doing what I wanted.would you please re-order it for me.thankschas mincey"
2,No depth,"If you're looking for a book about how important good design is (no real suggestions on implementing a good design, just a long talk on how important it is), or a book that covers the basics of performance problem diagnosis, this is the book for you.If, however, you're actually looking for a book that delivers on what the title of this one promises, keep shopping."
1,Not Useful,"The author sums it up on page 58:""The books that fly off the shelfs in the technical bookstores are the ones that promise hidden tips on accelerating the performance of database systems""That's exactly what this book promises ""Tuning & Optimization secrets"" and exactly what it fails to provide!The first 100 pages are ""fluff"". I was looking for tuning and optimization information not a lecture on why physical design is important. If things like ""denormalization isn't always bad"" and ""indexes are often good"" are old news to you, skip this book.If you are looking for useful optimization and tuning information, look elsewhere."
2,At least get teh Book description correct!!,"If the book description is so wrong, how good could the book be? SQL Server versions are not 8i and 9i, maybe 8 & 9 depending how you reference, but 2000 and 2005 are more common version descriptions. 8i and 9i are Oracle versions, not SQL Server. The cover has SQL2005, that is how I could tell it was MS SQL Server. Combine the sloppy book description with other comments, I'll pass.Book Description""The most recent advances in SQL Server8i and 9i are covered to make a SQL Server database run as fast as possible."""
5,Who would have thunk it?,"Wow. What a wierd gem this is. The Scallions have a highly original sound made of very familiar ingrediants.Here's my description of what this sounds like: It sounds like what would happen were Donald Fagen and Walter Becker (from Steely Dan) to join ELO. I know that sounds like an absolutely hideous idea. I suspect this description might scare a few folks away but, like Dr. Seuss wrote about Green Eggs and Ham, try it - you'll like it."
2,"Chidrens Basic Long Sleeve Leotard (7-10, Brown)","This leotard is very thin and runs very small. My daughter is a petite size 7/8 and it was too tight on her. It got a hole the first day from trying it on, which required a little stretching."
3,"nice quality, poor sizing","We ordered the child's size 4-6, but it definitely does not fit my size 6 little girl. She is slim and still wears quite a few items that are size 5, so I thought 4-6 would work. Especially because the next size up is 7-10. I must return it now and try the 7-10 next, and just hope it isn't saggy since she's wearing this in a wedding as a flower girl with a little tutu."
4,leotard,"I ordered the long-sleeved leotard in two sizes. The sizing was odd, especially since I needed a 4T. I ordered both a 2-4T and a 4-6. The 2-4T was way too small for my normally 4T daughter. The 4-6 fit her. It was hard to decide, since both sizing had ""4"" in it. I had no idea if the 4-6 would swallow her, but it fits much more like a 4/5 than a 6. when ordering, I would go up a size. Hope they will return it with no problem...."
4,Great leotard!!!,"I needed a yellow leotard for a child's halloween costume and this delivered. My 4yr old is on the smaller side, but I still ordered the size up (4-6) based on the other reviews, and they were right. It runs a little small, so go up a size if you are unsure. Still a great buy!"
4,Good product for the money...great seller.,"This leotard is exactly what it says...a basic brown leotard. I don't have a lot to say about it, except that it is exactly what we ordered and exactly what we needed as part of a costume. The seller was great...the item arrived exactly when I expected it to arrive. Smooth transaction."
3,for softs fans only: single disk cd,"the cd i have and the one pictured is only a single disk and does not have the listing that is advertised above. this is music recorded in europe in 1970. the disk is about 47 minutes in length. recording quality is so-so. first 2 tracks, facelift and moon in june are excerpts under 6 minutes each. if you like the softs earlier material, get the cuneiform releases. i think they are hitting the bottom of the barrel of early live recordings. wouldn't mind seeing some live recordings of their later releases."
5,Collector's Item,"Really enjoyed the biography about an unforgettable icon. Learned so much about her life that I did not know. Photographs of Lena make this book a collector's item. Having grown up in New York, I saw her in the Broadway Musical, ""Jamaica""; and also in person on the street. She was such a lovely, talented person who has always been a role model for me."
3,A mistaken interpretation of Dzogchen and Tibetan Buddhism,"This text has now been published as ""Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness"" translated by John Myrdhin Reynolds and published by Snow Lion. This edition by Evans-Wentz is basically a misinterpretation of Tibetan Buddhism in general and of Dzogchen in particular. In the book ""Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness"" over forty pages are given to a detailed discussion of Evans-Wentz and Jung's basic misunderstandings. This alone is well worth reading so you can make up your own mind before (if) you decide to get the Evans-Wentz version. I have found the translation by John Myrdhin Reynolds to be far superior and truly inspirational."
2,Not a must read.,"I do not think that this was a very good book. All the jokes that Waugh tried to make were not funny, and the characters were dull. I would not recomend this book if you likes ones with a lot of action and suspense in them."
2,"Not good, but not all bad.","What I didn't like about this book is that it takes up too much time trying to describe every single thing. The author spent so much time trying to create an image in my head that I sometimes got lost and can't remember what the story is about anymore. I like things straight to the point with just a little description on the environment. That's how I like it. Secondly, I didn't like how the book made fun of the funeral industry. I was brought up to have great respect for the dead, so this book offended me very much. But I do have something good to say about it. Other than all of the bad things I have said about this book, I truly enjoyed the story. All of the surprise twists was the only thing that kept me from throwing the book away. Also, I loved the poetry in the book. So to be tuly honest, I guess it wasn't all bad."
1,Two Thumbs Down for Waugh,A poorly written book that revealed shallow characters that showed utter stupidity in their sick personalitys. The beginning of the story does not seem to have any connection to the end where some of the ideas begin to make sense. It takes place mostly at the Whispering Glades cemetery where employees are required to refer to the corpses as loved ones. A man who works there is in love with a cosmetican and shows how he thinks of the relationship by making the corpses smile and look sad before she works on them. And another man who is in love with her also lies about his identity and claims he is a poet by copying love poems and sending them to her. At the end she gets confused and the writer of a local column tells her to kill her self and she does which shows utter stupidity in her character. This book is merely lies and I give it two thumbs down.
1,The book was pretty boring,"Well the book was pretty boring to me. It was about two guys after a girl. Imight as well watch soap operas for that. And it is also about cemeteries. I don't find cemeteries interesting but rather creepy to me. And the title of the book was something I wasn't expecting. I thought it was a love story at first but as I read it, it wasn't. I just think she should have made a differnt tilte for the book. Now that's what I think of the book ""The Loved One""."
1,Infinite thumbs down.,"A poorly written book with characters too underdeveloped. The story starts in the middle. The first chapter is as though you have sat down with sombody in the middle of a conversation with themself. Evelyn Waugh's story is for the sick minded. She would have to be a sick person to think of these type of topics. Somewhat reminisent of Poe. i do not recommended to younger readers. A sick story about a sensetive topic, death."
5,"hmmmmmm, sweet sarcasm","I read this book about a year ago and it was only upon stumbling across it recently that I remembered how brilliant it was. Waugh's subtle sarcasm and sharp wit in this farce create an interesting and quirky plot. I absolutely adored how the story and its odd setting were simultaneously entertaining and intriguing, while criticizing the very foundations of American pop-culture. A definite must-read!"
4,A true love story and how people go through joy and pain,""" A tricky yet simple book, mixing irony, love, and death to make this a surprising book. One woman two men, what ending will come of this love triangle. One of Waugh's most prolific books yet."""
3,"An interesting novel, but slow and unwitty.","The Loved One was a very interesting book which had it's good and somewhat funny parts. It's questionable though, whether the good parts outnumber the bad. Some of the good parts are when Dennis first meets Aimee' and the times when the book would be describing the parts with Mr. Slump as the Guru Brahmin with his secretary and the other writer. The parts that made me either reread the part over again or just fall asleep were in the beginning when Dennis and Sir Francis were conversing or when Dennis first goes to Whispering Glades. Other parts pretty much just disturbed me. In the long run, the book was well written and it just depends what type of books you like to enjoy this. If your looking for a laugh out loud must read I'm not sure if I would recommend."
4,good value,Had a hard time finding this book to read for my bookclub. found it paid a penny(more for shipping than book) Well worth it as I didnt have to struggle to find and the book was in great shape. Once again amazon and its suppliers come through like champs.
2,THE MOST BORING BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!,"I've got to mention one fact, this book should be labeled ""Lullaby"" instead of ""Humorous"". The beginning of this book was so slow, I had to read it three times before I could make a connection to the second chapter. Also, what kind of guy puts smiles on other people's loved ones in order to express his feelings to the beautician. The plot of the book was extremely shallow because the meaning of the book was to poke fun at the burial industry. The book is a good tool to speed your reading because it is challenging to read, bu,t otherwise, the book is boring and it would be a good remedy for those suffering from insomnia."
3,Well worth reading!,"This book was worth reading because I found the satire amusing. The idea that the morticians would go through so much trouble just to make a corpse smile struck me funny. Even Mr. Joyboy's name was funny because he acted joyful, just like his name.Another thing I found interesting in the story was that there was not one character that I liked. I would recommend this book to someone who finds irony and satire amusing."
1,Difficult to read and not very interesting.,"The novel ""The Loved One"" by Evelyn Waugh had an unclear and confusing story line. The vocabulary was difficult to understand because they were mostly British terms. The author also wrote too much on feelings and thoughts rather then events and important conversations. The story was not easy to follow. The author seemed to jump around between people and conversations. Dispite all of this the end of the book came together. It finally became a little more iteresting to me. I thought the ending was twisted because both Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow said they cared about Mrs.Thanatogenos. In reality I think they cared more for themselves than for her. Over all though, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,i didn't find the book humourous or satirical.,"i didn't enjoy reading this book. i didn't find it to be a satire on either the burial industry or hollywood. i feel the book didn't live up to the reviews on the back of it. it was neither a laugh out loud satire or a vicious comedy. it was also somewhat confusing at times because of the over use of adjectives to describe settings. after reading this book i will probably never read one of his books again, unless required. though slim it read slowly and seemed longer than the hundred plus pages it was. overall i wouldn't recommend this book to any others than his fans."
1,This book was not interesting,"I thought this book was not very interesting. It did not keep my attention, and it was hard for me to follow a long. I beleive the author did not explain the book well enough and went into detail on how the characters felt. If I would have understood what happened in the begining I would have got the whole plot of it. Again I did not like the book and would not recommend it to any one."
5,A love line between three people two guys and a girl.,The Auther of the book puts alot of details in the book. This book was about JoyBoy and Barlow in love with the same girl. JoyBoy is an ultimate embalmer. He is also somewhat holy. Aimee Thanayogenos crematorium cosmetician knows that JoyBoy loves her. When their romance is complicatedby the apperance of a young English poet named Dennis Barlow. So when Barlow falls in love with Aimee she knows that both of the two guys like her. Finally she kills herself by a leathal injection and JoyBoy kills himself to.
3,Humerous and Ironic,"The ""Loved One"" written by Evelyn Waugh was very humerous and ironic They make death sound like a big joke. This novel ""The Loved One"" was easily read, but some parts were hard to understand. Especially the dialouge and the vocabulary. I would recommend a dictionary to clarify some of the vocabulary. The characters in this book were some what hard to understand. You have to concentrate really good to understand the story. I recommend this book to readers who like ironic endings. To me this book was a whole new experience because it had so much humor and irony. Overall this book was okay."
3,"it was very interesting,and very educational for us readers.","it is about two lovers that find it difficult to love one another with the appearance of a young english poet named denis barlow.this bizarre triangle is played out against an ironic and macabre backdrop:a full service funeral home for hollywood`s departed greats called whispering glades ,and a pet cemetery happier hunting gronds both final resting places for deceased loved ones."
2,A book that was hard to understand,"This book was confusing. It contained no action, suspense, nor thrill. What made me lose interest in this book was the fact that they talked about the deceased, how they died, and how their appearance were greatly transfigured. If I wanted to read about dead bodies I would have read a horror novel."
2,The book was neither interesting nor humorous,"The book, while amusing at times, could not keep my interest very long. The characters had no depth which kept me from getting to involved in the novel. To bring more definition to the characters the author should have developed more physical attributes to enhance their lifeness of their personalities. Another flaw in the novel was the lack of importance and care, for that matter, that I felt about the story line. I am not interested in the events that go on in a funeral home."
2,This book was an over all boring book.,"I thought that The Loved One was a fairly good book. Although, I felt the events in the book were very reaccuring. I also didn't fancy making fun of death and the people who have to deal with death. I do feel that some of the people in the burial industry are a little odd, and I got the impression that some of the characters the book, that worked in the burial industry, were also a little strange. I liked how the writer put bits and peices of poetry in the novel, but I didn't like how so many people committed suicide. The writer had good ideas, but the author could have used the ideas in a more presentable way. I thought the book needed to be more graphic. Evelyn Waugh must not have studied the burial industry before Waugh wrote about it, more occupational terms were needed. Evelyn Waugh needed to spend more time writing this novel before it was published."
2,Not on my top ten list,"I liked certain parts of the book and disliked certain parts. It was very hard to understand at times because of the British humor.I liked it when Mr. Barlow was asked to write about Sir Francis and the man didn't read it first and it was a joke instead of serious. Whispering Glades seemed like a very nice place. Otherwise, there was too much sadness. Like when Sir Francis hung himself, Mr. Joyboy being jealous that Miss Thanatogenos likes Mr. Barlow, and when Miss Thanatogenos kills herself. It is also weird that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Joyboy cremate her body and Mr. Barlow takes money from Mr. Joyboy and goes back to England."
3,A unique book filled with intertwined sarcasm and humor.,"The book was very well written and worthy of its high stature. The characters which he made up were filled with depth, almost as if they were real people. The situation he put the characters into was clever as well as humurous. His settings were beautifully crafted making the book realistic and thus creating a sense of reality within the book. All in all, I thought the book was one of the best I had ever read."
2,If you love Waugh,"...skip this one; or read it only because it takes 90 minutes and has two or three good laughs. Very slight. Not really in the same league as ""... Dust"" or ""Decline...""."
2,The book was very boring and slow reading.,This book was a boring novel for young people. It was hard to sit and read any large number of pages at a time. The humor was very subtle most of the time and the jokes usually flew right over my head. It was very descriptive about the time and place but very vague about most of the names and characters. Towards the end of the novel things started picking up and everything was clearer and made more sense. The plot of this book was very odd and peculiar.
3,Where is the video?,"This is, perhaps, one of the classic humor pieces of all time. J. Winters in a dual role (""We've got to get these STIFFS out of my cemetary"") and Rod Steiger as ""Mr. Joyboy.""If ANYONE has a source for a video of this, PLEASE let me know!"
4,A good criticism of America's Hollywood,"This book is not a monumental work, nor is it extremely profound, the main character however is a man that the reader cannot fully understand. Once I finished this book I was considerably more puzzled about Dennis' character than I was at the beginning. It is unpredictable from the start and a difficult book to put down. The ridiculous characters created by Waugh are what he might consider ""typical Americans"", unrefined, overly-dramatic, and confused. A note at the beginning of the book suggests that Waugh wrote the book after a visit to Hollywood in the middle of the 20th century and it is somewhat apparent as you read ""The Loved One"" that he has a disregard for American ""values"" or ""character"" and as an American reader you can see for yourself what absurdities reside in our way of life, both then and now. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in good, humorous literature, maybe not to a casual reader, however."
3,I thought the book had some okay parts but a little dull.,"I thought that the book had a few funny parts but the rest of it was pretty dull. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I did not find all that much of it funny at all. I thought that the book had alot of emotion, which is good, such as the parts when Sir Francis and Miss Thanatogenos commit suicide. The one part that I found funny was when Mr. Slump got tired and annoyed by Miss Thanatogenos's letters and phone call and says,"" Maybe she should find a high window and jump. Especially with a name like that."" Over all though I liked the book more that I disliked it so I found it easier to read."
4,The Loved One is a story about love and loss.,"I feel the story The Loved One was a mind catching novel about loved ones. It keeps you wanting to read more but at the same time wondering why. The story is very morbid and could be disturbing to sensitive people or even people who have lost a loved one lately. The Loved One is brilliantly written and very enjoyable. I found the first chapter to be very confusing and the fifth chapter to be a little slow moving, but other then that I enjoyed reading it."
3,It was boring at first but picked up later.,"The Loved One was a pretty interesting book, and i can't say i have ever (or will ever)read a book like this. It was extremely original and some parts were funny. I must say though that i was expecting more. When I read the back cover it said that The Loved One was a comedy about the commercialization of death. I did not think it was that funny. Also the first three or four chapters bored me, and I had to read them 2 times because I was not paying attention. The end is pretty smart though. Overall I found the book to be average. I liked the end but not the beginning. I would not recommend this book unless you like books with ironic endings or you really like English Literature."
2,THIS IS NOT AN OUTRAGEOUSLY COMIC NOVEL,"BEFORE I READ THE LOVED ONE I TOOK TIME TO READ THE REVIEW ON THE BACK OF THE BOOK AND IT SEEMED INTERESTING, BUT LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT THE STORY INSIDE WAS FAR FROM THAT. THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK WERE BORING BUT THE REST OF THE CHAPTERS WERE NOT AS BAD.I DO NOT THINK I WILL WANT TO READ ANOTHER BOOK WRITTEN BY EVELYN WAUGH.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO READ IT."
2,The book I had to read 2 times to understand it.,It is very hard for me to write a review of this book because it made little sense to me at times. I was expecting much more from this book and from the author. I did enjoy the way he created a very uniqe plot which made the story seem realistic and portray Hollywood as it really is. I think the characters in the story should of been developed with more thought.The only part I really understood was the end because it seemed to come together with the rest of the book.
2,PET CEMETARY,"This book ""The Loved One"" starts off as a boring book but by the end of the novel the books starts to get a little more enteresting. The novel ends up as a funny and emmotional novel."
2,I thought this book was very boring.,"Evelyn Waugh's The Loved one was a very boring book. I did not enjoy reading it. This is the most boring book I've ever read. i think there should've been a stronger conflict between Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow. If Evelyn Waugh would've changed some parts it would've been better. For example, Ms. Thanatogenos shouldn't have killed herself. Instead, she should've ditched the Joyboy and left to Europe with Mr. Barlow. Mr. joyboy should've been the one to commit suicide. I seriously do not recommend this novel!"
2,It was OK.,I never really read a book by Evelyn Waugh. To me I gave this book two stars because at the beggining it took a while for the book to start. This story was O.K. cause some people died in it. It's also tragic because it's about relationships.
2,Two Thumbs down for Evelyn Waugh.,The book was extremely dull to my point of view. The characters seem very dull and foolish. Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Slump Prove my point. The book was said to be a comic novel of the commercialization of death itself. I do not believe of that fact. This book was very boring and i do not recommend it to the any readers of any age. As i said this book recieves two thumbs down.4
2,A hard book to understand,This book did not interest me. I found this book somewhat difficult to understand. When Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow ask Miss Thanatogenos to marry her you would expect them to clash against each other. Since there was no hostility between the two gentlemen there was a lack of action in the book which made the novel very dull. What I found very unappealing in this book was the gruesome parts such as the dead bodies which were disfigured. This is what I would look for in a horror novel.
3,Funny and Good Read,"A good, not great novella by Evelyn Waugh that is hilarious as it is timely. Though written in the 1940s this book still has a lot to say about our culture vis-a-vis death today. A quick and enjoyable read."
4,For fans of the old Alfred Hitchcock Hour who like a laugh and a scream.,"There is something to be said about the humorous dance macabre and Mr. Waugh, in this brief book weaves an interesting tale of a love triangle farce punctuated by death and cynical humor. Not for the happily-ever-after crowd, but well worth a weekend read, if only for the punchline ending."
3,Each person in this book had his or her own little world,"I thought that this story was very bland and at times a bit indescribable. It showed that every person had their own little world in which they meditated and thought that the world revolves around them, dealing with their own, and only their own problems. In the end practically all three of the people were at a loss. The english-man had lost a fiance and a career in america. Mr. Joyboy had also lost his fiance, as well as a life for having the thought that people would accuse him of murder. Both having Ms. Thanatogenos as their fiance. And Ms. Thanatogenos losing her life and both men that she loved."
3,This novel is full of dry humor,I thought that The Loved One was not a novel of humorous display but of dry humor. It was a grim love story between a Britsh poet and an American crematorium cosmetician. Throughout the novel there were horrible acts of violence which made the plot of a love story more interesting. In my point of view the book could have had more humorous displays. The reason I gave it three stars was because there were many boring parts throughout the book. Due to these boring parts it loses your interest in the book. But all in all it was somewhat of an appealing book.
1,Interesting concept but not well executed.,"""Fragments"" offers an interesting concept, the fusing of the minds of several savants in a collective intelligence. However, a concept is not enough to sustain a book.In my opinion, the problem with ""Fragments"" is a basic one. The reader never really gets to know, or care about, the characters in the story. Part of the problem may be that there are too many characters to keep track of. In any case, the people we meet in this book are never really fleshed out.I think James David has some potential as a horror/thriller author. I think he just needs to refine his writing a bit first."
4,"pretty good, original book","has one of the most chilling, creepy beginnings of a book I'ver ever read. Howerever gets a little predictable in some ways, but nice mix of horror, mystery and sci fi. I'd recommend it, and I hope James David keeps writing.. characterizations quirky and believable..read this one!!"
4,Better than you might think,"I bought this CD to give to a colleague who wanted the Kuhlau concerto. I had never heard it before and had no frame of reference for performance, but Felicja Blumental's playing seemed never less than quite satisfactory. I knew that Blumental had recorded all sorts of piano and orchestra oddities during the LP era for marginal labels, but was not prepared for such a pleasant listening experience. I turned to her Schumann concerto -- something quite well known--and again her pianism seemed warm, incisive, and often poetic.The orchestral accompaniment varies in quality, and the provincial orchestras used are occasionally not up to the task. The Schumann and Kuhlau appear to be in stereo; the small filler (Saint-Sans' Wedding Cake) seem in mono.Recommended."
1,What happened to tracks 11 & 12????,Buyer beware--the track listing shows that this CD has two extra songs on it that it most definitely DOES NOT! Only tracks 1-10 are included on the CD!
5,Christmas Sing With Frank and Bing - can't beat it for the holidays!,Love this CD - highly recommended! Who can't get on board with listening to Frank and Bing crooning out the classics for Christmas?!?
3,Evriholder Turtle Top Bottle Opener,I found the pop-top can opener did not work all that well. The rest of the opener was all okay.
4,Handy little opener,This is a handy little opener. Keep in it handy in a drawer. It works good opening liter bottle tops.
2,Unexpectedly High,"I had to return these sandals. They were so high. I do wear high heels all the time but not as high. I couldn't stand on them. Walking was out of the question. The make was impeccable, though."
3,Confession,Not knowing about this artist I came away with respect for his craft. Indeed he has talent and looking forward to listening to more of his work.
3,P.E. has good grooves,"The sound is definiately Peven...His ""Studio Confessions"" release should have included his underground hit with Roy Davis' ""Gabrielle"""
5,Worked for Polk 6501 6.5 component speakers,Worked for Polk 6501 component 6.5 speakers in doors of 2006 Toyota 4Runner.I got 2 pair because it doesnt state adaptors it says adapter So you only have to order one and you get a pair.
4,Worked Well,"This product worked well. I took a chance on this after doing a little research. Installed into 2007 FJ Cruiser. Be careful when installing, the Toyota factory nuts are plastic and can strip easily."
3,Schoshe speaker adaptors,"This product would work well if you are getting component or coaxial speakers, keep in mind that it is for only 6.5"" speakers, not for factory replacement 6x9. Would work well if it had the ability to add 6x9's, but it was of no use for me since I had to make my own adaptor plate."
5,Nostalgic,"I was surprised and delighted to find this bit of nostaglia from years passed by; In the 70's I often listened to Richard Layos a DJ on a Los Angeles Jazz station, I think on Sunday evenings they would always play Latin Jazz which included many of Ralfi Pagan's hits. I ordered 2 CD's one for myself and sent one to my brother who also loved his music. His tender love songs are timeless. Even if your not familiar with his music, if you're looking for something romantic and intimate with a latin flare, this is IT!"
5,An Unknown Classic,"Pagan's The Legend is just that: a legend. The tantalizing rhythms and soothing melodies make this one of Pagan's best -- if not the best. ""No Soy De Ti"" is a favorite as is ""Make It With You"" (lyrics in English and some Spanish). An exceptional buy that is worth having in one's collection, the time to do so is now. You'll not be sorry."
1,fidn't dit,"Physically it bolted on, but the electrical connector was totally different so made jumper wires which I connected to the same positions, but that did not work either. It only cost $20 and is hardly worth my time to send back. I may have and alternator shop check it out to see if it can be made to work with an adapter plug for less than a new one."
1,replacement battery,"I bought the Plantronics 590A with dongle, worked great for just over a year. Paid $108, then the battery quit accepting a charge. Called Plantronics for replacement, they wanted more than I paid for the unit to replace the battery. I'll never buy another Plantronics anything again. Now I see they've almost doubled the price. Unbelievable!"
3,Worked Half Good,"I like the style and comfort of the headset, and the sound quality was very good. The multipoint function did not work. It was easily paired with multiple devices, but would only connect and respond to one at a time. It was suppose monitor and to respond to incoming calls on either paired device(I was using a it with a laptop and a bluetooth telephone (wired bluetooth desk phone in the office and a cell phone in the field), and be able to answer calls from either device. The one I received would only respond to calls on the last device it had been paired with. I have returned it, and looking forward to receiving it's replacement (same model), It was a no questions asked return for either an exchange or refund."
2,Mono-audio and mic quality so so,"I realized this was an older unit, but liked the format of how the headset looked and functioned. A co-worker of mine owned one of these units. The stereo quality of the unit works great, but when switching into voice mode, audio changes to mono-mode (even when connecting with a MacBook Air) and the mic quality is so so and cuts out for periods of time. I'm on Skype a large portion of the day and had to revert back to my old headset after just 1 call. I love the wireless nature of this headset, but with poor voice quality that's a deal breaker for me. Additionally I have some hearing loss so that makes it a bit harder for me with lower quality audio."
3,The Riddles Of Classic Fairy Tales,"I have read several of Maria Tatar's books for critical fairy tales analysis.The book is lush with beautiful drawings and the writing style is acutely very good, and very easy to read, and understand.However, I just really wasn't impressed because I had known most of the information that was presented in thisvolume.I acutely would recommend her novel The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales and her up coming book The Annotated Brothers Grimm ( this also looks very interesting. )The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales ( to me at least. ) Would be a good starter point for someone who really wants to know the truth about fairy tales.More recommend for new comers who want's great art work and something easy to read."
3,Interesting,"The book is quite interesting but rather academic. I had the feeling I was reading someone's PhD thesis, albeit an interesting one."
4,4 stars,"Some of the analysis is forced and superficial, but overall this is an excellent analysis of fairy tales and their significance. Includes some genuinely profound insights on the topic. Overall worthwhile."
2,Cheap...and that's about it.,"The ink is noticeably watered down compared to OEM and does not last nearly as long.However, for the price, you can't really complain..."
1,Misleading product,"I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal. Not so. The stone is clearly costume jewelry. It is an ugly white translucent stone with barely a hint of color. Also, the stones are on hooks, NOT attached solidly with a full loop so the 'gems' keep falling off the base with any movement. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
3,Boring,I just don't have the heart to rate this book any lower. But it was really boring. I'm glad I bought it used and not new...
3,Poor Print Quality,"The pressman let us down... Half of the photos in the book are too blue. I would expect a color history to have GOOD color. The other half of the pages are the over-saturated lack of contrast that comes from economy printing processes but at least the color balance on them is good. The history part of the book is good. As an owner of a 280SL, I was disappointed in the quality of the printing, but not the content..."
4,Updated version coming April 2009,"I didn't really know what chine colle was until I bought this book, and was a bit disappointed about how much emphasis was placed on making the glue. But now that I've done a bit of printmaking, I can understand why the whole process can be a bit tricky and this kind of thoughtful research is needed.By the way, Crown Press has announced a second revised edition due end of April 2009. (That's sure going to put an end to the gouging that's going on the used book market...)"
2,Series 4 Big Let Down,"Unfortunately, it only took two episodes of Danny Blue in charge for me to stop watching the entire 4th season. Every show needs a baffoon, but you don't put the baffoon in charge, it's not even logical to think they would do that, and it's very hard to watch.I hear Adrian Lester will be back for season 5. I may pick the series up again then. Excellent Series until this point, though. 1, 2 and 3 are well worth it."
5,The Brits know how to do this stuff,"We love Hustle, though, this version (without Adrian Lester) isn't quite as good as the earlier seasons. Can't wait for the newest season (where Adrian is back) to become available."
1,Beyond disappointing!,"Hustle had such promise at the end of its third season. Then Adrian Lester left for other projects. Those who remained soldiered on in his absence and produced a fourth season. Having watched it, though, perhaps they should have known when to walk away. The characters foundered without a leader. The series itself was left without even adequate plots. An episode about horse racing--wait, wasn't that done in the first season? Two episodes filmed in the U.S. in the same season? Isn't this a British series? The only con that occurred in season four was the one perpetrated on the viewers, who were fooled into watching this utter disappointment.The fourth season undoubtedly put an end to what was a great series. As far as this fan is concerned, though, Hustle ended after three terrific seasons."
2,Slow-pitch softball for the Arkestra,"From the same sessions as _Hours After_. As every other title in the discography will attest, the man is capable of much more than this. Mr Ra takes a straight-ahead shot at mainstream material. Quite poor."
5,Relaxing,Love the relaxing music :) reminds me of beautiful Germany in the snow :) A must for country loving Christmas
1,WHY??? DEAR GOD WHY?!?!?!?!,I remember when doing a Bond theme used to mean something. It used to set you apart from other musicians. But it seems now it's been reduced to nothing more than a mere soundtrack. And Madonna just dumped a steaming pile on to the 007 franchise.Actually she will go down in history for the WORST BOND THEME EVER!!!
1,...'muzak' that totally ruined the beginning of the movie,"I can't believe that the producers selected this drivel for the beginning of the latest Bond movie. I listen to techno regularly, but this is a total waste! Save your money."
1,"Tasteless, Noisy ...","Remember when Bond music was classy and featured talented singers? For example: ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""You Only Live Twice"" and even ""Moonraker"" come to mind. Now THAT is Bond music.Well, this garbage song is as bad as Madonna's acting. Kick a bucket down a flight of metal stairs while playing a tune by Dirty Vegas and it will sound exactly like this monstrosity.I can't believe that people would even think about buying Madonna's new mess; probably the same people who think that she is a great actress.."
4,Break The Cycle,"Madonna returned in late 2002 with a new single from the James Bond movie DIE ANOTHER DAY. The title track is a nice mix of electronica, accompanied by a nice string arrangement reminscent of her 1986 hit Papa Don't Preach. It's an infectuous song that will make you sing along and want to dance. The remixes are pretty good, among the highlights are the Deepsky remix, the Retrolectro remix, and the Dirty Vegas Mix. Overall a must for Madonna fans, once again giving a maxi single worthy of her name on it."
5,Die Another Day remixes are amazing!,"Madonna once again proves she is still the Queen of Pop with this new single. The remixes are awesome and take you on a ride. I would highly recommend this maxi-single. I am a local DJ in my area, and I must say, I am playing this CD so much I'm certain it will be worn out by Thanksgiving."
1,Where's The Video???,"Okay, so I go to the store today to buy the single...... I get there and there's a big sticker on the front of the disc saying Die Another Day Video included on this CD....I get home.... NO VIDEO!!!What's up with that.... And the remixes leave a lot to be desired..... Not the best remixes she's had.... nothing really danceable or anthemic which people like to dance to....I prefer the original version much better....The single get's only one star because of the false advertising...Bad Warner Brothers... Bad Bad Warner Brothers...."
1,Say it ain't so!!,"What pimply-faced kid made the decision to use this as THE Bond theme? There are four critical elements to a James Bond epic. 1) A dynamite opening sequence, 2) a seductive Bond-girl, 3) gadgets, and 4) a memorable, sexy, theme song. If it's possible for a song to be mis-cast, this is it. I've listened to it about a dozen times and it doesn't fit into the Bond mold at all. I only hope the rest of the soundtrack covers for it. If it's half as good as the soundtrack to ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" or ""The World is Not Enough"" I'll be thrilled. This song, while a decent dance tune, is a dreadful choice for the Bond theme."
1,Make it stop!!!,"This ""song"" is awful. Is is just more of the same junk that began a few years back with ""ray of light."" Enough already with digital encoding and vocal trickery. You have tons of money -- learn how to sing -- take acting lessons -- but do something that requires real effort."
4,"Wonderful remixes, but no album version??","All the remixes are good, all the vocals are awesome, but I don't understand why we only get a short radio version on track 1 instead of the full original version. Maybe to sell more DAD soundtracks?However...this is a must have. The lyrics are funny, the remixes a delight, especially the Dirty Vegas one.Don't die Madonna!"
5,Breaking bounderies,"Die Another Day yet proves Madonna has the power to break bounderies. This is one of the only songs on the raido with its own sound and unique blend of strings and electronca. It breaks the bounds of Bond. Tired and OLD are those slow wimpy songs that are easily forgetful. Die Another Day breathes new life into Bond, and will be a song people will still know in the distant future. Madonna breaks the mold and does it well. The remixes are yet again groundbreaking, and they make work outs (if you listen to CDs in the gym) adrenalyn rushed. Also, this song MAKES me want to see the movie, instead of it just being a cool song, it also gets me to the movies. I highly recommend Die Another Day."
5,Killer Bond Theme... The Best Of Them All!,The CD Single is totally all that! The remixes are fierce and the album cut is just all that! Here's to Madonna's next # 1 hit! Can't wait for the next album! Hit us hard M!
4,Madonna is back!,"What did you expect from the queen of pop music? Her latest single, ""Die Another Day"" (from the upcoming James Bond movie), has already made it to #28 on the charts as of Oct. 26, 2002. I rushed to my CD store the day it was released. The song is absolutely techno-dazzling! That's the only way to describe it. The best track is the third (Thee RetroLectro Mix), but the original version (radio edit) is a Madonna classic. Be ready to hear Cher-like voice effects. I'm sure this single will get to #1 as it is Madonna's first release in a long time. The video is equally stunning.. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a big surprise!"
3,Cool song,"This song is cool..not spectacular, but enough to hold us over until Madonna's new album is released early next year. This is the UK part 2 of Die Another Day. It includes the Deepsky Mix Edit not available on the U.S. release."
4,MADONNA AIN'T DYING ANYTIME SOON.,"Madonna is back with the new bond single ""Die Another Day"" the first Bond single to hit Top 10 since Duran Durans ""A View To A Kill"".This is a good song, but doesn't have the 5 star worthiness of Bond like ""A View To A Kill"" or ""For Your Eyes Only"" by Sheena Easton.This is a great dance song, has that ""Papa Don't Preach"" violin break in the song, and is fun to listen to, and will definitely keep Madonna on top.Just doesn't have the Bond sound. Madonna as always is in fine form at 44 years of age she is still spitting out Top 10 singles 20 years later. You Go Girl!A great song, highly recommended for the dance enthusiast, just not strong Bond material."
2,Only for Madonna fanatics,"While it's not hideous, it's below average for Madonna and a below average Bond song. The mixes don't have much to work with. You won't run screaming from the room once the CD begins playing, but it's unlikely you'll choose to listen to it repeatedly.A much better Madonna/movie song is ""Beautiful Stranger"" from the Austin Powers movie ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" There is a singles CD of that song that I recommend.As far as ""Die Another Day,"" I think it's headed for my CD morgue. I would only recommend it to Madonna fanatics."
2,Analyze what?,"Madonna ponders whether to switch hair color today or tomorrow and name checks the wrong movie in the process. She must've thrown this together between takes on ""Swept Away."""
2,Failed atempt at new Bond Song,"I love Madonna and I love Bond so what better could you ask for?First of all, How about a song that sounds like a Bond theme. Secondly, how about a song that is interesting to listen too?Madonna is slumming it on this one. Her voice sounds terrible and the song has none of the Bond-ish flavor of past 007 pop songs.The remixes are a bit better but not worth your money."
3,Average,"""Die Another Day"" is not Madonna's best, nor her worst. The song itself features some wonderful strings from Michel Colombier, which are the only thing that makes this song sound anything like a bond theme. This track also features Madonna's voice heavily vodocored, which I think she has been over using lately, and standard Mirwais like on the Music album.The single starts out with the radio edit of the song, which like I said is pretty average. This stays true with the remixes too. None of them are spectactular, but the Deepsky Mix is the best of the bunch. This really isn't for non-fans."
5,love it,What can I say it's a great song to dance to. I love it and think it's the best dance song yet. Hey I'm a Madonna fan so sue me.
3,middle of the road record,"so madonna meets bond and this is the result. i have searched and scanned through 120 reviews. it would seem there are 3 factions. the first is ""hated it"" the second is ""loved it"" and the last, which i am a part of is ""not bad, not good""i found some of the material innovative and interesting while other stuff is kind of boring. the song itself is NOT the one from the original soundtrack. they make you buy the album if you want THAT one. we get the radio edit and a bunch of remixes. some of the remixes are amazing while others put me to sleep.the music is in the vein of techno but with a added touch of ambience. i think it updates bond for the new era but also understand why some bond fans will dismiss it. it is differet from what your used to but i think, if you give it a chance. you will see this is good music. not great but not bad. like i said....good music. be wellmilkboydanny@hotmail.comm"
3,Madonna? Yes. Bond? No!,"Another catchy little ditty from Madonna, who has effectively destroyed the ""aura"" of Bond-themes with this little number.Gone are the lush, ominous string sections and the brassy stabs that have marked almost every Bond theme ever written. Instead we have a pop-tune that may be quite well-suited for the dance floor, but did little to build the excitement for the adventure about to begin onscreen.Her vocoded voice sits over a staccato-like riff, and we just kept expecting the real theme to come in... but it never did.This disc is only saved by the very cool remixes!"
1,Worst Bond Song Ever,"A poorly done song, totally out of sync with the Bond mythos. When I saw the movie in the theater the audience was grumbling and muttering all through the song. The song was forced on the movie by producers, who hoped to bring in the youth market with a Madonna song and a cameo by her. Composer David Arnold has been very public about how much he hated the song and refused to use any riffs or themes from it in his soundtrack. The song is just not right for a Bond movie.This song is widely regarded as the worst James Bond theme since ""The Man with the Golden Gun."" Of appeal solely to Madonna fans and fans of electronica. Those looking for a vintage-style Bond song should stay away.And congratulations to ""Die Another Day"" and Madonna for their Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song!"
2,STOP!!!,"If you've heard ""Die Another Day"" from the music video, then you'll be disappointed not to find it here on this cd single. Instead you get the shortened ""radio edit"" which sounds like it ends prematurely, especially after hearing the longer version. In addition there are a series of really monotonous dance versions which aren't in the spirit of the original; they're certainly not as good.The one aspect I've learned about Madonna's music is you can't improve upon perfection. Perhaps the original extended version is on the soundtrack?"
1,What in the world,"I wish that she had done better but no. This is a disaster. Hopes for the movie go done abit hearing this joke of a bond song. Dance music of this age does not mix with Bond. this rating system did not go lower than 1 star, i would have voted 0."
2,"If this is it, she might as well die today","This song does not totally [bad]. The lyrics are catchy and it's fun to dance to at a club. But it's the kind of song that I would expect from Britney Spears or some other disposable music- in-a-box type of act. Not from Madonna who has written some pretty good songs(lyrics and music).Another thing, Madonna does not have a multi-octave voice like Cyndi Lauper's or other pop icons but her voice is very nice and sexy. In this track what you'll hear could have been song by anybody. It's just an overprocessed computer voice. You would never know it's her. Much worse than what they did with ""Music"". Very dissapointed."
1,God Awful!,"I just listened to this track, and considering the past pedigree of Bond title songs I can't believe this awful synth pop rubbish will now be placed alongside such classics as ""Goldfinger"" or ""The man with the golden Gun, Live and let die or View to a Kill to name but a few!!I for one will not be buying this tripe! Madonna should be ashamed of herself!!"
2,Hum Hum,"Sure there are some nice remixed but hey isn't this a James Bond track. I'm sorry but Madonna has probably gone one step to far. Forget about the sex book, forget about Justify my love, all her trashy outfits in the 80's all the lovelives and scandals. nothing can beat this one. The worst bond theme song in history and one of the worst movie songs of all time. She doesn't even sing. A Computer sings for her. The video is boring and not original and this song sounds like a song that is used in a cocoa cola commercial. This is not a bond track and I am no fan of James Bond but I Know great songs when I hear one and this is not it. [...] I used to like her but she is now very overrated and overhyped and exposed [...]."
4,Skull yourself,"Perfect little air valve caps to make your car, or motorcycle look cool. Great price, quick delivery.My Harley has a skull theme, and these little skully's capped of the customization of my scoot.Very cool ;)"
2,"Neat Idea, Poor Quality","When I found this clock on Amazon I loved the idea - kind of funky and fun. I thought it would be an interesting touch for my dorm room. However, I was really disappointed when it arrived this week. The entire product is poorly made. I thought it would be a solid piece, but instead it is a piece of metal in the shape of half a box (missing the back and ends). The design is put on like a sticker, which caused a problem particularly with the hand that is a cut out from the picture because part of the sticky side is exposed. It is extremely sticky and catches easily on things. Also, the hands just felt cheap and didn't even line up that nicely. Perhaps with better construction this clock would be a nice item, but it was definitely not worth the $40 I paid for it (shipping is quite pricy seeing as it only cost me about $5 to send it back). If you like interesting clocks, I'd suggest Target; they currently have some really neat ones out for the college rush."
4,Excellent series continues,"Dan Harrington, Harrington on Hold'em: Expert Play for No-Limit Tournaments, vol II: Endgame (Two Plus Two, 2005)Well, Harrington on Hold'em vol. I was fantastic; why should we expect anything less from volume II? And it should be no surprise when Harrington delivers.In Volume I, we learned about early- and middle-stage play. Volume II covers the endgame-- short tables, short stacks, getting blinded out, that sort of thing. If the book does have a weakness, it's that most of Harrington's scads of examples put the player on a medium or high stack; one would expect a book aimed at teaching players to reflect more of where they're likely to be, which is at the bottom of the barrel. While Harrington does address this situation on occasion, it's not terribly often.Volume III, a workbook, is poised and ready to drop as I write this. Can't wait. ****"
3,"book is good, kindle's app needs improve","The book is good, but to me and to millions like me, no native english speaker and user from android app, it is hard when a unknow word cames, you need stop read, select search in internet and then change the google to google trsnlate. It would be a lot easier if there was a translate dictionary inside the app, like there is in the kindles real devices. But it's worse to my opponents because my english is good enough, huge better than the average in brazil. in fact almost no player speak english."
5,Best of the best!!!,The first volume is very good. But this one is the best. Harrington makes you to win. It shows you to play in the later phases of a tournament. Read that stuff.
4,Good book,"Good, solid fundamentals. I am a conservative player and I found this (and his first book) very helpful. I am playing better and better."
4,Harrington on Hold'em 2,"Excellent strategy and unselfish with the pro insight into the game. However, if you read Volume I, you must read Volume II in order to get the full benefit; Volume II certainly completes some ideas in Volume I. The advice from both books is all solid but because it is written around Harrington's general play, expect to undergo an adjustment period until you can successfully apply his investment tactics to your style."
5,great book.. lots of examples and info,i had bought the first book in a bookstore and while i was reading it it was so simple and informative i knew i had to order the second one... it arrived the day before i finished the first book and i read it right after.. great read... i was already pretty decent before. but reading these books has helped me get to second place in my league of 40!!! there are still 5 out of eleven tourneys left but I'm in great position to get a nice WPT entry... Get the book! or don't and stay a donk
5,Great Addition to Volume 1,"There have been many in-depth reviews of this book so I will make this short. This book builds on the concepts in Volume 1 to further improve your playing. Some of the concepts and strategies are not as intuitive but make perfect sense and are statistically sound (e.g., As your M and the M of your opponents decrease - avoid playing small pairs and mid to low suited connectors since the implied pot odds can not reach a level to make these hand profitable late in a tournament). Many, many, many advanced topics covered to improve your game late in No Limit tournaments. Mor great insight from a top poker pro."
5,Excellent,"If you understood and enjoyed v1, then this is a must. It certainly goes deeper into the topic, but gives some great advice for those looking to hone their strategies for late play. Strongly recommend v3 workbook."
3,Intriguing,"Good graphic novel. For some reason when I bought it I thought it was going to be scary. The story is kinda intresting, it is told from a childs perspective. The boy speaks about the differences of adults and children. This reminded me of when I was a kid. And it made me aware of how ""dumb"" us adults are too think we are ""all mature"".It was a good read. I have nothing bad to say about it. I think 3 stars does it justice though."
5,Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean are GODS!,"I am 18 years old and I don't read alot of books. But occasionally I buy books just for the pure joy of owning a piece of art. I found Mr Punch in a bookstore and it's unique artwork immediately hinted me to buy it. I've heard Gaiman from DC Vertigo's Sandman and Death series but now i'm motivated to get the entire collection of Gaiman/McKean novels. There's no way to discribe the imagery and moody metaphors of the memories of life and death. If and when I would own my own little bookstore by the sea side, I would fill it all with books of such influence."
4,Wonderfully moody and oh so atmospheric,"Neil Gaiman delivers yet another knockout in the realm of the graphic novel with his wonderfully dark and hallucinatory 'Mr. Punch.' A tale of dark and gloomy childhood flashbacks, 'Mr. Punch,' is a great read for those looking for something oozing with chilly atmosphere. The mixed-media (enhanced photos and pencils) artwork by Dave McKean is astounding as well and visually evokes a feeling of helplessness confronting a child when stuck in a grim and depressing environment that amplifies all of his little fears. While this book is nowhere near the epic grandeur of Gaiman's, 'Sandman,' series - as a standalone, 'Mr. Punch,' is a visual and narrative treat not to be missed."
5,A+++++ and then some,"Installed on my 07 ranger today, bolted right on. Had to take the spare off to give me some work room. To install , remove spare, loosen front step bumper bolts,remove back step bumper bolts and clips in the frame. use supplied washers nuts and bolts to finger tighten the hitch to the bottom of the frame. Tighten and put the spare back. some frames need to have the front hole drilled, mine didnt.This thing is made from a big beefy piece of bent tubing, awesome welds and paint. Dont spend the extra money for a reese hitch. This one is top notch in my book."
5,Very nice,"A load binder or two makes install an easy 1 man, 30 minute job. It looks so much better than the square tube type, between that and the open receiver end, I'm figuring that it will collect less road debris and be less likely to rust as well. Has no trouble pulling a trailer!"
1,wish this thing would get here,"ordered March 1,2012...as of March 6,2012 the product still has NOT shipped,I need a hitch on my Ranger so I can tow my boat to the lake"
1,Poor Quality Assurance,"I bought this unit to solve a 60hz hum issue.(I have a mini-fridge and window AC unit in my AV room). It solved the hum, but the caveat was that 2 of the 8 outlets didn't work. For a unit that is valued at $800, how hard is it for them to check all the outlets before it ships out. I returned it and ended up with a APC unit that was less expensive and also had voltage regulation capability. The unit does what it says, but not any better that products for less money. Not to mention if your looking for a surge solution Brickwall surge units in combination with a legitimate UPS is really the way to go.UPS FAQhttp://www.pcguide.com/ref/power/ext/ups/typesOnLine-c.html"
4,Most Complete English Zohar,"The Zohar is the most important text of the Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition. Though there are many partial translations available, this is the most comprehensive. In 5 volumes, the authors translate about 35% of the full text of the Zohar. It only translates the main core of the Zohar, the part that interprets the Bible. The rest of the books of the Zohar are omitted. Sometimes the translation seems to be inaccurate, and notes are very sparse, so a good knowledge of Kabbalah is recommended. Comes with introduction, glossary, and explanatory essays. A good buy if you're interested in Kabbalah."
3,"Well, it's a start","While it is a herculean task, it leaves a lot to be desired. Mostly, I would have liked to see the Aramaic (or a Hebrew Translation)added to the text. It would help a lot to understand some of the things which are simply not translatable.I cannot imagine anyone who dosn't have a basic knowledge of Hebrew and/or Aramaic trying to read this text anyway.It is a good start however."
3,not complete zohar set...,if my memory serves me corectly this is not the complete set of the zohar. the entire zohar was not translated into english untill the kabbalah center finaly translated it this last 15 years. up untill that there were only 5 volumes translated into english. i would save my money and by the one put out by the kabbalah center. if you want to look at their zohar set they have the whole thing on line at [...]i would by theirs as it is the most acurate one out there.
3,Great product but some issues with assembly parts,"We were very happy with the table itself, great quality, price, it arrived promptly, etc. The issue we had was that assembly wasn't terribly easy and some of the provided parts weren't sturdy and broke during assembly. Also, the screw provided to attach the knob to the drawer wasn't long enough which is a huge pain, I don't want to deal with getting a screw that fits the knob from a hardware store. So, that is why this is a three star rating. Without those issues it would be a 5!"
5,Wonderful,"I'm so glad I stumbled onto this cartoon. Kind of a sweeter, younger Calvin (of Calvin and Hobbes). I also bought the second book."
1,Not worth buying for dog odors,I bought this product as a fresh cologne spray for doggy odors. It does not have any smell at all. Not worth it as a cologne.
1,Not what I expected.,"Same as other customers, people have problems hearing me with the built-in microphone. According to Motorola to fix this problem you have to buy the external microphone SYN5708 which is more money... not a big saving...."
1,Big disappointment,"The speaker sounds fine, but since the microphone is built into the cord, you have to hold up the phone cord to speak directly into the microphone(what's the point of cordless then). Motorola should have included an external microphone. Instead, you have to buy one... The charger works well, but overall, I would not recommend this unit."
5,Increase Your Intuition Easily,"Steve Murray makes Reiki attunements so accessible to so many. Great Idea... why aren't more Medical Intuitives sharing attunements/energy this way?Of course, as with anything, affects differ from person to person. For me it was this wonderful, warm surge of terrific energy--so very relaxing. I love the idea that I now have this DVD I can use over and over again, whenever I need a pick me up. No driving to class, no extra fees, just sit back, play, and get zapped somewhere wonderful.Thanks Steve Murray"
5,Amazing,"I am a Usui Reiki Master and was skeptical at first, but Steve made a believer out of me. I immediately experienced changes in my intuitive abilities. I shared the Psychic Attunement DVD with two other Usui Reiki Masters and they were also impressed."
1,Didn't do much for me,I did the attunement about 1 month ago and I don't notice a difference at all. I do plan on doing it again to see if it does.
5,Excellent!,"As it said, this DVD did open some doors for me. I bought it along with the first attunement. I did this one right after the first attunement. I am aware of the transformation of my consciousness and I had a blissful experience during the attunement. I will definitely follow up with his other stuff. These 2 were my ""test"" materials to see if they were for me. Thank you, Steve Murray!"
5,ATTUNEMENT,"I have noticed a change in myself since getting the attunment.Nothing spectacular, but most certainly changing. Some people develope slower than others, and my belief is that you only process what you are ready for at that time.The whole process in developing my own psychic abilities has been slow, but I certainly feel that this DVD has helped tremedously in the past three weeks!"
5,Great video! Glad I took a chance and bought it!,"It has really helped me in my psychic awareness and with my tarot readings. I do the attunement every week or so and each time I feel my awareness expanding and the energy coming through. I'm really glad I bought the video. It's the best money I have spent in a long time. What's even better I can use the video for years. If you are looking for that edge in your awareness, get this video. I'm going to buy the other two in the Reiki series for my birthday."
2,reiki,"I am relatively new to Reiki, but even so, I think this video was very basic. It is a led-meditation. I think most people could do this on their own without the video. If you've never ever meditated, then this might be for you. Otherwise, it can actually be quite distracting. I'd say read a how-to book on meditation, then just sit and do it. You'll do just as well."
5,Reiki Psychic Attunement Open and Expand your Psychic Abilities,"This Attunement is just wonderful, as are the Reiki Attunements and Reiki Ultimate Guide Books by Steve Murray. Excellent! :o)"
5,Fantastic DVD,"Steve's set of books and the two DVD's that go along with his Reiki Master program are invaluable for the Reiki Practitioner. The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements. I will use this set again and again as reference along my path of Reiki healing."
5,Amazing!!,"This disc captures the essence of the Spam Allstars!! I go every week to see them play in Little Havana...this will bring you there!! A mix of latin, dub, funk, electronic and hip-hop...you shouldnt miss it."
5,funky cuban salsa lounge music,"This disc will not only enhance whatever groove your in tenfold, but it will culturally edify your cuban american spanish palate (i.e. teaching you to say s@#t-eater in Spanish, demonstrate the vibe of ""la sowesera"" or the ""southwest part"" of Miami on a hot afternoon at the dominoe park.)AND it has the BASS to back it all up and drop the B-Boys popping and locking, doing aerials, and all kindsa ferked up gymnastic sheet.Yeah.Oh. and did I mention that I've seen them tickle the Baby Boomers, whether during a mellow evening and a glass of wine, or a quick and frisky foxtrot. It can all be done to the Cuban Funky Spam Jam, man.True that!"
4,Best...AS2 Book...Ever!,"I love Actionscript, but I always have trouble understanding it for some reason. This book is so accessible and well-written! It doesn't have excess fluff or too many technical terms.The examples are easy to understand and most tutorials and lessons are laid out with a nice flow. Each subsequent chapter builds on previous chapters. This book really helped me understand AS2.It's not perfect, though. There are great hints and tips scattered throughout the pages, but not mentioned in the index. If you don't take note of where those tips are, you'll have a hard time finding them when you need them.Overall, I definitely recommend this book to intermediate AS2 programmers."
4,Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8,This book cover many of very important topics and approaches and therefore 4 stars but sometime specially after 4th chapter is hard to follow even for the intermediate level of Action Script knowledge.
5,L'extase et l'immensité,"Il y a deja 8 ans que jai cet album et franchement je l'écoute encore regulierement. Il s'Agit de l'album le plus accompli de Mylene. Les textes sont d'une beauté, la musique brillante et meme apres 8 ans le son est tres actuel. Il contient des petits chefs-d'oeuvres comme désenchantée, il n'y a pas d'ailleurs qui est incroyable, beyond my control et nous souviendrons nous. Tout de cet album est parfait, et le regard que mylene a sur la pochette...a faire glacé n'importe qui...Un chefs-d'oeuvres qui marquera l'histoire de la musique francaise...juste a penser au single qui en on été extrait."
3,With all due respect..,"Well produced, with some fine in studio work, if you are inclined to a slow melodic,romantic, euro / disco mood, vaguely reminiscent of a gay bar in the 70's,or dark wet french street at 3 A.M, with little diversion in tempo or tonal variation between cuts, aside from techno background creations in seemingly every orchestrational format,which seem to key this album, aside from mylen's obvious talent,all well done,but a bit too repetituous.."
4,"Good stuff, beautiful voice","My friend got me too listen to Mylene first. I was reluctant, having never been a francopile, and having recoiled in cringing horror at most euro-pop I'd heard. Mylene's pieces however are different, often seeming to be colored with a very genuine sense of melancholy. Mylene has a very beautiful and versatile voice, and most of the songs are very pleasing. I could, however, do without Psychiatric and Beyond My Control. It's a personal taste thing, and this is a personal review. Maybe I'm being a little stingy with 4 stars... I'd rate it 9 of 10, were that an option. But it's not, and I'm therefore saving a rating of 5 for those albums that border upon absolute perfetion... a personal thing, again."
4,This Should Stick with You,"Half way through this film I wasn't convinced. It seemed to be a pretentious attempt at poking fun at born-agains (and I'm not religious by any means). But by the end I was left unsettled and the film lingered on for days.The twists are great and the the suspense builds up nicely. The acting is great all around (though Bernal should stick to Spanish-language films as his accent came out at parts and his mannerisms are very ""Mexico City-ish"").If you are looking for something disturbing and thought-provoking, then this is worth a view."
2,The King,"The movie was kind of ""weird"", but that's a film issue, not Amazon's. Your service was great and no problems, but the product/DVD had a pause in it where it wouldn't move forward until I pushed the Forward button on my remote control several times---I believe the DVD was scratched. I didn't return it because it would be more work than just retiring it."
4,THE KING'S STAR POWER,"Gael Garcia Bengal has proved over and over again how fine a actor he is. I got lost in this performance because he effortlessly played a character of little sympathy. I almost missed that he was playing a sociopath.I couldn't quite understand his choice and perspicuous leaving from the army. Elvis the character Mr.Bengal was playing; it was not clear why he left the army. The subliminal choice of joining may have been for the regiment and officious nature of the army. My supposition is that a sociopath least best place is in the army during war.To return to the bulk of the story without giving it away. Elvis basically is in search of his biological father. Played with profundity by William Hurt, one of his best rolls in years. This journey is rather roundabout; eventually his relationship is known and the film jumps in high gear. Mr. Bengal as usual is worth the price of a movie or DVD."
3,It's ok,"I got this product for my guide dog who is starting to get a little barky. I hoped that it could stop her from barking before it got incessant, but she gets away with the little wolfs without it responding at all. Perhaps if she barked over and over it would correct her, but for her small spaced out wolfs, it seems to have no effect. I give it 3 stars because I think it would work if the vibrations in the dog's throat continued for more than a couple of seconds."
3,worked for a while but did not last long,"I bought this as my 6 yrs old JRT started suffering from seperation anxiety recently. He barks and barks and barks and barks... when we are not at home. Received lots of complaints from angry neaighbours. He is not alone at home, there is another puppy to keep him company.The collar works wonderfully initially. However, it stopped working after about 2 months. At first we thought that battery was low thus changed a new battery. But, it still doesn't work. I tried testing it by rubbing it against a rough surface, only sound and light, no static or whatsoever.The device was also too big for my 5 kg JRT. I tried tightening the collar till I can't insert a finger, but he still managed to shake it and moved the sensor to the back of his neck.Waste of money and it is really expensive here in Singapore, about S$140. But we haven't got much choice coz this is the only brand of static collar they sell here."
1,Not Affective,"I bought this for my beagle/bassett mix. When I put this on her and she barked she shook her head at first and continued to bark through it. It did not have enough power to actually cause her enough discomfort to stop. I put it away after it stopped working, I thought perhaps the batteries were dead and replaced them, it still did not work. I tried to return it to the store to exchange it, but the company demands that you ship it back directly to them. It was bad enough that my dog was annoying with her barking, it was even more annoying to spend $120 on a product that didn't work, and then broke, and then I couldn't even exchange it. Not worth it."
2,Careful! Does your dog suffer from Separation Anxiety?,"Although this product may work with certain barking behaviours (for example: territorial barking, attention seeking etc), it can't be stressed enough that this is not a solution if your dog is suffering from Separation Anxiety. It does not deal with the reasons behind the barking. Instead, it just makes your pet even more anxious whilst you are gone and eventually intensifies the problem. Please check this fact before using this type of collar in order to avoid further negative developments."
2,Hopelessly worthless,"This collar isn't worth the effort, or money. It worked for about a week for me, I even bought an extra pair of batteries. After a couple successful days of use, and the dog actually did respond positively to the collar, it stopped shocking her. I tried switching batteries, the collar just refused to shock her when she barked.I'd say for larger dogs, this collar would work fine. But for my 15 pound dog, either the collar stopped functioning correctly or she's just too small. Regardless, I can't recommend this product to anyone for a dog of any size."
1,Did not work at all,"I bought this when it was on sale because my dog barks constantly. He is about 60lbs and does not have particularly long or thick fur. He did not react at all to this collar. We followed the instructions and made sure that it was functioning, but it had no effect."
1,pbc-302 bark control,I had purchased a bark control training system before and it was the same type as model as the the one I just bought PBC-302THEY HAVE CHANGED THE BUCKLE AND IT DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THERE ORIGNAL BUCKLE.(IT KEEPS COMING OFF OF MY DOG NECK)
1,not worth the money,"this product is useless- it promised to get my dog to stop barking. he's been wearing it for 2 months and he is still barking- i've tried replacing the battery twice, but nothing helps. the signal is obviously not strong enough yet there is no way to adjust the signal to make it stronger. and then just yesterday the plastic latch broke so i can't even use it at all unti i replace the latch, which i don't think i'm even going to bother to do"
4,This product works,"First I tried the citronella spray collar. The first day my dog was confused and he did not bark. By day two, he figured it out and it was no longer a deterent. By day three, I think he actually liked the spray.I was initially put off by the ""curelty factor"" of a shock collar, but something had to be done to curb his barking and calm my angry neighbor. I have to say, it works just as advertised. It does not administer a prolonged shock, but instead gives a quick 'sting' followed by a pause that allowes the dog to learn to stop barking. After 3 days, he only needed the collar when left alone in the yard. Now, he almost never wears it at all. This is a very good and very effective training tool, and is in no way some kind of doggie torture device."
2,not as good as previous model,"this model doesn't work as the previous model of same manufacturer; in fact, I was able to fix the old collar and put this new one aside. Maybe it is size of the dog; my german shephard is 110# and doesn't feel the effect of this collar."
4,First Amazon purchase:- excellent service,This was our first Amazon purchase and we were thrilled with the price of the product and the speed in which it was shipped to us. We had already used the product before and it is very effective in stopping a barking Jack Russle. We would certainly purchase products using Amazon again.
3,Works but not strong enough,I have purchased many dog collars but purchased this one to save a little money. It worked well as the dog was quiet but she soon was back to barking. I verifed that baby was still working. My Beagle/Jack Russel Terrier mix is very much in the stubborn dog class. I would reccomend this product for many dogs but just not for my pooch.I will buy the collar that I used to purchase which is the PetSafe PDBC-300. Or thats the type of one I used to buy before from Petsafe.
3,Not as effective as the 300,"I am using this collar on a 17-pound female Westie. It works, but is less consistent than the 300 version I use for our 40-pound Corgi. The single static contact does not consistently contact the skin (through the rather thick Westie hair), even when I attach the collar quite snugly -- any more snug and it would be very uncomfortable for the dog. Another drawback as vs. the 300 is that the only way I can figure out to preserve battery life when not using the collar is to remove the battery. For relatively little more investment, I think the 300 is the better product."
5,saved from eviction,"This works, it mitigated my dogs barking. Even if he wears a differant collar he still thinks it will shock him. I think they should start to market these for humans."
2,Not happy,"This collar worked for about 4 months and then stopped working. Fortunately I still have the original packing and proof of purchase. However, the Pet Smart Store would not give me an exchange or refund my money for the defective collar. They said I had to contact the manufacture, Radio Systems. After a lengthy phone conversation with Radio Systems customer service, they agreed to send me a new color for $18.00 and I promised to send the defective collar back to them. RS will not refund the cost to ship their defective product back to them. The cost to send the defective collar back is my cost.Radio Systems charged me $40 not $18 for the replacement collar. So now I have to have another long conversation to get my refund. I am not happy with the product, and not happy with their warranty service. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Seemed to Work Great in the Beginning, but...","I've had this collar for a while now... maybe a year or so, no more than two years. I thought that it had been working okay. It was certainly stopping her from barking most of the time (she's very territorial and barks at every moving thing around). Note that I say it only stopped her most of the time. The collar didn't pick up on every bark. Recently, however, the collar has had some serious sensor malfunctions. She'll bark for a solid minute before she gets a correction (this is on a new battery). More serious, however, is that she gets a correction seemingly at random. I was concerned that in the year I've been using this collar, Bubbles never ever got the hint that barking caused the correction, and now I'm seriously worried that it's because of this random shocking.I wish I could take it back, but the best I can do right now is hope you read this and decided to spend a little more on a collar that you won't have to use forever."
1,Arrived Defective,"We had great hopes for this collar for our constantly barking boxer. It did not work at all! The battery is fine, as we can rub it against a VERY rough surface and it will beep and work but it does not respond to our dog's bark at all. It is no where near sensitive enough. Given the other reviews, I think it must be defective and we are contacting the company for a replacement."
5,Bark Control Miracle,"Our barker stopped immediately after we put his collar on him, and continued to be quiet and docile for a while even after we removed it. We felt as though he had a complete personality change into a sweet lovable affectionate little guy from the annoying noisy nuisance he had been. Sometimes just showing him the collar quiets him down. We heartily endorse this humane way to control a bad habit."
3,Doesn't work for all the dogs,"Short of shaving my dog's neck, the collar doesn't seem to affect him through his fur. It does help on my other dogs, but my real barker seems oblivious to it. I think I need Ceasar Milan."
4,Works well to train litte dogs not to bark needlessly,"I was hesitant to try this. But I have 5 small dogs and as most people know, they LOVE to bark at the wind and the air! The adjustable collar is fantastic, just do NOT cut it too short before trying it on all your dogs. ANyway, I followed the instructions perfectly and it works on all of the little fellows. Great Product and shipped fast."
5,This thing is amazing!,"I have a very yappy Bichon. ONE ZAP and this dog stopped barking. He hasn't made a peep for 3 days. That said, DO NOT leave your dog unattended with this collar on... at least until you know how they react. If the dog continues to bark it will continue to zap. This is not intended to be used as a torture device. It's a training tool, and it's not going to work on every animal. If the dog is not responding, remove the collar. Also, there's literature in the package that says not to leave the collar on for extended periods of time to reduce the risk of irritation.Disclaimers aside, this is wonderful. It's really made being in the same room with this pup more enjoyable."
1,no bark collar,this collar does not hold up to the standards that it claims. it does not work at all. my dog is a medium size beagle and it has no effect on it at all. total waste of money
4,amazing dog collar,"After we purchased this, we actually switch it around for 4 different dogs. The younger dogs, both under 1, responded amazingly. The 2 older dogs do well when they have it on but sure know when it is off. All in all, this was a great purchase and am considering getting another one."
1,Hit or miss,Bought this for my young husky. I don't know if her fur was too long or what but she could bark and whine 90% of the time with out it going off. It worked properly about 4% of the time and the remaining 6% it would go off if she was running or playing. Completly unhappy with this product. I would not recommend this to anybody.
2,"Decent, but would recommend a different model","I recommend you spend the extra money and get the model with adjustable settings. I had that one for years, but replaced it with this one - not nearly as effective"
5,Was very please with the product,On Thanksgiving day was the first time I went out on three weeks and my mini poodle didn't bark...I adopted my mini poodle from the shelter. He is a great dog in every way..But except when Ieft we would bark his head off and I just couldn't have it because I live in apartment building.. But so farThe product has been great!!!!
4,It seems to be working well,"Our dog is an 8 yr old Bouvier female that went with us,of course, when we moved into elderly housing. The transition was somewhat difficult for her since it was a move from a large home with walled back yard to an apartment with a 20 ft coveredpatio and fenced in. Her barking bothered neighbors when we left for any period of time and the outdoor barking also interrupted an afternoon Veterans Day meeting. When used, it appears to be working because when we arrive home, shegreets us with a little whimper and is very happy to have the collar off. She is also smart enough to stop barking before theshock goes too far up the scale..."
3,Disappointed,"This collar worked very well for our dog,UNTIL the battery died. We replaced the battery and the collar would not work with a new battery. So,it works great until the original battery dies. Very disappointed."
1,Did not work,"This did nothing to stop my dog from barking. I adjusted it, checked batteries, and nothing. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive one."
4,My dog stopped barking!,"Great product. At first it dint worked and we found out that it was too loose. I have a very little dog, so we tight up the collar, and now she doesn't bark when she is using it."
4,petsage no bark collar,"this item works very well, we have been using this item for several weeks and our dog is barking less"
1,Never worked even out of the box,"This collar never worked. I thought it might be the batteries, so I spent $10.00 on a new one - still didn't work. We ended up getting an innotek - and that worked perfectly right out of the box. Wouldn't waste the money on this unit."
5,Happy owner of a non-barking dog,This is great! I would recommend this to everyone! It's wonderful to have the mailman deliver in peace and quiet. Just hope it last......
5,PeSafe No-Bark collar,TRIED ALL THE TRAINING TIPS AND MY WESTIE STILL WOULD BARK AT THE SLIGHTEST THING.HE LEARNED QUICKLY AND LIFE IS GOOD NOW. IT ALLOWS FOR A BARK OR TWO BUT DISCOURAGES EXCESSIVE BARKING AND SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS BARKING IN GENERAL. BEST $40 I EVER SPENT !
2,"Petsafe was great, collar not so much","Unfortunately when I received the collar it was not functional. After talking to customer support I went and bought a new package of batteries with still no luck. Customer support at Petsafe then sent me a new collar, which was in working condition free of charge. Still unsure what was faulty with the first one, it was not beeping when ran across a rough surface."
3,"Doesn't last long, but effective","We ordered this collar for our mini schnauzer who continually barked at our neighbors who were outside enjoying their yard. It worked for a while but unless you wipe off the unit and your dog on a daily basis (as it states in the instructions) its not going to last very long. If you don't plan on moving ever, then it will work out fine because your dog will learn not to bark even when the collar doesn't work."
2,ouch!,"I had tried a petsafe sonic collar with minimal success. This one, the Petsafe PBC 102 no bark collar seemed to be a step beyond the sonic collar with no ill effects. Tell that to my three year old dog. Yesterday the collar moved to the highest level (it appeared) causing her to yelp loudly for 10-15 seconds and because she didn't know what was causing the pain, she attacked our other dog!! NEVER again will I trust Persafes descriptions of their products. NEVER again will I subject any animal to their ""static vibration"". I would not recommend this or any Petsafe product to anyone. I am really floored that something which promised such great results physically hurt my dog as badly as it did."
4,Scared dogs,"The collar works great on my two labs, although i should not have been cheap and bought two of them. The biggest problem that I have seen is the collar scares the living daylights out of my dogs, and it kind of broke their spirits. It was sad, but it works! When the collar is on, they dont bark. The battery has not worn out yet, as it only took a shock or two to get them to stop!"
1,DO NOT USE THESE COLLARS - WAY TOO HARMFUL,"I spoke to a number of people in person and looked online extensively before I bought the collar. Concerned it was too harsh, I was reassured it is a mild corrective. That was completely untrue. After two bark shocks, our dog retreated into a shell. He wore the collar a total of five minutes and I will regret those five minutes the rest of my life. DO NOT USE these collars. He didn't bark for a week and also lost a great deal of his energy and enjoyment. Before this collar he would chase and retrieve balls, giving an excited bark at the beginning. He gave up completely after associating his excitement bark with pain. These products should be banned."
2,used one time,I used it one time and after I toked it off my dog will never let me put that thing back on her.
2,Pet safe?,"I have two dogs, and I got one of these collars, first they were a little surprise and stop a little ,, now I have to hear the beep plus the barking, it beeps if they jump, it beeps, if they run, I was watching them play with out barking and I hear the beeeeeep, I feeli sorry for them, i don't use it any more and I have to take of the battery because I hear it beeping were ever it is"
1,Dangerous - buyer beware!,"I returned this item for two main reasons:1. Dog can only wear anti-bark collar alone, you must remove regular collar. In doing so you remove all ID tags. Not good.2. If you dog is furry it does not work, and you have to shave their neck where the collar connects. I don't THINK SO!Perhaps if you have a dog without long fur and you don't mind them going without any dog tags, then go for it.I won't be using it on my precious pup ~"
4,Works great,"I bought this for a new dog that was 8 yrs old. The dog is a border collie that is very high strung. I couldn't keep him in the back yard with my aussie dog without him barking. I worried about neighbors complaining and there is a barking ordinance for only 15-20 minutes in the city I live in. I can take him in the car and not worry about him going crazy with barking. I tried this collar and found him making a more panting sound instead of barking sound. We love it! He learned very quickly. I didn't want him to get shocked from another dog barking. The vibration feature is great, it works only if it senses he is barking, not another dog. I only wish the button was easier to use for turning the collar unit off."
1,Open wounds on neck,This product left open wounds on my medium sized Jack Russell's neck. This is an inhumane product that has caused her pain and a possible infection.
3,"Have several that I purchased before this one, which have been good, this one is a bit inconsistent",This particular collar isn't working as well as previous collars of the same brand. Would also be nice if the collar would adjust a bit smaller.
5,Great safe way to prevent barking!,"I really like the product. It helped my dog stop barking. It was a little painful to see it work the first time, but after that it worked wonders."
1,TRY IT ON YOURSELF FIRST.,"I ordered this last week to reduce my dog's nuisance barking. Before applying it to my pup, i decided to try it on myself. I almost dropped the thing because the shock was so strong, it was the equivalent of touching an electric socket. Returning this abusive collar asap."
1,why bother?,"i have a small dog with a high pitch bark, the unit NEVER works on the dog, and only works if you rub the contact points across the carpet, i dont see how any dogs barking could set this thing off, a remote controll zapper would work much better"
3,citronella bark guard collar,"This pet safe no bark collar is just ok. It does not work on small dogs. I tried it out on 2 dogs who weigh about 5 kilo and 6 kilo and it kept slipping away from the throat. I read the instructions carefully and it just was not suitable. I think it may work better on a medium to large dog. I would not recommend it for small dogs at all. We thought it was broken as it just would not work, so my teenager tried it on himself and it worked and of course gave him a shock and he said a shock that was not suitable for a small dog."
4,Quiet Back yard,"I have to say, I didn't think these would work for our dogs. But they do! I am so amazed, our back yard is now a peaceful place."
2,My dogs ate them!,I have two dogs that love barking and are in a 10X10 enclosure when I'm at work. I bought these collars after my neighbors complained they barked while I was gone......they lasted 3 days....My dogs hated them and decided to tear them off of each other....I'm now out $100 and they are still barking....:(
2,Didn't work on my papillon. :(,"The collar is to heavy to stay in place (no matter how tight) on my dog. It only works 1 out of 5 barks and he didn't stop barking. However, the company is AWESOME. I called them and they sent me a replacement collar immediately. Unfortunately the 2nd collar worked only as good as the first one. I can see if it fit his neck better that it would work. It just doesn't work on my dog."
4,Works most of the time,"I think part of the reason I am having trouble wit this product not working consitantly is because my dog is pretty small. She is a Min Dauschaund and barks A LOT. Sometimes the collar does not pick up her barks but it seems to catch more than it misses. Despite the missed barks she has already decreased her barking attmepts considerably, even when she is not wearing the collar. Overall I would say the collar works great, just make sure your dog is above the minimum weight suggestion shown for the collar."
4,Amazing results,"Beagle that barked and howled unnecessarily. Checked on several sites for different products, saw positive reviews on the PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark Collar, ordered it, put in on Beagle day the product arrived and after ONE bark ---no more unnecessary barking and howling! Thanks!!"
2,Battery that comes with this collar does not work!,"I had a Petsafe dog collar for years, but the PETSAFE Batteries were made in 2006 and began to last shorter and shorter time. Those I am being sold today in 2011 are STILL PETSAFE Batteries manufactured 2006 in China. (5 Year old batteries that will not work over a couple of days,)I purchased this new collar expecting a NEW BATTERY with it--Silly Me!!!!The EXTRA batteries Amazon offered from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER through AMAZON came today, and--You're right, WHEN WERE THEY MADE??? Same thing. Made 2006 in China, under the PetSafe logo. Will they work??Well, I'm going to try these out a few more days---Eternal optimist that I am--But I expect I'll be returning both Collar & Batteries soon, the way this deal is going--.I fell really let down because the collar advertised has new features that I would really appreciate."
4,Great Item for a small neck,"My dogs neck is very long and skinny (italian greyhound). I had read on many reviews of other products similar to this that the actual ""shock"" part of the collar spins around, this one does not. It allows you to cut the collar as small as you need it. Even when he shakes his head it stays in place. I put it on my dog for 2 hours while I was home to test it out and it worked immediately when he barked. 2 barks in 2 hours and nothing more. He does not bark alot just at small noises so the batteries have held up fine for me. I would reccommend this collar for anyone with the same problems as me."
1,No-Bark Collar Does not work!!,We bought this PetSafe no-bark collar in Jan 2011 and received it in Feb 2011. We have so far gone through 5 batteries and it still does not stop our shepard from barking. I have taken it to Petco and they tell me they really don't work on all dogs or it could be defective because they have had some returned for the same reason I writting about it.So unhappy with this product! I wish I would of researched it more befor spending the money.hotrodgal............
3,Faulty Battery,"This bark collar worked great for a long time. Then the battery died, we ordered new ones, but couldn't remove the original battery. Unfortunately, it's just over a year past the manufacturer's warranty expiration date. Be aware that the battery does not come off easily. We could NOT get the old battery off. We ordered new batteries, but could not remove the old one, so the collar is now useless. I called the company directly and all they would do is replace it with a new one for just over $40 which is what I paid for it on Amazon, so not a great deal. Very frustrating to have something that worked so well have to be thrown in the trash."
4,Petsafe no-bark collar,I was very reluctant to use a zap collar but bought this one as my dog got used to the spray collar. I have only had it for a couple of days and it appears very effective.
2,PetSafe PBC-102 No-Bark Collar,We have a thick-haired Siberian Husky.We will need to cut her hair because the sensoris not capable of making contact with her sense of touch.This was a Christmas gift.
1,Evil.,"Before you put this on your pet, give it a try. Touch both sensors and rub the middle black bar on a rough surface. OUCH. Maybe for a large long hair breed this wouldn't be completely awful, but for a small dog or short hair breed, this would straight up hurt. My hand is still not right 30 minutes after trying it myself. Taking it back ASAP."
1,Item as purchased from Amazon does not function,"Purchased this item from Amazon. The item passes its troubleshooting check (making a tone when its terminals are passed over a rough surface per the manual), but does not issue any shock to the dog. To verify, I bought additional batteries, with the same outcome.This product is defective."
1,Australia prohibited product list,"Australian Customs confiscated this as a prohibited product, deemed as animal cruelty. I was surprised as someone in the ratings reviews said it was only a mild buzz that it gave out on the person's skin, as he had tested it. So if you live in Australia, don't buy this product. My daughter in USA had recommended it as working on one of her 2 dogs, but when she mailed it to me in Australia, of course, it never reached me, (so much for ""Pet Safe"".) You would be far better off putting your money on the gee-gees....(horses)!"
1,Collar too large,"After reading about the effectiveness of this product and the ability for small dogs to wear it, we ordered it. However, after we received it in the mail we found that it did not not fit on either one of our dogs."
2,batteries don't last,I bought this for my dog and used it for a couple days and the batteries wore out really fast! and After a couple days my dog wasn't even barking that much. I was not impressed with this unit.
2,Bak collar,This collar does not work as I expected. Battery wears down quickly and to replace it you have to buy a special replacement from petsafe.
4,Correction collar for my Jack Russell Terrier,"I have not had to use this collar yet. I have purchased PetSafe products before and I have always been pleased with results. I have a very ""barky"" Terrier...When we are out fishing on a quiet peaceful lake, he will not stop barking at EVERYTHING...So I really hope this collar will help."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"This product does not work. I've tried multiple batteries and the best I could get was that my dog would get a continual shock! Basically torturing my little dog. I then tried it on a pit bull thinking my little dog was just to sensitive, but the pit bull also instantly started cowering and wineing. This is not a product that should be used on any animal. This is not just an opinion but a fact. I understand having one or two in a bad batch but I read further reviews back and it seems this often happens after a longer period of use. And if your not home your dog could be damaged or even killed by the continual stress of the continuing shock. Unless you can monitor the collar at all times to make sure it doesn't have a ""glitch"" it is irresponsible to put this on any pet. Go ahead try it on your self, if you dare."
1,Burned,"Bought two of these..only lasted a cupple weeks.... Definitely not safe, it seemed to have burned my dog. They need to make one that is 100% safe.... This item is Not safe don't buy it unless u wanna risk burning a scar onto your pup"
2,Works but...,"My father bought this product for their 11 year old adopted beagle/hound mix. The collar definitely shocks when she barks, so it does work- HOWEVER, it only senses the vibrations on the throat, not an actual bark. So after the dog barked, it shocked her so she whimpered and it shocked her again stronger so she cried again and it was just an awful, horrible circle until I was able to take it off her. It also will shock if the dog just sneezes. I understand that sometimes with heavy barkers, they need to be helped and trained not to bark as often as they do, but this is certainly not a helper. The collar is now in the garbage and I will be buying them the spraying one instead. And just a side thought, if it was as harmless of a shock as it says, most things don't cry or whimper unless their being hurt."
1,Product Works but Company lies,"This product is a shock collar, plain and simple. Put it up to your neck, make a barking noise and you get a jolt, certainly not a static shock as they claim. That was their marketing department. I called the company about their claim to be able to lower the shock amount and was told go to radio shack and they will have a resister. I went to radio shack and they laughed. It is one piece plastic and the idea of soldering a resister in is foolish. While the product works, the comanies lack of honesty makes me give an overall D-. Don't let their false marketing sell you. If you want a shock collar purchase it from an honest company."
1,Disappointed,"The product didn't work at all. Plus, even if it did, I wouldn't have liked the concept... it's not the dog's bark that signals the collar to work, it's just movement. Which would mean that every time the dog moved, it could potentially punish the dog for it's movement, and not just the bark."
3,Not bad at all,"A good product, definitely keeps the dog from barking! My dog is smaller though, and the collar seems to loosen around his neck over time. Also the unit itself seems to bulky and somewhat heavy for him, though his weight was over the minimum requirement recommended by the product. I do recommend this product."
1,Not the product for my pet!,"Chose product because my daughter had had good results using it on her toy poodle. However, did not work out for my toy poodle. First and only time I used it, I thought I was going to kill him! He barked and then started screaming (yes, screaming)and running around like he was possessed. He bit two of us as we tried getting it off of him. Probably should have used the remote control style collar instead."
2,Quit working after one week,I bought two collars. One of the collars quit working after one week. I was able to return to Amazon for a refund. Both of my dogs continued to bark even with the collars on.
1,Total Waste of Money & Time,"This collar did nothing to stop my dog from barking. I even tried changing batteries and it still did not work. My dog ignored it. I eventually bought a PetSafe PDBC-300 with the push button adjustments, which was similar to the old dial type that wore out that I was replacing and it is working fine."
4,"To woof or not to woof, that is the question.....","My dog is probably thinking just that when he has his No-Bark collar on. He still barks a bit but it has become much less of a problem. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the collar didn't perform a miracle but it was close! I was like many other people, timid about having my ""baby"" zapped. But this collar is just a little bit of a reminder that he needs to keep his voice down and I am relieved that it is working."
2,Be Aware,Read the small print. You must buy replacement batteries from PetSafe. You cannot simply buy a battery and replace it. You need the battery holder that has the battery enclosed in it!
3,Bark Collar,"I found out my dog would go outside and bark and howl for hours when he was left home alone, When I came home one day three policecars were at my house. I was shocked and had to resolve the problem fast so I bought this to solve it and in about three days he stopped the barking completly. He don't even think about barking now 2 weeks later my neighbors are happy with the collar and so am I it really works. {Due to the amount of batteries it suddenly started going through I changed it to a 3 star from a 5 }....."
1,"Works, but battery life sucks!","This product will do the job, but you have to buy Petsafe specific batteries, which are expensive and do not last long. I have been buying the batteries from the pet store and sometimes they don't even last a week! If I wasn't out of the full refund return window, I'd be returning this product."
1,Ouch,"I bought this thinking it would be good to quiet down our Westie. Before trying it on her, I put one thumb on each lead and activated it and SZZZZZT OUCH! I could never inflict such pain on our little girl. I returned it (and thank you Amazon for paying return shipping)."
2,bark collar,"I purchased 2 automatic zap collars, 1 for each dog. 1 collar seemed to work ok, but the other was overly sensitive and activated when my dog was not barking. It really frightened the poor thing so much that she wouldn't move the entire day; not even to come over for a treat. So I returned the collars, and to Amazons credit, they did give me a full refund. I think I may try the remote collars next time."
1,Definately wouldn't reccomend for a small dog AT ALL,"Got this for my miniature dachshund who tends to bark like crazy. Thought this might be a good solution, since I have tried many types of training and such. The vet actually recommended one, so I decided to try it. I used the product twice before I returned it. The first time he had it on he barked a few times before it even when off, then a small yelp followed. He barked again and got shocked so severely he freaked out and started going nuts barking and yelping in pain. Same result the second time around. I immediately returned this product. I do not recommend this for small dogs at all and am very disappointed in the product. Half the time it did go off (unless he barked very loud) and when it did go off it hurt my dog and made him go nuts. And yes I followed all the fitting instructions given. Not highly recommended."
4,Works great,"Seems to work great. Dog's barking has been reduced quite a bit, and he doesn't seem to mind it at all."
1,Does not work.,"I followed the directions and it simply didn't work. It states: To activate it turn the battery in the proper position and slide it across a semi rough surface and it will beep. It does beep, however when I put it on my dog, which has short/little hair on his neck, with a proper tightness, it does not initiate a shock at all. He has a very loud bark and I am severely disappointed in this product. Buyers beware, don't waste your money."
1,Pretty Worthless,"This worked effectively for about an hour. Then when our dog started barking again, the red warning light didn't even come on. We tightened the collar, followed the instructions in the trouble-shooting guide, and even rushed out to purchase a new replacement battery (for a product that had been opened that day fyi - the battery shouldn't need replacement). Still, nothing. How can a brand new device crap out after only an hour of use??? I'm returning this immediately."
1,No battery,"I ordered this product and it did not come with the battery as promised. Now, not only did I have to pay 7 dollars to order a battery, but have to wait even longer to use the product. The misrepresentation is explicit and I would have thought Petsafe would be more concerned about customer satisfaction."
2,Good while it lasts...,"Have used e-collars with great success for training dogs - please, no whining from the positive reinforcement only camp. My go-to brand is Tri-Tronics products - very sturdy and good service if something breaks, which is rare.Pet-Safe No-Bark Collar worked very well but DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. Don't know if mine was a lemon, or if others have had this problem."
2,Transmitter larger than stated,"I bought this from Amazon for my 8lb poodle. When I received it I did not open the package as the transmitter appeared larger than the stated size. Upon measuring it, I found that it was larger than stated. It just looked too large for my dogs neck so I returned it. Amazon is easy to work with on returns luckily so that was not an issues. I would not attempt to buy one of these online again unless I had seen that model in person."
4,Very effective,"I have a malti-poo, and this collar works wonders. Put it on, and the dog stops barking, take it off, and he'll bark at the neighbors' dogs all day long.Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the product instructions direct you not to leave the collar on the dog for more than 12 hours at a time. Would like to have a ""permanent"" solution"
1,Awful,This purchase was a total waste of money. These batteries test capatable but did not work with bark collar. I have a rottie and with her loud barks the batteries didnt pick up anything to deliver a shock. Super dissapointed. Bought Pet Safe brand again and collar works great.
4,Pet Bark Control,This is the second one of this product we have purchased. The first one lasted 2 years but got trashed by the dog somehow. We only use it early mornings or late at night when we do not wish to disturb neighbors. She can and has barked through it ( most likely when she had a close encounter with wildlife-we live in a forrest) but it works the best of any systems we have tried.
1,No good,I tested on a rough surface as the instructions manual indicated and everything was fine but on my dog does not work at all.
2,no good,"I've already gone through 6 batteries & today it died within 10 hours. Because it eats through batteries so fast, my dog isn't scared of it anymore."
4,Oops Purchase,I ordered this with my chihuahua mix and terrier mix in mind. The units are too big. But have used PetSafe for four years on a very stubborn dog with great success in controlling barking. PetSafe units work even in the front yard with people constantly walking by.
5,Awesome collar...,My dog is learning super fast to stop barking. The kids and I tried it first to make sure it wouldn't hurt our little girl. (Don't try this at home ;) ). She's sees the collar and automatically knows not to bark.
5,Awesome,This worked so well I bought another one for my other dog. I am very pleased with this product and I would definitely purchase again.
1,"Open sores, ineffective training","We had our beagle wearing it full-time until we discovered the sores on her neck. It worked mostly - sometimes she would bark for a whole minute or two and THEN get shocked.In order to give the sores some time to heal, we decided to put it on her only during neighborhood quiet hours (we both work the midnight shift). Well, she's not stupid and quickly discovered that she could bark all she wanted as long as she wasn't wearing the collar (which was during the day, when shift-workers are trying to sleep).I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're into hearing your dog scream in pain while electrical contacts drill into her neck. Not to mention that by the looks of it, the dog would have to wear it forever, which in my mind is unacceptable as a training method. If you do buy this product, make sure you try it out on yourself first."
1,Avoid the collar and the company,"""PetSafe"" goes out of its way to avoid calling this collar what it is: a painful shock-delivery system. Words like ""static correction"" and ""tingle"" are carefully chosen to give the impression that something other than outright electrical shock is involved. I tested the contacts on my own skin before putting it on my dog and leapt away in astonishment at the level of the shock delivered by the electrodes.The company failed to respond to two email requests for product return information. When at last we contacted them by phone, my wife was rudely informed that no return would be considered for an opened product.Unless you are interested in torturing your pet and supporting an unethical company, I recommend looking elsewhere for bark-correction solutions."
1,I cannot recommend this product,"We followed the instructions to a T, but our dog barks as if she has no collar at all. In face, there is never a moment when she is quiet enough for us to reward her for not barking. We could wake her up while she sleeps, but she wouldn't know what we were doing."
5,Fantastic - works great!,"I bought this in July of 2009 and it is still working great (it's now December 2010). It keeps our German Shepherd quiet when needed and the batteries last a long time. It just works (at least it sure does for our dog). I can only remember replacing the battery once or twice during the time I've had it, but we don't use it every day.UPDATE 2011-11-29: Still working great, but we only use it when needed, probably 2-5 times a month."
2,8 lbs and up!,"Product decription indicated ""perfect for toy or small breeds"", Just make sure your ""toy or small breed"" is over 8lbs as per warrning message on packaging. Our little toy breed is 4 lbs, had to send back."
1,Waste of money,Two of three ordered never worked and the third only worked for three days. I regret this purchase and also regret wasting my money.
2,Not worth it,"Our dog got jumped and barked because he was scared the first time he was shocked. We couldn't get him to stop. However, the company says to cut off extra collar length so the strap doesn't create a vibration and shock the dog. That also made it so we couldn't return the collar. Not worth the hassle!"
4,this collar works,"this collar works great. I have a dog that barks & will not stops untill you play w/ him, this drove me & my family nuts. When my family saw the collar they were very sceptice that it would hirt the dog, but after reading the booklet that came with it i asurred them it was human. Will it worked , now when he gets wond-up and wont lisson to comands & he even see the collar in my hane , he backs bown. he still basrks without it , but it works when it's on."
4,Annette,The collar works great on my yorkie. He has figured out that he can whine before he gets zapped but it has curbed the barking whenever he has it on.
4,Works for deep barking.,"My dog has a very high pitched bark, that is very loud and I thought that this product would help out with that but it doesn't, it only catches the barks that are deep. I don't know how to describe the barks it catches, they are just deep low barks. It doesn't correct her for the high pitched ones.So yes, it works and if my other dog had this problem it would be 5 stars and perfect all day everyday, but it's not on that dog."
1,Battery dies with every use.,"I bought several extra batteries thinking this would last me at least a year, maybe two. Nope. Lasted me less than a month! I rarely put the collar on my dog for more than 1 hour and never more than 2 hours. Each time, I take it off my dog, I make sure to turn the battery to the off position. And each time, I go to turn it back on and test it, it no longer works. It isn't the batteries because I have tried several. And it isn't the way I am turning it off, because I have removed the entire battery in between wears. This is probably defective, but they want me to wait and keep trying it. Ugh!"
2,not pleased,"We did not think this product lived up to our expectations. Our dog continued to bark. We could hear the collar beep , I don't think the correction was strong enough."
5,Love this!,"I have a very stubborn female Boxer dog who only barks when she's left alone when I'm at work (otherwise she's not a nuisance barker). Unfortunately, we have a retired couple next door who had to listen to her scream and cry all day. I tried training her not to bark and I tried the ""high pitched sound deterrent"" birdhouse. Neither worked. I picked this collar up at WalMart and thought it was worth a try without having high hopes since it was so inexpensive. I was careful about how I fit it around her neck and only use it when I'm gone during the day. It works! She would bark once, and no more! This means she's only getting the first level of correction- maybe to the second. I actually tried the collar out on my own neck and while it was certainly surprising, it was not painful. Moral of the story: The dog is not barking and the neighbors have thanked me! Highly recommended :)"
2,Not for long haired dogs,We purchased this collar for our bark obsessed Australian Shepherd. At first it seemed to work well and she stopped barking after the first mild zap. But it became clear that unless the sensors have direct contact with their skin it doesn't register. So we had to shave her neck and even then it doesn't work well or on a regular basis. Batteries wear out very quickly making it ineffective as well.So only recommend this product for very short haired dogs.
2,NOT for small breeds!,"The description states that this product can be used on small breeds, but the instructions on the package state not to use on dogs under 8 lbs! This really should be stated on the product description page to save people such as myself the headache of having to return the item."
1,no-bark collar,"1. Included batteries were dead on arrival.2. With replacement batteries installed, collars were used as directed. They had no noticeable effect on the incessant yapping of either dog."
2,Worked for the first couple hours,"Worked fine for the first few hours, then stopped. I tried tightening it, loosening it, and trimming my dog's hair. All to no avail. Finally I thought it must have a dead battery, so I bought some more. Still the exact same thing, it didn't work at all.The manual says to test the collar, rub it on a flat surface and you'll hear a beep confirming it's working. I tested it as the manual says and did hear the beeping, but when I put it on my dog again it just would not work. I'm giving it two stars because I'm thinking it might have something to do with my dog. He's a Border Collie/Dalmatian breed. So he's a very intense dog, especially his barking. Hence, I think because he barks so much, he somehow confused the collar into not working anymore."
2,Works so so,I have two of these and they work so so. You really need to put them on tight and that concerns me. The quality is questionable. One is broken and we used it very little. The worst part is the propritary batteries it uses. It will cost you a fortune.
4,good,We ended up getting this training collar b/c my dog would start to bark and wouldn't stop... living in an apartment building with thin walls - it doesn't go well for our living situation. I like this product b/c it gives your dog a warning beep if they bark once and then it will give her a static shock. I will admit that I am not the biggest fan of shock collars but I tried it and it was a little stronger then someone rubbing their feet across the carpet and then touching bare skin. I does startle the dog and she did jump and looked a little confused but it has been a great training item. I do not keep it on her all day but only when she starts to get really crazy and I can tell her barking fits are about to start but she has learn very quickly and doesn't bark in the house anymore - only after a few uses. My only wish is that I had control over the shock level.
1,Flimsy collar is the shocker,"Amazing. For a product that works SO WELL to have such a flimsy collar is completely poor planning and poor design. We couldn't believe how well it worked for about a week until the collar actually ripped and was lost. We found it in the yard tried to tape it back on and it ripped again. It comes on the cheapest kind of thin nylon collar that no one actually would buy for their cat, let alone their dog, because it is obviously flimsy and can't last. And we can't figure out a way to put the device onto another collar. It's so disturbing because otherwise, the collar seemed like a dream come true and worked almost immediately!!!!!!!! BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!"
4,One zap,"I tried all suggested methods to stop my Cavalier's barking (at nothing and for no reason) before purchasing this collar. The first day of wearing it, he barked. Result was not a yip, just straight up with all four feet. Spirit is a fast learner and did not bark again. I've been wearing it on him for an hour or so each day and let it lay out in sight the remainder of the time. Success and quiet...thinking of pursuing a ""rent a collar"" business!"
4,Collar works,"This has helped slow down my dog's barking. She knows what happens when I put the collar on, so when she starts barking excessively, I show her the collar and she stops. Works well."
1,Horrible Experience,"My dog barks whenever we leave. We recently moved into an apartment and I want to correct the behavior. Bought the collar, did everything the directions said and left the room. He barked, then two seconds later (when the device activates) he started yelping and screeching like he was injured. I read they may react like this at first, so I waited to see if he would work it out. The screeching got worse and worse. I went to check on him and he had lost control of his bowels and bladder due to the shocks.I feel like the worst pet owner ever for trying this product."
3,Apparently not for use on really stupid dogs ...,"I have a chocolate lab, 15 years old. She is not particularly smart, per se, but she can be fairly clever. I also own a 2-year-old Australian shepherd mix ......dumb as a rock.Now, the lab, I can tell her ""No!"" when she barks, and after a couple times, she gets it. The Aussie? I think telling her no makes her get worse. So I thought this gadget might help ... uh, no: she barks, it goes off, which scares her, so she barks, which sets it off, which scares her ...You'd think, after a couple minutes, she would make the association. Nope. I'm tellin' ya, dumb. as. a. rock.So anyway, I gave it an average grade ... it did what it was supposed to. But after a couple days of this ""slapback echo"" effect, I just took it off and started looking for something else.Amazon's service on this was impeccable, as always.$.02 contributed."
1,rooster500,Hoped it would work on a small dog (12 lbs). It sounded good based on the reviews and online manual but it only works 10% of the time. The unit itself is too big and easily slides to the side of the neck and so it won't get activated when the dog barks because it is not directly on the animal's voice box. Instructions emphasize that the contact points have to touch the skin but the prongs are too long so it doesn't fit right. The unit itself is literally bolted onto the strap. Instructions say to cut the excess strap to fit the dog. Once you cut the strap you can't move the unit up or down the strap so it's awkward placing it on the animal. It probably works better on a bigger dog but definitely not on a small one.
2,Pet safe PBC-102 No bark Collor,"I would not recommend this collor for dogs with long hair. I used it on a 9 month old Malamute with no undercoat yet but the prongs still had a problem making contact with the skin (which is necessary to work effectively). To remedy this I tried to tighten the collor to create closer contact but this resulted in my dog constantly hacking and throwing up on the carpet. I next shaved my dogs neck and loosened the collar, but the shock this created for this size of dog was only slightly irratating and the barking continued. I believe this collar would be an effective tool on small shorter hair breeds, but I would avoid attemping to expect positive results on larger breeds. I'd rate it a 2 out of 5."
4,stops the bark...,"seems to work for my little pug. he was really scared when he was zapped the first few times, but now he wont bark when the collar is on, and when he's not wearing it he barks less."
4,happy big dog owner,It took only a couple of weeks and now my Doberman is a well behaved big do who only barks when it is appropiate as opposed to all the time.
1,Horrible experience,"I bought this item based on all the positive reviews it received hoping to help with my 3 year old Australian shepherds barking issue. I followed the instructions and put the collar on him. He barked at someone he saw and the collar beeped then shocked him, he jumped into the air let out a very loud cry, then it shocked him again when he cried and it repeated this over and over. He ran about the house screaming in pain like he was being skinned alive, until i could get it off of him. I feel horrible for putting this on him, buyer beware, it may just be too much for some dogs, i would recommend a remote collar so you can control the correction and not worry about this sort of thing happening. I would never buy something like this again, or recommend it."
1,Horrible customer service from PetSafe,"I ordered this product because I was desperate and rushed to have it delivered. The battery is no good despite this being a ""new"" package. Customer service at Pet Safe told me that they would send me new batteries - in 7 to 10 business days. I asked the rep if that was the best she could do considering they sold me a faulty product and I should not have to wait another two weeks to get the issue addressed. Her response was that for an additional $15 they could expedite it to me. Disgusting!!! I should pay $15 to correct their faulty manufacturing/quality control???"
4,No Bark Collar,"I really didn't want to go the route of the static shock collar but we had tried many things, squirt bottle with water, shaking a tin can with coins, walking and turning them away from the cause of the barking, really those things didn't work with my dogs they are just persistent at making their voice heard. Just took a very short time and It works! Two of my girls are no longer yappers, the third will get her new collar soon and there will be peace in the neighborhood.PetSafe No-Bark Collar, PBC-102"
4,"Great device, but......","I used one of these collars on my Whippet and my mom used one on her Terrier mix and they worked perfectly. No bad reactions from either pup, worked as hoped. I now have a beautiful Labradoodle who loves to bark at absolutely nothing.. I've worked with a trainer, but she just won't stop so I bought this collar. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, I think, her hair is too thick for the short prongs to go through to her skin. I've seen collars that have 2 sets, short and longer, but this has only short prongs. This makes it barely effective, it only worked once all afternoon and evening while she barked many times."
4,Thank goodness for this collar!,"We have a dauchshund and boy can our dog bark incessantly! Out of desperation we bought this collar. I love the results. Our dog only had to be reminded by the beep and the first level shock a couple of times, and now we don't have a problem. My only concern with this product is that if I leave the collar on when the dog comes in and shakes off the snow, it will beep and shock our dog. I have to quickly take it off before the dog shakes off the snow.Otherwise, this was a stress saver."
3,WORKS WELL - WHEN IT'S NOT BROKEN,"I've bought three of these. My large dog responded well to them - at least the first two - until they broke. The first one lasted five weeks. The vendor wouldn't take it back even with the warranty; their warranty only lasted 30 days and I missed the deadline by a couple of days. They wanted me to send it back to the manufacturer. While I was at the store, I bought another one; couldn't wait for the whole time while the first one was being fixed. The second one lasted a week. I took it back to the vendor. The indicator light said that it was working so the vendor wouldn't take it back - even though there was no shock. I went to another store and bought a third one; it seems to be the only kind sold here! It never worked at all. No light, no shock, nothing.I'm really frustrated. If I can't control my dog's barking while I'm not at home, it could be her death sentence."
3,18m old Norfolk Terrier,"My 18m old/8lb Terrier is very territorial & loves to bark at people & vehicles going past the house. This happens inside or outside the house. My wife & children are not ready to reprimand the dog yet (she's so cute....) so I tried this barking collar to help with the noise.I bought it from Amazon & used it for 3 months with marginal success.PROS: The strap & buckle are very nice, the electronics are small & lightweight, fit the neck well.The 6V battery is easy to change & comes 2 to a pack.These items are available at my local pet store but I shop online at night with Amazon.comCONS: Battery life is short. I went through the original batteries plus 2 more packs in 3 months. Boy you sure do know when the batteries are dead because the dog will tell you!I love the product size but am shopping for a different one because of the poor battery life... Too Bad!"
3,First one was a dud,The first one I got was a dud an went through 3 batteries in 7 days. Replaced it with a new one and this one seems to work really well. We got complaints from the neighbors about our barking beagle and this seems to have made the difference.
3,"Not Bad, Battery Died Quickly","I got this for my Pomeranian who will bark at anything and everything. It worked just fine for awhile, but I think eventually the shock stopped scaring him and he learned to pick his battles and fight through the pain. The battery also died after 1 month of use. Maybe it doesn't take that long for most dogs to stop barking. This is one of the more inexpensive products out there and I loved how much the collar could be adjusted. This would be a great product if it worked on my dog."
4,Solid product - effectiveness depends on the source of the barking problem.,"We've only had this product for about 10 days, but I see how effective it is.. and under what circumstances it DOESN'T work. I tried it on our 1 year old Shih-Tsu who barks at every single little noise, because he's trying to establish himself as the boss/top dog and it worked very, very well. He just stopped barking while we had it on him and we've noticed a huge reduction in his barking overall. We've also got an 8 year old terrier mix who has very tics and neurosis and he barks much of the time because he feels threatened or nervous. The bark collar forces him to bark less but doesn't stop him so we're working on that.If your dog is 'nuisance barking' just for the hell of it, this collar is an excellent solution. If there's another underlying cause then of course this collar isn't going to work a miracle, though combined with addressing those issues directly it could be very effective."
3,Seperation Anxiety cured,If you look at my other reviews you will see I own two sport dog e collars toobut if you have a dog that barks when you leave the house this should fix it in just a weeks...worth the price for what it is...I bought extra batteries since they were proprietary and I didnt want to end up with a barking dog and dead batteries and angry neighborsI am still on the original battery and my puppy no longer barks at me to come home...
4,More humane than the dog pound,"We were at odds with our negigbors and at our witts end. We did not want to take our dog to a shelter so this was a last resort for us. I bought this bark collar with no hopes of it actually working and was surprised at how well it worked. It stopped him from barking and kept him from barking even when I took it off of him. Now he knows when the collar goes on, no barking. I have never been so pleased. I highly recommend it. I have a terrier that barks way too much at any noise he hears. His barking was so bad that two of my neighbors complained of him barking all night. I tried everything from noise based bark inhibitors to citronella spray collars and nothing worked. The sonic noise didn't bother him, and he realized that the citronella would run out, so he barked till it didn't spray anymore. This product has made us all happier."
5,worked perfectly and amazingly fast....,this collar started paying for itself from the first bark my puppy did after we put it on her.... she has only barked maybe 3-4 times in the 5 days she's been wearing it.... and those will be short once-only barks instead of the constant irritating barking she'd normally do the minute we took her outside.... she even barks less inside when the collar is not on......... it has made our life much calmer and more pleasant and no more nasty notes on my door from my neighbors... worth every dime i spent for it!
2,Not the best,"I had another upgraded bark collar by the same company which was more expensive. When I lost it, I replaced it with this one. I don't like it because you cannot control the degree of the shock. The other one I could put it on high when I was in situations where I knew my dog would bark and my dog would stop immediately. This one takes a longer time and the dog can be almost in a barking frenzy before it begins to go off and then it really shocks him.The more expensive one is much better."
1,Horrible collar,There are better options out there. This doesn't allow a control for intensity. That is a fundamental flaw with the product and why I don't recommend.
1,NOT safe...,"I put the collar on my beagle this weekend to help with nuisance barking. I thought it would be okay to give her a little shock when she barked. The first time she wore it it was just for a few minutes, and she barked twice and then we took it off. The second time I went to the bathroom and she started barking, and it shocked her and then she yelped, then it shocked her again, and yelped, etc. It was SO STRONG that she started spewing vomit, and was very panicked. I tried to calm her down, but I couldn't because she kept yelping. The only way to get the product to stop was to get it off of her, so I had to get her to stand near me for long enough to undo the buckle, which was very hard to do. It would have been nice if there was a remote included as well for situations like this when you just need it to shut off. I will never use this product again and am returning it as I do not feel it is safe to use."
2,Doesn't work on long haired dog,"Literature indicates hair on neck may need to be shaved. I'm not interested in shaving a beautiful dog, especially because one shouldn't leave this collar on 24/7. It doesn't work on the dog without shaving."
2,Not for small dogs,"We purchased these for our two poodles. They are about 10lbs. The dogs had such a horrible reaction to the pain caused by the shock that we couldn't use them. I'm sure that for bigger, sturdier dogs they work great."
2,No Luck,Bought two for our small dogs. Followed all the instructions (except for shaving the dog's neck) and product did not work for us. We do have friends that bought this and it works well.
1,Inhumane,"This causes seizures in dogs and is torturous for the animal...Some people would do anything for money and I am shocked at Amazon for even considering selling this product...if your dog is happy and content, it will not bark, so it must be something you are doing wrong, dog owners and manufacturers of this garbage...I shall write Amazon about this product but stop selling it NOW...!!!...I have also contacted the ASPCA...for their reaction..."
3,NOT supersonic or inaudible,"Product says that the beep is inaudible to human ears. Wrong. The dog barks - then the little black box beeps. I doubt there is another ""supersonic"" emmission that only the dog can hear.But does it work anyway? not sure yet. I put it on my dog a couple days ago. She still barks at the door when someone comes. Maybe she will stop in a few more days or weeks."
3,Product quality going down hill,"I had used one of these very same bark collars on my dog 10 years ago and it was heaven, I swore by it then. When we got a new puppy recently, I relied on the same collar I had success with previously. I was only pleasantly surprised for a few days this time instead of months. I had read the comments regarding the battery life and since I had success in the past thought perhaps these individuals received less than par collars and prayed I would not. Well, the barking stopped for a few days. perhaps two or three and the battery went dead. I agree with the relief they bring and also as a business major, agree with the poor quality of the battery being a misguided incentive to keep purchasing from the company. However, what I would recommend the company hear is the complaints of the battery and perhaps the ripples these complaints may put into the brand recognition, reputation and strength. Hint for your strongest competitor... it may be their way to your market share."
1,no bark collar made by pet safe,I purchased this product from Amazon.com as I have a dog that barks in the car. This collar was defective and it did not work at all. I had to call the company and they were gracious enough to send me a replacement collar. I will not recommend purchasing no bark collars from Amazon.com as there is no way of knowing if the product works.
2,It works!.... but with HORRIBLE battery life,"To be honest, this thing does in fact work great. However, a battery a day is just ridicules. I bought this collar for my puppy because he barked non-stop any time he was left alone. He would seriously bark for hours on end. This collar (along with 6 consecutive batteries/days of use) put a quick stop to that before it became a habit. I am just reluctant to buy more batteries for it because the last battery I had was installed but the collar never even went on the puppy and the next day the battery was blinking indicating it was almost dead after sitting idle! For only a day!As far as I'm concerned, it served it's one week purpose and now it is just battery parasite that sits in my junk drawer."
1,Battery Dead,I really don't know how it works. The battery was dead when I received it and since it is a special battery I have to order another one.I have 3 of the pet safe collars now and so far none have them have worked. I won't be buying any more. I am using a water spray bottle when he barks and saving myself the money.
1,CRAP,DO NOT BUY THIS COLLAR FOR DOGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT DOES NOT WORK AT-ALL!!!! THE PRONGS NEVER PICK UP THE VIBRATION FROM YOUR DOGS NO MATTER HOW TIGHT YOU MAKE IT. AND THE PRONGS ARE AT LEAST AN INCH TO TWO INCHES LONG WHICH POKES INTO THERE NECK. IT SHOCKED MY CONSTANT BARKING WEENIE DOG ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN. I KNEW I WAS SENDING IT BACK TWO MINUTES AFTER I PUT IT ON HER! I GUESS THE ONLY ++ IS I GOT MY MONEY BACK...A MONTH LATER!!!!
2,"No good for double-coated breeds -- eg, Keeshond or Samoyed","I had high hopes for this, as my keeshond is extremely vocal, but was simply unable to get it to deliver any kind of shock at all through his hair. He does have a particularly thick coat, but I tried parting it under the unit, and pulling the collar very very tight, but still nothing. Just in case it was the dog and not the hair, I tried it on a Samoyed, with much less of a ruff, but it didn't work on her either. I called the company, and they suggested shaving his neck, but I don't think they appreciated just what this would mean. Anyway, if anyone can recommend any way of keeping a keeshond quiet, please let me know."
1,didn't work for us,"a waste of money for us. this collar did not deter our dog from barking. adjusted and followed directions, but no success."
5,Fantastic Product,"I had 3 dogs that barked constantly at everything. I tried the sonic collars, the citronella collars, and all sorts of training to no avail. 24 hours after putting these collars on them, their barking is reduced 99%. Only 1 still barks, and that is only occasionally, and usually only a single bark, but he is ultra stubborn. This product changed my relationship with my pets to a much more positive one. I can leave them outside without supervision because they aren't going to go ballistic at everything that moves as before."
1,Piece of Junk!,"DO NOT BUY!!!! Complete waste of money. Bought it, did everything the instructions said to do....and nothing. The collar was tight, I shaved the area, I tested it, and my dog still barks. I even put it on myself and after maybe 50 barks it worked once."
1,Don't waste your money,"Worst dog product we've tried in a long time. Not only was it ineffective on our dog but the battery (that came with the product) fell apart when my husband changed the battery. In addition, the batteries wear out really quickly. My advice, don't waste your money"
4,"PetSafe No-Bark Collar, PBC-102",The only problem I have had with the collars is for them to stay in place without being so tight they are choking the dog. Often I find the black box to the side of the neck and have to constantly move it back around to its proper place. The collar has done what it is suppose to and after just a few times the dogs caught on real quick not to bark. We bring the collar back out when they have to be reminded.
2,Must be EXTREMELY tight to work,"When it works, it works great. But unfortunately, it has to fit so perfectly on my dog's neck to work that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. This results in my dog taking the chance and barking anyway. In order for it to work it has to be so tight on her throat that the prongs are jabbed into her neck, so I would NEVER recommend leaving your dog unsupervised with it on! It also must be exactly in the right spot on her throat - which I have yet to figure out where the magic spot is. I would not buy this collar again - way too unreliable!"
4,Sheltie-need I say more?,"Adopted a sheltie from rescue and she came with all of the requisite sheltie behaviors including incessant barking. We were able to redirect her misbehaviors save the barking--particularly at woodland critters (squirrels and deer) and passing cars (not fun when you are driving down main street). So faced with potentially unhappy neighbors, we decided to try the shock collar. One beep and zap and it was over. The shock did frighten her, but she immediately associated the zap with the bark. She still runs like a nut along the fence line, but she does it quietly. Same with riding in the car. Very pleased with the results. Why did the collar lose a star? Came with a dead battery and must replace the battery with a proprietary one. Meant a 25 minute drive to another town to purchase it. I cannot promise the collar will work for every dog, but if you are faced with bark softening or surrendering your pet, give it a try."
4,v enjoyable Saxophone heaven !,"I've had this one a while ; some of Hemphills finest post WSQ work, a master composer/arranger shows both the raw fervour and sophistication in his work. some of his great tunes like ""Otis groove"", ""Flooppy"" , ""Fat man"", ""Anchor"", Hard Blues"" Hemphills arrangements enlarge these basic melodies bring out both the elemental and complex, the black american church, gospel, earthy blues, collective improv and textures of free jazz, the harmonic richness of an Ellingtonian sax section, I love the way the soloists and ensemble switch lead and support roles , improv and written music blending seamlessly. No other reviews ? no one else knows this music, what a shame , these Hemphill was a contemporary master definitely derserve a greater audience, this music is still creative + rewarding. An excellent disc worth many repeated listenings."
3,How to use wild edibles but not how to identify them.,"Overall rating: 3 starsPlant identification: 2 starsPlant uses: 4 starsPicture type(s): black & white drawingsWho will find it useful: experienced foragers who can already identify plants but want more ways to prepare, ferment, or smoke them. It is also a good inspiration for those just starting to forage.Notes: Euell Gibbons is considered the grandfather of modern foraging. While this book isn't much help in identifying wild edible plants it shines in how to prepare them for eating, drinking (tea, coffee, fermented), or smoking them. His prose reads almost like poetry and I can't read more than a few pages before he's inspired me to dash off into the woods to gather something for supper."
5,Stalking the Wild Asparagus,"I have known this book for over 20 years. I has been almost a bible for my foraging. I used to borrow it from the library several times a year. Then the county libraby removed it from the shelf to make room for newer books. I was very dissappointed. I had to borrow the book from a library 2 counties away. I was delighted to discover that Amazon carried Stalking the Wild Asparagus. The book is a wonderful reference tool, personable, acurate, and has detailed illustrations."
3,not exactly what I expected....,"This book is not exactly what I was expecting. Which is kind of unfair on my part since it is exactly what it claimed to be, it was just nothing more. WHAT IT IS LACKING: good pictures of the plants, info on what areas of the country plants grow in, and DETAILED info on how to find them. If you are looking for a quick synopsis of how to find wild vegetation with a long winded personal story from the author then this is a perfect book for you. I, personally, wish I would have just looked up the few wild plants I was looking for online. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice book...just really not what I was looking for."
2,Lacking pictures,"There are no pictures just black and white drawings of the plants and not all of the plants even have drawings. The book is only useful for plants that I already know what they are. Some of the plants that I knew what they are, apparently are edible so that was interesting."
1,Non playable,"This cd shows as non-playable on both my cd players.When I try to visit the return center online, it will not let me list the reason for return, or continue.I've ordered quite a few cd's from Amazon, but unless this is resolved, I'll never order another one.Sure glad I didn't order it to give to someone else."
5,Christmas in the Caribbean is FANTASTIC!,Got this CD for a Caribbean themed Christmas party that I hosted! It was GREAT! It really gives you the feel of being in the Caribbean and all of your favorite Christmas songs! We even did the limbo to a few of them! If you want a true taste of the Caribbean at Christmas... this is the CD for you!
4,Just what I wanted,"A great addition to our Christmas music collection. I have tried for some time to find a good quality album of steel drum Christmas music and finally did, thanks."
3,Oilcloth,"I remember my mom having oilcloth and was so pleased to find it at Amazon.It's just like I remembered. Very good quality,and so easy to clean."
5,Richard Simmons makes the best exercise DVDs,"I have to exercise for arthritis and good health. These DVDs make exercise fun. I just pretend my husband is taking me dancing and we put on Richard. I used to exercise to someone else's DVD, and she just had some towels and a few plants in the background. Richard is into the big show. In Sweatin' 4, my favorite one, he has a big stage, a gospel choir, fancy schmancy lighting and scenery with musical notes and lights, and a band. He pairs the exercise with music and other stuff that people really like. He is a real behavior modification genius the way he has gotten so many people to buy his DVDs and exercise. I really like the people in his DVDs as well. They are all ages, shapes, and sizes- and they are great enthusiastic and talented dancers. You get all of the Sweatin DVDs in this package, so if you get bored with one, you can use another one. The music is really good!!"
5,Much better than the older ones,"I bought this DVD because I'm disabled due to a back condition. I get very little exercise so I really needed something that was low impact, yet would get my heart rate up a little. I was very impressed with it. It's not too hard (I couldn't do his older ones now) yet it works up a sweat and gets the heart rate going. With my condition, I'm not able to do it everyday but it's still something I can do. It's not too long, keeps you moving and has a great cool down session. If you want a hard workout with lots of talking that takes at least an hour, then this isn't for you. If you need to warm up, do a low impact workout, cool down and not spend a huge amount of time on the workout, then this is perfect. There isn't a lot of bending, which I can't do. Even though I can't do it everyday, it is the only work out that I have found that I can do at all. It's also fun!"
5,GRANDMA SWEATING WITH THE OLDIES,"AND BELIEVE ME ITS ABOUT TO KILL ME. BUT! I LOVE IT. I ONLY WORKED OUT 5 MIN. THE FIRST TIME. AND RICHARD SIMMONS SAID ""THAT WAS OUR WARM UP, NOW LETS GET STARTED""......WHEWWW WEE, I HAD THE TAPE BUT, REALLY WANTED THE DVD, SO I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT. AND I AM WORKING OUT WITH IT. I FEEL BETTER THEN I HAVE IN A LONG TIME. I DON'T DO THE FULL WORKOUT...BUT! I DO WORKOUT UNTIL I START BREATHING HARD,THEN I WORK 5 MORE MIN. AND QUIT. IT IS A GREAT DVD AND I PLAN ON GETTING MORE FOR SOME OF MY FRIENDS.."
4,Fun way to break it up....,"I used to do these with my mom when I was a teenager and they are just as fun as I remember. For those of you hoping for an intense workout this is not for you, however for everyone else I think you'll enjoy it. The steps are easy to follow and it does get you sweating. I love this for my light workout days. My only real complaint is sometimes the camera zooms in on one of the back up people when Richard is changing steps and you don't get a clear idea of what he's doing. Mr. Simmons can be a bit annoying at first, but it's easy to put that aside as you get into it. All in all it's a fun workout and gets you moving."
2,Disappointed with Sweatin' to the Oldies,"Sadly, this didn't do it for me. I found the video quality to be poor (like a 2nd or 3rd generation of an old VCR tape) and the actual exercise moves jerky and hard to follow. I was really looking forward to enjoying moving and exercising to these great old tunes but just found myself frustrated."
3,Present for Mom,Mom loves it and thats all that matters. Exactly what she wanted and reminds me of the exercise days in the 90's!
5,Great workout,I had these in the old VHS and was thrilled when they came out in DVD. They're corny but a great workout!
4,Great cardiovascular work-out,Great dvd's so far. Haven't viewed them all yet. Think it could really work if I can stick to it.The good selection of rock oldies make it fun.
4,Speedy service appreciated,Thanks for the speedy service. The DVD is as promised but now I have to use it. Thanks again.
3,"Okay, but needs updating","I bought this DVD to replace the days that I do not get to the gym. I am in my mid 20s and enjoy the music on the DVD. I think the music is great but I wish they would update the people and background. You can clearly tell that this was made back in the 80s. Though I enjoy the older music I would like to see people in newer aged clothing, newer aged backgrounds, and newer aged hair styles. This is just my personal opinion. I do sweat when using this DVD. However, I add in some extra moving around to make sure that I am sweating enough. Overall the songs are great and so is Richard, but the clothing, background, and hair styles could use some updating."
1,Sweatin,"I was quite disappointed in this dvd, I thought it would be more exercising than dance, but it was the other way around. It's good if you're into the dancing part of it though."
3,SWEATING TO THE OLDIES,"TOO MUCH REPETITION. TOO MUCH TALKING. TOO MUCH WAITING TIME TILLYOU GET TO THE EXERCISE. NOT BAD IF YOU GET ONE, BUT THE SET MAKES NO SENSE."
3,Disappointed,"In my choice and the packaging. This is not the DVD I thought I was ordering. I have a VCR version with the same title and songs, but set in a diner, using props such as a chair and soda bottles. I did the 'Diner' workout back in the 90's with my kids when they were young and we had a blast doing it. While it is still a good workout, it isn't what I expected. Does anyone know the DVD I am talking about? Do I have the name wrong?The packaging is pitiful. For the amount of money it cost, it would have been nice to have a real case for storage. The pressed paper case offers little to no protection for the DVD."
5,Love it!,"I used to have 1 & 2 on VHS but now I don't have a VHS player. When I found the series on DVD I was so excited!!! I really love Richard and enjoy doing his program, it's easy yet hard enough to make a difference. Plus the music is great---takes you back to a better time."
2,Sweatin to the Oldies,"The ""exercise part"" was great, but I REALLY do not like all the talking Richard does at the beginning and end of each dvd. He talks too much and it takes too long to fast forward each time to get to the exercise. I would not recommend it for this reason.Hippity Hop"
5,Great workouts,"I hate working out, but I seem to have better luck sticking to it with Richard. Fun music and heart-pumping action."
5,Richard Simmons just never gets tired of SWEATING TO THE OLDIES!!!!,"I began to work out with Richard Simmons in my thirties and now again in my 50's. He is amazing, encouraging and true to his calling. His workouts are simple and easy to understand and 1 and 2 are perfect for beginners! If you are more advanced you may want to step it up a notch with Sweatin 3 and four. Thanks Richard for teaching me how to GET MOVIN and thanks for the results! I have had great success"
3,Wrong DVD lenght!,"Got the DVD based on the running time of 90 minutes. It actually is the first volume of the series and is only about 30 minutes long and just 10 songs. I like the sweatin' series as an alternative to a 'real' exercise since its a lot of fun but I thought I was getting a longer workout. (Ironically, I gave away the first volume of the series because it was too short! Ah, well.....)"
3,Difficult to keep up with the Workouts,"Richard Simmons' entire collection is great. My problem is that I enjoy watching it more than I enjoy participating. I thought it would be a simpler exercise program, targeting obese people, but I found it too complex to even keep up. Way too many moves and changes in each segment. I never did catch on. I'm 36 yrs old and have already lost weight. I bought this collection because I thought it would be an easy way to maintain my weight loss, but it didn't turn out that way."
4,hum - need to take off my desk and put in the player,It's not working for me right now. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new.
5,MEMORIES,This is a fantastic way to work out. Im starting out with the first 5 dances Number six song was wipe out and I not ready for that yet (ha ha}I highly recomend this. Will also bring back the old good memories
5,Fun Set,"OK, so you think Richard Simmons is annoying. Well, he may be annoying, but this set has a lot of good tunes for those of us who cannot refer to ourselves as young anymore, and this makes it a fun set to use."
5,Fun! Fun! Fitness,"This is great for beginner fitness gurus. I have always found Richard Simmons to be a little kooky, but lots of fun. He knows what it is to be heavy, and has empathy for folks. The songs are fun, and he doesn't make it difficult to get going. You don't have to dress a particular way, just wear good sneakers. I am having a blast doing the dances and singing along. It doesn't even feel like exercise, it's dancing, and getting the old heart beating. Go Richard!"
5,"it is more fun, than what is out there at the gyms!","I have tried so many workouts at local gyms.. I have not seen the results, that I have seen with Richard Simmons 's workout. He may look out of date, but the workout is FUN, real fun.. You dance to your level of sweating... You WILL lose weight, and actually enjoy dancing. I think the new workouts, should turn the clock back, and start having dance again. They tried it with zumba, but they failed. Everyone loves rock and roll, any age.. lets rock the weight off.."
2,Not Impressed AT ALL!!,I purchased this because I am an exercise beginner. I would not suggest this to anyone.Thanks
1,just what I was looking for,I would rather exercise in my home and wanted some sort of dancing. To me it is more fun than just regular exercises. It is perfect.
1,Did not recieve item - waited over a month - ask for refund,"One of the individuals selling this product failed to fullfill their agreement as a seller. I waited over a month for the items.....after I had already been charged. I e-mailed the individual twice with no repsond. I reported this to Amazon which is in the process of refunding my money.Don't buy anything from ddmays!!!!!!Thanks,Gail"
5,Richard Simmons Sweatin To the Oldies,"Great workout with some good oldies. the series takes one from beginner to really workin you out.Fast service, brand new product, Highly recommend it."
3,I appreciate Richard's enthusiasm,"I know Richard Simmons is a workout guru. I love to exercise at home with DVDs. I bought this set of Sweatin' to the Oldies thinking it would be a fun set of aerobics videos. But I had a hard time following a lot of his moves. He does not give any cues as to what the moves are. The workouts are kind of fun and infectious, but I found myself making up my own moves frequently."
5,Sweatin to the AWESOME!,"Great product, good motivational encouragement from Richard and the ability to grow in intensity with the workouts. So glad to be able to mix up the songs with the different Vids.Enjoy:)"
4,"Finally, an exercise video I'll actually do!",This is the ONLY exercise video that I've used (and I've used plenty) that I still use on a regular basis. Richard Simmons makes aerobics fun! Thank you Mr. Simmons!
5,Richard Simmons Workout DVD collection,This DVD collection is great. I just started to workout at home and this collection is a great way to get in your daily excercise.
4,Fun and moderate,I bought this DVD set to get me interested in exercise again and it worked! They are so much fun to do when your regular routine is boring you. I walk on the treadmill most days but when I want to take it a little easier but still do my exercise and these DVDs are a genuine workout. I like Sweatin' 3 the best and don't care for Sweatin' 2 as much but with this set you can pick your own favorite. I also enjoy watching Richard in action; he makes me laugh and the bonus self esteem dvd is well thought out and effective. I defineltly suggest it for anyone who wants to work out with their kids or just wants to do a low impact routine that doesn't leave you in pain.
5,sweating can be fun!,"I'm in my 60's and walking the dog wasn't giving me the exercise I needed to stay in shape. Having avoided exercise all my life, I decided to try these tapes and guess what...they are so fun you forget it's really exercise until you realize you have really worked up a sweat! Amazing! Sure, Richard Simmons is a little over the top but it's fun anyway. I recommend the whole set to anyone who hates to exercise but loves to dance to the Oldies. Richard has a group of people with him, some are very overweight. They are a real inspiration...if they can keep up, so can I. And, surprise, surprise...I've been losing those excess pounds even while indulging in Holiday treats!!Also, got these tapes at a great price with fast delivery - Thanks Amazon!!"
3,The Complete Collection of Sweatin to the Oldies,"This is a good set if you can get past the 80s clothes, hair, and corny scenes. Also, I think this set would be ideal for someone who has a lot of weight to lose and has not worked out in a long time. I am in pretty good shape currently and not overweight, but was looking to change up my routine with the Denise Austin DVDs I normally work out to. The warm-ups on these are way too long, but again, would be good for someone who hasn't worked out in awhile. Once you've done the warm-up, the exercises really do get you ""sweatin."" The music is great and Richard's energy is fantastic. I'll continue to work out to these once in awhile when I need a change. Sweatin' 2 is the best DVD in this set workout-wise if you are already in shape."
4,Fun and Memory Provoking!,Sweatin' to the OldiesI have enjoyed this DVD as it is simple but surprisingly good exercise. I am not the most gracefull dancer but in the privacy of my own home I don't care. I really enjoy exercise with this DVD. Richard's excitement and enthusiasm is contagious. Newfmom
2,Not one I use very much,"If I feel like taking it easy I'll put in this DVD, otherwise, the routines are pretty lame-o. But great if you're more than 50 lbs. overweight since it's low impact. Simmons is self-indulgent and seems to be doing the steps as they come to him. We're not given any warning or heads up when he suddenly goes into the next bit. The live band is a distraction (as good as they are) because Simmons bounces and squeals like a school girl after every song. I just want a challenging, no-nonsense workout, please. If you're a Richard Simmons uber fan, then this one's for you! If not, I would try Hip Hop Abs by Beachbody. Now THAT's a fun energetic workout with a host who's engaging, fun, instructive and...of course, great to look at."
4,collection of sweatin to the oldies,"there are a few places on 2 of the videos that the quality of the picture is fuzzy, otherwise pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this purchase to others."
5,Love It!,"My Mom had the first video on vhs years ago. I loved working out to it then and I still love it today! I only remembered the first one, so that one was easy to workout to. The rest took a little time to get the exercises down. But it was defintely worth it. My 2- and 3- year olds even try to do them with me. I definitely recommend these."
4,Sweatin' to the Oldies,I hate to exercise but love to dance. Being older - the music was just my style.Dee
5,Nicest Guy On The Planet!,I bought this set in the UK and am thoroughly enjoying sweating to the first one. He is somwacky and so much fun. Have watched the others through but not attempted them yet. I went onto Richard's Facebook page and messaged him about my purchase. Within a few hours this wonderful man emailed me back with a really encouraging personal message. I will think about that kindness and smile very time I play one of these workouts. A truly dedicated man who I now know actually cares about me! I recommend these workouts which will inspire you to look after yourself because you are worth it.
5,update your VCR library,years ago we had a Sweatin to the Oldies tape and my husband used to laugh at me dancing to it...now that we're senior citizens he decided it would be a fun work out and saw the ad on TV for all of the sessions--loved the price and the quick delivery!
5,Sweating to the Oldies,DVDs arrived in perfect condition. This is a FUN workout and really does make you sweat
4,Love the Oldies,"If one likes to dance (which I do) and is a Baby Boomer, these CD's are a fun workout. Exercise and have fun with it. I find myself going on my own with the dancing to the music but the most important thing is I am getting exercise and getting my heart rate up. It is great if you cannot do high impact exercising for health reasons."
4,I am pleased!,Product came on time and in condition expected. I feel I got a good buy. Kids and I have fun doing the exercises.
5,Richard Simmons workout,Working out can be very boring! Richard makes it so much fun. I din't even realize I had been working out for an hour! What FUN!!!
4,A Blast from the Past,"I did some of these exercise routines many years ago when they first came out, and they are a lot of fun, plus without killing myself I manage to get some moderate physical activity. Richard Simmons is great in Swaetin' to the Oldies."
3,Sweatin' to the Oldies,It arrived fairly quick and I enjoy dancing to the music. I can work up a sweat which is what I was looking for. I would rather they would have added more songs to dance to instead of showcasing each person who appeared on the DVD and how much weight they lost. It would get less boring if they had two 30 minute dance workouts to switch between!
3,Think twice if you have carpeting (and don't learn dance moves quickly),"I bought this because I thought it would be fun, as well as a good workout. But, the workouts are loaded with way too many dance moves which are difficult (for me, at least) to learn without repeating them over and over again. Plus, unless you're lucky enough to work out on hardwood or tile floors, the pivots and moves are almost impossible.I bought the Biggest Loser Cardio Max workout, which was a much better choice for me."
4,A good workout,"Although watching these videos feels like I stepped onto a Ferris Bueller film, the workouts are fast paced. The people who exercise with Richard are folks who are intent on changing their lives, are in all shapes and sizes and do not have plastic, perfect bodies...you know the type you see in most exercise videos.I have taken Jazzercise classes over the years and Richard Simmons videos are on a even par and in some cases tougher than those classes.Well worth the money!"
3,Fun to use but does get repetitive,THis is a fun wat to get moving everyday. The songs and Richard can get old but it is still a great workout for any level of beginner. My son who is 7 loves doing these with me too. As someone with a chronic illness I found this to be a workable exercise program.
4,Fun,I've only done the first one so far but it seems to be a fairly simple workout that anyone can probably do. I have lower back problems and some of the movements seem to agravate it but if I'm careful and don't overdo it I'm fine. I really like that there are people of all sizes on the video doing the routine.
4,"Richard Simmons ""The Complete Collection of Sweatin' to the Oldies""","I have been using ""Sweatin' to the Oldies I"" for years to get my students moving and exercising. Whether you like Richard Simmon's or not, you will enjoy these workouts. I bought the complete collection so that we could have some variety in our workouts. The kids have a great time and so do I because I exercise right along with them. Because of the music and the dance-like moves, the time goes by quickly and yet when you are done, you are sweating and know you have done aerobics. There are also strength and flexibility exercises that are fun and effective. You should try them out for sure!"
3,untitled,"This a very useable book. unfortunately, not what I was looking for. Don't get me wrong here, it's a very well done book. And I've already learned something from it.I will purchase what I need at a later date.Thanks, DKK"
2,nothing special,"This collections starts off with a great line: ""The sea comes in like nothing but the sea"" and the poem that follows is an ok poem. The problem is that that ok poem is the best poem in the book. And it is a problem when an ""ok poem"" is the best poem you've got. Now, don't get me wrong, Maxwell can write a good poem. I've heard him read from his next collection, and it is some good work. But the poems in _The Nerve_ are weak and not very spectacular. They are too quiet for lack of a better word. Maxwell can do better than this. Let's just hope he does."
4,Believe the Hype Comrade!,"I'm actually shocked. I kind of imagined that I would enjoy this film, at least a little, but it turned out to be, easily, one of the top five movies of the year.An excellent crime film that could easily become ""The Godfather"" of Russian mob movies. A superb cast, brilliant script, and a director who seems to be getting better with age. These are truly memorable characters.Who thought he could only go up after ""The Fly""?.......Definately worth a rental, but not for the weak at heart."
3,Eastern Promises,I liked this movie but... I thought it was very interesting and action movie. when the movie ended I looked at my kids and said. Is that it? I don't recomend it for children under 13. it's mostly for adults. There's nudity and violence. Some secenes toward the end it made my oldest son turn his head.And he's 22.
3,hard to follow,"I had a hard time understanding Eastern Promises. If it wasn't the quiet mumbling that dominated the majority of the conversations, it was the shocking and disgusting segments involving gruesome deaths, blood, or other kinds of violence. The build up in the beginning was extremely slow and uninteresting. It's not a movie for everyone."
4,Not quite what I expected...,"...but very good. Good acting and a good plot, though I felt Naomi Watts was understated and under used. The feel of the movie is not overly dark as it may seem, but there definitely is a fair share of gore. It is also definitely not a movie for younger viewers. My greatest complaint would be it felt the movie ended with only two thirds of the story told, but that does not take away from the quality of the movie itself. Recommended."
4,Russian Mafia,"An in depth intense look at the Russian Mafia. If you enjoy intense dramas like ""The Departed"" or ""Donnie Brasco"", you will probably enjoy this one. Several excellent performances. Viggo Mortensen is great as a driver for the mob that has a sketchy past. Although there is some bloody hardnosed intense moments it will still appeal to most members that enjoyed ""The Godfather"", which was not exactly truly family friendly either. The trailer gives a fairly accurate idea of what the movie is about. A mafia member rises in the ranks by killing people but may not be what he appears to be. Overall a great story, directing, acting, and music. Although I typically don't recommend buying dramas this intense, this is one of those that stand out like ""Taxi Driver"", and are a must have. Good DVD with good replayability."
4,Eastern Promises,"Eastern Promises is a very good film, I think cronenberg finally did a good job with a film for once,with the exception of the male nudity fight scene I enjoyed the movie and it's portrayal of Organized Crime.It has great acting and moments.It's worth watching."
5,Well Worth Your Time,"A taut, intelligent and well-acted thriller all about identity and how far you're willing to go. Very well shot and directed with no padding, and action sequences that actually serve the plot instead of the other way around. Wonderful casting, and Armin Mueller-Stahl especially is simply fantastic as a far too helpful restaurant owner."
3,"dark movie, darker viggo","You've seen the description of this movie, so I'll skip that. It's dark, violent, slow-moving at times, and very predictable until the end of the movie where you're rewarding with a slight twist in the story. Gritty, gruesome, and ALOT of Russian language lessons. If you like mobster movies, this one might be for you. If not, pass..."
4,Not great but interesting,"Viggo has some very interesting roles. In many ways, EP reminded me of ""A History of Violence"" with a touch of ""The Godfather."" The plot took some strange turns and it ends kind of abruptly (but at least it avoided the typical clichés). EP isn't a great movie but I thought it was very interesting on a more subtle level. There's a twist, of course (but I won't spoil it) but then there's a twist to the twist as well. I really liked it.Recommended"
3,Made Worth It by Nude Knife Fight,"Expected a bit more from this film, despite its having Naomi Watts in it. But I would say it was worth it if only for Viggo Mortenson's nude knife fight in the Turkish bath. Wholly original, that one. The villainry were largely cliches."
5,Vory v zakone,"Vory v zakone - Thieves in law.This movie left me very pleased, the script is very good, nothing is over explained but every thing connects. There is a constant threat of menace all through the movie and the portrait of the Russian mafia is dark and sinister, not the men to be trifled with, in fact stay away.So it is no place for a warm hearted midwife looking for the origins of a new born baby. Her investigations take her face to face with the inner circle of the mafia, a place no one should go. Drugs, assassinations, human trafficking, prostitution - it is a dark world that shuns the light and attention.With strong preformances by Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel it is the script that shines through. The directing is good and when there is violence it is no holds barred and all the time the potential for more is just below the surface.It is a good and believable film. Highly recommended."
4,A gaping hole,"At the end of this fascinating story, just before the finish, there is a huge jump in the story. The character jumps from B to E. You wonder how did he get here? If only the director had shared with us some of the detail. It's as if we flipped to the last page of the book. It's good, but could have been better."
4,One of this years best.,"Cronenberg follows up his stray away from horror film A History of Violence with this great film. Vigo is great and will most definitely be nominated for an Oscar. The film appears so simple on the outside but the depth is immeasurable. The mob + everyday families really gives the film a great boost. It is my second favorite film of the year behind No Country For Old Men. But that may change after I see Sweeney Todd tonight. This is one of Cronenberg's best along with Dead Ringers, Videodrome, Existenz, and A History A Violence. A must see for anyone!"
2,Jason Statham movie,"This movie was okay. Viggo Mortensen was fantastic as usual, but mis-/under-utilized. Without his performance, this would essentially have been a ""Jason Statham"" action movie. There were a number of cringe-worthy dialogue moments, as well as general heavy-handedness; the music in scenes telling you ""this is an important scene,"" for example. This was a decidedly NOT deep movie, which was too bad since it seemed to think it was. History of Violence was a much much better movie, though it seems not so much due to Cronenberg. This one reminds me of the final showdown scene in HOV (the worst, most dumb action movie part of the movie - ""brohim"" indeed!) but for a whole film. I enjoy good action scenes, and there were one or two in this one, but that is about all there was to it. It was mercifully short."
4,Good movie,"This is a good movie to watch. I watched it a second time and caught some things I missed watching it the first time and made more sense. It's not a hard movie to follow. There is action, plot and good chemistry with the actors/actresses. Worth watching on a day when you're not interupted."
4,"Viggo is, again, a good ""bad guy"".","We watched this on PPV one night when the kids weren't around. It had us guessing until the end, which these days is a real treat. My wife REALLY likes Viggo and I must admit he is in very good shape for his age and an excellent actor, so we would see anything that he is in. He is very much like Kirk Douglas in his prime, but better. I am not into blood and gore, but they did a really good job with this one -- usually there is way too much for one person to spill and be alive. The scene in the bath house is really good -- don't blink! We may even get the DVD!"
2,"""Eastern Promises"" Doesn't Quite Deliver!!","Alright, I originally saw the previews for this movie while watching another movie in the theater.... ""Eastern Promises"" plot/storyline sounded intriguing to say the least.I recently saw this movie on dvd rental and it was awful!! It is slow, incredibly, heart-wrenchingly slooooow to watch!! Several times I wanted to stop this movie and just return it. I kept watching ""Eastern Promises"" as I figured it must have a good ending but it didn't. There were lots of loose ends that weren't adequately answered at the end of the movie. Lots of themes/topics were superficially touched upon, but never quite explored in the kind of detail that could have made this a movie an all around great one.Naomi Watts & Viggo Mortensen were the only shining stars in this movie as their acting was the best part of the entire film."
2,"GREAT CAST & PERFORMANCES, BUT SERIOUSLY FLAWED!","This film while having a good story and cast is really hard to follow. The thick accent and mumbling of characters had me straining and backing my TiVo up too many times! I also felt that some scenes were excruciatingly long and slow! I almost wanted to fast forward, which is never a good sign. This has got to be one of Cronenberg's worst films! Some viewers may like it more than I did, I will never sit through this a second time."
2,"Not as suspenseful and thrilling as ""A History of Violence""","This movie is not as suspenseful and thrilling as ""A History of Violence"". Viggo Mortensen's acting is good but he can't save the film. It's worth seeing for curiosity."
1,Ridiculously implausible script,"Apart from Viggo Mortensen, this movie is a waste of time. If they had acted it just a bit more over the top, it would have been a fine dark comedy. As it is, it's just dull and unrealistic. The violence is graphic and lurid, but doesn't add much to theme or plot. I felt it was gratuitous. If you want to see a much better movie about Russian mob life, try either ""Brat"" (Brother), ""Brat II"", or ""Friend of the Deceased"" (Ukrainian film). These three films have a lot more to say about life in the criminal trades, and just being human, than ""Eastern Promises"". Most of the plot line is just totally unrealistic."
5,Viggo Yum yum,I rented Eastern Promises because the story was the first I had seen about the Russian Mafia and it had Viggo Mortenson as the star. The plot involves the death of an abused Russian minor who gives birth to a baby girl. The doctor who helps her finds her diary and asks her Russian uncle to translate it English. The uncle is alarmed when he realizes what happened to the girl is related to the Vor the Russian Mafia. There is a fight scene in a bath house when Viggo is setup and blamed for murder he did not commit. He wins a fight against two assassins naked and unarmed it. was a fantastic scene worth renting the movie for that alone. Viggo is an Russian undercover cop who needs to take down the head of the group and take his place. The writing of the female doctors character has her stupidly challenging men who would have killed her without a second thought. Good thing Viggo liked her.
3,Disappointing Cronenberg entry...,"Even though the acting is - for the most part - quite good and the film features an incredibly brutal and balls-out (cue rimshot) fight that's one of the most unusual in film history, EASTERN PROMISES kept such a chilly distance between the audience and the protagonists it was hard to relate or enjoy the film.This simply wasn't a patch on A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, although it was wonderful seeing the venerable Armin Mueller-Stahl in such a juicy role.It's a rental, not a permanent member of my DVD collection."
3,Pretty good,I remember seeing a preview of this movie and thinking it was going be awesome. Well the first few minutes we see a brutal murder but dont expect to see this thru out this movie. The problem with the movie is the actors seem very winded in this film. They do some lines then pause (as if they just ran 10 miles) and then say the next line. The movie was slow at times to say the least. Viggo Mortensen looks cool in this movie but the performance falls flat. Its too bad because it probably would have made the movie better. I still enjoyed it but probably but wont call it a must see or a classic.
4,They think it's all over.... it is now!!,"When I first bought this collection, still in the drool mode from Gilles Peterson INC.. I hoped, indeed prayed for more of the same.. The obvious problem with this collective is that it's over all too soon! Now I can can better understand the female psyche since I'm left yearning for more! The man has talent. Of that there is no doubt, but, like streetwave records from the eighties, this type of ensemble seems to have a limited shelf life, whereas INC has remained playable and listenable over many years now. Maybe it needs another CD a al 2 disc set to complete it"
4,"Not his best, but very good!","The David Murray Octet (which at the time consisted of the leader on tenor and bass clarinet, trumpeters Baikida Carroll and Hugh Ragin, trombonist Craig Harris, altoist John Purcell, pianist Steve Colson, bassist Wilbur Morris and drummer Ralph Peterson) plays very well on four of their leaders lengthy originals. Each composition is memorable in its own respect, with very strong themes, typical of David Murray's pieces. The octet features a good combination of adventurous soloing and colorful writing. I highly reccomend it, but try some of David's other stuff first."
5,No Baby should be delivered without it!,"When I was 9 months pregnant, I literally bumped into Mr. Tague at a book signing in Dayton Ohio. I bought this book and read it cover to cover in the mall food court! I was laughing to myself and Im sure I got a few stares. This book was a hilarious look at eveything from Breastfeeding, to Bathing, to the essentials needed. It read like stereo instructions which made it all the more hilarious. Since I have had my hands on this book I have found it's been the PERFECT gift at every baby shower I have gone to.I wonder if Mr. Tague could convince the hospitals to give this out with each new delivery? :-PDONT PASS THIS ONE UP!"
5,Baby: An Owner's Manual,"I laughed so hard. Great read if you can make it through the laughter tears, it's defiantly a book you need to read with someone. My husband and I are truly enjoying it (so are my coworkers!). A coworker gave this book to me in my 7 month of pregnancy and laughter is what I needed. Excellent Book, I am truly grateful to my coworker and the authors."
4,Riotously funny - good for early in pregnancy,"If you worry that you'll hold the baby the wrong way or have trouble changing a diaper, this book will put you at ease through laughter induced by humerous photographs and descriptions of how some of the basic things should and shouldn't be done. For a more comprehensive instruction manual suitable for later in the pregnancy, see ""The Baby Owner's Manual"" by Louis & Joe Borgenicht."
2,Understand this book is just 96 pages,"This book is not all that expensive, but it's very short. I bought my husband this book, ""She's Had a Baby and I'm Having a Meltdown,"" and ""Keeping the Baby Alive till Your Wife Gets Home."" He likes ""Keeping the Baby Alive"" the best, by far."
1,Where is the magnetic cover???!!,"I owned this exact pair of scissors and absolutely loved them. Good quality; and very practical (you can just stick them to the fridge for storing). They finally broke after almost 8 years. I ordered these, believing they would be identical. Big disappointment! According to the description and the photo the cover is magnetic but, beware, it is NOT. Just an ordinary pair of kitchen scissors in a non-magnetic cover. Completely unusable to us. I had to return them.UPDATE: the review is for the scissors by the way, NOT the seller, MV Trading. They have been very responsive handling my return and could not have been more apologetic about the erroneous posting."
3,OK not Great,Bought this pot and another like it several years ago at a great price from Amazon. It is thin walled and nothing to shout about. Did the job .
2,cheap looking ring,"This ring looks like a glass ring, very basic and my normal size did not fit. Order one size up"
1,Cautionary Tale,"The new edition of Aboriginal Woman Sacred and Profane by Phyllis Kaberry, introduced by Sandy Toussaint and published by Routledge in 2003 is not quite the same as the original edition published in 1939.It is stated in the introduction that(1) ""While in accordance with present-day etiquette some of Karbery's commentary has not been reproduced in its original form......""(2) ""Following consultations with senior Aboriginal women, several sections of Karbery's original book have not been reproduced.""I dont know how much has been modified or left out. To see the full work you need to go to the original edition."
4,A very well writen book,"1st Thoughts is a very well writen book of poetry and philosophy, an indepth look at ourselves and how we live life."
4,expensive formula that works,When we discovered our son had food allergies we put him on this formula right away and it worked. His colic symptoms disappeared in 2 weeks and he began to gain wieght. I gave it 4 stars because it is so pricey.
3,Really does stink!,"It's hard to review things like formula since every baby is different and what works for my baby may not work for yours and vice versa.My baby was having a lot of eczema and seborrhea so her doc recommended this formula. After a month I decided to switch it to the regular one because it wasn't helping her skin at all, and it's almost twice as expensive as the regular formula! It stinks really bad, and my baby spit up a LOT on this formula and was extra gassy."
5,This does wonders for reflux -> happy baby,"If you've been struggling to give comfort and nutrition to a baby with serious reflux issues (what many call ""colic"" is in reality, very often just severe reflux) please try this formula. It doesn't smell good, no, but your baby will LOVE it. And there's a great chance you will end up with a happy, relaxed, smiling baby just a few days later. It worked wonders for us."
4,Enchanted garden party,"As Grumbach is planning her 80th birthday party, she reflects on friends both living and dead as well as writers and books and assorted artists that've given her joy over the years. A graceful and sometimes humorous memoir about coming to terms with aging and about how the dead live on in and around the living. Grumbach's style of writing is as crisp as the weather in Maine, and equally embracing."
4,"Great selection, fair sound","My title sums it up. This collection is a nice balance of Top 40, rock radio hits, and album tracks from the Police. My only gripe is the uneven quality of the recordings. Given the available remastering technology I expected a fuller, richer sound. It's okay, ... but that's also it's shortcoming...it's JUST okay."
5,It's simple...,"...the Police were a singles driven band and this distillation of their musical career is almost flawless (we all have favorites that were not included; mine is ""Beds Too Big Without You""). This is pretty near perfect in it's conception because it does cut-out the filler and 'silly songs' that are present on most of their albums. Excellento!"
5,Great Product,I really was impressed with the quality of this product and recomend it highly to others. It exceeded my expectations. This is a great seller!!!
2,Linda,"Unfortunately, two of the six rolling pins broke the first time they were used. The red handles came off. I tried gluing them back on, but that didn't work. I wouldn't purchase this item again."
1,Warning! Chair legs give out!!,My brother bought me this Chair. I just had a painful spinal fusion surgery. One of the castor legs broke when I was sitting at my computer and the chair plumited backward to the ground with me in it. Lucky I was wearing a spinal brace.This chair should be taken off the market. It is dangerous.
4,"Fine Elgar from Hahn, Davis and LSO","I have not yet heard most of the recording, but am truly delighted with what I have heard. Hahn is a brilliant technician who plays the violin with much expressive power. If I had any doubt of this, that was dispelled last night during a riveting performance of this concerto in which she was accompanied by Sir Colin Davis conducting the New York Philharmonic here in New York City. Hers was without question an electrifying performance, which featured vibrant playing of the Third Movement's lengthy cadenza. And much to its credit, the New York Philharmonic's playing was as rhapsodic as the London Symphony's on the Deutsche Grammophon recording. Although I love Hahn's performance of the Elgar violin concerto, I would recommend primarily her performances of the Bach, Beethoven and Brahms violin concerti as her best recorded playing of violin concerti so far."
3,Needs a little....maturing,A very nice rendition...but like a good Bordeaux...she needs a little time to mature as a performer......Met her at Pike's Market in Seattle...where she performedfor the general public.She needs to spend more time...in serious practice...and what a performer she can be....
1,"Good Violin Playing, BAD Elgar","It is difficult for me to write this but all I can say is ""Great violin playing, BAD Elgar."" This is not to say that Hilary Hahn is not a great violinist - she definitely has technique to burn, which is obviously required for performing this piece (particulary the third movement). What's missing in the whole is emotional maturity one hears from Kyung Wha Chung, Ida Haendel and yes, Yehudi Menuhin and Nigel Kennedy's first recording as well as the acceptance that despite words to the contrary, the English are some of the most emotional people on the planet - which explains the rich and overwhelming orchestration of this work, which should always be showcased in ""epic proportions"".No, this is not to say that the Hahn/Davis/LSO effort was wasted, but secret love is not to be kept lightly or, in this case, ""taken lightly""."
1,Hillary is not a true violinist,"seriously people, please LISTEN to this recording and any other hillary's CD's, she is horrible at the violin. as a professional vioinist, I hate to admit that I see a decline in younge violinists and classical music standard. Hillary H, Jousha B, Anne-phie Mutter are not the good, and are far from the earlier violinsts like Szeryng. Young violinists that are truely amazing are Gil Shaham, Vengerov, Sarah Chang, Frank Huang."
3,"Great playing, but...","I admit being a little disappointed by the relative lack of passion. The Elgar is perhaps the most overly romantic of concertos, and I find myself preferring other renditions, including those of Perlman, Chung, and even Heifetz. As a violinist, I admire Hahn's technical facility and pure tone- there is no question she is an absolute master. The third movement contains some astonishing playing, but the lovely second movement seems a bit lifeless. I hate to be critical of her playing, but she has some tall competition.Her style seems to lend itself better in the Vaughan Williams, and given the beautiful music writing, this CD may be well worth it afterall.I don't discourage anyone from obtaining this CD, but if you're looking for just one recording of the Elgar, you may be better off elsewhere."
3,Old idea,"Christians have heard this argument a thousand times, but few really know what people mean by saying that little in Christianity is original. This book provides you with the reasoning behind this claim in an exhaustive way. I found this book to be a much better choice than any of Robert Price's books because Price gets his ideas (or most of them) from this author. For a good counter-argument I recommend The Jesus Legend by Eddy and Boyd."
1,Broken after 6 months,The 'toe post' (the part between your toes) broke out of the sole after six months. Unfortunately my girlfriend threw them out before I could send them back to Dr. Marten's for replacement. They were comfortable while they lasted.
1,Misinformation?,"Sad to see so many glowing reviews of this book. Depressing to realize how readily misinformation is accepted as fact with the reviewers thoughtlessly indulging in the spread of misinformation themselves. If you must read this book make sure you also read Ranulph Fiennes' ""Captain Scott""."
5,Great Read,"You wouldn't think that a bunch of guys running around in the ice and snow would be such a compelling read, but this is the book that started my fascination with the Polar Explorers of the 18th and 19th centuries, and made me want to learn more about my Nordic heritage. Whether you agree with Huntford's conclusions or not, his study of Nansen, Amundsen and other Norwegian figures and their country and culture is one that we seldom get from the general US education accounts of these explorations.I recommend this book (or the abridged version that came out as ""The Last Place on Earth"") as a good starting place for people who think they might be interested in the ""Great Polar Explorations,"" because, even if you disagree with his assessment of the leading characters, Huntford does a very good job of laying out the essential problems and dynamics of Polar travel (without becoming completely bogged down in minutiae)."
1,Opportunity Lost.,"A good read but.....was it. Factual? Accurate? Balanced?Wouldn't you expect those basic three elements in a story told? I know I do but maybe I'm too fussy or just nave.Otherwise what is the point? Was it purely to destroy a mans reputation sensationally in order to sell the book! - the cynic in me thinks probably yes, for whatever reason only Roland Hunford knows.I've no doubt a lot of research went into Hunterfords book but what a waste, after having read all the available books on this particular subject matter including Ranulph Fiennnes book, the options expressed by Huntford and the presentation of so called `facts' seem at times downright fictional.If you want the sensational Tabloid version of the Scott story get this book, if you want the three elements mentioned above at least read Ranulph Fiennes book."
2,Ya right your a what? A psychologist?,"I could never get this book. It took my twenty years of reading the Divided Self to fully understand this author. This book was also titled the bird of paradise, but is not the book the other reviewer thought it was, that was also a book by RD Laing but with another author and also had the word *family* in the title. This book originally was not like an accounting of families but philosophical and psychiatric speculation. This book is all fine for someone studying psychology or psychiatry but for fellow consumers of mental health or their families I would say avoid this rather weighty tome."
2,Outrageous Price,"The pricing for this item is insane, especially since it's only 1/3 of the game's music. If you're looking for the battle themes and city music, you may be disappointed as many are absent. There is another 108 track set called piano collections that includes everything on this album as well as the majority of other music. It's also half the price of this. Search around before wasting money."
4,The definitive film of Hong Kong,"I lived in Hong Kong during the late nineties. We used to go to Chungking Mansions for Indian food. We also used to hit Midnight Express in Lan Kwai Fong for kebabs - although the guys working there were not quite as cute as Faye Wong. The novelHong Kong 97, A Corporate Satireis also set in Hong Kong during this period, and brought back a lot of great memories."
5,Enchantment In Hong Kong,"In this intricate romantic tale of frustrated love... Wong Kar Wai paints a vibrant and enchanting picture of Hong Kong and the magical relationship of 4 people and a fast food stand called Midnite Express. Out of the two stories, the second one features Hong Kong/China Pop Diva.. Faye Wong who absolutely steals the whole show..... If you see this movie... you will fall in love with Faye Wong."
5,Wonderful inside view of Hong Kong,"Hong Kong is often a study of the absurd, but it always has a way of captivating you. This movie manages to capture much of both sides of this. While those who know Hong Kong find some of the continuity a little jumpy (how do they get from Hong Kong to Kowloon and back so fast?), it is a gem of a visual introduction to living in the real Hong Kong. Filmed almost entirely within a few blocks around Wellington Street, the escalator and Lan Kwai Fong, you can almost smell the streets as they were 10 years ago. The 2 stories that make up the film are also contrasts - between the sheer pace and mayhem of one to the simple minded childishness of the other. Brilliant."
5,"Watch it twice, Think, Enjoy!","I am a straightforward watcher and am not big on details so I had to watch this movie twice to get something out of it. The actors are brilliant and the story is straddling between reality and the fantasy world. The second story is similar to Amelie but Chungking Express had this aura of ""real"" in it. The film is beautiful and it somehow requires some thinking to fully appreciate it. Wong Kar Wai made this great movie and you should check this movie out if you want to dig for some treasure that you don't get from some superficial movie. THIS MOVIE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT REACHES A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE ONLY. IT'S EITHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T. BUT OF COURSE GIVING IT A SECONG GLANCE CAN MAKE YOU A BELIEVER AFTER ALL. Check it out."
5,Best romantic comedy ever,"I've rated over 1700 movies. Only 49 of them got 5 stars. Chungking Express is the only romantic comedy in that group. If you don't fall in love after watching this flick, you're just creepy, and possibly a Klingon."
3,Neat little film,I like it that famous directors will highlight seemingly publicly obscure films so the rest of us can watch them. The nymph who kept dancing to California Dreams captured my attention by flitting around and messing with peoples stuff. I can't recommend it for most people but if you are looking for something different it is not bad.
3,You will never want to eat canned pineapples again!,"Hong Kong movies seem to dwell on either violence or extremely juvenile love stories. Can anyone explain this? Chungking Express is a perfect example of the genre under the sophisticated cloak of some fine camera work. It contains sappy, unfulfilled love stories that would please any 14 year old. However you would not want to show the movie to a 14 year old because of the violence in the first half of the film.The film ended up getting some rave reviews because of its New Wave look. It does have some innovative parts, but is not worthy of 4 much less 5 stars when compared to far more worthy films. Chungking Express does make one contribution to your waistline as it will definately keep you from wanting to eat canned pineapple."
4,Wong Kar-Wai 101,"This is actually a pretty good introduction to Wong Kar-Wai's impressionistic style of moviemaking. This one has a linear plot (with two stories set end to end) but with his trademark what's-going-on-here storytelling, veeerrry offbeat moments, but this time with sweeping, handheld camera shots.Many fine actors contribute but I must give special praise to tall, skinny and gamine Faye Wong. She's charming in the same way that Audrey Hepburn was -- but prettier and sexier. Like Audrey often did, Faye plays an ultra-free-spirit and is she a heart-breaker! Scantily-clad Valerie Chow provides some potent sex appeal in a couple scenes.Quentin Tarantino provides an on-screen Introduction and Afterword. The Intro is a perfunctory welcome. The lengthier Afterward has some neat behind-the-scenes tidbits -- altho, he mistakenly states that this was Faye Wong's first movie.I thought of giving this film only 3 stars -- but Faye gives it extra ooomph."
2,Does anything happen in this movie?,"So this movie is made of 2 stories. The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin. Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting. So this thing ends and the movie should have also. It should have been a 30 minute movie. So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs. Wow, what a movie. The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day. She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie."
2,LOUSY COVER DESIGN,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE,EVERYONE OF THE CAST IS FANTASTIC.MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS WHAT THE HELL IS QUENTIN OR WHATEVER THAT THING IS CALLED HAS TO HAVE HIS GOD DAMN HEAD ON THE COVER OF THE MOVIE.SHAME!!!"
2,Too confusing...,"I have no idea how this movie could have been shown in the first place. The language switches from Mandarin to Cantonese to English and sometimes Japanese. The first story made absolutely no sense, while the second story was slightly more interesting but downright weird.Both stories seem to have been filmed with a handheld camera making the shots very shakey. Also, both stories seem centered on repeating a single song for a character. Also, the timelines shift so suddenly back and forth that it's hard for anyone to follow.Some people may like this movie, but it made no sense to me."
2,Different? Yes. Good? Well...,"This overrated film by hip oriental director Wong Kar-Wai manages to be mildly intriguing and interesting at times but for the most part it just misses its target. Yes, there is some stylish and neat directing to find here, as well as some weird and offbeat scenes once in a while, yet the movie is ultimately too long and it seems to lack a point. What begins as an appealing story (or stories) about urban alienation and the isolation of some japanese youngsters soon turns into a repetitive, tiresome and, at parts, irritating cinematic experience (""California Dreaming"", anyone??). The characters range from frustrated daydreamers to annoying and erratic losers who can`t seem to find a goal for their lives. ""Chungking Express"" is quircky and kind of amusing here and there, still overall it fails to convince.Average."
5,My favorite movie!,"Just watch it... esp. the 2nd story...I watched it over 5 times and I still love it.*I still don't understand the 1st story.. --;When you watch it, you'll love Tony and Faye. ^o^oh... also... the song called, ""California Dreaming"" by Mamas and Papas..."
3,Good,"Chungking Express is a strange film. This film, directed by Wong Kar-Wai, in an import from Hong Kong. The film deals with two related stories, the second one is more interesting than the first one. This film attacks the senses. Faye Wang is intoxicating in this noir drama. After this film you will have a Mamas and Papas tune in your head for a few days, PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
4,exact replacement for my RV propane tank cover,I purchased these as a replacement for the broken latches on my RV propane tank cover. They were an exact fit. They look and function great. Hopefully the rubber material holds up well over time.
5,Great Case,"Case did not leak, used for 7 days in St. Thomas. I added a few air dryer beads to the case to keep fog out, worked great. case in made very well, very solid."
5,Best Invention Ever!!!,This is the best thing I have ever bought!!! It didn't fog up at all!! My camera fit perfectly and it was so easy to switch between pictures and video. The pictures came out so clear.
5,Awesome,"These are great, my only issue because its 4X lense that it extends out far so that case is a bit bulky otherwise these are bullet proof"
5,Just as ordered,This galvanized floor flange is just as described and very good quality. There is nothing else to say except I recommend it.
3,Good musical performances in an atrocious film,"By most measures, this is an idiotic low-budget movie from 1965 that transplants the beach blanket movie ethos into a coffee house. What little plot there is is foolish, the writing is poor, the ""screwball"" humor is not humorous. It almost insults the viewer.However, it is filled with performances by folk acts, and that made this somewhat worth watching for me. Some of the performers are very commercial, but you also get Oscar Brand, a fascinating glimpse of a very young Joan Rivers doing a comedy routine and, best of all, a couple numbers by the great and now mostly forgotten Vince Martin, whose name deserves to be on the front of the box (look him up if you dont know who he is).So, as a film its junk. As a folk variety show, its uneven but worth checking out to see some rare, vintage performances if you are into that kind of music. Bonus features include commentary from the producer."
5,The Best,"When I was in high school a friend told me about Calandre, and how it was always her mother's favorite perfume. It smelled great on our friend. All of us girls went out and bought Calandre. It had become a favorite for all of us. I use to be able to buy it at the upper scale department stores. It is difficult to find now. Calandre remains my favorite. I am passing it on to my 2 girls for Christmas. I hope they like it too!"
2,Not as remembered,It has been many years since I've used this product. It had been my exclusive scent for many years. The present scent is not as I remember it. Not at all. I can't imagine that I would have liked it back then if it smelled as it does today. I was very disappointed and returned it.
2,Not the same!,"I have loved this fragrance for forty years. The last bottle I bought was near the end and I no longer live near my fragrance shop. I saw it on Amazon and thought ""yeah""! It is nothing like the wonderful scent it should be.. There is an unpleasant, metallic sort of finish to the scent. I looked into returning but found it couldn't be done. I am stuck with an expensive bottle of disappointment."
3,Italian spoof,"Bud Spencer stars as Bud Graziano a former heavyweight boxing champ who loses a fight after a crooked army sarge hit his right hand and leaves to be a sailor.A boxing promoter offers him to train a new challenger so he accepts and train the kid until he fights to Rosco Dunn the sarge Bomber fought.As like all the Bud Spencer movies we have lots of punches,hits quickie moves and humor.Shot entirely in Rome some scenes remember me of Rocky(the training scenes.Entertaining only for Spencer fans."
3,A good movie,"Being a fan of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies, including the music, I reckon this movie is good. That is even although it's not considered one of Bud Spencer's best comedies. (Otherwise there would surely be more editions and releases of it.)A South African, Kallie Knoetze, plays the part of an American soldier boxer. The movie is also a good example of how American soldiers can misbehave in a foreign country, and therefore be disliked.The movie has basically the same story as ""They called him Bulldozer"", an earlier Bud Spencer comedy. (That's with the gridiron, not the ninja.) A lot of Hollywood (& Hollywood type) movies have similar stories. I'd say that if getting this movie, also get ""They Called Him Bulldozer"", for the complete story.I liked that dune buggy, which is quite fancy and impressive. There is also good Austrian/Bavarian folk music."
2,Flannel nightgown,"Due to lack of long flannel nightgowns available in thelocal business community, I ordered this nightgown on-linethrough Amazon.com. I knew most flannel nightgowns aren'twhat you call sexy, but expect them to be cozy, warm and durable. The ordering process was great, received theitem within 10 days. The gown was plain, but true to thepicture. The problem I found was the item began to frayat a shoulder seam within 3 washings. Durable it is not.I am required to send the item back for a refund. Because of the experience, I will think twice before ordering clothing over the internet.Long Striped Flannel Gown by Carole"
5,Not just for Granny!,"I recently purchased this gown for my wife for Christmas. Her request was for a purple flannel full length. That's exactly what she got and she was very pleased. I read a lot of reviews with complaints slow delivery, but I found that not the case my order came in 7-9 days standard shipping rate. I will purchase again with this company!"
3,Nightgown is late!!! (and small),"My mom is 94 and she needed an old fashioned nightgown like this. I could not find one in the store. I ordered Medium, but it was way too small. And she is 5, 4 weighs 110, it should have fit her. So, I returned it for a large. But I still have not received it. I am spoiled by Amazon, usually I get things so fast!!! I think a month has passed and I still do not have the correct size nightgown. So, I am frustrated by the delay."
3,"National Long Striped Flannel Nightgown, Aqua, Medium - Long",The grown is not what I expected. I think I should have bought one in the store. I would have liked one with the arms longer.
2,Not So Much . . .,"I wanted a long flannel nightgown, and I liked this style. I was disappointed after the first washing, however. It shrank so much, I could not wear it. It does run small, anyway, but the length became too short to keep me warm. More like a ballerina length after washing. It was pretty, just shrunk too badly."
5,Alice is a delight!,"I'm a librarian and got turned on to this series by some of our younger patrons who like it. I love reading kids' and YA books myself so I thought it would be fun to read it. I decided to start the series with Alice being at the youngest age, so picked up this one. It was thoroughly enjoyable. Alice is charming and her eight-year old voice is captured pitch perfect. Her happy and sad moments are captured wonderfully. I can't wait to ""grow up"" with her!"
2,Reiki Healing Attunement Heal Emotional-Mental-Physical-Spiritual Issues,"Personally,, I found this video to be a little (rather a lot) disappointing. The video did not attempt provide any background history, understanding, or explanations of the Reiki Attunement process, symbols, or training. Also, since the primay focus (instrument) used in the Attunement Process was a large Crystal Quartz Stone, the fact that the ""stone"" brilliance, color, and character was entirly loss (not captured) in the video made the video worthless, in my opinion. The Videographer failed miserably in capturing the stones quality or natural color, brilliance, or character. Instead it appeared as a discolored rock of little significance.I think Steve Murray missed the mark with this video, as it was ""too little value"" for the cost. Next time, I hope he finds a better cameraman or videographer for the shoot. He should and could also provide more background on the Reiki Attunement process and purpose."
5,"View, review and repeat","I concur with all the positive things the other reviewers have said about Steve Murray's great books, DVDs and CDs. The important thing with the DVDs in my view is that they should be watched over and over again, not only for the attunements, but for the wonderful meditation experience you will have. I watch one of the attunement DVDs every other day or so and find that my day goes better when I do!"
5,MacCulloch on Thomas Cranmer is a masterpiece,"Exquisely researched and engagingly written, Diarmaid MacCulloch brought to life a figure who played a substantial role in both English and church history during the Reformation, and whose legacy lives on. I feel that for the first time in more than 30 years of bumping into Henry VIII's Archbishop of Canterbury, and of regularly using the Book of Common Prayer that he master-minded, I have properly met the man. MacCulloch obviously adores Cranmer, but is not blind to his shortcomings. He also shows the cost to Cranmer of bringing about fundamental change in the English Church -- ultimately losing his life. I came away from the book marveling at the richness and stature of the Anglican way of believing, and the part Cranmer played in making it happen. I have been heralding it from the housetops! Like all good books, I was sorry when it ended."
4,Flawed Saint of the Church,"MacCulloch's book provides access to the singularly foundational figure of the reformation in England. Most who recognize Cranmer's name at all know him only as the author of the first Prayer Book or the man who attained Henry VIII's annulment from Catherine. MacCullogh gives depth to Cranmer as a flawed yet faithful agent of the Church, one who sought with conviction the reformation of the Church of England but was also willing to slavishly follow his prince in order to achieve that reformation. The final chapter, chronicling Cranmer's fall and ultimate martyrdom, reads with the pace of a good novel. For Episcopalians and others with an affinity for the Anglican tradition, insight into Cranmer's life and thought is crucial, and MacCulloch presents that insight with skill."
1,PetSafe Dog Trainer Overpriced,"This gadget is significantly overpriced for what you get, which is: a large, cumbersome collar attachment which apparently makes little use of technology which would allow minuturization and ease of use. It doesn't even have an indicator to tell whether it is on or off. It must be very tight around the dog's neck to make the proper contact. It is so awkward to use that it was ineffective in focusing the dog's attention."
2,power dies down after a month,i have found out after the first set of battery's dies out the shocking chargedies down because when i first got it I had it set at 4 now i have to set it at 10 to get the same shock. I tested it on my arm both times so i wouldn'thurt my dog unfairly. I am afraid in another month it will be worthless.
2,The battery is a major problem,"If you do not remember to switch the receiver off after each use, you will run out of the battery within 2 weeks. How inconvenient."
2,Training Dog Collar,I was very dissapointed with it because a prong broke off within a few wks of using it otherwise it was working great
5,Thank You PetSafe & Amazon,"The PetSafe dog trainer has worked perfectly with our one year old golden retriever. With only a couple training sessions, he is now behaving very well and if he does get out of line (happens rarely), the audible beep is all that is needed for him to immediately respond to voice commands.We no longer have to worry about him jumping on furniture, houseguests, etc. In addition, he is now receiving more attention than ever as people seem to love a well-behaved dog much more. Thank you PetSafe & Amazon!"
3,Pro's and Con's,"The concept of this product is good , however, it could use some improvements. I purchased one a year ago. Within a couple of weeks I had to return it to the manufactuer because it was defective - sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not. They replaced it with a reconditioned one. The replacement unit works, but it rapidly drains batteries even with very little use. The remote should be redesigned - accidentally drop it and the battery pops out. I keep the portion of my dog's neck shaved in the region of the collar unit so the unit can make good contact with the skin. Nonetheless, I still have to keep intensity level on 8 or 9 (out of 1-10), otherwise my dog doesn't even notice a correction. On the plus side, the product has been very useful in reinforcing off-leash recalls with my dog, even with lots of distractions present."
1,Would not recommend,Arrived with dead batteries. Waited 10 days for replacement batteries. Collar and remote lights showed green.. Dog NEVER responded to collar. Returned collar and waiting to be credited. Would not recommend this collar. Probably would not purchase another collar online.
3,Good for less intense dogs,"I bought this to use on my boxer, and for training purposes, it worked. She would not come when called outside, and this collar solved this problem. I also used it on a smaller dog on a lower setting, and it worked. However, I have recently began fostering a 50 lb pitbull and he doesn't even flinch with the highest setting on this collar. He is extremely intense with other dogs and will completley ignore the collar. I spoke with a dog trainer and she uses a dogtra collar (not available through retail, try eBay) which is rechargeable and she's had it for 10 years! With all the money I've spent on replacing batteries I might as well have just bought the dogtra collar in the first place. I have used this collar on the pit and it works!!!"
2,NOT Waterproof!!,"I ordered this collar for it's price, mostly positive ratings, and because it's ""waterproof"". The last one was a must, since I have 2 water dogs - lab and weimaraner - and planned to use it on my lab (who runs off and ceases to listen to me at all). I tried it on in the yard, worked fine I guess, but might have been inconsistent (she sometimes reacted to the buzz, sometimes not, and it was on the same setting... faulty collar or selective dog?). We went out on a walk, and they of course went for a swim, and then of course she ran off. Ready, set - buzz! Nothing. At all. Whenever she did decide to wander back my way I readjusted and tried the tone - nothing. Got home, took the batteries out and had to dry them off! Not sure if the unit will work once it dries out, but regardless I'm returning it. It says waterproof, I expect it to be waterproof. Guess I'll have to get a more reliable model, even if it is more expensive."
2,Dead on Arrival,"The collar quite simply did not work at all. I called the number given in the brochure to get help. To my surprise they were really nice and helpful. We determined that it was defective and needed to be returned. It is because of the good customer service that I gave the product two stars, otherwise it would have been one."
2,Be carful with this collar,"Was great to begin with, however after about six months of use. My dog on two seperate times started yelping for no reason, in fact i did not even have the remote in my hand. There was another issue of distance and that I would only get about 100 feet max. After this, i purchased another one and have since had no issues."
2,Deluxe dog trainer,"I purchased this product because my dog likes to take off and play in the street. I am always outside w/ her so I decided to opt for this particular model rather than pay hundreds of dollars for an invisible fence. When this product works it is very effective. I have found though, that many times I will depress either the sound or the shock buttons and nothing will happen. The batteries are new so it is my opinion that this product chooses when it wants to work."
4,Dog Zapper,Love this product. Now we can keep our dog. We were ready to take it to the pound!It's made life so much easier. We aren't yelling at the dog anymore just a little warning sound and he's an angel. When people come to visit and the dog goes crazy a few little zaps and he's not bothering our guests.We're very happy!
1,NOT water proof!!!,"Although this item is advertized as ""waterproof"", it is not! It stopped working the moment my dog went into the water. Otherwise worked fine. The DOGTRA shock collar works better and is waterproof."
2,batteries need some help,You will end up spending more on batteries than the collar itself. I've replaced the batteries twice in a month and have delivered very few actual 'shocks'. I'll go with a rechargeable collar next time.
2,Does not go the distance.,"I have only used the sound on my dog, which luckily is enough to scare her into acting right. However, I have to be standing about 20 yards away for it to connect. The product claims it will work up to 100 yards. Wrong. I can be standing without any obstructions in the way and it does not work until I walk closer to my dog. This is frustrating as part of the reason I got it was to keep her out of my neighbors yard without actually having to go into the yard to get her."
4,Decent collar for the price,"This is a pretty decent collar for the price. I had one before that was almost the exact same thing, except the remote and collar both took 9 volt batteries, which was more convenient. This collar is a little stronger, I only had to put it on 7 and my 100lb Staffie knew I meant business. I would have given it a 5 if it took regular batteries, I haven't gone to the store to try and find the ones it uses yet, hopefully I can find them. For now I have just been turning the collar off anytime I know I won't have to use it, I guess I'll see how long the batteries last. But overall its a pretty good collar."
4,Pavlov was right,"It only took a few beeps and mild shocks to get my German Shorthair Pointer to listen. She had graduated from positive-training obedience school, but only because they must have had a ""no dog left behind"" program. I used this collar to break her of three bad habits - not coming when called, jumping over the rabbit fence into the garden and digging. She now listens when called, stays out of the garden and shys away from her favorite digging spots. When she relapses into her bad habits, I only need to beep it to get her to listen. This product was definitely worth buying."
1,Painful for dog,"I ordered this product to use on my 1.5 year old Boxer Mix because she is having behaviorial issues such as jumping, tugging on leash, etc. The tone button worked occasionally with her such as when she was tugging on the leash. When it came to her jumping, I would have to use the ""SHOCK"" button and I say shock because I had to set it so high - 7 or 8 - for it to make any impact and at that point, it hurt her, causing her great pain. I returned the item and do not recommend the use of it on any animal."
4,PetSafe PDBDT Delux Big-Dog Trainer,I found the product to preform as advertised. If you have a large dog that jumps up on people this is a good way to train them. After only a few training sessions our dog reacts to the sight of the remote control as well as the tv remote.
2,Works Sporadically,"When the remote is working properly is works well. However, it often doesn't work. I changed batteries and it still has very sporadic performance. You cannot expect it to work at a distance of over 10 yards. Most times is works 50-75% of the time. The quality of the remote is cheap plastic. After a few months of use, the remote started to fall apart and made it difficult to press the buttons. Also the dial for the level of shock doesn't seem very accurate.Generally, I wouldn't recommend this device. Find a better more reliable one."
4,Good middle-of-the-road product,"This was a very reasonably priced product that had pretty much everthing we needed to train our dog on one stubborn habit. It had decent range, the tone warning was a good option, and the batteries lasted about as long as the manufacturer said it would. After about the first day, we rarely had to use the shock feature.Only word of advice, if your dog likes water, you might want to get the waterproof one, because you'll probably forget your dog has it on when he jumps into the ocean."
4,Pretty good shock colar,This product works pretty well. Sometimes it dosent respond easily when activated but for the most part I'm happy with it.This unit was aprox. $60 and was well worth it.
3,Worked for about a month.,I have an 8 month old Chocolate lab. He weighs about 75 pounds and is very stubborn. I purchased this collar because he only listened when and where he wanted to. The first day i got this my dogs behavior was amazing. The second he was still good come the third he was back to his normal self. The funny part is that i hardly shocked him because i did not want to get him used to the shock. So he was only shocked when needed yet he seemed to have gotten used to it. I had it a month when i dropped it on my patio and that was it. It never worked again. I have now upgraded to a more expensive unit and am very happy with my choice.
2,Marginal performance,"This item worked well when it worked. The sound and shocker didn't always work. I had to press the buttons several times to get to activate. Battery performance, as noted in other reviews, was also unimpressive. The extra batteries that I bought from Amazon were not the correct ones, so that was another $7 lost. Also, the clip on the collar broke, so now it's safety pinned. For nearly $100 I feel they could use decent material. It did improve my dog's behavior, but the hassle in it's use only gets it two stars."
2,Not good for the long haul,"We really liked this trainer at first. It did help to get our dog's attention and he nicely became more cooperative. However, it has never worked for a distance. It only works for about 10 feet. We've had it for over a year and have dealt with increasing problems. The batteries need replacing every two weeks, the shock works sporatically, and a couple of times the stimulation (shock) button stuck, which was not at all what we would ever want to happen. I would suggest you look for a collar with rechargable batteries and one for longer distances."
1,This product is unsafe,"We purchased this item to help train a very enthusiastic yellow lab. The controller was setting on a table. The dog was wearing the collar. Suddenly, it went off for no reason.(there was no one near the unit and there are no children in my home to wonder about.) The poor dog ran thru the house ""screaming."" The thing would not shut off. My husband turned it all the way down, finally caught the dog, and yanked the collar off of him. I have contacted the seller twice to get a return authorization. They will not return my calls. What a waste of almost $100.00 after shipping."
1,product doesn't work,"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this and knew that batteries might be an issue, so when my collar didn't work properly, I bought new batteries hoping that was the problem. The collar never worked below a setting of 5, and rarely worked above that setting. When it did work, it was inconsistent in its power. Additionally, its range was less than 15 feet--not much help when your dog is racing around the backyard or throughout the house in a barking frenzy. This is a product that needs to be consistent if it is to be helpful."
5,Great product!,"I was hesitant ordering this product, but now I am glad. We adopted a 2 year old lab that barked at everything and anything. After just a few times using the ""beeper"" option made a world of difference."
4,Dog Training collar,"Initial collar I ordered stopped working after about a week. I believe it was possibly defective. However, Amazon quickly sent me a replacement free of charge. Second collar seems to be working fine. I was very happy with the service I received for the replacement."
1,Did not work,The dog trainer collar did not work... the sound alarm worked but the shock option did not. I changed the batteries and it still would not give the electic shock. Defective product!
2,"Range is hit and miss, burns through batteries like crazy.","The range on this collar is hit and miss, mostly miss. We also found that the batteries in the collar unit needed to be replaced almost weekly, even though we vary rarely used the remote (we used the sound correction 99% of the time, rather than the shock). The cost of the batteries makes this collar a poor investment."
3,OK but doesn't do the distance,"Supposed to work up to 100yards, it only works up to maybe 75feet. But it does work well within that range."
3,Large Dog Shock Collar,"Good collar, but I have a Great Alaskan Malamut, live in AK, and a couple of issues.1. Connector poles that stick out and against dog's neck are not long enough (even the long ones).2. Insufficient power to really get dog's attention if he/she's a really big dog. Plus you have to to keep adjusting to dog's neck (and must shave dog's neck area to ensure it connects)."
3,It works well when it works,"There's not much to it, one button for a ""beep/buzz"" and one for a shock. There is a dial on the remote that allows you select the level of the shock.The biggest issue that I have with the unit is that it doesn't always work when I push the button. I often have to push the button 3-5 time before the receiver gets the signal.I have a bloodhound and they are a very stubborn bread. One shock with the color and she will stop what's she doing and never does it again! I seldom ever have to give her a shock. A quick beep/buzz and she runs right to my side. I just wish it was more reliable."
2,Works SOMETIMES,"When this product works right it is 100% effective. The problem it doesn't work all the time for some reason the signal does not reach the collar. It has nothing to do with yardage, walls or batteries, it just doesn't work all the time............"
1,Big Mess,My credit card was charged $97.89 on Feb 3. No book ever arrived. I can't believe that the correct price is that high for one single book.Please advise.
4,Dog Traimer,I love this collar. I have only had to use the sound and my dog has almost stopped all her jumping. All I have to do now is just put it on her.
2,Not what is promised.,I don't like it at all.The first day it self the collar started to rip apart from the ends.It says it is suitable for dogs over 40lbs.Not true.My dog is 45lbs and it doens't work.My dog is not even bother by the buzzer or the shock.There is no change in his behaviour.Plus the batteries die very very fast.Since I bought it I have changed the batteries 3 times.Would not recommend at all.
4,Although the device is not the same as pictured....,"it is the UPDATED version of the product. It also has a nicer appearance. So far, it's working well and my dog seems to respond."
5,Dog Collar,"We live on a busy street, but could not afford to put in an electric fence. This electric collar with hand held remote is working very well as we train our eight month old puppy. Most of the time she responds to the ""tone"" so we don't have to use the ""zapper"" part, which makes both my husband and I very happy/pleased. Although there are no actual ""boundaries"" in our yard she is learning by repeated actions just how far she can go."
1,disappointed,"Why would anyone put the on/off botton on the dog collar where the dog can turn it off??? Other than that it works good. When I need to use it, first I have to make sure he has not turned it off, test it, then I can use it. It seems to me that the on/off control should be on the controller...not the collar. and not where the dog can roll around and press the on/off button."
5,stopped our German Shepherd from jumping on people yay!,"I know there are people out there that are against ""zapping"" your pooch--but honestly it helped much quicker with our pooches bad manners. Our 65 lb shepherd would jump on everyone..and them claws on a larger dog do damage especially to little kids. We got this collar and the jumping stopped immediately..we could now have guests over without having to ""prepare"" them. It also helped on walks as our dog would bark and stare down other dogs. She always got along at the dog parks, but for some reason walking and passing neighbors dogs she would not be a happy camper. So this collar made it easier as I feared her provoking would trigger another dog at some point..so when the ""no no's"" happened a ""zap"" would snap her out of it. I do suggest having back up batteries for the collar...and ALWAYS start ""correction levels"" at the low settings to see what level works it goes up to a 10---ours was fine at 5."
3,Big Dog Trainer,Batteries are expensive but you can find them for much less on Amazon. Initially I was going to return and purchase a collar with a rechargeable battery. I have found that if you don't need to leave the collar on for an extended period of time the battery life is acceptable.The collar works but not all the time. It depends what is between the remote and the collar. I have only had to us the shock a few times. My dog responds the the tone very well. There is a big change in her behavior and the price is relatively reasonable.I would not spend the extra money on the rechargeable unit.
4,Very good product - eats batteries!,"We dont shock our dog much, but we used it for training to break his attention on certain things...like our cats. Level 4 and 2-3 shocked when he would make chase has set things striaght. Level 3 to stop a bark outside, and after a few occasions he got the idea no to bark at everything. We used it with verbal commands, mostly NO, so he knows when we now say NO he better stop whats he's doing. And he does.Batteries only last about 2-3 weeks, even if you arent shocking."
1,Should have believed the bad reviews,"I have had a variety of training collars and thought that I would try the PetSafe Deluxe Big Dog. The price seemed good and I thought that I would listen to the good reviews and give it a chance. What a mistake!!! In open air, it transmitted thirty yards at best and at the highest level made my Springer Spaniel mildly shake his head. And this was after my tightening the collar to ensure good contact. Very disappointing."
2,Expensive to operate,"This will deter your dog from barking, but the cost for battery replacement is expensive. Setting the dial to a lower shock number is helpful, and it only takes a couple warning sounds followed by a short zap to get the point across. After which, sound warnings will do the job. But, even after only using sound to warn your dog, the batteries run down quite quickly and will need to be replaced every 6-10 days."
4,Works when it works!,"This collar has helped immensely with my dogs problems such as running off & jumping up. Although at time it seems to be in-responsive, & it doesn't work on the 1st press sometimes. It got wet and still works so that's a plus but I didn't let my dog swim with it, don't want to chance it even though it says it's water prof. Would have been nice if it came with an extra collar for the receiver, I will need one soon & don't know where to get one. Over all it's a 4 out of 5 stars product."
1,Unreliable Product,I bought this product with a life-and-death importance. My rescue Great Dane is aggressive toward cats. I tried the collar on myself and turned the shock rating up to 5 before I got a little jolt. Then I tried it on my dog and calibrated according to the instructions. I presented the cat and got limited reaction even on the highest 10 setting. I tried the collar on myself on bare skin. I felt a shock about one in four times -- on my bare skin.This product is unreliable.
5,Very effective training aid,"This product was a last resort for our very stubborn puppy. We tried for almost a year to get him to stop jumping on us and to calm his behavior. I wish we would have tried this first. As soon as we started using it, he started behaving better. Now, we rarely use the shock function. The audible beep does the trick 99% of the time! I would recomend this to anyone with a very strong willed puppy that is a bit of a handfull."
3,PetSafe Dog Collar,"You have to push the button just right for it to work properly, which sometimes is too late to correct your dog. My dogs got to the point where if you just pulled out the controller, they'd settle down."
3,"So, So performance",Maybe I expected too much from this product. I am trying to control excessive barking.The product only seems to jolt the dog every now and then. I used the longer electrodes and tightened the collar with no noticable results. I just got the dog back from the groomer so let's see if shorter coat hair will allow collar to work.
3,Duke,It has work for our dog for the most part.From my point it doesn't have no 100 yard range thoe.Its hit and miss at a distance you have to press the button a few time to get it to react at a 100ft.with out moving closer.An for a dog we are having problem digging yard up hard to catch him by supprise while he is in action because he hears you coming.It not the batteries ethier tested plus its been like that since we received it new.
2,not consistent,Disappointed with this product. It states it delivers a correction up to 300 feet. It was unreliable when out in the open. it does not work unless the control and dog are facing each other. If the dog is running away from the person it didn't work consistently or even at all if the animal was more than 150 feet away.
2,Not so good...,"I recently purchased this product and found that the remote isn't working properly. There appears to be a short or a poor connect in the remote button that activates the collar. I have to push several times to get it to work, if it will work at all. I am exchanging the device for another. When it did work, it worked as expected."
4,PetSafe Deluxe Big Dog Trainer (PDBDT-305),"I have a 9 month old Akita mix puppy with several bad habits. When nothing was working to control his bad habits, a friend of mine suggested this collar. It has worked wonders for me and is not cruel to the animal. This is a better alternative to getting rid of the animal. I would recommend it for dogs with any kind of problem."
4,2 rowdy dogs,I have to rowdy dogs at home who just turned over 9 months and they are very much still in that puppy stage. They are constantly running around and biting each other but they do actually like each other. After my dogs chewed up my carpet and part of my bathroom wall I reached my breaking point and realized that they really didn't take me serious when I scolded them. I was hesitant as many people are to use a shock collar but my only other option was to find a different home for at least one of them but I really really didn't wanna do that. So I invested in this product and after trying it on myself first I realized that it should definitely get their attention. After the first night I noticed a change in my rowdiest dog and it was so great to have a peaceful and calm night! I think this is one of my best investments! Thanks so much!
4,Made my 7 month old German Shep. Listen! But...,"The collar worked wonders for our shep!! She is 7 months old and is super nuts with barking, whining, chewing, biting my other dog and being a general pain in the rear. Within two days of using the collar, she has started listening and breaking those bad habits!! All we have to do it show her the remote and she stops the behavior!!The ONLY draw back we've found is that the batteries (supplied) for the collar itself died with in a week. I figured that it was because they are an ""off"" brand and who knows how long they've sat in that box?!We love the collar so far, and it's been working great!!"
4,Well worth the money!,"I purchased this on 05/28/08 as a last resort for an out of control German Shepherd/collie mix. She was constantly bitting (in a playful manner, but at 72 pounds, it doesnt feel playful), jumping, chasing animals/cars/people, running into the middle of the street, and barking nonstop! I am happy to say that after the first few uses (it took her a couple times to associate the noise/shock with bad behavior, she is now very sweet and very well behaved. For about the past 2 weeks we have even been able to take her into the yard and area around the house without a leash. She stops when told to stop, for the most part, and when she doesnt all that is typically needed is just to show her the remote and she will stop. Very happy with this purchase! I did give it a 4 because the buttons do stick if you are not careful. It is VERY important to watch and make sure the red light goes out on the remote and does not continue to shock her."
4,Good training method,This really works well with our German Shorthaired Pointer. He immediately stops whatever he's doing at the time he gets zapped. He often responds just to the beep sound only. My only beef is that the battery has a short life and it's an expensive battery to replace.
3,Big Dog E-Collar Gobbles Batteries,"Received item from Amazon.com in expected time and in good shipping condition. Purchased PetSafe Deluxe Big Dog Trainer, PDBDT-305 to replace same model I borrowed from my neighbor, that quit working while in my possession. I thought my dog may have damaged the collar in some way, but in truth, the thing went through 2-button-type 2032 batteries about every 4 days even from the start. The quick drain of battery power, not to mention the stress on earth's environment with excessive use & discard of batteries, did not seem appropriate. As mentioned, I purchased this model to replace the borrowed collar, but purchased a different one (rechargeable via house electric outlet) for my dog."
1,Junk,Bought this for over 100.00. It has about 1/4 distance when it actually works. The batteries last about half of what they tell you. DONT BUY.
2,Small lifetime,"Batteries run out quickly on the reciever. It worked well at first, then quickly lost it's consistency. I would press the button up to 10 times before I heard a beep. My dog did not do well with it. Currently looking for another one, and wishing I had not spent $100+ on this item."
1,will not work,The first two would not work. The third one worked about one week. Even if it did work it kills the battery over night.
2,Did not work correctly out of the box,"Could not get a shock out of most numbers. 4 would work sometimes, maybe 10. Other numbers, could get no response. I also borrowed my neighbors model which was the exact same. Any number under 4 would not work. I would not recommend this product."
4,Works great,"I have used this collar for training my standard poodle with the help of an expert for great success on a reliable recall. Also used for unwanted behaviors around the house like barking at neighbors and trying to lick the grease under the outdoor grill. I had to buy this new one because the first got sprayed by a skunk and could not get the odor out. Only drawback is although the unit is waterprrof, the nylon collar will get stinky if you allow it to get wet very much."
4,Great choice!,"We purchased this for our 1 year old dog, with a baby on the way I could not handle her jumping on everyone! At first we were skeptical thinking it would take her cheerful personality away; however, she is still our ornery loving little girl! This collar helped a lot! I believe our dog was only shocked twice, and then the beep button seemed to work great! 1 thing I can say is be consistent! We backed off for a while and she started jumping again, but not nearly like she was! That was error on our part. I know feel much more comfortable bringing our little boy home :)"
2,It's OK for short distance,"This product is good for 20-40 yards, not the 100 that they claim. I did sent it back to seller and bought the Field Trainer collar instead and have been very happy with that. The battery on the Big Dog Trainer does need to be replaced often, whether you use the collar or not. It just doesn't hold much power at all.If you are in the market for a training collar, serious think of getting a rechargeable one, you will be much happier with it."
2,Cheaply Made,"I bought this remote/collar set from Petco. this was the cheapest collar in the store, so I bought it figuring my dog is only about 30 pounds and deaf so its not like he needs some crazy 400 yard sport dog collar. My first impression was that the remote is large and cumbersome, but I figured it would only be a minor irritation. I took my dog to the park, where I dropped by accident the remote on the grass, and the backing popped off. I figured maybe I didn't have it on right, so I put the remote back together... Next time it fell the remote came apart again, and this time I lost the backing and couldnt find it at all. Needless to say I returned the collar the next day and bought the next most expensive model (also by petsafe) which I have not had any problems with. This one however is a waste of good money. Spend the extra 30 dollars and get something well put together."
2,pretty much useless,"I bought this to help train my golden retriever. He has been jumping up on cars that come into the driveway. First, the collar is huge, there has to be a good foot of extra collar - what size dog this is for, I don't know. I am afraid to cut off the excess - afraid the collar will unravel. He chews on the excess. Second, when it is activated he simply turns his head and continues his behavior. By the size it appears to be made for a large dog, but does not give enough oomph for a big dog. I consider this to be a huge waste of money."
1,unsatisfied,"I have used the product very little, goes through batteries fast and now it does not work at all. First the shock stopped and then the beep stopped. Do not waste you money. Used a total of about one month."
2,Like it? Not so much.,"I only tried it twice because my dog(85lb American Staffordshire Terrier, AKA pit bull) is so easily freaked out that her only response was to yelp and run to her safe hiding place. She could make no connection to a behavior or command at all. Yes I tried it on myself first out of curiosity, no real big deal. I never had it turned up past 1/2 way. Now I'm stuck with $60 worth of electronics I don't want."
5,Love It!!!,"We were having so many issues with our ten month black lab who is 90 lbs and due to his size I couldn't have him rule the house or me, this collar has made a 100 percent change in him and some things you can just use the tone and no shock and he is learning to respond. The only bad thing is we have him on the highest setting already due to his size so I don't know if it is as strong as I need for him, however I am going to try new batteries and see what happens then. But overall well worth the money!"
5,stress free dog training!,Exactly what we needed for our little Jack. No more embarrassing episodes at the park or on the trail! Easy to use. I highly recommend this to any dog owner needing the extra reinforcement for training.
3,A good distraction,Just started working with the collar and so far it has done and is doing what they said it would. It's been in the water a few times (short dunks)and there hasn't been a problem. Also My dog has very thick hair under her neck so I had to shave the area where the contacts meet the skin.
4,collar,"So far my husband and I are pleased with the results of this product. Before using it my English Bulldog had some behavioral issues, i.e. jumping on people, peeing on his bed, not minding in general. Most of the time we only have to use the tone correction button for him, which usually does the trick. Our dog's behavioral issues are much better than before using the collar, and I would reccommend this product to others."
2,You get what you pay for,"I've been wanting to try one of these collars for a while, and finally decided on this one. I was kind of disappointed, but then again, I guess you get what you pay for. I can never get this thing to work properly on a continual basis. It seems to have a mind of it's own on if it will work or not. Just testing before even putting the collar on my dog, 6 time out of 10 it wouldn't work (testing the tone)The push button for the on/off could have been designed better, and the buttons on the remote are kind of sensitive. Just slightly pressing the button, the light would come on, but not send a signal to the collar.I wouldn't buy this again. But maybe I just got a bad unit"
2,Lasted exactly 2 years before breaking,for $83 bucks after tax it should last longer than 2 years. Also battery time doesn't last that long (about a week for a heavy barking dog) batteries cost about $2 each
3,Good product..at close range,this product works fine until the dog is around 30-35yrd from you..goes thru batteries kinda quick too and there not easy to find and your store...
1,Would rather use some other method.,"I used the shock collar just for one session. Shocked my dog 4 times. When he received a shock he stopped and looked confused. I think the shock collar is similar to electrical shock therapy. It may destroy brain tissue.Before I used it on my dog I touched the terminals with the fingers of one hand and pressed the shock button. It was painful and my forearm still feels a little strange, even days later.We wanted the collar to stop our dog from running away. We will try using a long cord to catch him when he takes off and then will yell at him when we pull him in. Hope that works better.Amazon.com is nice anyway, they took the shock collar back."
1,dog training collar,"the collar i recieved was okay, a bit of a problem getting it to work, until i figured out that the batteries sent with the product were weak.so i purchased the correct and should i say more batteries.do amazon have a problem with batteries?"
4,shock collar,"Works Great, the wife brings me the snacks at the beginning of the game. I only had to go to level 3. Thank you"
1,Shock did not consistently work,"I have two mad barkers. I tried this on the smaller of our two dogs first and noticed he had no reaction. So, I took the collar off of him and tried it on my own arm. Sometimes the shock came when I pushed the remote control button and sometimes it didn't, regardless of what new batteries I used. I took it to the store where I bought it (Pet Smart) and exchanged it. The 2nd model did the same thing. You can't train/teach a dog without reliable consistency. Therefore, I give this aide one star. It is too expensive to be unreliable!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased the collar in November 2009, it worked on and off, with very limited range. However, a few months later it has malfunctioned and burned my dog and left her with a burned area of raw skin over the majority of her neck.DO NOT BUY THIS COLLAR"
4,Great Product!,"This product really works! I have a six-month-old German Shepherd puppy that likes to run a little more rampant than I would like her to do. Her listening skills are coming along, but with this Dog Trainer she is responding more quickly as commanded. I like that it has the tone sound button and also the shock button. She responds to the tone when needing corrected because she knows that the shock will follow if she does not listen. She has made great strides with her commands. One thing though, I had to call Customer Service and order the longer shock prongs because she has so much long hair under her neck in order to get her attention with the shock maneuver. The company charges you an additional $9.99 plus shipping."
2,Good while it lasts,"This was the best thing when we first got it. Our lab mix puppy was like a new dog. And then it stopped working, and then it worked, and then it stopped working and that kind of defeated the purpose. Although some of her behaviors were somewhat corrected (only need to say ""no"" once, as opposed to over and over), without the consistency, some behaviors have reverted back. I had amazon replace the original and the second one did the same thing. I'm afraid when it comes to these training collars, you get what you pay for. I am now ordering a Dogtra training collar as I have friends with personal experience on how great they are, but am paying a much higher price tag. It will be worth it to have our puppy become the pup we know she can be. I wouldn't recommend this training collar, but do recommend training collars in theory."
3,Got what I payed for ;-),"I should of spent the extra money and gotten one that would have a little more power and reach to it. I used it (after going through all kinds of training classes and positive reinforcement treats, clickers, etc) on my German Short hair pointer and even on level 10 it wont come anywhere near stopping her from running off into the woods after a scent, let alone after a live squirrel ;-)But I guess I should not complain as it was not very expensive.I had it on my Italian Cane Corso male, weighing in at over 90 lbs and he responds to a level 3 and no longer pulls on the leash.It is easy to use and understand, comes with clear instructions."
1,"Unit on dog turns off, and need to be very close to dog.","I was very excited to receive this based on reviews, but I am more than disappointed. In fact, I am returning the unit.When the unit works as designed, it is wonderful for training. Please note I said WHEN.There are two problems.First, the on/off switch is attached to the collar, which is just a little rubber button that you push in, as opposed to a switch that you would put into an on position. The unit is constantly turned off. The only thing I can imagine is that when our dog is playing (she is a big dog) that her toys are pushing the button in and turning it off. It is not a problem with the batteries.Secondly, once I have made sure that the collar unit is on, when I try to correct the dog, i need to be very close to her. I would say less than 10 feet. This does not work very well since by the time I approach her with the remote, she starts to approach me, tail wagging. Hence, I am not able to correct the bad behavior at all."
2,Unsatified,We have an old english bulldog and it didn't work on him. The customer service said it would when I called inquiring about the product. The battery didn't stay tight so the remote didn't work half the time. I ended up returning the product.
3,good but not great,This product is basically very good and does what they advertise. I've used both buttons(tone&stimulation)with success. I try to use only tone and have found it works great. My dogs respond to the tone but on occasion I have had to use the other. The problems with this product are as follows; 1)the buttons stick..and if your in stimulation mode can cause pain for the dog(and anxiety for you). 2)The batteries go fast so turn the unit off if you're not training. 3)The collar is NOT waterproof. My dog loves playing in the sprinkler..when she's done so is the collar and it's off to the store to buy another $100 unit. Overall I recommend it. A lower price would be nice :)
4,SCARY!!,"I thought thsi book was really fun and scary! I liked all the animals in it and Chloe, Maya, and Will remind me of me and my friends in school. I hope this author continues to write more books like this, because it was really good!"
4,a fun read,this book is fun to read but the first part of the book when she is working in the merchants house is a five star read while the second half just doesnt measure up. but i would still strongly recommend reading this book and i plan to read the authors new soon to be released book as well
3,Vacuous light entertainment,"Entertaining enough, the historical period was obviously well reseached, however, it was written with simple and often repetitve language. The author teased us with the idea of herbal simples and pagan beliefs but never really developed the ideas with any kind of detail. It took me half the book to become hooked, but 'simple' or not, in the end I couldn't put it down. A historical Jackie Collins!"
3,Hard to put down,As a reader who enjoys historical novels and was after a light read over the Christmas break this one hit the spot. It kept you intrigued and had the right amount of romance to keep the reader interested. I would particularly recommend it to anyone who likes Diana Gabaldon or Jane Dunn.
3,Predictable and a little far fetched,"This was a fair book, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that is looking for more classic, Medieval action, and I don't mean under the sheets.The storyline is a bit far fetched in consideration with the time period, and I wasn't thrilled with the allusions to mythical gods. The main character, Anne, is likable enough but again far fetched. The things that she does in the book just wouldn't have happened. It bordered on a fantasy novel.All in all, it was OK. Just OK."
2,Pretty clothes and how to remove them...,"This is a lackluster bodice-ripper (literally, in at least two instances) with a heroine who's a confusing (and unconvincing) combination of lust and piety. The 15th-century familial saga of the usurping Yorkists is the flat backdrop to a conventional tale of a virtuous and lovely young serving-woman who discovers -- shockingly! -- that she is really of noble birth. But how will this affect her sex life? Many loving descriptions of velvet gowns and some brief graphic coupling."
5,I loved this book...,I am a voracious reader of English historical novels and biographies. I loved this book and cant wait to read the sequel. I stayed awake into the wee hours to finish it-couldn't stop reading. A wonderful storyline and accurate period details made for a great read. There was just enoughhistorical fact to keep the story real for me.
5,The smell of a pre-Tudor Rose,"The great thing about this book is that you smell the smells (and there are plenty of them, not all pleasant), hear the sounds, taste the food (not always so great), and experience the sensations (biting cold, strange clothing, vermin)of a period far removed from our own.Posie Graeme-Evans is obviously obsessed with the minutiae of the period her heroine inhabits. She loves the houses and the countryside. She loves the stuff of Royalty and greatness. She loves the detail of the food and the sanitary arrangements. But above all she knows how to put it all together and tell a good story. This book rocks along. It's no Georgette Heyer shrinking violet. Here be throughly ripped bodices, here be wham-bam sexual mores, here be bloody intrigue and murder. And here be nailbiting jeopardy aplenty for a heroine with a considerable journey awaiting. I hear there are two more Anne books to come. Bring them on Posie! (What a great name for a writer of this genre!!!)"
4,Enjoyable historical fiction,"I am an avid historical fiction reader, so I knew that I would eventually read this book. Started out a little slow for me, but couldn't put it down after the first 100 or so pages. Characters were a little stereotypical - innocent orphan with a secret past; manipulative/conniving son of a rich merchant; soft-spoken, loving merchant's wife and the typical over-the-top courtiers and royalty. I do not consider myself to be prudish, but the graphic, S&M-type sex scenes in the beginning bordered on porn and I kept wondering why such a graphic approach was so necessary - may be offensive to some readers. Some of the text/words seemed inappropriate for the times (the constant referral to the lovers being ""hot"" or thinking another person to be ""hot"" annoyed me). Overall, I definitely enjoyed the book and recommend it. I may even attempt the sequel (it's a trilogy), but can't say that I'm rushing out to locate one."
3,Only ok,"This book isn't bad but it's not really good either. It's just a light bit of fluff. Aside from the historical inaccuracies mentioned by a previous reviewer, the main problem is that the book is predicatable and the main character is a ""Mary Sue"". She's talented, good-hearted, virtuous and irrestible to all men. Note the lack of realistic and interesting flaws. To the reader, she's just dull. But if you just want a quick romance, you could do worse."
3,Good Hair Remover,"Wow this is very nice hair removal, I can remove unwanted hair. Just turn on the electrolisys and remove my hair easily. Nice, and permanent remover."
4,I've wasted so much money going to an electrolysis!,"The only reason I give this item 4 stars is because it is not as easy as it states. However, I am so happy I bought this product. I regret spending over $200 going to an electrolysis for the past few months when this item does the exact same thing the electrolysis does but at a fraction of the price. Yeah you do have to do it yourself but if you are a money conscious person like myself, that will not matter. This was the best $40 I've ever spent but I do suggest to go to a pro first so you'll know what to expect when doing this at home."
5,Cute kid's story,"Very colorful and easy to read. My kids enjoy listening to the book, and we've read it several times."
4,"mostly easy, bright listening","I find it pleasant, very commercial but mostly fun to listen to. However, ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" is perhaps the best I've ever heard."
1,Disappointing,"This book was recommended on various web sites.The information in this book is very generic and not worth the cost. I ordered ""training you german shepherd dog"" by Dan Rice at the same time. This book costs less and is very informative."
3,The bane of my spring semester,"Although this book is very thorough when it comes to 'ion channels of excitable membranes,' it's essentially a 1000-page literature review. That's fine if you're an expert in the field (i.e. college professor), but for an undergraduate, it contained an overwhelming amount of information, including calculus-based math. Sometimes, it was helpful to consult when my class notes were incomplete. Otherwise, reading the assigned chapters in this book proved a waste of time."
1,for the brain child,I got this book for a class and never used actually used it. The book is really hard to understand and over the top. Be warned if you don't have a strong background in biophysics and other sciences this book will make no sense.
1,Interesting Background,"Consistent with the Andromeda universe, and it was interesting to learn what took place before the Andromeda Ascendent was taken out of the blackhole. However, as with all Andromeda books; far too much profanity. It's not necessary to the story line and doesn't make it more real. Show me more drama in place of the profanity."
3,Rather disappointing....,"I had high hopes for this book to fill out the background on the shows main characters, other than Dylan, but found it rather lacking. If you want to know more about Beka, Tyr and Rev. Bem, the book does a fairly good job but hardly expends any effort on Trance and Harper who have great potential for interesting story lines. In fact, there is far more expansion upon a tertiary character who is barely memorable from the first episode than for Trance and Harper put together. In addition, if you're a Trance fan, you likely won't care much for the less than flattering descriptions. Anyway, it's not a bad story but could have been a lot better."
1,It doesn't look like a Hasbro toy...,"10 Bucks for an action figure that does practically nothing, and transforming it into some kind of comet, does not make it funny...My four year child, lost interest in less than 5 minutes...I feel totally disappointed with this figure..."
3,WARNING!,"A word to the wise from one who got burned: the Artisan DVD release is the expurgated cut. The story makes no sense once they've trimmed the Jodie/Dennis sex scenes, so don't buy it. Shame on Artisan."
2,BUYERS BEWARE,"READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY. If I had taken the time to read the warning about the cut DVD version, I never would have bought this DVD. Too late schmart. It's a hatchet job. Very sad and SO maddening that an intriguing film in which one could luxuriate has been turned into a goofy trivialization. And I can't return it because I've opened it."
2,Shorter and less sexy than the VHS,The Widescreen simply cuts off the the top and bottom of the full screen VHS. Left out some of the Jodie Foster Shower scene and cut some the touchy feely between Hopper and Foster.
1,Avoid! This is NOT the Director's Cut!,"People, can you spell: M.I.S.S.E.D. O.P.P.O.R.T.U.N.I.T.Y.?Please be aware: This is not the 116 minute Director's Cut of this movie (previously released on VHS by Vestron Video), but the 99 minute version (and not 102 minutes as the description and artwork claims).I took a gamble, since the Video box artwork also states 102 minutes but was in fact 116 minutes, that this would be the proper version, but sadly it was not...You're better off trying to find the VHS version of this film as it is, even without widescreen, far superior over this version."
3,A minor disappointment,"I had seen the movie before and thought the story to be off-beat and quirky enough to be enjoyable. However, I was curious why the DVD version seemed to have been abbreviated. By my recollection, you saw a little more of Jodie Foster preparing for her shower scene, a lot more of her in lingerie in a motel room with Dennis Hopper and the original final scenes included an exchange between Fred Ward and a departing Vincent Price that is not on the DVD. Again, if my memory is correct, the apparent editing was a bit disappointing."
1,Jodie's Leg Fan's Will be Disappointed by Cut Scene's,"If your a male fan of Jodie Foster's and you saw this movie on cable, this version is a disappointment. A couple of the scene's showing her dynamite leg's were cut from this version. It's rated R, they show her topless, but they cut out the best leg scene's, go figure?"
1,This DVD is NOT Dennis Hopper's Director's Cut!!! Avoid this DVD and keep your old VHS of the Directors Cut!!!,"I usually love DVD's of old films,but this time it's not the case!!! The DVD is a butchered shorter version with a new score,YUCK!!! If you have the old director's cut on VHS tape,I advise you keep it until a Director's Cut version on DVD come out!!! I kept mine thank God!!! Great film,Bad DVD,I'm glad I did not buy it!!! THIS IS NOT DENNIS HOPPERS DIRECTOR'S CUT!!! Nuff said!!!"
2,"Be careful when buying BACKTRACK on tape, too!","This review is for anyone looking at the 1992 Director's Cut VHS of BACKTRACK.Product details indicate the tape is from VESTRON, and maybe there is such a version, HOWEVER, the tape I found today at a thrift shop has the exact cover photo as shown on the product page, with ""1992 DIRECTOR'S CUT BY DENNIS HOPPER"" printed at the bottom. Running time is listed as 102 minutes, not 116.This VHS is NOT the Vestron label, but some inferior outfit (perhaps a boot?) called AVID. It's got a generic white label on the tape and is recorded in EP mode, that is, the slowest and most inferior speed.I knew all this going in, but for a half-buck, why not?If you're looking for the full-length movie on VHS (since apparently it's not available on DVD), best to write to a seller before purchasing to verify the tape that person has runs 116 mins. and is recorded in SP mode."
4,unorthodox not just a shootem up,This is a fun and unusual film. The hitman is an intellegent professional and the development of his relationship with the target is really well done.
4,not bad.,"this movie has gotten a lot of poor reviews but i don't think it's that bad. i'm a huge jodie foster fan and while this isn't her best work, she definitely gave a solid performance. if you're a fan of hers it's def worth a watch!"
4,"Sure, Buy It.","The script is just okay, and the acting is just okay, but there is something about the gestalt of this film that has made me watch it three times.Rent it first if you have to, then buy it for your DVD library."
5,Simple blues (that's a good thing!!),"Eddie Burns is one of the last of the great Detroit bluesmen, making this 2001 recording something to cherish. Backed by a small band including his brother, bluesman Jimmy Burns on rhythm guitar, Burns turns in an excellent set of simple, straight ahead blues songs, 12 of which are originals, showing that even with age Burns can still write very fine songs. Burns alternates between guitar and harmonica, giving him an opportunity to showcase his ability on both instruments many times. He even pulls out an R&B; flavored song, the slow ""Lonely Man Plea"".Labels like Delmark need to be thanked for releasing CD's by artists who would normally be neglected. This release showed that Burns was still able to make good music, even at an old age. It also added another document of music to his small discography. Hopefully a follow-up album will come soon from this great bluesman."
2,Great Idea Poorly Made,"The idea of this little USB vacuum with LED light is a good one, but one of the locking prongs on one of the two attachments broke after just one use. This doesn't bode well for long-term durability. I wish one of the major vacuum brands would make a USB vacuum with light like this, except built to last..."
3,moderate review,"This product does not clean as well as expected. Although for the amount it cost, I guess you can not complain. It may be wise to spend a little bit more to get a better quality vacuum. I found that the vacuum has weak suction power and doesn't really seem to do any thing other then move around the dust.(which does help)"
2,Could be better!,I was really disappointed in the quality of pictures although the examples were great. It could be better!
2,Total loser,"Kellogg's has come up with the ultimate in unhealthful snack foods with these bite size sugar fixes. Sure, the graham snacks are made with whole wheat, but two of the most prominent ingredients are sugar and high fructose corn syrup. And, the ""buns"" don't taste much of cinnamon. For my grocery cart, these tidbits are ""out."""
3,Where's the bun?,"Some, of course, object to the hype of ""A good source of calcium & 4 vitamins,"" but at least the company added some nutritional value. The list of ingredients is a bit odd--some B vitamins are identified as such, some aren't. With so much fat & sugar, this product certainly isn't health food. It's not cinnamon buns either--but what can you expect from what is basically an iced cinnamon cookie? At only 50g, one will survive an occasional indulgence--convenient for lunch box, aircraft carryon, etc. The taste is pretty good, IMHO. Lots of wheat though--gluten doesn't like me much. It is nice to see a company (Kellog's) branching out--this isn't a cereal. However, many of the the cookies in my package were broken. Didn't effect the flavor, but lots of crumbs."
5,The first Modesty novel is worth the search.,"I've been slightly Modesty-obsessed for about ten years now, so I was thrilled when Amazon found me a copy of this out-of-print gem. Modesty and Willie's first caper for Sir Gerald has suspense, drama, and wit. The novel fills in details not in the comic version of this adventure, making it even more fun to read. A great addition to any pulp fiction lover's collection."
5,Modesty Blaise is one of the most delightful characters in adventure fiction.,"It is hard to say whether the Modesty Blaise novels or the Modesty Blaise comic strips are better, but the lucky reader doesn't have to choose. Read both. The comic strips have been reprinted by Titan Books, Ken Pierce Books, Manuscript Press, and in Comics Revue magazine, and now the novels are being reissued. Also highly recommended are the books Peter O'Donnell wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent."
1,Bulls-eye Warning,"The edition of Modesty Blaise with Bulls-eye in parenthesis is an adaptation by someone named Jean Nobes, in The Bulls-eye Series for Reluctant Readers. Go for the real thing, the whole thing."
5,Haven't read an awsome book lately? Then read this book!,This book the the BEST book I have read in AGES!!!! 12-year old Cassie is under alot of presure. This book is a wonderfully understandable story. Soon I bet all my friends will want to read it. I myself want to read it over and over again and never get tired of it!__ Gabriella HolmquistAtlanta
5,A Great Read for Tweens,"I am 11 years old and loved this book. Me and my friend read it at the same time and had a little book club about it. I'm sure we both agree that it's humor and great writing techniques are what makes it deserve 5 stars. I liked this book because the main character is someone you can relate to, and that it isn't suspenseful, but it's humor and real-life situations keep you turning pages. This is a great read and I highly recommend it to any tween girl that likes to laugh."
5,This is a GREAT book!!!!!,I am a 9 1/2 year old girl and I simply can't live without a good book like Just Another Day in My Insanely Real Life. I could not put the book down. The main character had the burden of keeping her family's life together. She expressed her feelings about this by writing stories in her English journal. She has a mean English teacher and her friends are not true friends. Her life gets scrambled and gushed all together at the same time. Barbara Dee writes this fantastic story of life. I can relate to it. I too write stories that help me with my feelings. I also ease my burdens by reading books like this. Two thumbs up and a hip-hip hooray for the book of the day!
4,Good,The service was good the book came in a timely manner and was in good condition. I recommend any Harriet Lerner book for both women and men. She has a lot of insight and helps you sort through and identify what your feeling.
2,Disappointed,"After reading The Dance of Anger, I was charged with energy to change patterns in relationships that I had fallen into. I thought this book would have a similar effect, because I know that I hide things that seem too painful to discuss. However, I couldn't get into it because it seemed more of a political agenda than a guide to improving relationships. What on earth does the author's stance on abortions (very pro-choice) have to do with deception in personal relationships? I haven't gotten much constructive self-knowledge out of this book."
2,Reissue lacks liner notes,"This is a review of the print on demand CD-R reissue. If printing CD-R's means that Anthony Braxton's music becomes more widely available, then I'm all for it. But the really terrible thing about this reissue is that it has no liner notes whatsoever, except for a simple track listing. Not even the names of the other musicians are listed! I would gladly pay a little more for a proper reissue with the original liner notes, or even such basic information as who actually plays on the record."
3,Good but not great,"This magnetic bottle opener opens my beer bottles very well, but it does not actually collect or store the beer cap. However, sometimes it does work ok and I continue to use it every week."
4,Pleasant and soothing,"I bought this CD a few years ago, when it was being discontinued. Fortunately, it's still available as an MP3 download.This is a very well-done acoustic instrumental album, featuring a great selection of traditional Christmas songs. Instruments used include guitar, banjo, hammer dulcimer, fiddle, an occasional oboe and melodian, and so on. All in all, it makes for a pleasant and soothing listen."
4,Tweedy's Ego Prevalent Here Too,"I am a long time fan of the band Uncle Tupelo which was fronted by Jeffy Tweedy (Wilco) and Jay Farrar (Son Volt, now doing ... solo material). That was my reason for initially watching this DVD as well as the fact that I happen to like Billy Bragg. If you are a fan of either one of them you'll love this DVD.... and unless you have no sense of the history of American music, you'll learn to appreciate Guthry as well. I particularly liked the on location stuff where they were hunting down Woody's past... a real slice of life. The most interesting part was Tweedy's personal digs on both Bragg and Farrar as collaborators..... seems there is not enough room for himself, his ego and another front man to be happily on stage at the same time....bottom line, great video."
5,If you like Game of Thrones,"You will not be disappointed by the tale of Uthred Ragnarson! A gritty tale of a boy becoming a warlord, Bernard Cornwell is both story-teller and prophet."
5,great book,great book ; this is the first one in the series ; this is such a great book ; i love this series this book caught my attention
5,The Last Kingdom(the Saxon chronicles),"I really liked this book. The history was very interesting and followed through on stuff I studied many years ago in high school. I wish he had mentioned whether Alfred's brother Aethelred was the same Aethelred who was called Aethelred the unready. It would also be very nice to have a list of the old English place names and what they are today, plus a list of the words with their modern day meaning would be very helpful."
4,Quality Historical Fiction,"To find quality historical fiction is difficult, yet Cornwell may be the best at this time. This version of Alfred the Great's victory in uniting England and saving it from the ""Lords of the North,"" i.e. the Danes, is a gripping story. As others have stated earlier, his version is not without prejudice, yet that is the flaw of historical fictions. Often the author is more important than the history. I did not feel this was the case with this book, although his depiction of much of the christian church is stereotypical, with little nuance. That being said, this book is good fun- great entertainment!"
3,I wanted to adore this....,".....but didn't quite! I was so excited to find this series of books and was so hoping I'd be overwhelmed. I did enjoy this read and have every intention of reading the next volume in the series, as well as some other Cornwell books, but I thought this could have gone deeper somehow, been more satisfying in terms of probing/developing the main character more fully. This could be absolutely magnificent with the time and setting but falls short somehow. I was a bit surprised with the close of the story -- following a gory battle with talk of a harp.....what? It just didn't seem to flow or make sense to me. Again, I'll go for the next volume and will also try ""Agincourt,"" which sounds really good. Perhaps the characters will be a bit more intriguing. This one was fun and interesting reading, so try it out if you like this sort of thing; just don't expect to be ""wow-ed!"" by it."
5,my favorite of all,"I've read almost all the Cornwell books: the Sharpe series, Civil War series, the archer, and King Arthur--only the 2 or 3 individual novels have been missed. This is my favorite so far. It is similar to the King Arthur books but with less of the mysticism and magic. The hero is a spunky boy who amuses a Viking chief during a battle and is adopted; the Norse life proves to be more suited to his taste and he grows up as a Dane. However, some old business brings him back to the English side. I won't tell more but any lover of historical fiction will find it hard to put this book down."
3,One Long Introduction,"Cornwell is one of my favorite authors, thus the 3 stars.This book, however, is not up to par for him. It is obviously setting up a trilogy (at least) but it did not have the power that his other trilogies like Vagabond / Archer's Tale / Winter King, etc. had.This seemed like one long introduction for the next book.Hey, everybody has bad days."
5,The Last Kindom,"I recieved the book in a timely manner and in the condition I expected it to be in, which is the condition the seller said it would be in. I love this series I think it paints an awesome picture of the dark ages, but I am only a novice historian."
5,interesting way of picturing Alfred,"Just loved it! Cornwells pace is amazing and he creates an interesting and rather different image of Alfred. We are used to picture this king as an incredible person, loved by everyone. But this novel presents us a different perspective, which questions the image created by Asser in his text. highly recommended!"
