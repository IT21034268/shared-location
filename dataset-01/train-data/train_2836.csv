5,City Hunter,Came quickly. Love this series. good packaging and it came very fast. Like Lee Min Ho as the City Hunter!
3,City Hunter,"I watched the drama until the end and although it was enjoyable it lacked in many areas, one of which being the main lead's acting. I felt that Lee Min Ho's acting was average and that his ""action acting skills"" (if that makes any sense) were mediocre at best."
3,"Poverty,Greed and Revenge Along the Border","I'm presuming that I viewed the same version of El Martir de Mexicali. It was distributed by Compania Oxxo, Inc. If so:Poverty and greed along the Mexican-American border are twin themes motivating and victimizing a cast of drug-addicted criminals; drug smugglers; victims of theft, assault and murder; laborers working for a criminal Patron, ""wetbacks"" abandoned by their ""coyote"" and subsequently jailed along with violent criminals. Rapid action, some violent images and adult content. Issues of power and powerlessness are addressed."
4,"Great info, needs some work on the music editing","Fantastic DVD except that the music editor should have been fired, over all the background music is too loud and in some parts quite distracting.The rest of the DVD's are fantastic and well layed out, so if you can put up with a few spots of over baring music it's a must see."
3,"Good info, shoddy workmanship","The information presented in the documentary is very good, and holds one's interest. However, the incessant soundtrack behind the narrative is repetitive, and often completely mismatched to the topic being addressed. Worse, the music is at times so loud as to entirely drown out the narrator."
2,"Decent footage, lousy sound","I would recommend saving your money and using a DVR to record better quality productions on The Military or History channels. The video footage is quite extensive, though repeated far too often during different sections. The audio portion is absolutely horrible at times; cheezy music often drowns out the narrative. The narrative is good for a basic overview of the major events (probably due to time limits), though a few silly anthropomorphized notions of ""destiny"" and ""history"" are attempted. I looked on the box for writing credits or historians and couldn't find a thing. All in all this is very mediocre, but might be a good starting point for a youngster who wants an introduction to the subject."
4,"Excellent documentary footage, but a few major problems","This dvd set has excellent documentary footage. However, the most astonishing mistake that I found was when the narrator referred to the attack on Pearl Harbor as occuring on Dec. 11!! A bit later, he says Dec. 7. Everyone makes mistakes, however a major blunder like that should have been caught. Also, it is difficult to advance it if you want to get to certain scenes. Disc 2 has some audio problems where the music (which gets too repetitious throughout) drowns out the narrator. It's just too loud. Other than that, a very good teaching tool - just don't show the part on Pearl Harbor. I guess it's back to World at War for that."
2,Not good model for Medical School Students,"I purchased this model in the hope that I might be able to learn the details of the skull but it was not a very accurate model. Much of the foramen were sealed off and the fine details of the pt and it fossas were not clear. I did not return this item because returning it was an involved process of getting your return approved so I did not want to waste my time but if you intend to purchase this skull and you are in an md, pa or nursing program do not waste your money. An atlas would be a better resource than this skull. But it will come in handy during halloween!"
3,Tolstoy's last days,"This is the story of the last days of Leo Tolstoy, writer and fervent egalitarian who was beloved by the Russian people. A young man (James McAvoy) is hired to be Tolstoy's secretary and finds himself witness to heated arguments between the great man and his wife (Helen Mirren). Tolstoy wants to rid himself of all his possessions and leave his copyrights to the people while his wife wants her children to inherit his estate.Since I haven't read Tolstoy's works and was unfamiliar with his philosophy, the movie failed to engage me despite powerful performances by both Plummer and Mirren. The script assumes the audience is familiar with Tolstoy's greatness, but I didn't know why he was worshipped by his followers, other than he wanted a better life for his countrymen. This is strictly a domestic drama with McAvoy's bland and boring character getting the most screen time. ""The Last Station"" features outstanding acting by its two stars but the story is flawed, in my opinion."
2,The Last Station,This movie was very hard to follow along. It didn't make sence at all.Its more of a love story if any thing.
3,"Great idea, rather dull execution","I really wanted to like this movie, and it was a decent way to pass the time, but the story goes nowhere fast. You have all the elements, the colossal literary figure, his Rasputin like manager, his disenchanted wife, and a pair of young lovers paralleling the conflicts of the elders. However, the story is just a series of fights, then make-ups, then another conflict, then make-ups. Everyone acts like naive babies throughout the movie and the histronics get tiresome after awhile. I would have liked more interjections about Tolstoyan philosophy or deeper dialogue. Flat screenplay."
2,A Story Without a Soul,"Sidney Lumet said the first thing he asked before making a movie was: What is the story?The story of The Last Station is about Tolstoy's torn between his political/philosophy beliefand his family, namely his wife.Despite a good cast, the film fails to convey Tolstoy as a person being manipulated by hisfollowers and his true feelings about his family.Helen Mirren made a good effort. Christopher Plummer may be a wrong casting choice.The only actor that managed to convey any true emotion was James McAvoy.This is a story lacking its soul and the filmmakers failed to identify/convey this key element thatmakes a good drama."
3,The last days of a great love,Most movie love stories show the origin of what we expect will be a great love. This movie shows us the last days of a great love. By turns uplifting and heartbreaking. A movie that feeds your soul. (Plus a bonus story of budding love if you really can't live without that.)
5,Wonderfully Done,"This story tells of a novelist and his strong willed but devoted wife. It also reveals his influence on others in their beliefs and efforts. However along the way the main character embarks upon a decision which threatens to change his lifestyle, his family's and that of his devoted followers. The tale is told in a manner which mirrors the relationship of the writer with his wife and a much younger and inexperienced devotee in a blooming romance. It exposes concepts, understanding and behavior which centers around the differences and similarities within the relationships of the younger and the older. Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren were simply devine in their delivery."
4,Turbo version much better than the regular version,"There are 2 great songs on this single, as a reviewer said earlier the song Pick Up the Pieces is a gentle song with Ben great on vocals and Olly brilliant in the background with his jazzy drumming.The Turbo Version of Whippin Picadilly has another layer onto the back part of the song where the drums kick in on the regular version. This makes it sound smoother and a bit heavier.Pussyfootin is the other song here, nothing special, very similar in feel to another b side Emergency Surgery with an almost middle eastrn style guitar over jazz style drumming.All of these can be found on Five Men in a Hut, so only worth getting if you like singles.Note: even though the title listing says #1, there is only 1 cd."
1,Just straight rote learning...,"...page after page of word lists; instructions basically are to practice writing and spelling the words until they are learned...I see NOTHING ""natural"" about the method...great ONLY if you want the child bored and miserable while learning to spell...however, many more useful, interesting and fun alternatives exist...recommend Steck-Vaughn's ""Spelling -- Linking Words to Meaning"" as well as the ""Word Wisdom"" series from Zane-Blosser."
1,Just a book of word lists,"This book has nothing ""natural"" about it. It's just a book of word lists for each grade. Conveniently they leave that out of the preview online. These same word lists can be looked up online for free. Can't believe I spent $30 on word lists. The ""ideas"" for learning the words are weak at best. Save your money and search Google for words."
5,Great Book!! Check it out!!,this is a great book!! I have tried other spelling books but this one covered alot!! if you are thinking about getting a spelling book this is the one to get!!
2,Did not use,Too skimpy. We did not use this. There was just not enough for the $$$ either. Basically just word lists. We are currently using A Reason for Spelling which my 2nd graders and my 5th grader enjoy. A Reason for Spelling is much more worth the money and the children seem to enjoy it more.
3,"A Lot Of Info, But Not Enough Structure","This book is small (not very thick) and contains a lot of information, however, it became too much work for me. It has things broken down into various categories and activities, lists, etc., but all that did for me was cause a lot of work flipping all over the book and checking to make sure I am covering everything. I used it for 3 months and decided that I needed something a little more structured and laid out.I am a big fan of the Charlotte Mason approach, but w/ that philosophy there is a lot of flexibility and sometimes I need a more direct approach to certain activities. I do agree that if the child spells the word incorrectly, you have them correct it immediately and then that is a word they need to study. However, having a curriculum that is laid out step by step, making sure I am covering all of the different words, rules, etc, is what I need and this is not it."
3,Wasn't really what I thought it was,"I ordered a book, and recieved a type written stack of papers and a report cover to put them in. Disappointed."
3,Great,"Book arrived in great condition, am om great time and was what I expected. Each section goes by grade level and words are in alphabetical order. It has English rules and much more."
2,too much work,"I was initially interested in The Natural Speller because it was recommended in A Charlotte Mason curriculum book I read. I did not like it b/c I had to plan the curriculum. I just wanted something easy that I could quickly go through. I couldn't figure how to keep the word lists organized and do pretests/final tests on the words we were studying for that week. If I had given the book a chance and perhaps started out with it, I may have stuck with it. I went back to Spelling Workout. There is no planning there!"
5,Great for Frugal Homeschooling!,"Here is another wonderful resource for frugal homeschoolers. This book teaches how to teach spelling, teaches children how to study spelling words, has suggestions for advanced and struggling spellers, and has lists all the way from 1st to 8th grades, with Greek, Latin, and French roots included. It is a great, affordable, easy to use resource. I think this will get more and more popular as homeschoolers spread the word."
3,Poingnant look at baby boomers heading west,"There are a few tracks that make this CD worth the money. ""Ever Present Past"" is one which, despite its peppy up-beat pop feel is a poingnant look at what it is to be a human nearing the end of what now looks like an awfully short turn. ""You Tell Me"" is another interesting look at the past, memory and perception. And you have to admit the title of the collection is brilliant in this age of full disks meaning the end of a computers life.""Dance Tonight"" is a catchy little ditty that isn't anything special except that in context Paul seems to be saying - ""Hey folks - let's just dance, after all that's all there is.""The rest of the tracks? They run from sappy to maudlin, kinda like life - a bunch of stuff you sit through to get to the good stuff."
2,Where is the real Paul,"This was very disappointing to me, it was like McCartney that I knew and listened to from the beginning, has been consumed by heartbreak and grief. I hope this CD is not the last he will make in his over the top career."
2,Disappointed,"This album was a huge disappointment - I'm a big fan of McCartney's, but this is really bad. Sorry."
2,Mediocre McCartney,"Let me preface this review with a profession of my undying respect and love for Paul McCartney's music. I feel as though he has written some of the best pop songs in music history, this collection however, holds none of them.Lyrically, Memory Almost Full is perhaps McCartney's worst. He's always been considered a bit ""cheesy"", but this record is beyond that. It's almost as if he played a game of Mad Libs to find song titles, and used a rhyming dictionary to fill in the lyrics.Musically, this album meets McCartney's standards. Some very interesting arrangements, melodies, and bass lines in this one.Sadly, without a Lennon or Costello to help sift through his lyrics to find the hidden gems, this one falls flat."
3,Not as fabulous as I had hoped.,"I was really expecting to be wowed by this CD but I wasn't. Many of the songs sounded similar to Paul's CD ""Driving Rain"". Lyrically Paul seemsintrospective but musically he sounded the same from song to song. For a man that has been in the music industry for 50 years, I think he was resting on his laurels instead of creating new music."
2,"The Great Album Was ""Chaos and Creation"", Not This","I'm so puzzled by the praise for this album. It's a muddled collection, with perhaps 2 really good songs (EVER PRESENT PAST and SEE YOUR SUNSHINE) but mostly songs that bore and have that cringe-able feeling McCartney too often evokes. If you want a really good listening experience that will last over repeated listening go to McCartney's last album ""Chaos and Creation In The Backyard."" That was a true return to form! It must have been Nigel Goodrich and his getting McCartney to edit himself (does this sound familiar -- Lennon, Costello?). MEMORY ALMOST FULL is a recording I won't be returning to like MCCARTNEY, BAND ON THE RUN, and CHAOS AND CREATION - the only 3 McCartney solo albums I truly love and consider worthy of attention."
1,Disappointed,I am a huge Beatles / Wings / McCartney fan but I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was in this CD. Is Paul over the musical hill? Did his failed marriage put him in a dark place? Does he overestimate his musical ability because he's Paul McCartney? I'm amazed that he put out a CD that shouldn't even be considered in the same breath with his other works. I know he doesn't need the money. Then why?
1,Don't Bother,"I am the biggest Beatles fan of all the 50 somethings I know. I have seen McCartney solo many times. This disc is the biggest disappointment of all the ex-Beatles solo efforts, bar none."
1,PAUL IS DONE,"i'm a big fan of paul and especially the beatles, but i didnt like this cd. paul is running on fumes...and his classical stuff is pedestrian at best."
3,Vintage Paul - Terrible mastering,"I agree with the other reviewers who say this CD was compressed TOO LOUD!!! It's virtually un-listen-able. That's minus one star. Has the music industry gone loudness mad? It sounds like there's some good songs here, especially tracks 8 thru 13. A great second half, but tracks 6 and 7 hurt the album a bit, so that's minus another star. Finally, the packaging could have dropped it another star, but I base my ratings on the music and sound quality, nothing more. But telling us to go to the computer for the rest of the lyrics, is just lame. Either print the lyrics or don`t, but not 2 songs worth."
2,"Adolescent and Dull, Nearly Tuneless Drivel...","At 64, Paul's charm may be that his songs are still geared for the advanced high school set. But one might think, growing up might be in order, even for a billionaire legend. All these tunes are at best embarrassing, at worst just plain drivel. Obviously, ""Rock Music"" is for the young, and maybe is meant to be practically stillborn beyond about a college age listener. All the ""legends"" of rock, those pushing or over 60, appear stuck in their adolescent schtick, perhaps understandable since that's when they made their fame and fortune. Compared with the titans of an earlier age, like say Sinatra or Bennett, Paul's elder recording years present a serious case of arrested development,especially in this recent atttempt. If only all the world could be young again!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"I have been a fan of Paul's for a long time and looked forward to new material from him. I was very disappointed with this new CD, however, as it was very mediocre to say the least. I expected far more from a person I consider very talented. Maybe it is time for him to retire. This is a two-CD set but the second CD is mostly him talking about how he wrote the songs. I bought the CD for music, not to listen to Paul talk. This stuff could have been printed on the insert accompanying the CD. This material is definitely not his best work by any stretch of the imagination."
2,No Chaos,"I loved Choas but really dislike this CD. Why does he put out stuff like this? I realize that Choas didn't sell well and he's put out a full scale effort to make this one sell. But you need something to sell and this isn't it. The first two songs are okay but the rest is almost unlistenable. Chaos showed that he still has something left in him -- that with the right people around him, he can still make quality music. But this is harkens back to the bad old days. I liked the reviewer who said that Choas showed the McCartney in Lennon/McCartney. Now we'll have to wait another 2 or 3 or 4 years before we get another chance for something good."
1,I can't dance to this music(?).,"It's hard to believe this is the man who wrote ""Here, there and everywhere"", ""Elenor Rigby"", ""Things we said today"" and all those gems back in the 60's. I've been a huge fan of Paul and the Beatles for over 30 years, but I must say this album is really, really bad. According to some reviewers, those who don't like it are fools. I must be one of those fools. Frankly, I could find nothing positive in any of these songs. Music is bad, his singing isn't what it used to be, and his playing of different instruments is amateurish at best. Almost all his solo albums have disappointed me so far, that is for the past 30 years! I think he should have retired long ago or should have stuck to his good old tunes just to please fans. I don't think he has ""it"" anymore."
4,A solid effort,"I'm not going to over analyze. Do I generally like the CD? Yes. Are there at least a few songs I like? Yes. Will I play it again? Yes.It seems most negative reviewers make the mistake of comparing this album to past works. Comparing this to Ram, or something 30+ years old is silly. This is not, and is not meant to be, the same. The one comparison I'll make is I do like this better than Chaos and Creation. Word is Paul began this album after Driving Rain, but put it on hold to do Chaos. This does seem like a successor to Driving Rain. So I'd say if you liked that CD a little, you'll find a few things on here you'll like. If you did not like Chaos that much, give this one a chance- the songs are much more catchy and memorable than most of Chaos. Do not expect the successor to Chaos, and for Pete's sake, do not expect this to sound like Band on the run!As I said, a solid effort worth repeated plays that I'm glad I purchased."
5,Just be Grateful.,I was listening to this and thinking how lucky we are to still have Paul making great music still. Enjoy and don't over analyze. It is music!
4,I Still Love Paul,I loved that first song the best. The whole album felt as if I were holding hands with a boyfriend of long ago that I had missed.
4,"""Gratitude"" is Worth the Price of Admission","Paul's new offering is actually pretty good, but there is almost nothing eternally inspirational in Memory Almost Full (except for the song I will discuss further on). There is no point in comparing what Paul does now with Wings of the 70's, let alone the Beatles. Artists like Paul who go out and take a legitimate shot at a solo career usually don't come close to the earlier greatness; and for obvious reasons: Paul needed John, George, and Ringo as each of them needed Paul and each other to make their music special.Ever Present Past is a real catchy track, and Paul's bass playing has always been outstanding. Evidence: listen to the bass lines on 'Gratitude' and you will understand. He has such a unique melodic bass playing style. That track is worth the price of admission."
5,Old School McCartney,"Over the last 10 years McCartney has been going through a renaissance of sorts. I'm not sure if this culminates it or not, but this effort certainly does keep the momentum going. Excellent, excellent album from start to finish.Highlights? There are many. The opener ""Dance Tonight"" is fun, especially with the mandolin rhythm. Or there's ""Only Mama Knows"" a clear ode to his first wife Linda. And then of course, there is the suite of songs that finish the album. However, I think my favorite is ""Gratitude"". Here McCartney pulls out his rocker voice (ala Sgt. Pepper, Oh Darling, Back in the U.S.S.R.) and delivers one of his best vocals in the last 20 years.Absolutely worth purchasing (especially if it's on sale.) McCartney's ""memory almost full"" is a tour de force that will rank as one of his best solo albums ever. (And that's saying a lot considering what he's accomplished in his brilliant career.)"
2,"Very, VERY disappointed","I consider myself one of Sir Paul's staunchest champions - my career started because of the inspiration that he and the other Beatles brought to me when I was a very young boy. I have also defended him to those who would discount his abilities in comparison to Lennon's. Quite simply, I believe McCartney to be the greatest melodicist of the last fifty years. That being said, I regret purchasing this CD.""Chaos and Creation...,"" Paul's 2005 release, featured some of the best work of recent years. As I read reviews of ""Memory Almost Full,"" I thought, ""He's DONE it - he's made a complete return to greatness!"" Not so. I find the lyrics he wrote for this disc to be as insipid as his worst critics have always stated. If not for the richness of McCartney's voice and the consistency of his bass playing, ""Memory"" would be no better than the newest releases by any one of the countless, disposable artists of the day. A true shame."
1,The End Indeed,"I'm a long time fan of the Beatles and the sporadic excellent solo work the fab four have produced so I'm predisposed to enjoy the ""sound"" when I hear it. Not so the case here. This album has one good song, the first track. And it's only mildly entertaining. The rest of this album is weak, self-indulgent drivel. McCartney's penchant for finding a sound or noise he likes and repeated ad nauseum is well represented here. In place of verses, he'll just whistle or ooo until your reaching for the FF button. I got this CD second hand and, at $3, I don't feel I got my money's worth. This will be my last Paul McCartney album. For the sake of his legacy, I hope it's his as well. Time to hang it up, Paul. Thanks for the memories, which were full about 15 years ago."
2,Disappointing,I was really excited to get my hands on this CD -- even paid the Starbuck's price!!!! Not worth it. And I am a hardcore Beatle-McCartney fan. Nothing really new or exciting or reminiscent here. Sad.
2,Painful boredom,"It's tough to be a Macca fan for 45 years and wind up with this bland, boring, lifeless creation. His youthful exuberance and wonder are sorely missing (which is understandable but hard to accept) and who can sing any of these songs, which was always his trademark? Marrying Heather and making this record are two monumental mistakes you can't take back..."
3,"Memory There, Music Almost","This is a very very good effort. But as a Beatles fan since the beginning, as much as I want to hear new ""Beatles Music"" and visit those days, they are gone. Memory There, Music Almost. The best song hands down on this CD is the Wings sounding House of Wax. The CD is worth the price for that song alone. Two catchy songs See Your Sunshine and Vintage Cloths - classic McCartney melody with ok lyrics. Paul is definitly on the right path, maybe if he adds Ringo's drums..."
5,Renaissance,"Let the renaissance begin, but in my opinion it already started with Flaming Pie. Can't wait for the next album!"
3,vocals and instruments best in years,"Pauls vocals and instruments are the best I've heard in years however the music is average at best. As I listen to the music, I think it's real good at times and at other times I listen more critically and think that Paul has lost his touch for creating great memorable tunes."
2,You might like this album when you're 64,"Paul has run out of good ideas. If anybody else had released this, itwould already be in the cut out bin. Only for aging hippieswho saw The Beatles on Ed Sullivan and claim the fire is still alive.Paul is indeed dead."
1,I think Heather made our Paul nutty..it's all over this disc,"I fear Paul's divorce from Heather afflicted his emotional and musical senses... I agree with another reviewer who said it was Paul's worst outing since McCartney II.The only halfway listenable song is ""Dance Tonight"", then it's straight down the musical slope from there. If anything, recording this album gave McCartney an opportunity to stay busy during a very dark chapter of his life. I recently sold my copy at a garage sale for $3.oo."
1,This album sucks,"Geezer lyrics stupid ""melodies"" boring musical back up... Simply put, If Paul Macartney's name wasn't on this CD, American idol wouldn't even let him try out...don't waste you time or money..."
3,Bash My Head Against This Wall Of Sound,"There may be a couple of good songs here. Hard to tell. The CD is so freakin' compressed and smashed for loudness sake that it is virtually unlistenable (for me). Two dimensional and flat as a board. Abrasive and shrill -the loudest CD I've yet heard - even over super-compressed rock bands.Paul should know better. What does he have to prove? Sensitive songs beaten to a pulp, trite ditties - opening and closing the CD - a waste of time and talent.Macca ruled as Beatle. The Beatle is hereby Squashed."
1,Memory Almost Full,This had to be the absolute worst thing I have ever listened to. No only should Paul McCartney not sing anymore...I am thinking he shouldn't even write songs.I listened to the CD once and tried to GIVE IT AWAY...and nobody even wants it...I am so sorry I wasted my hard earned money on it.Donna M. Arnone
1,Memory Almost Full... Creativity almost empty!,"Expecting to get a better CD than ""Chaos and Creation..."", bought this CD in a Starbucks location in Lima, Peru for TWENTY BUCKS!... Are they crazy???!!!Even when the CD edition and audio quality are superb... What did McCartney tried to do on this album?... Still a 'Beatlesque' creature?... Some ""WINGSish"" thing?... Taking some excerpts from his superb Liverpool Oratorio?... The whole album is a collage of different chords and beats, that make a worthless whole thing!Just in case, if any of your Wings-era CDs is seriosuly damaged, you better spend your money on replacing it! Don't spend your valuable money on this CD!"
4,bigtime Paul fan,"You couldn't find a bigger Paul fan than myself and my family. That said, we were somewhat disappointed with this CD. But I have had that experience in the past and found that it is just because he once again has enhanced his music so that it is not always the same old Paul. I'm certain that, as with Chaos and Creation, it will soon grow on me and become a favorite. When you are speaking of the greatest composer of music in our time, whom we are fortunate enough to have in our midst, it's probably not wise to pass too quick a judgement. I've found at these times, with Paul, that it's usually just because he had grown past me in his vision and I have yet to have caught up."
3,The End of the End?,"Look, I like Paul McCartney just as much as the next guy. But he needs, in the parlance of the publishing world, a better ""editor."" Sure, there are some good songs here -- ""The End of the End,"" ""Ever Present Past,"" and ""Dance Tonight"" -- but there are a few duds.This CD is probably on par with Chaos and Creation (although I'm not positive) but it doesn't have anything as memorable as, say, a couple of the songs on McCartney II (such as ""Waterfalls"" and ""Summer's Day Song"")."
3,Nothing like Beatles or Wings,"I haven't listen to too much Paul McCartney stuff of late. I just remember him for Beatles and Wings music which I like. So I'm somewhat disapointed to this new album since it doesn't sound that much like Beatles or Wings. Maybe I need to listen to it more times before I am reminded of those early signature sounds. I'm guessing most of Paul McCartney's newer stuff doesn't sound like Beatles. So if you like the newer stuff, there's no reason to be disappointed here. I do like the first song, but because I'm familiar to it, hearing it on TV."
2,Not very good considering McCartney's talent.,Not a very good effort by McCartney. The songs are uninspired and sales are likely driven by McCartney's fame. Flaming Pie was much better.
4,Edgy and delightful,"The last few McCartney CD's have left me wanting less ""boppy"", syrupy music. As a Beatles fanatic, I was surprised at my reaction to previous Paul McCartney endeavors. But this CD surprised and delighted me! It's edgy enough to keep my attention, but still maintains his wonderful ability to craft a tune that we can sing along with. I would highly recommend this album."
5,Wistful and wonderful.,"""End Of The End"" is one of the great McCartney songs of all time, and although there are a few ""what-is-he-thinking"" moments, this is a brilliant artistic success, even better than ""Chaos"" and certainly light years ahead of ""Driving Rain, ""Press To Play"" and the erraticl ""McCartney II."" The harmonies are excellent, the lyrics are fine (though I could do without the ""very, very, very, very"" line in ""Feet In The Clouds"") and Paul's voice shows a range that is truyly amazing. The two singles and ""Vintage Clothes"" are bright and upbeat, ""Only Mama Knows"" pulsates and ""Mr. Bellamy"" is a quirky delight. Thanks, Paul."
4,Some excellent songs,"Like often with McCartney, the music on this album is filled with great melodies, hooks and playfulness. Unfortunately, David Kahne was hired for production (he also did ""Driving Rain""), resulting in a mixed bag of quality in the songs..Highlights: ""You tell me"" is a classic track Paul could have composed 40 years ago, ""Only mama knows"" is nicely bass-driven (that sounds live better), the guitar-layered ""That was me"", and the original ""Mr bellamy"".The rest of the album is not bad at all and is full of great ideas but Paul is so much better when he has a true sparring partner. Nigel Godrich (producer of ""Chaos and Creation"") would not approve to some songs, Youth (of ""The Fireman"") would have improved a lot.. Even better would be an album with Elvis Costello, David Grohl (or Keith Richards?!)."
3,"Great Melodies, Disappointing Lyrics","In term of melody, this is one of McCartney's finer solo efforts in many years. It seems like he really tried to shape the music well, and the effort has paid off in that respect. However, the lyrics are quite distracting in that they don't feel at all genuine. I love the title of this album, but the content of the tracks do not match that title. His ""silly love songs"" here sound like they could have been written by a teenager. They do not sound like the heartfelt thoughts of any man who has been through the personal triumphs and tragedies inevitable if one spends 6 decades on the planet."
2,Bleah.,"When Paul released ""Chaos and Creation in the Backyard"" a few years ago, he mentioned that there were a few songs that the producer of that album, Nigel Godrich, didn't particularly care for.I am more than willing to bet that some of those songs ended up on this album.There are a couple of decent tunes here. ""Dance Tonight"" and ""Ever Present Past"" are catchy. Most of the rest are forgettable, and two in particular, ""Gratitude"" and ""Nod Your Head,"" are regrettable.This album contained nowhere near the spirit, inspiration, and just plain good music that ""Chaos"" had. I hope that Paul will collaborate with Godrich again on his next endeavor."
3,McCartney's sequel to Chaos and Creation,"Having listened to this about a dozen times, I've realized that McCartney, on each LP, is capable of writing about four to five very good songs, as he did with Lennon and Harrison. Most of the time, however, he has difficulty filling an entire LP with quality work. The first four tracks are quite enjoyable and so are a couple of others. ""Ever-present Past"" is the one catching my ear most convincingly, and seems a natural single (if this can get any air play). Overall, nice effort from the ""cute"" Beatle."
2,Sorry tried to like it....,"I have to say that his voice was not very good and the songs were dissapointing. Sorry, and I liked his music when he was with the Beatles."
2,"Worst since ""McCartney II""....should have been shelved..","Don't get me wrong ...i LOVE Paul and his music. Sir Paul claimed in a recent interview that his old record company ""ran out of ideas"" ...well after 2 listens...I think he can join them. This is as disjointed as ""McCartney II"" was..and that stunk. I think Paul should have kept working but must feel that everything he spits out deserves wide attention. Even when Paul isn't working at Elvis Costello level ""word wise"" he is always good for catchy melodies but even that has eluded him here. I wanted to like this record very much and paid a premium price for it AND The double disc version.I guess the good news is ....he always follows stinkers with a surprisingly terrific next record...here's waiting for that."
1,rip off,"I not only was ""painfully bored"" but felt terribly ripped off! Sir Paul was probably in need of some fast cash to pay off Heather is the only thing I can think off that would make him put this one together. Sorry, but I normally love everything he does but this one really fell flat."
1,Did not meet expectations.,Hopefully this is not the last recording he ever does because this is easily his worst.
5,One of his best,"This is definitely his best in a while and one of the top 3 for me. Great job, Paul!"
4,good after engine cleaning,"After using simple green on my engine I used this. gives a nice coating and shine. I wouldn't lay it on too thick, I would do a couple of light coats after letting it dry. I was happy with the results."
3,Item info,"Leontyne Price, Franco Corelli, RObert Merril, Mirella Freni, Herbert von karajan, Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna State Opera CHorus, Vienna Boys Choir. RCA label, 1964, 1971. Three cassette tapes in original color box, includes large booklet 44 pg. booklet with words to opera parts."
4,"Excellent, although old recording!","Played by David Saperton, son-in-law of Leopold Godowsky, these recordings give an insight into the masterpieces of Godowsky as few have done even now. Especially good to hear is the Symphonic Metamorphoses of the Strauss waltzes. The quality of play on these pieces is better than both Earl Wild and Rian de Waal. The album is worth buying for both its historical value (Saperton was a teacher of Abbey Simon and Jorge Bolet), as well as the excellent performance of the Godowsky works."
1,Poor Redo,"Old time favorite poorly redone; almost depressing looking at us older folk; video quality less than fair, no closed caption; but the original."
3,"Cheep, but okay","It surprisingly good quality for the price. The packaging that it ships in is not so good though. The wood on the small sword what dented and looked like the one of the other swords had smacked it hard. The wood on the large sword was in good shape, but the dragon was not fully painted in, and the tie down part on the scabbard was broken. I was able to fix it with wood glue. They are going to be hanging in my spare bedroom next to a mortal kombat arcade box. It is a nice decorative piece, but you get what you pay for, I don't think I would trust swinging them around for fear the blades would fly out of the handle."
2,there alright,"Bought these for my Husband, They are pretty but the holders and the stand are cheaply made and the knives themselves are extremely dull. My husband likes them because we can easily buy a sharpening set and a new stand BUT we shouldn't have to be. NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU CAN BUY THE EXTRAS."
2,counterfit,I usually purchase this product from a spa but found it online for less. Once I received the product I began using it. The product was not of the same consistency as it should be. I noticed it stung my face. The next day I developed a sandpaper like rash all over the lower half of my face. I believe it was either expired or tampered with in some way.
4,D&D is killer!,"D&D is killer. It is the only cd I've listened to for the last three weeks. Every song is pure Nora but none of the songs sound alike. ""The Goddam Champion"" is one the heaviest songs I've ever heard. I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,GREAT SMALL TOWN CHARM,ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK! GREAT HOLIDAY READ AND GREAT CHARACTERS! CAN'T WAIT TO READ MORE OF THIS SERIES.
3,nice,"probably haven't given this CD enough spins yet to make a fair review, just doesn't catch my attentionBut, if you like a lot of rapping and little to no catchy hooks this is for you"
3,book review,I primarily got this book because of the line drawings. I use these for patterns for woodcarving and wood burning. The images in this book worked very well for that purpose.
3,Am I getting old? Anyone else notice all the sex?,"I have some catching up to do. Although I have read an abundance of sci-fi over the years I was not quite ready for the amount of sex in this book nor the continuous use of the ""f---"" word. I don't know how I would feel if this book were to be read by someone in their early teens (just how old should you be to read about someone watching their grandmother doing it with a slave? Although the 3-way encounter was handled more lovingly.) Did I continue reading because it was a fine example of literature or because I was curious to find out how the next few pages might surprise me? As for fantasy sci-fi, this book has a wonderful, dreamlike quality (wet dream?). Prehaps Amazon should cross-reference this book under ""erotica"", or at least include a sentence in their capsule review about the sexual content. Prehaps I'm just behind the times - it should be interesting to catch up on the last 5 years of science fiction."
2,"A twisty, ungrounded novel","The first chapter of this book is intriguing, raising questions about the nature of the protagonist and the odd world she lives in. Unfortunately, this is the only interesting part of the novel. Once the protagonist (I cannot name her, because she really has no official name) begins her journey, all I can find in this book is unecessarily harsh language that does not serve the plot, bizarre voice changes that force me to flip around to figure who is talking, and a style of prose that is beautiful in some spots but tacky in most. Unfortunately, such things seem characteristic of ""literary"" sci-fi, which is what this novel claims to be.I detect promise in Candas Jane Dorsey, but only if Ms. Dorsey promises that her next novel will make sense, literary or not."
3,"Interesting setting and characters, but for what?","This fantasy work of Dorsey's involves a unique and interesting setting and distinct characters, but after finishing the book I truly had no idea what the book was trying to say. I suppose the work could be taken as a celebration of the bonds between sisters and between daughters and mothers, but outside of that ""Black Wine"" really doesn't have anything to prove. Although I wouldn't tout the author's language as anything worthy of instant attention, I felt her use of words did well to build the mysterious, dark mood of much of the novel, and it is on this that I give the book 3 stars. There were quite a few graphic sex scenes, and numerous simply inexplicable sexual references (was I the only one who thought the mention of ""handprints"" was just kind of silly?), so those with easily-offended morals would best avoid this book."
5,Best fantasy of decade,"I note a recommendation for fans of LeGuin and the like above. Well, I'm not a big LeGuin fan (I read the Earthsea trilogy in high school), and I loathe Atwood, but I loved this book.Recommendation? Read it. It's amazing. The only fantasy from the '90s that I can think of that compares at all is Brust's Agyar, which is written by one of the best, and most definitely is not a first novel. Out of first novels, this book stands out.I hope she writes more. All I can say is, The Hobbit was a first novel, and this book is too."
1,Get it from the Library first,"My son (22mo) picked out this book from the Library due to the bright colors and illustrations. The first time we sat down to read it, we didn't finish it as he very quickly lost interest and I was so annoyed with all the ""teeny tiny""! Imagine every sentence in the book having ""teeny tiny"" in it! The second time we sat down to read it, I took out all the ""teeny tiny"" parts and we made it all the way through. The story has nothing to do with a teacher. The plot goes like this... the teacher and the kids go on a walk to the park, the teacher finds a bone and puts it in her pocket, they return to school for a snack and a ghost proceeds to yell, ""give me my bone"", the story ends with the teacher yelling, ""take it"". Very boring and a bit morbid for us. I would get it from the library first and if your child loves it, then buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your money...you will be sorely dissapointed."
2,"Too Much ""Teeny Tiny""","The illustrations are really great, which is the only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one. Nearly every noun in the book is preceeded by ""teeny tiny"". It is really annoying to read and also distracting from the plot. But then the plot leaves me with a great big ""huh?"". There are teeny tiny kids who go to a teeny tiny school and are taught be a teeny tiny teacher. (Ok, I'll drop the ""teeny tiny's"" from here on out.) They go for a walk and find a bone and bring it back to class. Then they hear a voice asking to give the bone back. The teacher tells the voice to take it and a ghost comes out of the closet and takes it. That's a very odd plot if you ask me."
5,Advancing through connection,"I've amassed a large library of martial arts books and video materials over the years. In ""Purple Belt Requirements"" Roy Dean continues his description of the BJJ journey relating his own experiences. He demonstrates the importance of being able to link techniques to advance your BJJ game, and most importantly the mental aspect of ""What makes a purple belt"". The techniques and philosophies in this dvd is helping me on my own path to purple belt in my bjj school. This is definitely a great addition to my personal martial arts library, and I look forward to the upcoming ""No-Gi"" dvd that's coming out."
3,Classical pieces played throughout the century,"This CD does contain recordings which were recorded as far back as the 1920's, so expect some of them to be rather poor in quality by todays standards. The performing artist's renditions of these difficult pieces are outstanding. A brief history of the Rhapsodies and the recordings are included."
4,"a gift, indeed!","mr. newman came to prominence back in the 60s as a leader in the soul jazz trend with players like brother jack mcduff, etc., and he still has that soulful fire some thirty years later. this album features him on flute, tenor, and alto sax and has a fine supporting cast of players. with age, mr. newman has mellowed to a degree and sounds a bit more boppish than on some of his early records on atlantic ( a key reissue to explore is ""that's mr. fathead"" on 32 jazz). this set swings from the outset and mr. newman provides excellent work on flute. listen for the ballads--here is where the sweet soul still shines through, evoking a warm night, candlelight, and the person you love. get this album, you will enjoy a session by seasoned master."
4,Great music,"The songs are good, played by excellent musicians. However, I like her last CD more than this one."
3,Its alright,"The series is alright. The first season was pretty bad but it got better as it went on. Nothing beats the original 90's series but hey that series is over and we need something else to watch. The series is good but could be alot better but it can also be alot worse. So watch at your own risk , you will either hate it or like it."
4,nice to get them all at once in a first season pack,nice price and nice to get all of one in one order toobad it wasn't packaged like season 3 and they need season 4 the fight with apocolips it was only a few episodes long.
4,New vs old,"I loved the 90's Fox series. That being said, that show was awful. If I got the chance I would buy a box set, but the show was pretty bad. I suppose it's possible that in another ten years I'll look at X-Men Evolution and think it's no good, but for now I'll have to give it a thumbs up. I can understand some fans not liking Evolution because it messes with the story so much, Cyclops in Highschool, while Storm is an adult woman, with Multiple man at about 13 or 14. But if you think you can get past it, or if that doesn't bother you at all, I can promise you, it's worth it."
2,Not for all xmen fans,Nowhere near as good as the origonal animated series that was on fox in the 90's. Way too childish and all around lame.
4,This is where it starts,"This is a great set for a great price. You should get the whole series, but this is the begining. From the first to last episode everything in season one is so fresh and new."
1,Way overpriced,I have one of these. It's probably worth about five to ten bucks. Find a better price elsewhere.
3,My thoughts..,"I've been doing Tabata workouts for approx. 8 months now and was excited to find a new one on the market. This one will definitely make you work and sweat but..Pros: - gets the heart pumping and the legs burning- instructor is upbeat(but not annoying) w/ good cueingCons: - rather boring, can't imagine doing it more than oncea week- very little upper body work, not full body as claimsBottom line, I would strongly recommend Supreme 90 days Tabata workout over this one, but still better than Amy Dixon's. I'll continue using it on occasion until something better comes along."
1,Strongest Recommendation to Avoid.,"I unfortunately had to buy this book as a textbook for my political science class as I attend a Catholic college. Mr. Krason's intolerant views such as criticizing the decriminalization of homosexuality, and basically advocating a theocracy based entirely on what he calls ""papal teachings"" goes against the basic American ideals of separation of church and state, freedom and tolerance. This kind of thinking is in the tradition of Jerry Falwell. I encourage all to avoid this book. Taking a look at this man's picture on the back cover is scary enough to avoid this title."
4,"Chulaholma, MI April 93&#65533;...the blues spirits were smilin&#65533;.","If the original members of Black Sabbath had grown up deep in the Delta swamps, cutting their musical teeth on the slide guitar wizardry of Fred McDowell they might have sounded something like Junior Kimbrough & the Soul Blues Boys. This collection culled from live performances at Kimbrough's Juke Joint in 1993 offers over an hour of lengthy, grinding blues dirges with Junior & friends churning out their signature brand of whiskey-drenched Mississippi grunge...the playing is the antithesis of urban contemporary blues polish with lots of wrong notes and missed cues, but all of the imperfections simply add to the end result, some of the most truthful and moving blues waxed to disc. Kimbrough's death in early 98' was a serious blow to the longevity of this kind of music; all we're left with now are a handful of documents such as this as testaments of his brilliance."
3,Peterson Down Under,"This book never left my side while I was in Oz, although at times I thought about leaving it behind. My biggest complaint would be size; this book is a bit too large to be a proper field guide. It is as thick as Nat'l Geo, but about an inch longer in width and height. The plates were more than adequate, however few birds were shown in juv. plumage. Good text descriptions, notes on behaviors, and birds in flight usually shown. Very Peterson-esque. Half of the book is a handbook at the back. Plenty of good life history info. on the birds, but not necessary in the field. If only the handbook came as a seperate supplement . . .One last note: I did not see another book either in stores or in another birder's hand while in Australia that I thought was as good or better than this guide."
1,Unhappy,The product could not be shipped to my location. I am not even sure if my money was still for this purchase attempt?
3,Mikes review,This motor was very noisy. It needs a lotof grease and /or graphite to quiet it down to bearable levels.
5,top stuff,Sergei Nakariakov displays an amazing ability with the trumpet when he plays musics designed for other instruments with rapid change of notes. It is utterly amazing to hear him achieve this on the trumpet.
5,Sergei Nakariakov - No Limit,"Mr. Nakariakov is an incredible talent. While not an expert on the trumpet, I can not imagine finding someone with higher technical skills in playing difficult music. At the same time, the tonal quality of his performances is not overshadowed by the technical difficulty."
4,Cat Skidoo,"Cat Skidoo is a delightful book for preschoolers. The little mischievious kittens are adorable. They have quite a knack for getting into some scrapes. However, they way they get from one scrape to another is also funny. I would like to see this as a cartoon, so entertaining and one I could watch with my niece after a day of playing with her kittens. I know my niece enjoyed this book and she also really liked the illustrations. I recommend this as a must read for any preschoolers in your life. Delightful and lovely."
2,intricate,"This book is very hard to get into. It takes quite a while before you 'think' you understand what's going on or even what era it is. I did give it two stars, I didn't care for it even the end left me wondering. I think the only reason I finished it was because I kept thinking the light would come on and I would go, okay, now I get it. The book is involved with curves. I wouldn't recommend unless you have time to waste."
2,Not for me,"I don't really care for books set in that time but thought I would give it a try. But, wasn't in the mood for it the day I started to read. Slow pace, as is that time period, and maybe I'll try again later."
1,Just awful,"""....blood would spurt and be staunched in murder's furtive scuffle."" If you understand this line then this book might be for you. I couldn't make it to the second chapter. This book just didn't flow for me, reading should be enjoyable, not a puzzle that I can't put together."
5,"Funny, hip, accurate, and fascinating.","Funny, hip, accurate, and fascinating--what could possibly be wrong with a book whose chapter on the 17th century is titled ""Louie, Louie?"" It covers all the technical terms, shows the relationships between ripped jeans and the Reformation, and doesn't leave out makeup, shoes, gloves or plastic surgery. There is life after social anthropology"
3,Unpredictable and Almost Believable,"The lives of six troubled, insecure protagonists, and one author, converge during a snowstorm in this suspense thriller. Their current situation is enticingly unpredictable and believable, except for the concatenation of bad choices made by everyone. But we learn that is to be expected, given the tragic or pitiful backgrounds of each character, which the author intertwines, one at a time, with the current story.It is an ambitious endeavor, handling six POV's, since each of their backstories has enough psychosis or twisted irony to warrant a separate novel. The author solves her problem by condensing the six histories to pivotal events, and clearly stating the lessons unlearned. She wraps up her plot in a similar manner, making certain that her readers will not have compassion for any of her sorry characters.I did find the suspenseful wait for the next typo invigorating, however."
1,Thriller/Mystery - Pretty Gruesome,"And thats just the quality of the writing, the real mystery is why the author bothered, and why anyone should want to go to the trouble of publishing it."
1,Unbearable,"I have read Lizard Wine, and every one of Elizabeth Engstrom's books that are still in print. They are terrible, each and every one. You might ask why, if I thought that they were terrible, that I would take the time to read them. It's because I was hoping against hope that I'd find something of hers worth reading. - I'd give this book and all her books less than one star if it were possible. This book reads like ""rush hour"" traffic - slow, plodding, BORING!!!!!"
4,good album from a great band,it's not my favorite BJ album but it's a very good one. BJ keeps reinventing themselves
4,very good CD!,I have enjoyed much of BonJovi's music for many years. This CD is certainly not a disappointment! I am a country music fan...so the slight country sound of this CD was interesting to me...but I have found you don't have to be a country fan to enjoy it. There is a very nice mix of music...from the soft gentle Make a Memory to the really fun upbeat party song..We Got It Going On...it just seems to get better each time I hear it!
4,"Great album, but not the best","When I recieved Lost Highway, I was terrified about how country Bon Jovi had gone. But when I listened to tracks like ""Lost Highway"", ""Summertime"", etc. I was surprised. There is a rock feel to the songs, but just with a little extra twang. It was not a disaster as I thought it would be. I really hope for the next album, they'll return to rock. But I must say Lost Highway was not a dissapointment. Bon Jovi still rocks, even when they explore their country side. Bon Jovi is the greatest band ever in my book, I mean, I'd still buy their albums, even if they went hip hop or rap! I guess for a band that has lasted since 1984,you have to explore some new areas. But lets just hope that they return to what made them great. Good old hard rock! This album is a must buy for Bon Jovi fans. It mixes good old Bon Jovi rock with country. It's not their best album, that slot goes to Keep the Faith, but it is a very good CD."
4,"A great CD, Nice change up and blend for the guys for Jersey","I must admit, I was scared at initial reports about this album. Rumor Had it that it was heavily Nashville influenced and Country sounding. Yeah, maybe some, but not to damaging. Yeah, it may have a bit more acoustic guitar mixed in, A bit of a fiddle in the background, but there is plenty of electric and overall more rock than country, and Definitely Bon Jovi. Great song writing, and nobody can pen a love song or Ballad like John Bon Jovi and his friend. My Favorite in recent albums was Crush, and Bouce was a bit down, Have a Nice day did fair, but I agree, this Album is really good. My biggest fear was it would be an album like ""this left feels right"", and I did not care for it. But relax fans, the Jersey boys are back, great evolution of sound on this album. Definite must buy, great direction for the group, but I'm sure more rock is still to come."
5,Bon Jovi,"This is my favorite CD. I bought it when it first came out and it got broken. I have been wantiong to replace it since, just didnt. Now I wonder how I lived without it."
5,Great driving music,I like to listen to this Bon Jovi album when I am cruising down the highway - especially on sunshine days when I can drop the top on the convertible.
3,Bon Jovi sorta goes country... eh.,"HAVE A NICE DAY was probably the best Bon Jovi album since NEW JERSEY. After the success of the country version of ""Who Says You Can't Go Home,"" the guys decided to stick around Nashville for a while and turned out their next album from there. LOST HIGHWAY isn't really a strict country album, but the influence is clearly evident and results in a rather disappointing album. A couple songs still have that Bon Jovi rock sound, but others are just too country. Not that I dislike country (I love it), but I like my Bon Jovi rocking. ""Lost Highway,"" ""Summertime"" and ""We Got It Going On"" (featuring backing vocals by Big & Rich, the worst duo in country music history) are the standout tracks. Overall, this is more Bon Jovi Light, best suited for country fans who might like Bon Jovi but not their rock sound. It's okay, but hopefully next time the boys will return to New Jersey, get back to their rock sound, and turn out a worthy follow-up to HAVE A NICE DAY."
4,They just keep on going,"I've got to hand it to Jon, Ritchie and the others, they keep on putting out good music. ""Make a memory"" is worth the price of the CD alone to me. There are lots of catchy, story telling tracks on the project and the production is top notch. I would have liked to hear more from Sambora, and would have appreciated 2 or 3 harder edged songs. It's an easy listen, somewhat eclectic and keeps moving."
5,Bon Jovi Rocks in a NEW Style,"Lost Highway is a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure what to expect after hearing that it had a twist of country sound, but I LOVE it! I bought it at the beginning of the summer and listened to it on my MP3 while traveling all over Europe. It felt good to have a piece of home with me any time I wanted it. Right from the title song, Lost Highway, the rhythm and lyrics grab you. Jon Bon Jovi's voice still has his characteristic strong edge, but crafted in a haunting way to make the songs stick in your mind. Make a Memory, Seat Next to You, Everybody's Broken, and Stranger with Leanne Rimes are unforgettable! We Got It Going On and I Love This Town bring back the sounds of Bon Jovi from the 80's.I enjoy this CD! It's well rounded, matured yet full of excitement!"
4,Jon Bon Jovi just keeps getting better,"Country music done Bon Jovi-style is something worth investing in. Though a lot of people feel that Bon Jovi has `sold out', the truth is that this is a very solid country-rock album, in the best sense of that term.Credit Jon Bon Jovi for knowing exactly what to do with the right tune. Every song here is a killer, and don't judge the album by the merits of the first single (as great as the song is). ""Lost Highway"" only suffers when it tends to get a little sappy for its' own good (the lyrics tend to veer toward Richard Marx territory every so often), but the core of the album screams `country'!The standout tracks are ""Stranger"" - a strangely successful duet with LeAnn Rimes, and ""I Love this Town"", where the boys sing to Nashville.Everything on this record just WORKS. Yes, its no `Slippery When Wet' or even `Blaze of Glory', but if you like tuning into an artists' evolution, then this is the album for you. Just can't go wrong."
4,Age appropriate,I was hesitant to buy this CD at first because I was afraid that only one song would be good and the rest wouldn't be. It turns out that this CD is more mellow than other Bon Jovi CDs but it's also more original which I love. I find myself listening over and over to this in the car and love it. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a Bon Jovi fan. I also like the fact that the group has matured with their age which is refreshing. They don't try to be 25 eternally like some bands. EXCELLENT.
3,They can still write some decent songs,"Admittedly, I didn't think much of Lost Highway upon first listen. However, it grew on me a little after I heard it a few more times. Although this is a very safe sounding album, similar to today's country music which is much closer to pop than country, they still can write some good songs. While tracks like ""Summertime"", ""Whole Lot of Leavin'"", and ""Any Other Day"" won't make you forget their best work, they're still very good. The tracks with more of a country twang (""Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore"", ""One Step Closer"", ""Seat Next To You"", etc) are also pretty decent. There are a few clunkers here, most notably ""We Got It Going On"", a forced attempt at a country/rock anthem that sounds lame. All told, Lost Highway is a decent album and to their credit, at least they're not going Michael Bolton and putting out albums of cover tunes like Poison and Def Leppard."
5,I Love Bon Jovi,This is an excellent CD. There is some country sound to it which is not usually my favorite but Bon Jovi makes is work! If you love Jon I highly recommend this CD.
2,"Too much country, not enough ""old school""","While I am a BIG Bon Jovi fan, this albumn has really disappointed me. I realize that John Bon Jovi has taken a new road as far as his music. However, this albumn has too much of a country sound and feel. There is not enough rock and what helped Bon Jovi (unlike the many hair bands of the 80's) survive throughout the years. If you like the new country sound, this albumn may be just what you are looking for. If not, I suggest maybe just buying the singles that you like. (If you can find one.) For the country lovers, "" I love this town"" ,is a song you will really like . For the rockers at heart, you maybe extremely disappointed by this albumn."
3,not bad,"I've been a fan of bon jovi since 1988(new jersey)old fans would have notice the changes in JBJ's vocal style, however since ""destination anywhere"" I keep wondering where goes his briliant vocals in ""keep the faith to these days"" era? about lost highway still i'm waiting for JBJ's rock voice, however their recent album have much potency in commercial teritory. musically i think bon jovi is fair enough to include old sound and new sound as well to please old and new fans. to me, I would give 5 Stars if JBJ sings like in ""These days"" and for the music i think richie, tico and david have done fantastic job. by the way, i've noticed the moffats sound in ""one step closer"". have you noticed to??????????"
2,Boring,"With Bon Jovi it is hit and miss. One of my favorite bands, so I get every album. But this one bored me the first week."
1,LOST is right - Jon betrays ROCK:,"Forget even categorizing him as rock, this is full-on country. Even the name is cliché as all hell. Way too many ballads. The musicianship doesn't even constitute a good country album; besides, he's completely forgotten his roots in the quest to become ever-popular + relevant. To the real fans that have known him since the S/T '83 album + before this is total sonic blasphemy. Don't get me wrong, Young Guns really was a great album; but every time he returns to the cowboy motif he goes further + further in. Whether it's their age showing or the influence of whatever girlfriend Richie has at the time, they've decided to bury any remaining sign of their pop-metal past. A ""Chris Gaines"" album in reverse.For a REAL BJ album check out 7800 Fahrenheit or Slippery!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"I was never a big fan of Bon Jovi, but when I heard they did a country cross over album I was intrigued. I love southern rock and I figure maybe Bon Jovi could excel in that type of genre. But of course, Bon Jovi is still Bon Jovi and this album is awful. It sounds like over produced dribble. The music at time can be catchy, but more in the way of a used car commercial. The lyrics are absolutely painful to listen to. Whoever is reviewing this as a good album really has no business offering opinions on music because clearly this is not a good album."
2,"Laughable attempt at a ""Bon Jovi"" album...","I'm really not sure where I even start with this album...it seems like Jon and Richie are just lost and don't know how to make good music any more. Apparently, commercial success is more important to them than good music nowadays. Nothing like jumping on the country bandwagon and riding it for every dollar you can! The past two Bon Jovi albums have been serious missteps...and this one is no different. It sounds just like you think it would...Bon Jovi trying to do modern country. The sad thing is that most of these songs will be huge hits...if not by Bon Jovi, then by the next no-talent country ""star"" who covers them. The inclusion of Big and Rich...the ultimate in a long line of country ""artists"" who couldn't write their way off a blank sheet of paper only further negates from Bon Jovi's attempt at a legit record. Poor effort all around..."
4,Great CD!!,"This cd stayed in my car player for a couple of weeks, before I could bring myself to change it out. 'Make a Memory' is an incredibly beautiful song and sentiment, with a message about hope for a previously lost love. Being a LeAnn Rimes fan, I love the duet 'Til We Ain't Strangers Anymore'. 'Everybody's Broken' is both sad and encouraging at the same time. Bon Jovi has the ability to write songs that, if really listened to, can touch the hearts of many people. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys Bon Jovi and listens to the words of songs."
5,Another Bon Jovi success,"Great cd. I knew when I heard him sing Make a Memory on American Idol, that I would have to pre-order this cd from Amazon.I appreciate his hard work in songwriting, and creating a different kind of music than he's already put out there.He's still hot after all these years."
5,A CD I would want to have if I was lost on the highway,"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since day one, and have every CD that they have made, Have A Nice Day was Awesome, After hearing Lost Highway I loved the changed in the music and songs. More country-rock You have got to get this CD it is great, My favorite guys have proved that after all these years they can still rock !!!"
4,Shop Around!!!,"Bon Jovi is still kicking it out. I give this 4 stars to raise your head up. This is the Walmart special that sells for only $14. They are probally hard to find now due to kind folks buying them all up & then reselling- SCALPING them on places like Amazon & Ebay. The DVD is a ""CMT pick"" & is a limited edition. This is not the same dvd that comes with the Japanese Import but caution there too- it only plays in region 3 & wont play in region 1 the USA."
4,This is what I think about the album...,"This album is a very good album, John Bon Jovi is a very talented man. But of coarse the rest of the band has their responsibilities as well. The only reason I rate it with 4 stars is because this album sound a little different then past albums; but it was supposed to, It is a great album and I don't regret buying it at all, I am very happy I bought it. The only reason why I am telling that I don't regret buying it is because I am the type of person that will Buy a full album for just one song. And you know it must be a great album, because I bought it for just one song, and that song isn't even the song that I want to listen to all time because there is a better song on the cd. Its the type of song that you want to play very loud because you can enjoy it more that way. and as soon as you have the cd and play it you will know exactly what song I am talking about. Enjoy the cd once you have it."
5,Bon Jovi Fan from the beginning.........,"Any TRUE Bon Jovi fan will love this CD! As I listened to this for the first time, I kept thinking how great it will be to see it performed live! Call it ""coutry-ish"" if you want but I think it's AWESOME. Jon and the guys still ROCK!"
2,Not worth the money- very disappointing product,"The cover was too short- didn't cover the entire grill...material is flimsy....had a hole in it the first week...I am actually looking for another cover-thicker, longer and better quality-very disappointed."
4,cool grill cover,this is a cool grill cover and having the yankees logo on it makes it even cooler. a must have for any yankee fan indeed.
3,Too Small...,"The quality was good and so was the deign, but, it only covered half of my grill! It could be my fault - maybe I should have measured my grill & compared it to the measurements of the cover, but, the description said that it fits most large grills & I've seen grills much larger than mine, so I assumed it would fit. It arrived on time & without any problems. I would recommend this to any fans of grilling and any Yankee fans, but, I would measure your grill first!!"
1,Cheap plastic,This is no good don't waste your money on something that's going to rip or tear 1 week after you put it on your grille
5,BIG HIT/revised,"This one was just awesome as far as hubby is concerned. He REALLY likes this. Very nicely made...Revised 5 January 2013; I really meant to revise this sooner but just forgot until now. Originally we thought this was great and well made, but in all truthfulness this cover only lasted about 9-10months and then began to rip in several places, and oddly enough it wasn't at any of the seams! We really expected much better and longer use out of it and were really disappointed when it began to rip and tear. So pretty, but such cheap flimsy material. Turned out that the stitching out lasted the materials! So unless you intend to keep your grill covered inside an outer building...save money and buy something with thicker material and paint your own NY symbol on it!"
1,Would not buy this item,"Although it looks great, it is made extremely cheap, But not cheap to purchase! Ripped along side after second use."
3,Does the job,"It covers the grill sufficiently, and does have the Yankees logo on it. However, I would have liked the grill cover to be a bit thicker. We'll have to see how it does this winter."
4,Yankee Grill Cover,"I received the grill cover later than I had hoped but overall am pleased with the purchase. It's plastic, adjustable, and durable and does the job. I recommend the grill cover."
2,You call this heavy duty?,"this plastic is the thinest, cheapest plastic you can buy to cover a grill. It is comparable to a 3-ply garbage bag."
2,Better off using a plastic bag,"This cover looks great, but serves no purpose. I recieved this cover and realized it was as thin as a plastic trash bag. I think this would rip the first time I was to put it on the grill. Fansedge was great and let me return it. Just be aware it is VERY thin!"
1,help,can anyone give me any information about this book i live in the uk and the publishers for koontz here know nothing about a uk release.
4,High quality Puzzle,Its always nice to open a puzzle and see a high quality well packaged item. The Piatnik company never fails to please. Thick board and good graphics. I find this size takes about two weeks of evenings if I am working it in between TV shows. Nice product
1,las vegas,"I haven't heard the CD, but if it's like what I heard in Las Vegas at The Aladin Hotel, I'm sure I will be pleased. I am in awe with his talent, I can appreciate him changing with age, and I'm sure that he will attract a much more mature fan base. One that appreciates him as an artist. Prince, you were jammin in Vegas. Continue to grow in your craft."
1,The Purple Reign is sadly over,Prince needs to retire. His mind is poisoned by Larry Graham and he blame everyone for his own shortcomings. Just release the vault outtakes from the 80's and early 90's and stop preachin and complaining.
5,Awesome,"Even if your not a Prince fan, this album will blow you away if your a music lover. His arrangements and the level of perfection on this album is out of this world.You just dont know what he'll do next on every song. The solo's, the breaks, the singing and musicianship is one of the best I've heard on one single album. You also get the feeling that they are enjoying it, yet so disciplined and organised. None of the songs are overplayed and even the tracks that are over 7 or 8 minutes keep you on the egde waiting for more magic. This album is worth every penny. Buy it."
5,A Dying Breed Among Black Muscians,"This set is beautiful.If you want old Prince, go buy Purple Rain.At the age of 44, his muscianship is very impressive.The packaging is very impressive also and includes details about the tour and the people that played, excluding the drummer from the Roots (whats his name.) That guy with the outdated afro.The music is impressive as it has very minimal overdubs and has Prince showcasing his guitar skills, his jazz skills and the skills of his very tight band.Disc I is mostly his new jazzy tunes from The Rainbow Children.Disc II is mostly the old cuts minus the dreaded Purple Rain, which I am glad has been put to rest.Disc III is the best CD which includes George Clinton and Musiq Soulchild and the greatest guitar solo by Prince you will ever hear legally.That solo is worth the price of the set.It will blow some fuses in your car.This is a great gift for MATURE music listeners."
5,Speechless,"I could not have said anything about this ablum better than 'funkyjurist' whose review appears in this list. I'd been saving my money 4EVER to get this boxed set, and I am not one bit disappointed! It is amazing; the slow songs were beautiful (as was his voice) and the up tunes rocked as always, yet in a new familiar way. Prince truly is THE genius; the man can do anything. Every fan should have this boxed set. Plus, it's the only live album I've bought where the background audience doesn't drown out the main singer; PRINCE!"
3,"Great, But the Price Is Ridiculous","It's a great listen, sure, but paying nearly [$] a CD for a three-CD set is ridiculous. And people wonder why file-sharing's so popular. Plus, seeing as it's only three CDs, did they really have to use a box set deisgn? The CDs could have easily fit in a typical 3-CD jewel case and still allowed for an extensive booklet."
3,it was good but lacking...........,"Peace and Blessings....With the everyone doing ""Live"" albums, i was happy to see that prince was stepping up. while i have some imported live cd's, i couldnt wait to get an official one.... while this cd is good, its not what i hoped for. I know that Prince couldnt have packed all of the hits on the cd's but i was really hoping for longer versions of some of the older songs: I Wanna Be Your Lover, Do Me Baby and Starfish and Coffee.But then again, he worked such new songs as: Mellow, Avalanche, 1+1+1 is 3(Prince went back to the funk roots here),Xenophobia and The Other Side Of The Pillow...... and old songs: Adore, How Come You Dont Call Me.....this is a cd for New Prince fans.....we older fans will have to stick to our imports for the real hits"
4,Not bad for a box set,"Prince is my idol but he has a lot of work to do to get back on top again. He must learn that the same ol' thing is not working! He has to be more innovative and more creative to keep up with the best. Obviously, R&B is his possible prefered genre. He got to stick with it."
1,A Sad Display...,"Each of these so-called ""live"" discs is horrible. Anyone with even half a brain can tell that this is manufactured to sound like a real concert recording, but the studio overdubs mar the entire project. I own a rare bootleg of his ""Sign 'O' The Times"" concert film on CD from France, 1987 and it easily smokes any of these discs, if you can find it as an import, it will cost you a pretty penny but get it, it's THE live Prince recording to own. Any real fan and collector should skip this disaster altogether.Prince should have never let this see the light of day. A True Shame."
1,Stinky stuff by a stinky man,"This is not the same Prince that dominated the music scene of the '80s. This is a 3 disc stink bomb that makes one wonder how talent can dry up so fully that it leaves nothing but a stinky vapor in the air. Yes, Prince can still play intruments well. And yes, it is nice to hear some of his classic songs like ""Raspberry Beret"" and ""I wanna Be Your Lover"". But I've heard Prince tribute bands that didn't stink this bad. There are some long boring jams on this record, and a LOT of songs from his last studio album (The Rainbow Children). I had to shower after I listened to this, using all natural soap! Unite ladies!"
5,**THE REAL ARTIST**,"Prince is amazing. I've been a long time fan of Prince and I've got to say this cd blew me away. Jazz,Funk,metal,r&b,The man can do it all and proves it. He is one of the true artists of our time."
5,Denny1970,"Dynamite!! Absolutely Dynamite!! This is probably the best that i've heard from Prince since the Gold Experince album. He makes you feel as though you are actually at the concert when you listen to this album. ""The Rainbow Children"" and the ""Peach extended jam"" are the two main muthafunka's that will have you bobbin' ya head(in my opinion). He does major work with ""Joy in Repitition"", ""Family name"" and ""Mellow"" as well. This box set is a must have for true Prince fans."
2,review,"When I ordered this CD, there was nothing to indicate that it was only the hird CD. I would have never ordered just one of a three disc set. The CD itself is fine but I feel that I was misled as to what I was getting."
4,Wish I would have Been There!,"Very hot, at times experimental, incredible muscicianship, and flat out funky songs! A great package, and worth every penny."
3,Great Machine when it works!,After six months this stopped working. It took awhile to figure out how to get the sound machine to work after using the radio. When it did work for the first six months and it helped my daughter sleep through the night. We always have a lot going on in the house and when it is too quiet she would wake up! I highly recommend a sound machine that works!
2,"Conair SU7 Sound Therapy, wasted money","This is a poorly designed product in my opinion. First off why would you ever need so many sounds to choose from if you are just trying to fall asleep, why pay for the extra sounds? The clock is totally usless it cannot be read at night even with glasses. I went with a $10.00 model with rechargable batteries which is nice for traveling."
1,One hour wonder,"The sound therapy function stopped working after 1hr. the rest of the machine still works. We did not bother to return the item because the shipping would be almost as much as the item was anyhow. It was however a magical hr. Up to the point it broke we enjoyed it greatly. I guess we got a lemon, you get what you pay for."
2,EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!,Let me start of by saying that I hate the sound of a blaring buzzer waking me up in the morning. I vented my irritation to my dad and he sent me this in the mail. I previewed the different sounds which personally I wasn't really impressed with because of the bad sound quality. I kept in mind that I am not trying to use this as a device to go to sleep with only a pleasant sound to awake to. So I followed the manual to try and pick a sound for the alarm to wake me with. IT KEEPS GOING BACK TO THE STUPID RUNNING STREAM SOUND WHICH I HATE!!! I am beyond INFLAMED!!! WHY WON'T IT DO WHAT I WANT IT TO DO!!? AM I DOING SOMETHING WRONG? Someone please tell me how to fix this because I know that this machine is capable of doing this. I have spent a few hours setting the alarm to different times and trying different methods to no avail. I even went on the conair website for FAQs and called support. I would really love if someone helped me out with this. Thank you.
1,"Doesn't even turn , what a ""rip-off""","I plugged in this product and it only displayed a blue screen. No sound, no digital display. Also I paid extra for overnight delivery and it took an extra day.W"
2,Disappointing.,"I chose this product over the others in its price range because it seemed to have a variety of interesting sounds. I was disappointed and sent it back. While it has many sounds, they're all muffled because of the poor speaker quality and placement. And a lot of them include shrieky birds - not very lulling.Honestly, if you're a person who likes good design, this is not the product for you. On top of its mediocre performance, it's quite big and pretty homely. Hopefully, they'll do better the next go-round."
1,"Sound yes, clock no!","I bought this when I was shopping for a sound machine along with a Marpac White Noise Machine Sleep Mate Sound Screen 980 Dual Speed Sound Conditioner My kids loved the Conair SU7 at first but I had to make them turn it off because it was too annoying. The Marpac, although twice the price, was far superior to the Conair. It has 2 volume/power levels and both are sufficient to quiet the noises from my kids for me to nap.The Conair may be good for those who like digitally produced nature noises but they graded on my nerves. The clock might as well have been left off of this unit. The alarm setting is not at all intuitive and the display is invisible in the dark. At night the digital display only appears as a bright or dim blue rectangle. I would have given it a higher rating if it were not advertized as a clock."
3,Good sound not a good clock,"This great for the number of sounds that are available; however, the clock is very difficult to see the time if you are at the wrong angle. I have it sitting on a dresser that's about four feet tall and I cannot see the time if I am sitting in the rocking chair a few feet away. I've tried using different contrasts but it hasn't helped. I love it for my baby and it was worth the cost."
2,Get a better one....,"I purchased this after hearing how soothing a white noise machine is to a sleeping infant. After unpackaging this sound machine, it appeared to be better than the one my niece has. The bird-type sounds are nice, but I really just wanted a plain white noise machine. The actual white noise on this product has a very choppy sound, and I could tell right away where it started and ended. I am bringing this back to the store today and will continue my search."
4,Surf and sound!,"Bought this to resolve distracting background noises that interupted sleep...Very Good product...Going to sleep with the ocean surf in the background almost 300 miles from the ocean and waking up to local radio are my favorite features! Value priced and the radio sound quality is good....Sound therapy backgrounds Tropical Rain Forest, Rainfall, Ocean Surf are my favorites...Least favorites, White noise and a Edgar Allen Poe-like heartbeat I could live without...."
2,Doesn't work after only 6 months!,"We bought this for the nursery and it worked pretty well until just this week. For no reason, it now just shuts off the sound randomly whenever it feels like it. Really unreliable when our baby doesn't sleep well without white noise. And it's not like we can sneak into his room to turn it back on without fully waking him up. We started using this thing back in April or May of 2012 and it's only the end of November!Another annoying thing is the the time on the LED screen is super hard to read unless you are the perfect angle. So you basically can only read it if you are standing up or sitting down in the rocker, not both. The screen is also a bit too bright when you are trying to keep the room dark.Other than that, the number of sounds is nice and it's fairly small/light enough to travel with, although the batteries die after 2-3 nights of use."
2,Conair SU7 Sound Therapy and Relaxation Clock Radio,"every one of the sound tracks on this machine have annoying backround noise or short repeating tracks. this made it impossible for my husband and i to fall asleep. even the white noise has some sort of repeating background static or something - not a smooth steady ""white noise"" sound. sound might be ok for those who just want to wake with it, but not good to go sleep with. i returned this product after trying it for a week and received immediate reimbursement from Amazon. great doing business with Amazon - never any problem with returns!"
1,more akin to total horse manure..........can't give the product zero stars,"at least horse manure will help a garden grow bought this machine to help my new dog calm down when I need to leave him in his crate and leave the house. The AC adapter will not fit into its slot. When I add batteries and try and turn on sounds or the radio, nothing comes through the speaker.When you call and ask for customer support they ask for the model and serial number of the unit but this information is in raised plastic on the bottom of the unit. The frustrating thing is the company will not pay the costs of shipping the product back for servicing and the cost is just more money that I will pay from something that is defective from the start"
4,Godd Product for the Money,Gave this as a gift. Have listened to it and the people we gave it to really like it. Good product for the money.
2,"White noises are pretty good, alarm clock radio... not so much.","I thought it would be nice to replace my alarm clock, but after setting the alarm time, I couldn't change it. After reading the instructions and setting the alarm time, there are no instructions to RE-set the alarm time. I finally figured out that you have to unplug the unit to be able to change the alarm time. The sounds are pretty good, but with the difficulty of using the alarm on the clock radio, I prefer to use a seperate sound machine,and keep my old clock radio."
1,Do not buy this machine!,"The display sucks, the sound therapy worked the first time I turned it on and never worked again. Save your money and buy a different product."
3,Not for people with insomnia.,"First let me say that I own 3 of these, one in each of my kids bedrooms. It has alot of sounds which is nice, and its sufficient for background noise for kids or for people who do not have trouble sleeping. However if you do actually have difficulty sleeping I would not buy this product. The sound guality is kind of poor and you can hear the loop, I end up grinding my teeth to the rythm of the ""waterfalls"". I have heard other sound machines that blend the sound seemlessly, but this one costs significantly less, so it has worked out well for the kids. I have owned them for over 3 years and have had no problems with them not working."
5,Great Sound Machine,Have 3 of these now. Use in kids rooms and in our bedroom. Have worked perfectly. Loud enough. Blue clock light is good for kids night lights.
3,OKAY product,"Product seems to skip, so Initally I was going to send this back, but decided to keep it in the bathroom and use as a radio."
2,Clock doesn't work/Fake sound,"The clock doesn't work and the sound is so fake. There are only 2 that I can handle. Why do you have to spend 60 bucks to get a decent noise machine? DON'T BUY THIS FOR THE WHITE NOISE! It is horrible, I expected the sound of a fan,or something and it is a horrible TV static sound."
1,Disappointed,This noise machine did not work right out of the box. I left town and was going to use it at motels on my extended trip but it never worked. Can not get home in order to send it back.
2,Product Review,"I was disappoint in this product. The first few nights it was good, but after that it wasn't. It seemed that after you played the ""sound"" for a bit, you could hear other annoying sounds in the background of the soothing sound. I tried turning the volume up & down and I could still hear it."
2,Not so great,"I received this for Christmas. After a month of using it, the back light stopped working. And it wasn't easy to read to begin with. At least I can still have the sound. I know it can happen to any product. Just a little disappointed."
4,Thanks Amazon,"I just purchased this product and took it to Alaska and used it for two weeks! It's not sound perfect, and the contrast lighting on the face could be a bit better but I give it high marks for getting a lot for my money: Radio, Clock, Alarm, White Noise - along with other sounds and options. Very nice."
1,both units arrived defective- save your money!,"Horrible, low quality product! I purchased this for my child who has difficulty sleeping at night. The first unit we ordered, the nature sounds stopped working completely the same day it was opened. With the second, replacement unit, the radio stopped working the second day we had it. I will not be buying any more machines from this company. They should be embarrassed at the low quality control. Don't let the low price tempt you- save your money and time and purchase elsewhere."
4,Like it a lot,"I bought 2 for each of my kids and they are hooked. I've got the white noise setting in each of their rooms and it drowns out everything. Yes, it does have the annoying ""loop"" recording for the white noise-which is why my setting is the ocean waves. I can't sleep and either can they w/o it. It is also a great night light in the room (as long as the bright blue light isn't facing them). The price is right and it's portable."
2,"Horrible display, buttons don't work, unreliable product","This product is pretty bad. I've put the machine on shelves in front of our rocker so I know what time the baby gets up, but I can't even read the display at anything other than a direct angle. The display is also over-bright. I think the worst thing, however, is that the buttons that allow you to choose the type of sound don't work -- half the time you mash them, nothing happens. This product is cheap and behaves as such. I would not recommend this to a friend."
3,Conair SU7 Sound Therapy.and Relaxation Clock Radio,"I love the sound therapy, but I set the alarm, and can't find a way to cancel it.So, I've tried just pulling the plug and resetting the clock, but last night I got wok up at midnight with the alarm!Wish I knew what to do??? If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it."
1,Nothing Good about this Machine,The sounds are really mechanical sounding and you can't see the clock unless you look exactly eye level with the time. I saw the reviews and thought for $25 what do you expect? More than this machine provides.
1,totally doesn't work,I'm throwing it away today about 2 weeks after it arrived. When I first turned it on the light on the clock flashed on and then died. It worked for a couple weeks otherwise. Now the sound machine goes on for about 5 seconds and then the power kicks off. None of the other features work -- like the radio. A waste of money.
3,BRIGHT LIGHT!,Wow this is one bright clock. IT is VERY difficult to read the time if it is during the day and you are not looking at it head on. The sound is good and the radio reception is very good. We bought two of them. One for each children's room.
2,Purchased for the Sound Alarm Clock Function,I spilled water on the alarm clock I used for years and had to replace it. I woke to soft ocean sounds and was looking for a replacement clock that had that function. I purchased the Conair SU7 and found the instructions confusing and the alarm function only worked for a week. The lighted dial is also very bright. I had to turn it away from the bed. I returned the clock and will keep looking.
1,Conair SU7 Sound therapy and relaxation clock radio,"This product is not as good as i thought. I have been dissappointed in the amount of static that comes from the product, when turned on. Everything works,clock,sounds, radio, but there is a continuous sound of static coming from it, which is irratating...have not chose to return it, because of the inconvenience......"
1,Waste of money,Well...unfortunately this was a birthday present for my daughter. It might be a good product if it had come with some paperwork or instructions.
1,A mind of it's own - Waste of money,This alarm clock is not user friendly. You are obligated to read the instructions to figure out how to set time/alarm/radio. Most alarm clocks are self-explanatory. The screen is so bright it hurts your eyes to look at it in the dark and its impossible to make out the time from 99% of the angles in the room. Also it should be easy to change between the 10 different sounds and the radio. But my radio won't change it's literally stays stuck on a mode and I have to unplug it for a few minutes to get to another mode. Then I have to reprogram everything. Just to encounter the same inconvenient waste of time and frustrating situation the next day. If you are looking to buy this please don't. I am dependent on white noise to sleep and this defective alarm clock radio has caused me sleepless nights. It's not worth it.
4,Gift registery item!,Ordered this for my niece from her baby shower registery. Baby isn't here yet; but she was thrilled with it! Therefore can't say how effective it is yet! Service was super quick - @ my door in 2 days - and item came in perfect condition! LOVE shopping Amazon!
2,Kept Awake by Blue Display Light,"I love everything about this clock - especially the sound features. EXCEPT all of that is negated by the fact that the display light is BRIGHT blue even on the lowest setting. We are unable to get to sleep with the bright blue light illuminating the entire room. The solution is to cover the display, but then I have no idea what time it is. So, if you don't mind light, this is a great clock. The sounds are exceptional!"
2,mediocre,"I didnt like several things on this clock. Used it for a couple of weeks and put it away. The display is poorly designed. The curved glass on the front makes it that you can not read it unless you look at it head on, standing a few feet back from it. The display is also too bright in a dark room even in the dimmer of the two settings but maybe this is meant to be night light feature. The sounds are fine but the quality was already decaying after a couple of uses. I didnt buy it for the radio feature but the reception on it is somewhat weak. Waste of money really."
5,Love It for a Baby and for myself,We live on a very busy street and this noise machine really makes a huge difference for me and my baby. He actually seems to sleep much better now that he has the noise machine.
3,The clock doesn't work at all,"If you are ordering for the sound machine, it is a good enough product. I'm keeping this product only because of the sound machine. The clock doesn't work at all. I read the reviews complaining about the clock and thought it couldn't be as bad as that? But it is. If you want only the sound, the benefit is that it will not turn off until you turn it off. So if you need constant sound to sleep, this is a good product."
2,Not so great,"I ordered this in hopes of it being a good deal. Not so much. First of all, the blue screen is Super bright and it woke me up so much I had to put something in front of it. Then there are the sounds.... they are unrealistic. Another thing is that the clock would not keep time. I would set it and then it would always be wrong. Don't waste your money."
2,Not the best,"I just got this clock as a gift and the concept is great, but the clock is too bright and I have yet to be able to set either of the two alarms. The sounds are ok, but not all that natural sounding. I am considering exchanging for something else. Even if I do eventually get the alarm to set, I don't want to get frustrated everytime I need to change it."
1,Buy something else,"We sleep with the roar of box fans every night. Since we always have white noise while we're sleeping, we purchased this for a recent trip. It was useless. The loops are extremely short, and it's obviously when it starts over. Also, there is an odd frequency that can sometimes be heard. It's a pitch that seems to be barely audible to human ears, but it's incredibly annoying. Overall, if you're looking for a white noise machine, invest in a slightly more expensive model."
4,This is a really good product,"This product has really helped my 10 month old to be a better sleeper. He was sleeping so lightly, my husband and I were desperately seeking a solution. I prefer the ocean waves or the rain sounds. I leave it on at naptime and all night long while he's sleeping. It does a great job of filtering out the household sounds of our other 3 kiddos. As another reviewer mentioned, the sounds are so pleasant, they are actually pretty nice coming across the baby monitor...I do wish it had a way to slow some of the sounds in order to make them even more mellow."
4,It works,"Not the best alarm clock in the world, but solid overall. Has plenty of sounds to choose from, even though you probably won't use most of them."
4,Pleased with my purchase,I think for the money i spent i couldn't be happier. I researched many products to find the best one for the price. I purchased another one for a friend of mine because i liked it so much.
5,Great Sound Machine!,Excellent sound machine for the money. It has several sounds to chose from including white noise. My child surprised me and loves the bird setting. The clock can work as a night light. So good we bought one for our room!
4,Great little clock/sound machine,"Pro's: For the price, this is a great clock (I bought it for $17). The sounds are effective as white noise (the white noise does have a short loop, but I personally did not find it annoying). The alarm has lots of options and I like that you can set two wake times at once.Con's: You have to click the alarm button several times to set it, and remember to click it twice when you turn off the alarm (at least in radio mode). Maybe someone has found an easier way--but the instructions leave a little to be desired. Despite its brightness, the display is a little too low contrast for me to see it properly--I'm moderately nearsighted."
4,Sounds are good. Controls are not intuitive.,"I like the sound quality of the sound therapy. However, the controls for setting the alarm are not intuitive and consequently, I am usually nervous that I did not set the clock correctly. I like having a clock, sound therapy and radio all in one. It saves space."
5,Our baby loves it!,We first heard this model at friend's place and it was so soothing for our little one that we had to get one for us. We use it every day to put our baby asleep - money well spent :) Great product and irreplaceable...
4,Pretty Good Clock/Radio,"I like the radio, the sounds are just what I needed to relax & fall asleep easier. The only problem I have with it is because of the light you can't read the time very well unless you are right in front of it."
3,Decent for the price,"The sounds are not as good as a Brookstone one I have, but this one is ok. The light is a little too bright also. If you don't want to pay more this is probably about as good as you'll get, but I'd suggest a little more of an upgrade..."
3,not the best.,"I have used ""white noise"" machines for many years. This one has a few repeating noises that take away from the white noise effect and make it difficult to fall asleep sometimes. It's okay, but not the best I've used. Also, the radio has terrible reception, and the alarm is difficult to navigate but easy to ""accidentally"" set."
1,zero stars if I could,Defective. Alarm time buttons worked once. Same with the clock. Set it once; couldn't change it at Daylight Savings. That was my breaking point with this POS.
3,Tries to do too much?,"The sound components are fine, tho' at least one of the sounds doesn't work. The numbers aren't bright enough; black numbers on a blue background barely show. I can't get the alarm component to work. But the ocean sound is very good--I use it all night."
2,DONT MOVE,I THOUGHT ABOUT BUYINY THIS MACHINE FOR A LONG TIME I WISH I HAD THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE IT SOUNDS VERY VERY CHEAP VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE SITTING IN THE RAIN PLAYING THE DRUMS HITTING IN THE SAME SPOT EVERY FIVE SECONDS THE CLOCK IN THE RADIO ARE OKAY THATS WHY ILL KEEP IT
5,Wish I bought one sooner!,"I love this product! I wished I had bought these a long time ago, like when my kids were babies. We all sleep so soundly with these. The ocean waves are my favorite. They sound very real, I feel like I am falling asleep on the beach! You can put back-up batteries in it, which is great when the power goes out, because none of us can sleep in dead silence. The light is bright, but it hasn't bothered us any. We just put it where it is not directly in our face."
3,Not for a Nursery!,"It's a nice noise machine, however it does pick up interference from our baby video monitor. Also the clock light is VERY bright even on ""low"" setting. Too bright for my baby, so I have to cover it with something at night. So it's a nice noise machine but not for a nursery. The radio is useless if the baby monitor is on, since we get so much interference between the two that it's impossible to use it."
2,Sleepless,"The time and alarms are difficult to set. I was never able to get the alarms set. The sound-scape recordings are very short and it is easy to hear them repeating over and over -- very annoying. Because of this reason, I was unable to fall asleep. After a week of sleepless nights (while trying to adapt to the sound), I purchased a small ""high-velocity"" fan for $20.00 and it works to help drown out noise, like a ""noise maker"", and it keeps me cool. Finally I've been falling asleep and staying asleep both without having to adapt."
2,Kept me awake.,"To me, the sounds are not conducive to sleep because they have repetitive sounds within the sounds; similar to chanting. That's what I was hearing. A constant white noise was what I was after."
1,The looping kills it for me,"This would be great but for 2 flaws: 1) The clock light is too bright, even in low setting. And 2) (The biggie) The stupid click at the end of each loop. With the white noise you can hear the click between each looping of the white noise sound. Subtle when you are not paying attention, but a KILLER when you are trying to use the white noise to sleep. Very disappointed."
2,Should have taken the other reviews to heart...,"Much like others have reported, my unit also arrived defective. The alarm would ONLY beep (versus nature sounds or radio) regardless of how it was set, or what the display indicated for its function. This was the major deal-breaker for me, since I bought it specifically for its ""gentle"" wake up sounds.Yes, the display really is obnoxiously bright. Yes, the clock is impossible to read from most angles.I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I found the quality of the ""nature sounds"" to be pretty decent. If you wanted a nightlight/sound machine, this might not be a bad choice for the relatively cheap price.Amazon's customer service really came through for me on this item and readily refunded both the purchase price and the shipping when I contacted them about the issue."
5,great for the nursery,Lot of options to choose from and provides great soothing sounds for your child while they sleep.
5,Sound machine for traveling,I bought this sound machine to use when we travel with our 17-month old on vacation. It helps drown out any unfamiliar noises at this age and works like a charm for sleeping through the night. I've had him sleep with it a little bit at home to become familiar with the noises and now it is great to travel with. Just put batteries in and put in your suitcase and it travels great. Definitely recommended.
1,cheap junk,Dead on arrival. Is it too much to ask that the manufacturer plug it in and test it before they put it on the boat?
1,"Junk, it has already stopped working. Am going to send back.","We have only had this for a short time, now we have to go through the trouble of trying to pack this thing up and send it back, hopefully to get another one that will work or a refund. Too much trouble."
3,Good product with serious design problems,Sound therapy works well with a good selection of sounds...BUT don't expect to use the alarm features to get you up in the morning. Alarm is far to easy to accidently hit a button and turn alarm off or turn on an unwanted alarm.I was forced to buy a seperate alarm clock so I didn't miss work and set the alarms on the Conair to Noon so I could sleep in if I wanted.
2,Not a Clock!,"Bought this for background noise for my second son. Does the job, but I threw away a very old (dependable) digital clock before I realized you couldn't read the time unless you were directly in front and only two feet away. Very frustrating as I like to keep track of what time the baby is waking at night."
3,"Excellent sound machine, poor clock display","I got Conair Sound Machine for my second baby and Wow! the white noise makers have gone a long way!!! It has all sorts of ""noises"". I noticed that my new baby likes the sound of running water and Conair has several variations: rainfall, waterfall, running stream, all very soothing (of course, in addition to all the other sounds it makes).The controls are very easy to use too.However, the clock is poorly designed. I had to angle the whole thing with props, so that I could see the time. Now I don't even bother with that and just use it for the sounds. I am using my good old alarm clock. So, I would recommend buying a cheaper version of this sound machine, the one that just does sounds, without the clock.Also, the clock display has a bright blue background which I actually like (works like nightlight) but some people might be bothered by it."
2,good as a noise maker,"This clock/radio sound relaxer is fine for a nice white noise or other noise options. I sleep very well with the tone. It sounds just like there's a fan blowing, or the setting of water flowing is very relaxing too. However, as a timepiece I find it worthless. I can't even read the clock because of the weird indigo color. Great as a soothing noise machine though, and not as expensive. It's worth the price for the sound quality alone."
2,"Sounds Fine, Clock Horrible","This functions fine as a sound machine, but its display is terrible. The backlight is really bright, and the numbers are impossible to read from any angle except straight ahead (meaning you can't position the clock a little above or below your head). When it operates on battery power alone, you can't see the time at all. It's also really tricky to turn off an alarm function if you accidentally turn one on."
2,opposite,"I bought this a month or so ago...and it is already starting to malfunction. It started crackling loudly in the middle of the night, which wakes me up. So it does the exact opposite of what it is supposed to do. It is supposed to make soothing noises to sleep to, but now I don't want to turn it on because i am afraid it is going to crack loudly in the middle of the night and scare me and wake me up.I may have just gotten a bad one though. Before it malfunctioned, it worked well."
1,Ridiculous sounds!,"Just ordered this and returned it the next day! The sounds are completely ridiculous. I can't believe anyone would actually feel this is worth the money even though it's a less expensive model then some others. There wasn't one except the basic white noise setting that we thought was okay to sleep with. The heartbeat is just weird, not womb sound like most baby heartbeats are. The ocean waves sounds like enormous waves crashing, light to very, very loud sound. The one we have for our 1st born is great but no longer made. Just ordered a Marpac and hoping we will be happy with that option."
2,wickedly bright,"I got this mainly for the sound features, thankfully I don't need the alarm clock because the few times I've tried to use it, I was completely stumped on how to set it. I can figure out almost anything electronic in a matter of minutes, this one has me baffled.The blue light is garishly bright, even on the low setting. The sounds are ok, I like the variety but you can definitely hear a loop. They're acceptable for occasional use, I probably use it once a week or so for a nap. Also some of the sounds don't sound as you would expect. Sometimes I have to go lean over going ""that's what they think a babbling brook sounds like?!"" very odd.On the whole, I would not buy a homedics clock again strictly based on the blue they use for the clock faces, red should be the only color any alarm clock can use. No blue, no green. The blue emits like a bright night lite. I usually have to cover it with a wash cloth, but I'm thinking of permanently taping over it, that's how bad it is."
1,"bad clock radio, useless sound therapy",I bought this clock radio ignoring the warning from other reviewers about the clock is impossible to see in the dark. I try the sound therapy on my infant because she have a hard time to sleep and stay sleep but it did not help. I want to return it but too lazy and it is sitting in a junk box in my garage
1,Conair SU7 Clock,I will never buy this clock again. I like it the day I got it. On the third day my son pushed one of the sound buttons and I couldn't get it to turn off or change to another sounds. I unplugged it and when plugging it back in I hit the radio button and the same thing happened. Tried to use it for a week and ended up buying a different clock when the alarm didn't go off two morning in a row and I was late.
1,Misleading features,"Although this product is featured for restful sounds for slumber time....one of the features(listed in the owners manual)says..""Songbirds: Wake to the sound of birds singing."" That sure indicated to me that one or all of the listed sounds could be used as an alarm, wouldn't you agree? Sorry to say the ONLY sound possible is..or was in my case...the clocks default sound. Conair support was of no assistance, so the item is being returned."
3,Not suitable for sleeping,"When our old sound machine broke, my wife & I purchased the Conair SU7 after a fair amount of research. In general, the design/layout is very nice. Unfortunately, we discovered that none of the sounds was suitable for sleeping.A noticeable irritation was that the white noise, which sounded fine while laying on your back, had a rhythmic ""beat"" while laying on your side. This made it virtually impossible to sleep with the machine on."
3,"great to start, big problems later","We bought this sound machine for our baby, and it has helped her sleep very well for the last 5 months However, 5 out of the last 7 nights, I have been woken up because the sound machine stopped working and made this awful, VERY loud beeping in the middle of the night. It works again if I turn the power off and then back on again, resuming the noise I want. It's a mixed bag, works for a while and then this starts. I would probably not buy this product again, and search another company's options."
1,Not a fan,"My husband bought me this clock because he was tired of my very loud old alarm clock (I get up super early). The sound is fine, as far as alarms go, but I cannot see the time on the readout unless I'm directly in front of it! I'm surprised no one else mentioned this. For this reason, alone, I give it only one star. Currently shopping for a replacement."
3,Rather Large and very low fi,"This clock radio has an extremely bright display. You will not need a nite-lite with this clock. It is extremely large. The price is inexpensive so I did not think that the sound would be anything but subpar and that is the case. The radio is very hard to dial in, but once you get the station you are good to go. The background noise generators are very disturbing in quality so that anything above just barely being able to hear it is irritating. The alarm interface is difficult since there are so many buttons on the top of the radio you are not sure what buttons to use."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"Good service features, however, the blinding blue display is really bad even on the lesser setting.Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless they can reduce the display illumination. Probably one of the reasons that it was a lightning deal.Best regards."
3,not bad for the price,"Great for the price, but two ""issues"" - there should be separate volume controls for the alarm and sound functions - if you set the sound mode a little louder, then the alarm is blaring when it goes off. Also, the sounds are obviously recorded on a loop, with very noticeable noises in between - it can be rather distracting."
4,Great 2 in 1,"Overall I am very happy with this machine/alarm. Its nice that it takes up less space than having a separate alarm clock and sound machine next to the bed. The only bad thing is that if you are a snooze addict like I am, you can only hit snooze 4-5 times. After that you have to shut the alarm off, snooze is no longer an option."
1,Blue Light for an Alarm Clock? What genius thought of that?,Blue light interferes with the production of melatonin. The key hormone involved in helping you fall asleep. What genius thought of putting a blue light on something that is supposed to help you sleep? This clock will keep you awake unless you cover up the light for the time.Check out the pictures I uploaded of the clock showing that you cannot read the time if you are looking straight at or below it. So if you put your alarm clock on a dresser like I do you wont be able to read the numbers. Plus the light is SOOOOO bright it lit up my pitch black room equivalent to what a computer monitor would.
2,Dimmer is EXTREMELY BRIGHT! (High & Low Setting),"The features on this clock are nice, particularly the variety of sounds it offers. But, the dimmer feature on this clock is terrible. First night going to bed, the blue light literally lit up the entire room. Immediately changed it to the ""low"" setting and it didn't make it any better. It was still bright! With the extreme brightness and the funky blue used it made it very difficult to read the time on the clock. Try again Conair!"
4,Conair Su7 Therapy and Relaxation Clock Radio,This is a nice radio with numerous sounds for relaxation. It also has an alarm which is really noisy with more noise to awake a person than what I like. It is a good item for the money.
1,Conair SU7,"It's difficult to set the clock and alarm. The blue light is so bright that I have to turn the clock away from me. And, if I do wake up to see what time it is, the light is so bright I can read it."
2,poor quality...2 units have failed!,"we're on our second one of these, thinking that the first one was just defective. basically, the white noise sounds just stop working...like they're shorting out or something. the second one is doing the same thing, of course this doesn't start until it's too late to send the thing back. i would not recommend this or buy another one."
3,"Nice looking radio, but sounds are very grainy.","This is a nice looking clock radio, but even though it has 10 different sounds, most of them are indistinguishable from one another because of the grainy quality. It is also pretty obvious that they play in a very distinct short loop, rather than seeming to naturally flow. Probably will get more use out of this as a clock radio than as a sound machine."
3,short battery life,after only a couple months of use the battery life for this was drastically reduced. it began to turn itself off after only a few minutes of use & the light was very dim - continues to work fine with ac adapter
1,Can't even read time,"I read past reviews and saw the complaints about people not being able to see screen well. I thought, ""It's 2010. I am sure this company has figured out how to make a digital clock that you can read."" I was wrong. Unless you are standing directly level and in front of clock, it is incredibly hard to red. And although the variety of sounds is appealing, the clock mechanisms vibrates when noise is on and you hear very annoying noise on top of your selected noise (at least when using white noise). Price is what persuaded me to buy it. don't fall for it. Wasted money. Oh - and my 11 month old son somehow pulled the clock off a table and after that 1 thump, clock no longer works. Go to Brookstone if you want a good sound machine - more expensive but lasts for years. This one lasted 1 month for us."
2,"Works, but...","It's a good clock with a reliable alarm, and I like the dual alarm setting. The nature sounds are pretty good-- you can't hear the loop. Two big problems for me, though. One is that the display is BRIGHT. It's bright enough to make a good nightlight, even on the dim setting. I tried putting some window tint film over the display, but it was still so bright I ended up covering it with a cloth at night. The second problem is that the only nature sound that will play on the alarm setting is Running Stream. No matter how many times I've attempted to set a different sound for the alarm, I still get Running Stream. I'm now looking for another nature sounds clock that fits my needs better, particularly my need for a dark room at night!"
3,"Great sounds, bad viewing","I really like all the sounds on this clock, but you really can't see the numbers! However the light is really, really bright, that I need to cover it at night. If you want it for looking at the time, it sucks(which is a major part of having a clock). You have to be right in front of it and look at it at a certain angle. If you just want it for the sounds, it works fine for the price. It replaced the Zen clock, which was way more expensive. For an alarm clock, it works fine (as long as I don't need to look at the time!"
4,sound therapy,I purchased this product approximately one month ago & I have never slept better. I have the ocean waves going all night long & dream of having a beach house. My only complaint is that even on low the dimmer for the time is still bright. I have to turn it away from me but it is quite a nightlight. I would definitely recommend this product. The clarity of the different sounds is really good.
3,"Because of blue screen, can't see the time!","I got this clock for my infant son's room. I was mostly interested in the white noise feature, but of course wanted the clock too. Well, the white noise is fine, but unless you are two feet in front of the clock you can't read the time. The blue screen makes it too difficult to see it at all. I rock my son at night, lights turned off, approximately 4 feet from the clock and can't even make out one number. So if you are looking for a good digital clock, I'd skip this one. Plus, the blue screen is so bright (even on the dimmest setting) that I end up turning it to the wall. I think the old red numbers on black screen are MUCH better. Basically, I should have just bought a white noise machine!"
2,Inexpensive but unusable for adults,"This was the cheapest unit I could find and had good reviews for the most part. But it had 2 flaws that made me return it:1. The blue background display is so bright I had to face the clock away from me and cover it. It literally lit up the room. That of course rendered the clock useless to me. It's a clock radio designed to help you sleep better. Why they would make such a bright display for a bedroom device makes no sense to me. A black background with red letters makes so much more sense for the bedroom, and that technology has been around for decades, so it can't be about cost.2. The sound I cared about the most was the white noise. I assumed that noise would sound like a fan running or something smooth like that. This noise sounded like radio static and was far too harsh to try and sleep through."
2,Barely OK,"The sounds are OK but I can't read the time unless I am looking at it from the side. Which means I end up looking at my husband's clock for the time. I also can't figure out how to set only one alarm on it. The radio is decent enough. I have to put a towel over the display because it is so bright - even on the low light setting. The ""alarm"" choice to wake you is horrible. All in all, I wish I had looked around more before buying this."
1,Dont buy this,This product is terrible. It does not turn off. I have to take the batteries out to turn it off. Most of the other buttons dont work either When I put the battery back in I have to turn one of the mood sounds on and then hit radio to get it to work. Very disappointed.
2,The time display is the worst,"I only have two good things to say about this clock, it keeps time and it has two different alarm time settings. The two alarm times are a great idea. The first bad feature of this clock is that the display is unreadable, as others have stated unless you are up close, directly in front of the clock it is unreadable. I purchased this clock for the sound therapy alarm clock feature. Sad to say as an alarm you only have use of one default therapy sound. Make no mistake the alarm does offer other NOISE as a wake up alarm, but only one therapy sound as an alarm. In my opinion most of the therapy sounds are of poor quality. This is the first clock of this kind that I have ever used. I returned this clock and replaced it a with better clock by Oregon Scientific which cost twice as much, but works ten fold better."
1,NOT for adults - recordings are horrible!,"I sleep SO much better with noise, just white noise, so I thought this sounded good, plus I liked the idea of being able to use the radio in the morning. But the recordings are AWFUL. I wanted to use the rain one but it made this clicking noise every 10 or 15 seconds that drove me crazy. I tried out some of the other sounds but could very quickly identify where they started repeating. And the radio dial is SO TOUCHY that it doesn't stay in one place. I did get theSound Spa Portableby HoMedics (at Bed, Bath and Beyond I think it was $19.99 and then I used a 20% off coupon) and I LOVE it!All this said, Amazon's return process was SO EASY I'll never worry about making a return again!!!!"
3,Great with some design flaws,"I got this about 6 years ago when working the off shift and sleeping during the day. Great for drowning out lawn mowers, kids, etc. Liked it so much I continued to use it all the time and the wife likes it also. Some of the sounds are just not condusive to sleep. I have my fav few that I use and that's it. One big flaw however is the backlight on the clock. It is way too bright even on the low setting. I'm severly dissapointed that the designers have not corrected this. After 6 years I'm getting renegade noises from it randomly and want another but I will not buy it with the same backlight on the clock. For 6 years I've been living with a piece of paper in front of the clock, but no more."
1,Disappointed,"I am not one to complain , but am very dissappointed with this item. This clock lights up like a Christmas tree...way too bright. I use a towel to cover it up at night and have another clock in my room to see the time. I bought this for the purpose of waking up to soothing sounds but I cannot choose the sound I want. I have to settle for the one that it is set to. I would have returned it, but didn't think paying for the shipping to do so was worth it."
2,"Good Sound, but Way Too Bright","I've tried three sound machines so far. The silver Conair one is the best. I got this one to try because I thought it would combine the sound machine and clock, but this display is very bright. At night it glows bright enough to see your way around the room, even on the dim setting! If you angle the clock away from the bed so it's not shining right at you, then you can't see the numbers clearly, so it defeats the point.I'm returning this right now and will stick with a separate clock and the silver Conair sound machine."
3,So-So,"First off this is the second sound therapy machine I was sent. The first one I could not get the clock to set so I sent it back and they sent me another one. The second one came and I tried the clock and once again it would not let me set it. I really needed the sound so I kept it because I wanted it for my 5 year old who is now able to stay asleep during the night due to the sound therapy. If you really need the clock feature do not buy this product, if you just need sound then it is great."
3,Great except for LCD brightness,"The clock and its features are just fine; the background noise is exactly what I wanted. However, the dimmer on the clock is terrible, and the LCD illuminates my entire bedroom. I am still trying to find a way to use this clock without shoving a towel in front of the LCD during the night."
2,Not for me,"This product had some nice features...lots of sounds, interesting appearance but what ultimately make me return it was the poor radio reception. Waking up to a static/music combination does not cut it. And the controls are a little difficult for someone in the dark. And it helps to have previous NASA experience to program this little devil! Other than that, I like it :)"
4,clock feature is extremely hard to see,if I were buying a noise machine I would have given it 5 stars but the alarm clock feature is extremely hard to seeSTILL A GREAT NOISE MACHINE!!
4,Good for what I needed it for,"This is a perfect sound machine. Clock is a bonus, but hard to see the numbers at night."
2,My review of Conair Infant Sound Machine,"It's not loud enough, the power button sometimes doesn't come on, and it's not a very straightforward use."
4,Worth the money.,Overall not bad for the price you pay. I do not like the clockpart of it...too hard to read. The sound part is not the best butit does the trick to drown out background noise around the house.I have slept alot better using it. I rated it with 4 stars becauseit does the job I bought it for.
3,many sound options; clock not visible,"The product has at least 10 different sounds which is nice, however the clock is difficult, if not impossible to read from across the room. The blue background washes out the time display, especially in the dark."
3,good machine when it works,"I bought this for my husband because it had a battery feature. The volume button malfunctioned within a few days of using it. The sound would cut in and out when trying to adjust the volume. It's too bad, because I liked the machine otherwise,and wasn't as expensive as some of the others I've seen."
2,lackluster LCD,You can't view the LCD at an angle. Since we have it up high on a dresser this is a problem.
2,Dissapointed,I purchased this unit to replace an old SU2 unit that I really liked. Here are the things with which I was disappointed:The clock is very difficult to read unless you are looking at it straight and level. Angle viewing while lying in bed is impossible.Radio antenna dangling out the backThe unit is bigger than I expected (I should have checked the size)Sounds with same name are different than the old unitContrast adjustment is crude and not very usefulEven on dim the backlight is fairly bright. On bright you certainly won't need a nightlight in the room.
1,LOW quality,"I tried this out after my sharper image portable cd/soother machine died after 10 years....I guess quality is everything. For it's price, I guess it's not awful. And if you are using it for an infant, to help soothe them to sleep I'm sure it's fine. But as an adult, who has had sleeping problems due to light sleep for my whole life, just horrible. Firstly, it's not loud enough, even at it's highest setting. And #2 and more importantly, you can audibly hear when each sound loop repeats. It';s like a little beep or hum every few seconds. Ridiculous."
4,Not bad,"This serves my needs as I really just wanted white noise to block out street sounds at night. In testing the other sounds, there was a very noticeable and very quick loop. Never used the alarm, can't comment on that. Not a bad price comparitive to all the others out there and I haven't had any problems in the month I've had it. I use it every night."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","I bought this to use as a white noise machine after my other one died after 7 years of use. The white noise function works on this machine, but after only a few weeks of use, the sounds function won't work unless I bang on the top of the machine (possibly a short in the wiring). The clock is also pretty bright at night, even at the ""low contrast"" setting. The machine itself takes up a lot of space. I'll use this for now until I can afford a more expensive and (hopefully) better quality white noise machine."
4,Conair Infant Sound Machine,"I bought this for background noise for my son's room after we turned off the fan when it got too cold. It has several different sounds, but the best one is just White Noise. It is excellent at drowning out the background noise in our house when my son naps or goes to bed at night. I leave it on all night with the volume very low. My only problem is that because it's an alarm clock, the digital display is a little bright, even with the dimmer switch. But I turned it around in his bookcase and it makes a perfect nightlight. Excellent product that I'm sure we'll be using for years to come."
3,Ehh....so so,"I don't like most of the sounds. I use the rainfall or the waterfall and the white noise. All the other noises are too disruptive to sleep to (birds chirping, frogs croaking) and the heartbeat is just creepy. With the noises I do use, I constantly hear weird background noises and clicking when the track repeats itself. However, like anything, you get used to it and it's not too bad. The LED display screen is extremely bright...so bright that I can literally do shadow puppets with it on my ceiling."
2,looping sounds drive me crazy,"This product is a combination alarm clock/radio/noise machine. The clock and radio work fine, but the noises (white noise and many nature sounds) are digital samples of a few seconds in length that are repeated over and over again. So the white noise sounds like a repeating 6-10s loop, and I can't recommend this product for that purpose. I have to turn down our baby monitor because the repeating noise drives me crazy!"
1,"If you want good white noise, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE","These machines have irritating rythmic noise in the background of the white noise selection. It is not theraputic, it's disruptive to sleep. The clock and alarm work fine. The blue light on the display lights up a room like a flashlight. I just cover it. DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP MACHINE!"
4,Conair SU7,"I am hard of hearing, so I can barely hear the sound therapy as it sounds like a small stream flowing over rocks. My wife and my daughter on the other hand, swear by the Conair sound therapy,"
4,Works for white noise,"This does what I want it to: provide white noise for my baby's nursery. However, I also bought it so I could see what time it was when I was nursing overnight and it is extremely hard to see the time unless you are looking at it from a certain angle and up close. I don't think the light from the sound machine is that bad, just a nice glow in an otherwise dark room at night. Also--somehow, I have turned the alarm on (without meaning to) and that has caused an issue during the night a few times and not having the directions anymore, it takes me at least 5 minutes (and having to turn the light on) to figure out how to turn the alarm off.Overall though, I think it's hard to find a sound machine for $25 or less that provides consistent white noise. I am purchasing another one for our new baby because this one has worked well for us and helps my baby sleep."
2,Depends what you want...,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my son, and we are pretty disappointed.When I came into his room this morning, I saw that the clock had been turned to face away from him because it was so bright. In fact, my husband woke up in the middle of the night and thought the light was on - but it was only the too bright display (and that was on the dimmer of the 2 settings!).The soothing sounds all seem to work fine, except that we can't choose which one works with the alarm clock - our primary purpose in buying this clock. The default sound is the running stream, but we would have like the chirping birds. tough luck, I guess. If anyone has advice on how to change this, I'd appreciate it.Other than those two very primary issues, it's been delightful owning this clock for the last day."
5,Does what it needs to do.,"I got this for my wife so she could drown out my snoring. It seems to do just that. She sleeps well now, but all the waterfall and rain noise makes me go to the bathroom. Anyway...It's a great deal for the money paid."
2,Used for a month then went back to old clock,"We like the noisemaker features of the clock, but it is too bright, and there too many buttons on top. I took it apart and put two layers of window tint over the clock because it was too bright. It was still too bright at night, but now too dark during the day to read the time. We've just canned it and gone back to our ancient alarm clock. We'll probably use it when we travel for a noise maker because it is battery powered. Otherwise it'll sit in the closet."
2,clock review,"Good selection of sounds, but terrible time display. Cannot tell the time at night. It is even difficult to see the dsiplay during the day."
2,Way too bright!,"The light coming from this alarm clock is extremely bright, even on the lowest setting. I wouldn't purchase it again for that reason. The big snooze button is a bonus and everything else is good."
2,Conair Sound Therapy Clock Radio,I thought this clock would be a bit smaller. The sound quality is fair to poor. There is some static and crackling and the sound is not consistent. However it is adequate.
1,the power is on but not one button works,"can't change the time, turn on the sleep machine, nothing but it's getting power we know because the face comes on. this store has a difficult return policy where you have to call and get a return number and then return, it's not easy like it is when you get something directly from amazon. i'm too lazy to call so i'll eat the $30 but i do not recomend. i found an app on my phone for $.99 that works perfect."
3,"Very poor clock display, Decent sounds features","So frustrated with this, because it is almost impposible to read the clock. I am not sure if it is the backlight (which you can adjust to high or low), but either setting you just can barely read the clock. Maybe it's the blue backlight, and not so dark numbers?! Not sure, but it is very frustrating. Ii do like the sounds features on the clock however we are white noise people and even on the white noise setting it makes an almost wavy like noise. (not a fan of that), however I will rate this item OK, because I did purchase 2 of them one for each of my babies rooms, and it is working so far. The newborn is no longer waking up my toddler so I am happy with that. I really like the radio feature as well that it is not a dial-type of radio but you can adjust to the actual number digitally. That is a nice feature. In hinesight I would have gone with a different one, but it serves its purpose I suppose."
2,cool idea but...,"I was very excited to receive this product too bad it was not what i expected. The sounds are awful, they sound like they're coming from an old speaker and the display is impossible to see from any direction other than looking at it eye level and straight on. don't waste your money."
2,Can't choose sounds for alarm,"The soothing sounds for going to sleep are nice and work well; you can choose the amount of time (up to 90 min) that you want the sound to play before it turns off. Unfortunately, the alarm is not as good. You can choose between radio, buzzer, and sound, but the only sound that will play for the alarm is the default running stream! Bummer, because that is not a sound that will wake you up. I was looking for an alarm with a gentler sound to wake up to than a radio or buzzer, but this isn't it. I don't understand why they would not allow you to choose the alarm sound. Disappointed."
4,A great little machine.,This Conair sound machine / radio works great. We had a wind storm recently and it did a pretty good job of drownding the noise out.
1,Dimmer Dilemma,"I asked for this product for Christmas and got it. I wanted it for the sounds plus to see the time as needed during the night. The dimmer switch does not dim the bright blue window light. It goes from bright to brighter. I want the room dark. I have to cover the clock window which defeats the purpose of the clock. It is useless for me and I keep having to replace clocks. It is fine for those who want a night light in a room. It was purchased on EBay and the seller has not responded to the buyers return request since they already got good feedback... we are guessing. Only a few of the sounds are soothing and natural sounding. I do like the sounds. Both tropical and song birds buttons sound about the same. Now, I have to find a new clock, again. Frustrating...:("
3,Does not work as well as i would have liked.,My husband only listens to one of the sounds and sometimes it goes out and has to be restarted. And it usually happens in the middle of the nite.
4,Display is only thing that keeps this from being perfect,"This is absolutely a great sound machine and alarm clock. For the money I don't know of anything that will beat it. My only issue is with the display. It is BRIGHT as previous reviewers have mentioned, but the downside is that it is difficult to read at all angles. It is unreadable if your eyes are at or below the display. It sits next to my bed on a nightstand that is higher than my head when I'm lying down. I had to raise my head up to read the time. I solved the problem by putting a book under the back of the unit so that the display angles down.Also, I could never find the dimensions of the unit. FWIW it is roughly 8""x6""x2-3/4"""
4,Great sound options!,"I love everything about the sound machine except one thing. I do wish there was one setting lower for the light on the display. There is a low and high but even the low seems very bright at night. However, if you or your child likes a nightlight it would be perfect. Overall I'm very happy with it!"
5,The best sound machine on the market!,"This sound machine is perfect for puting our son to sleep! It has the perfect balance between volume and sound quality to adapt in any environment. Whether you're watching a late-night movie, or you have guests over for a party, this sound machine will block-out most noise which would normally awaken our boy in a startle. I highly recommend this unit over all others which are more expensive. The others don't have sufficient volume and they feel like they will break in your hands if you hold them incorrectly. Believe me, the Conair Infant Sound Machine - SU7 is the way to go!!"
4,Conair Infant Sound Machine,"I was delighted with the sound choices and the radio. My one complaint was that the clock read-out is very difficult to see and makes it hard to set the alarm. The light is a little too bright, which disturbs my sleep. I have to cover the light."
3,"Nice sounds, but a little bright...","The sounds are good, and the price was great. My only complaint is that the clock is very bright. Nearly lights the entire room, even on the dim setting. If you are okay with that its a great product."
3,works OK,"Cheaply made, though, like most things these days! Got it for my son. I like that it has 2 alarms, and the buzzer beeps increasingly loud. One of the buttons stopped working right. Have to press over & over pretty hard before alarm turns on/off."
2,cheap quality,"I sleep with a fan for white noise. I had always wondered whether a sound machine would work better. Maybe, but not this one. The sounds are okay, but the buttons occasionally choose not to work, making it impossible to change the sounds or even turn the power off. I have given it to my daughters who are willing to sleep with it on one setting, but I could not sleep with it on. I would not buy this one again."
2,Turns off on its own,"I've purchased 2 of these machines. One lasted 1 month and the other lasted 1 year. They both began to turn off on their own - without anyone touching any buttons. Also, the buttons began to stop working. For instance, when I would press power numerous times nothing would happen. I did love the white noise sound while it lasted for my baby."
2,Not for me,"If you are looking for an alarm clock that will allow you to wake up to a natural sound, this is not the right product for you. The sounds are very nice and I'm sure, as a sound machine (its primary purpose) it's a great product. That said- I had a natural sounds alarm clock that needing replacing and purchased this assuming I could choose which sound I woke up to. Not the case. It was set up to default to the ""running stream"" sound when you choose ""sound"" as your alarm. So if your primary reason for making this purchase is an alarm clock that plays natural sounds- look elsewhere.My major disappointment with this product too is that this is not clear in the description. It promotes ten different sounds. I expected to have some choice."
1,Item was dead on arrival,Item did not work. It's poorly produced. Cusotmer service said they would ship me another one. I never got the replacement unit. Called their service a few months later and they told me at that time that it was out of warranty and I had failed to ship them my old unit. They never asked me to ship my old unit and now I'm left with a failed unit and nothing else to do.
3,"Decent, however","The clock does exactly what it says it does. It has a decent radio, plays the sound therapy sounds (and will play them till you turn them off), has two alarms (which can be set to use an alarm, one of the sounds, or the radio), it has a near useless contrast button.All of that works fine, however, unless you're looking directly at the clock at eye level, you'll have a hard time seeing the time. It's similar to looking at a cheap display on a laptop. If you set the clock on a dresser that sits 2 feet above where your head lays, you won't be able to see the time on the display. Same thing if you set it on a table too low, the display just won't work unless you're looking directly at it at eye level.Other than that, the thing appears to function exactly as it should."
3,Decent sound machine - unreadable clock,"Pros: Nicely recorded sounds. Quick-set sleep timer feature is great (easily sets to 15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 minutes - fantastic for baby's naptime). Digital readout for radio makes it easier to tune in the station you want.Cons: Way too bright clock display - it doubles as a night light in my daughter's bedroom. I would never use it in my own bedroom. Despite it being bright, the clock is completely unreadable, but I knew this before I purchased from the other reviews.I would buy this product again if I just needed a white noise/sound machine. If you want to use it as your main alarm clock too, I'd keep looking."
2,If you don't need to see the time!,"I HATE leaving a bad review. I try to be fair. But this clock is full of design flaws. Yes the ""sound therapy"" is cool - but that is about as far as it goes. Believe me! You can not see the time! Not at any setting, unless you strain and turn it at the perfect angle!! I Hate that about it. I thought I would be able to glance over in the middle of the night and see the time, but it is nearly impossible without strain. The off/on/snooze/sounds buttons are all very small, and right next to all the other buttons! I am looking for a new clock."
1,Worst Clock Radio EVER!!!!!,"Don't even waste your time buying this.....matter of fact you don't even need to read this. Absolutely the worst clock radio I have ever had. Little 1-4 inch travel size clocks work better, look better, and sound better. The sound therapy is atrocious and whoever designed this clock should be banned. The display is troublesome because you have to stare straight into with no variation in angle or height. In the picture it looks to be white but it comes out of the box an old, almost dirty, brownish tint of white. Overall this is just a terrible item and should be taken off of Amazon. Thank you."
1,Clock did not function,"I ordered this clock for my daughter and she was very excited to receive. The problems came in when we plugged it in. The buttons seemed to stick so although you pressed them, there was no response. Also it would not keep the time."
1,Doesn't work,"This item doesn't work for my baby, so I tried to use it as an alarm clock/radio but the light on the clock made it so hard to see the time. Not a good item."
3,a little cheap but it's ok,For the price this isn't bad. The noises aren't the best and it's a bit cheap looking/sounding. I'll probably look for another sound machine & use this for the clock
1,Should have listened to the reviews,"No, you can't see the time from almost any angle. The screen is way too bright and will bother you from sleeping.I didn't know what some reviewers meant when they said they started hearing some other sounds in the background, but now I do. When you listen to the sounds for a while, they seem to start forming patterns that sound like words. Definitely weird.But the worst part... I got this to help my daughter sleep. But sometimes the machine would just stop abruptly, waking her up. :( Other times, it would switch sounds randomly. Or even switch to the radio! I kept the radio between stations so when it would turn on randomly, my daughter would still hear static, not people talking. Such a useless piece of junk. Straight to the garbage it went."
2,"New, and unimproved ...","The illustration does not show the flimsy single wire FM antenna, about 3 feet long or so that sprouts from the back. With it reception goes from poor to fair. The predecessor of this product, which I liked, was actually better than this successor. The front lighting as others as noted is switchable only from ""too bright for night"" to ""slightly less annoying."" The sound is okay. The battery operation solo is good for travel. I wouldn't buy this one again. In fact, this may be heading to the Goodwill."
2,I can't see the time!,"The blue display makes seeing the time almost impossible, especially in the middle of the night. During the day, I have to walk within 3 feet of it to see what time it is. Very frustrating!!"
2,"The sounds are great, but the display is awful","We bought this clock to use in our baby's room, to provide white noise instead of using a fan. The sounds are great, but unless you are at the right level you cannot see the time. It's awful. Who would have thunk that you can't see the time on a clock unless you have it at the right height? Crazy. It will be going back."
3,"Cheap sound, not relaxing at all","I ordered this alarm clock based on the claims of good quality sound. It was a less expensive alternative, and I figured I would try it. Shipping and packaging were very good, and the unit worked out of the box. However, the sound quality is pretty bad. The sounds were not realistic nor soothing, and I ended up turning the sounds off completely so I could sleep. As an alarm clock, this unit works just fine. As a relaxation aid or white noise machine, you can do much better."
2,Nice but way to bright.,"Sounds are good, liked the overall look, but this thing is like having floodlamps in the bedroom. The dimmer adjust has little effect so if you like a dark room for sleep do not get this. I put it back in the box and I'll look for someone to give it to."
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks.,"We purchased this unit and it worked for about 6 weeks, and then only the radio and clock worked. The sounds wouldn't come on and the alarm couldn't be set. It was too late to return to Amazon, so I was going to use the 1-year warranty from the Conair Corp. I was supposed to send $5 and ship it to them. The shipping was going to cost $15, so I would have more than the original cost of the unit. I called the toll free number I obtained from Amazon, but they said there was nothing more they could do, except perhaps waive the $5.00 shipping fee they charge. I expect items to work longer than 6 weeks, and I expect better customer service assistance. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this, and I will never purchase another conair appliance of any kind."
3,"display doesn""t light up on batteries only","It's small and cute, and I like the sounds, and the radio, but the display for the clock does not light up unless it's plugged in, and the cord is a nuisance. ~ Everthing works on the batteries only except the display light, which sucks."
3,Heed Other Reviews,"I was very excited to get this little machine because I wanted one that was a sound machine and alarm clock combination so that there wasn't a lot of clutter on my nightstand. Unfortunately I found that other customer reviews were right on target in regards to the time display. It is quite bright, so if that bothers you then you will have to wear a sleep mask. Also you cannot read the time from more than 5 feet away. It also must be exactly at eye level in order to read the time. If your nightstand is slightly higher than the level of your bed as mine is, you will have issues. The sounds are excellent though and the radio works well. It was not difficult to set the alarm and there are three options (buzzer, radio or sounds) After using it for the first time last night and listening to sounds of ocean waves I was able to fall asleep quickly. However, I will be returning it and looking at the Homedics versions of this machine."
5,Can not live without it!,"We purchased this sound machine for our newborn baby girl on the advice of other parents who used sound machines. We love this one! The time display glows at night so you can easily see it when you are giving those late night feedings. The battery back up is great so you can unplug it and take it with you when you travel and don't have to reset the clock! We like the ""waterfall"" sound the best and our daughter sleeps so peacefully now through any noise! We've had this machine for over 4 months now and have had no problems with it. Hight recommended!"
3,"Useless clock, good sounds, great option to run on batteries","Great soothing/background sounds for light sleepers. The clock function, however, is useless. The display is way too bright--bright enough that I was able to take the night light out of my daughter's room. The worst part is that even though the display is so bright, you can't read what time it is because the contrast is so bad!Overall, I still give the unit 3 stars because I'm happy with the sound options and the size of the unit.I LOVE the fact that you can use the unit with batteries. That is a HUGE plus if you (or your kids) are used to falling asleep to white noise and there happens to be a power failure!"
4,great white noise and clock radio,"This is a great little machine that blocks out snorers and other noise while you rest. The only problem is the brightness of the display, even with its dimmer it has to be covered. As long as you cover it, the machine is just great!"
3,Disappointed,"The concept is great and the sounds do what they are supposed to do. They are realistic. But on most of the 10 different sounds, I hear secondary sounds in the background unrelated to what is supposed to be heard. I hear a series of clicks that are distracting. It is being used continuously through out the night. The clock radio was not used regularly but when it was turned on, it was just fine. The machine was bought specifically for the sound machine portion based on the reviews online. I would definitely buy another sound machine for that purpose but not this particular model."
3,Not as good as I hoped,I was really hoping this would block out the rest of my family when I want to go to sleep early and they want to watch tv. Unfortunately the volume doesn't work well and the channels keep wavering. The blue backlight is extremely bright and I have to put something in front of it to block the light. Kinda defeats the purpose that I bought it for.
2,"Bright, poor sounds, difficult to control","The display is super bright in a dark room. The buttons are poorly laid out making it difficult to set alarms, or turn off your alarm. The interface is not intuitive at all and you will be racking your brain remembering how to change an alarm or set the time. You can actually hear the looping points in most of the sleep sounds."
3,compact - but cheezy sounding,"I got this because my old Timex combo radio/soothing sounds device quit producing the sounds - just radio now. The Timex sounded alot better, but wasn't as compact - so all in all, I'm glad I got it."
3,"Ok sound machine, bad radio","Some of the sounds sound like nothing but static, it is not useable as a radio because it's so difficult to find (and keep) a radio station. I like that you can set when it will go off. If you find a sound you like, it will work wonders."
1,Piece of crap,"The fm radio range is from 104.9-154.9???!! So the radio feature is totally unusable. I'm a former pilot and I've heard local aircraft radio calls on it. Cool except that it is supposed to help my newborn sleep. It catches these calls while it's set to white noise. If you view it from above, for example while standing, it's impossible to see what time it is. The sounds often get stuck. If the white noise didn't sort of work I would have returned it. I'm just sick of buying and throwing away white noise machines."
4,Great for intended purpose,"I give 5 stars for the sounds therapy aspect. It has a very clear and soothing sound. I use the sound therapy for my 2 yr olds nap and bedtime. However, I give the radio aspect almost 3 stars. I didn't realize it came with nearly 2 feet of wire antennae, which is too much work finding the right reception for each radio station. But I got it for the sound therapy, and it's fantastic for that purpose."
2,the sounds are not very clear,I really enjoy listening to the nature but the sounds are not very sharp. I wish they cold have made the sounds sharp
1,"Can't See Clock Numbers, Buttons Too Small","This is terrible. The buttons are too small and the power button looks like all the other buttons so it is difficult to find. I bought this because I had been using the other Conair sound machine and thought this was a great idea that they added a clock, but the clock is useless because you have to be standing at just the right angle to see the numbers. So if you need your sound machine to have a night light, that is about all the clock is good for. I would recommend buying theConair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silverinstead of this one with the useless clock."
2,"Love the sound, can't see the time display.","The selections on the sound machine - great. Sound for the radio- great.Unfortunately, you cannot read the time display. The blue is so bright, the numbers are difficult to discern.Very disappointed in this.I wish the display were a wonderful as the sound machine!!It also has a great alarm clock!If you're not too bothered by not being able to read the time, this is a great sound machine!"
5,Excellent sound machine,We purchased this to replace an old Conair sound machine which is identical to this without the clock. we had used it for several years and the volume control was starting to get scratchy and hard to adjust. We are very pleased with this device and a clock and radio are an added plus. The price for this on Amazon was half what we paid for the other one which did not have a clock or radio. You just can't beat an Amazon deal like this.
3,Too bright.,The sound mechanism is great - but the blue light -even at its lowest setting - is way too bright for bedroom use.
3,My Baby's Wind Machine,"It does not serve as a clock. You cannot see the time (only if you catch the clock in a certain light (or lack there of)). We purchased this for a wind machine for our baby while she sleeps (we're loud) and it works. The wind is a bit quiet, but she doesn't react to our laughing or talking. For the price try it for the noise only NOT FOR A CLOCK!!!!!"
1,Conair Infant sound machine,"Probably fine for a baby, but I got this for myself and gave the good one to my son to sleep with. You definitely get what you pay for. The light is really bright and kind of annoying at night, so I end up facing it towards the wall. The sounds that play are ok, but the white noise one has some weird sound recorded in with it so I end up focusing on that and not being able to sleep. And if I turn it up too loud, the speaker goes out completely. If I could do it over again, I probably would have paid more money for a better sound machine.update 3/4/10- this thing is a piece of junk. the sound doesn't work anymore. don't waste your money!"
5,Great for prepping you for the barre!,"What a fun, energizing workout! I love Tracey and I do her BOOTY BARRE DVDs (Total Body and BB Plus) a couple of times a week. I think this is a great workout to prepare you for Barre workouts. The time flies by and before you know it, the hour is up. The first half is a dance based workout. She explains things clearly and goes over the steps with you so no worries if you have no dance experience. The second workout is a floor barre routine. So, basically moves that you would do at a ballet barre, but instead, on the floor. This adds a different type of challenge vs if you were standing up. So, think Pilates on the floor. The second workout encompasses the whole body while the first workout is mostly cardio and legs/abs. Give this DVD a shot, you wont regret it!"
2,Matter of convenience?,"I ordered this along with a 3gang wall plate (2 decora and 1 standard switch) and an automatic timer switch and wanted this ""blank"" to fill the middle switch since I would be consolidating 2 switches into one with the timer switch. After getting this blank, I found it near impossible to fit my Levaton wall plate without a little filing around the corners and top/bottom. Besides that, it causes my wall plate to bow out a little since both switches on the outer ends sit flush. After a run to the local hardware store for something else, I found a Levaton blank for under $3."
3,Not bad,"a bit smaller than i pictured...more length than width added over regular trojans. Look elsewhere if you're looking for something a bit roomier, but still much more comfortable than other trojans."
3,"They held up nicely. Although, they seemed to ...","They held up nicely. Although, they seemed to be a bit too thick, therefore I lost some sensation. I like Trojan brand in general, maybe just not this one."
4,Finallly! A condom that fits comfortably,"I bought these after overlooking them for sometime, due to brand loyalty. Other manufacturers produce ""larger"" varieties, but Trojan nailed it. Although I wish Magnums came in a ""thinner"" model, these do not feel as if they're going to break on me with every thrust and every grind. Comfort counts. Remember: no matter your disposition, practice safe sex!"
5,Magnum Condom Review,Very comfortable fit. Enough room and not binding at all. I recommend these to all above average guys.
4,"As far as condoms go, these feel as ...","As far as condoms go, these feel as good as all the others. Were dying to try out some """"specialty"""" condoms, like the inSpiral."
2,"In this case ""revised"" means changed to much.","I didn't know that revised could mean to leave things out. I purchased this book because I lost the original one. Well, this one is not just revised it is changed so that the very things I was trying to find where no longer in the book. What a disappointment."
1,all 70s haircuts BEWARE rip off!!!!!!!!,would be a good book if we were in the 70s I felt ripped off
3,Last Minute Artist and Track Change??,"I haven't even listened to the album yet. I just walked in the door with it and opened it to find Anthony B with Luciano instead of Sizzla. They still have Sizzla on the cover and title listing on Amazon and all the tracks (even the Luciano tracks). What's up with that? As far as I can tell, Penitentiary records does not even have a website. I have no problem with Anthony B, but I was expecting Sizzla. Needless to say, it is a bit of a let down. We'll see how it sounds tonight. Hopefully it is some of Anthony B's better material...Just be aware that Sizzla is not on this album!"
5,Deep In Your Soul,"This is one of those albums that maybe your girlfriend/boyfriend just dumped you,you want to listen to it but at the same time you don't 'cause you get nasty goosebumps and wanna just cry your heart out,what a poet!!W Lucio Dalla"
2,Bitter disappointment,"I have read this book and agree with most of the other reviewers. As an avid elfquest fan, I was disappointed by the the art - it doesn't possess the quality of the Elfquest legacy. The art is substandard and embarrassing for Elfquest. The story, too, is mediocre. There is too much jumping around, holes in the plot, and departures from characters. The actions of the characters just seem out of sync with the other elfquest stories - did someone other than the Pinis write it? Of course I bought this since I am a fan and stupidly bought Phoenix, which is even worse than this one! EQ fans beware."
1,Not even worth vomiting for...,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If I could give it less than one star, I would! This is the most abyssmal book I have ever owned and I ashamed to have it sitting on my bookshelf. In the case of a power outtage, it is the first thing I will burn! If you love elfquest, then you will hate this...that Wendy and Richard even published it destroys my faith in their integrity and makes me very skeptical of future releases. This is the most hackneyed, untalented, uninspired, unbelieveable and nauseating book I have ever read! (and I've read a lot of stinkers) If you want EQ, read the Hidden Years graphic novel or Dreamtime...don't waste your time on this."
1,Ungodly . . .,"I remember reading these in full color and they weren't all that great then, but now this story has turned into a virtual eyesore. If you can actually get past the goof ball grinning faces and the faded ink look of the book, you will find that the story is mediocre at best. There are a few good moments, but as a whole, the story suffers greatly because the artist's work does not do well in black and white. Once again, I ask, what the hell happened to EQ? Barry Blair should not have been allowed to skew EQ in this fashion because it too closely resembles his dark elf series which, for the lack of a better word, is just bad.Be warned, reader. This is yet another sign of the slow and agonizing demise of EQ."
3,"good info, but lacks technique","Book was good as my first book to understanding the painting types but lacked procedure. Book kind of jumps around a bit, not so much of a step by step or straight-forward approach. Does discuss safety, gun types, shop setup, paint systems(single stage vs. base coat/clear coat)metal and plastic prep procedures, but the author did ramble unnecessarily too much.Just lacked overall concentration of the painting procedure itself."
5,Great knife,"I just put in a order today. This will be the third identical knife I have bought. I love this knife! It is tough and really cool to look at. I got my first one in 2005 and then lost it in 2010, it held up great, the action was smooth, I could flick it open with ease and it was still rock solid. I'm not a ranch hand or construction worker that depends on this knife to get me through my work day. I am most certainly a weekend warrior of the outdoors, camping, hiking, fishing, cliff diving, kayaking, boating, bonfires, all of it. One time I was in a pich and I opened a can of spaghettios with this knife. The spaghettios can did scratch off some of the black coating on the blade but it kept its edge well and nothing else was damaged. It is a solid knife and I have it in my pocket all the time."
4,Great Support,"I bought this knife used from a junk store about 12 years ago and always, literally, carried it with me and used it several time a day until its blade finally began to loosen to a point that it could not be tightened, and the plastic housing around the blade began to disintegrate in my pocket. I knew that Gerber had a lifetime warranty, so I sent ""my buddy"" off with a letter explaining the problem. Today, (4 weeks later) I just received ""son of buddy"" in the mail. I am, once again, a happy camper, and will shout the praise of Gerber's overall quality (though they are, disappointingly, now made in Taiwan) and their outstanding product support (I did notice, reading the fine print, that you must now produce a sales slip or proof of purchase to receive warranty coverage). I guess I'm screwed next time."
4,A good book,"Keres was considered to be a master of attack, and in this book he proves it. Most of the games are very entertaining miniatures in which Keres focuses more on themes and plans, rather than variations. There is also a section on endgames which are also interesting. Not very instructive, but very entertaining."
4,Why can't they host the Oscars?,"French & Saunders, where Ab FAb came from, is the source of some of the funniest things I've ever seen. These dvds, while making reference to some British cultural references you won't understand, have some of the best parodies and sketch comedy ever. The Lord of the Rings parody is oscar-worthy itself. Dawn French is just amazingly funny all the time and makes me wonder why her or Ms. Saunders haven't made it here yet. Some times they are way off the wall and I think some skits are more for their own enjoyment than that of the audience, which can be a bit trying at times. Another classic however is the Rock Opera, with a great rendition of ""I Should be so Lucky"". These are not to be missed."
2,Awful. Sending them back,"Absolutely zero mid-range. Tapping my foot on the floor produces more bass than the subwoofer, even with it jacked to max.Incredibly disappointed."
1,static city,The subwoofer puts out a lot of static on all inputs. Something is not right with this model.
1,Why did they translate this?,"I like Tintin so I thought this might be an interesting gift for some young friends of mine. Unfortunately, the Tintin characters that decorate here and there have nothing to do with the text. Then on top of that, the book is shallow and ignorant of it's topic. It's treatment of Islam is particularly poor. Islamic law is Sharia, not Charia. It uses stereotypes of 'fundamentalists' and 'holy war' that would offend many Muslims. Muslims don't worship some strange god called Allah. Allah is the Arabic name for God, the same as the God of Moses and Jesus. It also said that all the idols in Mecca were destroyed but the black stone, as though the black stone is an idol of sorts, which is incorrect. My young friends are Muslim so I couldn't give them such a book and for religious understanding, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else."
5,Brilliant,"Very decently set up book with tremendously clear photographs of all the stuff you want to see. Especially when working with difficult parts it's very nice to be sure what you're doing. A real recommendation, this book, for everyone who enjoys keeping their Triple in top shape!"
2,Comfortable but annoying and poor quality,"Comfortable ear cups.Cumbersome and flimsy mic boom.Annoying flashing lights on wire.USB interface is annoying. You cannot plug in after executing game or they don't work.I cut the chip out and soldered two 1/8"" phono jacks on to bypass the USB interface. Not a recommended product."
1,Poor,"I bought one USB headset from Genius (Genius HS-04U), but I returned it next day to shop, because I didnt hear the deep voices, the bass is missed from music and from games.I dont understand, how can this product got Dolby certificate.Anyway, very comfortable product."
3,My Review on The Raggedy Ann and Andy Adventures !,I find one great story on the Mabbit adventures and other exciting taleswas Mabbit adventure ! the basic adventure story but Raggedy Ann wasupdated look in this carttoonthen the 1944 verson of her in Suddenly It's spring and Enchanted Square !
3,BBC Recordings,"Not a totally essential Hogs collection, but not bad either. BBC live in the studio cuts from Thank Christ For The Bomb through Hogwash era, plus some live concert tracks from a Hogwash tour show."
4,Workers of the World Unite,"I received this book as part of the Friends of AK Press membership (something anyone into these kinds of books should look into), and it was well worth it. Brinton's main strength as a writer is his keen sense of observation, his clarity and his willingness to destroy the party line. He's not afraid to call things as he sees them, which I'm sure bothers Communists and Socialists to no end.One of the most compelling parts of the book his reports on Paris, 1968. It's almost like you are there with him as the crowds take to the streets. It's well worth buying just for that alone, because even if you know the history behind that May event, you've never read it like this.Political junkies, anarchists, Socialists and Communists need to buy this and then ready themselves to get educated."
4,A simple and much enough contents for everyone,"Membrane proteins have many typical characters that are very different from other water-soluble proteins. You can learn almost about topics of the membrane protein simply. This book is constructed with two big chapters and first chapter gives explanations about general strategies and techniques about purification (choice of protein sources, solubilization techniques, etc.), chromatography (hydroxylapatite, ion-exchange, chromatofocusing, metal chelate, affinity, covalent, hydrophobic, gel filtration, etc.) and electrophoresis(denaturing, native gel). In second chapter, several examples of membrane proteins were reported. Each purification procedures were detailed and you will be able to understand step by step. This book covers totally about practical membrane protein science and will be a nice guide for beginners as well as experts."
2,Wanna eat teflon?,"I bought this wok, and within 3-weeks the teflon was coming off. I only used plasic utensils to cook with it, but even so. Don't waste your money unless teflon is on your menu."
4,Region 1,Still waiting on a region 1 release of A Taste of Honey for the United States. We have strict anti-copyright laws here--so I don't want to hear all that other nonsense about do this or do that. Just release the film in a region 1 format.
5,5 stars,arrived safe and sound in good order and before the time stated . always a good experience with amazon uk
1,Money Grubbing Vendor,"I inquired about ""A Taste of Honey"" for sale from rare cinema, to make sure it was exactly the edition I was looking for (the full BFI DVD with commentary). Per the seller's response it was indeed the copy I was looking for. However, after receiving a reply to my inquiry, I went back to my shopping cart to purchase it and discovered that rare cinema had raised the price by almost $40.00. Coincidental to my inquiry? I sincerely doubt it. I wouldn't do business with them now under any circumstances!"
3,"Not a bad case, not great either","This isn't a bad case for the Panasonic FZ7, but as other reviewers said, it could be better. I don't mind so much that it doesn't have it's own strap, but I do wish there were some small pockets on the outside (if only to put things like memory card cases or something). I wasn't looking for a huge camera case that could hold lots of extras, just something light to protect my camera from getting wet/damaged so this works just fine."
2,It holds the camera...,This case is basically a camera cover. It uses the camera's strap and it has no pockets or space for anything besides the camera. I use a slightly larger case that can hold an extra battery and a few other things instead of this.
1,You can do better,"If it were 1/2 inch taller you could keep the lens hood on in the use position. The small pocket in the bottom side is poorly designed. It will hold one battery, that's all. There is room for a larger pocket that would have held a filter and maybe a couple of batteries.There are a couple of loops on the top sides with snaps to open that you could use a strap on. You can use the camera strap but what do you do with the bag when you are using the camera? It seems too bulky to use it on a belt. It is time consuming to put the camera in the bag with the strap on as you need to find a place to stuff it.Over all I think it is poorly designed and grossly overpriced."
3,Case is tight on space,I purchased this case for FZ18 with the length of the lense although this case is marked for this camera the Camera just barely fits. I would have preferred one a little larger.
2,Too costly for serious backup,"This product may be fine for the home user with small infrequent backups. But with LTO2 drives starting at $1500 and 200GBnative/400GBcompressed tapes costing $35 each, the cost of the media will quickly overwhelm the savings in the drive for any larger/more frequent backup routine. This format is far too costly for archive media as well.Iomega has been trying for years to create another winner like the Zip drive, but they've failed to recognize it's been done with DVD-R and soon with HDDVD/Blu-Ray. There simply isn't a need for a high priced product like this. If the units were $100 and the media were $10, they'd have a chance."
5,Just what I was looking for.,Restoration Hardware used to sell a shower curtain rod with these holders at the end. This was a great product for an oversized opening and the ends look much better than the pre-packaged shower rods. So happy to have found these.
5,Bottle Cap,Clearly Charming Coca Cola Bottle Cap Italian CharmThe caps are neatly made and so colorful. A very nice selection. They are the best.
3,BEAUTIFUL but one flaw,"This is a fantastic way to display all my husband's Navy medals & awards. It's unfortunate that the very slightly larger/thicker retirement flag doesn't fit in here though...disappointing. Now I have to buy some random cheap-o flag to put in here and display the one that actually means something to him seperately in another case, increasing clutter.If they used a more sturdy backing material and sturdier clips to hold it on, his flag would fit, but they cheaped out on the backing which is practically balsa wood, and the clips are regular bendable cheap frame clips which are too short to fasten the back on if there is something bulky in the case."
2,MADE IN CHINA,"Received the colonial shadow box with flag today, quick delivery. The shadow box was nice, had a finger print on the Plexiglas, but that is no problem. Since I am satisfied with the box I am not sending the order back. What I have a big problem with is the flag. The first thing I seen when opening the package with the flag in it was a sticker that reads ""MADE IN CHINA"". The flag made a faster than the speed of sound into my trash can. An American vet displaying a flag made in china NOPE. You don't get a 5 star rating from me."
5,Excellent Sound,"This is a short but low priced CD of The Hollies hits and better tracks from Imperial Records before they went to Epic. January 1966 thru July 1967. Window, Bus Stop, On a Carousel, Stop Stop Stop, Pay you Back, and Carrie-Ann were the hits. The sound on this CD is incredable for recordings that are 40 years old!! Listen to those Beatles harmonies!!"
2,face plates for 99 gmc sonoma,"Product was decent. Everything was going good on installation, but when mounting into vehicle, there seemed to be 2 mounting brackets missing. Had to modify to make it work. Wish the vehicle finder was more accurate. But no more cost that it was not to bad. I would probally look for another option next time."
1,DONT BUY,It wasnt what i thought it was. the metal part of the kit was bent and couldnt be fixed. Simple as this< it sucked.
2,Didn't Fit like it said it would,The kit did not fit the car like the product description said it would. I matched it to the vehicle but it ultimately did not fit. Annoyed since it was a gift and the recipient had to go by another car kit.
5,Big Thumbs Up!,"""The long awaited first book featuring 80 duotone images from artist Jeff Palmer has just been published by Bruno Gmunder of Germany. This exceptional monograph features the powerfully sensual images that the artist is known for -- romantic, erotic, honest and beautiful.Sensual Men reveals the more seductive nature of Jeff's work as well as some of his timeless classics -- a certain choice for collectors and admirers of the male nude. This 6 1/2 by 9 1/2 hard bound volume is an attractive addition to any collection."""
2,Below par.,"A bit of a disappointment. Mostly pictures of over-developed men in various types of embraces. Also, the pages are quite small. There are much better books around."
3,Small Photo Book. It's Just Okay.,"The book was smaller in stature and length than I expected (my fault, I know, since the page count and dimensions are listed, but still). The small paperback looks and feels more like a ""booklet"" than anything you'd put on a coffee table and it would easily disappear between to larger books on your bookshelf.In terms of content, this isn't a ""bad"" set of images... but most of the photos and models portrayed in the book don't quite live up to the hopes expectations set by the cover image.Bottom line: If you've got a collection and are only interested in making a *small* addition, this book could fit the bill. However, if you're looking for a male photography book to enjoy on its own or to help start or establish your collection, keep looking."
4,Well Worth Hunting Down,"My introduction to Meav was the original Celtic Women concert. I was particularly impressed by her performance there and decided to dig into her earlier work. This CD is my favorite and not to be confused with the later Celtic Women disc that has the same cover art. This release is the product of a gifted perfectionist and a host of similarly minded co-conspirators. The only negative thing that I can say is that, in places, this does come off sounding like work as opposed to fun. But hey, this is the product of a perfectionist. She is one of the finest sopranos on the plant and here is the proof. Despite the New Age tag, the material chosen here leans more towards Charlotte Church and the vocal delivery resembles that of the ladies from Anonymous 4. You can read other reviewers who will break down their favorite highlights. This CD is worth hunting down. Meav is that good and this is her finest release."
5,Pure Heaven,"I was listening to the New Age radio on AOL when I heard Meav.She sent me to heaven with her voice.I knew I had to have her CD.I picked this one by the reviews, and boy am I glad. She has the most heavenly voice that I've heard in a long time.She is a must for your collection."
1,Not even the actual book!,Inside this book is nothing about Barbary Pirates. Its some document about the trial of Aaron Burr!
2,"good characterization, but slow and unoriginal","The point-of-view characters are vivid and engaging. It's difficult for a genre author to succeed with flawed protagonists, since so many readers want adolescent wish fulfillment. Williams manages it very competently.Unfortunately I didn't find much else to like about the book. I lost patience with the glacial pace of the storytelling and stopped reading around page 150. I kept waiting for a spark of originality, and it never came."
4,A Grand Rumble,A nice meditational piece. The clarinet used is unrecognizable as a clarinet. The soundscape is a grand rumble with various subtle diversionary sound bits entering onto and off of the soundscape throughout. An enjoyable experience.
2,Quality Not There,My whole family had fun with this toy the first day. The next day ... it wouldn't start and hasn't started since.
3,"""MUSIC FOR HEALING"" is okay",The tempo and rythm are okay for background music while doing yoga exercises. It is not one of my favorites.
4,music without boundaries,"It becomes a timeless journey, perfect for acupuncture or massage, or just time and space in which to think and create."
5,"Beautiful, relaxing music - perfect for a candle-lit bath.","This is just the CD you need to unwind, relax and drift away. Beautiful, haunting, ethereal - absolutely Divine!"
2,A little too Dreary.... I need something happy to feel healing,"I like the Deep Theta music, but the CD came with a lot of defects, so I had to send it back.I also got this Music for Healing, but it seems a bit dreary and not happy enough compared to the Deep Theta music.I might do better to try this healing music at night instead of in the day. Its not too bad, but the Deep Theta is a lot more of what I would think would be healing and mentally uplifting."
5,MAKE TIME IN YOUR BUSY LIFE TO ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL CD...,"It's not exactly a news flash that we live in an increasingly complex society. Technology is changing at a pace so rapidly that even experts are hard-pressed to keep up. Our businesses are changing daily and becoming more competitive than ever before. Our children are facing challenges & pressures unheard of a decade ago. And, our personal lives have become a fast-paced, multi-tasked assortment of responsibilities & activities requiring the agility of a circus performer just to cope with daily living.Set aside time to listen to this magical CD. It will nourish your soul."
5,Awesome!,If you are looking for a relaxing music...well look no further! It is beautiful! Probably not the best to listen to while driving long distances unless you tend to have severe road rage or anxiety while driving. Works wonders to put my 2 year old to sleep as well as everyone else after a long day!
5,Good to aid in sleep,I listen to this CD every night with headphones and within a short time I am asleep. I'm also hoping that it helps me with physical healing. Nice music.
5,Even the price isn't stressful,"I have several CDs for relaxing by Steven Halpern and others, and just about all of them do what they're supposed to- help me relax, unwind, and get rid of stress. On all of the CDs there are selections that I like better or that relax me better than others, but none of them is grating or irritating. They're great at home or on the commute to work, especially if there's a lot of traffic.Is this CD any better or worse than any other one? No, not as far as I'm concerned. I like playing all of them, and normally don't play the same one twice in a row (I prefer variety). You won't be sorry if you buy this CD- even the price isn't stressful!"
5,Not Just For Massaging,I enjoy this CD so much that I go to sleep listening to it. The sounds soothes me so that I fall asleep faster. It is a very relaxing CD.
3,Not Soothing,I tried listening to this to relax enough to go to sleep. It didn't work. It was monotonous without being soothing.
2,Music for Healing,Thank you for offering this CD at a low price. We enjoy listening to the calm music before falling to sleep.Shipping was fast and the CD came in great shape. Thank you.
5,GREAT DVD,there really is no better DVD than this. SOTY is the best band to watch live. They do so many kool things. They get the audience pumped up and ready to ROCK. Well anyways u should get this DVD because it kicks ass.
1,Story of the Year & Big Blue Monkey,"Story of the Year were previously known as Big Blue Monkey, probably the best heavy band ever to come out of St. Louis. To see the direction they've taken, commercial whine rock, as Story of the Year is not only sad but infuriating. This DVD sucks butt, as did this show at the Pageant, which I attended for no reason other than I had free tickets and nothing else to do that night. Koolus should learn that high roundhouse kicks were only cool when David Lee Roth was still fronting Van Halen and that was more than 20 years ago. A good rock show only requires good rock music, which this band can't deliver. Fire your singer, bring back Big John and call yourselves Big Blue Monkey again."
4,And 4 will become One,"I ordered this for my husbands Wizard's costume; and it arrived lightening fast for Alaska shipping. The only problem was it came in 4 pieces. I contacted the company, and they issued a refund no questions asked. Awesome customer service.We were really bummed it came broken, it looks pretty cool. The actual staff is a PVC pipe, covered in like a paper mache painted black and grey. The skull doesn't look too cheesy, but it isn't as tall as we thought it would be. The one we received was the straight staff with the bald skull."
4,I expected more,"Everyone who likes fantasy art would be satisfied of this book. I like Boris' works. It contains veriety of pictures that prove his great imagination. From exotic women to horrible monsters with their fighting tools. I expected to see more drawing works of him but I found only one. Many works in the book are great and some are not. However, if you are the fan, you must have it."
4,Bellfest,"The amazing world of Boris Vallejo is condensed down into this picture book of god like bodies and fairytail fantasy scenes. Shown are some of his movie work, clothing ad work, Franklin Mint and his most favorite subject, his wife, Julie Bell.There are some comedy moments of his works as well, including a portrait of the then president of the United States, Bill Clinton. He explains that some of his works have been described as too relvealing esspecially of his wife Julie. But as the pictures show when one gets over the fact, they are quite beautiful.A book mainly for the older reader, artist or Vallejo fans only."
2,A technician and an artist are two separate things,"Boris receives an ""A+"" for his technical abilities, but his art gets a resounding ""F"" for personality. There's nothing in his paintings to engage the viewer, nothing that's memorable. His body-builder models look like...body-builder models, stiff and artificially posed. They don't interact with his much-more-interesting creatures, but rather just sort of stand there. Boris' early work when he was at least trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to top Frazetta (now THERE is an ARTIST!) is far more accomplished. Whereas the art in ""Dreams"" is simply eye-candy: quickly consumed and just as quickly forgotten."
3,Thorne Smith's First Book,"Before there was Popeye, Sad Sack, Beetle Bailey and Crock, there was Biltmore Oswald. Biltmore Oswald is the compilation of a weekly series that Thorne Smith wrote for the Naval Journal Broadside. It's the diary of Biltmore Oswald, a hapless naval recuit, and his day to day adventures during World War I.Oswald, a naive innocent, finds himself in many a compromising situation: Showering in the hotel room of the wife of a murderous, jealous man; observing French men greeting each other with kisses, and being pursued by beautiful women, much to the displeasure of his sweetie, Polly.This, as Thorne Smith's first attempt at writing, proved to be quite successful for its time, yielding a sequel, ""Out 'o' Luck."""
5,Great relaxing and driving music,"The latin beat and smooth rythms of his guitar, drum, trumpet, piano combo are perfect for a long car drive and for just relaxing around. I love this CD and havn't really turned it off since I bought it. I heard it playing...and fell in love with it then. I highly recommend this CD."
3,spoiled by Jesse Cook,"Nothing wrong with this music at all, just got it the same time I got 'The Ultimate Jesse Cook' and love it so much more."
3,Difficult Installation,"I have been using Peachtree for many years and have always installed each update very efficiently. This time I purchased the Multi-user. It was impossible to install - mainly because the Peachtree support team was very ineffectual. They were absolutely no help whatsoever. Totally disappointed in this after purchase help. I had to call in an IT specialist. The first one couldn't install it and he tried to use the Peachtree support team - again they were no help. I called in a second IT specialist and he was able to get it installed without Peachtree support in about 2 hours. The total installation hourly commitment was 5 hours plus my 2 hours of trying plus 2 more hours. The cost to install came to over $400. The product itself I like so far - have only been using it for 2 days, but Peachtree needs to have better support techs."
2,No luck with this one either.,"I'm disappointed, I expected this video to be longer and explain things in much more detail. For only 31 min and very little info it is very expensive. The basic information contained in this video is available for free on the internet. To be fair, the chapter on cornering is pretty good. Sadly, I can't recommend a good instructional video as an alternative because I couldn't find one yet."
5,Best vedio for kids,"My son (4.5 yr) really love Real Wheel series. We already have some of the series in tape. But my son love them so much, we decide to buy the whole set in DVD. After receive the DVD, my son still watch at least 3 times of each vedio. Highly recommend if you have a boy from 3 to 5 yr old."
4,"Great videos, especially for kids who loves moving vehicles!","I just recently purchased these videos for my 2 year old son. He loves moving vehicles. I am so glad to buy the 4 dvds at one time. You learn so much about every type of vehicles. The only problem that I had was that when I purchased these dvds, I thought they would have a little bit more action. My son likes these dvds, but gets a little bored, because of all the talking. I'm sure he will like them better when he is a little older."
5,Brave,I knew about this story but had no idea that it was facilitated so soon after the murder of King. As a teacher in today's school this project could most probably never happen and the lives of the children who were lucky enough to be part of the experiment would have never taken place. I think that we should all take heed to the fact that lessons like this can't be taught in today's schools because the schools are afraid of being sued and the parents want to protect their children from talking about controversial subjects. The value of diversity is the not having to agree on everything but being able to look and discuss differences and value other people's perspectives. This DVD is a wonderful look at what we should be doing in school and how to responsibility handle controversial with young children.
5,I was astounded!,Wow! I was astounded by this experiment and by the fact that this teacher was brave enough at that time to teach this lesson in racial prejudice. I was amazed at the reactions of the children. We should all take this lesson to heart and make sure we don't pass on prejudice.
2,Poor construction - functional and aesthetically pleasing,"Poor construction quality and plastic, everything you would expect from a chinese made product. Functions well but very light.The button on top are just to small and hard to get to, especially when you just woke up and are trying to shut the alarm."
1,Not science,"This is the standard text for creationism in the skin of science, avoid at all costs if you care about truth."
1,Worthless & Dishonest,"It's hard to say what is worst in the book: the misconceptions of the sub-text, the intolerance for honest science or the incompetence in which science is presented. The claim that life is the result of intellegent design (ie-God) can't be tested by scientific means and has no power to explain the natural world.It looks, feels, smells and reads like a science book, but it is not. Parents and teachers should be warned against using this book."
1,Read the DASB opinion instead.,"The 139 page opinion by Judge Jones in the Dover Area School Board case is a much, much better read than this book. It is here:http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdfOn page 86, Judge Jones says of this book, ""Accordingly, the one textbook to which the Dover ID (Intelligent Design) Policy directs students contains outdated concepts and badly flawed science, as recognized by even the defense experts in this case."""
1,Replete with lies.,"I beg readers to learn something about evolution before reading this book. Then, you can truely understand how misleading this book is."
1,Cute panda on the cover,"That's one cute giant panda on the cover. Indeed, I see no similarity whatsoever between this cute, innocent creature and us ugly, dirty, corrupt humans, except we all have two eyes, two ears, one nose, two nostrils, ..."
5,Think for Yourself,"I was amazed at the foaming-at-the-mouth reviews from some of the ""enlightened"" here. The cornerstone of a liberal education is to view a topic from a variety of positions, develop critical thinking skills, and make one's own determinations. To hear dogmatic evolutionist preachers scream heresy from thier bully pulpits here and in higher education classrooms toward anyone who would challenge their sacred Darwinian theory only confirms their loss of objectivity (which science is suppossed to hold). I think anyone who is in search for truth should learn about intelligent design (or any other idea) and draw their own conclusions. Science theories of old have always been replaced by the new, leading to critical thought and progress. It would appear that the evolution institution is simply resisting change as all old dying once popular institutions do. Think for yourself."
1,This book is a must read!,"This book is a must read if you are interested in living in the dark ages. The only people who think this book makes sense are lacking in science education. If you think saying ""evolution is just a theory"" somehow discounts evolution, you need to crack open a scientific dictionary and look up the word ""theory""!"
5,the best biology book on the evidnece for Intelligent Design,"This is NOT a young-earth creationist book! This a solid biology text (old-earth) that doesn't ignore or change the facts of nature. Fills in the details for those whom have read Behe, Johnson and Denton. Clear and concise (could use a better glossary though), it makes a great reference or supplemental use with your standard bio text. Never even brings the bible in to it, this book is strictly from science."
1,Cretinism and Intellichimp Design,"I haven't read this book yet, but have read about it because of it't central role in the Dover case.Intellichimp design is cretinism. It is not science.The reviews in here show how badly the religious reich has damaged our country with their cretinism. They're trying to dumb us down and replace science with hogwash."
2,"Nice n' easy, but too long.",Finally a science textbook that isn't so hard! Very few equations or things to memorize.Still it was quite long (that's mainly why I'm rating it so low) and in the end it kind of leaves you hanging. Maybe it could be cross-listed with the mystery section.
5,Wow Thanks,"What can I Say? Wow. I was looking for bad reviews for the simple reason that unpopular things tend to be quite interesting. This Book did not Disappoint.After reading such Scathing reviews I had to give it a shot. What could make otherwise Reasonable, Logical, and Open Minded individuals react so fearfully harsh towards a book?This book definitely raised a few questions in my mind. After so many years of Blindly and Faithfully following Darwin's theory of Evolution, I'm actually surprised to be slapped in the face by cold reality. I had no idea about all the failures in the attempts to Prove that we came from a primordial soup.Sad as it may seem for a Evolution Loving guy like myself, I'm definitely going to research ID.Once again, Thanks for the Bad Reviews guys, I would never have found this book otherwise."
1,Please refrain from purchasing,"Absolute rubbish. It would make great satire if the authors were not serious. Obviously pushing a Christian agenda while trying to cloak itself in scientific disguise, its authors clearly put more emphasis on attacking a scientifically accepted theory than they do offer any alternative to the assertions of evolutionary theory. As a botanist I find this ""work"" a great offense to science, and I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this book. It's about politics for the Intelligent Design squad, not knowledge. What offended me most about this load of garbage is the fact that it is trying to convert young impressionable minds whilst keeping them blinded from the wonders of scientific discovery. Nothing short of child abuse. Do yourself and children the world over a favor by keeping this reprehensible disgrace of a book out of the science classroom."
1,"This book should be in the Religion shelf, if any shelf at all!","Besides the lack of scientific rigor and the brainwashing omission of important details to a logical construction of valid arguments, this book is an offense to the lives and works of a number of dedicated scientists (ultimately, creations of an Intelligent Design intention, if you prefer this language) in trying to twist and pervert their findings to fit the authors' arguments.Buy it and read at your own will, but test and verify it's content, even if just by means of logic and cross referencing, before announcing it as truth.I don't reccomend it though."
1,I've got an island to sell you,"An impossible task-- trying to rationalize that which cannot be rationalized. All this little treatise accomplishes is validating why there is a demarcation between religion and science.Fortunately, faith is not an axiom for testability and scrutiny in science. A veiled attempt at trying to put the scientific bow on the creationist/ID pig."
1,ridiculous and pathetic,I got this pathetic text book to see for my self what The fundy christian right is teaching its children in home school. Sad and ridiculous.
1,"""The Faith That Dare Note Speak Its Name""","That phrase is the title of a review of the book that was published by Jerry Coyne in *The New Republic,* August '05. Coyne has good claim to know something about the subject; he's Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. The review is lengthy--longer by far than any review here could be--and it's scathing. I urge anyone who's suspicious of the many negative reviews that appear here to read it. By all means read *Pandas* too-- but read it to see just how shoddy a book can be. It's hard to understand how anybody could take such stuff seriously, let alone try to force it on ninth graders as a text"
1,Idiocy Becomes Science,"One hopes not. It is disturbing anyone would actually consider something so full of tripe, illogical leaps from 'facts' to 'conclusion' as worth buying much less believing. Whatever your beliefs, this book sells them short. If you're in the Darwin camp, it's just plain wrong. If you're a creationist* it has the same problem -- it doesn't make the case. In short, this book fails to serve ANYONE anything of any value. I'm absolutely not taking sides, but you HAVE to take a position and defend it one way or the other. This book tries to ride the fence and is only good for toilet paper (perhaps). We need a ""ZERO STAR"" review for especially trashy books as this one is.* that's Intelligent Design no matter what anyone's claims"
1,Boo,"Just Boo.Nothing else really, because the subject does not dignify a reasoned response.No Intelligent Design. It simply is not science and has nothing to do with science.Also, F.Y.I. for the people who believe ID *is* science, let me add that there is/are also:No leprechans at the end of the rainbow.No unicorns and virgins in the thicket.No people living in the Hollow Earth.No little people in the TV set.No monsters in the closet.No aura photography.No crash at Roswell.No face on Mars.And yes, we really went to the Moon."
1,"Weak, sentimental appeal to the uneducated","It's smart marketing to put a gentle-looking panda on the cover of this book. Parents who do so will be bringing a cute furry creature into their homes while doing violence to their children's education. This is not science. It's another lame attempt to find a loophole whereby creationists can look less foolish than they have in the past, while hanging on to their sentimental beliefs towards the Bible's creation myths. (By the way, there are two creation myths in Genesis in case the creationists haven't noticed.) The only convincing ""intelligent design"" is in the book's packaging, marketing, and the timing of its publication."
1,Unintelligent hypothesis.,I find it hard to believe a school district was even thinking about instituting this book into their science curriculum. It claims to challenge evolution but generates no testable hypothesis. Intelligent design is just another word for creationism trying to weed its way back into the school system. Quite a poor piece of supposed research.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"Please do not buy this book. Even if you are interested in what is said in this text you are just feeding the funding to expand this hypocrisy. There is NO evidence (and blind faith does not count as it) for this false, junk science. If you want to see what the 'big' deal is with this book, go read material on the Dover, Pennsylvania case or watch the Nova video on it that you can find on Youtube. This is Creationism with a new name slapped on it. This kind of thinking does not belong in a Science classroom. It belongs with all the other religious studies."
1,junk science,There is not a shard of evidence to support that evolution is not happening. This book is devoid of science and is a weak attempt at subverting the peer review that real science must pass.
1,Baloney.,"I used to teach biology, so I was interested in how these authors would argue their case against evolution. If this is all they've got, the Intelligent Design side is in pretty bad shape. I was expecting cogent arguments for their cause. Instead, their arguments were vague, unscientific, and outdated. I even laughed on page 125 when to refute the concept of homologous structures they stated, ""for it is an ancient and valid principle of logic that one cannot assume, for argument's sake, the truth of a proposition as a means of proving it,"" when that is ALL ID and Creationism do."
1,"more about pandas, less about people.","I was seriously disappointed that there weren't more pictures of pandas in this book. Please, more panda pictures in the next volumne.I really love pandas. And it is a scientific fact that pandas are totally cool. Jesus would definitely have loved pandas. So next time, more pandas please."
1,Can't give it zero stars,"I wanted to read this book because of the controversy it has generated. There are only 7 editors and contributors who wrote this 6 chapter, 170 page ""textbook."" The premise is that this ""textbook"" contrasts intelligent design and Darwinian evolution. In actuality, the book selectively promotes facts and theories that support intelligent design and ignores the other 99% of the existant data. This book is a horrible joke. A religious text masquerading as a scientific textbook. I have to wonder...what do the people who believe this book is credible think about cosmology, particle physics, the rest of the universe out there, and the rest of science that has been discovered in the last 2,000 years. Well, I guess if you make believe it simply doesn't (or even can't) exist, you never have to contemplate it or worry about explaining it. That does make life a lot simpler, doesn't it! I feel better now. Guess I'll stay here with my head in the sand for a while longer."
3,Good but not great,"Hi,This book could be titled ""Darwinism: The Myth."" The book spends 90% of it's time talking about Darwinism and why it's wrong. While this is great it isn't necessarily ""Intelligent Design"" as it's distinctive or even it's core competency.As a lay person trying to understand why ID people don't believe in Evolution this will open your eyes. It's the most ""Scientific"" book I've found about the way evolution is taught.If you want straight ID mixed with Creationism try ""Young Earth"" by John D. Morris.There are alot of good bits of info in ""Of Pandas and People."" Having cliff notes of this book and then taking cliff notes of other books could lead to one interesting textbook.Thanks. God Bless.Aaron."
4,A look at the failure to provide evidence for macroevolution,"This book offers a good look at how far short scientists are in providing evidence for macro-evolution. The authors acknowledge the success in proving micro-evolution and explain the difference. Obviously, the religious will love this book and the zealously anti-religious will hate it. Readers should keep the same open mind and scientific rigor as they would when reading other texts. Readers should also finish the book: many questions or criticisms which you might raise in one chapter are addressed in the next."
5,Spectacular,"Unbelievable spectacle. I am a huge Goo Goo Dolls fan and had always heard this is a must own for my music collection. I hate the word ""epic"" when it's used as a slang term as I feel it detracts from the power of the word. With that said, this concert is truly EPIC!"
4,Great group - great DVD!,"This is a great DVD of this ill-fated, stormy concert in Buffalo.Johnny Rezeznik proves that he and his band have the hearts of true rockers by putting on a show in a monsoon!My wife and I are ga-ga for the Goo Goos!"
4,DVD SPECIFICATIONS,"yesterday I watched this concert on DVD and I can confirm the aspect ratio is widescreen 1.78 / 16:9 an not fullscreen, audio is presented in dolby 5.1 too, this is a great concert I just wish it had some more songs"
2,"Loved it, but....",Loved it. Fit the phone perfectly and was exactly what I was looking for. But....feel apart in less then six months.
5,A Man's Battle to Gain Inner Harmony and Truth,"Mahler spent the two summers of 1895 and 1896 on the Attersee near Salzburg, where he finished the compositon of his 3rd when he was only 36. Based on elements of nature, Arnold Schoenberg attended the Vienna premiere in 1904 and told Mahler that he saw it as a struggle between the forces of good an evil, as a reflection of man's battle to gain inner harmony and truth.Anyway you take it, this Symphony is absolutely mesmerizing and powerful, and includes two movements with singing (women's choir and mezzosoprano).Chicago Symphony Orchestra proves -one more time- to be among the top 5 orchestras in the world, and this live recording is nothing but perfection of music engineering. Haitink masters direction in what he knows best (Mahler), and a new label is born: CSO Resound. I wish them many years and successful records. Strongly recommended, a perfect addition to any classical music collection, even though you may already have Mahler's 3rd."
5,Kim Nalley's Need My Sugar,"First solo release by Kim who is well known in the San Francisco Bay Area for her R&B stylings as the lead singer with the Johnny Nocturne Band. Here she shows off her jazzy side on standards and originals with a very sympathetic band assembled for her in Switzerland. Thoroughly enjoyable set of music that leaves you wanting to hear more, more, more."
2,Size is way off...,"I ordered an xsmall (im 5'5 118 lb). It was really baggy. My main problem with that is: unless it's relatively snug, it wont stay in place. The underarm sleeves kinda bunch up (cuz they're loose) so it doesnt stay dry. In fact im more hot/with no protection. It would probably work ok in looser tops, but thats no what i got it for. My work shirts have slightly fitted arms so this is not the solution. Keep in mind, if you have larger arms this might work fine. So unless u can DOWN SIZE by 2 SIZES, it is a WASTE of $20."
3,"F*** Ratings, know what it is before ya buy it","This installment is done much better then vol 1. The last one made you suffer through the theme song constantly on every single epidose then made you suffer through it some more in the credits at the end of every episode. Least this time they worked out that that was annoying and have it just start with the name of the episode and go staright into it.However, there is not enough on these. There is about 20 minutes of the show, then 20 minutes of bonus stuff thats ok in some parts but just not enough.A DVD's capability is that it can hold 4 hours of good quality video on it. So you should feel completly cheated that this is only 40 minute's long. They should combine season 1 & 2 together and get somethign closer to value for money then release these things individualy just to make some cash out of it."
1,Poor Authoring,"I have to say I bought the first one and found it really funny, the titles got a bit annoying, but I found the dvd itself very well put together and slick. Unfortunately the same can't be said for this one, I found it very poorly put together, black gaps between everything and have had 2 copies and still find they stick at the same points on a number of dvd players. Shame they didn't stick to the original format as the episodes are very funny, but it spoils the enjoyment of watching them."
1,needs a rating.,"This DVD has a lot of graphic violence. It has not been given a rating. Because of the violence, this DVD should be given an R rating or [ X or Nc-17 rating.] Please do not show this DVD to children under 17."
4,A part of American History not focused on nearly enough.,"This book is written for children, but I found it invaluable. Written in easy to digest, but poignant bits of information, it provides snap shots of the main players and a sequence of event leading up to the final goal. The pictures and quotes artfully featured throughout the book highlight attitudes and the era in which the last push took place. The Bibliography provides a great guide for further reading. There is also a section giving information about some of the main women supporters, helping clarify who each one is ( when reading the story I found on occasion I got the people mixed up and this section helped straighten out everything beautifully). This is a book I plan on adding to my children's book shelf and is worthy to be added to all children's libraries."
4,Siddharta Volume III,"I have the other 2 Siddharta volumes, all Buddha Bar's, (including 8...don't buy 8...it's really a tragedy!) and two Chill Out in Paris CD's. Volume III, while different than the previous volumes, is quite good. It's an additional flavor & compliment to the other volumes. Ravin has a great ear for music and blending tracks. On the first disc, cut 7, he found an unbelievable hip, up to date rendition of ""Chain of Fools"". This volume is not as ethnic as the others but Ravin shows nice range in mixing volume III. And not to worry, it's not without its ethnicity. The first disc starts very smooth & hip building tempo in the end tracks. In disc two, he takes it up a notch with some nice electronic with culture & class...not the hard repetitive thump with no soul or lyrics. If you like the Buddha Bar and the previous two Siddharta's, it's likely Siddharta III will not disappoint."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,I got this game on a whim expecting a fun platformer. Man was I wrong.Pros:3d controller compatibleGraphicslevel designCons:ControlsLame BossesUnbalanced Boss FightsUnresponsive ControlsLength of each levelLack of originality or depthMusicFun FactorNo interesting characters
5,Great Danish music.,"A tragically overlooked composer, Gade may be considered Denmark's greatest musical export. Although all his symphonies are good, I recommend his 5th Symphony above the rest, as it almost wants to be a piano concerto at times with some of the most lyrical themes I've heard in this particular genre. The first and third movements are particularly beautiful. Now go enjoy some fine Danish music. Sköl!"
3,nascent genius captured on compact disc.. story at seven,"i picked up this album after i'd had bricolage and permutation for a year or so. some of it works and some of it doesn't; tobin's gimmickery is more prominent here than in his later works, and it gets in the way of his music-making. but tobin's mature tricks are what make his newer tunes so fantastic, and foam's a great place from which to watch the growth of his powers. still, this is pretty solid stuff - ""fat ass joint"" is a sly, wicked tune, and there are other standouts - it's just not so chewy and flavorful as his recent efforts. especially Supermodified. oh man.."
4,Cujo Bleeds jazz,"Adventures in Foam is very unique. This album concentrates on both Jungle, Jazz, and Hip hop at the same time to create a very funky/groovy sound very seldomly heard. Traffic (track 2 i believe) has got to be one of the coolest drum&bass songs i've ever heard. And you just have to like songs like ""fat a** blunt"". I think it is essential. The actual sound is kinda raw and unpolished but its definitly worth checking out."
5,Amon Tobin -- Truly one of the great geniuses of our time!,"Not much more needs to be said. This is Acid Jazz/Drum & Bass at its absolute finest. Melodic, evocative, playful and sinister. Sets the mark by which all others will be judged. Buy this album, and Bricolage, Permutations, and Supermodified (under Amon Tobin, not Cujo) and any song/album/remix this guy sets his hands on. You will thank yourself for doing it."
3,A good album.... but not THAT good...,"I admit, this is a great album and definately worth picking up, but it isn't something to go nuts over. While The Sighting and Cat People are two extremely good tracks, there is a lot of better stuff out there. Get some DJ SS if you like Jazz & Bass."
1,Don't buy it!,"Like the other reviewers say, this cd does not contain the theme song. What's the point of making a cd about a show and not have the theme song. There are probably only two songs worth anything on this cd. Don't waste your money."
1,Where's the score?,"Sleeper Cell is largely scored by authentic sounding middle-eastern music... and the soundtrack delivers club beats, some soul stuff, light rap and slow pop songs? There's no theme and only track #3 has any resemblance to what I was expecting from this."
2,Confused.,"To the reviewer before me... is the show's theme song, you claim is on here, really on here? I bought the cd for the show's theme and it's not even on the soundtrack....."
3,Where's the theme music.....blown away?,I bought this for the theme music and it's not there. I feel a bit ripped off. Can anyone tell me why?Track 1 though would have been a good replacement the original theme.
3,"A good reference book, but an average history one.","This book is practical for references. But the author is often wrong. I found about a dozen fatal errors, and several minor ones. I have read many, many books of pirates history. If the author had truly read with care his masive bibliography, then he would not have made so many mistakes. I do not believe he did his homework well. Also, he does not gives any body of notes, so we the readers do not know where he took his data from, nor can we distinguish when is he using primary sources or when he is making things up. I recomend it only with reserves. For a better book, see David Cordingly, or go to the masters as Gosse."
5,Very good training manual,"I used a composition book for recording my workouts prior to buying this training journal, so I don't really have another journal to compare it to. However, I found exactly what I was looking for with this journal: easy to use one page entries for each workout day; record specific weights used for each exercise set; room to write cardio exercises on same workout page; and room for many sets within one exercise group. In fact, there's room for about 15-20 exercises with about 10-15 sets per exercise on each separate workout page. For people who are mostly involved in stair masters, stationary bikes, or other cardio exercises, this is NOT the book for you. Instead, for those of you who mostly lift weights...welcome home."
5,Thank you.,"Training journals are great tools to ensure progress by being able to refer to previous weights and reps. The only thing that I don't like about this particular journal is the way the front cover is designed to go over the spiral binding. This design increases the chances of the front cover ripping off because it does not fold back neatly. Overall though, I do like this journal."
4,"Its ""MUSIC"" appreciation not Magic appreciation.","Hopefully that clears up a few things;)recall that this is the 70's Howdy Doody...not the 50's thought it is equally intertaining!If you are a fan of Clarabell the Clown then this is a must have..lots a great Clarabell gags in this one!Synopsis as read on back of DVD:""Music Appreciation Week"" features all sorts of Doddlers, who show how much fun it can be to play an intrument or sing, a guest apperance by cunductor Leonard Birdstune. It also marks a return visit by the G-Man, a former Doodler who recalls his old feud with Clarabell, and the world premier of the Doodyville symphony orchestra."
3,Item NOT made in U.S.A.!,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Product FeaturesThis stoneware Ocean Breeze coffee Mug is a contemporary way to serve hot beveragesDishwasher, microwave and freezer safeMade in USAThe above is the only reason I purchased these mugs. They were gifts for someone a little more concerned where products are made than I am. I recieved the order super fast but when I examined the mugs they clearly say Made In China on the bottom. Not real happy. At least I now have 2 new coffee mugs."
4,Fun Game for the entire family,"My kids (10 and 7) love legos and they love games. They also love building things.We were really excited to try this one out- to see if it is challenging enough for the adults but not too hard for the 7 year old.The basic premise is that you have colored blocks. You have a set time to try and build structures with the blocks from a picture card. The successfully completed structures earn points, which accumulate towards winning.We enjoy playing it, and I think the idea of making 3D structures from pictures is a really important skill to learn.Pros: Lots of cards and two levels of play means that you rarely repeat a structure.You can modify the game for different players of different levels.Cons: If you are good at it, you're good, and if you're bad, you're bad. There's not much chance involved, and not much acquired skill.Overall I think we will keep this game for a while."
4,"Hand-eye skill needed, yet enough luck to still be a game","This game requires some luck, because you must roll dice to determine the amount of time you get to test your hand-eye coordination skills."
3,okay,game is for youngerish kids. we didn't play long as it was not very much fun(2 adults) while stuck in hospital
4,excelente diversion para todas las edades,"gran juego para los niños, los pone a pensar en algo construtivouna buena opcion"
3,"Nice book, better for older children",This book is better suited for ages probably 3 and up. It's a loving story explaining the day your child was born. Just don't like the illustrations.
4,Truth: A Guide,"Simon Blackburn provides interesting insights into the philosophical problem of truth. While many would like the issue of truth to be an easily resolved question via some simplisitic answer, Blackburn points that while a parsimonious answer might be advantageous as in the case of minimalism or deflationism or even quietism, the issue of truth still continues to persist."
4,"Smooth, easy, and comfortable -- I had no ...","Smooth, easy, and comfortable -- I had no problem with this condom. I'd recommend it to my friends."
3,not so bad,"quiet interesting view. could add another look at harry potter books. not as good as the original, of corse, but does well for those who like the other sides of life."
2,This is not the first college guide for women.,"Actually, the first guide looking at the college search from a female perspective was published last year: The Smart Girl's Guide to College. Considering that there is so much misleading information about colleges out there already, it's unfortunate the authors of this book would begin with a misrepresentation."
3,A compulsively watchable epic,"""The Messenger"" is a compulsively watchable and notable film, not only for its visual lavishness, but also for its approach: it takes a shop-worn period tale, and delivers it in a much more contemporary and modern pace. Instead of just saying, ""This is a movie about a girl named Joan of Arc"", it gives us interesting insight on the power of the conscience, psychology, and religion. Milla Jovovich is pretty good as the lead character, always boisterous and impulsive, but at the same time understandable. While the dialogue was a little drab (the audience is always one step ahead--we know what the characters are going to say), and the movie drags a little, it is more than made up for by the sheer epic feeling you feel when the camera takes you in the heat of those battles. The scenes where Joan is in interal conflict are disturbing and wrenching. Mostly, though, it's plain fun and entertainment."
2,One of Those Books You Just Want To Throw Across The Room,"When I read Prom Night, I COULD NOT wait until Senior Cut Day. Finally, the witch was dead(Alanna), and Conner and Elizabeth had already established a friendship. This is the second last series of the book, and you'd think the author would just make us happy and bring Liz and Conner back together. Well... that isn't the case, and it was definitely what I've been waiting for ever since they broke up, so I'm giving this book 2 stars. Some parts were cute, but I was just too disappointed."
3,Good for the price,The shirt appears to be ok. The only part I don't like is the sleeves. The opening of the hand is made straight (I thought it would be tighter like most hoodies/sweatshirts are.)
2,"Jittery, lacks body","I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof. But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
4,A Good Read!,"Like any compendium whose chapters were written by different experts, The Biology of Business has its ups and downs. As a collection of ten deeply informed essays on complexity theory management, its voices vary. But when you're in the perilous business of trying to predict just where the cutting-edge of technology will cut next, is that really a bad thing? The diversity and scope - what is now fashionably called ""bandwidth"" - of this volume surely could not be matched by any single author's work. As you read through topics as diverse as law, marketing, nurturing start-ups and the application of advanced biological concepts to management, you will indeed find yourself challenged to adapt. That's as it should be. Reading this book may change the way you perceive your business. As the biological paradigm continues to spread through consultants' minds like a complex adaptive mold spore, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this sophisticated book to help you stay au currant."
4,Very chilling...,"First off, this is literally the only book that I could find on this subject. Over 6,000 people died on this boat, making it THE greatest sea disaster of all time, far surpassing the Titanic. However, because the folks on the boat were of German descent and fleeing the Allies at the end of WWII, I guess most folks thought that it would be better if the victims were forgotten.No matter who the victims were, they should be remembered. The differing accounts by the survivors were chilling, and my heart broke to read of how the children fared. More studies need to be done on this, and the world needs to hear of this story."
1,Disappointing!,"This slim volume was the first English language book about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff. It was published in 1973, by a British journalist. Unfortunately, it is written in the style of a magazine piece. Sources were four survivors, though whether he interviewed them personally, is uncertain. Poorly researched, no footnotes, or index. American readers will find the British vernacular mystifying.Did the Germans really use ""bloody"" as a figure of speech?This book is entertainment, nothing more.The best historical account is ""The Cruelest Night"" (1979) by Dobson, Miller, Payne.Highly recommended! Available through Amazon sellers.Also highly recommended, is the German TV movie ""Die (the) Gustloff"" (2008).Never shown or issued in America, it was shown in Australia, and issued on DVD, with English subtitles. Available in USA from online sellers. Google it."
2,Not for the well-read or well-educated,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. This dictionary had a great premise, but fell far short in the execution.I would expect to see some words included that are often misused, such as ""affect"" and ""effect"". But ""Gentile"", ""civil"", or ""rotund""? There are a number of words that I can understand being included, if only for their similarity to other words (as above) or because the are actually foreign words (nom de guerre, for example). But most of the words included are not particularly confusing, much less difficult.The good thing? The definitions are clearly worded.In a nutshell, there's a reason my local library has it shelved in the juvenile section. For them, it would be a dictionary of difficult words. Advice: peruse it first. See if the majority of the words are truly difficult for the user."
1,incorrectly titled!!,"Do not waste your time/money. This is NOT a dictionary for difficult words. Please who thought this was?? Totally misrepresented.I want a dictionary with no words such as cat, dog, tree, grass etc. this is not it."
3,"Nice enough, until it broke","The scanner worked nicely and set up as a network scanner was incredibly easy. It was not as fast as I hoped it would be and, unfortunately, stopped scanning after about 3 months. I have not had a chance to check it yet; might just be a slipped drive band (that pulls the scanning light) but I think that these things should be built to last a bit longer than 3 months.When I have the time I will check it out and, if that is not the cause, see how good Epson's customer service is. I'll report back."
4,Unusual look at WW II enemies outside of the battlefield.,"This book provides a fascinating look at human nature in an unusual environment: enemies who would kill each other on a battlefield are forced to adapt to each other in the context of a Prisoner of War camp in California.It's the little things that stick with you: the amazement the young Germans felt at taking three days to cross the country by speeding train, and the realization that their government had gone to war with a nation with virtually unlimited resources. The multiple cases of guards dropping or losing their guns, only to have a prisoner hand it back to them. Or the few hardline Nazi's who threatened their fellow prisoners and attempted to keep the war going at any cost.A compassionate and reassuring study of human nature."
2,Hebrew for losers,This won't get you far....Unless you want to ask for a steak in the most overblown hebrew one can imagine...Try something more contemporary.
3,A comprehensive history of a remarkable man.,"While this book provides an in-depth view into the man himself, it does not provide the reader with detailed accounts of his campaigns and battles. It does analyze them on a basic level, but does not capture the imagination the way one would expect of a battle such as Brandy Station or Five Forks. However, it is a very readable and enjoyable book."
3,Just like Aunt Margie said...,"Being a dyed in the wool history buff, and especially interested in the American Civil War, I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of attention payed by the author to Sheridan's battles and tactics. However, much has already been written on that subject by others, including Sheridan himself (in excruciating detail). I found the book interesting for it's attempted insight into the man and why he may have acted as he did, especially after the war. My great-aunt Margie (Sheridan's grand-niece) always said he was a S.O.B.. I can see how that opinion may have merit in certain circles."
4,Good stories and art,"If you know a little about mythology it will be interesting to read about the same tales in the point of view of the goddesses. I liked the story from the eyes of the gorgons epsecially. But if you are looking for a great collection of art by Boris Vallejo, I suggest getting yourself ""Mirage"" or ""Fantasy Art Techniques"". ""Ladies"" only has about 10 colored paintings and maybe 20 pencil drawings. The paintings aren't nearly as beautiful as in his other books. (but you may like them more if you are interested in mythology) Many of the figures have big 80's-looking hair that just doesn't look good. (as do several figures in ""Dreams"")They do not look well-planned. But if you are a fan of Boris Vallejo, you should get this book to add to your collection."
1,"Beware not Original, Singer below average","The songs are really cover version ie not original and no where come close to the King Kishore Kumar. Overall the singer 'Ravi Kulkarni' sounds below average singer. Don't waste your money, but original and original are available in the market."
3,A light summer read,"Stuart's latest romance requires a hefty suspension of disbelief. It would however be somewhat easier to overlook the implausible plot elements if there were more chemistry between Chloe and Bastien. There isn't. It's not that I didn't like ""Black ice""; I did. It's a nice relaxing book for those times when you don't want to think overly much or expend any significant amount of emotional energy. It most definitely does not hold a candle to Stuart's earlier efforts: ""Ritual Sins"", ""Moonrise"" and ""Nightfall""."
4,Hands and feet inside the ride please..........,"Cause its gonna blow you away. Having just discovered Anne Stuart I am sucking up her books like a vaccume. This is # 2. I like the bad boy alpha male hero type. My favorite and only type! Bastien falls into that category. He is very hard, almost cold. And he kept most everything in, even from the reader, so you dont see him falling in love. We know Chloe is in love. She has no qualms about letting the reader know what was on her mind.This was a very interesting story, some parts were hard to believe, but I chose to ignore that in favor or enjoying a darn fine good book. I can go with the flow, whatever makes a good story. This is a very heart pounding book, pretty bloody as a warning. And I wanted a little more of an ending for these two, but I closed the book with a smile on my face. Very good book. i recommend this highly."
2,Page turner but characters a turn off....,"While I couldn't put the book down until I finished it, the characters are a turn-off. So many people raved about this book ([...] listed it as one of the best that year), and it is a good read. However, the hero was practically a sociopath, who suddenly started caring for the heroine near the end even though the whole time he's threatening to kill her/leaving her to be tortured, etc. The heroine herself is typically TSTL (too stupid to live), no match for the hero, can't do anything, etc. It was just icky after awhile."
5,I loved it!!!!,"It's an Anne Stuart novel. So if you expect happy sunshine all the way through - this is not your good night story.But as to the Anne Stuart fans - I so deeply enjoyed this one. I hope the ""Ice"" series will continue as long as possible.I would prefer a more relaxed ending though. But that's just the way all the Anne Rice novels tend to end. Very climatic and you just keep thinking about how the story will turn out to be.But hey, that why you have the following Ice novels. There, you can follow what happens to Chloe and Bastien. Not in detail though - but they reappear."
4,i'll read more,"Just beginning to read romantic suspense and this is the fourth anne stuart book i've read in the last week... so far this one is the best. She does write tortured heroes which is muy appreciated but I would like to know their pov's a little more. for example, he tells her if she wants him she's going to have to take him. but why? i know there must have been a reason he felt that way, that this was a big deal for him and if that scene had been in his pov i might know why. too distant to get 5 stars."
5,Amazing Series,"Anne Stuart is amazing. I believe this is the first of the Ice series and I literally could not put it down until I was done. Great supsense, plot twists and of course, romance!"
2,Ick!,"Ooogh! I hated this book. The plot was totally improbable, as were the sex scenes. He was a psychotic creep, with a huge opinion of himself. She was a wittering fool who ""fell in love"" with him in spite of the fact that he left her to be tortured and/or die at least 3 or 4 times. I read it all the way to the end - I shouldn't have. It never got any better."
3,An easy read,It was entertaining. Not realistic but a fun escape. I enjoyed it as it was my first Anne Stuart book.
3,Ok but nothing special,"I've read many romantic suspense novels and I found this one ok but, like I said, nothing special. Considering the other reviews I was expecting more. The plot is extremely unrealistic and I didn't find the characters particularly compelling. This was my first book by this author and I'm not sure if I'll buy more by her."
1,Garbage,"When I started reading this book, I thought it was going to be an ok book. But Good God! Was I wrong! The heroine was painfully young (irritatingly so) and the ""hero"" was an ass. She seemed to have no self control and apparently all he needed to do was kiss her and she would lose all her inhibitions. Give me a break! After about 90 pages I had had enough. Unlikeable characters, nonsensical story. As if an assasin like that would ever fall for a wet noodle like Chloe. The book was a complete turn-off in every way."
1,I am done with this author ...,"By the past, I have loved Anne Stuart books. I love rogues like the next woman !NOT this one. The heroine is childish, the hero is boring. All the characters are flat. There is no tension, no suspense.The sex is boring. The love story inexistant. I am sorry I spend the money ! Do not bother with this one ..."
5,Awesome mount for my new Mac Pro,Simple to install- keeps the machine out of the dust and off the floor so I can keep the area cleaned without constantly moving the machine or fighting with a gaggle of cables. Highly recommended for all neat freaks and OCD geeks!
5,Perfect !!!,The watch band is perfect with my watch and complemented the two-tone case and bezel. The length and width are just right for my wrist. Excellent quality.
2,Paper Monsters,"Those that like Depeche Mode will be mildly impressed with frontman David Gohans foray into life as a solo artist. The tracks from the CD are for the most part gritty, a reminder of tracks from the CD Songs of Faith and Devotion which at the time was groundbreaking for Depeche Mode. The only problem of course is that CD was released back in 1993. 10 years later its nothing but the same for Gohan. Whereas Songs of Faith and Devotion possessed a sense of raw anger (Gohan's bitter divorce clearly factored into this CD), Paper Monsters lacks that raw emotion. Still I could be wrong in my assessment as the first track to be released off of the CD, Dirty Sticky Floor is getting a lot of air time. Best track for me would be Stay. All in all though its more of the same, a clear disappointment in the end"
5,"The flames of ""Wishfire"" meet the ice of ""Ethernaut""","is this a ""single"" or is it a ""EP""? well at over 70 minutes long with 13 tracks it doesnt really qualify as either. But whatever you call it, its still a fans dream come true. With 7 remixes, one re-released track, 3 versions of single ""Winterborn"" (from the latest album ""Ethernaut"") and two completely new tracks, this album is perfect for DJs and Cruxshadows fans alike. The new track ""Dancefloor Metaphor"" is a fabulously dancable song, whilst ""Sinking"" is heart wrenchingly beautiful (""Sinking"" and the remixes provide the link to ""Wishfire"" as ""Sinking"" was originally intended to be on that album). ""Winterborn"" on the other hand provided a sample of the glory that was to be ""Ethernaut"". The ""Sacrifical Acoustic Version"" makes me cry every time I hear it.if you love the Cruxshadows you'll love this."
5,between the fire and the ice,"Few bands can create successful re-mix EPs that you want to listen to over and over, but CXS have done it.Even if you dont like remixes but it for the glorious acoustic version of ""Winterborn""."
3,Hair twisters,"These weren't so bad only, they are very hard to use if you have thick hair. There just isn't enough twisters to use all throughout your hair for curls if your hair is thick. They can be very tricky to use. You really have to have alot of patience to curl your hair in these. They come out very easily if you don't twist your hair just right to hold them in. Even then, you have to have small sections of hair to wrap around the twister. I think they need to come up with a better solution for all hair types and making them very easy to stay in without rolling out. This product takes ALOT of patience and a lot of time. I wouldn't recommend if you have some where to go with very little time. If you have three hours to get ready, this product is for you!"
5,You may have a beautiful philosophy......,"Dr. Seale explains the meaning of the parables, the outcome of his classes and lectures over a period of years. The Bible quotations are from the King James Version. Dr. Seale is an exceptional communicator and brilliant metaphysician. My extensive notes refer to mustard seed (69), pearl of great price (97), wisdom (38), negative people (42), Truth (78), evil (62), choice (153), study (238), persistence (184), skill (234). ""You may have a beautiful philosophy, you may have lofty ideals, but what you will do with your philosophy and ideals is dependent entirely upon what you are inside yourself."" A truly great book."
1,Mic does not work with a PC,"Bought this product a few weeks ago to replace my old Logitech headset which I had used for 2 years with no problems for skype. Logitech usually has really great products so I was confident in the product. The sound comes through just fine, however the mic does not work at all. I've spent about 2 hours looking for a fix and and the only work around I've found is to unplug it, restart the computer and plug it in a new USB slot which is no kind of solution at all.Avoid this product if you intend to use the mic."
1,First and only time Logitech let me down,"This is a shoddy product. First of all I didn't know it was only a single speaker on your left ear, the right side is a very uncomfortable plastic paddle that digs into the side of your skull and makes me want to rip it into pieces. So no stereo audio possible and it's uncomfortable. The mic was perfect and clear on the PS3, but I wanted a headset I could use to play a game in the early morning without waking anyone up before I go to work, with sound in only one ear it was horrible for games like Mag, can't tell the directions rockets come from etc.Sum it up to keep this short: Mono sound in left ear only, uncomfortable, clear mic but worthless since I don't want to wear it. Spend the extra $3 for a full stereo USB headset that isn't shoddy from Logitech."
1,Crappy,"This headset sucks. I bought it so in MW2 I could talk to my friends. When I GOT THE HEADSET IT said ONLY for ....... All the games were made in 2007, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,logitech headset,"I have a young child that sleeps in the same room as me, so i can not have the t.v. too loud while playing video games. So im not really looking for using it for talking to people while playing games, im just trying to hear the game without waking up the baby. Would this work for me?"
2,last only 3 months !!,My son use it for his PS3 frequently but it last only 3 months....... first the audio two weeks later the mic I though it was an excellent and cheap option. Just keep that in mind
2,CHEAPLY MADE,I purchased several of these headsets prior to upgrading to a bluetooth headset. These headsets sound good but they are cheaply made and do not last. A little tug on the cord is all it takes and it stops working. If you are purchasing for use on the Playstation 3 then the PS3 Bluetooth Headset is a much better option in my opinion.PlayStation 3 Bluetooth Headset
2,No Frills,"The headset is okay, but not great. On the plus side I do like the long cord (apx 10') and the colored LED mute indicator (blue when live, red when muted) to remind you if you're live or not. However on the other hand, the headset is not that comfortable. The part that goes over my head just doesnt seem to fit me very well. The volume also is just never loud enough. I keep it all the way up and I can still barely hear anyone."
5,"Excellent, a must buy.","I bought this thinking it was the exact headset I've had for 2 years now. However, whenI opened the box i was pleasently surprised! The new design forms to your head so no longer does the microphone slip of in the middle of the game. The headset comes with 3 removeable and interchangeable earpieces: one leather ""squishy"" one, one regular foam, and one velvet one. I prefer the foam one because the others apply too much pressure to my ear and it causes pain. The only negative thing i have to say about this product is that the earpieces take forever to interchange!!! Other than that i give this product a 10/10. By the way, I have not played any other game with this headset besides Socom: Combined Assault. I'm interested to see if it actually works on PS3 games as per the packaging."
4,Nice wireless headset,Nice headset for the money. I wish it had a little better adjustment range on the mike but very nice other than that.
2,Quit working after 32 days of use,"I was kinda disgusted that these quit working after a month of use.I looked up logitech and called them.I was pleased with customer service. They answered the phone in the evening on a weekend... :) and spoke English.After a small investment of my time; They sent an upgraded G330 gaming headset.It arrived 12 days later (including weekends) at no charge.Once the new headset arrived its apparent that the replacement headset (G330 gaming headset) is superior.It has a dual stereo headset and mic.It's available on Amazon its a few extra bucks, but I think its likely worth it.I would buy Logitech again, simply because they treated me so awesome."
2,It was really BAD!,"I love the products Logitech make, but this was a terrible one. When I first bought it, it lasted less than a month. Also, it can easily fall off, it doesn't feel comfortable, and it hurts my ear after a while. SO I highly recommend NOT to buy this product, but another one from Logitech."
1,AVOID,"i had this for a day before it broke. I then promptly returned it and bought the PS3 bluetooth headset instead. that works great, but this logitech headset sucks. It feels awkward to wear and the sound quality of the mic is pretty cheap. Overall, it's not worth the cheaper the price compared to the bluetooth headset. buy that instead"
2,*****WARNING********,"At best this headset purchase will be a crap shoot. Even after i read complaint after complaint about this headset, after only 2 days, the mic stopped working. It's not only the PS3 for which I bought this for, I even tested it on my PC using Skype, and it still won't work.Too bad, other than the fact that sound only comes out of one ear, the other is a dummy speaker, it keeps popping off!Yes it's cheaply made, but if only the mic would last for more than a few days it would be worth the headache. I only hope I get my money back as I am returning it without the original packaging, cause it was working! BUT ONLY FOR 2 DAYS! One star for each day it worked."
4,no dead batteries,"For the price i couldn't pass it up,,,it works fine and when playing no distortion,,and the most important thing was the battery doesn't go dead, i have owned wireless headsets before and when your playing they go dead and you have to find a headset and start over,,but i recommend this product to anyone because no. 1 the price and the product works well."
2,Great price bad construction,"I thought this item would be good based on reviews I had read. It lasted about a week and a half before the wires detached from the base unit. They were loose from the start so I figured it would have happened at some point but we didn't even make it thru Christmas break. My son said he could hear his voice echo while speaking into it but he liked that it didn't need to be charged. I would have given it a higher rating had the construction of the unit been of better quality. As it stands I had to purchase that one plus ended up getting the higher priced Sony Bluetooth which we are happy with, so far."
2,Logitech Headset,I would not recommend this headset. after a week the mic stopped working. i bought the Sony Official PS3 Wireless Stereo Gaming Headset which cost around $90.00 but its well worth it and will last you long time.
4,Great but not so great if you wear glasses,"Got these as a Christmas gift for my 13 yr old and he loved them at first. The product worked as stated except he found them uncomfortable to wear for any length of time due to his glasses. My son said the headphone pushed his glasses into his head making it very uncomfortable to the point where he asked me to return them! Just a warning for those out there with glasses, thinking of getting the Logitech PS3 USB Headset."
2,Is this the only USB headset that works on PS2?,"I realize that there are exactly 2 headsets that seemed to be endorsed, but I stuck an Apple USB keyboard in the same USB slots for these headsets and that works fine. Has anyone tried another kind of USB headset, other than the two offered here, using one of the two USB ports in the front of your PS2? That would be good to know for sure. Because there are other quality USB headsets out there. I would be willing to bet that if SONY's PS2 website doesn't specifically endorse any headset, under the heading of ""hardware"" then, other headsets are up for grabs. If you know for certain, and have actually tested this theory, post here, please!"
2,Necessary piece of junk,"Unfortunately this is the only microphone that works with the PS2 and is necessary to play the karaoke revolution games, which are really fun for the whole family. I'd recommend buying it with the game as a set. You can save about $5 doing it that way. If you play very much you will need to purchase more down the road since they are not made very well. You also need to have it in just the right position or it won't pick up your voice. I hope that they will eventually come out with some kind of adapter so you can plug in a standard karaoke microphone that actually works for more than a month."
1,This headset sucks!!!! Buyer Beware!!!!,I purchased this for a friend about two months ago. It has already stopped working. This is a piece of junk. It is so flimsy and the USB connector is flimsy as well. DO NOT BUY!!!!
2,Logitech PlayStation 3 Vantage USB Headset,"The Logitech PlayStation 3 Vantage USB Headset seemed great for a while and my son loved it. A year later (about 2 weeks ago) the microphone stopped working. I asked him if he stepped on it and he said no, then I get an Amazon email notice that it's ""eligible for a trade in"". Hmm, maybe because there have been other complaints? If so, I don't want the lousy $8 or $9 credit they want to give me on my account, I want a new one or a refund! Anyone else having the same problem with this model, please let me know.TGParent@comcast.net"
3,Good but not to good.,"This item is not a marathon runner only after three months of use the microphone came off, this was not a problem just a frustrating reattachement. The main problem I had was that the speaker is busted, and the only way to fix the problem, that I could find without removing any thing, was to take the cord and place it on the top of my head. Its cheap and it works so its not all that bad, but you would expect problems occuring a little longer than three months."
3,More Comfortable than the Sony headset,The Logitech one is way moer adjustable and comfortable than the Sony socom 2 headset it comes with 3 different ear piece covers u can put onto the ear piece but it doesnt have the volume and mute conrtol that the sony one has but is alot more comfortable to wear and doesnt make your ears hurt like the Sony made headset does so you can wear it for long periods of time and not have your ear really hurt to the point where you have to take a break from wearing it every once in awhile lol and it seems to be more sturdier than the sony one but one problem they both have is flimsy wires that connect to the ps2 that sometimes break easily i dont know why they didnt make the wire as thick and strong as the conrtoller cord but due to this and other facts most people i know and play with are on their 4th and 5th headsets if only they had a stronger cord and remember this is a problem that both the logitech and sony headsets have.
1,buy some duck tape too,"i'm on my forth pair. they break fairly easy. they last me 6 months, they last my kids 3 months. even if you keep the old ones to canabalize, it's extremely hard to fix them. they should probably sell them for $20 not $30."
3,meh,"This headset is okay. the voice quality is nice and people can here me well. the only major complaint and the only reason i got my trittons, is because this headset hurt my ears so uch i could only game for like 45min and id have to stop. so its okay but it hurts..."
3,Decent Headset.,"The product is decent overall, but just that. decent. bland. the microphone provides adequate sound, and the headphones are decent, but the speaker 'cushion' hurts my ear, it doesn't fit larger heads, made for people with smaller heads, even with the extension."
1,ps3 logitech headset,"This headset is garbage. I don't know about anyone else but we have been through 5 yes FIVE of these headsets in six months. The microphone just stops working. You can hear but they can't hear you. I called the company, they sent me a free one, and it broke! total garbage"
4,good headset,This is a good headset for the ps3. the audio is fairly clear and you can hear audio pretty well. The headset is pretty comfortable as well. This is not the ultimate headset or anything but it's good for playing call of duty and online games.
3,non player,"I purchased this item for my grandson, at first we had a problem getting the headset to work for some reason unknown. Eventually it worked off and on and then we wiggled some fixtures on the headset and most of the time it works properly. We still have a problem with it working from time to time but is acceptable especially considering the last sony blue tooth item that I purchased that lasted about 3 months then stopped working at all, would not recharge and instead of returning the sony bluetooth item we junked it to the junk pile it was a total bust."
4,Good while it lasted,"I am a teen gamer and this was the perfect headset. It was a good size and quite comfortable. The mic was very flexible and easy to adjust. The audio clarity was top-notch, and everybody who I chatted with could hear me perfectly. Unfortunately, due to a mistake on my part, it fell on the floor a lot, because I had put it on the coffee table, and it was yanked to the floor constantly by my cats. I can no longer speak into it, but I can still hear. Be very careful with this product. You can use it for PS2, PS3, and your PC, so it is a good Skype-tool. Please note, there is no mute button or volume control."
3,Mixed bag.,"This headset fit great and was comfortable (unless you intend on gaming for hours on end, which I never did), sounded great, and talked great according to my buddies... but it was broken after six months or so and with only very careful use. I don't know if there's a design flaw with the cord, or what, but I don't have kids and I didn't throw them down a flight of stairs or anything dramatic such as that. It just crapped out on me, one day.I've since gotten the official PS3 bluetooth. While I can't use it with my PC like I could with the Logitech, the bottom line is that the bluetooth has outlasted the Logitech. It isn't nearly as comfortable, it has to be charged frequently, and I doubt it sounds/talks as good as the corded Logitech did... BUT the durability in my opinion makes it a more worthwhile purchase.Pro's -+ Comfortable.+ Doesn't need a charge.+ Sounds good.+ Talks good.Con's -+ Short life-span even with careful use."
2,Good but not great,1- no noise canceling2- mic cannot be muted3- design is a little bit creepy u won't get used to it4- can be broken easily5- can't turn up/down the volumeother than that it's good
2,"Worked Great for 3 months, then died","I loved this headset...when it worked. After three months of use, it died. I used it maybe 12 times. I barely moved it. Not great workmanship."
3,Great For A Backup Headset!,"I purchased this headset to use as a backup when my bluetooth sets battery dies. It's easy to set up and works with minimal hassle. The mic. boom length and overall size is for someone smaller than me (12-14 year olds I guess). The only major draw back is the lack of volume controls on the headset or anywhere else for that matter. Playing R:FoM or CoD4 can be an earache inducing experience! If your Buddies mic. volume is set high and he yells you hear it! I just set the ear cup a little behind my ear and it seems to help. I would have traded the extra ear pads for a volume knob! It's a basic USB set and works well for a ""Spare"" set. If you have a PS3, do yourself a favor and pick up a BT headset for normal use and this USB set for ""Emergency"" use."
3,"Not so good, but Perfect sound quality","The headset sound quality is perfect, but the material used to make the headset, plastic or whatever it is! very flimsy and weak. Very easily breakable. Before i bought this headset, i watched a youtube video of some kid reviewing the headset and he said it's very easy to break the headset and i thought to myself ""Of course. What can't kids break?"", but when i got the headset, i said to myself, ""I should have listened to that kid"". But at least the sound quality is perfect, so all i need to do is take care and not break the flimsy material that made a perfect sounding piece of headset."
1,Mic broke Day 3 of Use,"This headset was great and easy to use for three days.....Then the mic broke. I don't know what happened. It just stopped working. I returned it and am awaiting a refund to purchase another brand. The same thing happened to two of my friends. Too bad, it is comfortable to wear and I wish the mic wouldn't have quit."
2,Kind of silent,"It has a nice feel to it, but when used for my Mac and WoW the volume is terrible. I have to use the external speakers to hear what the person on the other end it saying and unlike most USB headsets, this has no built-in volume control. Works well for the PS3 though."
4,A good mic,Its a good product. it does needs a mute button and it does have cord so if your looking for wireless dont bother but its working well for me.
4,Great headset...but no mute button?,"So I got this headset because I prefer usb headsets over bluetooth, but i only like it on one ear so I can hear the game and things around me as well. Overall it is a great headset voice quality wise, and is pretty good on the comfortable side. The only problem I have with the headset is that it has no mute button, so if someone is talking to me in real life, I have to unplug the headset which gets to be a pain. Now if not having a mute button is not a problem for you, then definitely get this headset, but if having a mute button is a necessity for you, look around for one that has it first."
4,USB Headset for PS2/3,"This product works just fine, the only thing I miss is the volume control that used to be located on the headset itself (old models). This one has to be adjusted through the game settings. No biggie though, great product, love it!"
5,A beautiful pink color,"I love MAC! Especially their lipsticks. I think they are wonderful and the only lippy I want to buy. Even though I do buy other brands at times, I always reach for MAC lipsticks first. They are $14 at the MAC site or store so this was a good buy. I love the colors and the smell of vanilla each lippy has. Girl About Town is a bright pink color in the Amplified category. It's very creamy without glitter or frost and has good staying power. It's somewhat bright like Show Orchid but not as pink. GAT has more yellow in it. It's a beautiful color and matches my medium with yellow undertones skin very well. I love it!"
4,Cutest Snoopy around!,"I have the Snoopy & Family themed bedding, but I liked this hamper better than the one they recommended for my theme. It is easy to assemble and use. My colors are blue & green so this matches perfectly! I didn't have any problems with the quality of the wood; it is the same as hampers of similar quality at local baby stores. If you are particular about sticking to a theme, pay the extra ($12) to get this hamper; you won't be sorry!"
3,Cute and flimsy,"I recently redecorated my almost 1-year old's room in Snoopy Peek a Boo theme, and bought this hamper. It is very very cute, but the wood is so thin that one part of it snapped on the very first day. Also, wood is unfinished so there is a chance you child can get a splinter or too."
3,The wood sucks,"The hamper itself looks good and works really well (I use it for my laundry). Unfortunately, the wood was really thin, dry, and rough. Not to mention, the wood on my hamper was cracked. I wish the wood could have been made with better quality."
5,works,"Kills on contact..Constant monitoring is required to keep infestation down and gradually getting rid of them slowly, it works though."
2,are we talking about the same machine???,"The reviews were all so glowing, I was excited when mine arrived, and the directions were so triflingly easy! But then, after 3 hours of stirring every fifteen minutes, it was still soggy goo. I finally abandoned it overnight, and woke up to rock hard frozen paste. I'll try some sorbets and ices, but for a first attempt at simple coffee ice cream,following instructions and included recipe to the letter, the result was a terrible disappointment."
1,"Price gouging, BIGTIME. A real shame","Five-star product gets one star for the worst price gouging I've ever encountered-I bought this product here in July 2009 for $49 shipped. Went to this page in November 2009 to refer a friend and see that now the price is >>>>$170.00<<< shipped.If anyone is willing to put up with this price gouging (the Midas got a positive review on Cooltools and this fact apparently went to some peoples' heads), be warned that the recipe book is rife with errors: I had to email the factory to learn that the 'gelato' recipes are all fatally flawed*.A shame overall: the Midas makes wonderful ice cream once the recipe is corrected, but not for that kind of money.* The correction: one cup of cream gets heated. The 2nd cup is whipped and added later after the base cools for half an hour. They also specify heavy cream: IMHO light cream actually produces a better, non-greasy product."
5,One of the best books the a have ever read,"I would recommend this book to others because If I can follow this book and enjoy reading this book I am sure everybody else can too. This book picks up right where the other one left off. If you like blood, well then, this is the book for you. This book has a sad, disappointing ending, but also a happy and shocking ending. Like at said at the begining this was a great book and If I enjoyed it then so will you...."
2,not so good,"It was a good book and all but it was just creepy and weird. Almost disturbing, but if u like evil its the one for u."
2,"It was, ok","I thought that Chain Letter was one of Pike's best books but the second one was nothing compared to the first. The ending was very disapointing. It was really, really sad, but too- i don't want to say disapointing, but it was. the story wasn't that good and people died just like that without a chance to try and save them. in all, i didn't like it."
3,It wasn't one of his best.,It was written well but not as good as the first one. You already knew what was was going to happen.
4,Great book to read!,"This was the first book written by Christopher Pike that I read, and after reading it I just bought one book after the other by the same author. I read this book before I read the first one, but I had no trouble following along at all. It does help a little to read the first book, so you know all the characters, but it isn't necessary. This was a great book. It's easy to follow, it has a great plot, and even when you know who the bad guy is, it doesn't take away from the story. Mr.Pike wrote this book with the same style he writes all his books, which makes it great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because sometimes it gets a little gross, but it doesn't go to far. I recommend it to anyone, whether you're a long-time fan of Mr.Pike, or you've just discovered this wonderful author."
4,"a disgustingly satisfying book, better than the first one!","I really liked this book. It was so much nastier then the first one, which held my attention. It's also more suspenseful and the perpetrator of the chain letter is pure evil. I love how that character is written! If u read Chain Letter, you should read this book. It's so much better. And if you havent read it, read the sequel anyways. The story explains itself."
3,it's ok.,i got this b/c i thought the design looked good and it was functional. only thing i do not like is that it covers the cd/dvd slot. it says that it leaves space for the cd to come out but it doesn't.
4,A real guitarist's guitarist flies high,Andy Timmons is a little-known guitarist that any guitarist and/or Hendrix fan must hear. His varied but consistently bluesy distortion solos are just melt-in-your ears good and amazingly catchy. This particular album has very high highs but some meh lows. The great tracks more than make up for the okay ones.
5,Music on guitar ....,"there are two types of guitarist ... those that make great music, which just happens to be played on a guitar ( Steve Morse, Tommy Emmanuel, Johnny A, Eric Johnson, Michael Lee Firkins, Danny Gatton ) and great guitarists who make (some) great music ( Steve Vai, Yngwie, Satch, Greg Koch plus hundreds of others with ""fretboard diarrhoea"").The key to 'which is which' is whether you pick favourite tracks off the album, or whether you listen to it all.I had quite a few Andy Timmons tracks on MP3, and decided to buy the album on the strength of good Amazon reviews. I am WELL pleased I did.Along with other ""unknowns"" like Howard Hart and ( to a leser extent) Neil Zaza, Andy is a fantastic instrumental song writer. He plays exactly like I would love to play, agressive riffing under tuneful leads but never sounding the same ( which, in truth, and I hate myself for saying it, Steve Morse TENDS to ... ouch, should I delete that ?)This is DEFINITELY a CD I play from start to finish ...."
5,music,"andy timmons is a super guitar player in the vain of steve vai , eric johnson , and joe satriani, a very intense and melodic player i think this cd is a must for all guitar players specialy if you have not heard him before..."
2,Waste of money.,My two cats do not like this stuff. And with having to buy 24 cans and then finding out they won't eat it. Don't waste your money.Go to the pet store.
4,Valley of the Shadow,Was initially introduced to the author through one of his textbooks on financial analysis from a business course. The inner leaflet of the textbook discussed Valley of the Shadow and the subject matter seemed interesting. The book covers a rarely discussed aspect of the second world war in the form of the author's personal experiences during the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich. The author and his family experienced tragedies almost unimaginable by today's generations living in the Western World. Highly recommended.
3,First Accident in which people died....,"This was not the first nuclear accident in the US, but people died. The first accident on a large scale would be RFNWP and and Mayak, RU, and the continual testing of this manmade disaster that affected not only the US but world wide as other countries contributed to the worldwide disaster in the name of peace.This will affect all of us living today and those grandchildren, our food, water and soil and air. It's nearly impossible to repair the damage and there is no such thing as clean energy. We are stressing the planet's reserves and we are our own worst enemy. God help us all."
3,Memories of Realities,"I did the calculations and wrote the Safety Analysis Report for the SL-1 reactor. It was called ALPR back then. I did the ""worst case scenario"" and we studied it. Our design and tools used common sense equipment recognizing what could possibly go badly wrong. Several years later I was shocked to see the headlines of the Chicago Tribune reporting the explosion at SL-1. No secret! Years of studies afterwards revealed that the military operators had made handling tools of their own that short-cutted our common-sense approach. One of these shortcuts turned out to be a weak link in a system that had its own inherent vulnerabilities. I'll read the book. But I doubt that any new secrets are revealed. The AEC extensively revised its safety criteria after the accident. All public information."
2,Sloppily done and biased.,"My father, William Gammill, was the first health physicist on site. He was one of the ones to actually go into the reactor building in an effort to save the operators; an action for which he and four others received a Carnegie Heroes Medal. To portray them as McKeown did was insulting and false,anyone that called him ""nerdy"" or worse clearly didn't know anything about him. They performed with heroism that few of us will ever match. He and William Rausch were still alive during the period that the book was written yet was not even mentioned and neither were interviewed. Very sloppy indeed.This reviewer is the son of William P. Gammill and remembers well the night that his dad went rushing out into the night not knowing whether he was going to be returning. I also discussed the book with him before his death in October of 2008. Shame on McKeown."
4,quite interesting,"I read this book while visiting my son in Idaho Falls this summer. I found it quite interesting, so much so that I drove the fifty miles or so out of the city into the Lost River desert, and toured the facility where nuclear energy was first generated back in 1951.This is a well-written book, and I thought the author did a fine job of presenting all sides of this little-known mystery."
1,Worst cooker ever.,"After a couple of attempts to get one that actually works (not from Amazon), we've given up. The first one we got never bothered to stop the cooking process until the lever was forced up. The rice burned every time. Returned. The button on the second one we got never wanted to stay down and cook. Returned. The same with the third attempt... ugh!! We're just using it temporarily now until we find a better model. We use scotch tape to hold down the lever to cook it and use an egg timer to estimate the cooking time. What a waste of time, effort, and money. Very disappointed since I've always thought of Oster as a good brand name kitchen product. Wish I could give it zero stars. :("
1,Makes a big mess,"Let me first say that I live at high altitude (over 5000 feet) so that might contribute to my issues.First, if I cook 2 cups of rice or less the bottom always scorches, which I can live with. Forget about making one cup of rice, half of it ends up as a toasted crust.The big issue is that it boils too rapidly and uncontrollably so that the escaping steam exceeds the capacity of the vent in the lid. This causes the lid to rattle and condensed water to spray all over the counter. I have to put a towel on it or under it to soak up the mess every time I run it. It sprays more than a quarter cup of water all over my counter. I would not recommend this appliance to anyone unless you like to clean up a big wet mess every time you use it."
4,timely film,"This is a wonderful film and the subject matter could not be more timely. The actors, the locations are all perfectly selected."
4,Acrobat 8,"The vendor was very good. Shipped promptly and the item was well packed.If you are planning to use this product on a 64 bit OS, (ie Vista or Win 7) this is not the product for you. I did manage to get it installed by resorting to a work around, but the Acrobat printer still doesn't work correctly."
2,Tough to Study From,"This book lacked a lot of good application and learning activities. Subsequently, my college Spanish professor dropped it halfway through the school year for a different text."
5,A must have in the Titanic collection,"I have lots of books about different ships in the early 1900's and tons of books on Titanic and this one is one of my favorites.I liked how all three ships are together and there are some rare photos.There are photos of the ships going through construction, in dry dock and at launch. There is lots of interesting information listed about the White Star Line as well."
4,Titanic and Her Sisters Olympic and Britannic,"It is a good book, well worth the price, but I have one complaint-it has a few errors in captions.(For example, Titanic's aft Grand Staircase [not as grand as the forward one] was mistaken for Olympic's forward Grand Staircase. Yes, there are differences-Olympic's forward Grand Staircase was just as grand as Titanic's forward staircase.)Aside from a few captioning errors, it is a wonderful book, a must have for an Olympic, Titanic, and Britannic enthusiast. Pictures are wonderful, saw so many things that couldn't be seen otherwise."
4,The Guernseyman,"I found this book a little on the slow side with not enough action at sea. However, DeLancey is likable for all of that, despite his propensity to social climb. I think Parkison is better than most people credit and should give him a second try."
2,Disappointing,"I can't agree with most of these reviews. I am an O'Brian and Forester veteran and I don't think this book is on the same level at all. The writing is somewhat stilted and at times he gets lost in his own plot. Perhaps the other books are better, but I don't plan to find out."
1,NO STARS - This Book is Rubbish!,"This book was cobbled together from a series of 12 (generally) badly written Children's books - the only good one was the last one on warfare post-45. How do I know this? I was the editor asked to do the cobbling and I was unhappy with the whole project due to the poor quality of the original material and the constraints of budget and time. Although in no way am I the author of this book my name was put on the cover of the book, without my knowledge or permission. Don't be a sucker, don't buy this book! If you want an encyclopedia of warfare/military history buy the one by R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N Dupuy, or A History of Warfare by John Keegan."
4,My husband and I found that the Trojan-Enz ...,"My husband and I found that the Trojan-Enz Spermicidal Lubricated Latex Condoms worked as well as other Trojan brand condoms that we've tried. He found the sensitivity about the same as other popular brands ... no more, no less. I'd recommend this brand of condoms for anyone who wants to participate in safe sex."
4,I feel safer knowing that it's spermicidal. The ...,"I feel safer knowing that it's spermicidal. The condom feels like any other condom. Actually, I think that it's a little thinner than the regular kind that Trojan puts out. But from my sense it still feels like a normal condom. But you feel more at ease, knowing that you have spermidal stuff there."
4,This is an excellent product. My wife and ...,"This is an excellent product. My wife and I both enjoyed testing this particular product. I didn't like the loss of sensitivity, but I liked the birth control factor (we definitely don't want any more children!). I'd recommend this to friends and family members."
4,Interesting and Believable,"Very believable storyline, and empathy for main character. This book keeps moving and holds your interest, can't put it down."
5,Gary Anglin & The Voices of CCC,"Once again, as a member of Christian Cultural Center Gary Anglin has done it again. We at Christian Cultrual Center were blessed to be the first to hear this music live, in our sanctuary before it's release. We are so Blessed to be a part of this experience as we worship with Gary Anglin on Sunday mornings."
1,Veryfasttalkingprofessorthatyoucannotunderstand,"I know what the first guy was talking about. I'm in my last semester and evidence is my last exam. I have always used audio lectures to prepare for exams and the Sum & Substance series has always been good. But this one is horrendous. This is not a professor giving a lecture, this is an auctioneer selling cattle. I never imagined someone could speak so fast. Sometimes his talking becomes just a rapid-fire spurt of syllables and he sounds much like a machine gun. There's no time to take notes or think about what he's saying. Avoid these tapes."
3,Overall Good,Good product in general. Could be better if it would recognize more video formats and would have a way for continuous file playing.
1,What a waste of time !! Coby sucks,"I bought this player a week back, only reason being was tempted by the price and features. Thought I knew the reviews were bad but thought of trying it out..............Turned out to be a big mistake !!!This piece of junk, didnt start at all !! I mean how bad a PMP can be !! Putting in and taking out the Battery from this giant seems a next to impossible task. Thanks to JR Electronics, they took it back. Over all, what a waste of time and this is a total piece of Junk !!"
5,LOVE this CD!!!,"I am a big fan of the Garfield comics, cartoon series, and movies. I LOVE this CD. The music on it is very fun and catchy and is the perfect music for Garfield and his sassy spunky-ness! I love to dance to it and put it on when I work out! I am a very satisfied customer!"
4,Garfield: The Movie,"I got this soundtrack for my [kid] and he wakes up to it every morning for school. He really seems to enjoy it and hums all the songs through out the day. It's kind of funny to hear a 6 year old singing ""IT FEELS GOOD!"""
2,Does NOT fit my 2000 Chrysler Voyager,"Despite the included instructions claiming that this works for a 2000 Chrysler Voyager minivan, it does not. I have the dash version with two A/C vents above the radio, not 3. And my radio has 2 3/8"" taps holding it in on the lower left and upper right corner, not 4 screws at each corner. In my van, the hole was about 3/16 inch too narrow for this kit, and there was simply no way I could get it to work. I'm going to try one of the kits listed for the 2000 Plymouth Voyager next...like the Metra 99-6229."
3,Does what it needs to do... barely.,"Installed in my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The unit fits fairly well, just leaves an ever-so-small-but-still-annoying gap at the bottom. The Pocket is absolutely useless because it's so small. One of the plastic mounting points snapped off very easily.Overall, it works, but could be designed better."
2,Not for Dodge Rams,Read the discription carefully this will NOT fit your Dodge. There is a bit of ambiguity in the discription on this one......
4,Fit In My 2006 Dodge Stratus Sedan,This dash kit was easy to figure out and install. It fit pretty decently in my 2006 Dodge Stratus Sedan.
3,Worked,"This worked and it looks good in, but the instructions were a little weak and the piece does not fit firmly in the mount."
5,GREAT!,I got what I ordered without any issues and in a timely manner. Thank you very much! I am please with this mount! Fits and works perfectly.
4,metra dash kit,"does what it says it fit my grand cherokee easily and simply ,but if you have a removable face plate ,put it on first before you install,also with this fitment you dont need the metal cage as this fitment bolts straight on to the radio,"
1,Wrong Description,This item shows that it will fit 98-up Jeep. Got the item in and it doesn't fit 2000 Jeep Cherokee. Amazon needs to update their product description.
5,GREAT!,"Wasn't sure if I wanted the pocket kit, but I tried it and it looks great! It fit perfect and was very simple to use.The pocket is too narrow to fit CD in case or my remote but it will hold a loose cd and it looks like it came from the factory that way."
4,Not Bad,"This thing actually worked well. Was easy to assemble. looks pretty good. it had a minor hiccup with securing the deck, but the ring that surrounds the head unit secures it in the end. I would recommend this, although if you have a iphone 4 with a case, even a slim case, it will not fit in the pocket."
5,Used on a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan,Easy to follow instuctions for several different car models- most vehicles(including mine) require only a phillips tip screwdriver. Makes the new stereo look like it came with the vehicle. Rememeber you still need the appropriate stereo wiring harness and antenna adapter to complete the installation as these ae not pat of the kit.
2,tried twice to get right part and failed,I had to ask for a refund due to the item not being as advertised. It does not fit a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500. The need to make an dffort to check these things out
1,dash kit,This product did not fit my 1999 dodge ram and i think the system is very misleading. Whose ever in charge of processing this product should be very specific about the proper fit for the vehicles being requested.
2,does not fit dodge ram as advertised,"I double checked with manufacturer before I bought this and was sure it was correct but this unit did not fit my sons Ram.Top and bottom were fine but I had to take the bezel and grind off the lip on both side to get it to work. I will never be able to put factory back in also the bracket only had ONE bolt hole that would match up this is VERY poorly described ""to fit""."
5,Item as described.,"Seems like Amazon forces you to write a review, they keep on emailing you. Well here it goes, I paid for what I got. My dealer did ship it out quickly. Other than that, nothing else to report."
5,Excellant Purchase,"Very nice product and will add the finishing touch to the intake manifold when installed. The price of this product alone would not qualify for Free Shipping, however, it was included with the other purchases that I made for this build. Great product, fast delivery."
5,Worship can't possibly get better than this.....,"There aren't even words to describe the kind of feeling I get singing along with these songs. I'm quite the youngin' (19 to be exact), and this music hits the spot with me! This is the kind of worship I can get into!You Are Worthy of My Praise-Barlowgirl/Big Daddy Weave: BEST worship song! I love singing this one in church as well as along with the CD!! Barlowgirl is such a fantastic group of girls singing about the issues teenage girls face these days. I got my cousins ages 9-14 listening to this music, and they LOVE it. So I would also recommend the Barlow Girls CD.Alot of the songs on this CD I've heard on radio stations such as K-Love. These songs are really hitting home with a lot of people I know. They can just pop this CD into the CD player and just get lost in it, which is such a blessing. Please, buy this CD! You won't regret it for a moment!"
2,OK ... for the price,"These tools are functional but are low cost/moderate quality Chinese imports. If you love good tools, you will be better off spending more for a better quality set."
1,Buy USA instead,These are cheap for a reason. Made in Taiwan. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a set from Channellock. They will be the last set you ever buy.
5,Irwin Tool Package,"The quality of Irwin tools has been superior for years. With this set, they exceeded my expectations. The coated handles are comfortable to use, the set is a good compilation of the tools I use, and the manufacturing detail exceeds Craftsman. A great package!"
5,"super quality pliers,....",I think these pliers are nice enough to pass on to my children...I take good care of my tools and especially quality pliers like these...a really good value...a nice case to wrap them up in...and of course with Amazon GoldBox value and Prime shipping a good price for good tools...sAlso a lot of slip joint pliers are difficult to keep a good grip on the item being fixed...these hold a very stable non-slip grip for a large variety of jobs .....
4,Good Pliers Set,Set comes in handy for DIY jobs around the house and on my cars.Seems well made....Kinda disappointed to see that they are now made in china instead of the USA.I use the set occasionally so cannot speak on how they will stand up to daily duty.Kit also includes a nice roll up storage pouch.
1,Need to be Made in the USA again..,I will never again buy a set of visegrip pliers until Irwin brings production tot eh USA> the new pliers are junk.
4,Case needs work,"The tools are fantastic, I had the need to use them the day after they arrived and it was great to have them in one place when I needed them. The case however is another question. You have to be sure not to turn it over when carrying it, some of the tools slip out, and there is not anything to prevent them from sliding out of the top of the case."
5,pot roast heaven,"Picked this up at a local half priced books store. 5 star rating for the Braised Beef and Vegetable (aka Pot Roast) recipe alone. I have a 3 1/2 qt pot so I had to half the recipe but done right this has become a sunday standard for entire whole family (including a picky 9 yr old eater). I also recently modifed the dish by replacing the chuck roast with chicken thighs and legs, using white wine, white balsamic, and chicken stock, with spectacular results. Like some other reviews have stated this book is built 100% for a ceramic dutch oven (le creuset); that being said, if you have said dutch oven and can find this book used, buy it - you won't be disappointed."
2,Not your standard dutch oven,Be for warned that this book is not about using the good ole' cast iron oven on an open fire. This book is aimed at cooking in your oven in your kitchen. Because of this I was very dissappointed. The dutch oven this book is refering to is ceramic inside and out.
3,Too much fat,"I looked through it and saw 4-5 usable recipes (at least ""usable"" for me).Too many ""seventies"" recipes with added bacon fat or using a stick of butter.I'm 50 and would like to see 60. The baked bean and pork recipes look great thoughand will post a followup when we make them this weekend. Not a bad book."
4,FOR THOSE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN TRANSLATION AND COMPARATIVE LITERATURE...,"EXTREMELY INTERESTING, VERY UP-TO-DATE SCHOLARLY WORK,SEMINAL TO THOSE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN TRANSLATION STUDIES AND COMPARATIVE LITERATURE IN OUR ""GLOBALIZED"" WORLD...I VERY MUCH RECOMMEND THE READING OF THIS BOOK.PROF. JOSÉ ANTÓNIO COSTA IDEIASNEW UNIVERSITY OF LISBON (FCSH-UNL), PORTUGAL , EUROPEMODERN GREEK AND COMPARATIVE LITERARY/CULTURAL STUDIES"
5,Own Three Pair,We've used one of our three pair of Joyce Chen kitchen scissors for twenty years. We recently bought two more pairs because someone always had the first pair somewhere other than the kitchen. Great scissors for many uses. Very durable and comfortable.
3,Great,I have 20 year old pair that are the best. Nothing anywhere compares to there strenght ease of use. I wanted a couple more the the same I had from 20 yrs ago. I ordered a couple of these new ones and they are now made a little differently. These changes make them not nearly as good as the original. An example of big compamy buying namebrand to get market share then making changes to product to lower manufacturing cost. These are still alot better than most.
5,best scissors ever,"after a recommendation by a friend, I picked these up and use nothing but these scissors in the kitchen. These are by far the best scissors for any application in the kitchen."
5,THE BEST KITCHEN SCISSORS!,"I bought these kitchen scissors about a year ago and use them every day.They are unbelievably tough/stout and yet delicate. The handles are large enough to accommodate large hands and provide significant leverage for cutting through tough items like small bones and plant stems. But, the blades are fine enough and precise enough to allow for detailed cutting, as needed.Don't let the looks and price deceive you. You may think these are ""as seen on TV"" items but they are far far better than you'd think, just looking at a picture.I also own a pair of Wusthoff kitchen scissors, but I always reach for the Joyce Chen's."
5,Trojans march on ...... quickly !,"Seems like only a few days past since I ordered them, and they arrived on the 7th. Warp speed I must say ! Plus, the fact that I cannot find non-lubricated condoms anywhere, and the Great price I got them for pleases me to no end."
3,"Good, but now a bit out of date","The book is well-written, fairly thorough, and deals with all of the main aspects of the Tablet PC. It is lacking, however, in Office 2003 application discussions.There have been numerous changes in Office 2003 that afect the Tablet PC, and this book should be updated to include them.It's one of the thicker books at over 400 pages, but it doesn't talk about a lot of the newer hardware and software that is covered in books such as ""Absolute Beginner's Guide to Tablet PCs.""I've read all of the Tablet PC books, and this is good, but may deal a bit too much in the standard Windows XP side to be as useful for Tablet PC users.Don't get me wrong - there is lots of material on Tablet PC-specific usage, just not scenarios on how to effectively use the Tablet PC, or detailed information on the more esoteric applications and hardware accessories."
2,Not for experienced Windows users,"If you know how to use Windows XP, then this book isn't for you. About 20% of the book is aimed specifically at using the Tablet PC, the rest is basic operating system information that anyone who knows how to use Windows XP should know. This book was basically a review of Windows XP concepts with a couple chapters focused specifically on the Tablet PC."
2,break easy and die fast,"I have bought several set of these. The ground stems break real easy, the light is very dim even after a full day of sun. Save the money and buy better ones"
1,"horrible, highly processed dishes","I should have known that there is catch in preparing dishes with only four ingredients--use highly processed canned goods. Yuck!!! I've prepared five dishes and all of them were inedible. My kids would not touch them. All the dishes smell like they came out of a truly horrible, hole in the wall diner. The dishes are quick and easy but gourmet???? There is nothing sophisticated about these dishes.If you like preparing dishes in a flash and you like the taste of canned goods, then this is the cookbook for you. If you want a little more sophistication in your meals, you need to use fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh herbs, etc. If you like food that taste like it has been sitting at a diner for a week, then this cookbook is excellent. Do your heart and body and palate a favor and stay away from this cookbook."
4,easy to use,I liked this watch alot. It was very easy to program. The strap that goes around the chest is a bit uncomfortable for a woman thats well endowed. I still just use the watch for everyday ware. If you want to see your pulse i suggest you just take it manually.
5,Great HR monitor!,"This is a great HR monitor -- the midsized watch unit is smaller than many competitor's models, making it much more comfortable to wear. The software is intuitive. In addition to the standard features you would expect (average HR, minimum HR, time in zone, calorie count for workout), the unit ALSO records peak HR, average heart rate for splits/laps along with split/lap time, and calculates calorie use for all effort levels (vs. some Polar HR monitors which only calculate calorie use at higher activity levels). All at a very affordable price."
3,"Great watch, mediocre heart sensor..","I love the watch and sensor, when it worked. I had to replace the battery after only one use. Put in a fresh battery and got to use it for one work out. Then it just stopped transmitting. Major disappointment because I loved the set up. This is the first time a Timex product failed me."
2,"The watch is good, but the straps","I bought this HRM for my wife together with another Times HRM. The watch is good and it has a lot of functions, however, the strap is a waste of money. My one broke in 6 months. It broke in the junction of the middle part and the part that has the heart sensor. I took it to a technical assistance that replaced it, but it last 4 months. My wife's one had the same problem after 16 months. I think that Timex should look into this product (strap) to find out how to fix this problem."
3,Timex IronMan Heart-Rate Monitor,"Good Deal. Buttons are a little weird. You get 5 buttons, which is certainly way more than one would need, but they are assigned poorly.The instructions are poor when it gets to the advanced features. BasicSetup of the watch, alarm, modes and use of the stop-watch or timer are fairly well explained. Use of the Heart-Rate Monitor is poorly explained through all three books ... everybody expects you to go somewhere else.Most troublesome is that there is a manual-setting for the hear-rate range but no instruction at all on how to set it to an upper and lower limit range which has been prescribed by a qualified coach or physician. It is not too hard to figure out how to select one of the built-in ranges.I have not been able to figure out how to set it, myself.So I just look at the thing every minute or so and check to see if I'm where I ought to be ... probably better to pay attention to it myself anyway."
4,Keeps on ticking,"Great watch for HRM.Only thing I wish it did more of was multiple countdowns. I can set a single countdown, or use chrono laps, but neither are perfect for varying interval training times."
3,"If this is the midsize, where is the small? Band way too large","I'm a 5'9"" small-framed athlete, and I could not wear this watch. There simply weren't enough holes in the band for it to sit flush on my wrist. Not to mention the strap is looooooooooooong. I mean, comically long. My 5'7"" male trainer put it on and was on one of the first holes. If your wrist is remotely small, there will be a huge excess of strap hanging off the end, and due to the design, it would look wrong if cut off. I had to return it. Too bad - the face size is nice for a woman's small wrist, but with the seemingly dozen other holes in the band, I had to wonder - if you're using the outermost hole, well that would look ridiculous. The face would then look miniscule on that wrist."
3,"Great when it works, BUT....","I bought this because it had all the functionality I wanted AND cool sporty style to wear casually. This is my second Timex watch. I thought it was just me, but now I realize that these watches just aren't well made. The first watch was great until after 6 mos. the chest strap began to malfunction. The other comments are correct in that there are times i would look at my Heart Rate and it would reflect a figure that was totally incorrect. The second watch same thing AND one of the loops on the wrist band mysteriously broke off and disapeared. I ran a marathon clipping the band to the wrist so that the watch wouldn't fall off. Unfortunately, i'm gonna have to buy my 3rd heart rate monitor in a 1 yr timeframe and it won't be this one..."
3,Fun colors and scents. And the scent wasn't ...,"Fun colors and scents. And the scent wasn't too strong although I'm unsure if this is what I really want in a condom. These appeared to be well made, unlike some novelty-type condoms. I had no difficulty using these, and they have well-written instructions for proper use. No problems with breakage."
4,Not for individual brick making,"When I bought this item, I was going to use it to make individual colored bricks to make a raised brick flower bed. I didn't realize the dividers didn't go all the way to the ground, rather they only go about half way thru the brick (Which turns out to be more work in the end having to remove the excess)I'm still giving it 4 stars because it would make a great walkway if being used for that."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I think this has to be the worst condom ever. No feeling at all. I think you'd get more feeling out of a bike tire innertube. I mean I condone safe sex, but this is just straight paranoia. You are just asking for a night full of frustration with these. I would recommend anything from Durex, particularly from the extra sensitive line. They may cost a little more, but beleive me they are well worth it, and just as durable."
5,Truely Blessed!!!!!,I must say that this CD really blessed me cause it has something to say on everything you're going through in your life. Purchase this CD and be blessed also.
3,Tori Keychain,"I love anything Tori related so I am a bit Bias, however I do have other more recent Keychains that I think may be a better buy. It all depends on your own opinion and how you like to see her in photographs. I wish there were musical Tori Key Rings out there..lol"
4,This movie made me happy! :),"I really liked this movie. I too saw it with my family (10 year old son, 13 year old daughter and husband) and we all liked it. I think it all comes down to the fact that we're happiest when we're feeling connected to other people and I think there's been enough research over the last decade to support this. It was interesting to note that extreme happiness and sadness are both short lived in that we all pretty much have a happiness set point that we revert back to quite quickly. When I think of all the mindless drivel we could have watched on a Sunday night I have to say that I think this movie was well worth my family's time. It was positive, sweet, informative and heart-warming and made us feel more connected because we watched it together."
3,Research on What Makes People Happy,"Not a ""Happy"" movie but more of a movie about what makes people happy. Interesting to watch and good to know your not the only one asking yourself why your on the hamster wheel called 'progress'.I'll watch again with the family."
5,Good film,I really enjoyed this documentary! I think if we all lived a more simple life and connected more with our community and family that we would all be happier. I felt good after watching this film.
4,Good to think about...,"After seeing this I asked everyone I knew what their 4 happiest, jump up and down, I'm going to explode moments in life were. If you know what they are, you can have them more often! :)"
2,Happy didn't make me so happy...,"I was kind of underwhelmed by this documentary. it had good intentions, but i didn't really get any message out of it besides ""you can be happy despite your socioeconomic conditions."""
2,A MOVIE DEPICTING HAPPINESS IN VARIOUS WAYS,The movie was well done. I enjoyed it somewhat. But it was not what I expected in content. It was unusual.
2,Happy?,"Just a OK movie. No earth shattering revelations, so I was a little disappointed. More around the world experiences and paths to find happiness would have been nice."
3,Happy DVD,"Documentary arrived on time and in good condition. $14.50 (new) was too much to pay, but it's a worthwhile film with interesting subject matter and intelligent speakers."
3,So-so,"This documentary was decent. The message from the filmmakers is clear, it's not money, status, or image that will make you happy - it's intrinsic goals like personal growth, relationships, and desire to help community that create happiness.I didn't learn any new insights. I've heard of most of the information presented in the film."
5,Great documentary to watch!,"Enjoyed watching it to put everything into perspective. Will recommend to family and friends to also watch! Americans are too focused on money, fame, etc and its not the right path to happiness!"
1,DVD does not work,"DVD stops after about 10 minutes. Clean it and it may or may not continue 10 more minutes. Enough to drive you crazy. I am not willing to return such an inexpensive item--takes up too much time to package. My time is money, too."
3,Happy,"It was okay, nothing special. I don't have anything good or bad to say about it, mostly, neutral. That is all."
4,Interesting documentary,An interesting aspect was the fact that so many scientist study depression and so few study what makes us happy. It is interesting how we as Americans who have so much struggle to be happy when people around the world who have virtually nothing are way happier.
4,Very good Movie,"Interesting ,uplifting, realistic. Anything to help make the world a better place and me a better and happier person. We all need reminding of what really should matter."
1,Awfully astonished,"""I'm astonished, this is just absurd. When I bought the product it didnt have the description showing at the moment. So instead of getting a completely assembled car, I got a huge load of parts and very mediocre chassis made out of plastic and colorless. I'm indignant. I will definitely never buy again from them."""
1,Crazy Puzzles Kids Love,My 6th and 8th grade math students request these puzzles on testing days! I use them as fillers when waiting for the whole class to finish a test. The students LOVE them!
4,"Brazil in ""new"" music","This CD it's the new ""vouge"" of Brazilian Music, but in a very conservative way.The ""melodia"" it's always a remember of the ""brazilian tradition"".The arists are of the top level like :Suba, Bossacucanova, Carlos Lyra, Bebel Gilberto, Zuco 103, Roberto Menescal, Cibelle, Celso Fonseca, Erlon Chaves, Trio Mocotò.The final result it's a louge brazilian music with happines and ""tristessa"".The beautiful voices are the strong point but also where there is an instrumental song like : Cosa Nostra (Raw Deal Remix), the result it's very nice.Note that there is a ""Tanto Tempo"" in version Remix of Peter Kruder.Less that one hour (57 minuts) of good ""now"" brazilian music.A must if you like this ""great"" country."
4,Great for anyone visiting or living here,"Totally agree about the locals comment. I just moved here from San Francisco and found great stuff in the book to make me feel like a native. Well-written, funny, entertaining, and a great resource for anyone visiting or living here!"
5,"Good, but not Vissi's best.","This album has a lot of good songs. Re, Eime Poli Kala, E Varka, Amin, Eleni, and and Perodico. Anna's songs are all good on this but those stand out the most. This is when Anna was earning her reputation. I recomend this to Anna's Fans. I love this album."
5,Excellent supplement for your main sequencer library,"Great book on MIDI sequencing emphasizing sound quality and creative quantization techniques. Lots of high concept material, backed up with specific routines for the four major sequencers. I own Digital Performer. The advice was a great supplement to the books I already use. The author recommends knowing how to use more than one sequencer. So the advice given on all four will help anyone choose a second sequencer, if they can afford one."
5,Powerful vocals and beautiful music**Ms. Patti is awesome!,"Not often do you hear a gospel song with such flavor*Meaning, when the artist just let go and let God lead their voice...The vocals by Ms. Patti are unbelievable and the music is supberb.I was fortunate enough to see Ms. Patti perform ""Way Up There"" in June 03 in Beaumont, Tx. She had the audience in tears. As usual, she just let go and tore the song up. I have seen her probably a dozen times over the years and her performances are consistently captivating.....She is truely one of God's working soldiers....Much love to Patti LaBelle and she is always in my prayers**** S.Bryant/Missouri City, Tx."
3,The Monster Garden,"This story is about a lonley girl, who try's to make a friend, a sibling- A MONSTER? Vivien Alock writes about a girl who wants to prove to her father that she loves him, and more than anything she wants him to love her. One day she makes an absured deal with her brother, for a little bit of the substance he got from his dad's laboratory, the only problem is the monster is growing fast, very fast. He starts living in a hutch, but when he escapes from the hutch, everyone knows he cant stay a secret for long. The monster garden is a very injoyable book especially for young readers."
4,don't want to put it down,"I bought this book without reviewing it first, and am pleased to say that it was hard to put down. The charcters almost seem real and the action is riveting. You really start to feel for Carmen with everything she gets herself and Julia into."
5,"The Low GI Diet Cookbook: 100 Simple, Delicious...","This book is excellent, it allows you to have delicious easy to prepare meals that are GOOD for you. I would say this book will make it easy for you to stay on and even enjoy the Low GI diet concept."
1,Not a good book if you have PCOS,"I was lead to this cookbook because of my searches related to PCOS. And, though PCOS patients need to monitor their blood glucose levels, this cookbook called for a lot of ingredients that are not recommended for PCOS patients. This is the ONLY reason I was unhappy with the book. I ended up giving it to my father-in-law who has diabetes as many of the recipes did look appetizing, otherwise, I would have sent it back."
2,Not very useful,Not many of the recipes were useful on an everyday basis. My style of cooking did not work well with the recipes presented
2,"Lots of spices, very little taste","I have tried a few recipes that required several new spices, smelled good, but were virtually flavorless. I won't be trying anymore. A total disappointment."
3,The Low GI Diet Cookbook,"I wish I had gone to a bookstore and looked at this book before purchasing it. True, it is a beautiful book and has some good recipes; however, it is too close to gourmet for me to use. To make proper use of the recipes, I would have to revamp my pantry. I am a diabetic single senior adult and I am not up for a complete pantry re-do."
5,Very Yummy!!,"Every single recipie that I have tried is easy to make and tastes wonderful!! My husband and I really enjoy the Pork chops with Honey Glazed Apples (pg 135) and the Beef and Noodles with Chile Jam (pg 111). It's hard to find recipies that are Low GI, taste good, don't require odd ingredients and give you lasting energy -- this cook book offers all of that!!"
1,This is NOT the version to buy!!!,"To those of you that LOVE Deep Purple as I do, wait... wait just a little while longer. Help is on the way. The OFFICIAL version of the California Jam Deep Purple gig on DVD is to be released soon... so say the folks at Purple-Records.com. I bought one of these South American knock-offs from a seller on eBay and... well, it sux. My old VHS version I got mail-order from Japan in 1984 still looks and ESPECIALLY sounds soooooo much better than these cheap DVD's being sold out of South America. Just wait a little while longer, and keep an eye on the Deep Purple website, theHighwayStar.com for news of the official release. I know it will be worth waiting for. Trust me on this one folks. Nobody collects DP video like I have over the years... nobody."
4,MAS NEGRO......ES UN FILM SUPER NEGRO Y BIEN HECHO!,"Las actrices de este film TODAS estan muy bien. Hay suspenso y tiene una historia creible y nada glorificada.Es un gusto ver a estas buenisimas artistas en los 70 que ahora ellas son unas actrices adoradas.Lucia Mendez, Claudia Islas, Susana Dosamantes y Helena Rojo todas son super guapas, queridas, y lo mejor de Mexico."
4,an entertaining horror film.,"This film deals with four young women who move into an old house inherited by one of them, and the supernatural incidents that occur to them after they move in, the film is well cast and uses suspense rather than gore to create an aura of doom, although it could have been better edited it is one of the better horror films to come out of Mexico. It was directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada, who also directed the great suspense horror film Hasta el viento tiene miedo(1967)and the more recent Very good thriller Veneno para las hadas (1984), and the lesser supernatural film El Libro de Piedra (1968). This film is an entertaining suspense horror film and will entertain most people."
5,Awesome,"This was my first purchased paintball marker, and it did not disappoint. Durable, accurate, easily upgradeable. This gun will always be in my collection, it rocks."
2,Noooo,"Do you like guns that shoot in extremely unpredictable ways? Then get it!Let's go over the Pro's and Con'sPro'sIt's easy and comfortable to holdYou can actually get some speed into it (need a good hopper)Con'sSightings suck.Sucks Co2Broke numerous balls but never ever had a problem in any other gunExpensive on this websiteAim is Sh**Your best bet is not to buy it, no matter how cool you think it looks, don't get it. Get a Tippmann. Tippmann's are incredible, they are so upgradable its crazy. Tippmann 98 Custom (or Pro) or possibly the A5.I own the 98 custom and it packs a punch. Easy to move about aim and shoot, and clean!.Luckily the gun was easy to send back at wal-mart, I even kept the barrel plug and an allen key by accident and they notice."
3,Meh...,I Bought this product and it was backordered so it took 2 and 1/2 weeks to get to me...and if that wasn't bad enough it didn't come with the free Gloves or Squeege...other than that...The gun is freaking awesome!
3,"Decent for what it is, and for the price, worthwhile.","I've been using this for a while now, and while it's not nearly as good as the Pimsleur method, it's much cheaper and has its uses. The lessons are very short in duration, so you can use these CDs on your shorter trips in your car.If you're willing to put forth a bit more effort, I would advise taking the time to make flashcards of the vocabulary on the tapes as you go through the lessons. There are booklets that come with the CDs that have this information. If you use them in your spare moments, it'll help with retention and also help you learn the cyrillic alphabet.While I can't really recommend any non-Pimsleur ""listen only"" method as a stand alone product, as part of a larger language learning program these CDs could be useful."
4,Nothing can make Russian easy for a late starter,I got a lot for my money - more Russian lessons than I will be able to master. I am a 65 year old rank beginner! Russian has sounds none of the other languages I know have. It is daunting. I loaded Learn In Your Care Russian CD's into my Ipod so they go everywhere with me and after 4 weeks i am up to lesson 6! But the pronunciation comes through very clearly on these CDs. I'm afraid that the local speakers in different parts of Russia have very different accents.
1,lacks cohesive presentation,"I have used several language learning programs and this is the least helpful one I have ever seen. Only one Russian speaker (female)and English translator is male.. no conversation, no context, difficult to learn. I feel I wasted my money. Pimsleur is much better, although it lacks reading skills."
2,"Cheap, but not very useful","Basically, this CD is just an audio Russian-English dictionary. You can use it to pick up a few words, but it is very tedious way to learn. It doesn't go far in describing how to construct entire sentances."
3,Too list-oriented,"When first going to Russia I listened to this on Delta heading to live in Moscow for a few years. I think that very little stuck to me. I have bought lots of these Russian tutorials and this seems to me to be one of the least useful. Try a Transparent or Rossetta course instead. This basically gives you long lists of words and their definitions. It's just not the most efficient way to learn -- you need more context than this.If you are just cramming to visit Russia, my advice is to get Cyrillic down cold and study some traveler's phrase book on the plane. You can find many tutorials on Cyrillic for free. You'll be stunned at how much you can figure out once you get the alphabet down."
4,Lovely Moon&Stars wallborder,"I have bought this wallborder for my son's room. And I am so happy that I did that. It looks fantastic. It matches very well his moon & stars themed white fournitures.It was not that easy to put it on the wall as there is no glue on it. But it doesn't matter. The result is more important.I recommend this wallborder especially to the parents expecting a babyboy who don't want to have a ""classic boyish"" theme like train, bear, zoo, car.etc..."
3,TOO MANY DETAILS!,"i have to give credit to the authors of this book for just the cheer volume of research they have done.But..a lot of stuff just get's lost in to many details. Again we have a murder theory...with little proof, a lot of speculation,unseen sources and not much physical evidence. It is an interesting read,tracing marilyn's last few weeks of Life. I guess it all depends what your own theorys are to wether you are impressed by this book. I personally recommend Donald Spoto's biography ""Marilyn"" for some down to earth writing."
3,Entertaining holiday reading.,As an Australian we love reading about America where it all happens. I was 12 years old and living in a small country town when Marilyin died and I thought it was a girl living two blocks over. I cried in school all day.
5,Read it if you can find it,"I bought this book at a used book store and loved it. Now, of course since most of us weren't there we can never really know what happened to Marilyn for sure now can we. After reading this book I was satisfied in knowing that it was at least 100% believable, unlike some of the other Marilyn books that end up being 400+ pages of seemingly random gossip from friends of friends of Marilyn strung together to make a half-baked story. This is a great book and worth at least one read through."
5,What a nice surprise!,"My new girlfriend said she was ""allergic"" to latex so she told me to get some lamb skin condoms instead. I never bothered to look for them before so I set out to get a box or 2 but when I found them the sticker price was rather shocking! At Walgreens a box of 24 costs $41.99. I damn near chocked and then there were no ""Magnum"" size lamb skin versions. Double choke!!I picked up a pack of 3 for $14.15(that's about $4.71 each) and I tried one on. It's still a tight fit but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought and it didn't squeeze the life out of my penis. I will be buying alot more of these in the near future and I highly recommend them. To anyone with a little extra dough that is! :)"
5,Excellent product,"The answer for those with latex intolerance, comfortable, safe but with pleasant sensation and minimal reduction in feeling."
4,They worked just fine and had a nice ...,"They worked just fine and had a nice feel to them, but I'm not sure if they are worth the price. It seems a little expensive for what you get. They are fun to use and very enjoyable but they just didn't seem that much different from cheaper condoms."
3,There ok,there pretty good but the feel sort of weird need to get to used them and they're expensive but they work but there really strange i much rather use any other brand but if i have to i'd use this
2,"First time use, and pretty much last time as well","If u dont hav special requirement for condom, like allergy of latex.... i dont think this one is a good choice, first of all, the small of it is not that lovely, pretty much turned us down at the moment u open it. And worst part u have to hold it when u r ""out"" to take it out, if not u would hav the danger to get out the ""glory hole"" fully naked! Bought it just for curiosity, but pretty much not again!"
5,The best ever,"This is the best type of condoms. If you are in a commited relationship, shell out the money and enjoy!"
4,Natural Lamb Condoms aren't baaaaad,"Don't let the big condom manufacturers pull the wool over your eyes. Ewe'll be thrilled with the tender, gentle embrace of an all natural condom. Don't be sheepish about showing them to your partner. As long as STD's aren't a concern, you'll be well protected."
3,I'm rather indecisive about this product as it ...,"I'm rather indecisive about this product as it didn't seem to be any different than other similar products I've used. It was more difficult to put on and the lubricant was a bit on the greasy side. My wife helped Test Drive and she didn't care for it at all. Based on my experience, I don't think I'll be purchasing these in the future."
3,Word to the wise.,"My first sexual expierance was a disaster, I didnt know I was allergic to laytex! Since then, I have used Naturalamb condoms.I really feel that it is important to stress that these condoms DO NOT protect against STDs. More importantly I would like to know why! I love this product but with all the advances in medical study, Why cant they come up with something to protect Laytex sensitive users???So BE WARNED! these DO protect against pregnacy but, NOT against STDs."
2,Don't like these,They are coated with an awful feeling lubricant. Don't buy these. Durex Extra Sensitive are way better than these.
1,Terrible-Late & Expired,"Terrible. This product arrived a week late. When we went to look at them, they were way over expired. Talk about bad business. Won't make this mistake ever again."
1,They suck...,"I used one for the first and last time.... NEVER AGAIN! Sure, it felt natural and all, I was just scared/worried that it would break/fall off. And it did just that! We will find out in a month if it was defective!"
2,"No song menu, videos are butchered by voice over","Like another reviewer here, I was looking forward to seeing the ""Johnny and Mary"" video on this DVD as it rarely receives airtime. Imagine my disgust when the first part of the video has Robert Palmer giving voice over commentary, ruining the opening of the music video! Most of the other music videos have this same voice over commentary for the first 30 seconds.Another omission is a DVD menu to select each video clip, instead you have to navigate sequentially through the music videos + commentary."
1,Buyer Beware! REGION 1 Customer (USA & Canada) Beware,Can't really say much about this DVD since it will not play on either my new Sony Blu-ray player or my older DVD player because it's NOT a region 1 (NTSC) disc as listed. Unfortunately for me Amazon is not clear on this fact and I did not read the back cover until after opening it. Guess I'm now in the market for a PAL format DVD player if I want to watch this disc
3,"The Music is Great, But The DVD Features are Few","I owned this video on VHS, and replaced it with this DVD version, since VHS player technology is nearly gone. If you like Robert Palmer, the music is a good selection of his hits. Palmer himself gives a fairly lukewarm introduction to the videos. The DVD navigation features are nil. There are no chapter headings, so one needs to fast-forward through the DVD as if it were a VHS tape. The video quality is pretty rough, taken from a variety of sources, with a variety of quality from ""not so good"" to ""acceptable."" Nevertheless, it's great to see Robert Palmer, and to hear his music."
4,DVD Review,"Not sure what benefit my review will have, since Amazon has removed the title from the catalog. At least the title doesn't show up when a search on Robert Palmer is done in the DVD category. Some complained that Palmer's commentary was over the beginning of some clips. This wasn't too annoying."
2,Robert Palmer,I bought this video for one cut. The Addicted to Love song. Gotta love those French models in the background.
2,crappy rack,I bought it because it said it bolts up to a yj... well no. Its totally wrong.. ?Had to drill new holes.. cut rack mounts off.. weld new ones in with the CORRECT mounting pattern.. Very crappy!!!
3,It's a Light Bar. But it's a cheap one.,"When I installed this, I had enough problems as is with removing one of the nuts to install the bracket in the first place. Friend used a T-30 instead of a T-40 on the bolt and stripped it to a circle. Don't do that. Top one headache on top of another, the Bolt Extractor broke inside the bolt. Needless to say, headaches for all involved.But past that, the Light Bar does what it's supposed to, but don't expect it to be of the best construction for the price. The Mounting base for the Lights are uneven, one of the mounts were bent lower than the other during the welding process.I also personally don't agree with four bolts holding the lightbar in from the side only, and could easily see the bolts getting ripped right out along with the lightbar.Bottom line is, you get what you pay for."
4,Plain Old Good Music,"I got this CD after as a gift, after seeing the band live a few months before. I definately enjoyed the live show, but I wasn't blown away or anything by the band. The CD however, has definately been a pleasant surprise. The songwriting is superb. There are some of the greatest lyrics on this album. The band is able to express some of the same old themes of love, regret, loss, etc without sounding trite or like the same old same old. Instrumentally, this album is strong as well with a nice mix of more mellower tracks and some more powerful rock songs. Some tracks also include keyboards which adds a nice dimension to the mostly guitar powered rock. Overall, this album is well worth a listen and a purchase."
2,Didn't finish it,"I have been on a Jerome Jerome kick lately, reading everything. For some reason, I just couldn't get into this one and never finished it. I think it started of on a boring, random tangent and lost it."
2,Wow? Whoa!,"So far I am not impressed. Actually, I'm more confused than when I first ordered it. I was hoping that this book would guide me step by step through the cool effects it highlights, but it seems that you already have to know photoshop to understand this book. Admittedly, I haven't really poured over it...it immediately overwhelmed me. There's a CD included that complicates things even more. Not only do I have to figure out Photoshop...but the WOW things as well. Not what I expected at all."
1,The worst ever,"this is by far the wirst book I read ever, its hard to follow, not an easy read and its very confusing... save your mony and run away from it"
2,Messy,"This book reads as if it were written by John Nash from ""A Beautiful Mind"" on a bad day.Often disjointed and poorly organized. The writer seems to jot down random ideas as they come to him.It is full of nice pictures and comes with a work-along cd.There are interesting, useful lessons to be found here for the intermediate user but the structure is such that you will find yourself flipping quickly around the book instead of reading cover to cover."
2,Poorly written,"For those of you are looking for a helpful book on Photoshop that you can read from cover-to-cover, this is NOT the book for you.The book was very poorly written with no real structure to the lessons at hand. This book does a very poor job of explaining the techniques and tips it so eloquently portrays with all of the color images provided in the book.The book comes across as if it was written by a ""techie"" and is full of fragmented statements, half thoughts and harsh breaks between concepts. You may have to read certain sections a number of times before you can understand what the author is attempting to convey to the reader, and even then it may not make much sense.It should not be a battle to read an instructional book, but in this case, you may want to put on your armor."
3,visually beautiful but really for intermediate to advanced,"I admit to buying this book because of the glossy graphics but I got in way over my head. This book is a bit too advanced for someone just getting started with Photoshop.I have used some of the techniques and instructions offered but it has been tedious.I will not give up on this book, however, because after many readings and trial and error, I am making some progress. (...)The CD could include some better photos to work with but ""c'est la vie."""
4,Klimke explains the early training well,"This book does a great job of explaining and outlining the early training of the dressage horse, from ground training to work under saddle. I have used it as a reference for several articles I have written on dressage theory."
5,"If you only have one book on horses, this should be it.","Klimke writes in a simple, direct manner and he is absolutely correct in his instructions. Everyone who wants to be a good horseperson should read and study this book."
3,Basic Training?,"I thoguht this book was great because it is small and easy to carry to the barn. The pictures help you remember what you read in a ""jiffy"". Some of the information seems old and maybe a litle out of date but overall I think its a book thats good for anyone with a horse in training."
3,Basic Training of the Young Horse,"While Klimke lays the basic foundation of dressage training, he speaks from a perspective that is far removed from most American dressage lovers. Most don't have full time grooms and the ability to turn their horses out to pasture in the summer."
5,Works!,"Very easy to install. I love the LEDS.. the first time I hooked them up only one side of the LEDs worked, I looked closely at all of the LEDs on that side and noticed that one of them was shorting out, moved it slightly and it worked great! It is not a whole lot quieter, but it doesnt advertize itself that way either... (besides having ""whisper"" in its name..I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to replace a fan or mod your 360!"
5,Great Replacement Fan,"I purchased this fan to replace my broken Xbox 360's fan. Only one fan on the original unit spun, causing my console to overheat. It took 45 minutes to take apart my Xbox, install the fan, and put it back together. It's been in for a week and my Xbox has not come close to being hot and it hasn't shut off from overheating. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to replace the stock fan. By the way, it also is a lot quieter than the stock fan, and you can feel more hot air being blown out of the console.Definitely a good deal, don't hesitate if your Xbox fan is broken like mine was."
2,Not quieter,"I can't attest to whether they do a better job of cooling or not, but they certainly aren't quieter - not even a little. Very easy installation, though."
1,looks nice and it makes less noise because it moves less air i give this fan 1 out of 5 stars,looks nice and it makes less noise because it moves less air i give this item a 1 out of 5 as far as doing what they said it will do i give 0 out of 5
4,fan,"Don't fit quite right. little bigger than originals so had to bend frame little to get them in. then noticed one of the fans wasn't goin. took it apart and saw that when I bent the taps down a little to catch the lip on the fans, i did it just little too much and fan was binding on the housing. tweeked it a little and works good now. not really any louder than the original but move air way better. have smoked case and led's look awesome through there. all together, the function and appearance are great with these fans. put this next to xbox with factory fans to see difference and could really feel it from one to the other. so if you don't want the looks at least do it to prevent the damn red rings!"
5,amazing product,This product is great! Got it to cool my Xbox off more due to the fact that i added more things that got the Xbox hotter. It works perfectly and you can barely hear it. Also of course the blue LED light just add to the coolness. Hands down great product
5,Keeps my xbox cool!,"I bought this and it does cool my xbox down, the blue lighting is great as well. It does get loud though."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Ok so I wanted this fan because a customer requested it for his Xbox 360 that I enhanced with LED lights. Purchased this fan brand new and it is already dead, not only did the customer come back upset and furious about the product but now wants me to fix his RRoD on top of it!!HORRIBLE Yah great air flow...I suppose when the fan isn't blowing the air is free to come and go as it wants..."
5,Excellent replacement-- good way to prevent RROD,"I read some of the negative reviews before buying this fan and I had to say they made me a little apprehensive. The install couldn't have been easier, took me less than 10 min to get everything apart, install the fan, and put my case back together. If you're not familiar with how 360 cases come apart then that's a separate challenge. I give this product a 10/10. I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say the fan is loud... I can see why this is called the whisper. When putting my hand behind it there is significantly more air being moved than the stock fan. On top of that, the LED's aren't overbearing-- which is something else I worried about. I would really recommend this to anybody who is looking for a better fan to prevent RROD, it is very fairly priced and a good way to give your case some style!"
3,Nice and quiet,"This isn't the kit with the nitro switch, however still a nice quiet fan and I have noticed an approx 5-10% increase in airflow (cooler xbox :)), a straight forward install which was quite simple and quick and the blue led's look cool....received what I ordered"
1,Avoid these fans,"Installed the Talismoon fans in a Jasper unit. They do not quite fit properly and the blades can hit the air shroud when it is screwed down tightly.Talismoon claims that these fans push more air, but measurement via internal sensors revealed that the actual cooling performance is extremely poor. Idle temps immediately rose +15C above the stock fans and kept climbing, despite the auto fan speed raising them to a very noisy level.Avoid these fans. If you're hoping to replace buzzing/whining fans, I recommend OEM Nidec fans (all black, no text) if you can find them."
5,Works as intended,"Bought this along with some ram heatsinks in hopes that it would help deter the system from getting the RROD. First, I love the blue leds. Its a real nice touch. Second, I can definitely feel it blowing out more hot air, which is obviously what you want. Third, it sounds a lot more quieter. The noise you mostly hear comes from the DVD drive with the disc in. If you install it onto your H.D. you hear almost nothing. Overall I'm very pleased with the fan and hope it continues to help give the system a longer life."
2,:(:(:(:(:(:(:(,the fans are cool but they are not working properly and its overheating and now only 1 fan works i didn't do anything to it it just stoped working so i had to put the standered fans in :(
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"Terrible FAN, it does NOT even fit. Don't spend $20 on this piece of ****!!! Please again, DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Crap,This was a stock fan. This was total crap. Don't buy from this seller. They did not ship me a Talismoon Whisper Fan. It was a black stock fan. It was not what I ordered.
1,complete crap!,"Avoid this product at all costs! I bought this for my 360 last year and had nothing but problems. first off Talismoon clams that they go faster then the original 360 fans, they do not. it seems to me that the LED draw more power and make the fans go much much slower. also they don't fit well at all. one of the motors even got as bad as to start locking up. complete garbage. never ever but this!"
5,No problem,I have had this in my Xbox 360 for a long time And have applied numerous hours and it has yet to fail. With my falcon motherboard it runs very quiet.
4,Seems to cool better,"I purchased this fan because my Xbox 360 suffered the E74 error, which left it useless. I decided to attempt the repair myself rather than send the console to Microsoft because my warranty has long been expired. After applying heat to certain components and then installing this fan, it's been working without any problems. Time will tell if it will work as a permanent fix.I gave the fan 4 stars because it does seem to be cooling the Xbox well, but I don't see it as being any quieter than the original fan. It actually gets pretty loud at times, but not the the point of being a problem.NOTE: You will have to open your Xbox 360 to install this fan. If it is still under warranty, this will void it."
5,Xbox 360 classic style Must Have,"If you have an older Xbox 360 and the warranty is up, this is worth it. Its better that the Xbox 360 over heating out of warranty. It is not as quite as I expected, how ever it it is quitter that the stock fan and dose more more air. It saved my Xbox 360 from over heating the other day. The power supply over heated instead and that only needs to cool down to start working again. Any way the Fan works great and is worth the money."
1,Black not Grey. So annoyed!,"This is not ""Painted to match factory dash color"" its black and does not match the dark grey. So annoying that they lie. What a waste of $13"
4,"Motorcycles, aliens and dinosaurs...","Way to go, Peter Laird and Jim Lawson! This book has some of the greatest elements in science fiction graphical novels. Good solid art, a relevant style, and exciting storyline. Reminiscent of Star Wars with its own techno-slang, gritty talk, and colorful characters. It made this reader think they were observing a real life alternate world."
2,Ouch,"Maybe I am just ultra-sensitive, but these ""Ultra Ribbed"" condoms rubbed me raw and actually made sex more painful. No thanks."
5,Great,Just what I wanted. Bought a bunch and made longer and double bridges. Detail is very good. Scale is right on.
2,okay...?,"I had a very difficult time getting into this book. The language used to show the mental thought of the 14 year old was exhausting to read, and it was hard to follow at times.The only reason I gave this book two stars was due to the last couple or three chapters. It really started to come together and resemble some type of a story, not just random thoughts from a kids head.If not for the last few chapters, I wouldn't give this book any stars at all."
5,Inspired Beauty,"Another elegant presentation in the Sacred Treasures series. In Sacred Treasures III, Ellen Holmes has artfully combined some of the best recordings of Russian choral music from the orthodox liturgy (many by Rachmaninov) with uniquely beautiful arrangements such as Gunnar Eriksson's arrangement of Bach's ""Komm Susser Tod"" and less familiar pieces like the wordless ""Chorale"" by Georgian composer Josif Kechakmadze, which I found to be engaging. The inspired beauty of this music reaches into the soul and instills a sense of peace, as only music can."
3,Disappointing Sound Quality,"I purchased this because I was very excited to see the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir singing ""Allelulia, Behold the Bridegroom"" (one of my favorite pieces), but overall I am unimpressed with this CD (actually-- I can only speak of the MP3 download from Amazon).The music is all outstanding, and incredibly performed, but several of the tracks have very disappointing sound quality with distracting static and clicks. I'm by no means one of those picky ""audiophiles"" that like to nag. It really is detrimental to the music."
3,Informative,I found this book quit informative. If your a beginner in the industry I recommend this for a good read.
1,Book needs work!,"This book tries to covers the whole spectrum of low voltage and tries to cover a lot of technical details, but does not fully explain or communicate efficiently to the student what these terms mean and how they are used in low voltage wiring. The review questions asked of the student are ridicules in that the student is basically asked to write a book from a book, with extremely long chapter reviews in which lengthy answers are required in a book that does not give up its answers easily! It would also be nice if the book had chapter summaries to reinforce what the student has read. This is obviously a first edition book with new authors that will hopefully improve in future editions. I would recommend this book only for someone with a good basic background in low voltage systems."
4,"Provocative, eccentric, gender-bender photography","Charles Gustina presents his audience with provocative and totally idiosyncratic gender-bender portraits. The eccentricity of the photographs is heightened by the recurring religious motifs: some quite obvious, others very subtle. The autobiographical introduction provides some of the background clues for this unusual view of the world, but the full story remains elusive, perhaps even for the photographer himself. The homoerotic element in the photographs is often completely muted by the mysterious, but often playful, atmosphere so tantalizingly conveyed by Mr. Gustina. It won't be everyone's choice as a coffee table book, but those who take a chance will be rewarded."
3,Pretty awful but loads of fun,"Like a million other B westerns, but the real highlight is the inclusion of Louise Massey and the Westerners who get a real chance to swing at the big barndance scene!"
2,disappointing,"Somewhat disappointing, after reading all the rave reviews on this one. Spending close to six hours watching this, made me wanting to know more about the prosecutors' point of view. It also left me a bit in the blue as to whether this guy really is innocent or not. For a documentary presented as being so close to the drama, after all it wasn't that close, really. After the third episode it all becomes very repetitive. But I guess, that's the justice system for you ; )"
2,"Superbly made, but terribly flawed","Like many others who have written their reviews, I found this a compelling and addictive documentary. However, I would urge everyone to please dig deeper and look into the mountain of evidence that was used to convict Peterson - most of which was left on the cutting room floor and was deliberately left out of this documentary.You have to ask yourself why the film maker, Lestrade, would deliberately try to manipulate the audience into believing that the American justice system put an innocent man in jail for a murder he didn't commit. Instead, the American justice system got it right and poor Kathleen Peterson can rest in peace while her sociopathic husband serves a life sentence for her murder. This documentary failed to show the real reasons why the jury convicted Peterson and that makes this a documentary that is more fiction than fact."
5,Loved the Adventure,"As a child growing up on a farm and woodland, I was facsinated with the idea of living in that wilderness. Many days I climbed into the crotch of a tree in the woods, watched the small woodland creatures and dreamed of living there forever, fetching water, firewood and sleeping under the canopy of vines and stars. It is exciting to see a writer living that dream and how well that wilderness setting inspires her work as well as her soul. As a now fifty-something woman, she makes me feel anything is possible, even in these cynical times. Good on you, Anne!"
2,Disappointing after the first book,"I was disappointed in this second book and enjoyed the first one (Woodswoman) much more. I had a hard time connecting emotionally with this book and did not feel the same sense of adventure as with the 1st book. I would definitely recommend Woodswoman, but you can skip this book."
2,What a disappointment,"I read and enjoyed Woodswoman, and I purchased this book because I was curious to see how things progressed for Ms. LaBastille. This book was not nearly as fun to read, or as interesting as the first."
2,A Disappointment,"If you are a bit paronoid and want to think that at least you are safer in the city than in the country, perhaps you will enjoy this book. Ms. LaBastille nearly blows away a fan who comes to visit with one of the several loaded guns she keeps around the house. I was hoping to find a book by somone who had integrated herself with nature. Unfortunately with her dogs and guns, she seemed to be mostly fighting her edge of wilderness surroundings."
2,Slow,Found this really hard to get into. The author jumps all over the place with memories. She doesn't flower up scenes too much but I just can't get into it. The narrator is excellent she deserves 5 stars brilliant but a very below average story. sorry. won't even bother to try any more of this authors.
5,Easy summer reading,This is a heartwarming collection of encounters - you can read one short chapter for a daily pick me up or read from start to finish in a short afternoon. A great reminder of where the spirit lives and uplifting personal reflection.
1,It's NOT REAL Hungarian Paprika,"If you look at the paprika, it's not REAL Hungarian. Thus, this is why it says Hungarian ""style."" Don't be fooled by sellers who sell you Spanish or Chinese paprika under the umbrella of ""Hungarian Paprika."" Also, they can't even spell ""Kalocsai"" right on the can! So much for their 'Hungarian style' of FAKE Hungarian paprika. I highly suggest to pass on this item!"
1,Completely missleading!!,The item they show is not the one they send. I got the old ultrathin ones which are not even that thin...if I knew i getting that i wouldnt had bought it in the first place b/c i dont like those. I wanted the ones in the description but I guess they are fine with lying to you.
5,Shaw-nuff excells,"A fun and impromptu session with Woody and his friends. Woody left us with perfection, class and wonderfulness. Woody's playing goes straight to the heart, where it belongs. you can't go wrong with this gig. you""ll have as much fun as they did in this meeting."
4,good value,Shocks work well and are durable. Installed 2nd set at 200K miles. They are stiff for a while until they break in. Check and see if you need rubber bumper and plastic booty as they are not included.
2,how does who type uuugghghh,"I was hopingn to read about risk management and insurance for my personal studies after passing the Actuary Exam P. This is the type of book that students dread in the university. WAY to much trivial information, little analysis, overly simplified perspectives, and again, way too much information. The kind of details that won't do you any good on the job until you relearn them through the way that any individual corporation works with them. The kind of book a student must pointlessly memorize before forgetting it after the test. It is the worst example of a TEXTBOOK."
4,"The original ""Magic Mike""","Why isn't this on DVD? From what I remember, it's very similar in story to ""Magic Mike,"" and I'd rather watch Gregory Harrison than Channing Tatum any day. C'mon! Re-release this!"
5,Magnificent,Ignore the nitpicking about the DVD. Three live performances of major sonatas from a giant of the piano in good sound for almost nothing. Don't miss it.
3,live ConstruKction much better than studio ConstruKction,"Nearly all of this music (only the extra track from ProjeKct X is missing) is available on the live album, Heavy ConstruKction. The live versions are far superior.The instrumental selections on this album are good, but the live versions are more energetic and aggressive (although this version of FraCktured is nearly as good, in its own way). Even more important, is that the studio versions really are garbaged up with tons of production gimmicks that are stripped away on the live versions. Many of the vocals on this album are just plain annoying and distracting due to the studio trickery.I'm quite the KC nut these days, so I'll hang on to this, if only for the extra track by ProjeKct X. But if forced to choose, I'd stick with Heavy ConstruKction, no question."
3,Part heavy instrumental greatness ... part popl vocal weakness,"Since the Fripp/Belew/Bruford/Levin quartet released ""Discipline,"" King Crimson has been simultaneously very difficult to listen to ... or to stay away from. Tight, powerfully progessive instrumental prowess?: check. Insipid, meaningless, mediocre pop-oriented singing?: unfortunately, check also. This release is just more of the same.Check out the various Projekts for brilliant instrumental improvisation as only this quartet (trio, double trio, whatever) can pound out. Or, belive it or not, Adrian Belew's edgy ""e"" trio release -- in which he lets his guitar do all of the talking. And check out the all instrumental improv ""THRaKaTTaK"" if you are muscially brave enough. But in order to get through this album, you'll have to program the sing-songy novelty lyric dreck to the cuting room floor."
3,Nothing LIGHT on this thing!,"Made in USA in 2000, Serial#8-49261-2, Playing Time: 58 min.I first got hooked on KC with their album ""RED"". They've obviously evolved a lot since then, both musically and lyrically. This CD features Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto and is a little bit heavier than usual. The compositions are fairly structured, not quite as loose as some of their live performances. There are no soft (or light) moments on the album, and they often demonstrate their musicianship. Tracks like ""FraKctured"" and ""Larks' Tongues In Aspic IV"" are reminiscent of their ancestors, but with completely new sounds textures.The down side to this album are the vocals: they are distracting, not to say annoying because of their flat delivery.The album may grow on you, but you'll be tempted to skip over a couple of tracks simply because of some of the poor vocals."
2,RecyCKled,"A HUGE disappointment. One would almost mistake this for a KC tribute album, were it not for the obviously stellar technical level of musicianship. THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE. Lifeless retread. Bluster substituted for drama. Well, not quite. ProzaKc Blues manages to combine the ""strengths"" of the two (arguably) worst Crimson tracks of all time: ""Ladies of the Road"" and ""Peoria"". Give me ""Starless"", or ""Three of a Perfect Pair"", or any of the Soundscapes, or Belew's masterpiece ""Twang Bar King"", or indeed almost anything (except the equally soulless Thrak and its variants)."
2,I can't think of a worse King Crimson recording,"Hey, I've loved this band for years, but I'm at a loss to explain the mess they've committed to disc this time. It's the musical hot potato of the season - I know people who can't give this thing away.A real dissapointment from a band that's done so much better."
2,"MISSING THRAK, TONY AND BILL","It's not a ""bad"" album, that's why I give it 2 stars, but thrak is far much better for several reasons: 1)the songs. 2)the sound (why they did'n record the album in the real world studios,like thrak?, you can cleary see the difference). 3)the lyrics. 4)bill and tony. 5)the fresh ideas. Because is KC, you can only expect high quality stuff. This record is only a parody of their own. Nothing really new. Skip this one."
3,"no risks, no glory","Interesting music even for die hards like me. But there'slittle risk reminiscent of old days when you could count on somethingunique from the KC camp every now and then such as League of Gentlemen, Discipline, Larks Tongue, the first time you heard Frippertronics......Still good, not great, and rarely memorable.However, Fripp's playing is great throughout. Actually, I like all of the guitar playing on this disc. But I can't help to wonder how much better this record would have sounded with Bruford on it..."
1,Frank Zappa did it better 30 years ago.,"This CD is comprised of mostly not-so-interesting, non-melodic ""experimental"" pieces. This is hardly the evolution you'd expect from a progressive rock band as this style of music was done better by Zappa many years ago. Crimson needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with some original ideas of their own. This is only exceeded in its dullness by Level Five."
4,Is there any way to delete Track 1?,"A new KC album is not so much a ""release"" as a ""happening""... TCoL is sure to please fans of THRAK and the ProjeKts. Larks IV and the title track are both brilliant cuts, and are sure to be enjoyed over and over again as new nuances are discovered with each listen. The only problem I have with this disc is the ABYSMAL opening track ""ProzaKc Blues"" - what the heck were they thinking? However, aside from this apparent momentary lapse of reason, TLoC is another winner from a band that is truly far ahead of its time. It's a shame these guys can't stop aging..."
3,another rehash,"This is not a bad record as compared to others in a similar genre being currently produced. But as a King Crimson record, it is not up to the level of artistry expected.Oh sure, there is lots of thunder and some lightning. Drama, comedy. But there is an overriding theme to this record that I find sad - the past. Reworks of Lark's Tongues and Fractured (the original tracks having an inventiveness and power that KC has not achieved since 1981's Discipline) are not bad, but why are they here? More interlocking guitar? Surely there are more interesting things two premier guitarists can do.A long time KC fan, mega-fan for that matter, I bought this record based on reviews here. I just don't get it, this record isn't even in the ballpark of the earlier KC's work. Somehow, I don't KC ever will again."
1,The ConstruKction of Krap,"Having been a King Crimson fan for a long, long time I was really disapponted in this disc. This is, without a doubt, the band's worst release. I was not worried about the fact that neither Bill or Tony appear on this release. However, there is not one minute of this that is salvagable. Everybody is entitled to a miss once in awhile I guess this is King Crimson's. They are a REALLY GREAT band so buy any of their other releases. The least annoying track on here is I Have A Dream but I think that it might have something to do with the fact that it's near the end of the disc. Larks Tongues in Aspic should never have been used as a title on here as it might give a bad impression of som of their older discs Larks, Tongues in Aspic and Three Of A Perfect Pair."
4,"It took me back to the ""good ole' days""","Being mostly familiar with their work from In The Court Of The Crimson King through Three Of A Perfect Pair I bought this disc because of the continuation of ""Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Pt. 4"".To be fair I didn't skip ahead but started at the beginning and from the opening notes of ""ProzaKc Blues"" I was blasted back to Discipline and Three Of A Perfect Pair.The lyrics can get odd and Adrian Belew's singing may not be his best but the arrangement and production, well, it's Crimson."
3,Fracktured,"Well.....I cannot believe some of the reviews I have read about this disc.In particular the insults to the Mastelotto/Gunn rythm section who take this music to places no-one else could have taken it. I like this KC disc a lot( for all it's faults), on first hearing I thought it was just ok, especially as it arrived hot on the heels of the amazing Projeckts box set, but have begun to unearth the magic.I now a lot of people feel this is very much a transitional album but in my view it could easily have been edited down to produce a much more cohesive (and much better) disc...."
2,Yngwiei Fripp,"This record misses Bill Bruford so badly I almost can't stand it. Pat Mastelotto at best sounds like he's wandering drunk through a junk yard and they looped the resulting sound. I keep wondering how much more I would have liked it otherwise. Hey, I'd rather hear a version with no drums!The only good thing (which is not a small thing I will admit) is that the guitar playing of Fripp and Belew is amazing on this disc. So it gets some stars for that effort at least.I've been a KC fan for years and have heard nearly every record. Fripp might own the name but he hasn't been the sole center of gravity of King Crimson in a very long time."
2,Where's the magic?,"We all love this group of musicmakers.However, before you buy this King Crimson CD do your homework and review which ""members"" took part in making Construcktion of Light..."
5,A latter day masterpiece,"This is Crimson's finest effort since reforming in '94, and stands up well in comparison to 'Discipline', 'Larks', and 'Red'. The sound is a little cleaner with the band down to four members. While this is not easily accessible music, great rewards will be yielded for those who give this CD a couple of listens. (Of course, the same could be said of all of Crimson's work!)"
4,"my least favorite crimson cd, but still good","this is the only King Crimson cd that I dont absolutely love.that doesnt mean its not good, because it is, its just not amazingly great like all their other stuff.There are still good songs and plenty of them, but over all the album is poor for Crimson standardsmy favorite song is the opener ProzaKc Blues its amusing and funsecond favorite on the cd is Lark's Toungues in Aspic pt. 4and the bonus track from ProjeKct X was extremely enjoyableit raised my rating from a 3 to a 4"
4,"Falls short of perfect, but a good offering from King Crimson","I've listened to this album several times now, and have developed some opinions. While I'm a King Crimson fan, I'd say that I cannot give this a perfect score. The instrumentals on this album are excellent (the first part of ConstruKction of Light, FraKctured, Lark's Tongues) and really hold the album up. Prozac Blues is a humorous song, dealing with depression. Belew's vocals are run through some kind of filtering to make him sound like a drunk psychopath, or something. Anyways, other songs like The World's My Oyster Soup Kitchen Floor Wax Musuem, seem to have no merit, and are wierd just for the sake of wierd. The album does end on a strong note with Heaven and Earth, a song apparently done by the Project X group. All in all, a good offering from King Crimson, and a must for all Crimheads."
3,"Good movies, no English subtitles","Quality movie for the time period and price. Kids love it. My only complaint was that the subtitles available are only french and spanish. We have one that is hard of hearing, so we often rely of captions."
3,Many minor flaws,"I was looking forward to getting this figure when it first came out. I didn't know much about Hasbro's ""need"" to reuse old sculpts. I had highly articulated figures like Obi-Wan in pilot gear and... The super-articulated clone trooper. This was my first ""old-style"" figure, it has the articulation points of an old pathetic Power of the Force figure, (I didn't like POTF much at all) only with a head that moves up and down and swivels to the sides at a point.I have already explained the articulation, but this figure's accesories are an imperial blaster, removable backpack, and as usual a stand and a hologram. That's okay, but it doesn't make up for it's terrible articulation. They REALLY need to make a super-articulated version of this figure... But I say that about alot of figures. But I wish an SA Snowtrooper would be on Hasbro's high priority list."
4,My wife and I enjoyed the pleasure of ...,"My wife and I enjoyed the pleasure of using this particular condom, however we can't say that it has much more sensitivity compared to other types of condoms. I'd continue to use them, but I wouldn't pay any extra for the """"shared sensation"""" feature."
4,I was satisfied with this product. The lubrication ...,I was satisfied with this product. The lubrication was sufficient and it wasn't bulky. No tears or leaks. I'd purchase it again.
4,One of the buttons was broken.,"This is a great hat. It keeps me warm, along with making my friends jealous. One of the buttons was broken off, or rather not there. But its still a great and fuzzy hat! (If you have a big head, not ideal)"
5,Great product,I bought 2 of these and they use a standard size bulb. I use cfl in mine. you cant see very well in the picture but there is a push switch to turn it off and on located on the black part. the cord is really long too. I would definitely buy this again if I needed one.
5,Debra Susie was one of the editors too...,"Dr. Debra Anne Susie was another editor for The Black Abolitionist Papers.Her Ph.D. in the Humanities at the Florida State University was later published by the same title by the University of Georgia Press (1988): ""In the Way of Our Grandmothers: A Cultural View of Twentieth-Century Midwifery in Florida"" (244 pages). Her book is also available at amazon.com!"
3,"Lyrical yes, but does not provide much informatiom","I found the book interesting and written in a beautiful prose.vInspiring by its beautiful craftmanship of writing, but not impressed on the facts or new information that I was hoping to get. At some point in the middle of the book I started skipping paragraphs because Of the pattern of repetition. It reads like a long mantra inspiring us to become better, attuned to higher vibrations. It highlights the poor level of spirituality in our societies and known ways to raise awareness, nothing new, nothing new. I suppose the repetitiousness is on purpose, to elucidate a state of awareness to finer states of mind.If you have read many books on spiritual matters coming from ""above"" (guides or ETs) this book is just another one of them and need not be read. I was planning to read the whole saga, but decided the rest would be the same repetitious theme. Iff you like beautiful prose, on a known theme, go ahead and read it. Otherwise, don 't."
5,Quality saxophone,Purchased this for my son. This is a quality saxophone. I would recommend this item. Company even called to let me know the item had been shipped. Shipped fast and packaged well. Would purchase from this company again.
2,phrases need to be broken down,"For the complete beginner there are too many phrases that need to be broken down. I bought this audio tape in order to listen to and learn basic expressions in my car. There is little vocabulary offered, it is almost entirely phrases making it too difficult for the beginner to follow. Nothing is ever repeated. For instance, 1-5 numbers are spoken once, soon followed by a long phrase about what to do at 8:30. The accompanying book is good, and i'm sure a traveler who wants to point at pages will be satisfied. I returned it."
1,do NOT buy.... poorly thought out,"THE CD SUCKS:1. They only repeat things ONCE (ergo, too FAST)2. When they teach you the numbers they teach you numbers 1-5 in one track and numbers 6-19 in another track then the rest of the numbers later. WHY?!3. There's isn't a separate introduction track, so I have to skip the first TWO minutes of Track 1 to actually get to the Czech which means I can't just play it on loop.THE BOOK IS OK:1. The pages are color-coded so if you need to find phrases concerning eating at a restaurant, you can find it right away.2. There is a section of phrases for native speakers to point to in case you can't understand them.Anyway, I'm really sorry I bought this since I can't return it. It's one of the worst learning CDs I've bought. This makes learning Czech REALLY hard. It's a poorly thought out series."
2,Not for the beginner,"This CD is not for anyone who hasn't had previous experience with Czech. I find Czech rather challenging to pronounce, which is why I ordered a CD, but this one is not at all helpful. It gives very few basic words then takes off into long phrases that are impossible to repeat in the time given. Nothing is repeated. The speaker speaks quickly, which might be natural, but does nothing to help the student pick out individual words. Since I opened it I can't return it, but I'd like to. So, buyer of CDs beware. Once they're opened, you're stuck with them."
1,Not the latest edition,"I ordered this book for my son's high school class. It was expensive, especially for a paperback. It was listed as new. When my son brought it to school, he discovered it was the old edition (over 10 yrs. old) and he wouldn't be allowed to use it for school."
4,Good for the price.,"I ordered this grill cover after my wife bought me a new grill for Father's Day. The first cover came with a large slit through the packaging right into the cover! I was upset but when I contacted the company to replace it they over-nighted a replacement and a return shipping label. The customer service blew me away. The new cover arrived and is exactly what I expected. This is not a heavy duty canvas cover, but is more than enough to protect your grill for a couple seasons. After a few months it is still in great shape and has not faded at all. The velcro straps at the bottom are a great way to custom size the cover to your grill. If you don't want to spend 50 bucks on a Cubs grill cover, then this is the way to go! Happy with my purchase. Go Cubbies!!"
2,Okay looking but already ripped!,"I gave this to my husband on Father's Day. Two weeks later, it's ripped. We didn't even use the grill in that time; that's just from being outside. Hopefully I'll be able to return this. The Cubs logo is great, but the quality is lacking."
5,Excellent!!,The watch is exactly what I expected for. It is beautiful and modern. Nike did a great job with this peace.
4,Perfect Book for Thoughts,"I got this book and I thought it was perfect for what I wanted. It's ver sleek and masculine, subtle but dramatic. It's got a magnetic front flap and includes a satin red ribbon book mark. Inside the flap, and I'm assuming this is with each different editions of this book, it has the word Peace written in 15 different languages. I thought that was a very nice and interesting touch. The only think I Didn't like about the book was that it has the kind of finish that kind of holds prints and smudges a bit. But other than that it is a great buy and fits comfortably in a purse! So you gotta love that!"
5,GREAT C.D.!!! THESE GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!,"I've been playing this c.d. since I got it. Their last c.d., Songs About Jane was good, this is far better.Most music coming out today is crap, but these guys are certainly talented. This c.d. will have a permanent place on my iPod."
5,If I could only give more stars!!!,"I was so surprised at how much I loved this album right away. I have not been a huge fan in the past, but this album has changed that. My co-worker and I discovered it one night at work, and after that we were hooked.Of course, ""Makes Me Wonder"" is a great song, but the rest of the album does not let you down. My favorites include ""If I Ever See Your Face Again"", ""Little of Your Time"", ""Wake Up Call"", ""Can't Stop"", and ""Kiwi"". Awesome lyrics, terrific beats - definitely a great addition to my library."
5,"Great sophomore album, a must have","I also own ""Songs about Jane"" and enjoyed it very much (loved some songs). But I must say I completely love this new CD, which is really unusual for a band on their sophomore release.It has nice ballads, smoking hot rock and pop songs with obvious fusion of greatness from the early to mid- eighties pop. I am surely dating myself here and maybe because it reminds me of that retro-music with wonderful currentness that I love it soo much. A definite must buy."
2,Disappointing follow-up album,"Maroon 5 has gone soft. There is no ""meat"" to this album. Songs About Jane was so strong, and therefore as a follow-up this album is quite disappointing."
4,It's what pop music should aspire to be.,"I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, and what most would consider to be ""Pop"" isn't exactly on the top of my list. This album is an exception. With funky grooves, soulful synths, and catchy lyrics, there aren't a lot of bad spots in this album. I'm a sucker for bonus material, so i snagged the deluxe edition at Wal-Mart, and wasn't disappointed with the concert footage included. Good stuff."
4,Sounds Like a New Version of Jackson 5,"I don't follow this band, but I was listening to the newest cd and alot of the tracks sound like a newer version of a cd put out by Jackson 5. Like a 2000 version of the Victory cd. Especially the tracks - Make Me Wonder and Kiwi. Most all of those songs have the a bit of that sound. Well, maybe they did pull from the past. Jackson 5 -- Now Maroon 5. Sounds good though."
5,Maroon 5 is Going Places!,Loved this follow up album I bought SAJ after really liking a majority of the songs. Their follow up has really impressed me and I really feel this band is going places! I highly recommend this album and feel you will not be disappointed it will be money well spent!
5,Another Awesome CD,"I walk to this CD daily, I am just playing the heck out of it, just like I did with SAJ. The only thing is Adam can push the envelope with the lyrics/songs and you got to watch the kiddies. My favorites: 'I'm not falling apart"" and ""Nothing lasts forever"". ""Kiwi"" is nasty, and I'm no prude ;)"
3,A Step Down from SAJ,"It Won't Be Soon seems to me to be an over-produced album with little of the original flair that attracted so many of us to Maroon 5. It is percussion driven, and many songs would do well to be included on the latest Justin Timberlake album. As a long time Maroon 5 and Kara's Flowers fan, I was disappointed by this latest work. Not Falling Apart does not compare to the band's first song by that name, and the single Makes Me Wonder is so far from the band's past work that it was only recognizable to me because of Adam's unmistakable vocals. However, though the album has definite flaws it is still entertaining, and I don't regret purchasing it. Let's just hope Maroon 5 gets back on track the next time around."
5,Exactly what it says on the tin,Great album! Digital is the way to go; having it stored in the cloud and easily accessible is a plus.
3,Pretty Good,I recieved the CD in a timely manner. The case was damaged with tape all over it but the CDs themselves play fine.
3,Does not rock,"How did a rock/soul band with an edge transform into a cheesy 80s dance boy-band? Some songs resemble SAJ very closely, except they are more nasal, and more corny. Bring the ROCK back, Maroon 5!!!"
3,bit disappointing,"i didn`t really like the first single, which promoted this album, but i thought the rest won`t be so bad. well, i was wrong. theirs first album is great, i was listening to it over and over. this one is mostly in a style of a this first single. and it`s some funky pop or something i can`t even describe. i liked two or three songs in general, which were more in theirs old style. this one is only ok as a background music... pity."
3,Disapointed,"I have long awaited the new Maroon 5 albumn with much anticipation. I LOVE ""Songs About Jane"" It is still my favorite albumn. This one will not be replacing it. It just doesn't have the heart and soul that ""Songs About Jane"" did. They have lost their unique sound, and that is why I liked them to start with. This albumn seems like they sold out to become just another boy band. Don't get me wrong, it's okay, i'll listen to it, it's just not anywhere near as good as ""Songs About Jane."""
3,Maroon 5 disappointment,"Having heard Maroon 5's best songs on the radio, I was disappointed in this album. It would have been better to just download the most popular songs from iTunes. I was hoping that the work would all be as good as the most popular songs."
4,My First Maroon 5 Experience,"This is my first Maroon 5 cd It Won't Be Soon Before Long. I watch the video for ""Wake Up Call"" and thought, ""man I've got to get that cd."" I have not been disappointed. This groups got ""it,"" whatever ""it"" is they've got it. I love the voice of Adam Levine, it is so unique. This cd reminds of the being in the 80's dance clubs getting my groove on. Loved this CD."
5,Pleasantly surprised,I was pleasantly surprised that Maroon 5 could follow up Songs For Jane with such an excellent cd. My wife and I loved every song on the playlist and we couldn't wait to add it to our Ipods. This was money well spent and I can't wait for their next cd. If you love Maroon 5 you have to have this cd.
4,awesome,"this album really grew on me, but not as wacky and good as the first one. i still love maroon 5 though!"
5,heartbreaker,"Love the CD. As always Adam Levine writes about relationships gone bad...in varying degrees. Normally, that would be depressing (at least for me) but the lyrics are so well written and set so well, you can't dance along to his pain."
5,Enjoyable....,This is my first time listen to a Maroon 5 cd. I really like it. The songs seem short but its still has alot of good tunes. Highly recommended.
4,Loved it,"If you liked ""Songs about Jane"" you will probably like this one as well. ""It Won't Be Soon Before Long"" is great in its own right but the sound is slightly more pop then the songs on ""Songs about Jane"". The lyrics are a little weak on some of the songs however the music still sounds great as they are still a tight sounding band. It has an 80's sound to it without sounding too corny. I think its worth the money."
2,Maroon 5,"I was disappointed in this CD. I LOVE Songs about Jane, but this is completely different. Just buy one of the songs if you like it, but don't waste your money on the whole CD!"
4,Terrific folloow-up CD,"This new CD hasn't come out of my car cd player since it arrived last week. It is pop rock at its finest -- while it doesn't live up to Maroon 5's first album, almost every cut on it is entertaining and catchy -- it's a joy to watch this band develop and grow. This album mixes hip hop, pop rock, a little jazz, a little alt rock to create it's own style. Most of the songs on this album have that ""you done me wrong but I love you anyway"" theme to them, so you have to wonder what's going on with Adam Levine and Co in the love department...but it doesn't matter, I'm singing along with every cut."
2,Mediocre sophomore album,"First single ""Makes Me Wonder"" is the best song on the album. ""Wake up Call"" and ""Can't Stop"" come in a close second with the first one likely to be the next single. ""Won't Go Home Without You"" is there response to ""She Will Be Loved."" The album isn't quite as clever lyrically, melodically or musically as the first album. There's no single near as catchy as anything on the first album. Overall, an okay sophomore attempt that keeps Maroon 5 in the mainstream and gives them one more chance to put out something really great for the next album. That's my two cents."
1,where is it,"I have not received this album. I am waiting for it to show up on the cloud player so i can enjoy the music. It normally is a quick process, what is wrong. It shows that I have already purchased it, and my credit card has posted the transaction, but there is nothing in my cloud player."
2,....,"I loved their first single so I decided to pick up the cd. Most of the songs are meaningless to me and the lyrics are bordering immature. The music is catchy, but if you listen to the lyrics you will cringe. Very disapointed with this cd! If you are on the fence about purchasing this, please do yourself a favor and look up the lyrics first."
1,A Great Band of... Retro Disco,"Maroon 5 it's a Pop Band (or a Retro Disco Band) with a rock face: Long hair and a rocker possé, but this image is quite suspicious.This band was created for companies like MTV or VH1 or PEPSI? Of CourseWhich is the difference between Britney Spears and Maroon 5? Doubtlessly nonePlease don't buy this CD!"
2,Another one bites the dust...,"Maroon 5 becomes the music industry's newest victim...take a solid, talented band, and produce a piece of musical garbage that you can market."
1,Not worth the wait,"I loved their first album, Songs About Jane, and couldn't wait until they put out another album. I was so disappointed, and wished I'd listened to the samples first before purchasing it. The first album was very passionate, unique, and soulful. In this one, it's obvious they've sold out and are now writing songs to the demographics their producers and agents have told them to write for - 13-18 yr. old girls. Hopefully they will find themselves again in the future and put out music that's an expression of themselves, not what will them make a quick buck and spot on MTV."
1,Not a Good Album,"Nearly all the ballads are schmaltzy, slow and repetitive. I really liked Songs About Jane but this album is really bad."
3,Waiting for their third CD . . .,It's great to hear artists evolve but I'm not sure that Maroon 5 has moved forward with their second effort. It's not fair to want Songs About Jane 2 but the band moved away from rock and into the world of pop where instruments are secondary to the mixing board. I saw them in concert and I was blown away by their talent. It was also obvious that their audience is young girls. This CD plays to the same audience that thinks Paris Hilton is interesting news. If that's you buy this CD. However I can't help but noticed that the talent that was displayed on the road is lost in the overproduction of a studio session.They are too good a band for this to be a bad CD and maybe it will grow on me but I doubt it and overall I'm disappointed. I thought Maroon 5 had the potential to be something special. I guess I'm going to wait for their third CD with crossed fingers that it will be more interesting than It Won't Be Soon Before Long.
1,Terrible and completely BORING.... zzzz zzzz zzzz !!!!!!!!,"I would give it a NEGATIVE 5 Stars if I could. Terrible and makes me want to take a nap. What is up with this album??? They are trying way to hard and it doesn't work. This album is Trite at best. This album shouldn't have been made. I mean come on guys you wait 5 years, and this is all we get. I expected something different and good, not the same. (Plus did you see Adam Levine on American Idol, his performance was worse than ANY of the contestants. His voice was horrible.) Don't waste you time on this album. Don't BUY THIS album...I repeat do not buy this album it is TERRIBLE~!"
5,Gonna hear this all over radio,"I cant pickup on any filler songs on this record, they all seem like possible singles. It does tend to dabble into really poppy areas but somehow doesn't detract from my overall impression. After few listens many songs are stuck in your head and will not disappear. Just succumb and buy this sucka now. The ballads are all memorable and catchy and the rockers have a frenetic energy that blend rock and pop seamlessly."
5,Maroon5 - It Won't Be Soon Before Long,"Maroon5's Songs About Jane was a good album and it spawned several hits that got a lot radio play. So when I saw this album in my local library, I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this album. It Won't Be Soon Before Long is so much better than Songs About Jane. The CD has good flow and I like the up tempo beat for the songs. I keep this album on my iPod all the time and listen to it a lot. It is great album that is foot tapping and body moving. Standout songs: If I Never See Your Face Again, Makes Me Wonder, Little of Your Time, Won't Go Home Without You, and Back At Your Door."
5,Pleasently pleased,Thought it was just as good as the first cd. Some lyrics with a catchy beat and some very heartfelt and real to life.
4,The best of Maroon 5,"I am not a Maroon Five fan, at least, not the first album. When my wife bought this one, I didn't want to listen to it. But it's different. It's got a different sound, one I like. Not bad music."
3,Not as good as their last,"I was really looking forward to this CD, because I loved that last one. But I was very disappointed the first couple times I listened to it. It's very different, in that his songs seem more mellow. It seems like he's been through a tough relationship, and all the fun and games from the first cd are over. Almost every song on the last cd were great, but there are only a few good songs on this one. Almost better to purchase just the songs you want instead of wasting money on this whole cd."
3,Not So Much,This CD is not what I had expected it to be. I enjoy listening to most of the CD but there are some songs that I choose to skip.
3,Not as catchy as Songs About Jane,"I absolutely loved Maroon 5's first album, but this one doesn't quite do it for me. The lyrics are great, however, the song itself lacks original beats. I think they should team up with Timberland or another producer to improve the sound of the album."
3,Still the Maroon 5 I know,"Classic Maroon 5 tunes (cool and catchy) but more upbeat than Songs about Jane. However, there's a lot of bitterness and anger in the songs which some people might not quite relate to though it's good to listen to if you want to blow off some steam. I'd recommend it to anyone who have had their heart broken recently."
2,"Sampling Mary Jane Girls' ""In My House""","Driving around in my car and scanning the radio stations, I came across a very familiar sounding riff and funky musical backing track from the past. It was too obvious - almost a carbon copy rip off. Assuming that a 'remake' was hitting the airwaves, I called the station and asked what/who the song playing was...and surprised me to discover ""Makes Me Wonder"" by Maroon 5. This song is lifted directly from the MARY JANE GIRLS ""IN MY HOUSE"" from back in the 80's - yup, that Rick James produced girl group that enjoyed a brief run of success. Turns out that Maroon 5 isn't very original on this track, but, since the public's memory of past musical styles fades fast into obscurity, and a new generation of music fans is buying this stuff, they'll get away with rehashing what's already been a hit, taking credit for it, and getting away with it. Go 'sample' the track here at amazon.com and see for yourselves."
1,"one good song, one decent song, and the rest...","...is hyper-produced trash. If you put this band on a stage, it would flop like a fish out of water when the backing track skips. The guy has an interesting voice; too bad it's run through a mixing board on every song. The smarmy, poppy fakeness drips through every track."
2,"More Songs About Jane, only less...","Vash, I couldn't agree with your review more.There is a song on there that sounds just like Outkast's ""Hey Ya"", 2 or 3 other ones sound like something The Police would have done, very close to ""Every Breath You Take"", and another sounds very close to Three Doors Down. Even the piano ballad that they did is very lackluster.In terms of songwriting, it seems like they were still on this ""You've done me wrong, but now I hate you, but can't get you out of my skin"" stint.Many of the same lyrics from Songs About Jane reappear on this CD, but with no sense of style.I really enjoyed their first CD, and the Jazzy-Rock-Funk feel that it had. The arrangement was well crafted, slick guitar solos, and most of the songs very catchy. I was hard-pressed to find 1 or 2 decent guitar solos on their new CD.I will sample all of the songs before I buy their next album of theirs.Disappointed..."
4,The same again,"This album is not a progression from their previous, its more of an extention. Be that as it may, i emjoyed the last album and i enjoyed this album, so they made me happy and got me to part with hard earned cash to buy this album. WELL DONE!!"
3,It's alright,"""Songs about Jane"" was good fun, so I was really looking forward to this release. However, too many songs sound too similar.With the exception of ""Makes me Wonder,"" there is just not enough hit potential for the individual songs.I enjoyed listening to the album anyway, for a week or so, before I took it out of my player and did not put it back in."
3,fastest 30 minutes of my life,"In short I saw these guys at the Belly up for 91 cents and they were incredible. They did a cover of ""Closer"" by NIN that would blow the doors off any venue! When Songs about Jane came out I couldn't believe how much of their edgy sound had been completely produced out of the final product. These guys have great potential but they are too busy selling to a commercial generation for me to realize it. At 30 minutes I think I'll pass on their next album when it comes out in 2013."
3,Not as good as the last,I like 3-4 tracks on this new ablum. I should have downloaded just the songs that I liked rahter than purchasing entire CD.
4,My boyfriend thought I was nuts....,"He thought I had lost my mind when he saw that I purchased this album, neither of us being mainstream-pop loving music fans. At all. Plus, I absolutely hated their song ""She Will Be Loved"" from the last album due to overplay on the radio and because of the whiny vocals so I can't say why I bought this cd, other than I liked the cover and wanted something new. In any case, while I don't love it, I do like it. It's oddly upbeat for such normally depressing subjects (the usual I-lost-my-love or cheated-on-them teen angsty stuff) but overall it's catchy and inoffensive. I listen to it a lot at work. Not sure I'm going to be a long-term fan, because pop really isn't my style, but it's honestly not bad for what it is."
3,Some sublime moments,"I had no preconceptions coming into this CD. Whilst I liked moments from there precious CDSongs About Jane, and that CD grew on me, in time, I waited quite awhile to pick up this CD. But pick it up I did, and, to my ears, it's a mixed bag. The sublime moments mentioned in my title would include 'Makes Me Wonder' (which I think was the first single) and is a perfect mix of funk & Rock, 'If I Never See Your Face Again, 'Wake up Call' & 'Can't stop'. Seeing that funk resonates more with me than straight out Rock/pop, so the rest of this CD doesn't move me as much. For these songs listed I'd give this 3 stars."
5,"Pure, Enjoyable Pop","Many people complain that Maroon 5's new sound is too clean, too bland - I disagree. It's catchy, clever pop music with amazing replay value. I listen to this CD over and over again and do not get tired of it - the songs have singable choruses and a good dance beat. Their music is also pretty sex-oriented - beware of younger listeners - and all songs are relationship songs!Some of the best tracks are:Won't Go Home Without YouGoodnight GoodnightKiwi (this song is really racy...watch out)Better That We BreakBack At Your DoorThere are songs with heavy beats, there are ballads, there are synthesized songs, there are sweet songs, there are angry songs - this album covers a lot of turf and is very different, but in my opinion, better, than Songs About Jane. A great sophomore album!"
1,"Coaster, Straight-Edge, Pillow, Frisbee...","...these are just some of the ways you can put your Maroon 5 CD to better use. Seriously, did anyone actually listen to this album? It's all the crappy music of the 70s and 80s revisited. It's disco rehashed and reconfigured with a corny, electronically watered-down sound to accompany it. This music is AWFUL! This album would be better suited as a breakfest table. It lacks the soul and the drive and the modicum of originality of their first release. This is merely an offering of boring lyrics, hackneyed sing-songiness, and all the same chords and melodies of by-gone eras...and not even GOOD ERAS! Why the hell would a band with so much talent and potential choose to follow up a soulful debut with disco/sounds of 80's pop trash? What is wrong with this world?"
2,First Song Ruined The Album,"Blake from American Idol got me interested in Maroon 5. I've heard some of their other songs and they were really good. Even the radio airplay of the first track on It Won't Be Soon Before Long (titled ""Makes Me Wonder"") is good. So when I bought the CD, I was a little distressed to hear lyrics such as ""It really makes me wonder if I ever gave a f*** about you"", and G**d*** my spinning head..."". The rest of the album is clean, and its a shame that the radio airplay version of ""Makes Me Wonder"" is not on this album. So, that ruined the whole album for me, and rarely listen to it now."
1,Save your money,"The only reason I gave this CD 1 star is because I can't give it a lower raiting. I became a real fan after ""Sougs About Jane"". That could be the most complete album I have ever heard. It was creative, distinct and memorable. This CD is tripe. After waiting for 5 years I am very dissapointed, to say the least. Another one hit wonder who will quickly fade."
2,Five year Wait for this?,"I loved the first album, ""Songs about Jane"". The tunes were diverse. It seemed the songs were much more thought out since if I understand correctly, it was mainly two guys writing the material. This CD is over-produced with not enough sweat in the compositional area. There are a few melodies floating around, but nothing that could stand the test of time here. What kills me is that they took so long to produce it. It sounds like a later 1970's style as disco was making it's end.....too much funky sound happening here. They sound too much like Sly and the family stone....the first CD sounded more diverse."
5,Support Autism Awareness,"Anyone that knows someone or lives with someone with autism should buy this magnet and support autism awareness. The more we see these magnets, the more we will know we are all fighting for the same rights for everyone~"
1,Never got it.,Didn't pay attention when I ordered it. Did not realize an address my daughter had 2 years ago was my default address. I assumed it was mine. So it was sent there. Never returned. So I never got it.
4,Great marker for the price,"I had only used a MR1 when I bought this marker. I really liked the look and trigger of the Vs2. When I found this marker on sale at actionvillagepaintball.com for $179 and it came with the Vs2 trigger, I had to buy it. I am glad that I did. This marker can throw some paint. It is pretty accurate stock but I put a 14"" j&j; ceramic on it and it really does well. The pressure will jump sometimes but the regulator that comes with it may just not be very good. I use 68/4500 hpa tanks and can get almost 1500 balls out of a fill. My game has gotten better from upgrading to this equipment. Don't let the Ion boys fool you. This is one of the better low end blow back markers. You can slap a Tadao board in this puppy and ramp 'till your heart's content or your buddy is covered in paint.Be safe. Wear a mask and Chrono your markers!"
1,Misleading description,I gave it one star because the company failed to disclose in the book description that the book is based on United Kingdom fin system/ accounting principals and regulations
2,Disappointing,This book merely reiterates old beliefs aboutbio-psychological mechanisms connecting themto fatigue and pain.More peer review would be welcome.New bio-medical findings about the causes ofME/CFS have been entirely left out.The book may be beneficial as a motivationaltool for people returning to work afterlong periods of unemployment or peoplewanting to start a fitness program orloose weight.
4,The Best of Kid Komedy is very Good,"This CD contains a unique combination of humor and cleverness from young people age 8-12 who study the art of stand-up comedy in Atlanta. The material is ultra clean, bright and surprisingly entertaining for adults and children. Some of the tracks are actual thigh slappers while others are more subtle. It is easy to understand how the training these young people get could give them a chance to enhance their self esteem, overcome shyness and direct their energies into a rewarding area. The record would make a fine gift for a family with children or a present for a child in the same age group as the performers."
3,the few skits of The Best of Sid Caesar,The quality of the DVD was great. I was disappointed in too few skits and too many interviews. A DVD product needs to be made ofa 4 disc continuous play of his shows like the one of Jack Benny.
5,Nothing like the old time comedians.,"It was so good to laugh with these comedians. Good, clean humor. This is what we lack in this day and age."
4,Tight As,Good fun and a wonderful dance tune! Should have been on X! Thanks to INXS and the producers for bring out some unheard material to share with the fans!
3,Interesting but outdated,"Interesting essay and accurate translation, but the theoretical construction is a bit outdated, because of the time lapsed from when it was first written and of the constraints of Wiener kreis' logical positivism"
4,I've always been a boring condom user -- ...,"I've always been a boring condom user -- generally purchasing whatever spermicide-treated condom was available, so the Trojan Ribbed Lubricated Premium Latex Condoms were a bit of a change. Fortunately, there's also a version with spermicidal lubricant. These particular condoms are comfortable and effective and we encountered no problems using them. The ribbing contributed to extra sensation as well. This is a good, fun product!"
3,My spouse and I didn't notice much difference ...,"My spouse and I didn't notice much difference between the ribbed and the regular, although they have the same comfort and quality you'd expect from Trojan. I don't know if I'd purchase these again. To others, I'd say go ahead and try -- there's not enough difference from regular condoms to be a worse experience and it could possibly be better for you."
4,DB2 Administration,"This is an in depth book that covers all the options when refering to SQL, and DB2 commands. It also covers all the topics in a comprehensive manner. I have read the DB2 for dummies and the DB2 Universal Database from IBM, and the All in One DB2 Administration completely outclasses them. However the test enginge cd promises hundreds of questions and fails to deliever. The Practice test and the ""real"" test are word for word the same...so a big disappointment in this regard.If you are buying a book to learn the material and ALL the options then this is the book to buy in preparing for the IBM DB2 513 certification. For the 512 I would use this book to study and get the DB2 fundamentals certification for Dummies book for the test engine (it has around 200 + questions).If you want a Book on performance tuning etc, there are other books out there that will cover this topic in depth much better."
3,DB2 All In One Exam Guide,They should have never released this book with the CD-ROM that does not work. The publishers were aware that the CD-ROM was full of bugs and their developers are scrambling to correct it.I am extremely dissapointed..
4,Not sufficient for Test 513,"The book is quite detailed and is best for beginners or for professionals working in some other RDBMS and wanting to swith to DB2. It should also serve as a good reference book.But it is not sufficient for test 513. The sample questions at the end of each chapter and on the CD-ROM are too easy as compared to the actual questions on test 513. I would recommend extra reading resources besides this book (like the DB2 UDB Fastpath CBT) for test 513.Thanks,Manas"
4,Good book,"Read this about 3 times and realized that some critical information were missing out. I passed my 512 without any sweat and struggling on 513 with the help of this book. Thus, i gave it 4 stars. The information and questions in this book are way too easy for 513, so don't count on those questions. Consider them as warm up and getting your engine to run.My other help:DB2 Unversal Database V6.1 rating [*****]DB2 Fundamental Certification rating [*****]EQ"
3,The Real Deal,"To begin with, Aziatic is one of the few artists that is willing to take Punta music to the next level. With that I mean instead of Punta Rock, he produces Punta Pop. He makes his sound unique by using elements of r&b, jazz and a little pop. The Most Wanted release was different than that of any punta releaase because it contained a followed-through theme. Music generates to the heart and soul of the young and old....... He's done an Okay Job."
2,Too much for too little,"I read several previous reviews thinking this would be 100 pages of genuine in-depth help to assist the single guy in the dating world. Instead it felt like an over done Maxim article that was stretched out over 100 pages. It did have it's humorous points and some of the topics might prove helpful to some. However, you're better off spending your money on a cheap subscription to Maxin and grabbing a pint at your local dive bar with some friends."
5,Excellent Retelling,I loved this one. The fruits of nastiness and miserliness are eternal condemnation. The fruits of loyalty and conscientious work are rewarded. All this is bound up in an excellent retelling of an An.N. Afanasyev Russian folktale. The illustrations by Igor Galinin are rich yet fanciful.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I had to re-read the other reviews of this book to see if I read the same book that they gave five stars . The book is too short, doesn't give out any information that you couldn't find in the first chapter of any decent real estate primer, and the over-all impression is that it is the result of a short interview with the authors who appear based on their credits to be qualified to give meaningful insights but in fact don't reveal anything. As a real estate professional and a person who has a number of real estate books in his library this book belongs in the round file at the end of my book shelf. I am glad I only wasted twelve dollars.Apparently they have coined a new term ""orchestra funding"" and are attempting to force it into the real estate lexicon. An exceptional disappointment in every sense of the word."
1,Waste of paper,"This is the first book I ever threw into the recycle bin instantly after reading it. There is ZERO instruction on how to do anything, just stories about past investors. LAME.I want my dollar back!"
1,Spark: Don't waste your time,This book is nothing more than a sales tool for an investment fund and should come with appropriate disclaimers. No information whatsoever about how to become a hard money lender and to boot it is poorly written. Save your money and time. The one star is only because there are no negatives.
5,The best,"Bentley manuals in general are better than Haynes or Chilton (I don't think either make a Fox manual anyway.) Detailed, straightforward. As others have said, it's the Bible for Foxers and probably for VW owners in general."
4,Some kickass rock and roll,"I didn't know what to expect and was really surprised, and happy, with this album. Some great, kickass rock and roll (hints of early Police and Bryan Adams) that you can sing AND dance to. Worth checking out. """
2,Caveat Emptor,"I should have read these reviews before-and not after-purchasing one of these players, for I experienced the same problem described by the reviewer from Canada. After one week of use, the unit began to reject certain discs that would play without any difficulty in other DVD players. Either it failed to read a disc and gave a ""disc error"" message or it read the disc but failed to show the movie. Not wanting to deal with the frustrations of a possibly defective unit, I returned it at once to Circuit City for a full refund and bought a Panasonic player (model S29), which, as of this writing, is working just fine. For those of you considering this Zenith product, my advice is ""Let the buyer beware."""
5,Wonderful and informative reclamation,"This is the best of the books on the WASP program to be published to date. Relying on first-hand interviews and recently declassified documents, Clipped Wings consistently demonstrates that the US failed this group of dedicated veterans.Of special importance is its amplication of feminist military critiques to an actual branch of the military, proving what before had been strictly theory. The best chapters are those that include numerous examples of media sexism and the ridiculous thought patterns of Congress--two elements of culture that unfortunately still impact women who enter male-dominated fields."
2,no good for my old english sheepdog,"This did not work well on my old english sheepdog...I have one with half the teeth that works a lot better. I think that maybe my dog's coat is too long and thick for this brush? Maybe better for a dog with wiry hair ie. terrier or something. It just glides over my dog's coat rather than penetrating through thye top coat to the under coat. A Well-Made product, just doesn't work on my dog."
1,Lovely to write with. Seriously sub-standard quality control,I can only speak for my experience with this pen as sold by Irv's Luggage.I really enjoy how well this pen writes but you cannot deny the poor workmanship or quality control. The pen I received-- the chrome coloured paint was already flaking off the top of the pen the moment it was out of the box. Please see the picture I posted to highlight.
1,"Oh, no...not another anthology!!!","There ain't anything new here, folks. If you've been a JD fan for even the last 10 years, you already have every single one of these songs. The only difference is that the recording included here of ""Is It Love?"" is a studio version released in Australia. The song showed up as a live track on the recording of ""The Wildlife Concert"" in the mid-'90's. That's about it. This release is nothing but a blatent attempt to make ""the suits"" at Sony/BMG a few more dollars. If there IS something available that has never been released before, THEN RELEASE IT! Stop insulting John's memory with the upteenth-hundred anthology of his work! ENOUGH!"
5,Essential John Denver,"Probably the best CD for John Denver, but there are 20 or more to pick from and they have different performances of the the same songs- so homework is required. I don't know how folks in Denver feel, but there's alot of love for John Denver in my Kansas family!!!"
5,excellent CD,If you enjoy the soothing music of John Denver this CD is a must! You'll be able to sing along to every song.
2,Disc 1 has noise.,disc 1 has a recording flaw. On my usual CD player you can hear the search sequence trying to read it. It will play but the noise is annoying. On another player it plays with a clicking noise in the background. Both player work fine with disc 2 and with other CDs.
3,Great Music - Again,"I couldn't agree more with the first review of this compilation - enough is enough! I give the music 5 stars; the folks who released it one star. These repeated compilations all feature the same 15-20 big hits, plus some extra tracks. Whether these songs are the ""essential"" ones is certainly up for debate. I would prefer a collection of 35 songs without the big hits...2-3 album cuts from each of JD's albums..this would be a better collection. There is nothing from 1988's excellent ""Higher Ground"" album on this ""essential collection"". Of all the compilation/live albums out there, I would most recommend the Wildlife Concert or the Harbor Lights concert. The former is a bit heavier on the hits, the latter has many of the hits, but a good mix of lesser known, but still great songs spanning many phases of JD's illustrious career."
5,great service,Order from Amazon came quickly and in great shape. I would recommend this to anyone looking for great music at a great price.
5,A desert-island tactics book - hundreds of positions,"In one of my other reviews I got my LeMoir books mixed up. I meant to refer to ESSENTIAL CHESS SACRIFICES, his awesome collection of modern sacrificial themes which I would urge any attacking player to read. But his earlier work HOW TO BECOME A DEADLY CHESS TACTICIAN is also a book I enjoyed and benefited from. So many positions from the master games were not familiar to me (and I own a lot of books), and his practical advice on finding combinations (or cunning swindles) is superb.This is so much material crammed into these LeMoir books - months of reading material rather than weeks or days. A LeMoir trait is to give several similar examples of the same sacrificial or tactical concept, but in slightly varied settings, which is so helpful. Don't let some other ignorant reviewers put you off - this is a book of real quality, which will give you a competitive edge in games. The five stars are fully deserved."
4,Nice combinations,"This book contains a nice collection of combinations and tactical motifs. In addition to being a great learning book, it is also a lot of fun to read. I really like this author, and look forward to reading How to Be Lucky in Chess.Before starting in on this book, you might consider first reading Seirawan and Silman's superb Winning Chess Tactics, just to nail down the basic tactical elements. Another tactical book that is very enjoyable to read and that could benefit almost any player is The Inner Game of Chess (focusing on calculation) by Soltis. Since Lemoir does not spend a lot of time in this book on calculation, The Inner Game complements it nicely.Bottom line: An enjoyable and effective book."
2,"Not an ""How to book...""","Sorry this book dont teach nothing, is full of examples but the method for calculation is absolutely not present, there is even a chapter called ""How not to calculate..."" ! thank you! I bought this book to learn how to calculate tactics!But paradoxically the only advice on how to calculate is given in this 3 pages (suggestion borrowed from Kotov, Tisdal and Dvoretsky) but without any example, method or exercice.If you want some nice commented examples and few exercises here and there go for this book, if you want to improve how to calculate and become good at it, look somewhere else.Maybe Practical Chess by Nunn is a good starting point.Being a good player dont mean being a good teacher."
2,Nice for beginners,"Hi, I think this book is surtenly not what I had expected. I am a 2000 rated player, and for me this book wasn't exactly what I had in mind. That games in the books I already knew, so as the diagrams that is, however it is a good book for beginners. It is explained in a simple manner, and the drawings make it look like it's a book for little children to fill in the drawings with their own colourpencils.So the conclusion is simple: are you 1300-1800 you can try this book, are you 1800+ then don't."
1,Amazon.com to the rescure,"The movie was very dark and with a lot of contrast,that made it not viewable.Amazon.com refunded my purchase after i could not contact Deep-Dish-Discount whom sold me the video.They would not return emails and there mailbox was full.I will continue to purchase from Amazon.com."
3,"Boring, but Ok","This CD series was ""sold"" to me as an ""After Pimsleur"" vocabulary enrichment course. Well, it has nothing to do with Pimsleur, which is very engaging and entertaining. Yes, you do learn a lot of vocabulary and usuful expressions, but it is just by plain repetition, very boring I must say. The music in the backgroung is meant to break the monotony, but quite frankly, I find it annoying.I guess it is ok for the price, after all."
4,Useful supplement to other materials,"I am using a variety of materials and methods to improve my level of Spanish: private lessons, occasional immersion weeks, Pimsleur CDs, coursebooks, [...], etc. At this stage in my studies, my limited vocabulary is a bottleneck to further progress; these CDs are helping me break through to the next level by imprinting a fairly substantial core vocabulary in my head. I use two techniques for ""imprinting"" the vocabulary. First, I listen to the CD and try to say the words out loud. Second, with the English to Spanish CDs, I listen again (usually later in the day or the next day) and try to write down the Spanish words before I hear them spoken. I'm a visual learner, and the combination of writing something down and then reinforcing it by hearing it spoken seems to be helping.I'm about to starting studying Portuguese next week, and I've got the Portuguese Vocabulearn CDs, too."
5,Really works,"I bought three climbing Don Juan roses by mail and one was doing OK, but the other two refused to grow much . I tried slow-release rose fertilizer and nothing happened. When I applied the miracle gro rose plant food there were new leaves in two days, and in 1 week each plant went from about 12 inches high to 18 inches ! They grew as much in 1 week as they'd grown the previous 2 months! This was truly amazing.(I tried it on other more mature roses and did not get any amazing improvement, although theykept growing at a good rate.)"
4,Glad to find it somewhere,Our local Lowe's carried this product until last year and it would last through the summer. I can use it weekly without concerns of damaging our established or new rose bushes. I've looked for it in other local stores but they only carry 4 or 8 oz boxes for inflated prices. I was thrilled to see that Amazon carries it for a reasonable price. I bought TWO boxes for our expanding garden. Thanks Amazon for being THE source for just about everything. I use another product once very six weeks for bug and disease control but this REALLY brings out those blooms.
5,Captivating impression of an American classic,"Phyllis Curtin's voice is impeccably suited to this music. Listen for yourself to the opening sample from ""Ain't It A Pretty Night?"" and let the idiomatic quality of her clear diction convince you. It's like the homespun spoken voice of Aunt Eller or Auntie Em applied to the stylings and technical expertise of a master singer (who was responsible for some phenomenal master classes, by the way). The atmospheric qualities of a live recording add to the spontaneous, incidental, convincing delivery of her words. It is truly as though we are looking in. I never tire of listening to this recording."
3,Very Interesting,"This recording of Floyd's Susannah is one of only two available. The other recording, which stars Cheryl Studer, is a studio recording. This one, however, was recorded live. This is the main cause for the lack of quality sound. You can still hear everything, but it's not the most pleasent sounding all the time. Ms. Curtain gives a nice performance of the title role, although her vocal quality doesn't seem to fit the character. The orchestra is almost never with the singers - this even includes the climatic moment in Susannah's beautiful ""Ain't it a Pretty NIght?"", which leads to great dissapointment on the listeners part. It's a nice recording to have perhaps for it's historical context, but for overall enjoyment of one of the most beautful American Opera scores ever written, I highly recommend the other recording starring Cheryl Studer and Jerry Hadley. Even with Ms. Studer's consistant flatness in pitch, her performance is exhilerating."
2,Dissapointing,"This ""live"" taping done for this CD must have been of poor quality. The coughs of audience members are clearly heard, etc.In some portions of the vocals I could not make out what was said. If I had not known the story I would have had no clue as to what transpired. Too bad such talent as Curtin's was so poorly represented."
5,"Pawns of War, an excellent in-depth history of the loss.","I found the book at an Aviation Bookstore in Clearwater Fl.I had an uncle who was a P40 pilot on board and have always been searching for more info, my dad's details were sketchy. This book provides an excellent, detailed, and disturbing account of the sinking of the Langley, the pick up of survivors by the Pecos and subsequent sinking of the Pecos as well. It reads as another story of bungling Navy planning and a needless loss.I would be very interested in hearing more about the ship, possible survivors, and official recognition of those lost at sea."
4,The Sight,"I first saw this movie as a TV program that was interrupted by severe weather, so I lost much of the story line. After watching the DVD version without interruptions I found it very entertaining and well done. The casting was really good with the character of Alice Cooper stealing much of the show for me, as children so often do. For those who enjoy this genre, i.e. supernatural vision drama, this movie works well. Like much of today's Hollywood production, the chase scenes at the conclusion were somewhat overdone but did not greatly detract from the story. Being in England set a tone or mood in the movie that could only be achieved there. Not a great movie, but really good entertainment - a movie that can be enjoyed by repeated viewings."
2,McCarthy is back in a bomb.,"Useless piece of movie by director Anderson. He apparently used this movie as a laboratory or as a stop-gap between his bigger Hollywood productions like Alien x Predator and Resident Evil 2.Shot in London, this movie has the merit of bringign Andrew McCarthy back. He's a fine actor who unfortunately dissapeared from the big roles. And he does not have a big role here, but at least it's the main role, and he does a fine job.The story is pedestrian and perfunctory, but anyway the photography has a certain style."
5,Cool Gong!,"I was surprised by the sound quality; it's amazing and kind of addictive (you will want to hear it often).It's a little small but, still, the sound is big."
4,"Nibbles-n-Bits, amusing romantica","I read Nibbles-n-Bits a while ago. This is a lighthearted and fun anthology which accomplishes its intent of making the reader both smile and squirm on his/her seat (romantica is rather explicit). Though it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I would definitely recommend it to all lovers of erotic romance, particularly those that like paranormals with a touch of humor."
3,Beginner's cheesemaking book,"I have this book. It was published in 1977 and is paperback. I don't remember where I bought it but I think it was in the one dollar pile at one of the many used bookstores here in Los Angeles. This is cheesemaking at its most elementary. Author Glynn Christian, a New Zealander who used to be cookery adviser to Thames Television, uses cultured buttermilk as his starter in all the recipes. This is fine and many other authors on cheesemaking give this alternative to professional cultures as a method for beginners (one can also use live yoghourt or live kefir) but he uses an archaic form of measuring acidity by titrating the ripening milk with phenolphthalein and Sodium Hydroxide - dangerous and messy - instead of pH paper. I would suggest a more up-to-date book - ""Cheesemaking made easy"" by Ricki and Robert Carroll or the free recipes on any of the home cheesemaking websites."
3,For cheese lovers,Very basic and pretty much out of date. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it when there are newer books on the market.A better choice would be Home Cheese Making by Rikki Carroll. That has to be the best cheesemaking book on the market today.Home Cheese Making: Recipes for 75 Delicious Cheeses
1,how to be an oi band,"Strange how people consider this oi......what chant oi a couple of times, a few references to working and a lame cover of a cocksparrer song and you join the club? Not in my book. This cd is part of a generation of unoriginal dull street punk bands, e.g randumbs, patriot, bodies and pressure point playing strictly to the genre they have boxed themselves into. For Kansas City residents only."
3,good if you like the show,This is a good game if you like the show. If you arent already a fan you probably wont like the game. It sometimes gets very repetitive where you need to hit one guy 20 times with either a kick or a punch while 3 others are comeing at you. All in all it's a pretty good game if you like the show.
3,"well, not quite a blaze of glory...","It's clear that da Kinkstah's books have been losing steam the last few years. They kept getting shorter, and sadder. More chapeters devoted to dead friends and lost lovers. All worth the read, but increasingly unsatisfying compared to materpieces like Elvis Jesus and Coca Cola. This book, to be honest, is no exception.So it was with mixed emotions that I found author Kinky Friedman killing off the detective Kinky Friedman in this novel. Sure, their paths have long diverged - the real Kinky has moved from Greenwich Village back to Texas and even Greenwich Village itself has moved on. The Village Irregulars have probably all lost their rent-controlled apartments and moved to Brooklyn and there's no way lesbian dance instructors or washed-up country singers could afford warehouse space. Keep hope alive though - there's no mention of a body, so Kinky Friedman the detective may just be resurrected one day when the real Kinky starts to miss him."
5,Nice.,"Works well for reaching across the roof of my trucks without having to stand in the open door and reach across. Soft bristles, head is a little large for smaller areas."
3,Bad hose connection,"Overall, it's a good telescoping handle. However, for the price, I would expect one that was water tight. Mine was not. I replaced the gasket at the base twice, but it leaks all the time (running or not). There is no way to use it without getting wet."
4,Very Good,Just finished using this book as part of an Astrophysics corse in University College Cork. It has a straight forward layout and with lucid explanations of the essential topics.
4,Excellent CD,"I'll admit it, it took me about a dozen spins before I really warmed up to this album, but after I did, I couldn't stop listening to it! It is really a wonderful, understated release. The lead singer is a unique talent and the band pulls it all together. If you are a fan of Wilco, The Smith, Promise Ring, Death Cab for Cutie, Jeff Buckley, etc....or anywhere in between, check out this album."
1,Gave up after three faulty players,"I bought this as a gift for my son and were reasonably very pleased at first. He loved listening to stories and music. However the menus were not that user friendly and the buttons were frustratingly unreliable, often requiring several presses to get a response.We eventually returned the first unit when we purchased a SD card and discovered the memory card reader would only work whilst holding in the card.The replacement unit did not function at all, right out the box. The third unit worked for about an hour, before the switches stopped working, though the backlight would turn on. We finally gave up, but were pleased to get a full refund.Unfortunately we've not been able to find anything similar, which is a shame as we really liked the general concept of a mini MP3 boombox."
1,Do not buy!!!!,I have had nothing but troubles with this boom box. The concept is great but it just doesn't work as advertized. Right now it is not working at all and it has been too long since I purchased so I don't think I can return it. I tried to get in touch with Coby but they don't have a phone number listed on their web site. I sent and email but got no answer. I wonder how some companies stay in business. I regret buying this product and I do not recomend it. I won't buy anything from Coby since if there is a problem there is no way to get support.
1,Another false product information,"Doesn't matter how good or how bad a product is, I will give it zero star when I am lied to: the 4xC batteries are NOT included, and the USB port is only 1.1, not ""ultra fast 2.0"" as indicated in the product information.On top of that: the player does not resume where it left off on the SD card, the alarm function on my new unit does not work (set to FM).The saving graces: AC adapter is included, funtions as a conventional alarm clock (that is if the alarm works) with radio(FM only)/stored music/buzz/snooze button, sleep timer, plays mp3, direct mp3 encoding, option to resume at beginning of track or at the exact point where left off, and very small internal memory (256mb, imagine if larger would wait forever for the usb 1.1 to transfer), the backlit light is bright orange is as good as a night light. But all the settings need to be done through navigating the menu, not convenient as a conventional alrm clock.Oy vey. But FYI."
4,"Witty, endearing Regency.","Miss Phoebe Lowell had thought nothing of taking a position at the Coalport Pottery Works, but Lieutenant Bennett Holden and his contemporaries thought it beneath a woman to have such menial employment. As Phoebe tired of her lodging in a women's dormitory, she wished to live at Holden House. Posing as Ben Holden's fiancée, she sneaked into the house, but it wasn't long that the engagement would soon become real. Martha Kirkland writes a very endearing story of Regency life here. Phoebe is a strong heroine, doing what some consider menial, but it is truly work that she loves. The interplay between Phoebe and Ben is witty, and the conflicts strong."
2,Gives incorrect status,"I really do not understand this device. When I plug it into a phone socket which works perfectly for an actual telephone, the device reports ""reversed polarity"". I reported this to the vendors and they sent me a replacement but it behaves the same. Is there a rampant QA problem with the manufacturers (Vanco), or am I missing something?"
3,Does the job,"This product does the job, but it is not spectacular. I really abuse the inside of my shoes and they can smell like old moldy sweat socks. This product handles my shoe funk pretty good after a few uses. I would recommend this product but don't expect miracles."
4,works,"Bought this for a new pair of boots that had an odd odor, sort of like cigars?? After the first use a bit better. 3 uses finally eliminated the odor entirely"
1,Save your money; not worth the price,I have this program. It is not worth the money. You could buy a few good books for the price of this program. The CDs are low quality too.His marketing ideas can be found in most basic marketing books.
2,Just a surface view,"I, too, ordered this book from the website. Although I did not return it, I was disapointed. Yes, it is about using advertising rather than prospecting, but you have to do both in a sales career. And advertising is a good tool to use, but can kill you financially if you aren't savvy. This is where this book really drops the ball. A few good ideas, but no clear direction on how to implement anything. In my opinion, not at all worth the money. Spend your time reading free articles on the internet - you will learn more and spend far less than what you will get out of this book."
1,No marketing knowledge here,"This was the first in the author's sham marketing books. As usual, it's zero content with zero value for anyone who runs a business. I presume he lives of seminars and infomercials since all his books seem to follow this pattern."
1,Poor writing and execution,"Fantastic sales process in selling these publications, great online techniques - however there is no delivery of value as far as I am concerned. I suspect Frank is a good salesman - but a bad writer. Glad to see others got value out of it - none for me. Not satisfied with the purchase."
1,Overpriced book of marketing,"The book is about using advertising instead of prospecting. I got the book at thier web site and returned it. The book talks about using direct mail and flyers instead of canvasing and telephone prospecting. He also talks about speaking at seminars as a good tool. However, the book does not give good examples of these. Save your money and buy books on direct mail and generating referrals, as this is what the book tells you to do, to get leads."
1,A stylized cinematic mess,"The director of this film had some beautiful, young, & talented women to work with, but rather than concentrate on producing either an erotic video with horror overtones or a horror video with erotic overtones, he decided instead to try something artsy and avante garde --- and ended up with this piece of trash that is neither scary nor erotic.Seriously, how can you possibly mess up a video with lesbian vampires? I didn't think it was possible until I watched this one. The plot is rambling and confusing, the sex scenes are one dimensional and uninteresting, and the video as a whole is silly and pretentious. This one is a disappointing waste of talented, beautiful actresses. I would have settled for one really good erotic moment but sadly it never arrived."
2,"good nudity, horrible film","Like i said, very good nudity, almost too much of it in the film. There is barely any dialogue, instead it's a soft-core lesbian film. The problem with Anthony Marsiglia's films, is that the film opens up with a sex scene or two, and then when you read about it, it sounds interesting or worth watching. But instead his way of directing, is just terrible, because he tuns a perfect story into a confusing sex film. The reason why people might be intrigued by the concept, is because Lust For Dracula is supposed to be a lesbian reinterpretation of Bram Stoker's: Dracula. Also Lust for Dracula has a lot of gratuitous nudity throughout, and was non-stop. This sounds good, ""right"" ""wrong."""
1,This movie Stinks.....,This movie Stinks Because It really wasn't that interesting. There wasn't much that excitement in there. All there was Was Bloodsucking and Vampires an Everything.
3,Tales worth staying up for,"Another fine mash up brought to you by FORE TET! It's not for everyone, it did take a while for it to soak in, but now its on heavy rotation! Go ahead and get this one son! good job fore tet!"
2,Glorified Prologue to Potential B-Movie,"I picked this up mainly because I've been digging Joe Casey's work lately, but also because I wanted to read a few more AiT books before deciding whether or not to write them off completely as not my thing. Publisher Larry Young is big on the high concept, and Full Moon Fever delivers in that regard, with a pretty simple pitch: werewolves on the moon. Unfortunately, it does absolutely nothing with the idea, stretching out what could easily be the opening 10 minutes of an entertaining B-movie into an overpriced, novella length OGN. Astronauts arrive at deserted moonbase, discover slaughtered scientists, discover werewolves, get picked off one by one, one survivor escapes, end of story. Or is it? One-dimensional characters and a by-the-numbers plot do little to complement Damian Couciero's solid b&w artwork, and the throwaway cliffhanger on the final page left me annoyed that I'd effectively paid $12.95 for a glorified prologue."
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the description, I expected this to be a dramatized reading of the short story. Unfortunately it is a slide show with a voice over. The English reading is good and the photographs are very good but the slide show is reminiscent of a teenager gone crazy on PowerPoint. The volume of the English version is very low, making it hard to hear in anything but a silent room. It is not a product that I would recommend. Sorry."
5,Brilliant!,A heart-stopping story that unfolds brilliantly. The characters are intense and powerful. A huge bravo to Pamela for taking on the challenging conflict between religions! Well done - this adds so much reality!
2,There's better things to watch.,"The plot was OK, but I think there were some big plot holes: was the 'parentless kids' connection ever explained?, Why was the star made to beleive she was pregnant??? And she was easily able to kill that guy in the end.Agrivating scene: the police let the people accused of murder take the accuser into the building against her will!!!!"
3,Im Not Sure...,"I was forced to read this book for my spanish class at school, so that probably makes me hate it a little bit, but besides that i dont like history novels. This is about a girl(Victoria) in the times of the romans. She has to get an herence from a relative but there s alot of differences because of the religions....the family that gave the herence wanted her to marry a cousin cuz that way the money stays in the family. is really short thought. but not unlikeable at all."
5,wow.,"well, what can you say? george just keeps getting better and better! a great dance single with a smart, 21st century twist that cleverly intergrates sly jabs at the state of modern media with tongue-in-cheek references to george's own personal history. there is a lot going on here, both aurally and lyrically - certainly a step up from what one finds in the average pop song these days. bravo george."
4,Great CD,Need to be warned about the language. It's not for kids in my opinion. But I have loved his music from day one.
5,"Reality shown hanging, in all it's twisting honesty","Rita Mae Brown has written a modern classic about the vagaries of life itself and the interaction of various people throughout life and from a variety of perspectives. It is easy to love the characters in this book, mainly because they are presented as well rounded and complete people, but also because we see in them members of our own lives. I read constantly and from all genres of writing, without any doubt this is my favorite book of the thousands I have read. I first read ""Six of One"" twenty years ago and am right now waiting for my fifth copy from the bookstore. I wore the pages out of the others amid much laughter and tears."
2,"Sorry, Kathy","A dear friend loved and recommended this book...said she rereads it about once a year. On top of that...all these good reviews here. I must be turning into a crotchety old lady, because I read as long as I could before I became too aggravated with the childish conversations that made the adults seem silly & boring. When does it start to become a wonderful read? Did I give up too early? Ah well.."
2,Funny book but too many grammar mistakes,"I enjoyed the plot and the characters -- it was very funny. But there were too many grammar mistakes in the book, which I found too irritating and distracted from the book. Some conversations did not flow logically -- one person would answer herself, which didn't make sense. Also, the author switches from 1st person to 3rd person with the character of Nickel. And she used 'to' instead of 'too.' As a former copy editor and English major, this was very distracting! But overall, a great book. I plan on getting the next 2."
3,be prepared to stick to it to read the whole thing,"this was a hard one to get through. it tells the stories of two sisters growing up, as well as their mom, and the woman she works for who is also her good friend. some parts of the book are SO GOOD and some are SO BORING. it's weird..."
2,Six of One,"This paperback was a long time coming, and was in heavily foxed condition. I would not order from this seller again."
1,A Sneaky Pie Brown Mystery you are not!!!,The strong lesbian overtones of this book disappointed me and I stopped reading it. I will not allow my teenage daughter to read this. We are avid fans of Sneaky Pie Brown mysteries and I erroneously assumed this would be of that caliber. Reader beware!
5,laughed so hard that i nearly peed,"This book rings so true for me. I can see my various relatives and neighbors in Rita Mae's skillfully developed characters, and I always enjoy her razor-sharp wit. I particularly like how few people in Runnymede make much of a deal out of Nickel and Mr. Pierre's sexual orientation, and accept them as they are."
5,One of the Best!,One of my favorite books of all time. I laugh till I cry and try to read it at least once a year.
5,"Hilarious and poignant, it's a small literary masterpiece","Rita Mae Brown's hysterically funny look at family relationships and Southern small town whackiness is a true delight. Her characters are unforgettable: Celeste, Cora, Jutts and Wheezie will become dear friends if not slightly demented members of your own family. Brown's ear for dialogue is near perfect in this jewel of a book. Spanning most of the 20th century, the novel takes a hard yet compassionate view of humanity, as seen in the little Mason-Dixon line town of Runnymede. Unmissable"
2,Low Audio Quality,"Sound quality is strikingly poor for a concert that was transferred onto DVD-Audio. The bass was way too heavy - had to turn down my subwoofer even to listen. Also some obvious distortion in the vocals although not on every track. The playing is decent, sometimes pretty good, but for me, not good enough to make up for the poor sound quality. I own two other DVD-A's from the Live from the Front Row series, Kingfish and Commander Cody and they both sound way better than this."
5,Better read about what I am buying,I love Robert Gordons work I have all he has rtecorded even to owning a 78rpm of his and a great dvd. I thought this was yet another dvd and of sorts it is but only with shots of him on screen as each track plays. With that said the musics great and from now on I will read a little closer before I part with the hard earned apart from that if your a fan you gotta have it.Al Watts
4,running bottles,These bottles seem to be insanely expenise for waht they are but they are the same price prety much everywhere...and when you need replacements you have no choice. The bottles fit perfectly into my fuel beltand are great for distance running. only 1 questions...why are they packaged in 4's when fuel belt holds 6 bottles?
1,Christmas Movie? Seriously?,"Movies are my life. I love movies, any kind of movie (except reality...well, anything) yet I am still trying to figure out why anyone would even produce this one. It is hands down the WORST so called Christmas movie I have ever watched. I only got through the entire thing because I kept waiting for something good to happen, which by the way NEVER did, at least not until the end credits came. It was not joyous, heartwarming or even remotely close to Christmas cheer. Drugs, family despair and hate are not what I call a happy Christmas movie. I never realized how normal my family was until investing two hours of my life, which unfortunately I will never get back, into this film so I guess I should thank the people who stupidly put the time and money into this. So thank you and have a Merry Christmas."
3,Mom's point of view,"This was a nice little movie...I was an extra in this movie, which was a fun experience. The story is heart-warming. It's a good one to watch with your teen-agers during the holidays."
3,Classic Frances!,This double CD has most of her old songs and the voice is not that great but in cabaret she probably was terrific.
3,Get Get Shorty/Skip Be Cool,"Get Shorty is one of the funniest novel adaptations, and it mirrors the book almost perfectly. Be Cool, the sequel (book) is almost as good as Get Shorty. The movie Be Cool is abominable. I simply cannot believe that Elmore Leonard allowed the movie makers to butcher his novel so badly, or that the great cast allowed themselves to be used in such a sordid way. Read both, see Get Shorty, please don't waste your time with the movie Be Cool."
3,Get Shorty/Get Real!,"The movie, Get Shorty, had to much bad language. Be Cool was a lot better and funnier"
4,Keeps moving,A read to turn the pages. Plenty of red herrings to keep you guessing and enough action to reward your perseverance. Good job.
3,Pretty good---worth the time,I enjoyed this book but it's not a GREAT book. The Monks character is much too much like a cop to be a doctor...hard to buy that one. Too many different threads running around; even the last chapter that attempted to tie up the loose ends was a huge stretch.
2,Short enough to not make you angry,"""How we eat"" is a fairly uninteresting book that, happily, is breezily written, this making it fast to read and allowing the reader to find that there seems to be no point without undue waste of time and without becoming too angry at the lack of research or fact-checking (of minor points, such as the page 181 reference to Doc Marten boots).The book comprises armchair musings on various aspects of food, heavily flavored with facile Freudian analyses (suitably lacking in rigor, as befits psychoanalytic ""theory""), with some Marxian analysis thrown, but not well mixed, in.Unfortunately, I really cannot think of any point in reading this book. I read it because I'd already bought it and carried it with me to bide the waiting time during a thorough medical exam. I wish I'd brought (and bought) something else.The best thing about this book is the cover: the illustration by John Martin is stunning, but you can see it on this page, can't you?"
2,Mildly interesting,"Rappoport's ""How We Eat"" does describe many ways of considering and consuming food, however the sum of these descriptions and random narratives and quotations adds to very little. Interesting, sometimes amusing, rarely useful."
2,Not so impressed,"I bought a home where this oven was already in place.It is a basic no frills oven which is fine but it is rather small. I have cookie sheets that I cannot use at all because this oven is too small.Ham, chicken or turkey must be under 8 lbs if you want to use both racks and the top rack burns food pretty quickly if one isn't careful.I'd say if one isn't a real cooking type, this would be great but not for a person that is and likes to use both racks.I'm not sure how long this one has been in this house but all of a sudden it won't work which doesn't exactly help me like it much."
5,Awesome fricking CD!!,"You must get this CD, it has amazing songs on it and I cannot stop listening to it. It's very sad that they split up. I think that they could've went far. The lead singer Frank Iero (who is also a guitarist in my other favorite band MCR) is one of my biggest inspirations in life and I gotta say, his voice sounds just amazing. Get this CD, you will not be dissapointed."
5,Veronica honestly has the voice of an angel,"Veronica Nunn inspires and stimulates the spirit. And... she is simply wonderfully, wonderfully gifted as a musician. She's both contemporary and yet fundamentally inspiring. If the world needed a pick me up, Ms. Nunn would be my first candidate for living up to the task."
1,"Badly manufactured, alas","I believe that this CD has had a perverse pressing. I've purchased it three times, twice new and once used, and on all three occasions one or both of the discs fails to play completely. They skip, then die. I have tried them out them on four different players of mine, and on those of a friend; I do not think my equipment is to blame.... which is terrible, because these recordings represent the best Gieseking I know. Let us hope for another release."
4,Ultimate Railroads 6 DVD Gift Set,"I enjoy railroad videos and this one seems very complete. I enjoyed the old Public Relations videos, produced by the various railroads. Dvd quality was quite good too."
1,Subpar,I have been a Stroke 9 fan since 1999 and I was extremely disappointed when I purchased this CD. The songs are low quality and will have the listener wondering if this is really the Stroke 9 that they love and always listened to. Do yourself a favor and buy a different CD.
5,Retro 51 pen,"This is an oversized pen with a sticky grip. It's been my ""Go-To"" pen for several years. Make sure to get the jumbo size and the rubberized grip. I have some neuropathy issues in my hands and this makes a big difference. I also appreciate the knurled open/closed selector and the overall design. One caveat- I use Fisher Space Pen refills. The one that comes with the pen has leaked before. Perhaps this has been rectified but I ruined some pant legs previously."
4,Dark Music,"I would definitely have to say this is dark. Don't get me wrong, I like the music. It is quite a refreshing departure from the average garbage being put out by the so called top artists these days. It is music you can just kick back, close your eyes, and enjoy the ride with.One comment though. I was sitting here listening to it and it really reminds me of a much older group called ""Dead Can Dance"". I have a feeling there is a bit of an influence from that group in here. Anyway, I really like the music and would highly recommend it to anyone not stuck inside the musical box that surrounds most people these days."
5,Better Than FIFA,"I am from England where ever loves FIFA but now there is a new footy game on the market and everyone is turning. In the UK its called Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and i have had ever single one of them sice Pro Evo 1. They all better than FIFA because it has better game play and is much fast than FIFA which is slow and boring not like the beautiful game of football but the only thing FIFA has over Pro Evo is that it has better graphics and has the real names, which is made up for in gameplay. This is a great game playing against your mates because the pace of the game is gets much faster. This is much better than FIFA and the more people that buy it the more real kits and names there will be on the game SO BUY IT."
2,Dissapointing... not for soccer purists,"Maybe I was expecting too much out of it, but after playing it for 30 minutes I realized how FIFA 2005 is worth every single penny. Although the graphics are outstanding, the movements of the players are dull and robotic. The players' jerseys nearly look like the real ones for most teams, and some local teams don't even exist. There are two teams called ""Pampa"" and ""Patagonia"" (WTF???????) with the colors barely similar to Boca Juniors and River Plate, whose players have fake names that sound like the real ones (""Atontanchieri"" instead of ""Abondanzzieri"", and so on). If you like to play a game that looks realistic from any aspect, go for FIFA 2005."
2,SMALL,From the picture I expected a big beautiful palm tree. What I got was a tiny toy version of a palm tree. Read fine print on size!
1,I would not buy any item from Forever Silk even if you paid me,"I bought a ""palm plant"" made by Forever SilkForever Silk 17-FL4548 Silk Bamboo Palm Treeand still regret it. I've never come across a real plant that looks remotely like the thing I bought: it's a glued hodgepodge of twigs and leaves, assembled with as little care and aesthetic sense as a drunk squirrel would bring to the job. I can't imagine that this palm tree is any better than what I bought. Amazon should be ashamed to carry such overpriced trash."
3,the little palm,it's fine - I purchased it for staging. somehow I misjudged 17 inches - it's a little small for my needs.
4,weeellll...,"i seem to be the only person to have reviewed this, eh? yes. well, anyway, it was good for what it is. which is a book, as you well know..or do you?it could have been translated better, or just written better, depending on if you read it in french or english. i've only had the opportunity to do so in english, and it was good..but some parts make no sense and are written oddly. but good. ish.so, in conclusion, it deserves FOUR (count 'em, FOUR) stars. yesh.-me."
4,bed caps,This item was exactly what it said in the demensions. I was worried I bought the wrong size becasue I have a small bed. I was able to just peel off the back side of the double sidded tape on the back side of the end cap and stick them on. They have been on my truck ever since and has protected my truck bed more times than i want to count.
4,PURE NOSTALGIA FOR BABY BOOMERS.,"Most of those born between the end of WWII and the late 1950s remember a time when moms delighted the family with wonderful meals that looked as if they'd taken hours to prepare. This was a time before political correctness, the ""Food Police"", and before the fast food industry took over. All the popular staple recipes are in here, from the famous Rice Crispies snacks to the easiest pot roast ever. Mr. Mclaughlin includes anecdotal comments that many readers will relate to. The reason I give it 4 stars is that all the photos in the book are in black and white. It could have been an outstanding presentation with color. But this does not take away from the great recipes. It's worth searching out the used books for this one."
1,Description missing crucial information,"I purchased this spin for studies in chiropractic school. The spine looks good and has all the right structures, but the great features end there. The description of this spine states that it is flexible. However, this is NOT the case. When I received the spine I noticed that it has a huge metal rod inserted through it. The rod allows for rotation but no lateral flexion, flexion, or extension of the spine. I put it directly into the box and contacted the sender to return it for a complete refund. This should not be labeled a chiropractic spine because it does not move how a real spine does and there is no way that I can visualize adjustments on it the way I need to as I learn this skill. Unless you're on the market for a 'pretty' spine to look at, this isn't the model for you."
1,Warped product and does not really protect!,"I've had this for over a year. It was very easy to install in my rabbit cage, but the screws are very long and sticks out about 0.75"" from the cage...not happy about that from a safety perspective with little kids. Also, one of the washer received had a warped center hole so I was not able to secure one end of the guard with the screw. I ended up securing that end with a twisty tie to the cage. The two guards do not line up correctly at the corner so there's a slight gap at the bottom where you need the protection the most since that's where the bunny goes potty! Also, the slant at the bottom is not slanted enough so their pee is still able to leak out of the cage from time to time and drip on your floor. I didn't want to fuss with the returns so I've been making do with it for now. :("
3,"Recycling is generally good, but not in literature.","This is a collection of short stories from the alternate history writer Harry Turtledove. He considers it a collection of stories that were not published in other works, but I found that all were recycled with the exception of the title story, which is actually two stories, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the collection. They each tell a different point of view in a universe where a man travels back through time to meet his younger self and save a marriage that his younger self doesn't even know exists, let alone that it was in trouble. The twin points of view were interesting, but they were the sole saving grace in a book that was dull otherwise. Think of a sawdust cake with delicious vanilla icing."
3,Mostly OK,"I found this collection a pretty mixed bag. I liked the idea of the title stories that bookended the collection, but didn't think it worked as well as it could have, as the closing story didn't add all that much to the beginning story. Better if it had spent more time showing how the results of what happened in the first story led to the changes in the character's life.Really, none of the stories really blew me away, but I was at least entertained by the alt-history stories. Out of the stories outside of that area, I probably most enjoyed ""Deconstruction Gang,"" but I work in higher ed, which may explain it.The Greek/Roman themed stories did very little for me. I will also admit to not reading the Videssos stories, as I've not read any of that series.Overall, it's worth a look, but keep your expectations in check."
1,You get what you pay for...This is a piece,"This is the 3rd one of these we have had in our van in the last barely 6 months. The 1st one had issues with skipping and the sound. The second one the sound went out within a week and the 3rd we had the longest and worked the best until last week. The sound goes out off and on randemly and we were on a trip back today get in our van to leave and nothing, it won't power up or do anything. We had a guy who worked for the dealership initally install it and he gave us a ""good deal"" or so we thought. He went out of bussiness 2 weeks later so we had been dealing with sound shop but they do not carry this product so they talk to the manufacturer and get us new ones for them to install but they are not really even wanting to do that anymore cause they have done it for us 2 x's now and they get nothing out of it.We are really in a bad position and not sure even what to do."
1,what a garbage!!,"since we bought it it never worked properly, majority of time black and white screen came on, today it jaust lays there, making us made every day as we ride our van, please do not buy this junk"
3,Very Tall,"The hat is very tall and adds elevation to my head. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you have a gigantic head. It is good quality, though."
2,Not a favorite,"My cats were excited about this toy at first, but now they rarely touch it. That's too bad, because it looks extremely durable. For some reason, the allure of this toy wears off pretty quickly. It's a little too big for them to carry around in their mouths, and I think that might be part of the problem."
5,Amazing toy!,"I knew this toy was going to be a hit before I even unwrapped the plastic packaging. One of my cats began going nuts trying to roll around in and about the small shipping box it had arrived in - probably the residual essence of the catnip.I can't wait for the other cats to wake from their naps so they can join in the fun - I will probably have to regulate how often they play with it so it doesn't get old.If your cat likes catnip and/or playing in plastic/paper bags, this is the toy for you! I ordered three as gifts, but will probably be ordering a few more for all the cat-lovers in my life!"
4,Nancy Drew,This is like music you would hear when you go into a new age store. I like to listen to before bedtime. I love the Lifescapes CDs very much and this was a good addition to my collection.
5,Wortld Flutes,"This is a very relaxing example of different flute types, It arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition,"
5,El mejor,"Este album contiene el tema que todos queremos escuchar cuando pensamos en Los Redonditos. Ese tema es JIJIJI. Ese solo tema merece comprar el disco, sin embargo, y como acostumbraron en toda su carrera, el disco tiene otros grandes temas y está lleno de guiños para lo que despues fueron ""las bandas"" y a esa altura todavia tomaban la leche."
5,Terrific Heist Classic,"""The Brinks Job"" isn't so much about an ingenious robbery. Truth be told anybody at the right place and time with pliers and a pair of tweezers could have pulled off ""the crime of the century"". It isn't so much that the caper was so ingenious but that the powers that were Brinks would allow themselves to be vulnerable to neighborhood mugs. Brinks' reputation was on par with that of General Motors, U.S. Steel, and Pan Am. That probably explains why the government invested 25 million dollars to a heist that netted 1.5 million dollars and were only able to recover $50,000.00. This is an eminently enthralling film. William Friedkin ably directs this yarn and is abetted with terrific period art direction by Dean Tavalouris. The top notch cast led by Peter Falk, Paul Sorvino, Peter Boyle, and Warren Oates is superb but it's really the story that drives this film. This film is truly a buried treasure and I'm glad Universal unleashed it from their vaults."
4,A Fairly Entertaining Film,"THE BRINK'S JOB is a suspenseful crime film inspired by the sensational Brink's robbery in Massachusetts after World War II. In some respects it is reminiscent of TOKAPI.Peter Falk heads an excellent cast which also includes Warren Oates, Peter Boyle, Alan Garfield, Paul Servino and Gena Rowlands. Warren Oates plays the part of the infamous Specs O'Keefe.THE DEER HUNTER dominated the Academy Awards competition in 1978. THE BRINK'S JOB failed to receive any nominations but it was still a fairly entertaining movie."
4,Goodtimes Home Video? Avoid this release!,"Goodtimes had a deal with Columbia, and later MCA/Universal to make cheap EP prints for sellthru while the two studios made SP quality versions for the rental market. Here's the link to the Wikipedia article that confirms I'm telling the truth. By the way, they recently finally went bankrupt.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoodTimes_Home_VideoThese are BAD prints. Go for the MCA/Universal soldin another listing. MUCH better print in quality SP mode.Good luck!"
