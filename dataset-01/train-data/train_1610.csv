4,Teach your child colors,"I bought this book for my eight month old as an introduction to colors. The colors are nice and bright. This book is intented for a preschooler. Some of the animals used to show color could have been named using their common names though. The author uses exact names like budgerigar, downy macaw, iguana, etc. I just feel like for an audience of much younger children it would be better to use names like bird and lizard. Thus the 4 stars and not 5. Good book overall. I would recommend it for parents with little children wanting to teach them color words."
3,Touch & Feel Animal Colors is intended for preschoolers,"IT IS FOR PRESCHOOLERS! Anyways, oops! I already said the important thing: It is for preschoolers. I mean, one of my sister's internet nickname is Chocolate Dog (my internet nickname is StoryMaker) and she wanted this. So, we bought it. OK, it is somewhat enjoyable, but it is for preschoolers as other reviewers mention. It is a simple word book with fuzzy or hard patterns on some pages. I like the bright colors and the patterns feel nice, but this was for youngsters. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
2,Not worth the money,"The dictionary works fine, but suffers from a lack of words, especially going from Japanese to English. To give one of many, many examples, it doesn't have Chuugoku (the word for ""China"") going from Japanese to English. It's totally unsuitable for a student studying Japanese. It might be OK for a tourist or someone living in Japan who doesn't intend to learn the language, except for one other problem: the price.I had hoped that this dictionary would have a stock of words similar to the Franklin dictionaries that I've used in the past for French and Spanish, but no go. This thing doesn't have anywhere near the range of those dictionaries."
3,"Good for Beginers, but overpriced","When I first bought this dictionary in Japan, it really helped me a lot because I couldn't read chinese characters. I would carry it with me wherever I went as it was really small and light. It helped me a lot in conversation because I could search for a word fairly quickly and it also was a big help in learning Kanji. But it didn't take long for me to realise that the vocabulary of the dictionary is VERY limited. This became much more apparent as I became better at Japanese. I wouldn't really recommend this dictionary to anyone simply because it's overpriced. I would recommend a dictionary for Japanese people (without Roman characters) because for the same price you can get a really good one especially the Casio Dictionaries."
3,Too few words,"If you are just starting to learn Japanese, then this is probably a good dictionary for you. If you have been studying it for awhile and are serious about the language, don't get this dictionary."
1,Not worth the money if a serious student,I would only recommend this dictionary to the occasional business traveler interested in using a few words but who has no intention of learning the Japanese language. A small paper dictionary would be just as effective at a fraction of the cost. [...]
4,Universal and specific,"I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on National Public Radio. She has an antagonistic attitude toward the regime, which, for reasons of its own, tolerates her. Duong expresses negativity toward Vietnamese communism mainly through her depiction of the narrator's uncle, a petty, dogmatic, narrow-minded cadre who brutalizes the narrator's angelic father. The preferability of capitalism is epitomized by the narrator's aunt, a wise, conscientious small landholder who overcomes adversity. The young female narrator would earn the sympathy of anybody under any system that shatters dreams and stifles opportunity. A good read, but be wary of the author's agenda."
4,"Full of atmosphere, with a taste of the sacred","a very good book, worth reading for anyone, but especially if you're interested in Vietnam, Vietnamese culture, communism, or southeast asian cuisine."
5,A thought provoking book.,This disturbing book describes how the communist regime in post war Vietnam trampled the hopes and dreams of the peasants it professed to serve. This book is beautifully written the descriptions of the land and the people are very poetic.
3,Vietnam under communist rule.,"This book gives a good picture of the atmosphere in the country: dictatorial power of corrupt party bosses, no free speech, hunger, inflation, collective suspicion, spying.It is well constructed: a mixture of flashbacks and actual facts.But I feel that the main characters are not integrated in the country's political and social system. There is a gap between the comments on the political and social environment and the experiences of the protagonists.To the bargain, the novel is full of family reunions with enumerations of long lists of dishes, what makes the reading sometimes boring.I prefer by far the work of Truong Nhu Tang 'A Vietcong Memoir'."
3,Great quality sizing not so good,"The costume arrived very fast and is very nice heavy quality material(polyester blends). After trying on the 4 pieces (dress, corset, apron, and belt) the costume looks more frumpy than sexy. The SM is to big for me and I am a size 6 everything is elastic except for the corset vest which is fully closed when laced up on me. I cannot get the costume tight enough for my liking. The apron is a full skirt that has thick elastic bunched waist which contributes to the more bulky appearance when wearing every piece. I would try to get a smaller size but there is no XS. I may end up wearing only the dress and the corset. You may want to go smaller than normal since everything is adjustable and a-line cut."
2,Not worth it,"This thing has two things going against it. First its a little too light steel which will burn some of your less liquid dishes (beans or chili), but is a non-issue for say stock. The other is that most pressure cookers ""high"" setting is 15psi, this one is 12psi. So if you are following tried and true recipes your going to have to add time, which is a dicey proposition for a pot you can't look into while cooking.All that said I'm giving it 2 stars just because I've never seen a perfect pressure cooker."
2,Not worth the price.,The cooker is rather low quality especially for the price. The thickness of the steel is much more befitting to the $20 pots at walmart. This thing has no heft at all even with the lid. Disappointing.
4,The Shuttlecock of the Gods,"Don't let my jokey title fool you--I thought "" A Feasibility Study"" is an interesting entry from the original OUTER LIMITS series. However, the Luminiod vehicle that abducts the six square blocks looked like a reject from Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE. What did they use? A bronzed shuttlecock?And three cheers for Phyllis Love! This was one of her more notable TV appearances, which included turns on THE TWILIGHT ZONE, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, PERRY MASON, GUNSMOKE and several others. With ""girl-next-door"" innocent prettiness, Love was perfect for the Sci-Fi genere with wide, expressive, almost-other worldly eyes."
4,A good one.,"People on a six-block area are transported to another planet to become slaves for an alien race. Good acting, and the haze-like effect over the neighborhood creates a gloomy atmosphere that makes it feel as if they really are on another world. One of the better episodes of this series."
4,A very good build but its a brick.,"Ah the MSN-04 Sazabi.. Perhaps my favorite MS of my favorite Gundam Character. Since there isn't a Version Katoki release yet I got this fully aware it is a brick mostly.My thoughts on the proportions is that this model captured the anime design mostly except the thigh armor could use a little touching up and smaller.The colors I like but could be better as it is a 2 tone red.Build is very very straight forward and easy.Articulation is very limited in the legs due to how this kit was designed in the frame and its thigh armor.No Stand for the funnels or action pieces but that is expected due to the age of this kit. It is over 10 years old.Overall, I would recommend this to people who love the suit and the character who pilots it. Though for people looking for insane articulation i wouldn't because of the legs, proportions, and the bright red that is one of the tones of red."
5,Good Quality and Great Price,"I bought this vest for my daughter's Sweet 16 formal party escort. The vest matched her dress perfectly and my daughter and her escort looked very elegant and formal. I like the formal look of the vest, and it stands alone without a jacket. The burgundy vest has a different adjuster in the back than the navy blue vest. It's a somewhat different vest, but no one will notice the subtle differences. I gave the blue vest a rating of 4 stars and I give this one a 5 because of the much better adjuster on the back of the vest. I highly recommend this seller and this vest. I believe that this is a great seller to do business with."
5,Men's Dress Vest NeckTie BURGUNDY Neck Tie Set for Suit or Tuxedo 4XL,What a simple way to change up a Tuxedo for varying looks. I go on sea cruises quite often and now wear Tuxedos for the big dinner night. This unit allows me to significantly vary the look without the cost. My wife and I added some spandex in the back too allow for expansion and many years of use.
1,Don't bother,The problems presented in this study guide are not as difficult as the ones you'll do on the math content knowledge test. For a practice test I'd just use the free one provided by the ets website rather than waste money on this book.
1,Not worth the money,Definitely not worth the money. The TAAG available on the ETS website as well as the free test content information is just as good as this book. The real test is much harder than the practice test.
1,Great idea - terrible execution,"The idea of the structure of this book is great: teach visual basic by having the reader perform tasks. Each task is small enough that it can be described in 7 or less steps (2 pages). Illustrate the steps of the tasks with screen shots.However, the execution of the book is bad to poor. Many times the tasks are not tasks but just information presented as tasks. There are many editorial errors (spelling errors, inconsistencies between text and screen shots, inconsistencies between steps in a task) that make it hard to execute the tasks (I guess you could argue that teachs you debugging...). Maybe future editions of the book will be cleaned up."
1,How to Use Visual Basic 6,"This book has lovely graphics, but is hard to read and follow. The examples in the text are in extremely small type and difficult to decipher. The subject index is limited, and the topics are covered in only a brief and cursory manner. The book seems to have sacrificed content for graphics.There are much better books available, even for beginners, such as Peter Norton's Guide to VB6, Mastering VB6, and VB6 the Black Book."
3,"If you dig Randy Brecker and/or Bill Evans, by all means buy it!","Hey how can you go wrong on a recent live double! CD set by Randy & Bill? And with a rhythm section featuring the steady bass of Victor Bailey, imaginative keyboard contributions by Dave Kikoski, and the always-exciting Steve Smith?Well it's a mixed bag. I would have hesitated if I also noted that Hiram Bullock was on it. Not because of his guitar work...no, it's fine and on a par with the other musicians.But remembering this guy from his appearances with the David Sanborn band, back during Sanborn's late night TV shows - he was always a LOOK AT ME! kinda musician. And this release is messed-up with his vocals aimed at the overseas toe-tappers (17 of the 18 venues were in Europe)."
5,WOW!,"This card is amazing. The abiltiy to retract the antenna is a huge plus. A corection to another review I read - Card will not work while retracted!. The reception is excellent. I needed to replace a USR2410 due to VERY poor signal strength. I ordered linksys card (not the new 54g) since I have the Linksys WAP. Even worse signal strength than the 2410. Returned it and ordered the 3com card, with much hesitation considering my problem with the USR. Signal strength is at full where other two cards could not even connect. Amazing!! I would highly recommend this product."
2,Keeps dropping the connection,"When I first bought this XJack card, I thought that it was a great idea; I could collapse it so that I wouldn't have to eject the card when putting my laptop away. However, I have used it in several different environments with several different APs and it will drop the connection every once and awhile.Right now I'm sitting about 80 feet away from the access point and have the speed turned down to 1Mbps and it still drops the connection every couple of minutes. The signal strength seems to very a lot from Very Low to Good when the laptop is just sitting stationary.Anyways, I hope this helps you make a smarter purchase."
3,Until Amazon removes them...,"Readers should note that the two reviews below dated 1999 and 1998 are for Yockey's 1992 book, not this 2005 one. Once Amazon deletes those reviews, Amazon can delete this one as well."
4,Album of fluid motion,This is a great book for all instructors teaching fluid mechanics or CFD. My students were really excited on seeing those beautiful pictures. This book can be an excellent incentive for the CFD students to simulate those flows.
4,"Quality, Cost Effective Safety Sunglasses","If you're looking for an inexpensive but durable Z87 approved set of safety glasses that offer UV protection and polarized lenses, these will work quite well. They look like regular old sunglasses but the impact resistant lenses meet OSHA standards for safety glasses and they keep your eyes from becoming too stressed when working in the sun.Good quality, great price, and performance as good as my expensive (non safety lens) sunglasses."
4,Great back up pair,"These are great back up pair, and good driving glasses, I have a fat head and they are tight on my head but comfortable. GREAT BACK UP PAIR, and great price for every day use, and if you lose them no a huge deal. They take a good beating, and shade is good in bright light , and Ok in dim lighting."
5,Read alot....,"Excellent book, if you have the chance to read the wholeseries, such as Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The legacy, Starless Nights,Passage to Dawn, The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, The Halflings Gem,and Siege of Darkness, this is the most exciting of the series. It has excellentturning points of Drizzt's life in the Underdark, living as a hunter...And his feelingsand lonliness.....His feelings are truly brought out in this book. View my home pageon Drizzt Do'Urden, you'll see Drizzt as never before...http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/218"
4,Meet the Hunter,"""Exile"" takes place a few years after ""Homeland"". Drizzt has escaped the terrible world of the Dark Elves to find a life of his own.He is trapped in the endless tunnels of the Underdark, where you Hunt, or be hunted. This terrible world has made Drizzt into what Salvatore calls ""The Hunter"".It is in ""Exile"" that we meet a much different Drizzt. One that is vicious and takes no mercy. That is until he meets some unlikely friends.This is a great book, but more of just a small tie together book for the first and third great installments of the trillogy. Not as good as the others."
5,truly a masterpiece,"I read this book about a year or so ago and the memory of it still burns brightly in my mind. From the cunning layout of the plot to the kind of obvious but breathtaking end this book has kept me wishing for more every time I finish a chapter. The cataclysmic struggle between Drizzt`s conscience and the dark primal instinct of the hunter rivals even the most famous books ever written throughout all time. In my opinion, this should be made either a video game or a movie, it would excell at both.I salute you Salvatore! To many more books of the life that has captured so many in its thrall."
4,"Legend of Drizzt, Book II",My son suggested these books and I am glad he did. Very interesting and keeps your attention. Have suggested these books to others and they enjoyed them as well.
4,second book in the series.,great read. Drizzt is on his way to being all he can be. I have to go on to the next book asap.
2,Hard to keep up with,I was lost during most of this book I wish I could say more but as I said was lost
4,"Very Good, but not as good as Homeland",I really enjoyed reading this second enstallment of the Dark Elf Trilogy. The journey of Drizzt throught the Underdark was very creatively written and I really enjoyed it. The only thing I really found a little annoying was Clacker. I really didn't see a purpose to that character. Belwar and the deep gnomes however helped the book greatly. I was satified with this book and couldn't wait to get to Sojourn.
5,Awild joyride like nothing I've read before,Wow I've read this book dozens of times the first time I read it in 9 hours after working a nine hour night shift I just could'nt put it down I was so exhausted but sleep just would'nt come my mind was racing I've read them all and without a dout this was the best
5,Great Gift!,Bought this for my son who loves to read on a lot of different subjects but he loves fantasy the most.
3,Fun in the Underdark with Drizzt,"If you liked the &#65533;Homeland,&#65533; then get ready for more fun with Drizzt and the Underdark! Our intreprid hero and his feline sidekick travel the gloomy tunnels of the underground world in exile from the cruel society of the Dark Elves. His family desires to find him so they may regain the favor of Lolth the Spider Queen, and raise up a zombie of Drizzt&#65533;s father to bring him back. Drizzt meanwhile finds companionship with a dwarf and rock burrowing creature who has been transformed by a curse into a hook horror. The three companions stumble on a mind flayer cavern, a pack of dire cobies, an evil wizard...well, you get the idea. The finale sets us up for even greater vistas of adventure. This is an altogether enjoyable light fantasy novel, but it does occasionally drag under overlong battle sequences. Drizzt still keeps your interest, and his conflict with his undead father plays out perfectly."
1,Pointless,"One star is too much for this book. It is no where near as interesting as Homeland. The plot is linear, predictable and trite.Drizzt's new friends in this book are weakly developed leaving the reading feeling very undetached from the entire story. I would have tossed this book in the garbage a 1/4 of the way through but I was unfortunatly stuck on a plane with nothing else to do."
4,Good followup to the first book of the trilogy,"Again, another fast-paced, straightforward tale with a lot of action and excitement as Drizz't is exiled from Menzoberranzen and must survive on his own in the Underdark. Great characters in the book and a nice climactic Star Wars like ending to the story with the spirit wraith. Again, not too complex without a lot of surprises, but a fun read."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Dark Elf Trilogy-Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the Underdark Drow city of Menzoberranzan in the World of Faerun. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Duty, honor, bravery, magic, and swordfights are all about. A great trilogy indeed and a ""must read"" along with RA Salvatore's The Icewind Dale Trilogy!"
5,A magical and great read,"An amazing book, it offers a ample amount of magic and savage fantasy with just enough darkness to punctuate the savage world of the drow and the murderous intents of the surrounding creatures."
4,Good read!,"I've already reviewed the first book, so I might as well review the second. It was almost as good as the first, but still deserving of four stars. I missed the interaction with the other drow, and really hope in future books there are some conclusions to what happened to all of them. I gave it four stars because 5 is genius level and I've only come across a couple of those. I really hope my daughter will one day read this book, and we can talk about it together."
2,"Performed well but leaked, manufacturer not responsive","Had high hopes for these, as many people on VTXOA forum praised them (and the 412s). Easy install, bike performed much better, especially two-up. Unfortunately, one started leaking after a year or so so put back the stock shocks. Tried to contact manufacturer for warrantee repair thru website and by separate email, never got a response. Says lifetime warrantee, which is why I bought them over the 412s, but will not buy anything Progressive again."
1,Horrible,"Gave me Horrible Heartburn, felt like I was having a heart attack every day I took it. Not for me. Beware if you suffer from GERD."
5,Excellent product,This product came highly recommended by a friend and it deserves 5 stars. Follow the directions and you will agree.
5,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome ""C"" not as bad.....","I have a very difficult digestive system. I'm 40, and started having the C symptoms of IBS 20 years ago. It's up and down - never the same. I could be very regular (for me that's 4-5 days per week) for months, then it gets backed up. Starting 3 months ago, I was becoming very constipated. I started the Swiss Kriss on Jan 1st (it's the end of Feb now) and it's so far totally working. I do get a little crampy from it, but with IBS that is the story of my life. I personally only need 2 tablets with LOTS of water before bed about 3 days a week. In between, I might take just one. THIS SAVED ME!!! I'm just hoping soon that I'll have the luxury of not needing it as much. I've taken a couple of 5 day breaks - and although I find I can't go as well, I still can sort of go...."
4,NOT from China - Good Product,"I checked with mfr - the materials to make the tablets come from Germany and India - not China - if you are interested in that sort of thing.I think straight senna tablets is a better idea after using this product. But, it is good."
5,Best for Constipation!,"I have suffered from constipation for years since having my second child, this product has helped me wonderfully! No stomach cramps or the sensation to vomit that I have gotten with other laxatives on the market!"
3,Works okay,"Pros: definitely works on me with 2 tabletsCons: major cramps, so I can't really take 2 tablets. If I take one tablet, it doesn't seem to work well. The teas work better for me."
2,Returned to my original choice.,Previously I always used Puritan Pride Herbal Laxative and decided to go back to that brand. It agrees with me much more.
4,Does the job,Works fine. Don't know much about the natural ingredients used. If you have a sensitive digestive system one may want to double check ingredients.
5,Great product.,I love this product. It is not too harsh but it is the only product I have found that works for me.
2,Does not work well,First time I tried it two didn't work second time tried five and finally worked but gave severe terrible cramping took more that 12 hours to work and only produced a small painful bowel movement
1,where is my order?,Where is my order please? I am so disappointed about your services. I want my money back. Pissed off a
4,good book,This book was my least favorate of the rock creek six but still a good read. The friendship that has developed between these six men is very heartwarming.
5,Beautiful touching poems,"Leonard Nimoy is an honest man, of deep feeling. You can read touching poems in this book by this warm-hearted actor. You can see that love is a very important thing in his life and he takes it seriously. I recommend everybody this poetry book with all my heart."
2,Very outdated!!!,"First, FIX THE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION AMAZON!!!!!In spite of Loopy's warning I ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as ""teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin."" My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip.If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars. But considering the age I would recommend you pass and search for other sources."
3,Reprinted not updated,"I ordered both the East and West Books by Holt. The copyright was 1995 and 1996. I called Lyons Press and these are the most recent books available. Lyons Press just reprinted them in 2002, but nothing was updated or rewritten from the original books. So beware, the content is 10+ years old, even though the covers are 2002 vintage."
2,Publication date wrong,"I just got this book and have not begun to read it but the first thing I noticed was that the copywrite date is way off. The book I got was published in 1995, but the web site says 2002. A lot can change in 10 years. I am debating as to whether to return it and get a newer book."
2,"Too much complaining, not enough fishing!","I was so excited about having a book that broke down each area and what you will find in each lake, stream or river and what to use. What I found was a lot of bellyaching about logging, guns and noisy teenagers. Obviously this is someone who has a different agenda than just giving good fishing advice. If you own a home near water, have a barbed wire fence, have a gun or a teenager, own a boat with a motor or fish other than fly fishing etc. etc.... BEWARE! This spews liberal propaganda and ruined a perfectly good concept of a book."
4,fantastic Montana fly fishing guide book,You really can't go wrong with this book. It is invaluable and the information is original and entertaining.My only negative is I would have liked the option of buying a more epxensive book with full color photos and more scenery shots of each river.
2,Not easy to understand,I do not find this book easy to read and understand. It jumps from topic to topic then back again to a previous topic. I have a medical background and book is difficult for me to follow.
2,More a Collection of Short Stories Than A Novel,"Andrew Mueller, Australian journalist covers everything from rock shows by U2 and The Cure, interviewing a young Green Day, Tobogganning in the French Alps, coming face-to-face with the Taliban and witnessing the unrest in the Balkans in the early 1990's to name but a few. Here he shares his adventures with each tale a short story in itself with nothing to connect them. The writing is good and humorous and the author rather likeable. The problem with this book is that I found some parts interesting and others dull and uneventful. The spectrum covered is rather wide and lacks consistency. On the plus side, you can pick it up at a whim, choose a chapter and not worry about the previous one as it has no bearing on the one that you are reading. It's not a bad book but not a particularly good one either."
2,Great if consider expensive gourmet,"A great gourmet cookbook but by no means reflects the title ""... Real Kitchen"" I'm a 30 something dad looking to improve the quality of our everyday family meals. The title and all the great reviews drew me in! - Tyler must have lots of friends :)If you think that a single recipe comprised of ""Salmon Gravlax"", ""Buckwheat Blini"", and ""Dill Creme Fraiche"" is appropriate for a ""real kitchen"" cookbook than this is the book for you !I need high quality practical recipes that can be prepared in short order - not, ""Clambake"" with lobsters, kielbasa, clams and oysters!I firmly believe that the readers and the publisher would be better served if this were re-marketed as a ""Gourmet Cookbook""."
4,a great cookbook,"I received my copy in the afternoon and by that night I had already made one of the recipes. I was a fan of the author from the tv show Food 911 and used many of his recipes from that show, so buying this book was a no brainer. I can't wait to try out the rest of these recipes in this book. I would recommend this cookbook. The book is nicely done, and has a good introduction about what essential cooking supplies one needs."
2,Reluctant to Try Another Recipe,"I really enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network, and the other recipes of his that I've tried from the Food Network website have turned out well. However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding. Thus, I'm wary of trying another recipe in the book, but if I do, I'll be a lot less blindly trusting."
1,Not at all what I thought it would be!,I bought the book thinking it would be more of a common food cookbook. I was wrong. Some of the recipes used hard to find items. I was disappointed. The book is already for sale on ebay.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"My sister and I absolutely ADORE our hottie, Tyler Florence. But, when I bought this book, I realized it wasn't at all like his great show. Many recipes contained hard-to-find ingredients and were too difficult to make. With kids, I would never make more than half of the recipes in the book. I was really disappointed, but won't stop watching his show. We still love him and will look forward to trying his new book coming out next year."
2,Overpriced junk,Works perfectly - just like my $3 generic audio cables. Don't pay extra for Monster's marketing.
4,Good work out small size,"This is a very small and won't take up a lot of room. The tension in the steps is pretty good. The arm bands are not adjustable but are rather stiff. I haven't had this device long enough to comment on the sturdiness. However, it seems to be well made. I think it was worth the price."
2,Junk,"The first day I had this product, I used it for about 20 min. when I had to stop due to the smell of burning rubber. This is the smell of the internal seals of the pneumatic tubes beginning to melt. The device simply cannot withstand 20 minutes of use due to heating of the tubes. After that I kept my workouts to only 15 minutes. This is not enough for a cardio workout, but as part of bigger routine it's ok. After 2 weeks of using it 2-3 times each week for 15 minutes, the step counter/timer broke. So I began timing my workout with the clock. Now after less than 3 months of use, the cable is so stretched out and the resistance so low that it is ready for the dumpster. I weight 155 lbs, so I'm well below the maximum weight for this unit. Denise should be ashamed of herself!"
2,Works OK...but not nearly as well as hoped,"I ordered this to replace a similar version made by Sharper Image that I used to own, but this bears little resemblance other than the motion of stepping up and down. The tension control continuously needs tightening, which disrupts my ""workout"". As well, if you want some serious stepping action, this just doesn't offer enough resistance...no matter how much you tighten the knob. This is probably best suited for someone who only wants light aerobic exercise and doesn't like a hard and heavy workout, who also doesn't mind stopping every 5 to 10 minutes to adjust the knob...being careful not to touch the assembly underneath that gets hot from use. Wouldn't buy again, but can't afford to replace it and it's to heavy to return, so I'm keeping it."
4,Love this Little Stepper,"I've had this thing for a couple of weeks now, and i really like it. It seems really well made. I I really like the adjustable tension.The arm bands are kind of hard for me to use right now, but maybe in time.the only complaint: the hidraulycs start to make noise after I've been on it for about 30 min."
1,Too hard to use,"I have never been able to adjust the tension on this product or maybe that's the way it is supposed to be; however it takes all my weight just to push down on the pedal to get it started. Then it is so hard to keep going, never mind using the arm toners. I thought I would get used to it and tried it every day for two weeks, but it was just TOO HARD to use. My husband tried adjusting the tension also and it couldn't get it to loosen up either. I feel like this was a really big waste of money!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The product arrived with no instructions so I've never been able to use the meter. It makes a squawking sound so loud you can't hear music even with headphones and sound turned to full volume. You can't adjust the tension and the arm cables popped out. It left black stains, perhaps graphite, on the carpet which won't come out. Only positive comment - it's small!"
2,poor durability on steel cable,"same as other users.steel cable is broken.the entire units construction looks strong, but after the cable snapped it's useless.my wife was happy when worked. but it only last for about 4 weeks.I'll try to contact vendor or factory to get a cable replacement.I would recommend to others, only if they want this item for 4 weeks.poor construction on cable only."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This thing has never worked for me. I would not waste time and money on purchasing this.
2,Don't Buy This Monitor!,"I bought this monitor about three months ago and the first time I used it I noticed that the sides of the display where curved inward way too much, and no matter what I did with the OSD the sides of the display where either curved inward or outward way too much. Then about three days later I started having another problem with the monitor.... on the left side of the screen there would be a wave pattern every now and then, which would be enough to give you a headache and make you dizzy. I thought I would give CTX a chance because I heard a few good things about them.... boy did I make a mistake! It's back to NEC Multisync Diamondtron's and Sony Trinitrons only for me. Maybe I just got a bad one though, but I still don't recommend buying this monitor... why even take the chance. I'm returning this one before I start having more problems with it!"
3,Starting a Bunco club,"Things in this case are okay, I feel that the bell is not large enough, the Bunco dice that you throw around the room to whom ever buncos needs to be larger. and the printing on the score sheets need to be larger along with more of them."
5,Love my new Bunko game,"My old bunko game disappeared when I moved so I was looking to get a new one. The old one was in a cardboard box and since we pass it around from person to person depending on who is hosting Bunko, it was getting a little beat up anyway.Because this is in a metal tin, it will be more durable and travel a lot easier - and it's nice and compact, which I like also.Dice are also easy to ready - the pink ones from my old game were harder to read for some reason.The pouch is also good quality."
2,Mini Version ??,Purchased this game for a Bunco league we were starting in our neighborhood. When I opened the box I was surprised how small the tin was and basically the same about the contents inside. It is a mini version the traveling bunco die and bell were tiny! I returned it for a grown-up version :)!
1,Compatibility Can Be A Problem!,"Although the manufacturer's website and documentation enclosed with the product claims it is compatible with Dell Notebooks and all Texas Instruments Cardbus Controllers, it turned out that it was NOT compatible with a Dell Inspiron 700m with a Texas Instruments Cardbus Controller. Buyer Beware!"
5,Good PCI docking solution,"I bought this docking device because it provides a good solution to add an external monitor with high resolution (up to 1600x1200) and other devices such as USB and printer. The device has an external VGA card with 8MB memory. So it allows you to continue using your laptop's VGA port in addition to the VGA card in the dock. This means you can connect to external monitors to your laptop. However, I have not been able to configure the device for 8:5 monitors.Contrary to the experience of the previous reviewer, I was able to set up the device with my Dell Inspiron 600m. I had to download some drivers, however, and restart my computer each time I installed a driver."
5,Somewhat difficult to read but well worth the effort,"Being that this is an academic book, it is not surprising that the writing style is rather dry. Of course, since this book was translated from the Finnish, that could account for a certain awkwardness in phrasing here and there.That being said, the book gives a well-researched and detailed account of homosexuality from ancient Mesopotamia to the modern world. The writer shows that homosexuality was not only condoned in many ancient cultures, but fully integrated into the social structure. And while the author fails to draw any conclusion (this being an academic work, I believe Nissinen thought it best to just put the facts out there and let the reader decide), it is well worth reading and I think an important contribution to the literature on GLBT studies."
2,"Really cute, BUT...","I love the look of this shoe.. it's adorable, sporty, cute and cool all at the same time. However, there is one MAJOR flaw with this shoe. The back part is SO high that it tortures the back of your ankle. It's just so painful with the back section is too high, as it is with this shoe. Otherwise, it's great. Perhaps if one could use an insole or something like that.. but for me, it was just not working."
5,lady comp celsius,"It arrived before than expectedAnd it really usefulIt was new as promised, so I'm pleased"
3,I loved it until it broke.,"I really loved this until I took it on a plane and it broke. I only had it for about 2 years at the time so it couldn't be the battery. For the price, I was pretty upset about it. I was able to figure out my cycle still and be effective til we were ready to have a baby."
2,Lady Comp battery,I have had and used the Lady Comp for a couple of yeas. It did help us for a couple of months avoid a pregnancy due to health issues. However it failed to recognize my tubal pregnancy which was getting far along and I was rushed into surgery. Also the battery no longer holds a charge and customer service has yet to help me on this issue. My friends use other monitors that are less expensive $20 and work just as well.
5,Incredible device!,"When I first heard about Lady Comp from a friend, I was very skeptical. It sounded too good to be true. After 6 months of use...it IS too good to be true!!No weight gain, no high blood pressure, no joint pain, no mood swings, no ANYTHING (including sudden death) related to BC pills and the many hormone alternatives.If you love your body, you shouldn't think twice about getting this product.""What are the CONS""? you may ask!Well, in the beginning it is a bit tricky to set up, and you have to take your temperature at approximately the same time each morning for it to show you your daily readings correctly...hmm and you can't have unsafe sex for a couple of days out of the month when you are ovulating.THATS ALL!!!GET THIS PRODUCT and you are going to fall in love with it!!!"
5,worth the investment,This product works great!! It takes about a month to learn your cycle but was right on with an ovulation test I used. No side effects and is a lot cheaper than years of birth control pills. I highly recommend it.
5,Solving the technology puzzle for the dummy!,"I really enjoyed this book! And that is a real surprise to me. I read it for the information and expected it to give me that. But, it is so well written that not only could I understand it but I also found it to be enjoyable reading and even humorous at times too. It was very easy for this ""dummy"" to understand. I loved it!"
1,Compendium of our trade,"I really did not like this book. In fact I quit reading it at page 144. I really wanted to know something about the migration of (soft- and hardware) systems and the possibilities to deal with the many accompanying problems.What I got was a loose assortment of information we could read over the past decades in our trade magazines. Besides the misleading title, I also could not find an added value in the contents: no special selection or special assessments of the topics. Just contents thrown at the reader.Even many figures were just copied. What was obviously before in color is now in a blurred gray style. With the consequence that some legends can not be properly mapped to the figure elements.I do still consider upgrades and migrations an important topic and would be thankful for a good book on it."
2,Not that great,I was very disappointed with this novel. This isn't dorothy eden's best work. There is not much romance or connection between the guy and the girl and the mystery is not so startling.
3,for a rainy day,This is an ok gothic type romance. I'd save it for when you have absolutely nothing else to read and MUST read something. I think middle school girls would like it better than adult women. It's a little predictable.
3,Good story; memorable images,"This story has a marvelous set-up and a brilliant ending. I recommend it, and look forward to Villasenor's next effort.Four minor quibbles: 1. Because Villasenor is more a stylist than a storyteller, problems arise when he strays from the latter altogether. So when the story slows in the middle, the reader is left with the arid space of style for style's sake. 2. The author is overfond of the word ""splayed."" 3. The stylistic choice to not use quotes sometimes means a brilliant, seamless expression of thought. Sometimes it falls flat and only means more work for the reader. 4. Zach's ""making lists"" exercise is not concluded satisfactorily."
2,VERY Basic info,"This book would be good for someone just starting out in the miniature ""world."" Most experienced collectors figured these things out as a child. Great book for a child! Or, if you're just starting out, you need this to get very basic information."
3,Should have been graded 6th grade level,"Upon receiving the book, I was disappointed. One, I paid too much for it, two, it was on the level of a child. True I am an immature, but even I was able to create the furniture shown ""when"" I was a child. Alas, we live and learn."
4,"Good Instructions, But Poor Photographs. Basic Projects, Fun For Most Miniature Crafters. A Good Book.","If you're looking for something to guide you through the basic steps of sewing a bedspread, mini quilt, 1:12 scale pillows, etc., this book will be a great help. If you are one who is very much into seeing color photos of the finished projects, you may be disappointed. This book definitely lacked in the picture department. There were so few pictures and I think instructional books ought to illustrate the steps of each project, not just the overall finished piece. Anyway, I would rate this one as good, but I can't say great. Also, it's a bit dated for my taste. You can sort of tell it's an older book just by looking at the cover. It would be nice if this book was re-published in a revised edition."
4,"pretty good, thanks","There were some pages which were REALLY highlighted and then there were some that were not at all. And they told me it was used-good, so I'd say that fits the description well. They also sent it to me very quickly. Thanks very much!"
4,"TV's Best Dramatic Series, but new 'score' rings false","St. Elsewhere has always been my favorite television series. This set is a fine representation of its humor, emotional depth and exemplary ensemble of actors. The writers should be given especial credit for the show's success, as well. Unfortunately, the last two tapes in collection contain 'new' overdubbed music for some scenes. For example, during the 'Time Heals' 50-year retrospective episode, Edward Herrmann (Fr. Joseph McCabe) is supposed to be dancing to 'Ain't Misbehavin' piped through the address system. Instead, the viewer must endure an awful, static-filled muzak version of a 30s song. It would seem that rights were too expensive to secure the popular music which was used so effectively in the broadcast version. The aria in the penultimate scene of the final episode is also sorely missed. These are great disappointments in an otherwise superlative collection."
1,The very best of saint elsewhere,"I Love Saint Elsewhere and we were tickled to finally get this video, although a DVD with all the series would be better."
5,Hawaiian Red Sea Salt (alaea),"This salt's grain is pretty large for table use, but has a really nice flavor and attractive color. I have recommended this to my friends who need to watch their salt intake because you can ""see"" just how much salt you are using."
3,Love sea food,"I love sea food. I used `Hawaiian Red Sea Salt' for cooking those foods. Then I want to get a sea salt which can be perfect for all kinds of foods. I found this tasty salt in Amazon. It looks fresh and it is not mixed with chemical. So, the minerals and nutritious value is high in it. So, I choose this for my daily cooking. You will be surprised after getting its good taste in your food.Sayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSalt"
1,Very Self-Serving Natural Law,"The article clearly must propound the typical Catholic view of Natural Law if it is published in Catholic University's Review of Metaphysics. One can only marvel at the trajectory of researcher like Mr. Sirico, having been gay activist, and apparently involved in the sleazy end of things (see several online articles) and now he is an avatar of libertarianism and laissez faire for everyone except his own kind, gay people. Articles like this will be a marvel of the fatuousness in context of this ancient tradition of Natural Law used to shill for the most reactionary sentiments today."
2,Imagine that...,A book all about our ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE CELEBRITIES that lets us feel morally superior! I can't wait for the movie!
3,Should Include a Disclaimer...,"Cintra is my favorite columnist in Salon magazine, and I was really looking forward to this book. I was disappointed, however, to discover that most of the book consists of material that has already appeared in Salon (and can still be read by accessing her archived columns). Although I don't regret buying the book, I'm a little surprised that it doesn't include a disclaimer that it ""contains previously published material"" or something to that effect."
5,"Truthful, Wonderful, & Sad.","It is embarassing how seriously Americans take the culture of celebrity and the media. One of the many reasons we are the world laughing stock. This book is finny, sad and an oh so improtant look at ourselves as Americans and as people. I am a grubby little nobody unfamous person, so I guess this reviwew won't get read anyway."
2,Seen It All Before,"I'm a big fan of the author, but I was disappointed with this book.First, several of the pieces have previously appeared in her old Salon column. Her fans are always hungry for new material. Second, there was a lack of integration in the sections. The pieces stood alone well enough, but lacked cohesion despite some repetition. Finally, there was no conclusion offered on the inane search for fame. I would also have liked the 'hipper than thou' Cintra to have been more introspective.Having said that, the author's characteristic turn of a phrase is amply displayed. Her use and creation of an adjectives always make me smile."
2,Not bright enough,Very disappointing brightness. Starts bright then light immediately fades. I changed the batteries but that did not help. Steer clear of this light.
4,Great light,"this light is just as described. it is lite in turns of weight. shines bright and easy to mount. and it also can stand on its own. we have used it as light for kindle, table light, and clip on light."
3,It works okay,"This light has a nice tight clip and a strong, long, bendable neck. As far as the lighting goes, do not expect to get the feeling you just turned on the lights so you can see the page. This light is focused. It says that it covers a wide area, but it does not. It lights up half of a page of music and the rest of the page is quite dull. LED light is a funny thing, because you turn it on and it barely seems to be noticeably on. But, direct to your page and it brightens at least the small area that it can quite well, without eyestrain. I have no experience with more expensive models. They are all LED..so, I can't imagination truly getting much more bang for the buck, but for $8.00 it will suffice and be a nice addition to another light if need be in the future."
4,Good book light,"This works well, and is pretty bright. I have no problems reading with this in a dark room. It clips easily onto a book and is easy to manipulate. I haven't used one of these before so I can't compare it to others, but I like this product."
5,Great little light!,"This light is fairly bright and provides more than enough for reading. My wife uses it in bed when I'm sleeping and I don't notice a thing. However, I am a stomach sleeper so my face typically will not be directed towards the light."
2,Too bright for my needs...,"This seems like a nice little light, but it is too bright for my needs (reading in bed). It's light weight, and takes 3 AAA batteries (not included).Update 4/12/12After having used this for a while I have to take a star off. Now when I turn it on, it is blinding, then quickly dims itself to the point of being almost useless. Its a weird, cheap finicky little light, and I absolutely cannot recommend."
4,Great light,"This book light clips onto the page well and but comes off easily enough. Very bright in a dark room, lights up an area wide enough that you do not have to move it to read the far side of the other page. Neck stays in place well. No complaints, I would buy it again."
3,"Good lighting, way too heavy and bulky for thinner or smaller books","Ok so I really want to like this thing. Its really bright, has an awesome moveable neck and all, but the clip on base is very heavy and bulky for books that are thin like graphic novel size. I bought it so I can read my graphic novels at night, but attaching it onto the back it bends forward from the weight and puts a crease where it was attached. I ended up having to attach it to my finger while I read just to enjoy my graphic novel without ruining it. I would suggest something smaller, I will be looking on Amazon for such a light."
2,Let there be more light,"This does not light up the page very well. It is handy, but you still need a lamp in the room in order to see. Not worth the price."
5,"Finally, a quality product!","I used to have a cheap reading light that worked horribly. This one is great. It has a bulky base but the clip side is very slender and doesn't interfere with the pages of the book I'm reading. It clips nice and soundly to hardcovers, and the clip can even be inserted into the spine area on a lot of books. The reticulating ""shaft"" is easily manipulated and stays put in the desired position. The light is VERY bright, so bright, in fact, that I had to put two layers of masking tape over it to dim it. Unlike my previous light, this one shines on the pages and not in your eyes. It also illuminates all of both pages being read; not just a small spot like other lights. I've had the light for almost two months now and it has been used almost every night without a problem. My wife has even taken to using it quite a bit so I might end up having to get her one as well."
1,Didn't last long...,"I was thrilled with this light when I first got it, it was much brighter than my other book lights. But even as I used it on the first day, it suddenly got much dimmer. I shook it, and it got bright again, and then got dimmer again. I had to return it."
5,Cheap imitation received from non-Amazon seller,The light we received was NOT what we ordered.The cheap imitation we received in the mail today gets 1-star.Be sure to order product that is shipped direct from Amazon if you want to receive what you ordered. I don't know how they get away with it but somehow the secondary sellers have access to the ordering process and they DO NOT always ship the advertised product. The product's good reputation is being tainted by this unethical practice. Big League Solutions and The Guide both based in Alpharetta GA do not ship Fulcrum book lights. Their price is good but it is NOT the Fulcrum book light. Beware.
1,Don't waste your money,"We have alot of power failures and reading with a flashlight was no longer cutting it. After looking at several book lights and reading many of the reviews here I decided to try this one. I tried it out and it is impossible to read even 1 paragraph with this light.The light is so dim! And the switch is faulty,the slightest movement of the book or page and the switch gets jiggled and turns off.It's only redeeming quality is that it takes regular batteries. This light is not worth spending your money on!This is a waste!I am going back to the flashlight!"
1,Fulcrum Multi Flex LED Task Light,On and Off switch broke in less than a month. Still works but I couldn't get the switch to stick back on.
3,Not Bad.,"Shipping was quick, nothing was damaged. It's not as bright as I thought it was be, even in the pitch dark. On the other hand it's not too bright either and good for reading a book to help fall asleep. Maybe not worth $15 dollars, but I don't feel as though I've completely wasted my time or money. It works and it's easy to use so all in all, not bad."
4,Perfect for reading in total darkness.,"Love this little book light. It's bright enough to read in pitch darkness without any glare. The neck bends and glides smoothly to whatever position I place it and stays put, so I have light right where I need it.The only problem is the clip, which is a bit bulky, especially when using on a paperback. To use on a paperback, I place the clip on about the last 60 pages of the book to make it work. It's more difficult to manage when I'm near the end of the book. The clip is better suited for use with hardbacks or lap desks. Still, I am happy with this little light. 4 stars!"
4,Like It!,"It's a great little light, maybe just a little too bright, but the light covers the whole page, neck is flexible, stands up by itself or clips to the book cover, it's light weight, price was right. I'm glad to have it!"
3,Not bright enough for long use.,"I bought this book light after reading all the positive reviews. I usually read for couple of hours at night. After using it for a week, I think light is dim. You can read books under it but you need a brighter light for heavy reading in dark. Reading in its low light for a long time caused me eye strain. I think it is good enough for moderate use. I ordered a brighter book light with 2 LEDs. This one is going back."
5,great little light,I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband so he could read his guitar music while we watch tv in the dark. He loves it. He clips to either his book or to a try on our coffee table. The neck is flexible without being flimsy and the light has a slightly bluish hue so it's easy on the eyes. I think I'll buy another for myself for reading in bed.
4,Nice but a bit bright,I purchased this recently and it is my first booklight so can't compare to other models but I will comment that I do find it extremely bright. My husband actually put on a pair of sunglasses as a joke one night as he lay next to me and recommended I just wear one of those forehead coal miner headlamps instead ;) Not bad but you may want to consider other recommendations for a model that is not as bright if you think this may be a problem.
4,Flexible light,"Good for small tasks, such as finding your earrings in a place not well lighted. Flexible and light, you can take it anywhere, provided you fed it with the batteries required. Long life."
1,Not really much lite,Would not say it bright. Would not use it for reading. it doesn't hold the head as well. Not recommende it.
2,LED is too blue for reading on Kindle,"Ugly bluish light. Not good for reading, at least not with Kindle. Seems well built, but waste of money. I'll never use it."
4,useful small task light,"This task light is quite a bargain for the price. It provides adequate and convenient light for night time reading or small tasks. It clips securely and easily to most thin sturdy surfaces. I use it mostly on books cuz I like to move around a lot when I read in bed.It works best on low reflective surfaces like cheap paperbacks. Smooth surfaces like slick magazine paper produce a lot of glare. The slide switch on my unit is hard to move. Most of the time I have to fumble or fight with it to turn off the light. That's a pain when I am almost asleep and want to turn it off. Also, the neck is a bit flimsy and tends to sag when extended horizontally somewhat from the base. This happens when I sometimes clip the base to the bottom of my bedside lampshade and bend the neck up and over (like a goose neck)my book."
4,Great bendy little book light,"I like the light because it's bright and can be twisted and turned any way you need. It's on off switch and the bendy neck are completely silent so you can use it without disturbing your spouse. It's a little too bright when I attach it to my book and shine it down so I usually lay it on my chest a little farther back and shine it away from my face and towards the book. Nice light, good price, nice red color."
5,works great & price is right,This is a great little light. Very flexible & easy to use. I like the clamp that also works as an independent stand.
3,"It's ok, but if you're buying for Kindle, buy an M-Lite","I have a book light by M-Lite company for my Kindle, which I really like. However, due to the way this light is engineered, I needed a second light for regular books. The light from this fulcrum light is harsh, but usually adequate. Sometimes it doesn't cover the entire page, so part of it is in shadow. It is a bit heavy, but workable. I am worried that it will start to ""blink"" as it ages, as some customers have complained about but so far--so good. I wish I had ordered the ""Mighty Bright"" instead and will do that next time, as this appears cheaply engineered."
1,save your money,Does not give enough lite. Was using on my computer to see the keyboard. Did not work on the computer nor a book.
1,Worthless,"This is the most worthless light, period. The light is so dim, I can barely see the book, let alone the wording. I tried replacing the batteries, no help. I would not recommend this light to anyone. Maybe I received a faulty light, but I would recommend purchasing another book/kindle light that actually offers light. The multi-flex neck is nice, but again, not enough light to read."
4,"Great Light Good Price, But...","Face it trying to put a light into a bed is always going to be a problem. I have stepped on this light, slept on this light, fell asleep with the light on and this light works almost flawlessly. It gives a nice even light that you could position easily as needed. There is very little overspill. The LED is a little ""blue"" but it is not distracting in anyway. Well, after 6 months of nightly use and abuse it has finally started to flicker when I move the goose neck sometimes. Also, the feel on the switch was never very satisfying. After looking at all of the available lights now I am going to buy the same one as a replacement.I had a Itty Bitty for years but when it finally died I decided that a LED was the way to go. Long battery life and even light were my main concerns. I am still waiting for the perfect light but until then this is my favorite."
5,Finally!,"I have bought more book lights than I care to say and almost all of them have ended up in a drawer. This little light is great. It gives a very clean, clear light with no shadows. The goose neck makes it easy to direct and easy to travel with. I have finally found a light that gives the light I need to read and does not disturb my husband. If you have been searching for the right book light, I highly recommend this to book lovers everywhere!"
1,You may not get what you ordered. Watch out for substitutes.,"We have ordered these booklights in the past, but recently we received a substitute that was NOT the Fulcrum booklight.The Fulcrum packaging will say ""Fulcrum"" on the back and the front of the package will say Multiflex LED Task Light.The INFERIOR substitute shipped to us was a generic LED light.I don't work for Fulcrum. I am just a consumer who expects to get what he orders."
5,Nice Light for the Price,"After looking at many of the lights Amazon carries, I decided on this one (was on sale and had many good reviews). After using for about a month, I am quite pleased with it: the bright white light covers the whole area and the neck stays in place. I sometimes even clip the base to the bedding; this works well for reading newspapers."
4,One of the best book lights I have found.,"I purchased this book light for use with my Kindle. It provides sufficient light to read by but could be a little brighter, thus the 4 rather than 5 rating. It can be attached to either the Kindle itself or to the Kindle case. The arm of the light is very flexible and can be positioned so that the light does not glare off the screen. A very good, quality product for a good price. I would recommend this book light for use with a Kindle."
5,great light for people who read late in bed.,I bought this because i was tired of my husband turning the bedroom light on to read at night. This is bright enough for him to see and doesn't shine in my face! i love it!!
4,Nice Product,"Very nice product, does what it promises to do. The only thing I would improve on it is the stifness of the flexible shaft. It could be just a little more rigid, but it is certianly not a big deal at all."
3,Bright enough for a book light,"The neck is not as flimsy as some people say it is. It's also usually only bright enough if you clip it on to the book. It's a good book light, but don't use it for anything other than that because it won't be bright enough. The clip is pretty large as well."
4,infinitely adjustable,"I am loving this book light! You can bend the arm any which way and the light is bright enough to illuminate two pages. The plastic clip feels kinda cheap (plastic), so I'm not sure how it will hold up, but so far, I am very pleased with this book light, especially for the price."
5,works great,"bought to use to read while i run on the treadmill. Lights up perfectly with out glare. Very easy to use, grips well and bends to many positions"
3,"Two light purple, one strong purple, and one white","I bought 4 of these things, and I'm somewhat disappointed. Only one of them was usable, while the other 3 had an annoying purple hue to them. I uploaded pictures to let you guys see what you'll be dealing with. There seems to be a relatively low level of quality control on them, and you're running the high risk of getting purple reading light when you buy one."
4,"Great idea, a bit cheesy.","It's a great idea. Product light is very bright. The feel of the product is cheesy and the neck of the product is a bit weak and ""floppy"". Perhaps a better grade of materials might also increase its weight a bit but the trade off might be worth it."
5,Perfect for my Use,Received the Fulcrum LED Task light before the estimated delivery date. It arrived in perfect condition. After inserting batteries I found it to throw a nice wide bright pool of light and the flex neck allows me to direct the light exactly where I want it. The clip holds securely to the edge of my Puja table.I am a meditation practitioner and do my practice in a window dormer alcove and at night the room light is behind me and casts my shadow over my Puja text. This is the perfect solution for me.Though I don't clip it to a book I think it would be light enough for that. Overall I am perfectly satisfied with this product and recommend it highly.
4,Can't go wrong.,For the price you get what you pay for. It is very cheap plastic but its also under $10. I really do like it and the fact it bends and clips on is a plus. Can't go wrong imo.
4,All credit to this device for my reading more,I love this light. The light is clean and easy to maneuver. If it provided a little more coverage it would get a fifth star.
4,Works well,I initially bought this LED for night reading but it does not work that well for reading books as it casts a shadow on the edges of the book making reading difficult. But it does work very well as a night light which is how I use it. The battery life is excellent and in the year I've had it I have only replaced the 3 AAA batteries three times even though I generally keep the light on all night. The flexible stem allows me to focus the light in any direction so I'm not blinded when waking up at night.
4,Book light,"Good little light with exceptional battery life. It is a little heavy for a paperback (light plus 3 AAA batteries).Only design change I think it needs is the clip should be flat against the pages instead of the cover. If you are not careful, you can tear the pages over the clip of it might wrinkle the pages. But it works well and makes my wife happy that I can turn out the bedroom lights when she is trying to sleep."
1,Useless and a waste of money,"The clip base is very weak and does not stay where placed, falls down after a few minutes. The neck of the light is also very weak and drifts down almost immediatly. Light is much too bright to be used in a setting where you don't want to bother others. All in all a useless product"
2,Light is not bright enough,"I thought this could be a good desktop light, but I was wrong. The light is so weak, and is useless. The only way I can tell the light is on is if I turn off all the lights in the room. Waste of money. Small and portable but functionality is terrible."
1,Fell apart after 4 weeks,This is a nice bright light with great flexibility. But the clip part of mine fell apart after 4 weeks and now I can't use it.
3,Not the greatest for Kindle,"Book light reviews are always subjective, so I had a real hard time choosing a new one and finally settled on this for my new Kindle.With the batteries in it and the way the clamp is made, it doesn't clip onto the ""naked"" Kindle anywhere. It will keep falling off unless you hold onto it with your hand. I've resisted buying a cover because of the added weight (I mean, the Kindle is supposed to be lightweight, right? That's its big selling point), but it looks like I'm going to have to cave in so I have something to clip this light to."
2,Fell Apart,"Well got this a few days ago, opened it, put batteries in and the turn on switch falls off. . . Um ok $8 down the drain. . . Bummers again."
2,Light dims after a few minutes' use,"The light dims after a few minutes use. It is very lightweight, which is a good feature, but the light became worthless. Not worth the shipping cost to return it. I think with these types of book lights, you get what you pay for. I'm willing to pay significantly more to get one that actually works, but haven't found it.Update: Amazon gave me a refund without having to ship the product back, which is appreciated."
4,Lots of light,"This small book light is great. It is the best one I've used so far, as the others even though also LED, did not provide adequate light. The light is bright and perfect for 2 page reading of average sized books. If reading 11 1/2"" manuals though, you can only read one page before adjusting for the next page to prevent shadows, hence the 4 star rating. I really like the adjustable arm and that it is so lightweight. It is really perfect for when the electricity goes out and you want to read a book while waiting for the power to return. I plan to order other colors to give with book gifts at Christmas."
5,Powerful!,So much better than a map light in the car or flashlight in bed. My son uses his every night. This is the best book light we own.
2,"Doesn't last long, and begins to flicker.","Thanks amazon for letting me write a short concise review. Sorry I have to fluff my review, but it is as simple as this; short lifetime and begins to flicker, which then the light dims to the point of no good use."
4,Some minor complaints but pretty good for the price,"So I bought the Fulcrum LED light based on the great reviews. I'm not at all disappointing but there are a few things I don't like that I want to point out:- Although the base is small, it's a little larger than I expected. It's not really that grippy so it tends to slip around a bit. It works ok on paperbacks.- The light is quite bright, which is great for reading of course! But there's also a pretty good chance of disturbing a bedmate- I've noticed that the light flickers sometimes. Haven't figured out exactly what it is yet. Might be when it's warming up or a sign the batteries should be replaced. But it ends up stabilizing.Overall a purchase that I am happy with!"
4,Nice little light,THis light is small enought to hook to your book and the neck moves a little bit which is slightly annoying but I like it and it is very bright.
3,It works but constantly flickers...,"I bought this based on all the good feedback, I either am easily irritated which is possible or I have a lemon. The thing outputs light that is very good, and spreads out nicely. But the light flickers constantly, with fresh batteries. I have tried removing the batteries and replacing them but it still flickers, I think I am going to ask for a replacement. It's very irritating!"
2,"Not for Kindle, and not great Q/C","I purchased the Multi Flex to go with my new Kindle eBook. Amazon recommends a different model, the Ultraflex2 by Mighty Bright, but they were out of that and this was on sale. They look almost identical in the pictures, so I figured it would work.First problem- did not work out of the box. I tried multiple battery sets, it would not turn on. At least in my case, the quality control is lacking.Second problem- it will not clip on to the Kindle. Only the bottom of the clip has anti-skid rubber stuff. The top clip is just plastic with not much contact area. It probably is fine for clipping to a normal book, but it would not provide a stable hold on the plastic Kindle. I do not know if the Ultraflex works better, but will find out.My rating is based on the Multi-flex not meeting my specific needs, and not working at all out of the box. If you get one that works (it appears most folks do) and you are going to clip it to a normal book, it might be a fine choice."
1,A good start...but not long lasting,"I bought this with high hopes based on the reviews but the 1 star ratings nightmares happened to me too! This light worked great for about a month. When I left for vacation I was looking forward to late nights reading a good book with a nice bright light. However, when I started using it regularly, it started flickering whenever I moved it. Sometimes it's bright and then the next moment there is barley a glimmer. I was very disappointed and now I'm stuck with it because it ""died"" right after the deadline for a full refund :("
5,Perfect book light!,"This book light is perfect for illuminating the full pages in an open book - even a paperback (clip the light to about 30 to 50 pages and it stays put just fine). It is by far the best book light I have found - and I'm a complete addict for reading books in bed. I especially like the the fact that the light is shielded from hurting your eyes while casting more than sufficient light on the book. The battery life is amazing. Three triple A batteries are still very light weight and sufficiently small to be used in a book light. Also, this light makes a great replacement for a candle in a power outage. Since it sits flat on a shelf, table, etc, it illuminates a whole room during a power outage."
3,Bright but Cumbersome,"The light from this LED book light is very bright and battery life is very good. However, it is bulky and cumbersome. I purchased this to replace my Lightwave. I prefer the LightWave in style, portability and functionality - but the surface does scratch over the years so I'd only give it four stars. I give the Fulcrum LED book light three stars. I'm still looking for the perfect booklight."
4,Love this light,"For $10.99, this is a great light. I love the flexible neck and the battery life. It packs well in my nightstand or my suitcase. The LED tends to give off a 'blueish' tint, but you get used to that. The clip is slightly bulky, but doesn't make the light unusable. The light doesn't typically bother my wife when I'm reading late at night (and should be sleeping). It has even doubled as a flashlight while stumbling around in my room in the middle of the night!"
1,Fulcrum Muti-Flex LED Task light,I bought this item for my daughter who is going on a 6 month internship in one of the national forest. What a piece of junk! This item broke right out of the package while inserting batteries. The cheap pot plastic is so flimsy it could not hold up to one opening/closing.
2,Light switch broke after 2 months light use,"The light-control switch broke on this after 2 months of light use. Even before that, I much preferred my ""mighty bright"", and use that light almost daily. This is a cheap imitation - the base is heavy, and the switch is flimsy."
3,Short life before flickering too much,"Ready to replace this one. It was good for the first 6 months or so, then started flickering. Kept getting worse and worse, now at the point of unusable for reading. At least it still serves some purpose as a nightlight when the baby wakes up."
1,Piece of junk,"This product failed within one hour of being used. The light switch is totally inadequate and was designed by a bunch of poorly trained chimps (with apologies to the chimps). For a tiny bit more money a proper switch could have been installed but instead what is present is an engineering joke. Reminds me of the quality of products from China from 20 years ago, not the more recent merchandise. Now, I must remove batteries to turn off the light. Avoid this product."
4,Does what i need it to do.,"only complaint is that it feels really cheap, but its a nice flood light style lamp. now my wife can stop doing her homework in the dark."
2,didn't last very long,"I found this to be fine in terms of the mechanics, but the led light went out remarkably fast. not sure why."
2,"Nice light, bad arm",I like the light. I used a light over my bed before that used a regular bulb and the heat often got too hot for being so close to my head (even though heat rises). I love the LED bulb concept and it is a bright light. The arm will NOT stay in place well though. Sad! I move it an inch and it moves BACK a half inch. So it's a constant adjusting and re-adjusting while I get it right where I want it. It's cheap so I put up with the hassle but I wish I'd paid a little more for one with a better goose neck.
1,should not be advertised as a grill light,"This is probably a great reading light, but not a grill light, does not give off much ligh at all."
4,"A quality, affordable light","I originally bought this to use for my 2nd Generation Kindle, because the case I used had no light. The clip has a good grip, holding the light firmly in place, but did not create any undue pressure on the Kindle itself. The light is very bright, and provides nice even lighting across the page. The flexible neck holds its position nicely until adjusted.I have also used this on a number of printed books. Again, the clip holds the light in place without damaging the books in the slightest. It has come in handy for providing illumination to all kinds of situations all over the house. A great light at an affordable price."
5,Great Balls o' Fire!,"Okay. So maybe great balls o' fire is an exaggeration. But this lit'l light packs a mighty punch. It's great for late-nite reading when I don't want to disturb my sleeping wife. The light clips securely to any book, making it unnecessary to move it for page turns. Plus, its beam is so broad it covers two pages at once; only the need for an occasional adjustment. After buying cheaper brands, this light was worth the small extra cost for one that will last and last and last."
3,Blueish light with a big plastic clip.,"I used this at an art show to help illuminate some pieces. I found the light to be a bit blue and the clip somewhat awkward. I imagine if you tried to use this with a book as a reading light it would be too heavy/bulky.It's not a bad little light, it's reasonably bright for it's size and I ordered several, all of which worked, but I will be looking for a brighter, whiter light for my next art show."
5,good one,I bought it years ago for reading book on bed. It still works well now except the cost for battery is a lot though.
2,Not bright enuff!!,Handy but.... Just not bright enough to see a keyboard or read a book by. Kept it for a kids gift.
3,Good light for lots of things,"This a good light for small tasks and book reading. I was hoping I would like it better than wearing my headlamp to read, but I felt like I was wrangling the light neck too often. I'll probably just stick with my headlamps, as they're a bit more versatile."
5,Add this to your emergency kit!,"This is a lightweight and bright booklight. When clamped to the book, I can read both pages without having to move the light. The clamp is strong and stays where you put it. I also bought 8 of these to use when I demo products at trade shows. I clamp it on the product and move the flexible arm to highlight what I want. It takes up no table space either. We also used them for emergency lighting when we lost power during the hurricane - for four days. The lights, using 3 AAA batteries, stayed on continuously for 3 days and 3 nights. The LED lights were bright and didn't get hot at all. They were easy to clip all over the house and are easy to move when we needed to look for something in a closet, pantry, or move to another room. No more flashlights with heavy, short-life ""D"" batteries for us. We now keep the lights on our nightstands and in our Emergency Kit!"
3,DS,"This product is OK. I do not use it much, but then maybe I should give it a2nd chance & start, but then I have a problem of where is the bestplace to clip it on my computer."
1,Not worthy of your money,Wanted this light to use during my commute to and from work. Currently I am using a GE Book Lite but it's too heavy and I have to hold the light on each page. Thought this light would be lighter in weight and actually clip onto the book. Clip works great and would satisfy my need but the illumination is minimal. If you truly want a light to read by then pass up this unit. If it wasn't for the return postage cost I would so return for a refund.
2,Cheaply made,This booklight was inexpensive -- and is cheaply made. The clip came apart after only a few days.I would not recommend.
2,Disappointed light.,"I really doesn't like it when I receive it. The light is so pale, I prefer the warm light, I am not sure if it is the problem of all LED light.After few times of use, I drop it, waste of money."
4,Ok for the price,"This light works very well for reading. It is a bit lightweight, but considering that you'll have it hanging off your book, it's perfect."
1,Junk,I've gone thru 2 of these & after a few weeks the wire inside comes loose. I managed to repair one by gluing the wire in place - have to turn it on & off by removing a battery. Don't buy these - they're junk.
2,flexible but disfunctional,"The flexibility is great. And you can make this work with most books other than the lightest paperbacks. The flaw? Very shortly into using it, it started flickering and wouldn't provide a constant, high light. The light would dim and I would have to hit it to get full light. Changing batteries didn't make a difference. It is great in concept, but in execution very disappointing. I don't want to have to buy one every month to keep it working."
5,Worth the price!,"Bought this to use with my books such as the Game of Thrones series. The LED light is bright and the flexible neck comes in handy. Isn't too heavy so any hardback book will work fine, or for paperbacks just attach it to a chapter or so worth of pages. What I've actually done is clip it to my headboard and use it as a sort of lamp. Definitely worth the money so far!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought these for my daughters to use for reading in bed. But these are tiny--much smaller than I expected when I bought them--and the light they throw is very narrow. That means they don't light the whole page, only a few lines at a time, and my daughters had to keep moving the book around in order to read. Not surpisingly, they stopped using them very quickly."
5,neat little light,"i was curious if this was just another dim light, but i was very surprised when i turned it on and i lit up the entire cab of my big rig work truck. i love it. i have quit a bit of paper work to to in the early morning darkness. my truck light just doesnt cut it. this little light adds enough light to get the job done. money well spent."
3,Super bright,Good price! I only give it 3 stars for 2 reasons:1) It's super bulky and doesn't really hold up well on my kindle due to the size comparison.2) The light has to be adjusted in a position that would disturb others because it causes a glare on my screen and therefore not letting me read...rendering it useless.
3,6 month life,"I use this about 2 to 3 hrs per day, 5 days per week. In six months, I have used 4 sets of batteries; not so bad. But now the bulb seems loose, it blinks on and off. I would expect a longer life from a product like this."
5,Fulcrim Task Light,"This went with the lapdesk for my son. He says it works great in dark places and since his job means he will be using his laptop anywhere, this sure comes in handy for him."
2,Poorly built,"This is a nice light when it works. After a few months of use, the light started flickering frequently. If I played with the switch (turn it off and on, or wiggle it) then it would settle down for a while. I just think that the switch is not well built."
4,great for sharing rooms,I purchased this lamp for myself and my roommate whom I share a room with. We both really like it because one of us can continue to study or work while the other one sleeps soundly because this reading lamp provides just the right amount of brightness to allow non-disturbance.
4,Very good reading light,"Pros: lightweight, sturdy, lasts a long time, light is still bright enough to read with when batteries are lowCons: too bright for a reading light when batteries on full chargeThe third different model I've used and its great"
2,Fulcrum multiflex LED Task Light,"It is about what you would expect from a booklight. The biggest concern was it was a bit more expensive than it could be. Takes too many batteries for such a little light. Booklights never last long so my suggestion is never pay more than you need - get the cheaper ones at the discount mega-stores and use it until it goes. Apparently, like it or not, we have become a society where things of quality no longer exist - just buy and toss."
2,It was not what I was looking for.,I needed a small light for my computer so I could work at night without disturbing my husband (having lights on). I was so disappointed to see how small this light was and to see that it did not put out very much light - I couldn't even see the keyboard to type. This was not what I was looking for.
1,Looked great - but broke in shipping,The title of my review pretty much says it all. It was broken in the package when i recieved it. The switch that turned it off and on had broken off and the light was useless. I was kinda bummed - b/c all the other reviews were so great.
2,not much of a light,"This may work for a very specific purpose but for general lighting it's not very practical. It's a weak light that is mounted with a clip, so you have to have something to clip it to. The on-off switch is not easy to find, presumably to protect it from being broken."
5,Good product,I got these for about 2 months now. I use it frequently and have not needed to change battery yet.I use it to clip on to my laptop because the light on the laptop for keyboarding is too dim.I also use it to tell bedtime story to my 3yr old. He thinks it pretty fun especially when we shine it onto popup books to make shadow on the wall.
5,Great Nite Lite!,great little light...very bright but not obtrusive enough to bother my husband when he's sleeping. Light weight and very mendable! Love it!
1,Terrible!,"I am very disappointed with this light. It is bright enough, but it has a blue cast (I think that's the LED) that really casts a strange light on what you are looking at. My biggest complaint though, is that it creates a shiny reflection on whatever it is over, including books and notebook paper! Moving it farther away and closer, or angling it from the side or straight down, does not help, it's the stark quality of the light itself. It literally makes it difficult to see what you are looking at. Waste of money. I have other booklights in a range of qualities, but none that put a cold, bluish shine on whatever you are looking at. I much prefer the softer light of a standard bulb (or standard booklight), even if it is less bright.In fairness I will add that the quality of the item itself seems fine, the neck is flexible and long enough to direct in a number of positions.Still, if you are doing anything but knitting (could it reflect off of yarn?), this is not recommended."
3,Way too bright!,"The design of this light is great. I love the adjustable neck and the clip. However, I wanted this to be able to read without disturbing my husband next to me in bed. It's like a dang flashlight. It is so bright it hurts my eyes to look at the book. My husband even told me to turn off the lamp. Now I am going to see if I can put a dimmer led in it or something. If you want bright get this."
2,Light works...but the shade of light is blinding,"I know this is solely a personal preference...but trying to read a book that is illuminated by a LED light is BLINDING. it gives you a headache and makes you squint. Well, that is at least what I experience when I use this light. I went to a local crafts store and bought a single sheet of transparent light yellow paper and taped it to the light so that a yellow tint light illuminates my books. Now, the light is more natural looking and I don't have to squint and I don't get headaches. The LED lights extend the battery life DRAMATICALLY however...and I'm glad for that. I just give this a 2 star rating because they could have tinted the plastic lens covering the LED lights so that the light wasn't so blinding..."
2,"Great As Long as It Works, But That's Not Long","This item initially impressed me: affordable, compact, bright, easy to position. But within a couple months the on/off switch stopped working properly, and now it's almost impossible to keep from flickering. Not worth it."
5,Best light,This light is to replace my daughters old reading light. It is perfect. The flexibility makes realign in bed (on her side usually) easy for her. The light is bright enough but not too bright. The cushioned clamp is perfect for her kindle and gentle on books. I have already recommended this light and would over and over again (especially for the price!)
1,"Loved initially, but extremely short life span","I bought this a year ago. It worked great for the first month or so and the bendable portion was stiff enough, but then it started flashing or turning off (not from lack of battery power) and I had to keep fiddling with the bendable portion trying to get it to stay on. Became progressively worse until now when it's virtually impossible to get it to turn on despite new batteries."
3,Light is not so bright,"The light is not as bright as I expected. Although it clamps easily and bends nicely, the head and bulb are rather flimsy."
2,Not bright enough to read medium hardback book.,"Based on other reviews I expected this to be a bright light with a broad beam. It isn't. I wonder if I have a defective one.There's only one LED bulb and when I try to read at night, I have to keep moving it very close to parts of the page as I move down. It's easier to hold a flashlight.I'm very disappointed, but I destroyed the packaging and it would cost too much to return, so I've repurposed it as a keyboard light for the laptop. It gives just enough light to see where the keys are, but not enough to read them on the opposite end."
2,Too bright for reading in bed.,I wanted a book light because i love reading in bed at night and my night lamp is too bright for my partner sleeping next to me. turns out this book light is almost as bright as my night lamp itself. I have to twist and turn the neck of the lamp in a lot of weird positions to read without disturbing my partner and it's a real pain. It can be used as a task light though. It has a very flexible neck and it's easy to carry when travelling.
3,"Fulcrum Multi-Flex LED Task Light, Silver","It makes a good clip-on book light, but it's not really bright enough in its free-standing mode to use on a desk."
5,Best Book Light,"This is by far the best book light I have ever owned. The light is perfect, the clip stays where you put it, and the batteries last a long time! Anyone looking for a book light or replacing one of those expensive ones that break, burnout, and burn through batteries should buy this book light!"
4,Nice reading light,"This light performs its job well. However, there are times when flicker is noticed, although I notice it more than my wife does - and she is the main user, so we'll keep it but I wish it didn't have said flicker. Quality is good for the price of the item. Another thing I'd wish for is a second, lower-intensity, setting."
5,Let there be light!,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year-old daughter. She loves it! She reads so much and likes to read a little before bed to relax into the night. The clamp holds tight, the light halo given off is plenty big enough to illuminate the pages of the books she reads, and the light is the appropriate brightness. She and I are very pleased with this purchase and am going to buy a light like this for myself."
5,Good,"Hi,So far I am satisfied with the 12-cup coffeemaker. No issues..it is not complicated ..very easy to use."
4,"It's good, but we found something we like better","This is a really good soldering iron, and of course if you use Weller products, then you have all the weller tips. We compared this one, a road pro (least expensive), and the Antex MLXS soldering iron (you need to do a google search, there's a US distributor). The Antex has some pros and cons vs the weller. The pros are it's slightly thinner, so it doesn't take up as much room in a kit bag, and it seems to reach temperature more efficiently than the weller (we used an in-line watt meter) so if you're running from a battery it's a bit better. The cord for the Antex isn't as high quality though, so while it works, it's not as heat resistant as the weller.I prefer the Antex, but if you have Weller stuff already, then the Weller is a perfectly good way to go.By the way, the <$10 Road Pro iron is pretty good too! Just that you can't get different sized tips for it."
5,Excellent reference book for swords used in the Revolution.,"Nearly 750 individual swords, knives, axes (including tomahawks), bayonets, and polearms, shown in detailed photos with demensions, weights, and provenance of the weapons. I suggest getting the hard cover edition, becouse of the constant use in looking up facts before purchasing collectable weapons."
3,Not the wiper in the picture.,Got the wipers and they are Rainy Day but no where do they show the brand name Anco on them or the package. Amazon will return them for free but really dont feel like waiting and they were just intended to be a cheap replacement on a car that's going to be sold.
5,Excellent,"I bought the black version of this monitor, and it is fantastic (VE155b). Very bright display, excellent contrast, very realisitic color for and LCD. Nice refresh rate for an LCD as well. I recommend it!"
4,good toilet - noisy flush,"We got this toilet in 2006 (now 2011), and it works well. The flush is noisy, but we have gotten used to it. Inner workings have needed replacing within the last year."
1,Bad product,I purchased this product because my family had the same & assummed I would receive the a good product. But it is no good. I have had it installed & have replaced the water valve & it still continues to run. Even the plumbers ae perplexed. Now it still continues to run & I will have to have a plumber out to try & find the problem. It probably will demand a water stopper replacement. And that means I will have replaced all the moving parts to get it to run properly. I am totally dissastified at this toilet. Maybe the price should have warned me not to purchase.
5,Amazing! Gets hot FAST!,"Honestly, asides from working on a really large project, where I need to use the iron on and off for an hour or so of building, this is probably going to be my new go-to-iron. Not only is it super mobile, letting you take it anywhere without the hassle of plugging it in... this thing get's hot fast. The description said ""melts solder in 40 seconds""... I have no problem melting solder in 20 seconds.This iron is easy and intuitive to use. Anyone who uses a soldering iron would be well suited to buy one of these."
2,Did Not Ignite Tried Everything.... Will not Replace...,"Does not work. I have never given a one star review, and I am giving this a two star review just because I like the way the soldering iron looks.....I purchased this Soldering Iron after taking into consideration all the reviews. Maybe I just got a lemon, but after proper filling it with butane; this piece did not ignite. I tried every angle, flow position, and even took the tip off. After at least a hundred clicks, this soldering iron still has not ignited. I tried to search the internet for a solution, but I have found nothing of value. I also went to the US Rep's website, and still no usefull information on this model. I really needed this for a laptop project I wanted to do today. I wasted a few bucks on butane, and I will still have to go get an el chepo soldering iron to do the job..."
1,weller p2c soldering pen,"This is the second device that I received, the first one I could not adjust the temperature and the second one worked for about a week then quit working. :("
5,soldering solution,"This tool is the perfect solution for a variety of everyday uses for soldering. It has plenty of heat-power (fully adjustable) to handle most common tasks. For my money, it's just great! Easy to operate, simple to store, ready in short order, just right."
2,Slow,"Maybe I am not doing it right, but how could I mess this up? I am not happy with how it has worked, so back the old plug in model."
1,Waste of money,Not well made or a well-thought idea. Tore up at seams after a few days. Go with the hard plastic.
1,Just ship it already!,"I still haven't received my book yet. I ordered my book the first week of January. It said it would ship by January 17. It had not shipped until January 20. Now I am still without my book and on top of that, I am not able to track the shipment so I have absolutely no clue when it is going to get here! I don't know if this is because of the shipping company choice or if it was because of the seller dragging their feet to get it shipped. I will try to write a review on if the book is actually in good shape, but we'll see!"
5,Not only Muffin Tops,"I bought 2 of the muffin top pans for my sisters birthday. She had the same ideas as most other people, but then started coming up with lots of other uses......mini-cakes(douple layered), cookies, tarts, cornbread, mini cheezecakes; the list goes on and on, but one of the ideas I liked best was, make cookies, then freeze ice cream in small shallow containers, put them all together for fabulous ice cream sandwiches. Now if I could only find cup-cake top pans :-) YUMMM"
2,Too Flimsy,I was disappointed with this pan. It is flimsy and light-weight. I expect some density in my bakeware; I expected Cuisinart to deliver.Muffin bottoms burn in a heartbeat. I would not recommend.
3,Not sure yet...,Did not know what the muffin tops would be like and I can't decide if I like them (depends on the muffin type itself I guess). The pan is definitely easy cleanup. I use it for that if nothing else. Will keep experimenting with muffin recipes.
3,ITEM IS LIGHTER THAN I EXPECTED,"OUR OTHER CUISINART BAKEWARE IS MUCH HEAVIER IN CONSTRUCTION THAN THIS PAN. INDEED, IT ARRIVED WITH 4 SMALL DENTS DUE TO IMPROPER PACKING WITH A CAST IRON PAN. IT'S OK, BUT SEEMS ""OUT OF PLACE"" WITH OUR HEAVY-DUTY BAKEWARE."
2,Incorrectly Described,I purchased this item to fit in my toaster oven. The pan is several inches larger than described. If it had been as described it would have fit perfectly! It's going back. I give 2 stars because it looks like a great pan... just not for what I needed!
4,I like this pan,These muffin top pans are so hard to find so I was super happy to find it here. It arrived super quick too so that's always a plus.I bought this pan for a specific purpose. I was dissappointed that it was flimsy for a Cuisinart product but overall it works exactly for my intended use.
1,Non-stick surface isn't,"Worked at first, but after a few cleanings the non-stick properties are gone. And yes, I have tried everything from cooking spray to crisco, and I know how to pre-heat and bake properly. And I've tried the pan in two different ovens. It's simply no longer possible to bake anything in it without being ruined, and if I have to take the time to cut out little parchment circles every time, the convenience of the pan shape is kinda lost. Go with a different brand, or get egg rings depending on what you are making."
1,Disappointed,"I expected this muffin top pan to be 7 inches by 11 inches, as advertised, and it came in HUGE! I cannot use it in my convection oven and that's all I have to use right now. The pan itself looks nice, but I am disappointed with the size. Maybe I will give it away. Very unhappy!"
3,Great quality!,"The quality of these pans is wonderful, but I wish the muffin tops were a little bit smaller, as they would be thicker."
3,NOT NON STICK,Okay I bake from scratch once a week. Lots of cakes and cupcakes. My friend asked for cupcake tops. So ordered three trays. Greased and Floured and they still stuck so next time will use parchment or wax paper to line cups. Wish someone would invent muffin top papers. that would be the best!
2,Needs a lip,"After reading positive reviews, I was very excited to receive these pans and bake muffin tops. I love the size of the pan, and the directions were great, however I used them one time and will be returning them. They do not have a lip that I can grip easily with my oven mitt to pull them out of the oven. I had to use some tongs and pull the pans forward and then grab on to them. Bummer. I will look for another brand with a lip."
1,"Great idea, but not a great product","I thought this would be great, but as it turns out the idea of the product was better than actuality. If you do purchase, be sure to cook on a lower temp and longer than what your directions call for. Also, use a smaller amout of grease to coat."
1,mixed messages,"I am a devout Christian and was looking forward to an inspirational movie, but this misses the mark. After waiting 40 years for the right man, the main character settles for a married drug dealer who puts his wife in a home and divorces her to marry the main character. To me that isn't a good Christian story. Also, the acting is terrible!!! Oh, and the main character wears VERY tight revealing outfits which in my book were not good choices for a Christian."
4,On sexual purity,"Great story about sexual purity. unfortunately,more and more professed Christians throw that part of the christian living under the water,and give into the temptations of this day and age. Pamela,the main character,a beautiful and somewhat naive woman is so refreshing.this is a simple and feel good story with an uplifting and encouraging message about waiting and not giving into pre-marital sex.i'm so glad i watched the movie and will recommend it."
4,Excellent compliation,"This book provides a fascinating look into what multilateral diplomacy has become in the post Cold War Era. It is very helpful to scholars and students, especially those engaged in Model UN programs."
4,It gets the job done!,I needed a mat for my Valentine's picnic and didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount on the mat. I found this one and it was the perfect price! It got the job done and my boyfriend like it.
3,Doesn't match photo nor description.,"I wanted to order a replacement just like I had in the past. The photo and description didn't match the colors of the mat at all. Not even close. It's not worth it to return it, but I'm not real happy with it."
5,Very Durable and Useful,"I bought one of these products at a big box store years and years ago and it's come in handy not only for camping but for a variety of other uses, so recently I bought another from Amazon to use to line my ""petting zoo"" for a couple of pet rabbits I've adopted. I find them very sturdy, they unfold to a generous size, and they fold up to a very portable size, with a clever and useful carrying handle as you see pictured. This makes it easy to store out of the way when you don't need it. For those with a need for protective mats, for camping, carpet protection or a variety of other uses, this product does the job just fine."
4,thinner than the last mat,I love these folding mats. I haven't been able to find them for awhile. This is a little thinner than the last one I bought but I'm happy
1,hard wired light,"as explained by seller, this needs to be hard wired. there isn't a way for this to stand. i was informed it is to be cemented.would i buy another product from this company, probably not! to vague in their description.it is too costly to return so it will go 'on sale' in my front yard.thank you"
3,Disappointed,"Description at the time I bought it was a little confusing.. I thought the book had a sound feature where you hear the bear snore, that would have been great. Almost returned it but felt I could read it and make the sounds, but I would have preferred it the other way."
5,Favorite Bedtime Book!,This is our bedtime book. My baby is only 3 months and he listens intently to every word and likes to look at the pictures. I love the rhyming and the sweet story.
4,A warm story of friendship,"I bought this book for my 3-year old daughter based on the reviews I read on amazon.com. It exceeded my expectations with its easy prose and simply detailed illustrations, but even more with the kind story about friends coming in from the cold to gather. ""Bear Snores On"" quickly became her bedtime favorite, and I have yet to tire of reading it to her."
1,I don't know why people like this one,"My 2-year old loves books but we're not fans of this one. I really don't know why it's so highly rated. The rhymes are very long and wordy, and they don't roll off your tongue very well. In fact, I get tongue-tied while reading this one. There are too many adjectives, such as ""An itty-bitty mouse, pitter-pat, tip-toe, creep-crawls in the cave from the fluff-cold snow."" Really? I think part of the issue is that the rhyming is inconsistent (one page rhymes, next one doesn't) so it really breaks up the flow. I also think the font is too delicate for reading in a dimly-lit room (when you're winding down for the night), which also makes it read to read.I don't like the story either - I don't want to encourage my child to know what not being able to sleep means!!!"
2,"Cute, but not as pictured","The book on the ""Look inside"" display shows a snore button...that would have been hilarious and fantastic. It was also what I was expecting, since it's what was on the displayed book. Unfortunately, mine didn't have a snore button...disappointing, but it was still a cute story and nice book."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful",This is a extremely wonderful book and great series. The nieces love it and I never tire of reading it to them.
5,Great Book,"I have the book and my 3 year son old loves it. My 6 year old daughter loves it as well, partly because she can read it by herself.I'm hoping for a Kindle version to use while traveling."
5,My two-year old adores it!!!!,"I am generally very picky about children's books for my daughter. I always look for stories that present nice language and tasteful, subtle illustrations. I avoid media-inspired books at all cost, as we are a TV-free family (plus I find them plain ugly).This book did not only meet my expectations; it soared beyond them. This book is not only beautiful, it is also incredibly cute and hilarious too! I strongly recommend it to everyone!!!!"
5,Fun to read,This is a very fun book to read because of the rhythm and fun use of words. My 4 year old and I find ourselves saying parts of the book for memory to each other because we read it every night! Haven't gotten tired of it yet.
5,Hibernation at its Best!,"We try to teach the children alittle about hibernation and how the bears sleep thru winter.This is the story of a big brown bear, and how other animal friends come into his cave and have a party while he is sleeping, and what happens when he wakes up and finds out that they are having a party without him!Great book, the children help by saying ""and the Bear snores on"" after each animal joins the party!Ellen"
5,Bear Snores On Board Book,"I'd recommend this to others. Sweet little story with cute illustrations. It was not a new book, but certainly looked like it."
5,"Charming, fun book!",My daughter loves this book (22 months old) and my husband and I enjoy the sing-song rhyme as well. It has a nice rhythm for reading aloud. We don't mind reading it over and over! The illustrations are great also.
5,"Wonderful book to read, play and read again!","I first saw this book in a Discovery Toys catalog and love the fact that I saved more than $5 buying it on Amazon.comThis is the MOST wonderful book. It is our bed-time story every night and my 2 year old knows it by heart. She has learned all of the animals, the noises they make (chew chomp crunch) and shouts BEAR SNORES ON at every page!This book is beautifully illustrated, simple enough for a toddler but detailed enough for Mom and & Dad to enjoy!BUY THIS BOOK, you will NOT be disapointed!We can't wait for Bear Wants More which is due out soon!"
5,Can I go higher then 5 stars?!?!?,"This has been by far the best book purchase I have made for my son so far. Bear Snores On has the most beautiful pictures I've seen in quite some time. The story rhymes and reads in a smooth rhythm that any child will love. We read this book at least 3 times daily and my son aside...I never get tired of it! I highly recommend this book, I am very impressed by it."
5,Terrific book!,"My 18 month-old loves this book, as do I. The story and illustrations are fantastic and I have given it as a gift many times."
5,Great Fun!,This is a wonderful book with wonderful illustrations! The book uses rhyming and repetition to weave a great story! As a parent I love reading it to my son and he loves the pictures!
5,Brilliant Book!,"My son is 18 months old and this is his favorite bedtime book. Even when he's half asleep, whenever I read, ""And the bear snores on"" his little hand reaches up to push the button and hear the bear snore. He actually thinks it's a growl, so he growls with it during the day. The story is cute and the rhymes are great. Those Brits are brilliant!"
5,Great for parents (to read) and kids!,"I have a one year old and we've probably gone through 20 or so of the 30ish children's books we've received. My husband and I just love this one. It's a cute story for adults with tiny paragraphs or so per page rather than a few words then on to the next page. It's nice to read something with a story arc rather than 'this is this' and 'that is that'. A big plus is the number of opportunities for funny voices. Mouse squeaks, hare's crisp English accent (when I read), badger's gruff, and bear's deep bass. This will be a go-to book for shower gifts now."
5,Bear Snores On,"This is such a wonderful and interesting book to read out loud. The rhyming is beautifully done with clever word choices. If you are not a good story teller, this book sort of helps you out. Flip through the pages and you'll see that some of the letters are capitalized. It gives you the cue that you should emphasize on that part. Someone with great talent in story telling should not feel that your style is being constrained by these cues. Ignore them by all means because the fun part when reading a picture book out loud is when you can express the words in your own style. I think, the ""cues"" is probably just the author's way of setting the book differently from the others. It could also be the author's reading expression being literally translated onto the paper.Whatever it is, the book is fun to read!!"
3,My son loves the book but it arrived in poor condition.,The book itself is great but it arrived bent and in bad condition. It looked like some other kid had played with it for a few months before it made it to my doorstep. I reordered the book from somewhere else.
3,High Quality but Expensive,"Not much to say about a propane tank, but this one is an expensive, high quality item."
4,A good introduction to MP3,"This book claims to be ""a fast introduction to MP3"", and it serves that purpose very well. Engineers looking for precise technical detail won't find it here, but anyone who's heard of MP3 and wants to know more about what it can do and how to use it will appreciate the book's clear, approachable text."
3,Decent stuff but hard to use,"This book has decent stuff in it, but it was hard to use. Like I wanted to use MusicMatch, and all the information is there, but its spread out all over the place, mixed in with information about other products. A lot of the book was on stuff like turning tapes into MP3 and doing weird things to MP3 files. Not much use to people who just want to listen to music on the PC."
3,"Highly Technical, Mathmatical textbook","Very technical with many mathmatical equations, exapmles and theorms. Includes exercises, and case study information. There are however, no answers to the exercises, and few ""worked out"" math problems. The format is very much a text book."
1,good for a lead sinker,"this is the worst piece of junk i have seen in a long time. not only does it ruin your knife edge, it pushes your knife through unevenly. all i can say is BUYER BEWARE."
4,Sharpener,"The two blade sharpening openings on the left side which establish the new V edge are difficult to get used to and in addition, the sharpening portion on the right has to beused with a controlled motion through the sharpening entrances. The instructions need to be more detailed ."
2,Chef's Choice 100W,This sharpener did not do a good or even semi-good job on the knives I tried it on. Removed too much metal and did not leave a good edge. It sounded really good but in practice was not. I'm sticking to my sharpening steel.
2,"OK for miscellaneous knives, not for the GOOD stuff!","I also have to echo the comments of other reviewers when saying if you have inexpensive, common cutlery this sharpener will work OK. If you have Chef's Quality cutlery don't bring it near this machine. It leaves a rough edge no matter which stone you use and simply isn't meant for good quality knives. If you paid a couple of hundred dollars or more for your set of kitchen knives, get them professionally sharpened. If you have run-of-the-mill cutlery this machine will do OK."
5,Great for the home,"Professional like sharpening in the home at a good price. I love this sharpener and trust it's performance on good knives. The magnetic guides make sure you sharpen the knife correctly so go ahead, run your expensive knives through it; it does a great job."
5,A wonderful book that only gets better with age.,"I first read FMD ten years ago when I was a young mother. I found it hard to read then, with the abandonment of a child so intimately described, but was glad I pressed through to the wonderful end. Last month, I read Evensong and went back to read FMD and found it even more wonderful, the second time around. It is so seldom these days that such a kindly book comes along that handles tough themes with tenderness and grace. I especially liked the way G Godwin allowed Madelyn to return and reveal Margaret's mother to her. On my second reading, I was much less judgemental myself, much more understanding of Ruth. It made me examine my own relationship with my own daughters, and how long has it been since a novel has made me do that? Too long, I think."
5,A Father and A Daughter's Close Relationship,"At age six, Margaret's mother goes away and never returns. Margaret is raised by her father, an Episcopal priest, who suffers from bouts of melancholia. As a result, father and daughter support each other during Margaret's childhood and young adulthood. It is a unique relationship, grounded in Christian beliefs. A moving and unforgettable story!"
1,"Gail Godwin's ""Father Melancholy's Daughter"" was terrible.","I had to read a book by Gail Godwin for my Southern author's project in Junior English class. I chose ""Father Melancholy's Daughter."" I found it hard to read, with no real theme. It is about a girl and her self-made responsibility to her father. The book went on and on for what seemed liek forever, and then the person who Margaret has hated for her whole life she turns round and likes. The book was not one I would EVER recommend to anyone, except maybe if I did not liek the person."
3,Reading this book is like carrying a cross,"Godwin is a wonderful writer, but this book is oppressively long. One of the themes of the book is that we all have a cross to bear, and I felt like I was bearing my cross just by finishing the book. What a shame. This would have made three very good books."
2,An unorganized and boring book M.S. period 1,"This book took a while to get into and it was not in an organized manner. It did not evoke suspense because it gave away the entire story at the beginning of the book. When it told in the first chapter how Margaret's mother died after she went on vacation with a friend, the rest of the story just retold everything that happened before that event. I would get confused because at any time -since I couldn't tell when was the present- could be a flashback and change the subject completely."
4,Great polish,It's a good polish but I was a bit surprised at the small size of the bottle. My mother always used this polish.
3,okay,"I enjoy just about anything that Ian Richardson is in , Mountbatten, House of Cards, etc. and he is good in this but I really don't think it's his cup of tea. The movie is ok but I can take it or leave it."
3,Porterhouse Blue,"It was good for the secondhand price of about $5.00. Typical 1980's English TV theatrical release. Good acting and storyline. DVD quality is average at best, about the same as regular VHS video tape which has been mentioned in other reviews. Those with a background and or love of English Television Drama from the 1980's and 1990's would appreciate this or if you have a background that is English or those anglophiles amongst us :-)"
3,A failed black comedy,"Despite the fine acting and production quality, this film is a great disappointment. The problem is the script. It's a ham-handed blast at the British Establishment, lacking subtlety and insight. The characters are stereotypes, and one can't empathize with any of them. The sub-plot involving sex between a student and his housekeeper is so pathetic that it's embarrassing. There is practically no humor more sophisticated than the Benny Hill variety. The ending, while unpredictable, is simply absurd. In short, this is failed black comedy. What a shame to waste the great talents of Jason and Richardson."
1,Brews Bad Coffee,"Dispite varying the amount of coffee (and coffee brands)coffee comes out either bitter, or just weak. Unable to get a flavorable cup of coffee from it. The container for the coffee grounds is difficult to remove and replace. The carafe with the attached cover is difficult to wash."
2,An Average Joe,I have found that this coffee maker will make an average cup of coffee but not a great one. I have found a problem with asidity and strength of the coffee even after trying high quality gourmet coffees. I have not had a problem cleaning the decanter or the basket but I have had trouble putting them back together. When cleaning above the basket I have had trouble removing the residual coffee that has splashed up from the basket. Over all it just has a cheep feel to it.
2,Disgusted,"Ordered this with thoughts it would be fullfilling. Come to find out, there are many pages torn from the book,the binder of the book is coming off, 4 big gold stickers on the front page (what in the world are they for?) and the hard cover is scratched and torn all over. Absolutely disgusted with this product."
5,Love the Tennessee comforter and bed skirt!,I am very pleased with this Tennessee comforter and the matching bed skirt. It is very well made and definitely is not skimpy on the size! And a true Tennessee orange! My daughter loves it.
1,Don't even look at this book,I am vert disaapointed. This is a 6-page document with no real value. I recommend that Amazon takes this title out of their catalog so no one else can purchase it. It is waste of money!
5,The best book on the case.,"Jim Fisher's book is outstanding. You don't have to believe that Lindbergh killed is son. You don't have to believe the Fich story. No theories here, just the facts. Courageous, fascinating, and totally convincing."
3,Good read for Lindbergh-case fans but lacks objectivity,"The book makes interesting reading for followers of the Lindbergh kidnap case but does very little as an objective, historical research source.Fisher pushes for the official, established view of the State prosecution therefore conveniently ignoring controversial evidence. This book has clearly being sponsored by the New Jersey establishment in the light of new evidence and the flood of other books that have presented serious doubts about Hauptmann's guilt.This book is a must-have for those interested in the case because it allows the reader to understand the mind of the prosecution. However, casual readers of this book will definetely have a utterly biased view of the evidence pro and against Hauptmann."
1,Not fit for office use,"I wanted a 1600x1200 resolution at 19"". This is what this product advertises- but this is impossible. The refresh rate is too slow, you cannot use this setting at all.I'm a developer. I look at tons of text all day long. I scroll through thousands of lines of code.I have a dual screen setup, my lefty is a CTX 17"" color monitor. And I needed a decent replacement for my righty. It seemed at the time the ViewSonic 19"" E90f True Flat was a good choice. I read up a ton on the matter.But the thing is terrible. At 1600x1200 the refresh rate is horrid. A step down for me is 1280x1024. This is decent- It's actually possible to look at a white background on a webpage. But at that setting, it's the same as my lefty, only bigger size physically on my desk.This monitor is not fit for -office- use."
2,cheap,"received as a gift, and no later than 1 1/2 year old started having a short inside monitor, currently i have to beat/bang on top/side to get full brightness, (very annoying)..personally i'll never buy their products."
3,Pretty good... but mostly a 'picture gallery',"There is a lot of good information, but it is mostly beginner 'common sense' bonsai information, such as how to sow seeds. Half the book contains just pictures of bonsai (beautiful, but only a small portion is dedicated to 'principles and techniques' like the title promises). I LOVED the section on miniature rock formations and a glimpse into 'suiseki' (the art of rock appreciation). A good book for a the coffee table."
3,Good reference but lacking,"This is an informative book. Especially about basic plant & tree care. However, it seems some things are kept in the ancient chinese secret catagory. Such as shaping. It goes into certain subjects lightly and then says you need a basic understanding of the tree that you are working with, it's characteristics etc. These characteristics you must get from another book or 30 years of experience I guess."
4,excellent book,I've read this book from cover to cover. I'm already on my 3rd bonzai tree. What an excellent book! You can tell the publisher and the author put alot of work into it.nice job
5,Excellent,"I bought this book in a bookstore for the pictures. I bought another book (which had black and white pictures) for information. When I got home I read through both books and found that the information in Liangs book was far better in information as well as the pictures. The other book has since been given away as a ""gift"" to one of my bonsai friends :)Great pictures, great info what more do you need?"
4,"Book on the more advanced techniques, very desciptive.",Excellent pictures and graphics to help on techniques of bonsai
5,Go-to book on Bonsai technique,"I love this book. I have many books, but this one is rich which information about practical to advanced Bonsai technique. It is well written and clear. I highly recommend this book. I would buy it again if my copy were somehow lost."
3,recomendatiion,"They were good. I enjoyed them. The price is reasonable. I reccomend it to all, sci fi buffs or not."
3,WHERES THE WALL CHARGER,I Like the product and speedy delivery. But wheres the wall charger that hooks up to the back of the cradle
2,Complex sharpener,This sharpener does not do the job as easily as stated by the info on the site. It takes to long to sharpen the knives. Matter of fact I still have not been able to put a razor sharp blade on any of my knives. I would not purchase this sharpener.
4,Knife Shartpener,"Works fine. No complaints. Not sure what the difference is to the much more expensive ""professional"" model. Good for routine household knives"
4,Impressed with the product quality. It really works,The sharpener does a good job on all sizes and shapes of knives - from my big chinese cleaver to the small boning knife. When it's time to re-sharpen I often just use the honer. It brings the knife edge right back to super sharp.
4,"""GOOD KNIVES GET GOOD RESULTS""","I have to say that the sharpener is probably only as good as the knives I am trying to sharpen.I thought the diamnod hone would be the best , and it may be if one has a decent set of knives..All in all it took a lot of passes to sharpen knives..Sooo"", I'd have to say that the Chef's Choice would be a good buy price wise, ability etc..Sooo"", now I guess I need to get a really good set of harden steel knives or something..I would recommend this sharpener.Any sharpener is not going to do the job right if you're using reallly cheap flimsy knives..""Make sure you have a set of good knives 'FIRST'.."
1,Flame Thrower,This morning I sharpened a knife using my Chef's Choice 300. When I pressed the off/on button to off the machine made a loud pop and a actual flame shot out of the body. It burned my pointer and index finger. I bought mine at Sears. I sent an e-mail to Chef's Choice a few minutes ago asking them to refund my money. I will let you all know if they cooperate or if I have to file complaints with the Consumer Protection Agency et al.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,The Service from Amason and follow up was 5 stars but the product it self is not as good as I hoped
4,Good buy,For the price it's worth it. I had a very blunt knife & after 5 minutes I could see a ...well a sharp difference ;) got another as a gift the next day.
3,"Chef's Choice 300 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener, White",Slow and a little hard to use. Does a decent job IF you do what they tell you to do then you get a decently sharpened knife. Use it on protected surface since slivers of the metal shed as it is sharpened.
3,sharpens knives but difficult,"The diamond plates move back and forth. I have to hold the knife firmly because it tends to push it toward me. I was under the impression that the sharpening device was rotating diamond wheels.It works, the price is right but the oscillating diamond plates make sharpening difficult. Seldom use its OK."
3,It's OK,"It works OK, but it's not fool-proof. Magnets show correct angle to slide knife, but aren't strong enough to maintain the angle by themselves. I suppose if they were stronger it would be tough to slide the knife smoothly. I just thought it would be easier to use. I have a nice diamond hone (old fashioned type, the stick like Chef Ramsay uses :) ) that works quite well, but is slow on a knife that hasn't been maintained. I suppose this CC300 will get easier with practice."
1,I EVEN DIDNT USE IT,WHEN I JUST CONECT TO ELECTRICTY A HUGE POMP SOUND CAME UP AND THE ROOM WAS FULL WITH SMOKE OUT OF IT.
3,good for the kitchen,works well and love the larger slits in the machine. I was able to use it not only on my kitchen knives but also my hunting knives.
5,Keeping your blades sharp with the Chef's Choice,"After investigating knife steels, oil stones, water stones,and various gadgets this sharpening device is truly a ""Chef's Choice"". It is easy to use, requiring only a light touch. It does a great job in sharpening your knives and does not take a long time. Another benefit is the price and better still the immediate savings when you buy the Chef's Choice 300W Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener from Amazon. This purchase will NOT CUT into your wallet !! My Henkels and Sabatiers have nice sharp honed edges. Now I think I need to buy a new cutting board....."
3,Good at this price but disappointing at the price I paid,"Unfortunately, I paid twice the www.Amazon.com price from a local store several years ago, and I must say it is one of the few kitchen appliances I have been disappointed with. It takes a long time to get all the knives honed to the angles of this sharpener. Then keeping them sharp seems to take a long time and they never seem to get as sharp as one would expect. The motor heats up quite easily after a few knives and begins to smell like it is overheating. I think the product has always been over-rated. I might buy it at this price but a simple non electric works just as well at less money."
4,Great product.,This product was actually given as a gift. I gave this to my grandmother. She loves it and says it works well and it was easy to understand what to do. She is so gald to have sharp knifes again.
3,"Bought it, returned it.","This gizmo sounded like a great item to have so I decided to take the plunge and buy one. I was very disappointed. After sharpening one very good knife, I noticed a lot of etching along the blade of the knife - not nice! I cut a tomato with ease, but the next job was a piece of raw meat - I could have gotten further with a butter knife. Maybe it's great if you don't have a steel (most good knives do not need to be sharpened very often, just steeled), but I would prefer to stick with the old method. When one spends $200-$400 for a knife, that etching of which I spoke earlier is not nice. It might be your cup of tea but it left me tepid."
2,Not up to expectation,"Sharpens knives, but slowly, with a lot of vibration, and a razor edge is unattainable. Not much better than my old can opener that had a sharpening stone in a slot on the end."
1,"Lousy, save your money.","Like all other one star reviews I cannot get a sharp edge on our knives with this. I read the instructions carefully and used the technique as stated in the manual. It does take a while to get the hang of it. Just doesn't work. The edges are really ragged and uneven and do not last. I think the ""sharp"" I am feeling is just a bur the sharpener creates along the edge which is quickly flattened during use. I have a few knives it just simply won't put an edge on at all. Period. And I'm talking with about 20 passes on each side. Very disappointed."
3,Chef Choice 300W Sharpener,"It gives a decent edge on the knife, but I wouldn't call it razor sharp like their booklet says. Maybe a three phase sharperner would have been a little more effective."
1,Dull em up,"Should of listen to some of the other reviews, but not me I am to smart. What a pain in the back side. To start you have to make 20 passes of each side of the knife in slot one, then you have to make another 10 passes of each side of the knife in slot two. And you much make them very slow. (Per the owner's manual) It took me hour's to do this and my knife's came out duller then when I stated. What a waste of time. I am glad I bought it from Amazon because they took it back with no question's asked. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Mediocre sharpener,"This is a so-so sharpener. I was hoping it would put a razor sharp edge on my Fibrox knives, but it doesn't do that much more than other sharpeners and in some cases scores the side of the blade. You get what you pay for."
4,Chef's Choice Knife Sharpener,"We had used an electric knife sharpener for about 20 years, but itfinally wore out. Have not used the new one long enough to bereally familiar with it."
4,value,This was a good value. My daughter-in-law want to have sharp knives and I think she will love this sharpener.
5,Works fine - especially after the break-in period,"I've had one of these for 2-3+ years- am extremely pleased. It does take a few cycles to break-in a new knife that needs resharpening - just replaceing the edge that the manufacturer put on it (and I think they say that in their guide). And yes, it takes a bit longer the first few cycles.Now, I can do 7-8+ knives or so (all different sizes) in about 15 minutes - that's not too much time for me. Are they actually 'razor' sharp..... don't know. But they are more than sharp enough for us. I use the old 'paper slice' test. Before resharpening, they barely slice a piece of paper - after sharpening, NO problem (and I only resharpen them every 3-4-5 months or so now).For the price - can't beat it."
2,Disappointing,"I've had mine for several years and have never been happy with it. Despite the magnets, it is difficult to hold the knife ""just right"", especially with knives that are curved toward the tip. And if you don't hold it just right, it chatters violently in the sharpener, which can't be doing the edge any good.Even if you do manage to get this to work the way it's supposed to, the knife's edge is simply not good. It's not terribly sharp, and what sharpness you have added to it is gone in a day or two.Considering the results and the amount of skill required, you're probably better off with an old-fashioned whetstone at 1/10 the price."
4,Skechers & Amazon.com--the Greatest!!,"The shoe is really great--flexible and comfortable. The only reasons I gave them 4 stars and not 5 stars are these: 1) They are a little more pointed than I prefer. 2) The padded footbed is not really very padded. I do like the casual style and their low profile. Amazon.com is just great all around!! The selections are fantastic, and the pricing is fabulous!!!"
5,Service and Product as Promised,The book arrived in record time and was in the condition promised--actuallly in better condition than expected. I would definitely order from this company again.
3,"On the surface, Again","This book just covers the surface of information for 70-291. There are obvious errors in the book. This is the same book as a book listed on Amazon ""Examinsight..."" that cost half of this book. But Insidescoop is suppose to come with a CD. All the other 70-291 books are better. The Trainning kit from Microsoft is the best."
1,i wouldnt buy this again,"I bought one of these cartridges straight from Amazon. It was listed as new but is in fact a refurbished item. I suppose this is common among toner cartridges since they get recycled. This one causes my printer to display ""Toner Low"". Also, it leaks toner so my printer is now a mess inside. I have never had this happen with a name brand cartridge. I give it one star for actually printing. I have emailed Radian support about the false error message and have not gotten a reply in more than a week. Save your money and buy another brand.Later: the cartridge caused my printer to stop working. I can't be sure but it appears that a plastic piece fell off into the works. Stay away from this disaster. Amazon is giving me a refund after I return it."
4,The things you never knew.,The book dispels the cloud of semantical gymnastics over meat. It makes you knowledgeable of what to look for - no matter what it is labeled in the store. It does require a bit of reading but it definitely helps in the purchase and preparation of what benefits us most. It is well illustrated and explained in easily understood terms. You don't have to be a butcher to understand it.
5,professional chef,"I am a chef by trade and I got this book for a good customer who was interested in butchery. It is a well written and didactic book. Beyond that, it is a very interesting read. All the River Cottage Books are great, but they tend to be geared towards British readers so some terminology may be a bit odd for some American readers"
5,Meat man,Excellent information for smallholders like me interested in self sufficiency and organic food production. Fearnley-Whittingstall is my kind of obsessive
5,amazing read!,"I would recommend purchasing any of the river cottage series! the books are extremely well written, and MEAT, in particular, completely changed the way I see food. not only is the book full of information but a moral viewpoint that resonates with the reader long after the book is finished. I am recommending it to all carnivores!"
4,New moral compass,This book and author provide knowledge and insight into a community that I had no idea about.
5,Not your average cook book!,"I rated this book a 5 for many reasons not the least of which is the education I received in the first 190 pages. It describes how you know meat is good, well treated, how a proper butcher should work, etc, etc. Initially I was put off a bit as the theme is never ending. But then I recalled my days as a youth going with my mother to the local butchers and things started to make much more sense. I started over and have revisited that begining 190 many times now.Some complain to British, but I felt it translated well.I was even able to find a local supplier of Heritage Hogs and Lamb, Pasture raised Chickens and Lowline Angus beef to make the best use of the new found knowledge."
2,A history book,"This is a high school level historical account on the development of the ideas of probability (mostly) and statistics, from ancient times to the present. There are the standard bio info of the major characters (where they were born, their parents (ho hum), and some anecdotes on their careers, but all without cited references. Specifically, Tabak claims that Newton said of DeMoivre, ""Go to Mr. DeMoivre; he knows these things better than I do."", which is totally out of character for the lengendarily harsh Newton, whose refusal to attribute any credit to his peers are widely documented. One will not learn any mathematical principles or how to solve problems.And why is Einstein on the cover. He would not be considered among the top 10 giants of this field. Likewise,of all his achievements, probabilty theory, 'probably' would not be among the top 5 (although his work on Brownian motion is covered here), and his oft quoted ""God does not play dice"", notwithstanding."
4,Stivell Remains at the top of his league....,"Alan Stivell, in my judgment, remains one of the most entertaining and satisfying performers of Celtic music."
3,Permatex 81786 Super Clear Vinyl Sealant Repair Kit,"Not especially effective in cementing the vinyl under the final coating. I'd like to find a really good vinyl cement to start the process. The finish looks good, but doesn't have any real strength."
2,Why must I pay extra for a common language like GERMAN?,"If languages like Spanish and French are included in the STANDARD MS Word dictionary, a common language like GERMAN should be included as well. Why do I have to pay extra ($79.95 LIST) for an overly comprehensive dictionary that includes every obscure language, script, and dialect in the world to get a single common language like German? This sems discriminatory!Overall MS ""Proofing Tools"" seems to be a good package, but I feel GOUGED at what I have to pay to get a single additional COMMON language. It would be better if only English was standard in MS Word and if, with each Word license, a buyer could get a free download of one or two common languages of the buyer's choice."
2,grammar check is quite poor,"spell check is good; however, the grammar check is quite poor. There seems to be some problem with the article and adjective check. It rarely offers the correct correction for either."
3,"Beware, you need Word 2003 for it to work","I ordered the 2003 Proofing Tools on the 18th, free shipping. On the 19th I decided I needed it ASAP (and I couldn't update my Amazon order) but it didn't ship until the 22nd. It arrived on the 27th (on schedule) and I found it doesn't work with Word 2002.So, I tried to order the upgrade to Word for 2003 and may have found someone that wasn't sold out after the third try. (Overnite delivery) I can not find the proofing tool for Word 2002, so this has cost me close to $200 so far.I still haven't used the product, but the experience has given me a great headache."
3,Bosch Power Handsaw,"I bought this saw to cut off the bottom of door jambs which this saw does very well. I was very disappointed with the miter box attachment, you have to clamp every piece that you cut and if you don't it vibrates the wood that you are cutting, as a finish carpenter i found this attachment to be worthless, but it did great on the free hand flush cutting. Overall it's worth the money but the miter attachment is going to be collecting dust in the corner of my workshop."
1,rip off,ordered a case of this to only receive it with an experation date for 3 weeks away. very very disappointed
5,Phenominel,"the book was not only interesting, it was touching! there are alot of things people want to know or want to say to people who have passed in our lives, Lizzie made that happen not only for her mother but for her ancestors also, she was there for them. the book gives you a since of hope, hope to see or talk to the pass! beautifully written would love to see a movie!"
5,"Serious, adventuresome reading","It is great to read a book that is simultaneously stimulating and well-written! Perry is a very gifted writer! She holds our attention, keeping us on the edge of our chairs, but does not lose us! One of the best books I've read this year. This author should really get more acclaim. She writes extremely well!"
3,Don't trust Lizzie!,"I think the biggest mistake you can make when reading Stigmata is trusting Lizzie, the main character. The book may be heavily indebted to other works of fiction, but then this is how Lizzie constructs her story. Non of her family history is true, but made up of bits and pieces of stories that have been told before and presented to the reader as original material. The book seems to have many flaws (mixing up of dates etc.). But then these are the hints you get that this is the product of a distorted mind! Lizzie is not a saint but a spoiled brat."
4,"It is a good start, in fact it is brillian","I liked the novel very much, the concept behind it. It is a story about an American-African girl who live three lives... what I like most is who the characters who they were and how they are connected to each other. It is not a complicated story but a very touching.I read the last 2 chapters twice and I wept. It really touched my heart and I felt good with this happy ending.I recommend reading this novel, but it is too slow, it took me two months to finish it. But it worth it.Thanks!"
4,Intriguing....,"Told through a series of flashbacks to various time periods and ancestors interspersed with scenes from Lizzie's present and past, Stigmata is a haunting read. Lizzie, at age 14, inherits her mysterious grandmother's trunk and upon opening it she discovers a quilt that awakens the spirits of the past. Plagued by stigmata of her great-grandmother's wounds from slavery and periodic episodes of memories/time travel, Lizzie is institutionalized for 14 years. She learns to play to game with her psychiatrists and is released to go home under the watchful care of her parents. There she begins to make a quilt to interconnect the generations and provide healing for herself and her family. Stigmata was a quick and easy read for me...it kept me wanting to read it and I'm looking forward to Ms. Perry's next novel."
5,Deluxe Reissue,"Beautiful replica of original gatefold LP cover.Remastering is terrific - warm and natural.This album is a classic that followed upone of the greatest debut albums ever, Careless,which is also available in a deluxe reissue like this one.BISH is almost as strong and durable asCareless was, which is quite amazing.Great songs and performances.Bish's 3rd album (Red Cab To Manhattan) is also wonderful,and was just re-released by Wounded Bird records."
5,Sublime!,"This is a great collection of songs, well-arranged and produced, original, and hooky. One can listen over and over to this collection and find new things to appreciate. Steven Bishop is an excellent songwriter and singer. If you like a good ballad, you will love this album."
3,didnt like it,NOT AS EXCITING AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.I SHARED IT WITH A FEW FRIENDS THEY DIDNT LIKE IT EITHER. A LITTLE ON THE BORING SIDE
4,"Dark Ride It Sure Is, But We've Been On This Ride Before","More or less a rehash of Tobe Hooper's classic The Funhouse, with a group of teens in peril as a maniac returns to his killing grounds for more carnage.What worked back in the 80's because Hooper gave us a very unsettling carnival, works here as well because the theme is dark right from the opening.I like dark themed horrors because they walk that knife edge of the teen slasher flick and very adult content as in anything can happen.So if you enjoyed Funhouse you should like this one even though it's a case of deja vu."
3,A Fun & Campy Dark Ride !,"""Dark Ride"" is definitely one of the better out of the (8 films to die for)bunch. It does live up to it's name. It is a fun & campy dark ride of a slasher filck. There is nothing really different here, it's pretty much your run of the mill slasher fare but the acting is pretty decent and the masked killer was definitely creepy as hell. I did enjoy the disjointed feeling you get throughout the film. It kinda left me wondering if they all participated in the chewing of mushrooms inside the van prior to entering the funhouse. There were some good jumpy moments as well as some absolute ripp-off from other horror film moments but that's to be expected 100% within the sub genre of the slasher film. All & all it's a keeper and with a few more viewings it might even get better."
3,pretty good,This movie was pretty good a lot better than a lot of the recent horror movies that have been released although didn't really live up to the hype when it hit the theatres.
3,If you know what your getting...,"If you want an Oscar worthy film, go look somewhere else. If you like cheesy old 80's horror movies with the same basic plot, and even worse acting, and disgusting gore, then you might want to check this out. The 1st hour is boring but towards the end, once they actually get there, it is great. Like I said, as long as you know what your getting."
4,Great Stuff!,"I can enjoy a movie on many dimensions. Good acting, a good script, genre, can each alone provide ample justification for me to enjoy a movie. More importantly, and less quantifiable, are mood elements, things like filming location, nightime vs daytime, effective use of music, rain, time of year, time period depicted, etc. In this case, the movie is mostly shot in dark settings in a haunted house. Anything having to do with a haunted house is a nearly certain winner for me. And the acting was decent enough that you don't readily notice the problems, and production quality was good too."
2,"It was alright, but certainly nothing new","Dark Ride was definatly like watching an ""R"" rated, ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark?"" episode. It's not really the kind of movie you can get really into, and i found myself fast forwarding to the good parts. Even though the concept was cool and the acting was decent, there just wasn't anything new or memorable about it. Definatly not the best movie in the series, but worth seeing if you're with a hot chick!"
4,Not bad at all...,"I picked up a rental of this at Blockbusters without much thought, assuming it's another one of those low-budget straight-to-video movies. I believe this one actually did make it to theatres. I had no idea at the time since it didn't mention 'After Dark Horror Fest' on the cover. It has lots of decent gore scenes and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, despite the extremely bad acting and slow buildup."
4,Great horror film,"This was a great horror film. Lots of blood and gore, great pictures, and best of all the dude who played Hamiltom Porter in ""The Sand Lot"" and Zach in ""Sun In Law"" is back in this film all grown up as a some what possessed college student. Basically the plot of this movie is a New Jersey board walk horror ride known as ""Dark Ride"" was shot down in the early 1990's, because the person who owned it's oldest son was killing people who rode it. And a group of college students headed for New Orleans for spring break decide to make a stop in New Jersey to spend the night in the Dark Ride. But little do they know that the killer son of the person who owns this ride has just escaped from the mental institute and is also staying inside the dark ride.This film gets 4 stars, because although the plot of it was very creative it still isn't the best thing to come out of A horror movie.This movie also has great special features, I could tell allot of thought went into creating it."
1,I DON'T THINK SO,"I was actually dumb enough to purchase this movie without watching it first. After watching the great FRONTIER(S), BORDERLAND, and MULLBURRY STREET, I figured it would be worth it. I traded this one in right after I watched it.Sure it had that 80's feel to it, but it plainly sucked. I wan't impressed, scared, or uneasy at all. Save your money. It's an after night-school horror flick....But if you want a great couple of movies from the 8 films to die for, check out the ones I mentioned above."
2,Disappointed,"I am so happy I did not waste my money buying this DVD...I rented it for half price at a video store and I have to say it is one of the worst movies I have ever picked up....the idea was great...""killer in the theme park horror ride"" made the movie seem as if it was worth watching because almost everyone has been in a ride like that when they were youngerhowever, the acting was so bad...it was dreadful...and the blonde hitch- hiker made the movie so much worse...she was like ""let's get high"" the ENTIRE moviedont buy this on dvd"
5,Funny!,"A Winner of the Tiptree Award for gender bending science fiction.This is an incredibly funny book about a woman who has a midlifecrisis, splits her personality to become at least four differentpeople, including a gay teenager, a militant churchgoing mother,a brat, and a much put upon bucolic artist, along with the resulting chaosas she turns the town inside out while trying to get her head backtogether."
1,Too much angst,"I bought this after the recommendation of the Triptree committee, and I have to say I was disappointed. I've failed to finish perhaps half a dozen books in my life, but this was one of them. The LeGuin story was much better"
1,bad,Watch kept stoping replaced the battery and it worked for 12 hours then stoped I have returned it to the sell and awaiting a credit to my account.
1,Didnt last more than 3 months,"Installed correctly and used for some time, this ended up failing on us within 3 months past the warranty period. 30 day warranty doesnt cover this so we had to buy again. We chose genuine this time."
2,Tarot Contact,"Some general advice here about self discovery, but degenerates into a tarot style hit and miss."
4,An exellent tool to get to know yourself better in many levels,"I think of this book as a tool to get to know yourself better in many levels!!! Beside reading the book, you have to do some work using the guidance in the book, I think it's worth the effort!!! This book gives you a lot of information and with your own intuition you can find what is your mission in this world. It helps you indentify your weaknesses, and helps you overcome them, It helps empower you to reach your potential!!!"
1,What???,"I am very disappointed that I purchased this audio CD. I can't not even finish it, although I plan to try. The author assumes I have already bought into her hairbrained idea and gets into it too quickly. She is also a terrible speaker and uses the same words too often. She must say fabulous 20 times or more. She needed to get me to buy into her concept before just going right into stating that I met with everyone I am going to meet prior to my birth and agreed to a contract with them. I am just not buying into it in the first CD. I hope to find sometime to actually listen to the rest in case it comes to fruition, but right now I do not consider it worth my time."
2,"Clear writing, but convoluted premise.","I give Caroline 2 stars since she is a talented writer. I have seen her speak and she is much more interesting and engaging than this book would make you think.This book is just so out in left-field for me that I am not able to comprehend WHY anyone would want to know this. I am deeply into eastern thinking, spirituality, self-help, etc. etc. etc. But, this truly is a book which had no connection to me. Not spiritually. Not in any way!I can guarantee you that I made absolutely no CONTRACTS based on any of the archetypes included in this book. Sacred or otherwise!I highly recommend borrowing this from the library prior to commiting to a purchase. If this book somehow connects with you after that, then by all means, buy it. I wish I had done that.I would have never purchased this had I even glanced through the table of contents first."
2,CD needs small booklet of archetypes,"What propmpted me to buy the book was seeing Carolyn on Oprah. I received the book, and it was too much information to get thru for me, so I returned it. I then, ordered the CD version and enjoyed it very much, until the 4th CD suggests you need the book to determine what archetypes you are. Seems to me the CD should have a mini booklet on archetypes to accompany it. I am so disappointed now, I'm returning the CD too. I don't think I should have to buy the book and CD to understand something simple like this."
1,don't waste your money,Unfortunately Myss uses her talent as a medical intuitive to seem ‘all knowing’. This book is full of theories and speculation. A medical intuitive is no more enlightened and closer to the truth than a person who can change a car tire. Both are abilities and do not make you right about spiritual matters. So on what grounds to we base her authenticity? Well I have none. My own intuition steered me away from this book but I didn’t listen unfortunately.This book fails to perform what Myss promises in the beginning and is very boring.
4,Excellent Overview for Self-Understanding,"This is a review of the audio CD versionI've always been baffled as to why certain types of events or lessons keep confronting me. Myss' work, based on a healthy does of Jungian psychology, is that humans are made up of various standad and non-standard archetypes and it is through these frameworks that we view life and develop our personalities.When she says that there is a reason why things keep recurring, the reasons being there is a lesson in there somewhere, she speaks authentically. That idea made sense for me.While the audio is a nice explanation of here theories, there aren't any exercises for development or to take action. That is why I give the audio 4 stars. There are exercises in the book, which I recommend buying along with the audion."
2,"Reader From Reading, PA","I read alot of spiritual books but this one I could not get into. I don't feel it had anything inspiring or worthwhile to say about sacred contracts, I was just bored and got nothing out of it, I was kinda dissapointed I thought it sounded like a great book to read."
5,Wonderful book for the spiritual seeker.,Jungian psychological archetypes combined with Metaphysical spiritual philosophy are the core of Sacred Contracts. It is an excellent book helping us to find the deeper meaning of the soul's purpose through the archetypical characters she presents in this book. Sacred Contracts illustrates the deeper meaning of behaviors and patters that formulate the very essence of who we are as spiritual and human beings. It helps us to understand how the choices we make give our life meaning or lack of it. This book helps to show how what we experience in life should be guided and governed through a spirit-mind-body connection instead of a mind-body-spirit connection.
4,Help in Understanding Archetypes,"Because many of us are raised and educated in the West, it is often hard to make that shift into seeing both the physical and spiritual realities. This is why I enjoy reading books by some authors from other cultures because they sometimes have a better way of explaining it. Myss does a good job in explaining what archetypes are. They are personalities but people from all over the world have called them spirits, angels, etc. They exists within and outside of our being. Myss helps one to see this and recognize their presence in literature, other people, our enemies and in our life. While trying not to sound too religious, she ties them into the horoscope. I am not too fond of the system but she does an excellent job in helping one to understand really what archetypes are."
3,step 2: Intuition focus - HELP !!!!!,"As I was reading the instructions of the cards/game, I made a mistake. In the step 2 it says shuffle the 2 dekes of cards. I did that, and only after words I saw the rest of the instructions where says soon after it was writen to shuffled them. It said being careful to keep them separate. However, It was already too late for me...I would like to know which cards are supposed to be in the 2 deckes, so that I can put them in the 2 dekes...Please, help me, so that I can continue playing the game... and finding out about my archetypes!!!! Thank you!!!!"
5,MUST HAVE! MUST READ! MUST APPLY!,If I were on a desert island and told I could have only one book this would be it.
2,"""MYSS"" alot of details",If I can ask for a refund I will. the book gives a list of archetypes which didn't really make sense to me. The most disappointing was trying to make up my chakra wheel. I just wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I didn't get anything useful or enlightening out of it.
2,Where is the Power for Doing?,"We all know what we need to do. Some of us know it better than others, but we all have a certain amount of self-knowledge and a certain understanding of our place in the world.Caroline Myss seems to think a more perfect understanding of yourself would help you be a better person and to better fulfill your purpose in life. But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your ""sacred contract"". Self-knowledge is not the same as power, in the same way as a driver's manual is no help if you don't have gasoline in your car."
2,book too mixed up,"I found this book mixed up in its presentation. The matter was not presented clearly in a logical sequence, it jumped here and there. I had to flip back and forth. The archetypes should have been listed in the chapter that pertained to them, instead of being stuck in the back of the book. Some of this book is divination, and I won't participate in it. I bought this book because someone saw it on Oprah and told me about it. I thought that it would help me. I did learn of the different archetypes that I am, and that helped me some to identify the things that I do. It was even painful to read about the archetypes and realize which ones that I was. I would have finished the book, but I won't participate in divination, as the exercise at the end is compared to the Tarot, or I Ching."
1,"Theology, not spirituality","I saw the interview that the auther did on Oprah, which inspired me to purchase this book. Unfortunately, the book had little to do with the archetypes that were discussed during the interview and very much to do with the divine. This book should really be categorized as religion. The author makes use of this book to pedantically express her theological point of view. Sadly, it is little more than religious propaganda."
3,Intriguing and somewhat disappointing,"This author has an interesting way of looking at the world, and gives us a few hints to how to see what she sees. We are also treated to insight into the lives of various religious and political leaders of history.That's very interesting, but aside from doing a philosophical exploration, what do I do with it? I expected a lot more guidance in finding my own ""sacred contract."" Maybe it's in there, but I didn't find it."
3,Not as Compelling or Interesting,"I finished reading Caroline Myss' book and actually forced myself to finish the last several pages. Though I did sit down and do a 'Wheel' of Archetypes, and learned more about myself I grew tired of her analysis of others' and their wheels. I got to the point, I didn't care any more. Previously I enjoyed her personal stories in 'Anatomy of Spirit' and in 'Invisible Acts of Power' though she repeated stories and it is best to avoid that pitfall. I am less inclined to buy any more of her books as I feel she is cashing in on her popularity. Time to step back and take a break. Liz-Roy Broerse"
4,Good Book,A little hard to understand at times but overall a good read. I heard about it on an Oprah show.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I feel it is a waste of my money to have purchased this book. Although this book make references to many religions and beliefs some are taken out of context, in my humble opinion; therefore makes it hard for me to continue. Since I bought the book I am continuing to read it; but it is with great reluctance. However for those who are thinking of purchasing this book, I suggest you first read a few chapters in the bookstore or library, if you think it will help you, then go for it."
3,Too long - needs to be edited further,"This book could have been edited more severely to make it about 30% shorter without compromising the content. I ran out of enthusiasm by the end of it. I couldn't see the point in placing your main archetypes into a house system similar to astrology. I found the section at the back where some of the different archetypes are described the most valuable part of the book as it prompted self-analysis. I also bought the archetype cards and used them in conjunction with the archetype descriptions at the back of this book, although a small guide to archetypes comes with the cards themselves, so this book is not an essential companion to the cards."
4,Sacred Contracts,"I found the instructions VERY confusing and credit my own combination of intuition and analytic skills for being able to make any sense of them!! However, if you get through the instructions -- Sacred Contracts is an interesting merger of Jungian archetypes and astrology. Worked with slowly and contemplatively I find that the system can reveal some valuable, occasionally jaw-dropping insights. As with most things, it's what we bring to it that makes it work or not."
3,Sacred Contracts,"""Sacred Contracts"" is a strong book dealing with medical intuition and offers advice dealing with metaphysical disease. I think the archetypes would be even more effective if they were leaning towards using terminology about the diseases and their links with medical intuition. If you loved the part about archetypes and astrology, you definitely want to purchase the book ""Discoverning Your Soul Mission"" by Linda Brady and Evan St. Lifer. An excellent book using karmic astrology to create the life you want! Linda Brady's classess has certainly helped me find my ""Soul's Mission!"" Dr. Marilyn R. Lee"
5,An excited Customer,"I purchased this book, after reading Entering the Castle. I am very excited about the spiritual renewal that is taking place. Thanks Amazon for making this material available."
5,Sacred Contracts (audio),"Dr. Myss, in my 'I' has always been the closest in perception that I've believed in for the past 30 years. Her latest, Sacred Contracts, is such a tool, blessed to give the reaching souls on this earth plane, a chance to understand so much of their spiritual journey, meaning and purpose, acceptance and comprehension of life's fantastic voyage. I salute her, and chosen spirits like her, Gary Zukav, Oprah (let's not forget her), and to say bravo to all of them, for the world is in such a place of 'be'ing that wisdom is the understatement of what IS. You can listen and re-listen to these tapes, and each time, find another part of the Whole.......being us all."
2,Confusing,"I found Ms. Myss' latest book confusing. She has an appendix in the back listing many the archetypes and descriptions of each. However, in the text of the book she refers to archetypes which aren't included in the appendix, i.e. hermit, dilettante, sage, wizard, etc. These seem to be plucked from nowhere, with no description as to attributes similar to the format in the appendix. Why aren't all the archetypes she discusses in the appendix? And since they aren't, the book failed for me. M. Koller, Tucson"
5,"A point of view, authoritive","Based on what we all have to ponder at least once in our lives, are we here for a mission or purpose? If so this author has a very authoritive stance at what we are and what we should do. Her opinion yes, but with an immense amount of research from various spiritual origins. There is absolutely no basis for evolution in this book. The info presented is not so biased as from the author, but from the belief of Sacred origins. With that this book has rigid guidelines and rigid classes of being, leaving the only weakness to this write, being restricted or less dimensional than real life actually unfolds. This is a complicated read at the same time, however leaves much room for simple universal expansion.I strongly recommend a book that is easy reading, and does not limit our origins or options, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox."
2,Touchy feely mumbo jumbo,I am a down to earth person who sets and achieves my goals. This book did not give me anything tangible or practical to use in the real world.
2,A Confusing Mish-Mosh of a System. . . .,"Not a poorly written book by any means, this book's ""system"" for self-discovery is a complicated mish-mosh of Chakra, Astrology, and Jung, with a few groovy wheels and charts thrown in to assist in analysis.There are certainly simpler ways to discover one's ""calling"" than to put oneself through the rigors of the steps outlined in this book. Approach this book with caution and only if you've got a lot of time on your hands."
3,Not the best place to start with this author,"I confess I had never heard of Dr. Myss until very recently. This recording was available from my library as an mp3 download, so I thought I'd check her out (pun not intended, but it does fit). Here are my impressions:I hadn't realized, until later in the program, that one was supposed to be familiar with the archetype subject matter beforehand (from reading her book). I was able to appreciate the program, but would urge those of you who haven't listened yet to get a grasp of the archetype concept first - you'll be glad you did. The last part concerns her ""wheel"" tool: archetypes (not-so-subtly) morph in astrological signs.In the course of these four hours, there are regular references to objects, gestures, etc. onstage that are lost on audio. I've listened to other, similar seminar recordings where this hasn't been a problem, but here it is noticeable when it occurs."
3,Thought Provoking,"I just completed the audiotapes of the book yesterday. This was my first experience with any of Carolyn's work. Her spoken words were thought provoking and in many ways motivating. I feel that I learned a few new pieces of information which complement my existing beliefs. I was however disappointed that the publishers??? chose not to include a small booklet with the archetypes etc. One feels forced to purchase the book in order to complete the exercises which are discussed on the tapes. I resent this sort of marketing and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth! On the lighter side however, I would recommend the audio tapes for anyone who seeks a thought provoking discussion of the seemingly ""passing"" relationships and chaos of daily life. I have gained new awareness as a result of listening to the tapes and that is, in and of itself, noteworthy to any future buyers."
3,weight watchers here I go...,if your really want to know why you are FAT...go to weight watchers..this whole book is a knock off of a weight watchers session..it jus an ok book.
4,Great Cheap Toaster,"This toaster does its job very well. It toasts breads of all sizes and types including buns. It doesn't have any flashy features, it just works. Feels solidly built and of good quality for the price. Happy toasting!"
1,Warning!,"Do not use this on good stainless flatware with a shiny finish -- you will end up with a brushed stainless piece instead. I followed the directions carefully, skipping the coarsest pad and keeping it wet, but it ruined the piece I used it on. Too bad. I was really hoping to remove the fine scratches my flatware has gotten over time, even though I only hand wash it."
5,FANTASTIC,"This CD is beautifully crafted by the son of the greatest reggae star ever . Yes Peter Tosh taught Bob Marley everything he knew about how to create reggae tunes . The music althhough not original still has the vibration of Tosh's soulfull feeling . True Andrew is not the artist that his dad was but there is enough of his dads influence to satisfy those of us who truly thirst for more of his music . Great musicians roll out a tight weave of Tosh's best known songs . I loved this CD the previous reviewer needs to get real and give it up for this tribute album by Peter's son , Andrew ."
1,Wrong product information and samples,"For all the people wanting to listen to this CD in Spanish, beware because all songs except one are sang in Portuguese. There is another version of this CD which may be sang in Spanish as it says."
4,Great Book For Non-Maths Types Who Need A Grasp of Stats,Statistics for social sciences/humanities is actually much more interesting and useful than those stats used in the physical sciences.But it must be explained clearly first before the social scientists/humanitists can start to use it productively.This is no job for some Professor of Statistics; it's one for a person who's had to bust the formal jargon down to everyday commonsense ideas for themselves.Coolican has clearly got himself up to a decent level of understanding of all the usual statistical tests used in psychology and related fields. His writing style is simple and friendly without losing lucidity.I'd recommend this book for anyone not too familiar with maths since school.
4,Excellent,Monster has lived up to their brand. I use it for video connection from VCR to my Onkyo receiver and works flawlessly.
4,Must Read book,"This book gives a fare Idea about the new security model. It gives some what inside view, which might be helpfull when we are developing.But I have feeling that,this is more like specification"
3,Simple coverage,"This uninspired coverage of the Security API is a real disappointment considering that it comes from Sun. The Security API is not trivial and the 150 pages that cover Security API classes are not sufficient to provide the in-depth analysis needed to understand and manipulate the API. This book is a good overview of the Security API. There are some good general security discussions, and some historical perspectives on why the API is designed the way it is. I read this book after reading the O'Reilly security book which is much more thorough."
2,"A complete coverage, but very complex and bad organized book","In fact this book is a complete coverage of the java security.It is true, that the subject is quite complex and needs concentrationto be understood perfectly. However I believe this books lacks suitable examples.In my personal point of view, providing sufficient clear examples in a book,will help the reader to understand better the subject.I didn't find this important quality in this book.If somebody wants to buy a book about Java security, thismeans that he/she didn't understand completely the whole subject, justby reading the API on Sun web site and therefore he/she is looking fora better source of information that illustrates the subject in a moreconvenient and clear way. Unfortunately this book, although completein the coverage of the topics, is too far a way to be considered as a clearand easy understanding book, particularly, for those who are not alreadyseniors in Java security."
2,Some good coverage with problems,"For someone who is trying to get a grasp of a complicated subject, this books is too difficult to read. The author's numerous citations were impressive, but again I thought got in the way of the subject. The book needs real world examples. To make matters worse, there were a number of errors, especially with the illustrations, which made it even more difficult to follow."
1,Thoroughly Disappointing,"A work of exceptionally poor quality - an editorial disaster that is an insult to the reader. To date, the Java Series has been very impressive indeed. The otherwise outstanding team at Sun is let down very badly by this effort."
4,A Confederate soldier's story:,"Private Edgar Warfield of the 17th Virginia Infantry starts his amazing story with the jovial and enthusiasm attitude shared by many Southern recruits embarking for a chance to fight off the Union stranglehold forming in early 1861. This newfound bundle of patriotic spirit is quickly humbled by the baptism of fire. Warfield is involved in many skirmishes and battles such as 1st Manassas, Seven Pines, 2nd Manassas, Sharpsburg and more. His descriptions or movements are a bit hard to follow though his story of daily camp life is excellent. The details of fighting and others in battle is a bit `matter of fact' at times though he does share his opinions on subjects as comrades dying or being injured. His story is rather quick as there are 180 pages of material that he has put together. This book is a valuable asset for understanding soldier life and how one perceived war."
3,Atlas of rheumatology,"Good atlas, however it got here in poor condition, for a new book.I BOUGHT IT AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT for my daughter. She has not seeing it yet. It she does not approve of the condition I will have to return it. Dr Melendez"
4,Offshoring IT a good source about out source,"A rather decent collection of thoughts, observations and study about the issues of IT projects over global distribution. It is a good source of reading to get a background on the true advantages and pitfalls one can face in offshoring. I enjoyed the read and it makes you better prepared to face the challenges or perhaps to understand the ones you are already in. The perspective does not all come from one source as the author has help writing and you get opinion as global as the topic. That in itself is well worth the read because it helps the US based reader understand how to see others and to see yourself!"
3,Horrible sound,"I bought this for an independent study graduate class. It seemed as though it would be exactly what I needed with the video's of the case studies and the refelctions on those lessons. Part of the problem with this book was that I had no idea it was the school administration for professional development workshops. So a lot of the refelctions were more about how to teach inquiry, not the importance of it. Overall it was very interesting to watch. However, the sound was so horrible on the last 2 videos I had to just turn it off and read the scripts. There were captions on half the videos and they should have been on all of them. I spent more time trying to read what they were saying because I couldn't understand it, that I missed most of the video. I am not entirely convinced that the video's were needed either, since the camera rarely moved to the person that was talking in several videos.If there is a newer version of this with better sound, it may be useful."
1,Hot flashes came back!,This only has 40 mg of black cohosh. I had used maximum strength Estroven that had 80 mg of black cohosh - hot flashes were reduced to 2 at night. Started using this multi-vitamin Estroven - hot flashes increased to 8-10 per night. Don't like this version at all!!! Not worth it.
2,"Beware, Not as Advertised....","Beautiful comforter, however is it not reversable. Both the reverse side & bedskirt are cream colored. Also there is no cord piping on the comforter. Mine is being returned."
2,What you see is NOT what you get!,"Buyer beware!! The product that you will receive is not at all what is advertised. I have returned this comforter twice and have now been told that they will not be able to supply me with the advertised product. What's worse is the insert that is inside the packaging of the comforter is the same as what is displayed on this site, but when you open it up you will see it is thin, not reversable and MAYBE worth the 30 bucks you pay for it."
1,Not happy!,"Mine is stuffed in the closet in the corner. Not very soft maybe could be put in a guest room that is never used. My bed skirt was so flimsy, the seam ripped the same day I got it. I wouldn't bother."
2,Just not right,"I mean you get what you pay for, but this is just a different product in the package than as shown. At least for the King Size set, you do NOT get the stripes, you get a plain dust ruffle and shams worthy of sandpaper(ok I exaggerate, but they are purely for decorative display and NOT for sleeping).All in all for Under 20 bucks it isn't worth the hassle of returning. Oh and all the people are correct in stating the comforter states dry clean only.I am a little upset that amazon hasn't corrected this issue with at least a disclaimer saying item may not be as pictured or described."
3,Fun for the kids,"Expect this to be for the kids, very nice for a first video camera experience, small, compact.Not a professional camera but a good way to introduce the kids to using one."
4,Nice smart movie,"I heard of FINDING BLISS after hearing a Q&A; on the creative screenwriting podcast and was interested enough to import it.Often I import indie movies and they really disappoint - but this film I really enjoyed. There are slight problems, but I know from hearing the Q&A; this was down to budget/time limitations, and anyway they are small niggles. If this had been written by and directed by a man there'd be an outcry against it - but written and directed by a woman? I thought it was pretty fresh, brave and funny, and it's a shame it didn't get a bigger audience."
3,Lost and found,"Leelee Sobieski is a would-be filmmaker who can't get funding to make her dream script, but (though the usual contrived situations) gets a job editing porn movies and then...you can pretty much work out every plot beat from there. It follows its formula with energy and really believes in itself, but it will never surprise you."
4,Offbeat fun,"Others have covered the plotline quite well, so I'll just say that I saw this in its brief theatrical run and thoroughly enjoyed it. That said, I would be particular as to whom I would recommend it. Set in the porn industry, it's certainly not for the conversative viewer or those who are uncomfortable with the subject of sex, dealt with in an adult and fairly explicit way. Nice performances by some of my favorite actors, although I wish the likeable Jamie Kennedy's character was less moronic, to the point where he seems borderline mentally disabled."
2,"Mediocre Coffee, Mysterious Leaks","I have had this coffee maker for about 6 months. The main problem with it is the quality of the coffee. We have tried many different brands of coffee, but all taste very mediocre. We also need to use more coffee in the filter than usual or the coffee tastes weak. Another annoying problem is intermittent leaking from the filter basket if the coffee pot and filter are not aligned perfectly. Even when I think the filter basket is all the way in, it still leaks sometimes, not sure why.On the positive side, it makes a pot of coffee fairly quickly, looks nice, and the timer works as expected. I guess it is not bad for the price, but next time I would spend a little more for better tasting coffee."
1,ditto on the leaks,I am shopping for a new coffee maker now because I have this one and it leaks. I have experienced the mysterious puddle of coffee under the unit. Somehow the coffee gets diverted between the brew basket and the pot and ends up on the counter.
3,Don't bent down,"I bought this case, because the lether case was not good enough and I thought this one will be better, but, it was not. The secure lock is not secure at all and it is easy to open. The rest is okay, you need to be very carefull, specially if you have some extra pounds like me, and you stomach (sides) will touch it... LOL..."
2,Sloppy,"The idea behind this book is good - prepare for the essay exam by actually writing essays. The book gives a great approach for how to read problems, digest the facts, organize, and then actually write your answers. The model answers answers and grading rubrics, however, are limited in their usefulness by numerous errors. There are factual errors in the answers (assuming facts not stated or outright misstatements), legal errors in the answers (incorrect statements of law), and grading rubrics that don't apply to the problem or are inconsistent with the written explanation of what the bar examiners are looking for. The error rate is high - of the 13 problems I've worked through from different sections in the book, 3 had at least one of these errors! Such a high error rate is disappointing, especially considering the copyright notice says this is a 2011 version of book initially published in 1995."
1,A waste of money,"This book is a waste of money. It says there are over 100 essays but they are NOT all california past essays and I'm not sure if any of them are, maybe a couple are but not recent ones thats for sure. They are from different bar exams and some use the wrong terminology. The exam answers are horrible? If you did that on a bar exam with like no law no elements no proper rules you would get all 50s?Its so ridiculous, any of the people who gave those 5 star reviews clearly work for Bar Breaker.The advice in here is good like to keep motivated and stuff but otherwise Mr. Adachi owes me 100$."
1,"It's neither jiu jitsu, nor is it for the streets","this is one of the worst videos on real world combat i've seen. the techniques reviewed are very basic and, frankly, unrealistic for a street-fight situation. i just think Simco doesn't have much to teach in this area (or in jiu jitsu in general).if you are serious about no-holds-barred fighting, you are much better off getting the 'secrets of chute boxe' by the Rua brothers, who are accomplished NHB practitioners and reasonably good teachers. for the disarming techniques and standing submissions, you are better off with a krav maga video, such as any in the 'Combat Survival' series."
2,Nice Attempt but Naive and Cliche,"As a youth living on Long Island, I can often understand Hollander's ambition to write about the suburbs and how ""wierd"" it supposely is. However, in my humble, yet cynical opinion, Hollander fails in originality and is extrememly shallow. He offers no new perspectives about the suburbs and makes no bold statements. When I heard there was a book written about Long Island, and in particular Suffolk County I was thrilled. But I'm so dissappointed. Now, it is up to me."
3,On the road to nowhere,"Basically, this novel is a stream of related short stories, and they get more and more metaphysical. The prose has youthful vigor, and Hollander captures the quality of life on Long Island -- unless you're rich and well-educated, Long Island is a dead end; hard to get off of, yet easy to leave. The central romance between the lead male character, a budding, if lazy, bureaucrat, and his girlfriend is affecting. In one hilarious bit, a group of characters finds a car stereo predicting the group's immediate future. These works are certainly promising, but Hollander needs to marshal his talents and focus them to greater literary effect; his themes here -- yeah, modern life's a drag if you don't have an education and your parents were abusive or stuck -- are shallow. But I'd buy his next book."
3,"Not a ""Hand Strap"" in the usual way.","It's a short strap that you hold with your hand instead of around your neck. It's not to steady your grip while shooting.I use it with a DSLR Holster just to hoist the camera out of the bag. A neck strap is too much to stuff in around the camera each time I put it away.I plan to have aPeak Design Capture Camera Clip PEAKCAMCLIPinstalled on the bag strap to hang the camera on during shooting.The build is on the cheap side, but I think it will last under light use."
1,Hand strap? HAHAHA more like neck strap,"I am 100% dissatisfied with this ""hand"" strap. How can they even market this as a hand strap?I have a full size canon 50D with full battery grip, and this thing is still WAY TOO BIG to even consider it a hand strap. It is awful.I will be returning mine ASAP.I would almost consider this false advertising it is so bad. There's not a single person in the world with a hand that big.Do NOT buy this for a camera!"
4,A lot but not all,"As a Caterina Valente fan of many years, almost from the very beginning of her singing career, I was also interested in finding out more about the person behind the singer. This book shows a lot of details, that hitherto were not available in any other source, but unfortunately glosses over periods that may bear sad memories for Caterina Valente. It would have been interesting to know more about the war years, the beginning of her recording career and the concert tours. However, as told by herself, the book provides a lot of information and reveals the person behind this superb singer to a great extent. It ought to be together with all her recordings in every Caterina Valente fan's home."
5,Black and Decker 18 v charger,Seems to work much faster than original chargerBlack & Decker FSMVC 9.6-Volt to 18-Volt Slide Style Battery Charger
2,Returned product,I returned this product.I have not recieved credit on my VISA card. When will this happen. I sent it PriorityMail. When will the refund occur.
4,Good Product,"The charger was as advertised and it appers to work well enough. I bought it to replace the charger which was included with the Black & Decker Fire Storm Drill Kit, which failed within a few months of use. Hope this model charger will last a little bit longer."
4,18V Slide Style Battery Charger,"Waiting to see if this charger really can keep NiCAD style batteries from developing a ""memory"" from incorrect charging techniques which this charger is supposed to prevent. Get in touch w/me in a year after I have had a chance to really put it to use."
4,Works,"Product works very nicely w/ 12 Volt rechargable battery. Super fast, charges my drill 3-4 times faster than stock drill charger. Don't pass on this one."
1,It does NOT work! The batteries DO NOT FIT!,"We bought this charger for 18v batteries that are used with many B&D tools like the blower, edger, etc. It is the ""standard"" battery and most commonly used with this charger. None of our three identical batteries would even FIT in this thing! It's made incorrectly! Ironically, we went to Lowe's and bought THE SAME CHARGER in the SAME PACKAGING and it works perfectly. We suspect this was a ""copy"" made somewhere other than where the others are made. Don't buy it because it won't fit the batteries!"
5,Battery Chaeger,This charger was priced better than the original. This charger really works great. The charger saved me from having to replace a battery.
2,Black & Decker FSMVC 9.6-Volt to 18-Volt Fast Charger,"I have two 14.4 volt batteries that were working properly when my previous charger melted. Both batteries are receiving the quick blinking light (defective battery) within 5 minutes of placing in charger. I cannot believe that both batteries are defective just from changing chargers. I am not pleased with this charger as now I'm not sure if the charger damaged the batteries; or the batteries are actaully defective. Without purchasing another battery or charger, I will never know."
2,Newer 9.6-24v charger available,"A newer 9.6-24v charger is available and fit the 18v slide battery chargereven through they list it as only for the string trimmer and hedge trimmers.""Black & Decker BDFC240 9.6 Volt to 24 Volt Battery Charger For NST1024 String Trimmer And NHT524 Hedge Trimmer"""
5,Much better than the original,"Had a couple of the old slide style chargers, both of which have gone out. This was worth the money just to test the 4 batteries I have (2 w/ kit, 2 from a garage sale that were of unknown condition). Has instructions on the unit and makes it much more clear as to condition and charge of the battery. Also quicker."
5,Battery charger,all features works as indicated more than satisfiedBlack and Decker PS1MVC 8.4-Volt to 14.4-Volt 1 Hour Pod Style Battery Charger
3,Black and Decker Firestorm battery charger,"So far this product has performed as advertised. I am extremely satisfied with the drill motors themselves and have purchased other tools utilizing the same 18 volt battery. So far, all 4 of the chargers that have come with these tools has failed and failed quickly. That is why I offer the caveat 'so far' (1 month of use)"
3,Does NOT fit all 9.6V-18V B&D Batteries,I gave the item only 2 stars to make sure potential buyers are aware that this charger does not fit all 9.6V-18V Black and Decker batteries. It has slots for 3 charging prongs. Check your battery before ordering. The item cannot be returned for credit or refund according to Amazon.com.
1,Defective-Wouldn't charge an 18volt battery.,I was throughly unhappy with this purchase. I would not recommend this charger. It would only charge up to 9.6 volts then stop. I have an 18 volt Black & Decker batteries. I found this unit completely useless.
5,It works,I used all the recharging methods Black and Decker supplied with its drills. Nothing seemed to work and I think I might have disposed of working batteries when it was the re charger. This one works and very quickly. Anyone with B&D batteries that are this spec need this charger
3,No NiMH,"This battery charger works well for NiCd batteries. However, the directions specifically state that battery packs that are labeled NiMH should only be used with chargers that are labeled NiMH or NiCd/NiMH."
4,Better than standard charger,Works much better than the standard black and decker charger.Much faster and provides a complete charge.Good value for the price.Quick shipping.
1,[ ... ],Works great for one battery if you have three hours and no other batteries. The Lithium batteries that come with the BD trimmer are useless. I would have been better off with a cord or gas trimmer. The batteries last about 5 min and die quickly after.BD has lost me as a customer.
5,Works great!,"Reasonably priced, quick delivery, great product. I am pleased with the performance of the charger. It works very well. Just as described."
1,NOT AVAILABLE,If I had known that this item was back logged for months I would not have purchased the other items that it went with.
5,Black & Decker universal battery charger,this thing works very well I like it better than the one that came with their equipment originally. I have used it several times with no problems and would recommend it to others
5,"Great product, shame I had to buy it.","I had purchased a Black & Decker weed trimmer last year which runs on 18v recharagables. Go to charge the batteries this summer, and they would not charge. Did some research online, seems everyone has the same problem with the charger they include with the weed trimmer, its cheap and fails often. So I ended up purchasing this one, as it is the only one that gets positive reviews. Worked like a charm. Shame I had to buy it, I shouldn't expect the charger they include to fail after a year."
5,An Absolute Must Have!,"If you own a slide style Black & Decker battery then you need this charger! For years I used the basic chargers that came with the tools that I purchased. I had to set a timer to make sure that I wasn't going to ""cook"" the batteries and I never knew when the batteries were fully charged. This charger is excellent because it lets you know when it is done charging. Also, you don't have to worry about ""cooking"" the batteries because of it's ability to not overcharge. Another feature that I like is that it will tell you if a battery is ruined, letting you know that it's time to recycle it. I have been impressed with the speed of the charger and have not used my old chargers since buying this one!"
5,Black And Decker battery charger,I was worried the battery would not be adaptable to he charger but was pleasently surprised. It fit like a glove and seemed to charge extremely fast.The orange color stands out nicely among my forest of black or silver chargers. It seems to be built rugged as I am not very easy on ecquipment. I GIVE THIS CHARGER A THUMBS-UP.
4,Good all-in-one charger for Black and Decker,"I have many black and decker products, new and old, drill charger quit and bought this. This not only worked well, but faster and I now use it for all the decker products, a kind of a one stand charging unit to save space and keep the mess and wife off my back."
1,bad,the add said it would charge all slide style batteries but it does not work on my 18-volt slide style battery HPB18 powder pack for my black & decker drill.
1,Does not charge all slide style batteries,"I bought this because it says that it will charge all slide style batteries. Well, it doesn't. There are some slide style batteries that have a different plug style. Black and Decker has ignored my question regarding the product and I can't locate the appropriate charger. I'm currently sending this one back. The product may be a good product, assuming that you have the right type of battery."
3,"It works, but not fast","I have two of these chargers, and while they both work, I'd hesitate to call them ""fast"". A fully discharged battery can take several hours to recharge. Compare this with other vendors' products, which can recharge in as little as 45 minutes."
3,BEWARE! MSRP is really $30 - NOT $49.60 as shown by Amazon,"The MSRP shown on Amazon for this product as of this review is $49.60 (selling for $29.88) and says you save $19.72 (40%). (Ships from and sold by Amazon.com).Not sure where they are getting this MSRP from as Black & Deckers website shows the MSRP of $30.So you're actually saving 12 cents over MSRP and not the $19.72 they claim you are.Word of caution as I see this on lots of products, over and over again!I couldn't post the URL to Black & Deckers site for this product because my review was not approved, sorry."
5,Great Recharger,"I was concenred about spending close to $30 on this recharger. Let me tell you: it's worth it. The charge is faster and the battery lasts much longer when working it hard. Night and day difference from the standard charger the batteries ship with. I have a grasshog weed wacker, and need to use it about 45 minutes straight on my lot each week here in Florida. So, I use the batteries big time. I have 4 batteries and 2 chargers. The light blinks when charging and then is always on when totally charged. Nice feature. If you need to recharge rarely, it's not worth it. If you use your batteries alot, it is well worth it."
4,Honest work but ....,"I do not think this book is substantially different or better than what's already out there at an intermediate level for engineers. (e.g Lorrain's Electromagnetic Fields or Rao's Elements of Engineering EM or Johnks book). It does discuss optical dielectric filters and the matrix method for analyzing thin films in more detail than other E&M; books (but no better than any standard optics text). It is also reasonably complete in its topics. I would recommend Inan's book except that his Engineering level book does not cover oblique incidence of waves (only normal) or dielectric waveguides. He placed that in a 2nd electromagnetic waves book.If you do not mind buying and paying for two books, I also feel Inan's books are really well done."
1,horrible all the way around,"wish i had known how shoddy the film was before i bought the season. my bad. but seriously, i felt as if it were shot in the 70's with dialog my teenager wrote."
5,Guilty pleasure,Season 2 is good but Season 1 is great. A fun show to own and watch again and/or share with friends.
5,Love Billie Piper,"I first saw Billie Piper in an episode of ""True Love"". Her acting abilities are stellar. I bought this series, because I wanted to see her act in other things and wasn't disappointed. Then I looked on YouTube and saw some of her first music videos. It is hard to believe it is the same girl. Very talented!! Triple threat!"
2,Main character rather repellant,"After buying/watching two episodes, I felt I'd rather not throw good money after bad. There seemed to be no connection to the main character, and while that may have been by design (because of the work she does as a call girl, she's not the kind of person to let people in emotionally), it wasn't a show I wanted to watch further."
4,Enjoyed season 1 - why doesn't AIV have 3 available yet?,"I am a Whovian fangirl and I loved Rose, Billie Piper's character in Doctor Who, so much that I became a true fan of Billie the actress. I made it through season 1 quickly because it was a fun and different series and I enjoyed the story line. I would say it's more of a novelty type of show - not one I recommend to any uptight or prudish friends!I would love to watch the rest of the series on Amazon Instant Video but I am only able to purchase 1 episode at a time of seasons 2 & 4 instead of the entire season at once... AND why isn't season 3 on AIV?"
4,It's the girl from Dr. Who,"Product as advertised, good price and it looks good. It is a good story that shows her assets and acting ability. I recommend this product."
3,Just okay,"I did somewhat enjoy this series. A nice peek into the life of a sex worker. I like how there is equal focus on both the drawbacks and the positives of being a call girl. Billie Piper is a gem. I disliked the actor that played the best friend; what a bore!I also hated the lighting in most of the episodes. Is it supposed to look like a soft porn set? Perhaps so, but the lighting could be improved on to give a more modern and hip feel.All in all, not bad, will move on to the next season solely on Billie Piper's performance. Thank god it is roughly 20 minutes per episode."
5,SUPERB Entertainment!,"If you like cutting edge entertainment that leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat, your brain fully sated, then Secret Diary of a Call Girl is for you. The lead actress, Billie Piper has put herself into this 110% that you are SURE she truly is a high class call girl.I have a good friend who in America, is a high class call girl, and I just wonder WHY they don't make it LEGAL and safe for the women. As long as they turn the other cheek, and make it illegal, they make it unsafe for the girls..But that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed season one!The reviewer, Dear Miss Mermaid, is the author of ""HURRICANES & HANGOVERS (and other tall tales and loose lies from the coconut telegraph)"
4,Great toaster - many super features!,"I have this same toaster, except in the 4-slice model. I am very happy with it. It is very easy to keep clean - and the crumb tray is SO easy to clean. No more opening little metal doors on the bottom of your toaster and dumping it upside down over the sink to get the crumbs out. The crumb tray on this Sunbeam model just slides out and because it's non-stick, you just wipe it with a damp paper towel and it's good-as-new!I like all the temperature options. Choices for frozen bread, pastry, degree of doneness, etc. The slots are wide enough for thick homemade bread or bagels and the extra lift feature is really nice.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I find that it's much slower to toast than my old crummy chrome toaster. I don't really see that as a problem - I just allow more time.This would be a great bridal shower gift!Please check out my other reviews of kitchen products and cookbooks."
4,Cool Looking Toaster!,"We received this toaster as a gift about a year and a half ago. So far, so good! We really like the cord storage and the crumb tray. Just recently we have had several problems with the toaster not popping up all the way. Other than that, it's been great."
2,Stay clear,It's a nightmare to assamble but that was ok I liked doing that the best about thoes things. However once done its too THICK to get a good pose out of it. too many parts connecting for the extra armor it keeps falling off. arms and legs movements are limited. the cannon is HUGE forget about putting it on and keeping the Gundam standing.Overall this model is much like the Zeta Gundam and the normal Zz Gundam all three shouldnt even be considred they suck.
1,Too cheap; Made in China feel,"Long story short, the box and instructions are cool but the final product false apart like a cheap, Chinese motorcycle. It looks cool, but the feel of it is weak. Do not be fooled, it will come apart.The picture here is only cool, because they paint it. If you don't paint it, it looks like plain and boring.Pieces break off easily. You can't play with it. It can't stand up without any special vices.This is not for beginners. It is not a toy. It is never going to be a toy.It is only for professional hobby nerds. Stay away if you are not a professional hobbyist."
2,Dense,"Bought for an education class. Definitely not worth reading. It's a dense book, lacks structure, and doesn't seem to give practical tips. Instead, I'd suggest 50 strategies for content area literacy. It's more practical (especially for me, a high school math teacher) and, not to mention, MUCH more inexpensive."
4,Good value,I have only used this a couple times (for large batches) but it seems to be an excellent pot. I was able to purchase it online for less than 1/2 what I would have paid in a local store.
3,I second fuzzy text argument,"I'd just like to second the fuzzy text argument. I bought this monitor with high expectations due to the nice reviews that it got across the internet however using this on any resolution higher than 1152x is just disgusting and not just visually displeasing, it hurts your eyes to look at it for very long."
2,DOTS FUZZY TYPE,I agree with the comments below. Type appears to be fuzzy and no settings will change that for me. (followed the advice below too and to no avail. It is however the best setting though) I am returning for something totally different. Any recommendations for a graphic designer who works in Photoshop and Quark? Type is a huge deal to me - needs to be CLEAR!
4,great for serious use,"I have dragged one of these all over the Pacific. In caves, shipwrecks, and through the jungles searching for missing US aircraft from previous wars. I have had it below 200 feet with no problems. It has taken lots of abuse with no breakdowns. The only weak point is the nylon screw and washer holding the coil in place. Carry spares."
5,A fun history of computer science and engineering,"From turning on a flash light to coding, this book covers all history in programming in a very interesting way. This is not a book tell you how computer works. It is a story about how we get there. This one is a must-read for people interested in computer science and computer engineering."
5,The best book I've read in years!,"This book starts out by explaining how batteries produce electricity, then goes into the telegraph and the light bulb, and then based on that moves into explaining how computer logic gates work, how computer memory works, how different parts of the computer communicate over the buss. I've learned at the lowest level, all the way down to the electrons, those fundamentals that I have been seeking to understand for 12 years.If you buy no other computer book this year, and you have the same yearning as I do to know the lowest of details without having to understand complex mathematics than you should buy this book. It is an absolute master piece of technical literature. It will teach you how electricity works and flows, how computers turn that electricity into bits and bites and running programs. It will help you to easily understand the lowest levels of computers."
5,Yet another acclaim,"The readers who've already written reviews have said it all: this book has style and sophistication in textual presentation, as well as visual excellence. From the perspective of a tech writer and one fascinated by the guts of computers-- hardware and software-- you would be doing anyone a favor if you give this book as a gift. If you work through Petzold's circuitry with a child or grandchild, you've given twice."
2,I don't recommend it,"I didn't enjoy this book. It's okay, I guess, if you've had pretty much zero introduction to coding, and know just a bit of math. Really though, the material presented in this book would be better learned in exercises or something, or from a website, for free, online."
4,pretty good,"The books starts off great, but later drowns in tedious details about the construction of complex circuits. I can't be too critical since it is apparently the purpose of the book to give such details, and I'm glad it didn't have the opposite problem of dumbing it down too much, but I think it could have been done better with the intended audience in mind."
3,Would have loved this back in the 1980s,"If I were a teen or tween getting into computer programming today I'd probably love this book now, but having been in the ""biz"" for a long time a lot of it was old hat. Still, the piece by piece ""construction"" of a CPU did make me think about some details I'd forgotten or never knew, and it was a very decent read. It is a little out of date toward the end, but for the right audience it's still a good grounding in some low-level computer bits (pun intended) you probably won't encounter elsewhere in as readable a form."
2,TRUST ME BE A GENIUS OR ENGINEERING WIZARD.,"Not for the layman, I can tell you that much. You will go dizzy by page 142 or so. Leave this behind and ask someone how computers work, maybe a scientist at your school or something along those lines."
5,Two Thumbs Up,"I had this book recommended to me by several people before purchasing it. I guess I didn't quite realize what they meant by ""programming from the ground up."" Petzold starts out by explaining different codes and then, this I really enjoyed, teaches you about how electric currents work and how they form logic gates.The book is also very readable. Unlike most technical books, you can just sit down and read it, so you definitely don't have to slog through it.Most of the explanations are very clear and, since the book starts from the very basic and builds up, it's very easy to understand. I think a 12 year old who's passionate about computers would probably feel comfortable with the book."
4,A Labor of Love,"Want to know how computers work -- like, really? Petzold's book explains it all, tracing the evolution of computer circuitry from the telegraph to the machines we know today, in intricate detail. Heavy on electrical engineering (which was great for me, with my relative ignorance of it), and a fun, if somewhat thick, read -- Mr. Wizard for computer nerds, you might say.I've heard the words ""labor of love"" used to describe this book. The description fits perfectly. Highly recommended."
4,Filled in the nuts and bolts I was missing,"My undergrad was Human Resource Management. As a programmer, I was missing some of the nuts and bolts of computer science. This book filled in some gaps. The most exciting part for me was chapter 24. The author takes you through machine code, assembly, and finally ALGOL."
5,takes the mystery out of the woking of a computer!,It is amazingly simple to read and understand how a computer truly works as a whole. There is no magic in the working of a computer now. Its only logical!
5,Great foundation for any developer.,"I found this book very well written. Easy to understand descriptions of fairly complex concepts. So many of us use computers today and we have no idea how we got here. If you'd like a concise walk through history and an undersntanding of what a computer is doing under the keyboard, this is a great read."
4,Information in easy to digest chunks,"It's not often that you come across a book that deals with complex topics in language that the layman can understand.The organisation is excellent - Petzold explores one topic at a time, giving you the chance to absorb one concept before moving on to the next. And each chapter builds on what you have read before.If you are just curious about what goes on inside your PC, or if you are involved in IT but lack an understanding of the actual box that does all the work, then this book is for you."
1,Boring,"I read all the glowing ""best book of the year"" reviews and bought itWell i am disappointed, it is not interesting to read at all.Repetition, annoying over simplification, The size of the book could have been reduced to 1/3 without effecting the content's substance."
1,It doesn't make a difference,"I bought this item hoping to see an improvement over a RCA regular video cable, but there was no difference at all."
3,Fluer De Lis - 'Facing Morning' (DMA),"Originally released in 1971, as this was the Dutch psychedelic band's sole effort. Tracks that made this disc okay to listen to are the eight-minute ""Home Of Mind"", the {also} eight-minute title cut ""Facing Morning"", ""Why"" and the somewhat familiar-sounding ""Sympathic Attitude"" - I'm sure I've heard this tune before. The vocals on this CD reissue aren't very good - but the playing is better. Line-up: Leif Nielson - guitar, clavinet & vocals, Bjame Pedersen - guitar, Peder Petersen - bass, Svend Thomsen - organ Kaj Olesen - drums. Might draw in fans of H. P. Lovecraft, early Hawkwind and Moby Grape."
2,adorama can't mail,"2 months later i receive my purchase, after i. contacted them many times. though, admittedly after i did get through they responded promptly."
1,Nothing Like the Others from the Emmanuelle Series,"Disappointing to say the least. Bad acting, sub-titles are not what the actors are saying, but then who cares... 'cause what the actors are saying isn't worth listening to. Save your money (and your time) and just purchase additional copies of the original and Emmanuelle 2 with Sylvia Kristel."
3,Meh,"A bit old school and the plot sucks, got's nakedness abound in it if thats all you want, blah blah blah"
2,Blind leading the blind,"I tend to be highly skeptical of a Shakespeare 'expert' who has a flawed grasp of the English language, for instance, his Capitalization of Nouns every Chance He Gets. Also, his frequent references to his living in Colorado, as if that helps his thesis. Go Broncos! He literally makes up a fantasy man who he fits into the Shakespeare suit like a mannikin. He seems to think he was Jewish, a foreigner, yet was so intimate with the Virgin Queen that they made a lifetime vow together. I think not. Shakespeare was Edward de Vere. This book is probably a crackpot's brew, beware."
4,Interesting but.....,This is a good cd set but I found when it comes to grammar it's easier to learn from printed material.
3,The famously broken bits are still broken.,"Pointing out Word's faults is like pointing out the pyramids are crumbling--it may be true, but they're still going to be there. Still, Word's Master Document ""feature"" is still the surest way to document corruption. And you'd better track down the internet page that gives detailed instructions on the convoluted way you need to set up heading numbering if you want to keep your Word documents from corrupting.And so on. I doubt anyone cares. Word is a fact of life, no matter if it's constantly falling to bits. The new version's XML support does give you a new path to recovering a corrupted document: saving to XML and then converting that file back to Word format has saved me some time on a couple of occasions.We use Word because we have to. On those occasions when I don't have to, I use WordPerfect, because I like to actually produce things, not spend my time dealing with software problems."
4,"Not an just ""old"" version of MS Word, 2003","This software installed fine but was inadvertently advertised just as an older version of MS Word, 2003, whereas, it was really an ""upgrade"" version of the software. Luckily I had a product key for Office 97 that allowed me to install this software."
2,Version 5 has quality problems,"Note that these monitors come in different versions. I am a happy user of P225FB-4 monitor that is made in Taiwan. Recently I needed another monitor and didn't think twice about buying P225FB, but I bought version -5 this time. It is different. Not only it has different layout of both front and back panels, which I have no objection to, but the image is also of considerably lower quality. Graphics is not bad, but text in high-res modes (1600x1200) is not readable. I also noticed that on version -5 it now says that it is made in China. After I tried two units of P225FB-5, I decided to try Cornerstone P1750. That monitor works flawlessly with both text and graphics. On top of that it can do over 100Hz refresh rates at 1600x1200 resolution, unlike ViewSonic.The bottom line is if you can get P225FB-4 -- it is excellent.Don't buy P225FB-5 -- poor quality assembly and plenty of engineering defects."
2,Viewsonic seems to currently have CRT problems,"I have had great success with Viewsonic in the past. However, last September I purchased a G810 that came DOA. Its replacement is currently having problems too. My Mitsubishi 91TXM finally died after 6 good years of service. I replaced it with a Viewsonic P225F-5 that came with 1/2 of the screen very blurry. I had the factory replace it and the 2nd one came with 2 very dark bands running vertical through the screen -- about 3-inches wide each. It is going back too. I'm going to try a Cornerstone P1750 next."
2,Great Monitor .....until u own it for a few months....,I bought this monitor from an online retailer about 3 months ago. First month went well and I loved the richness of color and the controls and features it offered.Second month started to notice every once in a while the monitor would flicker in certain parts of screen.Third and final month I wake up and turn on the monitor to see a bright red patch of color in one corner. The lower corner had a bright green patch of color. I turned it off.... and waited 30 mins. Nope still there. Checked my video card with a different monitor and it was fine. Then I tried the p220 again and now it got worst. I had a bright blue screen plus a red patch in one corner and a green patch in another.I will never buy viewsonic again useless they show that they have corrected there flaws in this monitor and higher grade monitors. As they seem to have quality issues..
3,Joints too loose,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. Great toy, but the arm joints are loose. Battle droid can't hold a gun in the 'ponting' positions, both arms just drop to his sides."
3,A Valuable Primer On The State Of Gay Rights Today,"Those who order this book may be surprised at its relatively small size (the book is actually 198 pages long, instead of the 320 cited above). ""21st Century Gay"" manages to walk straight down the middle of the gulf between gay seperatists and gay mainstreamers by pointing out how both sides in the end truly need each other (even though they often find themselves thwarting each other). Pivotal events, such as the Shepard tragedy and Rock Hudson's AIDS revelation, are described in overtly practical terms that lends insight into the social climate that made these episodes turning points in gay america--in ways I never fully considered.If you're looking for a book that endorses either mainstream or seperatist approaches in the continuing struggle for gay rights, you won't find it here. However, I believe the uncommonly balanced coverage in ""21st Century Gay"" makes it one of the most valuable primers of gay rights issues you'll ever find."
4,Oops!,"This was not exactly what I was expecting. I thought it would be more like what I call ""Vietnamese Sesame Balls."" Yet they were pretty good despite my mistake."
3,ok,"They are OK, but I wouldn't recommend them for the price. This mochi is very marshmallow-like compared to other types."
4,Good Candy,My daughter wanted to try Japansese candy because she had read about it. She said this product was chewy and sweet. It was definitely different. It reminded me of homemade citrus candy. If you like chewy sweets you will like it.
3,a wrong product,"I am writing to let you know that you send a wrong kind of product.I ordered Japanese Green Tea Mochi + Yomogi & Read Been Mochi, so they are 2 packs. As you posted picture, one kind should be different but what you sent is the same 2packs of Green tea mochi. It is different from the picture of these products you posted on amazon.com.Japanese Green Tea Mochi + Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler - 2x 8 PcI bought these for my friend's birthday gift whose birthday is this Friday.How will you do with this problem?"
2,"Look good, Smell like clay",I bought these in the hopes that they would taste as good as people have told me. I was utterly disappointed in these things. They smelled mostly like playdough and tasted the same.Others may find this appealing but I did not.
2,This item is not a 1-1/2 liter decanter,"This item is described as a 1-1/2 liter decanter, however, it is only a 1 liter decanter. The specs on Amazon refer to the Spiegelau Magnum decanter. When I checked the Spiegelau website, this particular item (#7060159) is the ""medium decanter"". The Amazon description refers to the specs for the ""Large Decanter"" (#7060157). Beware if you're looking for a mag decanter."
5,elegant and sturdy,"I must admit that I always thought that people who decanted their wines were just a little bit over the top. A friend of mine told me that he could take a relatively cheap - or new - wine and make it taste better by pouring the wine into a decanter through a wine strainer. By increasing the wine's exposure to oxygen it reduced the tannic taste some wines have when poured immediately from the bottle; proving the old ""let it breathe"" adage. He won me over after we hammered down a couple of bottle of wine his way. I purchased this along with the 1 liter version as a gift for another friend."
1,Buy it - if you enjoy drinking grounds with your coffee!,"This maker brews coffee fairly quickly and the delayed brew/timer is a nice feature. Unfortunately, about every other time that you make coffee, the basket will overflow. It doesn't seem to matter how carefully you place the basket or the pot in the brewer. Grounds end up in your coffee and all over the counter. If you like cleaning up that sort of thing, get it. If not, spend the extra cash and get a Bunn."
1,Very Disappointing,"Same problem as everyone else, no matter how carefully you place that carafe, it will overflow. And it is very annoying to wake up to a huge mess in all over the kitchen counter in the morning. I hate the thing and am looking for a decent replacement. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by Mr. Coffee."
4,Convenient Features,I just tossed my Cuisenart grind-n-brew that I have enjoyed for 6 years and purchased this Mr. Coffee. I appreciate the removeable water resevoir (no more spilling water all over the counter) and the no drip spout on the pot as well as the removeable filter holder that doesn't require that I get coffee grounds all over my fingers to remove the used filter from the pot. It does not grind my beans but neither do I have to clean the grinder parts. All in all its features and the quality of the coffee make the price very reasonable. I look forward to using this coffee maker for another 5 - 6 years.
3,See Bowie on the way up,"I enjoyed the honest, revealing, funny anecdotes from Angela Bowie who, as the surviving members of Spiders from Mars attest to, was like a 5th member of the band:(hear how Angela helped concieve the show and bands' wardrobe). She even convinced RCA to finance the Pennebaker film.Guitarist Mick Ronson and the other Spiders finally get well deserved credit for being crucial to the Bowie sound on his early recordings.The DVD contains musically insightful comments from critics on certain songs (E.g. ""5 Years"", ""Suffragette City"") but I would have liked more insights into ALL individual songs on the ""Ziggy Stardust"" LP. The DVD is approx. 48 minutes long and, for the price, more musical comments would have convinced me to give this DVD a higher rating.However this seems to be an honest look at the making of Ziggy Stardust and it's probably not the one David would like us to see."
4,Good insight into Knights of Solamnia,Weasels luck (The first part of the story) wasn't as good as this book but you should read it before you read this book.However this book stands on it's own two feet(a book standing on two feet? What a concept). A MUST read for any one who's into Dragonlance at all.
1,Dumb,This book absoulutely sucks. No one should buy it because it is stupid. I ended up never readingWeasel's Luck because it had the same main characters and it was written by the same author.
3,Who let Michael Williams write poetry?,"Regarding the book: Actually, it's not bad. Decent light reading, and one of the few DL books that are readable, in addition to the Chronicles, the Legends, and anything written by Richard Knaak.Now, the poetry. Who thought it would be a good idea to include Michael William's poetry in ANY of the DL books? It is shudderinly bad. And then he tries to pretend that it could possibly be used as songs? Maybe it is very good technically, I wouldn't know, but his words and thoughts that he express are cringe-inducing. All this airy, unreadable, incomprehensible junk about wild, impartial skies, and sharks, and darkness...he is terrible - but obviously he thinks that it is wonderful stuff, on par with all of the famous writers. What a poseur.Anyway, read the book. Skip the poetry."
2,"review of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Spiral, 5.5-Ounce Boxes","This type of Mac & Cheese pasta doesn't produce as much as the elbow mac & cheese. Other than that, it tastes the same. Good stuff!"
2,Spirals depress me....,"Yeah so... I really do not like this one bit.The 'cheese' is horrid, dose not taste like real cheese.The noodles are ok... a little soggy but ok.And it leaves a nice layer of starch in your mouth. As Rachal Ray wouldsay 'yumO!'Anyway, I hate it. And spirals depress me."
3,'album of fluid motion' delivery,"all right. Except the delivery company in Italy/Rome charged another 3 for transport,on top of the transport charge nominated by Amazon. Thanks anyway."
5,Easy to set up with XP,"This printer gives excellent output, very small footprint and very easy to set up with my new Sony Vaio Computer running Window XP."
2,"Prints well, missing functionality","The print quality and speed are great for the price.However, there are no buttons on the printer. If you run out of paper while it is printing, the light just blinks. The only way to coninue after adding paper is to print something else. ...or turn it off, then on again.I'd give it a 5 in print quality and speed and a 0 for the lack of controls."
2,A great printer (when it works!),"The HP1000 is an extremely cost effective laser printer (mine cost $99.95). Quality an speed are good enough for an individual user. However, the printer has USB interface problems that HP has not been able to resolve. In my case, it is necessary to unplug, then reconnect the USB cable every time the Windows 2000 is rebooted. Once the printer is online, it performs with the usual HP quality."
2,"Cheesy, Lame, Printer","I have had this printer for one year and now it is dead. I changed cables while the printer was powered on in order to hook it up to my daughters computer temporarily. Power went out. Found a small print warning message to never remove printer cable while printer is on! There is also no on off switch. That means they were too cheap to put any transient suppression, emi, or soft start circuitry in the computer.Before I blew the darn thing up, it didn't print very well. Many print jobs printed over and over. HP techs told me that that was a common problem and their lame solution was to cancel the print job manually.Save up more money and buy a decent printer from someone besides HP!"
2,"Cheap, in every sense","I have an HP LaserJet 5L that I like. When I needed a printer for a second office, I bought this one largely because of the HP name. I regret my purchase. It was inexpensive, but it's incompatible with Linux and lacks standard Centronics connectivity. It misfeeds all the time and toner cartridges cost a fortune. This is an example of a company capitalizing on its name -- but my purchase of this unit represents the last time I buy an HP product without thinking twice."
2,Buyer Beware: Read Technical Details Before Ordering,"Requires Windows 98 or greater. Not obvious from the main entry at ...It arrived & looks really cute. I'm trying to get my software upgrade but, meanwhile, printer is useless.HP has acknowledged that it absolutely won't run on Windows 95."
5,Get the job done fast and easy....,"I owned another HP printer before this one, a DeskJet. For its time it was top-of-the-line. But it was a complete piece of junk. It was loud and shook alot and made big cracking noises. I was glad to be ridding myself of that old, over-priced thing, but wasn't too fast to buy another HP. In fact, as I shopped around, I avoided HP's, as I assumed I'd find something better from another company. I was wrong.I set out to find a printer that just printed things. I didn't need to print posters--or billboards for that matter--I just wanted to print essays and what not, fast, quietly and inexpensively. The HP LaserJet1000 fulfilled all of these requirements for a fantastic price. No, it doesn't print in color. But I never used color anyway! If you need a very good printer to do all your standard, basic printing, here's the printer for you!"
5,Amazing Printer Value,"The HP LaserJet 1000 is simply the best buy in printers available today. I purchased one to replace my existing inkjet printer, which ate ink at an incredible rate, and since October, I have had no problems whatsoever.The resolution is rock-solid, the print quality is high, it prints at a very fast rate, and most importantly, it has gone well over 1300 pages on a single cartridge, making it a huge cost savings! (compared to an inkjet)Bottom line? You can't beat this printer. HP reliability, fast printing, high quality. Best bang for the buck."
1,I have this printer. It is in the trash.,"This printer died on me after less than a year. It is so cheesy that it does n't even have an off switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off. This is the second laser I had from HP, and they both died young. Sometimes it would stop feeding with the paper stuck in the middle of the machine, and there was no way to get it to feed the paper the rest of the way through. HP drivers always gave me some trouble also.Don't buy it!!!"
5,ViewSonic G90FB-2,"I've had this monitor for about a year now and so far it has been operating reliably. At first, you'll have to do some tweaking to get it set up just the way you like it. I set the resolution to 1024X768 and the refresh rate to 100 Hz, which to my eyes makes it totally flicker-free with sharp graphics and fonts just big enough to make text reading easy.This monitor has very good brightness and contrast. The colors are solid and vivid. It measures approximately 18"" deep and the front glass is flat and exactly 18"" diagonal. The screen behind the front glass may be curved (like others have noted), but they use some kind of optical trickery to make the net image seem flat. For the most part, it works, but it's NOT perfect. If you want/need a true flat monitor, perhaps an LCD is best for you. However, if price is a consideration, then you may want to try this value packed item. I have no regrets."
4,CRT ver LCD,"This monitor was not as bright as the Sony I had before but Sony no longer makes a CRT monitor. I have an LCD monitor and when you compare the LCD monitor with this monitor the LCD is junk. This monitor has a good picture. The thing I didn't like about Viewsonic monitors is that is shows up in the Device Hardware and in the video properties as a plug and play monitor, instead of telling you the name of the monitor and the model number."
2,"Good Looks, Poor Performance, Poor Support","Purchased ViewSonic G90fb 19"" CRT based on other reviews. Much to my surprise the unit I received does not perform as expected. Monitor brightness varies depending on the windows that are open on the screen - when there is a large white window open (i.e. My Computer) the screen darkens and shrinks about 1 mm on all sides. When the white window is resized or minimized, the whole screen visibly lightens and expands. I can accept the fact that maybe this unit is defective, but the ViewSonic customer support is virtually non-existent: after trying for one week I have no response to 5 separate emails, the telephone support is inevitably 'busy assisting other customers' and 'experiencing high volume'. Based on my personal experience, I would strongly advise anybody against doing business with ViewSonic."
1,"""Software not compatible with Windows"" - yikes!","Just bought this, lugged it upstairs, onto the desk, etc., and when I put in the disk to load the software, I got a message saying ""Contact hardware vendor for software that has passed Windows logo testing. Do not proceed any further or it will damage your system, etc"" -- !? I am trying to get to the bottom of it, but so far, this hasn't been smooth sailing!"
2,You better be VERY Right-Brained,"Sorry, but I could not follow this book. Not only was it not going where I wanted to go it kept dropping me off and leaving me nowhere. In almost every chapter I'd just start to get into the project and turn the page and it was like the pages got jumbled up at the printers, a new chapter would start and we're doing a new unrelated project. I never knew where I was going or why. I can only imagine that if you are very Right brained you might be able to work with this book. I'm very Left-Brained. I got to about page 90 and gave up trying to make any sense of it. I did get a couple pointers that were nice to have, but I don't know if they were worth the $ I spent for it. I'm going to let my business partner read it and see if it works any better for him."
2,Really a Disappointment,"This is one of those books that should really be what is considered a ""Gem."" Unfortunately it is not. For reasons that I am not quite clear on, the book has very little practical information beyond a rank beginner's skill level. If you know absolutely nothing of winter camping/hiking/backpacking, this little book can be for some value. For example, the author rightly touts the advantages of fleece and names brands, and while I believe it to be consistent with my own experiences, there is very little added in depth info. For as competent and experienced as the author appears to be, only 1% of his knowledge and skill seems to be put to paper. I got the impression after reading this book that a hands-on experience in the field with the author would give the reader and novice exactly what one hopes to glean from the book."
1,Viewsonic P225 Professional monitor disappoints,"While I was impressed with the speed (and price) in which this heavy monitor was delivered from Amazon.com, I am disappointed in its performance.The monitor had an evident color cast across the screen. No adjusments could compensate for the color cast. Tried relocation of the monitor, using another computer, the defect was consistent in any environment.Viewsonic replaced the monitor ( I was without for over a week as the transfer took place!) and the replacement monitor, while better, displays the same problem. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a monitor suitable for production photo work."
4,Hard Rockin' Blues from a Master!,"Jake is best known for his work with ozzy. Though different away from the ""ozzomania"" he is a great axe slinger. If you like hard rock played to perfection without losing it's edge Jake is your guitar player. This is a cool colection of songs hand picked and changed only in ways that make them shine brighter than the originals. A must for fans of rock and roll at it's best.P.S. - Jake, Don't put that six sting thing back in the closet. Us old time metal heads need musicains like you!"
1,Gotta agree with Allister,"In response to E Voorhies response to Allister Fiend's review of Retraced, I have to agree with A Fiend. I was so eager to hear Jake's new CD (despite the fact that it's just a batch of cover songs), and I was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. The production is terrible and the vocalist is HORRIFIC. Who is this guy? On the bright side, I the guitar tone is OK.It's funny that people get so upset with negative reviews on Amazon. I suppose most (if not all) of the people who are interested in the album are Jake fans that only want to read good reviews, but not every CD is a winner. I like Jake, alway have, but Allister was right on this one."
3,Not Jake E Lee's fault,"I must agree with certain reviewers who consider the production terrible. I also consider the guitar sound dry, when it should have been more warmer.Pity, as the effort by Mr. lee and company are first rate.I know Mike Varney has recorded similar blues rock artists like Pat Travers. I just hope the production and guitar sound is not like this"
3,The Vocals are Terrible.,"I'm a big Jake E. Lee fan from way back. His Badlands work is some of the greatest guitar ever. He doesn't disappoint here either, but the singer does. Chris Logan sounds awful. I have other stuff with Chris on it and he has never sounded this bad. It is almost as if he had vocal chord surgery, because he has almost no range and takes the easy way out when challenged by a higher or longer vocal in the original song. What a shame because it overshadows Jake's playing, making it almost unlistenable at times.There are a few decent songs like ""Rock Candy"" and Love is Worth the Blues"", and Jake makes it enough for three stars, but if you are looking for a classic this isn't it."
5,Flat out rocks!!!!,"Jake E. Lee's band is very tight and produces an explosion of incredible sound! With hints of ""Badlands"" scattered throughout the cd. Awesome job guys! Jake did a great job of making the songs sound like original material, not cover songs."
4,Good study book for spoken Chinese,"This is a good grammar text book for spoken Mandarin Chinese. It gives lots of examples, drills and grammar explanations in its twenty lessons. It uses an outmoded phonetic spelling system developed during WWII by Yale University which is similar to the the widespread Pin Yin phonetic spelling. This Yale romanization is actually designed for the English tongue, so it seems more natural to pronounce than Pin Yin, but since not many places teach it, it's of limited use."
5,Solid well made,"It is heavy and has a nice smooth glide when swiveling. Note if you buy the tripod from PLS it has one in the box already, but if you need one for another reason this will do just fine for you."
4,Pacfic Laser Systems Female to Male,"Price was a bit high, but wanted a quality mount for my laser level. This works well in putting my laser onto the tripod. Set up is a breeze, and it's well constructed."
5,preferred adaptor for PLS laser tripods and lasers,"This adaptor is all metal, somewhat shock dampening, and rotates 360degrees. This makes it much more convenient to use than the plastic adaptor that is included with the PLS 9'6"" Elevator Tripod. It isn't required, but for $19 it will make your life a lot easier when you need to change your vertical alignment lines"
5,Easy,"Good adapter.. just thread it onto the tripod until it bottoms, and then thread your laser on the top of it and away you go.Just double check what sizes you need. I have the PLS 180 laser and this worked out perfect for me."
4,"Excellent historical book re river, but impractical as a guide.","I enjoyed this book immensely. The history of the Middle Fork was well presented in a manor that kept me well engauged. However, if you are looking for a practical guide to paddling or rowing the river (and to locate the hot-springs) I'd Recommend ""The Middle Fork of the Salmon River : A Comprehensive Guide""; a waterproof spiral bound book primarily aimed at rafters, but indispensable to kayakers & canoeists as well."
1,Not what I expected,"If you are thinking that this book might be comparable to Becky's guides...forget it. Not a lot of depth here. There is more discussion of local plants than on route descriptions, approaches or maps. I was looking for a GUIDE BOOK to the middle fork area and this is definitely not it. If someone writes one that actually provides enough information to plan an outing then would gladly buy it. Save your money and buy some topos and get better trip beta, pictures and maps on the internet."
5,Outstanding and Unforgettable,"This book is a particularly outstanding memoir of the Vietnam War. It portrays the experiences of a combat infantryman accurately. I was one. Through a series of true stories the author takes us along on patrols, into ambushes, and into the Valley of the Shadow of Death numerous times. He also opens his heart to us in scenes that are unforgettable. Try and forget the scene of the author calming a trembling naked Viet Cong prisoner who only hours before had tried to kill him. You won't be able to forget."
4,Important Documentary,"These soldiers live a life of 98% utter boredom and 2% terror. It will give you a renewed respect for the combat veterans closest to enemy lines. Almost all of them have to watch a close friend or two bleed out and die on a helicopter, a gurney, or even laying in the dirt. Eliminating the Taliban will only happen at great cost of lives and resources (if it's possible at all.)"
5,Brotherhood,"Haunting. If you asked me to describe this film in one word it is haunting. This documentary paints a powerful picture of the brother hood of men under fire, and highlighted for me just how easily a young boy can be tainted by the horrors of war. I found this particularly interesting because my grandfather fought with this unit, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, in WWII in the Pacific. Both my grandfather and father who fought in Vietnam came home with PTSD. There is a glimpse here of what kind of fear these great men in my life had felt to cause that. This documentary is incredibly well done and I suggest you pay hommage to Doc Restrepo by spending a little time and watching what our soldiers are willing to endure for us."
5,Great Movie,"Very glad I bought this one and really took to watching it. I liked it every bit as much as Hurt Locker, but in a different way because this is real combat footage. This is a Best in Class DVD. The only thing is I don't know that it was worth the extra $$$ for me to buy the Blu-Ray version. (I don't know if anyone could tell the difference between Blu-Ray and the regular DVD). Really glad to have watched it and really proud of the men and the Captain in Combat Company."
3,"Good story, poor video quality","First off, the story is pretty good. Shows soldiers in a wide range of emotions and puts a face to those fighting the war. I would recommend watching this documentary.However the bluray is bad 1080i quality. When you mix fast movements/action, and hand camcorders with interlaced video it looks choppy. Obviously bluray is not designed to play on anything other than LCD, Plasma, DLP, pretty much everything that doesn't use a tube. Interlaced video is deisgned for tube TV's do why 1080i is even around, I dont know. The producers of the bluray should have deinterlaced it to 1080p. There is a large amount of noise in the video, especially in low light scenes which is expected since you don't want to be using an additional light where this is being shot at. If I was the videographer I would be also been cleaning that lens constantly considering in that environment. The dirty lens is a distraction to me. This is noticable even in the planned shots that aren't during action."
5,Awesome,This was an incredible documentary. It showed great insight on the terror our American troops faced everyday in the Korengal Valley.
2,all the potential of a great documentary,"There is a great story here, instead the ham handed editing actually interferes with you bonding with the characters. You personally have to battle through the editing to rebuild the actual story line that they perverted to create this abomination, to realize the power of the impact of the individual that the film was ostensibly created to honor. I feel sorry for the cohorts of Restrepo, who wanted their efforts to honor their friend and compatriot, instead this film is a monument to every anti-war cliche in film since 1969. I will credit the producers with this much, when they had no possibility of displaying the soldiers as rapists, they resorted to depicting them as homosexual, congratulations..."
4,dirt under your nails.,As real as it gets. Especially effective with the recnt combat death of one of the producer/photographers. Puts the viewer where these guys spent months. Most of us couldn't do it. Get these guys home.
3,Junger nails another one.,"As a long time fan of Sabastian Junger,, I knew I would have to read his book ""WAR"" based on this movie. The nature of war is not enjoyable for many to read about or watch. I especially liked the way Junger made each of the troops human. He explains how they lived in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan for ONE solid year. What they missed, how they adapted, how they cared for each other and how they tried to show their respect for a fallen brother. A very touching story. Somewhat graphic, but I can see that the conditions that these soldiers lived under were not pleasant. My total admiration to the U S Troops of the Korengal Valley."
5,Restrepo,"After reading ""War"", which I really loved, it was amazing to see ""Restrepo"" for myself. To see the soldiers and what they do is overwhelming. A movie about OEF that actually won't piss off soldiers who have been there, I think. And for civilians, it's a good break down and easy to understand."
2,Weak,"I worry that this film sends the wrong message. It may have had good intentions, but somewhere in the editing, it takes away too much of what these guys went through and turns what's left into a stereo-typical tool for the anti-war crowd. So much more happened that the filmmakers barely touched upon. I was looking forward to it, a tribute to a bunch of guys that fought hard and went through hell. Sadly, I was disappointed."
2,"Highest regard for the Soldiers, but the movie didn't move me","I have nothing but love & respect for our troops serving around the World and wanted to like this film very much--but I just didn't find anything in it that grabbed me. The troops are heroic; their task of defending a dangerous outpost compelling; and their having to deal with the local culture very ""catch-22"". But as a movie/documentary I found the film hard to warm up too. The character development of the real troops doesn't go very far for some reason so its hard to get to know any of the men beyond the Captain in charge. Add to that never actually seeing the enemy the troops are fighting and it adds up to a film I'm glad I watched and wouldn't be interested in seeing again."
2,Restrepo,"""One platoon. One valley. One year"" (imdb.com). American soldiers are sitting around talking, reading magazines, playing the guitar, and showing pictures of their families. This scene in the war documentary, Restrepo, directed by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger, shows the raw emotion of soldiers in the middle of a war and the relationships among men that have been strengthened through tragedy. Restrepo has been praised by many, and it was The Group Jury Prize Documentary 2010 at Sundance Film Festival. It was also nominated for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards. This recognition is not just because of the interesting cinematography or the intense battle sequences, but because of the emotional scenes the directors were able to capture and the ways in which they put those scenes together to make the viewers able to connect on a deeper level."
1,Poor sales description,"The video is a great piece of work. So is Amazon. They did not make it clear that the video could not be downloaded to a MAC until AFTER I purchased it. This is something that should be clearly, largely and prominently displayed so one could make an informed buy. This is the 21 century, get with the program. At least let us know up front.I hate to rate the video poorly but I wanted to raise the awareness of those that would be trapped like I was."
3,Not for everyone.,"The Nat. Geo. Documentery is ok to kill time. It is somewhat difficult to understand and follow unless you keep your concentration on it. Understand, this shows what the men are doing and feeling in combat. It's not a hollywood movie.The camera is focus in the face and the men expressing their feeling and emotions too much. If this is the purpose of the DVD then it is a hit. I find the film to be somewhat boreing moving from point-to-point, watching the fun time and listening to their rhetorical for an hour. I do have sentiment for the men and what they are feeling when a buddy is suddenly killed."
5,A strong effort,"A documentary chronicling the 15 month deployment of a combat unit in Afghanistan. The group establishes a forward position in the dangerous Korengal Valley, losing friends along the way. After viewing, you will understand why we no longer have forces based in the Korengal. A film that will bring the viewer into the Afghan conflict, understanding the difficulties our fighting men face on a daily basis."
3,gritty documentary,"Some parts I couldn't hear, of course I didn't expect a sound boom with the guys being so close to the enemy so it wasn't that big of a deal. Showed the gritty reality of war at an outpost right on top of the enemy. Nice documentary and peace be to the soldiers that lost their lives in this film and outside the documentary."
5,"Repeat: Not the author of ""It's Here Now""","The author of ""It's Here Now"" was born in the 40's. The book ""The Essential Unity of All Religions"" was first published in the 30's. They are two different authors with the same name. Although their names show a unity of sorts between them, the differences between their writing calibers could be used as an example of the spectrum of variance in the manifest ream. I'm just kidding bout the last sentence... but really, they're two different authors. One's dead, one's alive."
2,So-So,"When I ordered a tube of this grease, I thought it was like the honey colored grease Hoppe's used to make. It's not. It looks like everyday white lithium grease that you can buy at any auto parts store."
1,protecting idle firearms,"This is to protect idle firearms only, cant shoot with this stuff on you'll have to completely remove it, absolutely useless."
4,A Classic Tripod,"I owned one of these in the early 1970s and they continue in production unchanged today. I don't know the details, but there may have been ownership changes, but I think the tripod has remained the same.This was a solid, functional tripod, with only two small flaws. The center post slid in a paper sleeve that pulled loose on mine. Also, the material on the head was not the highest quality. Still, one could easily modify these.Overall, I like it well enough to consider buying one for my girlfriend for her birthday. BTW, the tripods I use are a CF Gitzo with Acratech head and a Manfrotto with Foba Superball, so I'm fairly fussy about tripods."
4,Good stuff,Very good tool for people serious in learning Finnish. But be serious- don't half try- try all the way cause that is the only way you'll learn it!
2,Too little,"I bought this book and I thought it would e a bit better. there's pronunciation, but i really got frustrated"
3,good book but,"I only give it three stars because I think it should focus more on application of how to end panic attacks and anxiety and less stories.Still, I would recommend reading it cause it's the best book on the subject I have read so far. It has practical advise as well, just too many stories and theory"
1,His Own Opinion,"I haven't read the whole book yet, but as I'm progressively reading it I do not agree with what he is insinuating. In one part of the book he is basically saying that niceness is connected to anxiousness. Just because a person is nice doesn't mean that they will have more anxiety. God is a nice God, but he is perfect and has no anxiety. So, I disagree with this and many other things Dr. Burns is saying. I appreciate his help in the book but it isn't affective to me. He says that if you surround yourself with you fear without a way of escaping it you would conquer your fear. That is not true. Some people faint or pass out when they have no way out. He says things you want to hear but things that may not be true for most people. I was expecting to read this book and my anxiety would melt away. That is far from true. To me, this book is a joke."
2,Kindle version - too many unreadable charts,"I would not recommend the Kindle version because the charts and worksheets are unreadable and unprintable. Maybe these can be found online somewhere, but should not have to search.Would like the printed copy instead, as the material is excellent!"
5,this book has been eye opening and incredibly helpful,"I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety recently! I wasn't able to start therapy right away because I was traveling, so I did some searching and got this book to sort of ""tide me over."" It has turned out to be VERY helpful! I almost decided it was enough to stop me needing therapy at all, but now I think the combination of this book and the work I am doing in therapy is a total silver bullet and the two are very complimentary.If you're really focused on trying to change your experience, and especially if you're looking for an active tool or technique for handling your anxious feelings, I would definitely recommend this book. I hardly ever leave reviews on things, but the reviews on this book helped convince me to get it and I am super glad I did. I also got the other more well known book by the same author, Feeling Good, and that has also been incredible. Recommended, good stuff."
3,The Title is quite misleading,"I have read the book almost entirely and have been pretty disappointed. the title ""when Panic attacks"" is quite misleading because the book almost doesn't discuss ""Panic Attacks"". The book is very good for people seeking help for many anxiety disorders for moderate conditions. the techniques expressed in the book are all great ones but written very short."
4,Excellent Beginning for Recovery,"This is a good book to aid in recovery, however, I agree with the author:quicker recovery from severe anxiety disorder is possible when assisted by a professional psychologist. But he does present some very valid points and I can attest to this from personal experience. One is that medication is not the answer. He stated that recovery time with and without medication is about the same. I agree. The book presents actual case studies and maps out a course for self-assisted recovery. And while these are very good tools, it was hard for me to focus on reading after a major breakdown. I think it does make a good companion to professionally guided psychotherapy, but is not a substitute."
3,"When Panic Attacks: The New, Drug-Free Anxiety Therapy That Can Change...",A VERY INTERESTING READ BUT NEEDS CONCENTRATING ON: WORK THROUGH IT UNDERLINING ALL THAT MAY BE RELEVANT:MPG 5 1 13
4,Resource for patient financial representatives,"This text is an excellent resource for administrative staff with limited clinical background. It is invaluable in composing letters of medical necessity and in conversing with insurance providers. Some changes could be made to the layout of the chapters for ease in finding specific orthoses, but overall the book is a great help."
1,Nice Image but doesn't last,"I have had 3 of these monitors now and they all seem to die after about 1.5 years. For the first 2 monitors, I was able to get a warranty replacement, but you either have to pay $70 for shipping or try to find a service center. When I shared my experiences with others in the industry, they have said that they have had the same experience w/the monitors dying. It is really bothersome because the intial clarity, color and resolution is so nice on the G810. I just can't afford to replace them every year or so."
1,wrong Monitor,I ordered this monitor and got a different one the ordered. it was an intergraph 21sd95. DOn't know what happened.
2,"Nice idea, but bad camera","This DVD is a nice idea- basically, they just planted a camera on a beach and you can sit and watch as if you were there- you watch the birds go by etc. But since they aren't really providing any content, you'd think they'd use the best camera they could find, but they didn't. The quality of the images is really bad- very 2-dimensional. It's very low resolution. Almost like a video that's been put onto a DVD. And the colors are flat and wrong-looking. The sound is fine- of the waves. Too bad the images aren't better."
5,Kitchen staple,"I'll never have to find another muffin recipe. I like baking muffins at least once a week. The few I have made from this book were very good. I like that some muffins have more than one recipe because people have different tastes, one is bound to satisfy."
1,Poor Editing,"Although there are a lot of recipes in this book, they all taste very similar and none are really great. Also, the editor did a terrible job in that there are ambiguities between the ingredients list and the instructions. I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who appreciates a truly great muffin."
3,"Not As Awful As Some Say, Not as Great as You Might Hope","There are certainly a lot of recipes here, but there is also a fair amount of repitition. It's an attractive book, and in that regard a beginning home baker might find it inspiring, if only as a means to see the many possibilities beyond the old ""plain or blueberry"" conumdrum. We tried a few, and found none of the choices particularly marvelous (but hey, maybe it was the baker, not the recipe....nah!). It's a good place to start, that's the best I can say for it. Perhaps the author would have been better served trying not to come up with 1,001 recipes. That's a lot of muffins, and a lot of potential selections. It's almost overwhelming. There may be some really wonderful recipes in here, but I may never discover them in a life that allows time for home baking once in a good week."
3,"Some good, some bad","An attractive & well-organized book. I found good recipes here, but also a few duds, probably the result of type errors. For instance, the Plain Muffins on pg. 219 call for 3 cups flour, which results in a stiff dough. I think this was meant to be 2 cups, like the other recipes in the book. The Bisquick Cobbler on pg 274 is much too wet, and though it was tasty enough, it needs more than one cup of Bisquick to change it from a pudding into a cobbler.What I did like: Oatmeal Muffins on pg. 209; Yankee Maple Muffins on pg. 252; Banana Tea Muffins on pg. 53.The photos spur one to bake, though I don't think I'll ever make the Sauerkraut-and-Pickle muffins."
2,"""the final gift"" - omg!","I was just starting to think this was going to be a pretty decent mystery when I encountered the following. I'm a far cry from a prude (really, ask anyone), but this had me going OMG! OMG! - and laughing in disbelief. Wasn't expecting a bodice-ripper, but... well, see for yourself...""She slid her body onto mine, moisture finding moisture, need finding need, plunging me deep within her. I grasped her slim waist, raising her, lowering her, hearing her sharp intake of breath each time I probed closer to home, each time I led her to the brink then drew her back, offering and withholding the final gift.""First person here is supposed to be a macho sorta guy. Right. The final gift. ROFL!"
3,Not one of my favorites of Jance.,"I am tearing through the J.P Beaumont series quickly and with incredible interest. J.A Jance is a great author and I cant help but be a little bias based on being a washintonian.I was dissapointed that once again J.P couldnt resist sleeping with one of the victims of the crime. I found myself speed reading through the ""couldnt resist temptation"" scenes. J.P getting topsy over McNaughton's while trying to solve the puzzle and getting no where fast but to a hangover was becoming a bit redundant as well, but the rest of the story seemed to make up for it. In J.P's personal life he is a mess, and in his professional life, equally a mess. Amazingly, the combination makes for a great read."
4,Good JA Jance,Love her Beaubont series. Have read them all. this was a second time around actually It still held my attention
2,Injustice for me too......,"Don't understand the hype with this. Although I did finish it, the writing was disjointed, the story meanders, and the characters not all that likable or believable. The ending proved ""hurry up"" with a quick attempt to wrap things up and bring together all the insignficant characters one met throughout the book and wondered shy they were even in the story."
4,Pleased.,I enjoyed the book very much and it wa easy to purchase the book. It was one I had missed in the series of JP Baumont
2,It's wrong.,"In my opinion, a man should not write a novel featuring a female protagonist in the first person narrative; neither should a woman write one as a man. In either situation, the author just doesn't get it - it's worng and it just doesn't work.I found most of the narrative insulting, the characters' motivations laughable, and the dialogue post-adolesent juvenile.In the Johanna Brady series, Ms. Jance shows her talents. In the J.P. Beaumont series, she falls flat.Would not recommend this, or any other book in this series."
4,a fine watch for swimming,"I bought this watch to use while swimming in order to time laps, and it has worked well at that task. I find it comfortable while swimming, but it starts bothering me if I wear it all day long. I definitely recommend it as a watch to use while exercising."
2,'Sports' Watch but Velcro Doesn' Hold,"Simply the watch doesn't perform like a sports watch should. I got it for my girlfriend to wear during a sprint triathlon, but the velcro came undone at the beginning of the swim. The band can't be replaced because of the way the watch is made. For the price the watch keeps lap time, and has the other extras, but I wouldn't recomend it as a sports watch."
4,Timex Ironman,It is a great product that delivers a lot of features for the price. I use it daily it is comfortable to wear and not too bulky. I wish I can find a watch like this with an HRM includes.
4,"Deep, but overly dense","This book provides excellent coverage of logic and computability (I haven't really looked at the ""Discrete Structures"" component yet), but is often unnecessarily verbose in its explanations. It would work well in conjunction with a well-taught class, but not necessarily as good on its own."
2,Don't Bother,"All of the songs are solid, but they're all on the album. Yeah, they are live versions, but what's the big difference. They aren't even as good as the studio recording. If you're going to put out a single, it should usually have some new songs on it. Uggg....what a waste of money. The ECD isn't something worth paying for either. Do yourself a favor and just stick with the album. If you want some cool b-sides, then go for the ""My Hero"" single."
3,good old standby,"I grew up with one of these mixers & my Mom still uses it. I got a new one about 5 years ago--one of those dreams you have as a kid to be well enough off to own a stand mixer... It was fine for a while, but after countless double-batches of chocolate chip cookies I burned out the motor. It is not repairable, so now my only question is which Kitchenaid Stand Mixer to replace it with?"
4,Wonderful story,I found this story to be very moving and spiritual. I enjoyed it so much that I sent the author an email to thank her for writing it.
5,Keeping it real,"I found the author's style to be very readable and memorable. Written as journal entries with viewpoints from each friend, the author provided different windows into the same story. It was refreshing. I believed that every moment of this story of two unlikely friends could actually happen. My next step is to pick up on the rest of the story with the sequels to this first book in the series."
3,s'alright,"starts off great, don't slander me, bermuda, haunt and burn the flames are my favouritessome of it's very bland, crazy crazy mama is so bad it's likablenow i bought it out of curiosity, i really only like half of it but if you are into this kind of thing you'd probably dig it"
4,"Not your everyday read, but I enjoyed it immensely","Long. Very enjoyable though, even if sometimes dry. Gibbon has a wit about him. And if you are interested in linguistics and history, the way in which he uses words is an interesting foray into the changes in the English language since the book's writing."
1,Author is Anti-Catholic,"In case no one knows or wonders why they might have a sour taste from this book, its because of Gibbon's espousing very Anti-Christian twisted sentiments in this book.Don't believe me? Go to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Pages 564-65 clearly demonstrate his hatred for Christianity.This book is garbage...please discard and do not give to anyone you care about."
2,Form over substance,"The design of the book is lovely. The photographs are enticing. The table of contents suggests a valuable and interesting book. But focus of the text, the information content, is excessively historical. If you want to know the spiritual significance attached to certain plants by various spiritual groups, you might like this. If you wish to create a sacred space and seek design help, there are better choices."
2,Did anyone even look at the galley proofs?!?,"It must be said that this is a beautiful book! Photographs, paper, color, layout -- and the text could/would have been, too. But starting on pages 46/47, the text is totally dismembered -- big chunks missing [go from one page to the next mid-sentence and find an entirely different sentence being continued], and big chunks repeated. It made no sense to stumble through the next handful of pages, or try to read beyond: love the photos, but can't keep the book.None of the other reviewers here mention finding this mess. Are there different printings out there?"
3,wheel,"the wheel is pretty nice, but I hope another company puts a wheel out for xbox. It's the same quality as any other Mad Catz accessory, nice but could be much better. and it doesn't have a clutch, like the ... above put. I'd love to see a manual set of racing wheels on any console"
4,Sturdy low-cost wheel,"This is a very good racing wheel for its price. Its sturdy, easy to adjust, and give that added realism to your racing games. Before this, I tried the Logitech Nascar wheel at twice the price. The Logitech wheel wasn't as well built and was much harder to adjust reliably.There are better wheels out there, but if you don't want to spend over $100 on a game controller, get the Mad Catz wheel."
1,"Could be great, but...","I tried both the XBOX MC2 and the Universal MC2 on my XBOX with similar results: the XBOX wheel would disconnect at least once in every game, though I was able to press start to resume- with the Universal, the wheel would just lock up and the console had to be powered down completely. I could not even begin to recommend this wheel due to the inconvenience of this issue that seems to be pervasive, reading all of the comments here and on the internet."
3,wheel,"the wheel is pretty nice, but I hope another company puts a wheel out for xbox. It's the same quality as any other Mad Catz accessory, nice but could be much better. and it doesn't have a clutch... I'd love to see a manual set of racing wheels on any console"
1,thanks for the reviews,I was just about to buy this wheel until I decided to read the reviews. Thanks to all reviewers for your input. I'll look around for a different wheel. I just picked up Midnight Club2 and need a wheel. So far I've bought 2 items from MadCatz and they've worked fine. You win some and you lose some I guess.
1,amazon.com screwing,i waited over 2 months for my racing wheel and after my shipping date was changed on me they sent me an email saying they didnt even have the product. not backordered or delayed but no product. 2 months of waiting to get screwed by corprate america. this company is really screwed up!!
1,mc2 raceing wheel,did not like it because all of the features did not work and did not perform as well as i thought.
5,Xbox MC2 Racing Wheel,"This thing is so phat.I'm buying it today so i will know soon the feel of it(I'm so excited).I can't wait to play Progect Gotham Racing with it,hehehe."
2,F1 2001 Buyers beware,"Being a hardcore F1 fan, I eagerly anticipated playing F1 2001 with this wheel. However, the controller configurations for F1 2001 only allow you to select the A and B buttons or the triggers for upshift/downshift. Unfortunately, the butterfly shifters on the Mad Catz wheel correspond to the A and X buttons. So, semi-auto shifting has to be done with the A and B buttons on the wheel and are almost impossible to use correctly at speed. A major bummer!"
3,Good but flawed,"This wheel is good, but I am returning it. Frequently, an error message comes up on screen saying that my controller has disconnected. It happens at the worst times. I was better off using my controller."
5,'Really' AWESOME!!!!,This is by far the best racing wheel for xbox. I cant stop playing with it. Its highly addictive when combined with Project Gotham. This wheel is very comfortable and the and well built. The best feature is the gear shift which can tbe found on any other wheel for xbox and the rpm meter lights up on the wheel when you hit the gas. This is a must have for the racing inthusiast.
1,A great concept. Now if it only worked.....,"I've only tried it with project gotham so far, but even changing the settings on the wheel around, it's harder to control the cars with this stupid steering wheel than it is with the regular controller, because you can't decrease the wheel range far enough to handle the frequent cornering. If you were on a perfect oval track like stock car racing, it would probably be fine, but defnitely not designed or even tested much with the thought of actually steering something.If you insist on getting one of these, buy one used. at least that way you wont waste as much money."
2,The bare minimum if you need a wheel and pedals.,"Currently, there are only THREE options for XBox if you want a steering wheel/pedal arrangement. The super-expensive Fanatec setup, the original Microsoft wheel (discontinued), and MadCatz. The Microsoft wheel is fragile and will not last. I had the MS Wheel, it broke and rather than spend hundreds on a Fanatec, I went with the MadCatz. It has NO FEEDBACK and it is otherwise a very basic setup. Steering resistance is a simple spring. Pedals work fine. The console is cheap looking. On a positive note, it has lasted quite a while."
3,Not so bad,Steering this thing gets a bit of getting used to because it's not as sensitive as the controller but as long as you're not having disconnecting issues(which i would take into count when buying this) this ups the fun factor on any compatible racing game. So far i know it works with Burnout revenge and nfs shift. It probably works with forza games to. I haven't had any disconnecting issues yet. I also have the recent(2010 at the time of this post) arcade 360 which might make a difference idk. all in all it's not bad i just wish i didn't get it from gamestop because they charge $100. for it!
4,"If you're going to include a stick, please let it shift.","Although the steering is much more realistic than the ""stock"" Xbox controller, the stick shift has nothing to do with reality. If you're going to include a stick shift, let it shift. There is so much attention to detail to each city and street, I am very surprised at the lack of realism to the feel of the game play. As a person who has driven stick shift all of his life (more years than I'm willing to admit), I find myself using the automatic transmition option because the manual is too weird. Although this seems to be this best controller out there for car racing, I' can't help feeling seriously disappointed."
4,Great wheel - one problem,"I've tried driving with just the handheld controller and I would crash at every turn - I guess I'm a creature of habit. I needed a steering wheel and foot pedals - the stick is an added bonus in my book since many wheels don't have one. The steering is great - I have to remind myself that these are race cars and not my regular car - by design they handle differently and that's fine. I'm still adjusting - but after the first lap I'm no longer crashing and am cutting my time dramatically with each race. I love it - except for one problem - I intermittently get a lost connection message in the middle of the race - just exit the message and the race goes on. I've sent a message to MAD CATZ Tech support in hopes of getting a resolution. It may be a problem with my unit - in which case I would gladly exchange it for replacement of the same wheel. When I get a response, I'll post it here. Happy Racing!"
1,Buggy,"Like others, I found that this controller doesn't work. It ""crashes"" every few minutes - halting the game and requiring the user to press the START button to continue.If it wasn't for this significant flaw, I would have given it a 5 star rating. However, this flaw makes it totally unusable in my opinion. It was returned to the store."
2,Almost but not quite,I went thru two of these wheels before returning it for a refund. It was a good wheel but I got this same disconnect problem others mentioned. About 5 times a race (I always found it disconnected during a race - never in menus) it would ask me to reconnect the controller. I never got a response from Mad Catz tech on this subject.
1,I can't believe a copmany would try to sell this!!!!!,"I just recieved this wheel for my xbox for christmas and couldn't wait to use it. Sure the wheel is cool and all but what good is a controller if it doesn't work. Yes I am talking about the controller giving me a disconecting error in the middle of a race and having to start over and it happens all the time!!! The wheel also has a very bad deadzone in the middle making it very inaccutare. Don't buy this wheel, you won't be able to play your games with it. I can not believe that a company can get away with selling this thing if it doesn't even work correctly!!! It looks like I am not the only one with this problem since a lot of other people have posted about it on here, and I am sure mad catz knows about the problem but has done nothing!! Nice try mad catz, this is the second of your products for the xbox that has screwed up on me, you will never get any of my buisness again! This thing is going back tommorrow."
1,did not work for me,"I experienced the same problem as many of the other reviewers. Every few minutes, I got an error message about my controller being disconnected. There was nothing wrong with the cables. The only solution was to press Start every time it happened in order to continue the game. That got annoying very quickly! I bought my wheel at a local electronics store and took it back the next day. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one until Mad Catz fixes their product."
4,Not bad,"I really really like disc 2 of this CD better than disc 1. disc one is not mixed that well (in my opinion) i think the two guys of full intention should focus more on producing tracks rather than mixing (no offense) there are AWESOME tracks on both of the CD's, but they mix them so quick and choppy that you really don't get to feel...or hear, the full effect of each track, which kinda pisses you off when your listening to it. nonetheless, im glad i have this in my collection."
3,Delayed release should tell you something,"This film was originally released as ""Sappho"", in 2008. The delay of release in the US should tell you something about the quality of the film - it's only okay.With the title ""Sappho"" you know where this film is going. In case you don't Sappho was an Ancient Greek woman who is supposed to be the first celibrated lesbian. In fact she was from the island of Lesbos and her island's name gave us the term lesbian.Set in the 1920s, Avalon Barrie plays Sappho who is recently married to Phil (Todd Soley). They arrive on a Greek island. Soon Sappho gets bored with how her hubby makes love and she is seduced by Helene (Lyudmila Shiryaeva) who plays the daughter of a Russian historian.The woman are beautiful. The plot is flimsy and predictable."
2,horrible. don't waste your money.,"this film had so much potential. and for the first 30 minutes, the films was intriguing. then it just got surreal and stupid. it is so sad, bc the colors were rich and the cinametography good - yet the storyline was weak and dysfunctional, and the characters shallow. Also, the blonde woman is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. She is what breaks the film. Pity."
1,bad bad bad,"The theme is basically, girls only use other girls to learn how to please boys, for ""practice"", and/or to keep hymens intact for future husbands. The girls that fall in love with other girls only do so because they are crazy and want to be boys. In the end, boy gets girl and all is right again.... this movie sucked. Maybe you will like the story, but being a lesbian, it just made me sad."
1,Sooo bad!,Acting was bad.Plot was TOTALLY unbelievable.The female lead was obviously crazy which lead to an insane plot line.Movie had a weird overly dramatic / unbelievable ending.Please don't waste your time or money!
3,Lessons from Lesbos,"While ""Summer Lover"" is by no means a profound motion picture, I found it to be intriguing for several reasons: First, it advocates a free, sensual pagan lifestyle which is fascinating to consider and explore; and second, it challenges (even mocks) Christian beliefs which condemn free love and a diversity of human sexual expression. Yes, it's all rather badly acted, but there are moments and some good lines of script. The production values are strong and the geography is expertly used to illustrate the theme. The two women performers--who play bisexual lovers--are very attractive (the 'eye candy' aspect of this movie is worth men taking a peek).It is an uninhibited erotic fantasy you might like to share and discuss with a lover--if you dare to open this Pandora's Box!"
3,Summer Lovers,"This movie does remind me of Summer Lovers (1982), I liked the old one form the '82 movie better than this Summer Lover. Summer Lover gives me a little creep. Sappo is insane, she was fine all along before she arrives to Greek Isle of Lesbos. I kinda think Helene ruined Sappo's mind turned into insane twist and obsession. I wish Sappo's husband should have taken Sappo and himself back to where they are from. None of this would have get worse."
2,Too generic.,"I found the book to be a decent overview, but too general to be of assistance. A better document is the TLC FAQL written by Rob Mullen and found on-line at off-road.com. There are some errors in the info as well. For example, he lists the 3.0 l V6 as being an interference motor when it isn't."
1,Toyota truck and land cruiser owner's bible,"If you at all care about classic Toyota engineering, don't get this book. Basically I was not expecting much except a good historical perspective on toyota trucks and land cruisers. However, all of the photos in the book are ""modified"" trucks and land cruisers with ugly ""after-factory"" wheels and tires. These trucks are disturbing to the pure toyota person to look at. Also, the engine section is based around building a chevy 383 for an fj-40. Hardly worth reading. In short, Moses Ludel is a chevy guy giving you information on how to ruin your Toyota."
3,A good history and overall review of the Toyota truck line.,"Although this book is not for someone looking for a repair or maintenance manual, it does serve a good purpose of explaining the evolution of the Toyota truck line. It details the changes to the vehicles over the years and is most helpful for someone looking to buy a specific older vehicle that has certain features."
2,General Level,"I purchased this book but discovered it's not current, even for my 2002 Toyota Tacoma 4WD I believe this book just reaches 1999/2000s, and now there is a redesigned Tacoma with bigger engines and SIX speed transmission. On general level it covers some good points and has useful info, but lacks in specificity. I wanted to change my front brake pads, an easy thing to do, but found nothing in this book to help me. Definitely has potential for a totally updated book."
5,Learn to be a practitioner of TRIZ using this book,"The best book on TRIZ that is out there IMNSHO, and I've read most of the English version TRIZ books, I would recommend it hands down to all beginner, intermediate, and Advanced Systematic Innovation students.My hat is off to TRIZ Master Victor Fey and Mr Rivin, they have done a service to all who want to learn the real basis for TRIZ (The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) methodology and apply it effectively.These guys have done it, and show others how its done.Richard Platt(former) Intel - Global Innovation Program Manager and Senior Instructor for Innovation Methods"
5,One of the best TRIZ ref book,One of the best TRIZ reference book for a beginner. Fey and Eugene attempted to simplify the complext TRIZ concepts in simple and plain English for the mass. Whoever I recommended the book (non TRIZian's) reall falling into the TRIZ world now. My TRIZ learning has reached to the next level with the help of this book.
4,Great!,"Very interesting book! Never head of TRIZ till my class but I ended loving this class. It took me a while but once the understanding hit, everything made so much sense!"
4,A Great Book!,I took this book on vacation thinking I could pick it up & put it down as activities permitted. Wrong! I finished it before we got to our destination because I couldn't put it down! I'll be waiting for the next one.
1,Vanity Press published--don't buy if you like good writing,"I should have known. This book was self-published, which most times means the manuscript is not good enough to be accepted by an established publishing house. I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased it. The author's family and friends obviously wrote the reviews. Not even great mystery writers like Michael Connolly, John Sandford and Harlan Coben get five-star ratings. The writing was amateurish, the characters one-dimensional and the plot (or plots?) out of seqence, if that is possible. I didn't even finish the book--just didn't care what happened. From now on, I will check the publisher on the book before I buy."
1,Very poor,"This novel is poorly written, with unconvincing characterization and unbelievable plotting. In some places there is too much detail, in others not enough. Instead of having the characters demonatrate their feelings or thoughts, the author told us. The whole thing just did not hang together. I own this book now but not for long!"
5,Can't put down,"I tried putting the book down at least 4-5 times the day I got it, but couldn't. It was thoughtful, interesting, and offered enough intrigue to keep you going. Much like the old Columbo series, the villain(s) seemed obvious, but the resolution was not. Great weekend read!"
5,Liked the ending,"We really enjoyed The Dead Angel. Nancy: I liked the ending. It was different! Lynne: It's a real page turner. I kept thinking I had things figured out. Wrong!! Friend Ethel is reading it now. So far she loves it!! Congratulations on a great first book, Carolyn!!"
5,Loved this book!,"I don't know the author personally, but the person who recommended this book to be does know her. I'm thrilled to be one person away from knowing such a talented writer. I found this book extremely easy to read, but also one I had to think about as I read it or I would get lost. The author gives the reader lots of clues without coming right out and telling you everything. I found that having two story lines in the book a challenge as well, but it made for more interesting reading and the author ties the two together beautifully. I understand Ms. Hill is writing another book. I hope it will be out soon."
1,"One star for the effort, what little was put in.","I read this book and stumbled upon someone elses review of it here on Amazon. Someone who is obviously in Mr. Zipper's pocket.This book is slow. One could read 30 pages into it and forget completely what was written on the page. The paper for Mr. Zipper's book would be better used in a hamster cage.No plot. No story line. No passion. Just dull words on a page.A good book to fall asleep with, if your goal is just that."
2,ViewSonic E90FB and Cell Phones,"My employer just replaced an aging NEC monitor with this larger View Sonic. It is nice and bright and much flatter than what I had before, but not perfectly flat. Also, it appears to be extreamly sensitive to cell phones, particularly my Blackberry. Even with the Blackberry placed a considerable distance from the monitor, on a regular basis severaly thin black lines will flicker across the screen which is quite irritating. The other thing I have noticed is that even though this monitor is larger, I still get the same resolution. I haven't found a higher resolution output that works well with this screen yet."
2,ViewSonic E90FB 19,"I can't wait till I have enough money to by another monitor. This ViewSonic(E90FB 19"") is dark and it rolls like a bowling ball, I have tried everything to get this to work so I can tolerate it. No refund or exchanges were offered to me when I called them up. I have two othe computers that use trintrons and they are perfectly clear,These viewsonics are greatly overrated and I will never buy one again."
2,not as expected,It is obviously too much to ask to find a toaster that lasts! I have been through several with this being the latest. The heat setting is stuck and cannot be adjusted. The handle fell off. Small appliances used to be built to last. My grandmother has had her toaster for YEARS! This started having problems after 6 months! Beware. Look for a better model.
4,"Great product, terrible instruction manual.","The unit performs very well. The instruction manual is almost useless. No feature can be accomplished from the page it is featured on, you have to ""fish"" the entire manual for the missing parts of the puzzle. There is no glossery, so again, fish the entire manual for critical information.Having said that, the recordings are great and play in every dvd unit I have. Nick G Austin Texas"
4,Does What it's Suppose to,Don't make the mistake that i made. Order a box of 100 blades when you purchase ezrip. That way the shipping will be FREE. I thought I'd be able to save money and buy the blades from my local hardware store-but they only carried the 5 pack. The tool does come with five additional blades; but it takes more than 10 blades to remodel your home!
2,"Poor organization, not much depth","The book is organized alphabetically by the chinese slang words, which is not useful to me. I can imagine this being useful if you speak mandarin well and are trying to figure what somebody was saying, but for a reasonable new student, this organization killed the book for me.Each phrase or word is given only a short paragraph of description, and there is almost no other text. It is very dry.The computer terms at the end are useful since they are sorely missing from every other chinese reference I've seen. The book could be worth it for that.If you're looking for an introduction to Chinese slang, get Wang's other slang book, Outrageous Chinese, which is excellent."
5,Fantastic camcorder,"I'll leave the techno-speak to those who care about how this camcorder operates. However, what I will say is that it's very easy to use, light, compact and has an amazing picture quality. Obviously it's expensive, particularly if, like me, most of the time it will be used to film the kids. However, it's a quality product and the latest model, so you have to expect to pay a premium. Only gripe - for this price they could have thrown in a firewire cable, but that's nit-picking.Before long, everything will be High Definition and you'll be glad you bought it."
4,Very Nice HiDef Camcorder,"Sony did it again.This is my third Sony from D8 to MiniDV and now Hidef. I usually do lot of research before buying anything and for camcorder typically Sony is always the winner. I have been using this for over 3 months now.Good: Compact, almost no noise as in it does not record the motor noise along with sound as some of competitors do, terrific colors and clarity. Worth the price for every centBad or not so good: being too light shakes a lot or should I say you need to be careful. Low light is not good which is always the case with Sony consumer or as a matter of fact almost all the consumer camcorders.Overall I am satisfied with this camcorder and recommend it. Now HC5 and HC7 are also out and price for HC3 has gone down as well.Do your research and see what fits your needs and go for it. Save your memories in Hidef, the way to go - all the best."
5,Excellent and reliable,"The first use for this HD camcorder was to record for an hour total of childbirth and bringing the baby home. Lighting varied from dim in labor/delivery to bright in ordinary rooms and of course outdoors. The first material went into iMovie and then to iDVD and produced top-quality HD images on a 50-inch screen.Some people worry about low-light performance. Yes, it is dim and grains out slightly in very low light. Check the Hollywood movies or TV journalism when they are using ambient, low light without hidden ""fill"" lighting. What do you expect for $1,050???? (Down $50 from when we got it.)Highly recommended. Wait for the inevitable new one if you must, but strongly consider this one at that time as its price should fall below $1,000."
5,Amazing Video Camera,This HD video camera comes in a conveniently small package and takes amazing video and photographs. The HD video is incredibly sharp and we especially enjoy the ability to take wide angle still photo shots. We took it to Italy for two weeks and my husband would not go anywhere without it. We love it!
2,Good camera but way over-priced and notoriously terrible customer service,"This was a great unit when it came out, but now it's just WAY over-priced.Mine just died after 2 years, and I'd only used it about 15-20 times. Sony wants me to pay more than $500 for a flat-fee repair. Unbelievable.Do a search online -- the error message I got was really common, and MANY people got the same $500 assessment.I'll never buy Sony again."
5,Great camcorder that uses DV tapes for recording,"I wanted an HD camcorder but was turned off by the units that used a hd for storing the video, this unit took care of that. It uses the regular DV tapes you can buy just about anywhere. My experience with the battery has been very good but it wouldn't hurt to buy an extra. Video quality is great and playback is a snap since it has an hdmi output. The video quality DOES degrade when in a low-light situation. A good ""for instance"" would be when we went to the aquarium in Gatlinburg, the video of the fish was very sharp but when I panned to my family (who was lit only by the light from the tank) the video got grainy. The built-in flash is EXTREMELY strong. Only problem I've had with the camera part is that it doesn't always focus as fast as I'm used to so give it a second or two. I've transfered some video to my Sony VRDMC5 via the dv output and the quality is pretty good though down-converted. Price around...got mine for $399."
4,Met Buyer's Expectations,"The product showed on time and well shipped. I suspect the product box was opened. However, all materials were enclosed and were in ""Like New"" condition. The is an older model so I expected it. Thank you for the smooth and good transaction. Yes I would buy from this seller again. - John"
5,"Excellent product, you won't go wrong with it!!!","Image quality is exceptional, the weight it's light and the camera is full of features. My only complaint it's that after spending over a thousand dollars, the camcorder desn't come with a Firewire cable and the sound recording could be much better. In general,if you are not a professional you can buy this great camcorder, that you won't regret it."
4,The original story with the original script.,"This edition of King's short novel ""Cycle of the Werewolf"" not only features the original version (with Bernie Wrightson's excellent illustrations) but also the original shooting script for the film adaptation from Dino DeLaurentis, entitled Silver Bullet. This was King's final shooting script and it differs from the release print of the film somewhat (the werewolf sings a beer commercial jingle after the first attack, etc.). This edition offers an interesting look at Stephen King's incredibly diverse talents."
1,Will NOT fit a 2008 Mini S,"Just like the person who left a comment yesterday, I found these pads will not fit my 2008 Mini S Coupe. Wish she had left her comment a couple days earlier. I checked out EBC directly and found the proper part number is DP21789 for 'Greenstuff', DP31789 for ""Red'. Since Amazon doesn't sell this model of Green, I guess I will go with the Akebono EUR1308."
2,Two Stars for Art,"These recent books don't appeal to me because I think they're needlessly confusing with their varying fonts and font sizes. I can't imagine what children must think, although from the other reviews some children love them. I give the two stars for the fun artwork, but in looking at the artwork the story is cast aside. One day this trend will pass away, and I will be grateful."
4,Management Quick Look,We had a quick response need to generate a complex interconnection diagram and one person on staff with some experience with an ealier version of Visio. This combined with some serious Power Point and Excel capability (and Amazom overnight delivery) gave us good working second revision within 48 hours. So far we're very satisfied.
3,GOOD SHORT STORIES,"3 stories by Stephen King: ""The Reploids"", ""Sneakers"" and ""Dedication"".3 stories by Dan Simmons: ""Metastasis"", ""Vanni Fucci is Alive and Well and Living in Hell"" and ""Iverson's Pits"".1 story by George R. R. Martin: ""The Skin Trade"".While the stories by King and Simmons are more or less short, the story by Martin is long, taking up almost half of the volume.The only (almost) original story is ""Metastasis"" by Simmons, where a medical experiment lets a man see strange violet creatures (usually invisible) feeding on human beings like vampire slugs, causing cancer.""Sneakers"" is a ghost story, while ""Dedication"" is about urban witchcraft and ""The Skin Trade"" is a story about werewolves and investigation."
4,"Bought it for King, loved the Simmons","I bought this solely for the rare Stephen King story ""The Replicants"", which is good but feels more like a first chapter in a book that a short story (unresolved ending). The other two King stories are okay (""Sneakers"" being the better of the two, but both are published in Nightmares and Dreamscapes. The real treat here is Dan Simmons. I am more familiar with his sci-fi and mystery works, and was happily surprised by these stories which are more in the horror vein. ""Metastasis"" is an excellent story about what cancer really is a result of (with several revolting scenarios), while ""Iverson's Pits"" is an atmospheric piece that involves the corrupt legacy of an inept and cruel Civil War officer. If you like the period piece horror of ""The Terror"", you'll enjoy this long story. I didn't read the Martin novella."
4,joss stone ....solid as a rock..,"A (fairly) triumphant debut from the 16 year old(I know i cant believe it either!!) devon lass with the golden tonsils.I say fairly only from the point of view that some of the material here has been covered so many times its virtually transparent,however,young JOSS has managed to breathesensuality and 'soul'into the premier cuts here ,those being, her cover of the WHITE STRIPES 'FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY ,a stonking version of THE ISLEYS' FOR THE LOVE OF YOU and a real surprise in her cover of JOHN (LOVIN SPOONFUL)SEBASTIAN'S lovely 'I HAD A DREAM'.Quite astonishing stuff from a young lady with a,surely, glittering career ahead of her.Very highly reccomended."
4,Wow - what a debut,"Its hard to believe she is so young and its a debut album. Really enjoyed it. Thought the songs were well chosen (not perfect though) but the voice and confidence to use it from Ms Stone is remarkable. I think the producers knew it too as even thought she is very pretty, they sell the music, avoiding the usual marketing of image without substance. Bravo. Haven't heard this good a debut since ""Come away with me"". Believe second album is as good, so am looking forward to finding out. The"
5,Absolute Magic!,This is one of the best female vocalists I think Ive heard.The band is fantastic!Highly recommended!
2,Heartless 'Soul by numbers',"Ms Joss Stone has released an album which will impress anyone who follows American Idol or any of the Pop-Star manufacturing TV shows.The interpretations of the songs are overwrought and slightly hysterical. The album doesn't make for easy listening, nor does it provide much emotional depth.Ms Stone's singing style is a mix of the aimless Beyoncé-style vocal mannerisms and a desperate attempt to sound like a traditional Blues or Soul singer. The result is pretentious, irritating and unnatural.I don't like this album even though I have sat through it a number of times. The least graceful debut from a singer I have ever heard!"
2,Eh...,"I absolutely HATE some of the songs on this CD. They're either stupid, boring, or EXTREMELY boring. I doubt the original versions were as uninteresting as she makes them. On the other hand, Super Duper Love is a likeable, happy song, and a couple others are too... but they can't save the CD."
1,wow,"Hey I saw this video on MTV the other day.It goes to show that MTV continues to play unispired music. Compensating style over substance.Please, do the world a favor and avoid this CD like the black plague. She has potential, but this CD is going by it in the wrong way.I mean you figure she could've waited a while before she did a cover of a White Stripes' song. I mean she could've at least waited for them to die or go to rehab."
4,One Hot Little Chick!,"With a sultry and seductive sound for a 16 year old... it's hard not to let your mind wander. But catch yourself...,it's only good'ol funky music."
3,Watch out for this English Rose.,"I found this to be one of the best cd's I got in along time. ""Fell in love with a boy."" is the track that caught my ear. I can't get over the fact that she is only 16. As time goes by for Miss.Stone I am sure her choice of songs will grow. A great start for a future star!!!!"
3,"OK, but there are better albums - try Nellie McKay","I first came across Joss Stone by listening to ""Fell in Love with a Boy"" on VH1. That's the standout track on this album, and ""Super Duper Love"" is also good, but the rest is mostly filler. She really should not try to tackle Aretha Franklin at this early stage in her career. I would encourage people to try some of the authentic soul as reissued on Rhino rather than this record. While it's not soul, Nellie McKay's ""Get Away from Me"" is the best effort by a singer songwriter this year, and I recommend that disk far more than this one."
3,Does Anyone Remember Nikka Costa?,"This album is pretty great...I had no idea this girl existed until I saw her on On-Air with Ryan Seacrest, at the VH1 Divas thing. Until I bought this album, I seriously thought all of these were Nikka Costa's songs. They sound extremely similar. Joss is a great singer, but I'd say she was influenced by Nikka."
4,Great New Blues and Soul Singer,"Terrific ole school soul and blues Singer in the vain of Roberta Flack and Aretha Franklin. Her voice range impressive. Mix on the album not too good, as the background music is too low in volume to match her powerful voice. Bass weak too (no pops). Needs to be re-engineered. Overall you get the idea of who she is, an outstanding performer. Given the right original songs, solid funk or jazz bass tracks, and engineering mix, she could pop to the top and become a long term legend in soul. Great start! I want to hear more of her in more up tempo, soulful funk tunes."
5,a new generation of talent to applaud!,Joss Stone from the U.K. joins such artists as Canadian Allison Crowe and Americans Norah Jones and Serena Matthews as the new voices of music. All the promise of Soul Sessions should mark the start of a brilliant and long career.
5,Sounds like a refined Janis Joplin resurrection,"Anyone who has seen Joss Stone live and therefore heard her exceptional voice, will acknowledge that she's one of the greatest new stars on the music scene since Norah Jones. Joss' voice reminds us of Janis Joplin, but I would say that Joss' voice is more refined, especially at her age.Her debut CD ""The Soul Sessions"" is an absolute ""must"" for every music collection. The phenomenal thing is the tremendous range of her voice, the volume and the professionalism Joss' uses to exercise her rare gift."
3,Joss Stone The Soul Sessions,Love anything recorded by Joss Stone. Loved dealing with this seller as well. CD arrived on time and in great shape.
4,Dust in my eyes (and ears),"I have read several reviews of this disc and not one has mentionedDusty Springfield in Memphis. I am listening to Soul Sessions at the moment and cannot help but thinking of another white, female, British ""soul singer"", Dusty Sprinfield. Cheers to Joss. Keep on keepin on."
5,Today's Tina Marie - but better!!!,"Joss Stone what a refreshing sound!! This young lady will be around for a while. Her sound is almost historical, it seems that you have heard from her 25 years ago - and she is just 16! A friend turned me on to her by sending me a copy of Soul Sessions for my birthday. From the moment I scanned her songs I knew I was hooked. If I was back in the dance studio I would have problems choosing which song to choreograph to first. ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" asks if there is a witness - Here I am Joss. Stone has a sound that seems mixed with threads from Tina Marie, Macey Gray, Erika Badu, Sade but dyed, colored, and sewn together by Stone herself - how inspiring. And the last track is right on time, ""Living for the Love of You"". Just awesome! You go girl. Soul Sessions it definitely is."
3,Just my 2 cents,"I first heard her sing on VH1's Diva (Save the Music) program and I was impressed so I went and bought this Soul Sessions CD and to be honest, I was disappointed. No doubt, she's got a great voice, but my expectations were just not in line with the music on this CD.I loved her performance on VH1 because the music was upbeat. With Blonde, she sang Rapture and with Gladys Gnight, she sang Midnight Train to Georgia. It was brilliant."
1,crud,"Joss Stone is a talented child, but being able to replicate the sounds of a more mature vocalist doesn't mean a thing when there's no real engagement with the material. Stone oversings like an American Idol contestant (she was first noticed on the English tv equivalent), and every song on Soul Sessions has the same studied delivery and consequently sounds the same. Stone has obviously been nurtured carefully by a record company eager to sell a juvenile white equivalent to all the great black soul singers: ""look, folks, whitey can do it too!"" Putrid."
3,Let's be honest,"No doubt, this girl has an amazing voice. But she's just doing what black women have been doing for years and years--singing from her soul. She's good, but she's not upstaging anyone. Put her with Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and Beyonce Knowles and she'd be nothing special. Well all know where the hype comes from. Whenever someone white with blonde hair and blue eyes comes along and sings gospel or soul it's groundbreaking. Why? Because and ONLY because they're white."
1,Save Us From Anymore of This Tripe,"I've had a chance to listen to both Joss Stone albums and, believe me, that's enough. I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that said Joss has ""absolutely no range at all...she sings in the same style for all of her songs."" Melody takes a vacation and all Joss does is declaim soufully--over and over again. She truly can't carry a tune in a bucket. If you want to hear how ""The Chokin' Kind"" should sound, listen to the original Joe Simon version. The same with Betty Wright's ""Dirty Man."" These are great songs and Joss does a terrible job with both of them. Only rock illiteratti would praise Joss's remarkably failed covers. Or has everbody started taking crazy pills?"
2,Listen to Angie Stone instead,"I too saw Joss Stone on ""Ellen""...and I could not stop laughing.... here we go again, another white artist that thinks that all you have to do to be an R&B singer is put an bunch of african americans behind you in a band, have a few black back up singers, add some vocal gymnastics and....your an R&B SINGER!After listening to the ""Choking Kind""...I was the one gaging...she sounds like a little girl trying to imitate a real R&B singer. True R&B singers feel the music....that's why its called SOUL music, you can't imitate it folks, you have to feel it. One reviewer stated that he could not wait to hear what she sounds like when she turns 21. Remember Lisa Stansfield?Want to hear what it's suppose to sound like? Purchase Gill Scott, Angie Stone, or Casandra Wilson. If you know the difference....don't waste you bucks on this fluf."
2,"Good voice, weak album","Why cover a song and do a version that isn't even close to being as good as the original? Fell in Love With a Boy is just lame!!!! It's boring!! Not creative!!!I have nothing personal against Ms. Stone, she's a decent singer, but this whole thing is just pure hype. She's hot, white, and sings like she's black. Sound familiar?Whoever produced this album needs to check themselves."
2,Unneccessary Adjectives,"Some of these reviews take it too far with the compliments. Joss Stone has a nice voice, but she doesn't sound like she has much training. A lot of the attention that she's getting is due to the fact that she's white and only 16. If she was black she would definitely not be getting this much attention. Talent at a young age is not as rare as some of u may think. And I've heard stuff ten times better than this from people of the same age. If I heard a 45 year old black woman sing like this, I would be pretty disappointed. There is a lack of dynamics and change of tone quality in her singing. At times she is over singing. Is she better than Christina Aguilera? Although Christina sings incorrectly at times, she is better at expressing herself vocally. However, if u want to listen to something better than pop that's creative, expressive, and unique, just pick up a Jill Scott, Amel Larriuex, or Erykah Badu cd."
1,what a load of,"*please feel free to contact me with your review of my review*ok can I just say the first thing I heard by Joss Stone was Fell In Love With A Boy - cover of White Stripes song - on the radio. It took my breath away. BECAUSE IT'S SO GODDAMN CRAP. honestly. completely ruined a classic song, not just a White Stripes song, a pure rock classic. exchanging the sketchy rocky screams to soulful 'ah ah ahhhs' sounding like she has a stick up her ass is not what I call talent and ooh get her she's 16 - Alicia Keys was 14 when she wrote some of the songs on her album, so Joss singing at 16 is not phenomonal. oh Joss Stone your cover of White Stripes reaches my soul - and kills it too. it makes me want to cut off my own ears and the last song to do that was Celine Dion so you're in trouble. oh and can anyone explain to me why when I searched Joss Stone on Google recently all the results were porn?"
2,Boring Songs \ Nice Voice,"OK, I was visiting another message board and everyone was hyping this 16 year old British singer. I'm open to music and questioned why they liked her so much. I got such words as amazing, better than such and such, I was like wow. Well I got a copy of the CD yesterday and popped the CD into my car, which I often do, and I could not stop hitting the skip button. Sorry, the music was just boring, sounded very much like country\elevator music, I just didn't like the CD at all. In all fareness to Joss, she has a nice voice, but she didn't quite have the ability to gently glide into the R&B\Soul genre just yet, or maybe it could of been the song selections."
1,psh........,"Notice how this girl sings like some sort of Jim Henson creation? ... the sort of self-imposed muffling of her own voice in an attempt to sound soulful? Yeah, talented singers don't do that."
4,Looking Forward to Future Releases,Her voice is absolutely amazing. You can tell she doesn't really identify with the songs now though. I am looking forward to releases from her as she grows. It's a good album overall.
5,Soulful.......Sexy.......Sultry.......Simply the Best!!,"This is one of the best CD's that I have ever heard! The songs are so intense and smooth. I cannot believe that she is only 16!...Joss Stone has quite the career ahead of her and I, for one, will be buying all her cd's. She is amazing and truly gifted. BUY this CD!! You will not be disappointed."
5,Awesome,"Just when I was thinking that I had to wait till December for a ""must buy"" cd - Alicia Keys, here comes Joss. I was a little skeptical when I saw a brief clip of Joss on MTV but after hearing her sing live on GMA, I rushed to order her cd and am not disappointed. Her voice is beautiful and I love a recent quote of hers when asked why she doesn't just sing pop music since she looks like a pop star. She replied ""I don't like pop music. If I tried to sing it, it would not be real."" YOU GO GIRL!!!After a summer of bland r&b/pop, it is soooo refreshing to hear a new artist with such great music. I wish her all the success in the world and can't wait till she releases another album."
4,MTV this ain't,"Only that's good. Let's see there are some one star rates from people who thought a 16 year old was going to put out the usual crap and were disappointed, and some oldsters who are upset that anyone would do a cover of their favorites. This is one of the best female cd's since relish as far as I'm concerned. She has an original material cd in the works and I sure hope its not some sell-out to mtv level materail. Buy this and you will be glad you did. Watch for her next one. Tis is a voice that is bound to get better and better."
5,The Janis Joplin of the 21st Century,"I just heard tracks from ""Soul Sessions"" by Joss Stone performed live on the radio (WFUV FM) and was blown away, Wow!!! Her voice is amazing! It's almost as if Janis Joplin was reborn in her. The band, choice of songs, reworks and production are top notch. ""Soul Sessions"" will truly become a classic album!"
5,Joss's Album Set My Soul On FIRE!!!!!!,"I love Joss Stone's Album!That girl knows that she can sing!!!Joss is one of the best white Soulful Artist Ever!!!!She knid of sounds like Aretha Franklin.She is like the next Aretha Frankiln.My favorite songs on her album is The Chokin' Kind,Super Duper Love & Some Kind Of Wonerful!!!!She has a very great singing voice like that even though she's British.Joss Stone you Got It Going On!!!!!!"
2,"Lots of hype, but very disappointing album.","I was very excited to hear this album, but very disappointed once I did. Stone's voice is undeniably good, but she whines her way through most of the lame, drawn-out songs on the album. Another reason I bought the album was because many reviewers hailed Joss Stone as ""a young Aretha Franklin."" Now that I've heard the album, comparing Stone to Aretha is laughable. I would advise you to definitely not waste your money on this album."
2,Disappointed,I didn't like the CD. The original artists were better.The songs are slow and unexciting. I wish I hadn'twasted my money. I have no desire to listen to theCD again.
1,"finally, someone tells it like it is!","thank you, Industry Insider - with so many people blowing smoke about Joss Stone, it's misleading to music-buyers, and, it may even be misleading the young singer and hurt her potential of having a genuine singing careerwhy can't the industry Svengalis allow a talent like Stone to be real? instead, they take her voice and use it to create an imitation of soul - it's more marketing, hype and carefully-crafted illusion than it is musicthere's no more honest review than Industry Insider has written, so, I'll just add, I hope Joss Stone recovers from the manipulations of her puppeteers, and the folks who foist these manufactured ""products"" on an eager public will go and put their talents to selling something that they can be honest about - like used cars"
1,Britain's answer to Hillary Duff,"Joss Stone has reinterpreted a handful of songs, adding her own touch of ""Soul"". Apparently adding soul means changing a few lyrics and singing uninspired, because this album has nothing to offer in terms of substance. Hillary Duff is an american manufactured singer advertised through MTV to sell albums to kids who dont know any better, and Joss Stone is no different with the exception she's British. Ultimately, what you're left with is a ten dollar disc more suitable as a coaster than for spinning in a cd player, especially if one of your favorite songs has been chopped on this cd."
2,More Oversinging By a Teenager,"What a dissapointment this disc is...after reading all these glowing reviews. Poor Joss Stone is just another talented young singer who thinks it is cool to sound like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion or Mariah Carey by doing a bunch of vocal acrobatics. You don't have to stretch the word ""love"" into ""luh-uh-uh-uuuh-ve"" to be a good singer. Joss Stone over-sings and tries too hard to prove she can sing...someone needs to give these young people an Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holliday album so they can learn what real singing is. Just because one can do all that vocal gymnastics, scales stuff, does not mean they should. Not quite as bad as Christing Aguillera, but close."
4,"Very Entertaining and ""New Retro""","Joss Stone's voice is great and it's a great fit for what she is doing on this album. She makes each song her own and can get away with what sounds like inexperience at times. She makes up for sounding ""new to this"" by sounding ""new to this""!! Her energy and obvious enjoyment at singing a lil' soul comes through. An example is ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"". Usually when you change the gender of the subject of a song it comes out contrived and often silly sounding. Well, much in the way Janis Joplin made ""Me and Bobby McGee"" about a man, Joss stone flips the pronouns here as well. The song is different enough and her voice makes you believe the song was written that way from the start. Would I say she can sing with the best of 'em? Not yet, but this is sure an enjoyable first shot. Don't take it to seriously and think your getting Aretha. If you don't drive around bobbin' your head to ""Super Duper Love"" you just don't have the soul."
3,Great for Joss Stone fans,"I'm not a major fan, but love her voice. I only have one that I consider a favorite.If you are a fan, Joss does't disappoint."
2,so what?,"She's got a great voice, there's no debating that. But she doesn't have the experience or producers to realize the full potential of her talent...yet. I'd love to hear her in four or five years. When she finds her own style, and gives up trite runs, and stops overselling a song she will be a force to reckon with. For now unfortuneately she's only a novelty; but hopefully she won't be lost in the shuffle and someday we'll get to hear her sing her own material."
1,Overrated!!!!,"I really don't understand all of the fuss over some 16 year-old blond singer from England. As far as I am concerned, she is only another white singer trying to sound black and she does a very poor job with it. None of the tracks grabbed me and at many times, I felt that she was straining her voice trying to reach the high notes. I wouldn't classify her as 'soulful'. If anything, she should be compared more to Canadian singer Amanda Marshall. I give her credit for not marketing herself along the same lines as Britney and Christina. She needs to develop her own style rather than trying to 'fit' in with the black divas of the world."
2,"Okay voice, but doesn't make up for lack of talent.","I know it's kind of hard to tell at first but, Ms. Stone's first main single off this album (""Fell In Love With A Boy"") is nothing but a poorly done White Stripes cover. She expects to succeed with her first main single as a cover. Bands rarely do well with their first release featuring a cover. Look at bands like Orgy, Dynamite Hack, and Alien Ant Farm. One of the only bands that has had a career beyond their cover is Limp Bizkit. Their cover of George Micheal's ""Faith"" was on their last good album ""Three Dollar Bill Yall$"". After that album, they forgot where they placed their talent. Joss Stone has a pretty voice, but you're better off buying a Nikka Costa album."
2,Nope not even Close (too many adjectives),"Wow, based on all the 4 and 5 stars reviews this woman received I thought for sure I was going to get a quality CD. Psych, it just kills me to hear\read the comparisons made simple because she is suppose to be singing soul\R&B music. Again I say NOPE not even close...now we all know of some of today's good artist, like Angie Stone, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and India, all well deserving of R&B. But guess what there are other R&B ladies out there well deserving of all the adjectives you all bestowed on Joss Stone. Don't get too hyped, as if she the next best thing to sliced bread, simple because she is British, white and 16. Try listening to Vivian Green, Rhian Benson, Lizz Wright, Heather Headley, Ms. Abenna, and you'll see Joss Stone ain't nothing special in the R&B arena...NOT EVEN CLOSE on this CD...Joss has a nice voice think she would do better making and singing her own music rather than comvering so many songs...."
5,Amazing,"I enjoy many types of music--this is an amazing cd.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys different types of music, but hasn't jumped into soul yet-----jump in, you won't be sorry."
5,SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE,"I highly recommended this clearly and concisely written book. Mary Ellen Flora delivers information about clairvoyance that is simple as, I believe, all basic truth is. I have search many years for practical spiritual information with applicable and, most importantly, effective techniques to know myself. This book hits the target precisely. A refreshing and welcomed breath of neutrality!"
5,Thanks for telling us about grounding!,What a fantastic concept. We love grounding - thanks for sharing such a simple but yet powerful concept. This book is recommended for anyone interested in finding out that clairvoyance is not the magical mystical crap that we might imagine. I also read Male and Female energies and liked the concepts there too.
1,More Loads of Cult Rubbish,"Wanna learn about joining a cult? But this book and you to can embark on the path to the author's mind control cult.Wanna learn about clairvoyance? Click on any one of the sponsored links above. You'll get more info, won't waste money, and won't have to worry about being lured into a cult."
1,Amazing Reviews From Team Zombie,"It's amazing what an author can do when she has a team of zombies at her disposal. Trust me, don't waste your time with these ridiculous books. If you truly want to be clairvoyant trust yourself and your visions. That's all these silly books will tell you to do and now you don't have to shell out the money to learn that! All these books are are recruitment methods for the author's so-called ""psychic school"". But them and you too can be forced to write reviews for crap books--not because you want to, but because the author tells you ""Jesus says so."""
1,You Already Know What's In This Book,"At least that's what the author claims. Despite that fact however, she manages to put together page after page of boring visualizations that really help nothing. All the author does is explain that clairvoyance comes from the French meaning ""clear-seeing"" and that seeing clearly is all clairvoyance is. She does not give any helpful tools for developing that sight. Pretty much all she tells you to do is trust what you see in your mind or feel in your body and that's it. I don't disagree with that notion--I do disagree with charging people money to get it."
5,Classic,bought this to replace the exact same watch that I bought in 1993 and was still wearing --- only problem with the old one was a very scratched crystal from everyday wear for a dozen plus years! The only other moon/sun dial watches I could find on line started at four figures... This is a classic and a great buy! Timex -- please don't change it!!!!
1,This watch is for VERY petite adults!,"The only watches I have ever owned over the years are Timex, so I was very excited about ordering this beautiful watch. You can imagine my surprise when I got it and it looked like it would fit a child! I could barely get it on the first hole. It's going back immediately. Please do not buy it unless you have a very petite wrist otherwise it will NOT fit."
2,"Nice, but flimsy","The band was NOT too small for a normal sized adult woman, as has been previously stated. Once the band was a bit worn in, it's very comfortable and light enough that it doesn't interfere with movement.I bought this a year ago, and unfortunately, the band is now broken. It wore out and just fell apart.Also, it is not a moon phase watch. It just shows you AM/PM with a sun or moon graphic. It will NOT show you the outside moon phase, so if that's what you're after (as I was), sorry, no luck."
3,Too small! - Timex Women's Leather Moonphase Watch #T27901,"The watch itself is attractive and appears to keep time consistently. But, don't buy this item for anyone that does NOT have the wrist of an 11 year-old girl! From my observation, the band appears to be on the short side."
2,Not a watch for us who wear cheaters!,"I purchased...then summarily returned. It was a moment in my life where I felt my age. Without my reading glasses I could not get my wrist far enough away from my eyes to read the face of this watch. Sad, but true. Amazon does not sell arm extenders."
3,Timex Watch,"I was looking for a moon phase watch... ie. a monthly showing of the different phases of the moon..On this watch, the moon comes up at night and the sun in the day. It was also a smaller size watch than I was expecting."
4,Moon-phase Timex watch,"I was so happy to receive this watch. I had one years ago with a larger face by Timex. I have a small wrist and it is perfect for me!!Of course,keeps perfect time!Sometimes,simple and understated is the way to go.The Moonphase feature is so unique! i will probably go crazy and start collecting Moonphase watches!!"
4,A watch with character at such a low price!,"This watch has so much character that I am pleased every time I put it on and I've had it for a good 6 months now. This is my weekend watch and I do housework, gardening, ocean swimming and leisuring with it. My stylish 16 years old daughter even borrows it now and then. If your wrist is more than 6 1/2inch or 17cm in diameter, then this watch is too small for you.I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 because the only complaint I have about it is that the leather strap can be of better quality. Also, the 2nd loop is a bit too big and look like it can come undone, but so far,it's fine. But, hey you can't expect perfection at the price that it is. The time piece is beautiful! I hope they don't discontinue it."
3,This can be very useful,"This is not something you don't have to have but I myself have on and was very satasified with it, because when my Xbox was struct by lighting my games were all lost on the Xbox hard drive but I had them on my memory card and so when I got my new Xbox I still had my games that were saved.In my case the memory card proved very useful."
3,"Looks nicer than a CRT, but . . .","This a stunning-looking new toy -- nice, big, bright and shiny -- but I would caution anyone currently using a CRT that motion is not well displayed on this unit. Video clips at the tiny size currently on the web appear grainy and fuzzy. Even panning up and down on certain websites produces flickering results. The LCD just doesn't keep up with the motion. Also on many still images you'll see moire patterns..."
3,A quick read...,"It took me a day to finish the book. Jennifer Crusie is one of my favorite romance authors. This isn't her best work, and there were a few parts that made me laugh out loud. Linc was a jerk for most of the book and if Daisy was true to herself she would have never changed because of a man. Well I have started reading Manhunting so I will give a review on that in a few days."
5,Romantic comedy at its best.,Classic Jennifer Cruise. Quirky real life characters and wonderful romance. This really is a story to make you feel good.
1,boring,"This book is boring. It was recommended to me and the person who recommended it said that it was super funny. I am struggling to get through it and find any of the funny parts. The characters are subpar, the plot is silly and the story just does not read well or quickly enough. I'm bored with it but will finish it as that is how i work. I would not recommend this book at all to anyone."
4,A delightful book filled with humor.,"Linc Blaise, history professor, tells a tiny falsehood in a job interview. Daisy Flattery, artist, is his flamboyant downstairs neighbor and she is broke. When Linc is invited for a second interview and is told to bring his fiancé with him he has a problem. His problem ... a fiancé is the falsehood. The solultion ... Linc offers to pay Daisy if she will be his conservative fiancée for the interview. Daisy plays her part so well the powers that be like her so well Linc receives a job offer. The new plan ... when school starts in September Linc will tell the department head the engagement is over. The new problem ... the department head tells Linc to go make up with Daisy and marry her. The solution ... he talks her into an eight month marriage. Their lives become more complicated when Linc falls in love with Daisy and she falls in love with him."
1,Huge Disappointment for me,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Crusie fan. I have read ""Welcome to Temptation,"" ""Faking It,"" and ""Fast Women"" DOZENS of time. Stories are SO good, so well-thought-out, so FUNNY. This one is NONE of those. The characters are undeveloped. I just couldn't put a face on Daisy at all. No depth. In the beginning, she was portrayed (vaguely) as being free-spirited, independent, and interesting. She grew less and less as the story went on, and by the end, she was a a combination of June Cleaver and Stepford Wife. Linc was just an unlikeable man without a personality. No one else was even notable. In her other books, she made her characters so dimensional and fun - you could always count on witty dialogue and puns and references to pop culture. None of that. And what a dumb pretense of a story! In what WORLD would this actually happen? I'm putting this book on ebay with no minimum bid. Does that tell you anything?"
5,GIVE ME MORE,I listened to this book on CD and absolutely loved this book. The characters are so charming and the story pure fantasy and just fun. Great love story. Can't recommend highly enough.
4,Delightful read!,"I had never heard of this author before, but I was very entranced in the story immediately. I read it in one sitting, thoroughly enjoying each page. I definitely would recommend it to others!"
2,Just cannot recommend this book...,"To be honest with you guys? I just could not bring myself to even FINISH this book. And that's downright scandalous for a die hard Crusie Fan.This book is her earliest work re-printed an re-published. And frankly, shoulda been left in the closet.If you're a fan of Agnes and the Hit Man, Bet Me, Man hunting, and Welcome to Temptation?STAY FAR AWAY from The Cinderella deal. It'll break your heart it's so bad."
3,cute,"I'm a big Crusie fan, but this book didn't make it on my 'reread list'. It's still well written and has great whimsy in the characters. The characters are loveable and sweet. It is one of her earlier books and doesn't have the sharpness that I like in her plots and characters."
2,Not JC's best - SPOILERS,"I enjoy Jennifer Crusie; no one does snappy dialogue better.But I felt the heroine in this book was very self-absorbed. After being offered a temporary home - the marriage of convenience - she moves ALL of the hero's furniture out of sight and all of hers in - without even talking to him. It's not her house! He offered her a room to paint in, but she throws a fit about not being able to live in a ""sterile"" house. Again, it's not her house, but she demands that he change it for her.She paints HIS house the way she likes it.She puts up a nude picture of him in her show, and is hurt when he's upset about it.Why is HER way better? Because she's a ""free spirit"", she's allowed to tromp over his feelings? She's allowed to embarrass him in the name of romantic kookiness?"
3,"Same story, different title","I typically like Jennifer Crusie books but the plot of this is virtually identical to ""Strange Bedpersons"", and neither book is very good. Female leads in both books are labelled as ""Free-spirited"" and the readers are expected to forgive them any behavior based on that. Neither male or female characters are very likable. I periodically re-read my Crusie favorites (Getting rid of bradley, bet me, ...) but these will go to the salvation army--they weren't worth a first read, and certainly not a second."
4,"Jennifer Crusie ""Cinderella Deal""","Cute book! I love the way Jennifer Crusie writes. A little too many swear words for my taste, but her character development is great. Fun story."
4,First autism book?,"It's amazing how prescient this book is. To those of us with children on the spectrum, it's obvious Louie has some form of autism, and it's just impressive how forward thinking Keats was to write about it in 1975(!) when nobody even acknowledged the condition. I love the subtle way he presents Louie's differences and the other kids reactions to them. Very true to life. As far as the storyline goes, it's not that exciting, but any book written for children who are a bit different is fine by me!"
4,Solid,"This is a nice solid bag with room to spare inside for about 2 stands, some accessories like umbrellas and holder attachements, etc.. Construction is solid its made of nylon, it lacks heavy padding though, I use it just to carry things and I don't bang up my equipment so I'm fine with it."
4,Cover,Real simple cover. Protects my phone from scratches. The only problem is it sometimes covers the earpiece blocking some of the sound.
3,"its soft, but doesn't stay","This case had a cool color, and its so soft! Really people wouldn't stop touching it! The negatives: the top part (over the screens) Never stayed put when the phone opened. It would bunch and inch its way up, covering the speaker. Also, the screens themselves were not well protected. I cut film covers from my PDA to fit over all 3 glass parts and it did the trick ok. I also finally took a small rubber band, much like those used for braces, and it helped minimize the top part moving, but not by much!"
4,Honeycomb Coated with Milk Chocolate,"Violet Crumbles are a classic Australian candy bar: they've been around forever and are very popular over here. They consist of a fairly hard, but brittle bar of honeycomb coated in milk chocolate. And yes, they are delicious!They're also a lot like the (internationally) better known ""Crunchie"" bar. The main differences are that:1. Violet Crumbles have a slightly thicker outer layer of milk chocolate.2. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble is slightly harder and more solid, so it tends to shatter rather than crumble when you bite down on it.3. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble has a stronger honey flavor, with significantly more ""bite"" to it, so to speak.Note that Violet Crumbles can also be purchased in packs of six.Theo."
3,A good way to begin vegetarian cooking,"The receipes here are easy. There aren't any photos, so there isn't any way to view the finished product. I like the abundance of ethnic flavored recipes and soups. It's also nice to get information on how to soak beans and use tofu several different ways."
2,Just okay:,"Might be good for ideas for lower fat recipes, and there are several good recipes in the book, but I found most of them to be rather boring and ""ho hum""."
4,Great Service,Very good seller. Prompt delivery. Good deal. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
3,not an 'average' cookbook,"I was all excited when I found out there was a ww vegetarian cookbook. When I got it though, I found out that it is full of strange recipes, with items I dont normally have on hand. I was hoping for some yummy vegetarian recipes that seemed familiar. I live in a small town and I can not find some of the things they call for, like quinoa, millet, etc. There are a few recipes that are familiar, and I plan on trying them. If I had it to do again, I would not have purchased this book."
2,Weight Watcher's Vegetarian Cookbook,"This cookbook is okay if you love to cook. Many of the recipes have a lot of ingredients and take time to prepare. If you don't like to cook or you like to cook simple meals, this would not be the cookbook for you."
4,So far so good.,"So far so good... I agree that pictures would DEFINITELY motivate me to try more of these recipes! I already made the lasagne from the cover, probably because of the picture. Inside the recipes are just text. But if you're vegetarian and are trying to follow WW this is an unusual find!"
2,Weight Watchers Versatile Vegetarian,"This is the first Weight Watchers cookbook that has really disappointed me. I am not a vegetarian, but I do cook meatless meals on a regular basis. I have found much more appealing meatless recipes in other Weight Watchers cookbooks. Real vegetarians may find this book more useful than I did. The best thing about this book is that is does contain point values for all recipes under the new ""Winning Points"" program."
1,Disappointed,"Old, out-dated, disappointed, have to calculate weight watchers points, lacks pictures. There are a few, but highly disappointed in quality of cookbook, should be free to all"
4,Who's Got Game: The Aunt or the Grasshopper,A good story to help children learn about bullying behaviors & to illustrate that a little power can certainly go to one's head with disasterous results.
4,Ajoop. S,"Social Psychology by Robert S. Feldman is the prescribed textbook for my course. It's a good text with good, concise information. The anecdotes and experiments are very relevant and it is very easy to understand. But it took me a while to warm up to this text. I prefer using this along with another textbook like Baron's Social Psychology."
1,This book intensifies the meaning of redundancy.,"Social Psychology, 8th edition was very thorough, almost too thorough. The graphs were misleading in that the author sets them up to make it look like the results are extremely significant, when infact they're not. Also, concepts are stated with too many research examples that conflict with each other. They lack parsimony, and it leads readers to be even more confused about the concept after they read it thoroughly. The book followed a redundant pattern chapter after chapter that lacked stimulation."
4,great,"hi all, i am satisfied with the performance of this product. i can tell that its a best choise. i am strongly recommending this product."
4,owner,"It was a good phone. We used it only for 3 months. It may still need more time to find out more about these phones. We ordered 3 phones. One of them had to be replaced, provided by Amazon. Linksys had declined to provide service nor replacement."
4,good addition to your pulp library,"this collection contains a good deal of good stories like daoine domhaine and the church in high street. stories by campbell, lumley, copper, sutton..... not the most inventive stories i have read, but good storiess, well written. this is in fact one of the finest pulp collections"
1,Horrible Writing For Children,"Wow. I love how no one wants to say how this book teaches your child urban slang. Let's not even mention the complete lack of proper English. Apparently the writer has never heard of ""past tense""."
3,Shame about the fighting...,"We have this book at our local child care centre. I love the rhythm of the language and I love the illustrations and my little boy does too. What I don't like is the ""pow-pow"", ""I want to fight the baby"" part. It's not an idea that I want to encourage at all - some good natured wrestling can be fun, of course, but it needs a lot of explanation. All of the carers naturally substitute other words to illustrate the story; usually I say that the boys want to tickle the baby. Parents and carers who want to promote a less violent world should be aware of this."
3,About the brightness,"It is really darker than other monitors so that I always need to use third party software to make screen brighter.When u play game (like Counter strike, Doom3), if something is hiding in little bit dark place, u just can't see it. Doom3 doesn't let third party software to change brightness so I can't play doom3 although I have good enough system. It's just total black in doom3 even after u set brightness in doom3 setting to brightest. My friend has Viewsonic E95. His monitor is very good and bright too. So if you have E90 in mind, then just buy E95. It's few bucks difference."
4,Anolon Advanced Collection 52600 10-Inch Slicer with Hollow Ground Blade,"This knife is a steal at $50.00! Solid, sharp and good balance!"
3,Should be titled Luno,My only disappointment was this video contains 1 poochie special and 4 + Luno episodes. The Single Poochie video left me wanting more. I Loved Poochie in the 80's and still have my stuffed Poochie.
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"I read a book every week or so and Souls Raised From the Dead was a total waste of my time. There is nothing to like about any of the characters. I have had a son die from cancer and know what it is like to lose a child to illness. In the case of the dying daughter in the novel, I really didn't care and neither did anybody else. Everybody seems a bit mean spirited, busy with their sex-lives or drinking and they seem to be a reflection of the author, Doris Betts who acts like a babe in the woods with an ax to grind with religion in general and the Catholic Church in particular. She even makes a point to attack the church in her ""Note About The Type"" where she informs the reader that the Catholic Church even censored the use of the typeset adapted for use in printing the book. I am easily moved by authors when I can care for their characters. I will never read another book by this professor turned inquisitor."
1,Worst monitor I ever owned,"Without question, these are the worst monitors I have ever used. Our office owns four of these, and they are all terrible. We even had them replaced and the new ones are just as terrible. The colors are inconsistent, they constantly flicker, are out of focus, and every so often, they make this scary bzzzt sound, the screen goes blank, and everything resets. Yes, this is after adjusting the focus, color, and pincuscion controls. I will never buy another Viewsonic monitor, and recommend you avoid this particluar one at all costs."
1,Monitor with the worst quality - don't touch it if you can,"I bought three Viewsonic monitors over the past three years(PS790, GS790-2, and E771), and man, what a huge mistake! They are all dead now while ten-year old Dell monitors are still kicking.Don't expect it to last long, if you buy one. I will never ever buy any Viewsonic brand in my life time !"
4,Decent Upgrade,"For the home use for which I acquired this product, the upgrade is decent. I don't use most of it's functionality, but what I do use is very nice."
2,STOP! Seriously Consider Star Office 8 Instead!,"Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software."
2,Not their best...,"This Dk touch and feel book is not their best. It feels like they just slapped a few ideas together and didn't really try to come up with real-life, meaningful texture examples. I agree with the other reviewer who said it was repetitive; it is! Enough with the buttons already! Plus, the textures seem forced, like the best idea they had for ""fluffy"" is a pencil case? and ""shiny"" is a star that feels bumpy? The examples don't seem relevant to a baby's world.(...)"
2,Not a huge fan,Other DK Publishing Touch and Feel books are better. The Wild Animals one is the best we've purchased.
3,Too Repetitive,"My son is only 5 months old, and he seems like picking up all the book-like objects, so I don't know if he is especially interested in this book or not.As a parent's opinion, I like the different texture it offers to my kid to touch in the book, that's why I have bought quite some ""touch and feel"" style books for my baby. But I find this less perfect.I find this book not too creative and imaginative. They always use ""buttons"" as one of the examples of many shapes. For example, when they introduce circle, there are buttons; when they introduce square, there are buttons; and even heart shape, there are buttons. They could have chosen a greater variety of objects.""Cushion"" is another object that appears a lot. In both the square and in the star shape sections, there are cushions. I think they could have at least use star fish instead of cushion in the star shape section. That will help the kids to learn more about different things besides different shapes."
2,Not very creative in ideas; it doesn't hold a child's interest.,"This is a rather mediocre book. The tactile objects are bland and nothing really stands out. The artwork is also not creative or imaginative. Really can't feel the love, or creativity, or care, or gosh even any interest was put into designing this book and that comes through.I'd skip this one. I bought it used, so it is not a big loss, but I would not recommend it for the price of a new copy."
2,Touch and feel irrelevant,"Wasn't impressed with this product. The orange (the front cover picture) doesn't /really/ feel ""bumpy"" it feels more smooth with ridges. Some of the items seem out of a baby's Zone of Proximal Development. Like, ""Yes, let's touch the fuzzy pencil holder""...because babies have lots of experience holding pencils? A scratchy magic wand in the shape of the star? Why not have the puffy golden star like on the cover? At least that would have been interesting. Smooth sunglasses? (the book itself is smoother than the sunglasses...no texture change there.)The only fun exploratory ""touch"" item on there was the pillow cushion.I bought this book for my baby nephew. He'll play with it I'm sure, but next time I'm going with touch and feel books by actual authors like Melanie Mitchell"
2,Overrated,"While not a bad tool, I found that using a utility knife was just as easy and fast. I used this for the first few cuts and when I needed something the tool couldn't do (uneven cuts along a sheet), I used a knife, then by the end of the job was always using the knife. Save your money and buy a good utility knife, some extra blades and a good straight edge."
5,Very nice drywall ripping tool!,"I am very pleased with my purchase of EZRip. It really does make drywall scoring very easy, regardless of your skill level. It's as easy as pressing the locking button, selecting the setting, and making the rip. The telescopic design, spring controlled razor, rubber wheels, and convenient storage for 10 drywall blades are all very nice features. Considering all the time EZRip saves me, I feel it is a very worth while investment for anyone who has to cut drywall."
4,EZ Rip Drywall Cutting Tool,It worked very well on making horizontal cuts on sheetrock. I was pleased with how it worked since I was using 12 foot lenghts of sheetrock.
3,helps some,"Love it for long rips but it's gonna stay on the sideline quite a bit.A good drywall tool to have as an accessory but don't chalk it up as ""The job saver"".Still gonna use your knife most of the time."
5,very good,"uses special blades, no problem getting them though, if you want a straight cut use this thank you very much."
4,if only it had an epilogue,"like others, i anxiously read this book through to the end, hoping and expecting to find some explanation for the absurd violence visited on the protagonist by his three captors. and even though i had my own theories about 100 pages into the book, i kept looking for more clues, more links to ""my"" suspect. in the end, i expected an exposition, a telling of the tale without the guise and angst of the captured, but it was not there. i read the final sentence, ""go back to the beginning,"" as an instruction, a final clue, and so i did -- i went back a reread the entire first section, skimmed the rest of the book, in fact, and all i found there were the clues i had found the first time. so i'm pretty sure i know ""who done it,"" but i don't know why and i don't know how the others were connected to the crime. so in the end, i'm disappointed, but i did like the book very much and recommend it."
3,Cheated!,"To read this book is to feel cheated. The central event propels us toward a need for enlightenment and catharsis ... and we never get them. The truly emotional moment, the ""revelation"" we are waiting for (i.e. the protagonist telling someone the truth), never comes. I stayed with the character through his years of repression and dissociation, I wish I had been allowed to share in his *true* release."
3,The Stockholm Syndrome Plus,"What happens to the psyche after one has been imprisoned and sexually molested? And what if you are male? What if no one believes you? There arrives dissolution of trust in the world, and even in oneself. The tale held my interest, but I would have a difficult time recommending this book to a friend or loved one."
1,The literary equivalent of Cinemax after hours,Think early Bret Easton Ellis channeling Shannon Tweed. Then move on.
4,"If you like Kafka, Camus, or Anne Rice, this is for you!","The ""Book of Revelation"" is an appropriate title for this haunting, strange, disturbing, darkly funny novel. What is revealed here? In a way, not much, including details about most of the characters, or, even, an answer to the identity or motives of the kidnappers. In another way, however, a lot is revealed, or at least explored, in this novel, including issues of sexuality, power, memory, and even, in an Existential philosophy sense, the search for meaning in an absurd, chaotic world. Hints of Kafka (the Trial), Camus (the Stranger), Bowles (The Sheltering Sky) and even Anne Rice (her vampire books, for instance, explore many of the same themes). A fascinating, engrossing book, and one you will not soon forget."
2,Meh.,"I can't comment on the seller since I got this as a gift, however as the recipient and eager reader of the book, I can say that I was not impressed. The information this guide contains is really basic and obvious and some of it is even dumb. If you're interested in this book, keep looking for something more substantial that was written by a fitness expert and not some person sitting on their couch writing their first book."
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"This movie is so bad it didn't even qualify for a Redbox Kiosk, rather it was in the .99 cent quick sale box at a video store. That should speak volumes. It wasn't even worth that unless you think spending one hour and fifteen minutes watching (they couldn't find enough to fill the standard 90 minutes) of someone standing for the whole movie behind a video rental checkout counter renting and receiving VHS tapes (Yes, it's that ancient.) and exchanging juvenile insults with customers. Seriously, that's it and fortunately we have the use of FF."
2,HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY....,"DO NOT waste your money on this controller-- shell out any extra $10 and get a controller you will actually use. Bought mine at Gamestop, only controller they had (boo, Gamestop.) Thumstick STICKS and has no resistance, plastic feels cheap. Not very useful for shooter games when you need percise movement. I was so sick of mine I broke it in half in my hands. You just dont mess with a man and his video games lol. Never buy Mad Kat, too cheaply made."
2,Not as Advertised,"The controller for sale is not the one pictured. The controller is a 200 series and not a 400 series as pictured. There are no rubber grips on the sides and the thumbsticks are made of plastic, not rubber as on the control pad pros. That means that your thumbs easily slip off of the thumbsticks. It also doesn't have a turbo button. This is pretty much just a useless controller. It's okay for your friends if they come over but this should definately not be your main controller for the xbox. I recommend the 400 series which is what I thought I was getting. I have one and have used it so much that I have worn the rubber off of the left thumbstick. It served me well for about 3 years."
3,Mad Catz Xbox conltrol pad,The item received was not the item pictured. Item received did not have the turbo feature show on the item pictured... Other than that the controller works well.
5,awsome controller,MAN DIS IS THE SUFF RIGHT HERE. U CANT GET NO BETTER THAN DIS .DIS CONTROLLER IS PHAT.
3,Soak the beans!,"This product has potential to be 5 Stars, if they would just make one change on the directions. You need to soak the beans overnight!I made this soup yesterday and after the suggested two hours of cooking, the lentils, peas and beans were still rock hard. After six hours of cooking they were finally soft enough to be edible (but we had to go to bed or else would have cooked it another hour).That being said, I doctored it up a bit with Italian Seasonings and replaced two of the cups of water with 2 cups of stewed tomatoes. And of course the six hours of simmering time blended the flavors wonderfully.I would buy it again, but take the peas, beans and lentils out to put in a pot of water overnigh to soak and soften."
2,Not for us,We gave this soup a try over the weekend. It smelled wonderful while cooking but the end result tasted very bland and didn't seem to be improved by adding additional seasonings. We had to throw it all out. In the end this product is not for us. If we try again with better results we will update.
3,This is my least favorite bk of the Rock Creek series.,"I loved the Reese and Nate books. Thought the Cash book was a super finale, bringing all the guys and their families together. Unfortunately I didn't like the Rico tale at all and Jed is a disappointment. Jed and Hannah are great fun. The dialogue is witty and they are people you want to see find happiness. The story line/plot is pretty weak. Having read the other stories which held one's interest and were really enjoyable this one was a disappointment.The series as a whole is a great concept but skipping this one won't impact the others."
5,Jed,Qreat story line and good carricture developement JED is a good read. not necessary to read all 6 books. But they are all good
4,They Do a Decent Job of Drilling,"These bits have been on my hammer drill more than a few times and both have punched smaller diameter holes though concrete, brick & granite with relative ease. The bits appear tough, they're still sharp. Out of the box they looked like quality percussion bits, with well machined flutes and clean, sharp carbide tips compared to a sloppy, $14.00 Vermont American set I own:http://www.amazon.com/Vermont-American-1402199-Double-Masonry/product-reviews/B003O9AAW2/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1This set comes with two 1/4"" bits as it's a very common sized fastener gauge. The larger bits have three flattened areas on the shank to insure a solid gripping surface to prevent slipping in the chuck on a bind. These bits are not just ""disposable bits"" like other, cheaper ones on the market."
5,Great Shirt,Bought this for my boyfriend before he was going to a Knicks game as a gift...he just loved it...great shirt..fast shipping!!
2,I was disappointed,"I initially was very excited to buy this thermal carafe model because I had gone through several coffeemakers with glass ones and the cost to replace the carafe is 75% of the cost of a new coffeemaker! But my excitement soon turned to disappointment. This unit is attractive, but not engineered well. The basket door is always going off its track and lopsided, and the carafe is just plain leaky. It leaked and now the clock LED doesn't work, and the design of the carafe is poor, so that it is next to impossible to empty it fully without turning it all the way.upside down. And the lid is just plain difficult to screw on straight. Additionally, when you pour the water into the reservoir, it is inevitable that it will spill and drip. It even has a poorly located vent at the middle top back that lets the water leak down the back as you fill the machine. I'm not going back for another!"
4,Good piece of gear,"Keeps the coffee hot for hours without that burnt taste you can get from traditional coffee warmers. I wish it held just a little more coffee, though."
1,Mystery leak in caraffe,"I rarely make/drink coffee, so it's not as if my pot is overused, yet there appears to be a leak inside my caraffe for this coffee maker, which causes coffee to build up inside the base of the pot and get moldy, and smell."
1,Piece of Junk,"If you push the button without water in it - you broke it. If you do not set the cover correctly and coffee spills over it - you broke it.Nice maker, but not mistake friendly."
2,try another brand,"I had wanted a thermal carafe to keep my coffee hot for my lunch time cup, however, the carafe keeps the coffee luke warm at best. Also it is very difficult to pour out the last cup and empty the carafe. Buy a regular drip coffeemaker and a separate thermal carafe and pour from one to the other, it's easier."
1,"Very poor product, Very poor customer service","I bought 4 of these makers and only have one working one left. The working one is the only one that lasted over 1 month. All the water heaters quit functioning in the others. After numerous email and phone tag with Mr Coffee, they said they were going to send me replacements and so far never have. This was all back in the summer of 2002. When this last one quits, So will my business with Mr. Coffee as I will never ever purchase their products again."
2,Thermal coffee maker,"The coffee never quite gets hot enough, and the capacity is too small; the 8 cups is really more like 6 cups. Not having a heating element is a plus, but that's the only thing going for this coffee maker."
1,Carafe broke,After only 3 months of use the carafe exploded at night when it was empty and sitting in the coffee maker which was off.
1,A Flawed Design,"... The design of this product is flawed. I've never been so dissatisfied with a simple kitchen appliance. Any coffee lover should beware - this is not the product for you.The carafe retains old, stale water and leaks constantly. I too had to replace my original carafe (although I bought one for $!). The lip of the carafe is not a good design for pouring without spilling coffee. All in all, this product ...!"
2,"Too Predictable, But Kept My Attention","My main problem with this book was that it was too simple-you knew what was going to happen from page one. Then, save for a few pages of not-so-distressing suspense, it did happen.The characters are interesting: the brilliant doctor Jacob Weber, a renowned fertility specialist with no people skills, who just happens to also be handsome, and have a soft spot, and sassy, smart, beautiful Ella Gardner, a divorced prosecutor who will not let anything come in the way of what she wants: a baby. Dr. Weber is so socially inept that everyone Ella knows can't stand him, but she sees a softer, different side of the man. Helping their relationship is a common goal: to help out an old professor they both knew while at Saunders University, though they did not know each other. It was predictable, but kept my attention; I finished it in one sitting."
4,Great Product!,"I just brought this item not to long ago along with my PLS Laser Equipment, guys it does makes the differnce specially at long distances and under bright sunlight. the alarm detector is loud enough you can hear at a distance. great product!Israel H. Montilla, Ph.D, CPMPROCON PROJECT MANANGEMENT & CONSTRUCTION CONSULTANTSSANTO DOMINGO,DOMINICAN REPUBLIC"
5,"Used copies of the book "" Second Hoeing""",I've been very pleased with all the used books I've purchased via Amazon and its subsidiaries. All the books I've received have been in great condition. This is a great service. I will use it again. Thank you.
3,Like a good lunch,"Perrotta proves again that his writing is likeable if not very impactful in this book of loosely connected stories about growing up in the 1970s. While I didn't enjoy Bad Haircut as much as Perrotta's later novels, I still devoured it more or less in one sitting and then tossed it aside. It was like a good lunch: I enjoyed the experience but wouldn't recall it much by the next day."
3,Zirko,"Bad Haircut is a collection of stories about the life of the main character, Buddy. It starts off when he was a lil kid, and carries the reader through his teenage years. Most stories are humorous and filled with real life characters. The story is set in the seventies; so you can imagine all the drug and sex action going on. Some stories are on the dry side, but overall the book is a good, easy read."
4,"Good, not great, Perrotta work.","I really enjoy Tom Perrotta as an author, having stumbled upon ""The Wishbones"" by accident and enjoying it so much that I read ""Joe College"" and ""Election"" in rapid progression thereafter. This novel, written as a series of short stories detailing different events as Buddy, the protagonist, grows up in Cranwood, NJ.The novel introduces us to an 8-year old Buddy as a Cub Scout and leaves us when Buddy comes home from college before he ends his teenage years. There are many funny moments throughout. For example, the ""weapon"" Buddy chooses to take to the race riot made me laugh aloud. There are also many poignant snapshots of disappointment and maturity, such as the one provided by the ""bad haircutter"".Despite all of this, I left the book feeling that I never really got to know Buddy that well. Sure, he seems like your average kid who has hopes and fears and experiences more than his share of peer pressure, but other than that, who is he?"
2,Bad Haircut review,"I'm not sure what's with all the 5-star reviews for Bad Haircut. I did find it mildly amusing. Nothing seemed too laugh out loud hilarious though. It's more of a chuckler, with some nice memories thrown in.After awhile though, all of the stories and themes started blending together a little too much. Too many stories seemed like stories I had read a few chapters ago.And lastly, the stories often end abruptly without any sort of ending. Period. End of story.Bad Haircut was a nice, quick easy read though, but after awhile, it lost my interest. Tom Perotta may be better as a novelist, but I don't think I'll read him again to find out."
4,Great book up until the flop ending,"I really enjoyed the short stories of adolescence that Tom Perrotta collected in this book. Even though I grew up more in the 80s than the 70s, it was close enough. Or maybe every child/teenager in a small town has similar experiences no matter what the era. At any rate, the stories were very well-written and made me remember what it really felt like growing up. Until the end, that is. I guess I expected the last story to leave me with an idea of what Buddy (the main character) learned from all this, and where he thought he was going. Instead (SPOILER ALERT!), I got something about him being a pall bearer for a guy he hardly knew and that guy's wife getting all choked up over a picture she once took of Buddy and her husband. Huh? Maybe I'm a little dense, but I just didn't get the significance."
1,"If you own other pattern books, pass this one up....","I'm a professional mehndi artist, and I own a good many of these patterns already. The book is just black and white patterns....and very minimal colour photos and such. Many of these patterns were taken from some original Indian books that I already own, by Navneet publishing. I recommend buying the Navneet books over this one. If you are a novice, pass it up too!"
2,Not Worth The Price- Don't waste your money!,"I brought this book and though it would be great based on the reviews of others.I was disappointed!It is true there are a lot of pictures however, some pictures are too small and you have to enlarge them to be able to see the detail clearly.Who has a photocopier in their house and is willing to waste money on copying the images in order to make them large enough to see, honestly?The other thing was all the pages have inked all over each other and smudged on top of each other so there are marks on every page which shouldn't be there.I agree the patterns are also stolen from Indian henna books and none of them are the author's original work!"
3,Doesn't work!!,"I took it out of the box and it was all in great shape. I tried to boot it up and the original hard drive said ""No operating system found"" So i took out that hard drive and put in another one. It just sat there displaying a white cursor at the top left hand corner of of the screen. So i put another hard drive in there did the same thing. I even re-installed Win XP one of my HDs and still nothing. So finally i put the original HD in and the Win XP HD in and it booted to the factory HD with IBM desktop and WinUser account. I left it on for about 1 hour and came back in and shut it down. I put 1GB of memory in it and it hasn't booted since. All it does is turn on, turn of for a second and turned back on but no display on the monitor and the keyboard doesn't work either. I then put the 512MB of memory back in... NOTHING! I have done everything that i can think of and it doesn't work. I even put another graphics card in to see if the machines VGA port was messed up and nothing works."
2,sex for those in real trouble !! very dull and basic,a diasppointing video showing the most basic techniques undertaken by not very convincing actors/actresses. not in the least bit arousing or erotic to watch
5,Nikon is Number 1,"I bought this auto level package for my boy friend. He is a carpenter and told me Nikon was the best. He got it and loves it.The tripod says Spectra but all tripods are made by the same company.We did some research and Nikon and Spectra do NOT make tripods.All we know if the tripod that comes with this pacakge is high quality like the Nikon level.Thanks Amazon for helping me make my ""beau"" happy."
4,great kicks,"I am a black belt instructor at Ohio University and found this tape to be very helpful. The tape is set up for you to follow along and he goes through each kick many times and from different angles. He even does it in slow motion. If you aren't willing to practice while the tape is playing, I recommend you don't purchase the tape. I tried just watching it, without practicing along, and found myself fast forwarding to the next section. Most of the kicks I already knew, but there were some variations of kicks that were new to me. I am excited to try them out next time I spar."
5,wonderful introduction to german literature,"I have a used copy of the second edition (see product image), and it has a very good selection of stories written by a diverse population of German authors. I like the question/answer section prior to each reading, and the practice of vocabulary and sentence building afterwards. It is good for intermediate level student. I looked up table of content from this edition, and it included several new authors including Heinrich Boll, Federica de Cesco, etc., a few of my favorite writers. The price for the book is fairly steep but if you can get a used copy for a reasonable price it's well worth the money."
3,Online reading,Probably just one of those books that is good for the novice but not really for someone into showing Shetland sheepdogs.
2,Informative and resourceful,The photographs brought out the beauty of the sheltie and the book helped me to better understand him. It's definately a plus for sheltie lovers and owners.
5,An amazing heart warming book,amazing lovely and fun loved the whole book. A real page turner I could never put it down. Its enjoyable!
4,"Perfect Before, During, After or On It&#65533;s Own","Perfect Before, During, After or On It's OwnOne thing about this book that sticks out for me is that it would make an awesome supplement to any of the books written about Muhammad Ali.This is a great book of photographs of Muhammad Ali (Neil Leifer photographer) accompanied by miscellaneous quotes and text by Thomas Hauser - who is one of the best authorities on Muhammad Ali.It's one of those books that can be read in one sitting and leaves you smiling.It's mentioned in the book that this picks up where Hauser's Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times leaves off, but I think you can read this before or after or even during - it definitely would add to the experience, but is not a requirement - Memories stands well on it's own and is very enjoyable.VERY hard to come by - you'll probably need to buy it used on Amazon or on eBay."
1,Useless,Not worth one star.This is undoubtedly the worst instruction manual I have ever seen. A book would be light years faster than this monster. If you enter a search word it takes absolutely forever searching through the disk.Then you find inane statements.I loaded the entire CD onto my hard disk and that is not much an improvement. Why it is even marketed?
3,Mastering Quickbooks 2003 Pro,For the price the product is pretty good. It teaches you the features of Quickbooks well. I purchased another CD ROM for $6 that covers very little. This is definitely superior. I'm sure you can spend about $100 for a better one.
4,Excellent for the price,"I just purchased these speakers last night and stayed up later than usual testing them out. I found that they are very easy to set up and you get a very nice full sound out of them. I'm not much of a audiofile so some of the finer points of speaker placement and stuff like that are beyond me. However for the price you really can't beat these speakers. My only complaint was that I noticed a slight ""popping"" or ""cracking"" noise. It wasn't something that happened all the time, but if the band on the CD I was testing it with would hit a certain note I could pick up that popping noise. I don't know if that has to do with my cheap sound card or if it's the speakers themselves. However, considering the price I paid for these I can live with it."
5,"Simply, These Speakers Rock","Hardware: Turtle Beach Santa CruzHad I known how much richer my mp3's would sound, I would have bought these speakers long ago. As I write this review, my roomates are sleeping (or trying to), and it's all I can do to not jack the volume up. But now, even at low volume, the music resonates. Such depth. I may never be able to use headphones again.If you've got a 5.1 sound card, you can't beat these, especially for the price. If you don't have a 5.1 card, make sure to get the an excellent Turtle Beach card.Initially, I had the same center speaker issue as noted in 2 reviews listed here. I had to select the 'Virtual 5.1' setting in my audio control panel and the center speaker worked just fine. [Plug the center speaker jack into the Turtle Beach 'Versa' plug.]I couldn't be happier with this sound."
2,Defective by design,"Make sure you're happy with the volume setting on the control, then never touch it again if possible. I've had issues with the volume fading to near silence if I have to turn down the volume with the hardware control. Tapping on the knob brings the volume back.After looking up solutions to this problem, it turns out that there is a floating ground issue with the volume control. This is a manufacturing flaw that has hit more than a few users.When they work, they're great. If you're struggling to get your sound back, not so much. If not for the volume issue, I'd keep 'em. Instead, I just bought a set of Logitech X-540 speakers."
3,Failed to impress me,"I have always preferred Creative speaker over Altec Lansing, my friend has a Creative Inspire 4400 paired up with Sound Blaster Live! So decided to buy a Audigy 2 ZS and Creative Inspire 5200.... Obviously I expected the sound to be better than my friends but I was shocked when I found out that the sound completely lacked depth. the speakers have a good clean bass, more than enough for me but whats the use if the sound has no depth!! I recommend the cheaper 4400 and if you have cash go for 5300 or better gd680."
3,great flying - rest is so-so,"The author writes some incredbile flying sequences. I am a commercial pilot and they are as good, and as accurate, as it gets. If it was all flying it would be 5 stars for sure. Now to the other parts. There are a HUGE amount of very detailed sexual encounters between 60+ year old American pilots and teenage Asian girls. If that turns you on, then you will love this book. I could do without the ""Dear Forum"" level of detail. I have never been to SE Asia, but evidently you can't walk 3 feet without some young girl grabbing you.There are also some gaping plot holes. I don't want to spoil it, but usually the evil drug lords kill the pilots AFTER they smuggle the drugs!"
4,aspara jet,"And exciting book to read. The author knows what he writes aboutbecause he is and airline pilot. Some hot sex also, over all a good read."
5,good,i am very pleased with ths model i belive this product hellps build a kids areas in building skills which mind you can help them in the long run.it is very durable though the hands like to fall off when your trying to place wepons an such.over all it is a very fun toy to build.
3,Whoa! I wasn't expecting all the cocaine use,"Hey, parents, take note: the mystery is drug trafficking... and girls.I only know James Howe from the truly excellent Bunnicula books, so I didn't hesitate to pick this library book up for my son. Like all Howe's books, this one features believable characters and an excellent writing style that doesn't condescendd to kids.However, the subject matter isn't right for us. Small-town cocaine dealers aren't what I want my pre-teen reading about. Stick to The Brixton Brothers, eh?"
5,A Great Book!,"This book is about a woman, Ruth, who is dying to pursue her dream of leaving her small town. But she is bound by a radiostation that is about to go under. She is also confronted by her past in the form of her ex-boyfriend, Paul.The book was a very well-written and enjoyable book. I really liked the ""be content wherever you are"" theme. I think thatwe can all learn something from that verse in the Bible. The book also did a great job with the development of thecharacters, and explaining the past history with Ruth and Paul.And the stress that Ruthie felt in keeping her radio station afloat came out so good.This is the first book by Henke that I have read. I look forward to reading more of her books."
4,Quick read...great for kids!!!,"A simple search of the Internet provided limited at best information on Saint Patrick. A friend lent our family a simple children's book on this man's life. Obviously written for the younger reader, my 6 year old son enjoyed the book as much as my wife and I did.The author does a good job of outlining Patrick's life and the victories work through him. One can not help but gain a respect for the man in reading this book. The book certainly inspires the reader to expand their knowledge of this man whose holiday brings much festivity every year. Also helpful at the end of each chapter are a series of questions and new vocab to help aid further discussion and comprehension with your children. I enjoyed this book and recommend it for a quick read as well as helpful instruction for your children."
2,Not what I was expecting,I bought two of these necklaces for my bridesmaids. The chain on this necklace is a very poor quality. It is very flimsy and looks like it will easily break. The pendant was also much smaller than I expected it to be. I was able to find a better quality necklace locally for a lower price and ended up returning them.
3,Not the greatest,I didn't think this was the greatest game. It seemed too unrealistic. I don't think it's worth it.
1,A book written to appease the author's ego,"Not in all my life have I had so much trouble getting through a book. A mere 226 pages, it took me over a week to read. Kraut's seems to feel the need to use words many well educated people have never seen in their lives just for the sake of using big words. Whenever he speaks of his other books, he refers to himself in the third person and quotes himself rather than just stating the facts. An uninteresting and egotistical story of immigrantion."
4,repeat purchase,"My wife just bought this for the second time. The straps on the first one fell apart after less than 2 years of hard (she loaded it very heavy and used it every day) use. I tried to get her to get something different that might last longer, but after extensive online searching she went ahead and bought it again because she really liked (looks, comfort, function) the first one until it fell apart."
5,Great,"This book has been very helpful. It is easy to read, it is easy to look things up in and provides a nice section on treatments of different disorders as well as describing the disorder."
4,Superb!,"An excellent overview of orthopaedics, with good sections on numerous conditions and injuries. Easy to use reference with attractive layout and introductory illustrations. I took off one point because the diagnostic images (x-ray, MRI, CT, etc) could be improved."
2,not the same Doro!,"For fans of the old Doro Pesch from back in the 80's and early 90's, this is a great disapointment. Amidts claims that she still sounds like she used to, from her Warlock days, I have to disagree sharply, he rsound is neither the same nor even remotely in the same genre and direction.The Earth shattering screams and magnificient vocals my erstwhile favorite female metal singer was known for back in the days are nowhere to be found anymore and I was badly disapointed at this commercial, watered down effort by Doro and had to sell the album after a few months."
3,Good enough!,"Some people were complaining that the cartridges were not Leland brand, but some generic kind that had been placed in the box and the box scotch-taped shut. I noticed this too. I wish the company would be a little more up-front about that, which is why I gave it a 3.But they work just the same. C02 is C02 (as long as it's food-grade)"
2,Didnt work so well for an Isi Soda Water maker,"I recently purchased 2 boxes of these cartridges. By far, they were the cheapest around. Unfortunately, for my Isi Soda Fountain these cartridges dont work so well. They dont make the water as bubbly as other company products."
2,Leland soda charger,I ordered them 3 days ago and try arrived right on time but as I write this review I am using my isi... Finally. I2 of the soda charger wouldn't puncture and when they did nothing went into my drink it was a big waste. So no I'm down to 8 an it hasn't even been 10 minutes since I got it. I finally got one to puncture and work but am I satistified not at all.
5,Love it!,Who doesn't love a quiet man. Sullivan was a fabulous choice for the second book. His and Eden's story was so romantic.
4,Another really great book in this series...,I really enjoyed this book. At the beginning of this book you are introuduced to Eden who is traveling to Rock Creek with 2 stray children that she has taken in as her own. Along the way she runs into Sullivan who escorts her the rest of the way to Rock Creek. Sullivan soon realizes that the lady he is traveling with is Jed's little sister. He tells himself to stay away but soon finds out that it's near impossible. When Eden & Sullivan arrive in Rock Creek Jed is out of town so it gives them more time to build a romance. Sullivan soon has druken Nate marry him & Eden so they can go further in their relationship. Shortly after that Jed returns & calls the marriage null & void. It's a fun book. Be sure to read Rock Creek: Reese by Lori Handeland first. I was little disappointed that you didn't really see much of Reese in this book but other then that the book was pretty good. Recommended.
4,"Works well, too expensive IMO","This bracket works well. I have the PLS 180 and it came with this bracket but has since been misplaced. I was shocked to see the price for a replacement but have since given up looking for it and ordered one. Strong magnets, machined aluminum, knurled knob has an e-clip to hold it in place (unlike other brands). Works well with aFastCap 3rd Hand Support System 57-to-144-Inches, 2-pack #3HAND5. I cut off the foam hand grips to allow the bracket to slide up and down. I use it for tile courses in bath remodels as well as header heights, neck moldings on columns, how crooked old houses are..."
5,Great Music!,"The CD is fun to listen to and a great choice! Nami Tamaki has a clear voice, and the songs are all very good."
5,This cd is really great!,"Im so happy i stumbled across this cd on amazon! It really deserves 5 stars no doubt about it. She has a really sweet voice, and each song has its own really addicitive beat! Stop reading and buy the cd , you'll have a hard time getting it out of your cd player , trust me !"
5,Wow!,"I first heard of Nami Tamaki when i saw her music video ""Prayer"" on the azn channel...shes so amazing! I like the fact that she was a dancer before she became a singer, so she choriographs(sp?) all her music video's herself! Besides that her voice is amazing! I personally think Prayer is the best song on the album but many people vary..."
5,Great Game!,This is a great game. Very fun and enjoyable to play. Encourages learning too. I'd suggest buying it and have fun playing.
1,DON'T DO IT! This game is WORSE than any lawyer joke!,"I bought the game after reading the back of it at FAO, and was VERY under impressed. There is NO skill involved...you might as well be playing candy land (with some court speak that you can pick up from Boston Legal). You roll a dice and move and get penalized/rewarded based on where you land and the luck of the card you draw. The person who wrote the back of the box deserves an award, but this game does not!"
1,Broke in Less than a Year,"Don't waste your money on this product. Shortly after purchasing (but after the return-time-frame) this product started making loud noises, vibrated the object it was on and within less than a year, broke. Try another company and avoid SmartDisk. I'd like to return it but how can I salvage any of the private files that might be able to be accessed (by those who know how to do it)?? I can't so I feel I can't return it without risking that. Use another company. I hear Western Digital makes a very good product."
1,Not Compatable,"I purchased this keyboard because of the features. I mainly liked the fact that it has mouse functions built in. Convenient yes? Not quite. The software for the keyboard isn't compatable to my computer for some reason. I had to call the help line for my computer, and the tech I spoke to couldn't figure it out. Beside the fact that this keyboard didn't work; my computer wouldn't boot-up. No matter what I tried, it wouldn't work. My computer tech finally figured out what I had to do to get back into my computer and determined that either there was something wrong with the keyboard, the software or both. I had to send it back. No more of this brand of keyboard for me."
5,Bye bye seasonal allergies,"I bought this air purifier to combat my seasonal allergies. I have this running on medium in my 10 x 15 bedroom constantly and even with the window open I wake up without a headache. I had an ""ionic"" type purifier before this and the only positive about it was that you didn't need to replace a filter. I switched to this purifier and immediately noticed a difference. I can also tell it's working when I check the filter a week after I replace it and it's already full of dust!I do recommend buying the real 3M filtrete filters, I tried the knock off brand and they didn't collect dust very well. Also the power consumption varies on what setting is used, it's less than the typical light bulb. Low = ~11 watts Medium = ~19 High = ~27."
5,Very simple but effective design,"This thing simply pulls air through a pleated and dense filter, but it is the most effective air cleaner I have ever used."
4,Air purifier,It seem to work well. I am not able to tell if the air quality has improved a lot. My wife's allergy seems to be better.
4,Very Good - Could be smaller,"Works well in my 13x19 room.Keep it on high with door closed when not in the room, lower it to low when in the room, especially when watching TV.Low speed is very quiet, medium may cause you to raise the TV vol slightly and high is a little noisy, but moves a lot of air.This is a big unit (Tall).I wish the filters had carbon on one side. They seem to work well to capture particulate matter like dust and pet hair, but I think the addition of carbon to one side of the filter would do more for odors.This does reduce odors as it, but not as efectivly as if it had carbon as well.Overall I'd buy it again. Filters need to be changed more often than reccommended, but I guess that means they are working.Filter prices could always be cheaper, especially when changing often, but they are cheaper than a lot of other brands.For the price - I am happy with this unit. You definitely could get better units, but you'd probably be spending a lot more."
5,Works very well,"Noticeable decrease in allergy symptoms. Never tried any other purifiers, though considering getting another one of these for the rest of the house."
5,Love It!,"I got one of these for my son's bedroom. He has asthma and allergies to dust so controlling the dust is key for his healthy. This unit absolutely is removing dust from the air - I can see it on the filter. Plus his symptoms have been reduced!It's almost soundless on the low setting which is what we used in his old, tiny bedroom. We moved him into a larger room and now have it on medium and it's still pretty quiet.I have no complaints!"
5,3 M air purifier and filtrete filters,"I 've had the 3 M Air purifier for a year nowI live in a retirement home . I have 2 12x20 rooms, the air purifiertakes care of my needs. It runs very quietly.I get my Filtrete filters through Amazon.Delivery is very good.The filters are a little pricy but Amazon notifies me when they are on sale.It all seems to work out for me anyway."
1,Not again!,"I'm extremely disappointed because Wood Harris and Elise Neal are two of my favorite actors. This was easily the worst performances of either of their careers, and a horrible movie to boot. The story reminded me of one of those ""smut book"" by one of the many ""fly by night"" so called authors that seem to be popping up all over Baltimore. The acting was terrible, the story was terrible, cinematography terrible, soundtrack terrible, camera work terrible in fact the only thing that was good about the movie was Gina's beautiful eyes and smile when she opened the door for Dayvon."
5,Very sensual scent,"I followed a women in the grocery store after watching 3 men totally turn around when she walked by. When she walked by me, I could see why. She smelled wonderful. Not overdone but light and extremely sensual...so much so that it turned heads. I followed her and asked what she was wearing and this was it. I ordered some right away. I am NOT disappointed. It smelled the same on me and definately made my husband take notice! This could be worn as an everyday fragrance but take warning if you do. You will be followed everywhere."
5,Scrumptious,"I love this perfume. It's classy and not overwhelming, but it hangs around all day long. This is a very high quality scent and doesn't make your nose want to run screaming into the night. People often compliment this perfume when I wear it. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a sophisticated but sensual scent."
1,FAKE,"ONCE MY WIFE OPENED THIS NEW BOTTLE AND USED IT SHE IMMEDIATELY STATED WHEN I SPRAYED MY NEW PERFUME IT BURNED. I COMPARED THE BOTTLES NEW ANS OLD, THE REAL BOTTLE HAD A NOTICEABLE COLOR DIFFERENCE IN THE LID AND THE ACTUAL SPRAYER WAS MUCH LARGE THAN THE REAL AND WHITE IN COLOR. NEXT TIME I WILL GO TO MY LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE. THANKS FOR NOTHING."
5,Great fragrance!,This one smell very good and Amazon price is great! Don't try to buy in some online store to pay a little less because you can get a fake perfume! Beware of some online store like ISFRAGRANCE is TERRIBLE!!! Pay a little more and get a nice perfume real one! ISFRAGRANCE sells FAKE!!!!!!! Buy here at Amazon.
4,D & G,"I used this a few years back, so I can't exactly say what it used to smell like, all I can say is I only have pleasant memories of the fragrance. I remember it as a classy, slightly powdery nice smell. I hardly see it anywhere else though. I can tell you that I haven't seen it anywhere in the last 5 years, so it's good amazon carries it, assuming it's the original."
4,BUT monkey!,An excellent book which includes factual unbiased ways by which to motivate adults to learn! Definately required reading material to be a more affective instructor! BUT the author digresses at the end of the last chapter into spouting his opinions about how the motivation should be used to institute social change and environmental policy.Great book but can we keep our opinions off topic to ourselves?!?
4,adult motivation,"An ""OK"" book. I purchased it for a diverse adult class room setting. Not a lot of helpful info for understanding intrinsic or extrinsic motivation across cultures."
3,As good as textbooks get,"Reading this for an independent study for a Masters program. It's somewhat dense reading, but the information is very valuable."
4,"Excellent, but slightly overpriced","I picked these up to use with my Sony HD5 Network Walkman. For comparison, I used the stock earbuds that came with the player and a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ps.For earbuds, these are really the best i've ever heard. The highs and mids are rich and seperated, almost as good as the Etymotics. The bass is lacking, but this is to be expected with earbuds. The bass is great compared to pretty much all of the other earbuds I have ever used, but definately not up to Etymotic standards. I don't like the isolation of in-ear canal headphones, so this is a tradeoff I can live with.If you are looking for a bass boost, get a pair of hearbuds (search for HBUD1 onm Amazon.) They make these things POUND with bass, but they do dull out the mids and highs a bit. You can compensate for most of this with an equalizer.Also, the cord comes in two parts for those of you who are using remotes for your mp3 players (very convienent)."
5,Shamanism In Europe,"Yes, Ginzburg actually contends that the so-called ""witches"" of old Europe were in fact remanents of the old Shamanic cultures of Europe, and he does make an excellent arguement for it. I will admit, I do agree with him on some points. Shamanism is a universal phenomena, and yet (with the notable exception of the Lapps in Scandinavia and a few scattered myths and legends like Orpheus and Odin) Shamanism seems to have all but been absent in Europe, and this has always puzzled me. Certainly, had Shamanism been widespread in Europe, it probably would have survived well into the Christian era, just as it has in other parts of the world. As such, Ginzburg may be right on the money about the witch hunts and such. Regardless of your thoughts on the subject, this remains an excellent book. And if you like it, he has another book, entitled ""Night Battles"" about a community of Shaman in northern Italy."
3,A Good Start Says It All.,"John Emshwiller's book Scam Dogs and Mo Mo Mamas is fine effort to introduce the reader to the little known world of internet pumping and dumping, and insider stock manipulation using cyber space as a tool to get it done. But with this book that's as far as it goes. Mr. Emshwiller missed a key part of the story when it comes to the myth that has been built around alleged cyber snoop, and consumer advocate Janice Shell. Mr. Emshwiller never does seem to get the story right about the ""Two Ricks,"" and who Janice Shell and Rick Marchese really are. He seems to take Ms. Shell's word for who she really is, and does little or no real research into the allegations Ms. Shell is really Janice Evans living in Milan, Italy under the alias of Janice Shell without the knowledge of the Italian Government. There is much more to be found on the subject of Janice Shell and her friends, and the reader is encouraged to use this book as only starting point."
2,Not much to recommend it.,"Kind of loopy- much of it is copies of the dopey email between the parties. And to call them dopey is to be kind. Lots of blah blab blah and not much nitty-gritty; little or no insights into net trading. One of those ""empty calories books"" that leave you hungry after you've finished it."
2,Deceptive Work,"Although this work was officially written by Lance Banning, there is no mistake that it is an outgrowth of the theories of J.G.A. Pocock. Essentially, Banning tries to make the case that the Jeffersonian Republicans were the American version of Bolingbroke's ""Country Party."" Moreover, he tries to demonstrate how the party advocated the classical republican values of ""civic humanism."" Ultimately, the book falls flat on its face. Anyone acquanted with Jefferson, as well as his party, should be able to see right through Banning's account. Although there certainly were classical republican elements in their thought, these were only secondary and complimentary to the libertarian theories of natural rights and individualism. A more accurate (although still deeply flawed) account is Joyce Appleby's work ""Capitalism and a New Social Order:The Republican Vision of the 1790's."""
4,Good Fit,"I've already gone through two other camera bags looking for the right fit for my Canon Rebel SLR with telephoto lens. This bag fits just right. And, the bright blue color makes it easy to spot and easy to remember."
2,Far From Adequate,"After all these years Tamrac still can't get it right.I shoot constantly for my Driving & Discovering Hawaii guidebooks. This is a holster, worn around the waist, so the hinge should open on the opposite side, and the top should open completely, AWAY from the user, and stay put, out of the way, so I can retrieve my camera without it getting caught up on the lid and my dropping it. Common sense: the holster is supposed to be about quick, easy access. Do these Tamrac people actually use their own products in the field? Apparently not.This thing also needs more pouches/pockets. My older Tamrac holster has a zipper on top of the lid for stashing stuff---batteries, charger, tapes, whatever---as well as another inside the lid. Additional pouches needn't be large: we just need to organize our stuff efficiently so we can find it fast, rather than have it all jumbled together in one place."
2,Inconsistent Screen Issues,"No matter what the outside condition of this monitor...production date as indicated on rearof unit was JULY 2003. This fact was never indicated in the description data! Had I beenaware of inconsistent screen issues (contrast varies from dark in center to light atthe outer edges), I would have NEVER made this purchase!"
3,"Some wisdom, a lot of repetition","Bly does offer a great deal of writing wisdom in this popular book. Make wise use of your time. Set up your office efficiently. Sell and resell your articles. Put time into those projects that will bring you the most return. Etc. For the most part it's common sense, sprinkled with a lot of examples and quotes from writers.Don't get me wrong, it's a helpful book. However, it suffers from major repetition. Bly tends to say the same thing over and over, just in different ways.Beginning writers may find the query samples and other practical information helpful.I don't think this book is worth nearly all the adulation that has been heaped upon it."
4,Loaded with ideas to improve your writing income,What I really enjoyed about this book is how Bob shares his passion for writing AND making a good living at it. It's all here: How to write more - how to sell more.
3,"solid product, terribly hard to remove sticker","Just like one of the previous reviewers, I'm happy with the quality of this grill basket -- it's solid and wonderful on the grill. BUT! It took us 45 minutes of scrubbing at the big sticker they put over the grill pan--with fingernails, hot water, and then Googone--to finally remove the sticker and get ready to grill. If you want something you can use the same day you get it after work, I'd recommend another product. If you've got time and energy to remove the label, go for this one."
3,Seemingly good product but poor packaging,"So far the grill basket seem to be well made of good quality stainless. However, I was very frustrated when I received my order than the company had slapped a big label over the entire center of the pan that would not come off cleanly. After 45 minutes of pealing and scrubbing I still have not been able to get off all the sticky stuff from the label to use my grill basket. Needless to say, very frustrating when a simple, small, removable label would have done just fine."
5,Changed the way we eat!,"Yes, the label was a pain to get off. And the first time I used it I never thought I would get all the food that baked onto it cleaned off. BUT, the next time I used a little ""Olive Oil Pam"" and no sticking at all.Slice some yellow squash or zucchini (or both), a med. onion, a little red bell pepper, toss with olive oil, salt & pepper (or Mrs. Dash etc.), set it on the grill and MAGIC! This little gadget has changed the way we grill. What we grill."
2,Good product but the label is extremely difficult to remove.,"The label is extremely difficult to remove. I used nails, glue-gone on both sides, and a heavy duty brush to scrape it off. I took me more than an hour for glue to be resolved before I was able to use the basket. During the waiting time I grilled the veggies on the plain grill. I kindly suggest to the manufacturer to stop using crazy-glue or whatever material they are using to stick the label at the moment."
3,"A good ""coffee"" book!","Sheryl Dayton is a PR Exec, a difficult job of late since someone has filed a lawsuit against her company. Nathan Hall is a reporter, who believes Sheryl's boss is guilty of stealing someone's idea for a computer game. Being on opposite sides, the action heats up as Sheryl defends her company and Nathan's determined to get to the truth! And of course neither of them can stop thinking about each other. . .I thought this was a good read. I liked the characters & the story moved along. Would've liked to have seen poor Brad get a girlfriend though...or at least wrap up his therapy appointments."
1,Gives battery problems/poor coverage,"This phone worked great for first 8 months but now I am unable to charge the battery. I got a new charger also, but that did not help. I read similar problems with Motorola phones on internet.Secondly, the voice reception is not so good. When I took to this to Cingular, they asked me to get a Nokia because that has a very good reception.So in a nutshell, I was bowled over by its looks when I bought it but next phone will definitely be Nokia."
4,IT'S OKAY,"I'd guess this vest just doesn't turn me on that much --- I know it's utilitarian but I however just don't like the styling all that much and the counts for me. However, I'm quite sure it will get good use on my photo outings and it IS A KEEPER!!!"
4,Photopher's Vest,"Tamrac 153 World Correspondent Vest Large KhakiThis is the second vest of this kind I have purchased and a third was given as a gift. They are light weight and durable with sufficiently numerous and large pockets to carry an assortment of photographic gear. Over time the black vest has lost some of its color. They are not intended to replace a carrying or storage bag for photography equipment, but they do provide space for most of the equipment needed for a photo shoot for a day. I wouldn't hesitate buying another for myself if needed or a gift. I regret paying for 1 day shipping, since it took longer for the vests to arrive."
3,"Great Pictures, too opinionated.","The collection of old photos is wonderful and worth buying the book just for them. However I expected more historical information, and I was put off by the authors need to insert his personal opinion about the original design of the ships that was contrary to the original designers. It was clear he did not understand the motivation of the period designers. I also had no interest in the author's personal history."
3,Enough,"This is good and suitable for all foods. It adds great tastes! At first I replace my regular table salt with `Alderwood smoked sea salt' thinking to have more nutritious value. Unfortunately, it suits only with sea foods rather I want a sea salt which suits for all kind of foods. Then I get my solution in `Sayulita Sea Salt'Sayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSalt. I am highly satisfied with its quality and taste."
4,Smoked sea salt,"The product was as advertised. A little coarser than I expected, but good non the less. The company shipped it quickly."
5,Jam-packed with Texas info,"A perfect resource for anyone needing statistics about the various counties and cities in Texas. Detailed info about political history, natural resources, population, all kinds of weather history and much more. Actually fun to look through and learn interesting facts as well as Texas trivia. A must for real Texans and a great help for newcomers and wannabes."
1,Obsolete technology and inferior material,"Don't waste your money on these fixtures, particularly on the aluminum versions if you live near saltwater. Instead, buy one of the brass LED versions of this fixture, e.g., 15764BBR. The brass LED fixtures are not that much more expensive and will quickly pay for themselves in maintenance savings. Note that if you have an electronic transformer, you may need to upgrade it to a transformer compatible with LED fixtures."
4,Good scent if you like perfume type smells,"It smells like perfume almost, but it does smell good. I filled my lamp half full and moved it from room to room every ten minutes or so. My whole house still smelled like it the next day even though I have 3 inside dogs! I totally recommend this scent for absorbing pet odors."
3,"Smells ok, but not as good as others",This is an OK smelling Lampe Berger fragrance. There are better smelling fragrances available so I would recommend trying others first.
4,"Not bad, but not spectacular either","The book did have some great tips and ideas, but it was also a bit too wordy and was aimed at a non-technical audience. If you are going to write an ezine, you should know the basics of e-mail and at least how to create a simple web page. But I can only imagine it was a very difficult task trying to write a book that everyone can benefit from, regardless of their level of geektitude.But overall I found the book to be very good, and I definetely like Chris's style. Chris did a nice job. I am definetely torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I have to go with four due to the fact that Chris obviously spent a great deal of time and really did try to have something for everyone in the book. I *DID* learn a lot from it, too, and I think that a lot of his advice was down to earth and practical. Definetely buy it, but remember it isn't a technical end all. I don't think you will be disappointed. Good Job Chris."
1,Don't throw away your money,"This is truly a terrible book - very thin on usable content. Further, the author, Chris Pirillo, writes like a high school ""valley girl."" It is a prime example that the Internet allows anyone - despite how dumb they are - to venture, and in this case, publish their opinions. Don't waste you money. And for the author, become a cheerleader!"
2,Poor Rehash of Poor Richard Trash,This book was a poor excuse for a definitive guide. Poor Richard rehashes are...well....<yawn>...kind of like Sam's Publishing IT books being definitive guides on how to fix a network in 10 days.
5,Very good price and right on time,Very good price and right on time. The book came brand new in its original package. Thanks
1,Not worth the money,"These speakers are cheap and you get the sound you expect from the price -- which is to say, not much."
1,how to calculate things you are not interested in,This book is a work of academic excellence. The authors have solved a calculation problem that no one else could do. The practical problem with the book is that it shows how to do precise calculations of electronic circuit parameters that are rarely needed and can be done with a circuit simulator in less time. One example is the precise value of out of band gain and impedance of an amplifier.
2,Not what the title implies,"The beginning of this book has an intro to some common Photoshop commands used throughout the book. Fine, but no magic. The next 1/3 of the book's examples are on animated gifs and special effects using the DEMO software on the CD! Still no photoshop ""magic."" The last parts of the book actually leave off using the DEMO software on the CD, but a few pop in there here and there. There were probably 5 official Photoshop effects in here that I liked. Really not worth the full price I paid at the book store, and since I didn't crack open the CD since I read that it was Demo software and really wasn't interested in annoying animated gif's, I'm probablybringing it back. BTW, the author works for a software comapany and he was just using this book to push his own stuff. He calls it ""magic"" I call it dishonest."
1,Magic Leaves You Frustrated,"""Photoshop 5 Web Magic"" is definitely not for the beginner. I bought this book, worked through many of the tutorials and found dead end explanations half way through the example. I returned this book and bought ""Adobe: Classroom in a Book"". Maybe I got ahead of myself by starting off with this book, that is my fault. But who's fault is it when the written examples are not complete?"
5,Victory is mine!,"My mother, a serious gardener, has had this book for as long as I can remember. This was one of the many cookbooks on our kitchen bookshelf. It wasn't until a few years ago, when I realized how much I really loved to cook, that she suggested I give it a look.I was desperate for a cake recipe for a family gathering and came upon the Carrot Cake recipe. Labor intensive, but ultimately, the BEST carrot cake I've ever had (if I do say so myself.) Family and friends loved it and it's now my go-to cake recipe.A treasure of a cookbook."
5,The Only Vegetable Cookbook You'll Ever Need,"That is, unless you have a taste for some really exotic vegetables. This book thoroughly covers most of the vegetables grown in the American garden. (I'd never heard of some of the entries) Not only does it give tasty recipes, it lists the growing seasons, gardening tips, and ways to preserve the vegetables that cannot be cooked right away. This is my favorite feature - especially since my father (avid gardener) will show up with two bushels of snap beans, eight heads of cabbage, etc. and I am panicking about how to use them before they spoil. If you are a gardener or the friend of a gardener, this book is indispensable."
3,Quality book needs updating,"I got this cookbook because of the rave reviews it received.Visually the cookbook looks completely out of date. The photos look like they were taken from a potluck in the '70s. Apparently this cookbook has cult status, from all the 5-star reviews, but I think it would benefit from being republished with new photos, modern formatting, and some updated recipes.This cookbook has older-style recipes in it. For example, the meatballs in gravy over egg noodles. I remember eating that on an airplane 30 years ago. Many of the recipes and photos have you reliving the culinary days of yore.Note to publisher: Update the cookbook and get a foothold with the younger victory garden cooks! The book has a great base, it just needs a modern makeover.You may want to look at, ""Farmer John's Cookbook: The Real Dirt on Vegetables"" an up-to-date farmer's market cookbook."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This book is amazing - I was looking for something to help me figure out what to do with my surplus of vegetables and this was recommended to me. I LOVE it. The pictures are fantastic, the recipes are delicious, and I love how it's sorted by vegetable. I made the chicken fricassee recipe (without the cream - used extra stock instead) and it was drool-worthy. But all the recipes I have tried are quite good. I look forward to trying them all!"
5,A MUSICAL TRIP AROUND TEXAS,THIS GUY CAN JAM? THAT MAYBE THE UNDER STATMENT OF THE MILLIENIEM. THE GUY IS GREAT. I FIRST DANCED TO GP IN 1965. GOSH I WAS DANCEING WHEN I WAS 2 YEARS OLD!
2,not effective,There doesn't seem to be enough of the polishing element in the cloth. It takes a very long time of polishing to take any of the tarnish off.
5,A little gem that does the job,"At 79 pages this little one did more for me than few other heavier offerings with CD ROMs included. In my French studies I got to the level of being able to read an article in, say, Le Monde , but not being able to pronounce any of the words I just read.You can of course try memorizing the spelling of the words as well but this would not get you too far - you get overwhelmed.So what I was looking for was a book that would explain me how, knowing some rules, to pronounce a French word that I've never seen before. And this book does that excellently .To learn to understand the spoken French you will need audio supplemented material though."
5,Good one-stop source for French phonetics.,"Look no further. You might need to consult something additional online, but overall this is a very good manual. Highly recommend."
5,a must for those serious about learning French,"This book is well organized, clearly written, packed with useful information and examples to untangle the mysteries of the french language. A very necessary reference book for serious students."
4,Like looking into the fun-house mirror,"I almost didn't buy this book because of the title. I'm not too fond of parodies. I actually own the other ""serious"" version of this book & found it much harder to read than this humorous but no less true version. I'd love to see these SuC in person :)This book helped me keep my kewl during the end of a nasty relationship, helped me laugh when I was tired of crying, and helped me see my part in a humorous, easy-to-swallow format. My relationship is still ending, but now I feel much better about it, having regianed my ability to laugh at humanity thanks to this book. I highly recommend it as a gift to newlyweds, singles & long-marrieds alike--in essence, to anyone who has ever been in a relationship with the opposite sex!"
3,Sir Dyno- AKA David Rocha,"I watched most the Quiroz brothers films. I would have to agree that the films are all very low budgetand C-D average acting. However, I believe that Sir Dyno is a good actor. His films should be seen as an outline. I liked the plot for Blood and Tears. With some improvements that plot could work. Even the plot in Dopegame 2 could work, if you filmed with the Oakland police, and border patrol. I think this if you applied some of these plots to modern day events, especially in California, gave the story at least a couple million budget, they could be great films."
5,HIGHLY EFFECTIVE,"Described as ""a thought modification program with supportive verbal coaching,"" this is one of Dr. Eldon Taylor's most popular and effective tapes for transforming your life. I have thorough experience with this title in its ""Echo-Tech"" technology version, which requires the use of headphones. There is an audible voice with echo effect and music over the soundtrack of inaudible subliminals. What's so great about this one is that it covers most important areas of your life with affirmations like ""I am pwerful/energetic/creative/honest/truthful/forgiven/stress free/healthier"" etc. whilst the audible voice is warm, reassuring and authoritative, even poetic at times. It is certainly a pleasure to listen to regularly and lives up to its promise of stimulating the desired improvements in your life after repeated listening."
3,Fine and not so fine tales... but still a good read,"Well, most people out there already put it down about this book contents.I would say that you'll find some fine work in the book, and I'm certainly refering to ""The Seven Geases"" by Clark Ashton Smith. IMO the very best tale in the book and just for this story, I would have buy the book. It's a pure gem!After that we have good reads for most of the book and some few poor stories. Sorry R.E.Howard fans, but his 2 tales are just plainly boring... So if you can make it out past the first 2 stories, you'll end up liking this anthology."
3,"hmmm, not their best work..","the story's are very bland, and theres really no plot development in most of them, neither do you care for the characters, its like reading a good story rewritten by a 10 year old, at first they seem to be headed in the right direction, but as you get to the exciting part they get lazy and just end the story either really fast or in a very unsuspected and dull way. If youre really interested in good Lovecraftian like stories go for some C.A.Smith, or George R.R. Martin. or something else not this."
4,Canon CB-5L Battery Charger,"It was unclear at first how to slip the battery in to the charger, however, once I did it charged the battery very well."
5,CANON DIGITAL CAMERA BATTERY CHARGER,I PURCHSED THIS AS A USED ITEM. IT WAS DELIVERED PROMPTLY AND WORKS GREAT! I RECOMMEND BOTH AMAZON AND TECH DEAL!
4,Canon CB-5L Charger,"This charger does exactly what is supposed to, very quickly. There is a cordless model that is a bit more compact."
4,More than I need.,"I bought this battery charger in addition to an extra battery for my Canon G3 Digital Camera. The reason being that Canon was really short-sighted in not shipping the camera with at least an external charger. With the price I paid, they could have at least done that!It's a really good camera with 1 or 2 quirks that you get used to. Excellent quality photos.But you can't use the camera while it is charging the battery.After 2 years I finally gave in and bought this charger. Someone must have been suffering from a guilty conscience at Canon, cause it came with 5 different power cables, so I can plug into almost any power outlet in the World.Just be careful to note the difference between the cables for the USA and Japan, because they are almost identical."
3,Just a charger,"I bought the Canon CB-5L after the cheap knockoff I got on ebay died a week after I got it. There's not much to say about the CB-5L. I started by putting a totally discharged Canon BP511 battery (with no so-called ""memory"" build-up) in it. A ""red"" indicator light came on which immediately turned steadily green. I removed and reseated the battery several times. Was the battery fully charged? Who knows! I left the battery to charge several hours just in case. Does the charger do its job? Well, yes. My problem is with the charge level indicator. There are three valued printed on the charger housing: 0, 50, 100. The indicator is supposed to be a nlinking light indicator that functions as time indicator of how much charging time is left. Doesn't work for me. Maybe my charger is defective.The charging unit feels light and flimsy. Not comfortable calling it ""high quality"". That's my 2 cents on it."
3,Check what you get,"I bought this as my son was travelling out of country and the reviews indicated that charger came with cables for all countries. Not the case! Only came with a cord for the US. Looking back at the product description, there is no indication of what cables come with the charger. If it used to come with many cables, Canon no longer includes them. On contacting Canon, they told me I could buy the other cables at an electronics store. Not what I expected. Worked fine for US, but didn't fit what I expected."
2,Easy reader watch,"This watch is easy to read, but very large. The face is much bigger than the size of a normal watch. My husband did not like it."
1,poor quality,"This looked like a great watch, big numerals easy to read, but I dropped it once as I was strapping it to my wrist and it broke open."
3,"works fine, but...","It works fine, but it looks REALLY cheap. Somehow the photo looks really nice, but once you put it in your arm, it looks lame! Stay away from this cheap watch... spend a few more bucks and get a Victorinox."
4,So far I love it,It's like wearing a number 16 train watch on your wrist but I love it. The watch is fairly light for it's size. It's more than easy to read.
5,"Great Watch, great deal","My father bought me most of my watches until my 30's. It became a tradition, and since he had impeccable taste the watches were usually Omega.What happened was that periodically I used to lose them and then had to wait for him to bring me another one from Europe.When the quartz mechanism came along I started buying watches on my own, principally Seiko. And then one day when I lost my watch, again, I bought a Timex quartz. The only cheap looking thing about it was the band, which I replaced with a Speidel band. As far as reliability goes it has never failed.Since that day, over 20 years ago I have always worn Timex watches. My latest unit is this Easy Reader model, whose off-white dial is very appealing. The leather band is good enough that I have not felt the need to replace it.This is simply put a great value."
1,Didn't even last a day!,"Actually, I would have given the Grinder negative stars, but that's not an option offered.Gears gave out! What an expensive piece of junk! They didn't even use good metal on the parts, metal pieces were a conglomerate of metals, very lightweight. Definitely NOT for a PRO."
1,Junk,"I purchased one of these refurbished and was left with a very poor impression. The aluminum feed tube is a crude casting. It mates with the motor body with another crude plastic piece. This is held in place with an indent in the tube that is imprecise and confusing. When I put the thing together, I hoped that at least the performance would contradict or justify the poor fabrication. When I started feeding chopped pork shoulder (no bones) into it, it started to bang and vibrate like it was going to fall apart. It managed to grind the meat, but I sent it back anyway. I looked at the rest of it, and the only thing impressive about it is the stainless steel sheet that covers up the motor. The rest is cheap plastic. This was a real disappointment for me because I own a Waring deep frying and am deeply impressed with everything about it."
1,Solution for feed screw slipping,"We found a similar problem to many of the other 1 star ratings -that after a few uses, the feed screw would dis-engage from the motor. We realized that the cutting blade and plate were not sitting flush within the housing, and were held out too far by the feed screw, which itself did not engage fully with the motor. If you look at the rear end of the feed screw, there are 3 metal washers encasing a nylon washer, and held in place by a circlip. We removed 2 of the metal washers, leaving one to support the nylon washer, and the feed screw now sits far enough back so the cutting blade and plate now sit flush within the housing. The grinder now works fine! It is a bad design flaw that Waring could easily overcome, and results in many bad reviews for what is otherwise a good value for money grinder for occasional useage."
1,Grigory Faynshteyn,"Very poor quality product. I understand that nothing last forever, but after 2 years of very mild use meat grinder stop working. I would not recommended this product for anyone to buy if you do not waste your money."
2,"Ok, but not a great meat grinder..","I bought this Waring grinder because I wanted to try grinding my own meat before investing a lot of money, so I wanted to try it out first. For lean meat cuts, with no fat, sinew, or tendon, it works pretty well. Also if you want to grind cooked meats, it also works very well. Using it as a sausage stuffer (which comes with the machine) does well as long as you don't have the grinding blade on while stuffing the casings. Anything fatty or sinewy, no matter how much you cut away will jam the grinding blade and blade cutter and require frequent stopping and cleaning. Also, the parts need to be stored in a plastic bag and well oiled as they begin to rust right away. I would recommend anyone with a Kitchen Aid standing mixer, to buy the $50 grinding/stuffing attachment as I have seen that used by one of my friends for the same purpose and it does not get jammed up like this grinder."
1,SHOULD HAVE READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!,This product was a complete waste of money for me. It did not grind simple chuck roast to a satisfactory ground beef and I had to repeatedly remove the cutting plate from the grinder head and then reassemble.Worst of all was the contamination probability. The feed screw (inside the grinder head) backed up meat into the attachment opening and there is no way in the world to get that cleaned and disinfected.I will be putting this machine in the trash - and I hate that because it is a significant sum of money to throw away.
1,muy desepcionado,"buen dia soy un usuario colombiano de amazon hace mas de un año. estoy muy desepcionado con este articulo solo sirvio una ves y se daño, es imposible enviarlo de nuevo por los costos estos seria superiores al costo del articulo. hable con un tecnico y me dice que es una pieza que se rompio completamente"
1,horrible product,"Put some parts that were in contact with meat through dishwasher and it came up completely stripped of the coating. Called Waring pro they said none of their problem since it states not to put it into dishwasher. I have wasted $100 or so, no i will look for something made of cast iron or stainless steel. This POS is not worth the money."
1,Don't buy it,I was very excited about buying a motorized meat grinder. It was easy to assemble but worked very poorly. I was trying to grind beef chunks. The meat kept on getting stuck and the motor jammed. It is all packed to be returned.
1,Piece of junk,"Don't buy this meat grinder: I cut the meat in small pieces, 1 x 2it does not work, it wouldn't grind no matter what, piece of JUNK !"
2,Read the manual first!,"Contrary to the other poor reviews, the grinder had no problems handling beef, pork, or chicken that was cut into 1"" x 2"" x 3"" chunks. The fine blade did a very good job grinding a mix of meats for bockwurst. The coarse blade worked well for a pure pork country sausage.However -- after making two batches of sausage, we put the grinder parts in the dishwasher and ran it overnight. In the morning, what a rusty mess. Here are two direct quotes from the manual (which I'll admit I didn't read until after):- ""Rince these parts in clear hot water, then dry. REMOVEABLE PARTS ARE NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!"" {emphasis is directly from the manual, not mine}- ""Cutting blade {sic} and cutting plate should be coated with cooking oil after washing and then wrapped in grease-proof paper to keep them lubricated and rust-free.""In this day and age, there is no excuse for making parts that are not dishwasher safe. Even the plates to our old hand grinder were stainless."
5,Gormet rib eye burgers at last. Great value.,"I saw the iffy reviews but decided to try one anyway after spotting it at Lowes. I wanted something to grind the ribeyes and chuck roasts I get at Costco and this thing kicks you know what. You slice the meat in 1"" to 11/2"" thick strips up to 1 foot of so long and its grinds with no problems,I use the medium grate as the small makes burgers too dense and heavy like a meat loaf. As for the lack of stainless blade, just a quick spray of olive oil or canola before storage and the blade is stainless enough. Very pleased with machine and I see no cheap plastic parts people have talked about in earlier reviews."
1,A hand grinder is a better option and more reliable...Waring Pro should be ashamed!!,"I purchased this grinder despite the negative reviews to make homemade italian sausage. I used it once to grind 5 pounds of pork and it worked great. The next time I used it the gears broke. Luckily I was within the 30 day warranty. So, I returned the grinder and reluctantly got another one instead a refund. I used the grinder once, worked perfectly. The second time I used it I got through 4 pounds of meat (cut in very small cubes and assembled correctly I might add) and it started smoking and burned up. It smelled like burning plastic. This grinder/motor is so poorly and cheaply built. Waring Pro should be ashamed selling junk like this!! I think I'll go back to the old hand grinder....They're more reliable."
1,I actually rate is zero stars...does not work and never has properly...,"I just submitted this to the My Stuff comment, or whatever it is --- we are trying to get an address where to RETURN this product. It was received in early June but was not even opened until middle of July...never worked right from the start -- had to keep messing with it to do anything...sometimes it did and sometimes NOT!!!~Today we tried to grind some meat again (and we are not inexperienced as had another meat grinder for 30 years)...was not working...stop and start...there is something wrong with the ""fit"" here...the grinder blade just does not fit in there right and cannot get it to work the way it should without shaking it, starting stopping, taking it apart...and then if you press on it a certain way sometimes it will grind.We need to RETURN this item for a full refund...it has NOT worked from the start."
2,"Great buy for price, but very disappointed with durability","My husband and I bought one a month ago and worked great... the first time. We did have some problems at first but realized the blade was put in wrong, after we fixed this we ground over 10 lbs of meat (venison & pork) in about 2 minutes. The second time we used it, it broke, and we didn't grind as much meat as we had the first time! Needless to say it will be returned today!"
1,Waring Pro MG100 ...Save Your Money,"Used carefully and as directed, the Waring Pro worked for a few pounds,then internal gears started to slide by one another intermittently,then it quit entirely. I took it apart and low and behold, cheap plastic gears. Of course it very quickly wore out! Save your money and buy a quality product."
1,Waring MG100,"I just tried this again for the third time - waste of time. The the augur doesnt push the meat thru well, the plates clog up making them very hard to clean. Guess I will have to break out the old hand grinder. By the way, this says it is a 300 watt, yet it says ther motor is 150 watt. Which is correct? For what this cost, I could have bought a lot of meat already ground up!! Dont waste your money on this piece of, well, junk to be nice!"
2,Uncomfortable and not worth the price,"Do not buy this keyboard. I bought it last year because I liked the feel of my Sony Vaio laptop keyboard and wanted something similar for my desktop PC.However, this keyboard is not comfortable to type on. The keys paradoxically too soft most of the time but will jam if you hit them on a corner. The ergonomic curve touted by the manufacturer does nothing for comfort.If you want a slim laptop-like keyboard, get the ""Precision Squared Fashion Keyboard"" (google search for it). It is the PC version of the Macally Icekey keyboard and is much more comfortable and well as being full sized."
2,No good!,Although it looks good. This keyboard is very uncomfortable. Low life span... failed after 14 months!
2,Not Very Impressed.,"10 years ago I bought a similar set of hanging flatware from Bed Bath & Beyond, and 10 years later, it still looks brand new (polished chrome finish).6 months ago I bought this set, and it already looks 20 years old. The knives have rust spots on them from the dishwasher, and the entire set has gone from shiny to dull from my roommates hand washing them with rough sponges. In contrast, the set I got from BB&B; has been washed hundreds of times with 3M pads with no scratching, no dulling.Additionally, this set only has 4 of each item! That means that after 1 meal you have to run your entire dishwasher or you have no silverware...dumb. My other set has 8 of each item...unfortunately afer scouring the internet, it no longer exists and people are stuck buying Walmart quality sets like this one.Now I have to buy a SECOND set just to have enough silverware to not have to run my dishwasher every single day."
1,missing forks!!,"Just gave them for Christmas Present and had 4 missing forks!! it was very dissapointing!! The rest is really nice, now I have to return it from international country."
5,Love love love it!,I have been eying sets like this for some time. This is a nice modern set that is actually sturdy and holds up pretty well. In the hand there is some weight to it and actually are in great comparison to the set I wanted from crate and barrel.
4,Happy to find good quality hanging cutlery but really should be service for 4!!!!,I have been looking for years to replace our counter top cutlery and was happy to find this good quality set. There are many less expensive hanging sets out there but I don't think they will hold up to even a piece of chicken. The style is plain and I would have preferred a less Danish appearance but I think the quality makes up for it. One complaint is that you cannot buy the cutlery without the hanger so if you want a service for 8 you have to buy 2 sets! At least the set could have been for 6 because service for 4 is pretty much useless.
1,MISSING FLATWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I waited anxiously for this hanging flatware set!I only received ""THREE"" salad forks, ""THREE"" dinner forks""THREE"" small spoons, ""THREE"" large spoons~WHY??????????????"
2,Interesting man -- novice writers tried their best but...,"Fox's granddaughter and her husband wrote the book, and its obvious they are not professionals. They also aren't experts on movies, and I don't know what is or isn't accurate about Fox because so much of the events and dialogue are obviously ""creative non-fiction,"" and corny at that. I can say it is not boring, and they tried so hard I almost feel ashamed to be critical."
5,A brilliant book,Two thumbs up!!! This book is the compeling story of William Fox behind the glitz and glamour of the movie buisness. What makes this book so hard to put down was that it made the reader feel as if he or she was right there with William Fox throughout his buisness deals and career because of all the interesting dialogue. Finally a biography that is not dry and easy to read through!!!
4,Updated and improved,Great book! Weaves George's Washington's story in with events that were happening at the same time to give an interesting take on history. Kids love it!
4,excellent school resource,I love how this book places you in the world of current events of George Washington's life. it really gives a wonderful perspective on the historical events of the time.
4,Lots of information!,"Once again, a Genevieve Foster book chock-full of information, people, and events. I love the way she gives depth to the historical facts, reminding us that many things in history tend to happen at the same time in different areas of the world. The kids tend to think the chapter sections are too long, and the book is slightly tedious as a read-aloud, but you can't beat the amount of information given."
5,Great!,This is a wonderful for way for your child to get a quick review of several people. It's divided into several short stories. My girls beg to read it everyday.
4,Love the book....miss the hard cover!,"We fell in love with this book while reading through it as part of our history class. The library book had a hardcover and felt very substantial. While the information is the same, the paperback version isn't quite the same. Still, I would HIGHLY recommend this book....a great read!"
1,disapointed,"This did not work for me at all, not even slightly. I ordered 2 packeages and used them both. No results. I would NOT oreder again."
1,Horrid,"Bought the Magnavox DV200MW8 at a local Walmart. Worked fine for about 2 hours. Later, VHS playback is fuzzy with distorted video and DVD player will not read DVD.Will never buy another Magnavox product based on this."
1,Defective Straight Out Of The Box,"The price was right; unfortunately, the unit did not work. The VCR would not record. Magnavox's customer service is great; I called the 1-800 number and was treated promptly and courteously. However, the unit is defective and will have to be returned."
1,Not as expected,"I picked one up from Walmart this afternoon and it's already not working. It plays a DVD good, but it will not play a tape at all. I have tied serval videos and he best I got was a partial plyback during rewind. I don't think that is going to cut it. Most of the time it gets stuck in DVD made with no DVD in the player and has to be unpluged to get it so you can even use the remote again. Mabey I got a lemon, but this product is heading back to the Wally Mart."
4,"Good Player, Good Value, No Coax Cable Output","The product works well and the controls are user-friendly. The only downside is that there is no coax (cable) output so you can't use this by tuning to channel 3 (as you use to do with most VCRs). There are other outputs and this probably isn't a problem for most people, but some older users who are more comfortable with the channel 3 solution might take a while to figure out where the Input button is on their TV remote."
1,Response to recent order,"The dvd/vcr combo was used,I thought I was buying new. The unit did not work and the remote was to another unit. I was upset because I had to go to the post office and send it back. It was time consuming and costly.I did get my money back on what I paid to send the unit back.Amazon should make it clear if buying new, I also thought I was buying from a company."
2,Snookered,"Under Product Details the size is listed as 36 x 1 x 1 inches and further down the Amazon page under Product Description the size is listed as 3/16"". Do not buy this if you need a 36"" x 1"" diameter undergravel riser tube since they ship a 3/16"" outside diameter air hose tube, as described further down the page. The 36"" small tubes where coiled in a 20"" x 20"" bag and needed to be heated up to get them straight again."
2,Bent out of shape,"This tubing arrived bent in a 180 degree angle in a box that was too small for it. Why not ship it in a poster tube?!!Luckily I only need a short section to complete my co2 diffuser, but where I'd normally keep the leftover piece for future use, I think I'll have to toss it. What good is this bent up to me? I don't think I should have to resort to heating it to straighten it out like the previous commenter.Revisit how you ship this thing!"
5,One of the Best,"I have certainly received my money's worth...this album is phenomenal. One of my favorite Air albums, I can listen through the whole thing while studying or driving without skipping any tracks. And for years, even. The classical piece at the end is gorgeous. Often reminds me of Moon Safari, with a taste of more calculated sounds, maybe even a little Neverending Story feeling. Intoxicating musicscapes that stick with you all day, in the best of ways."
3,Hardly walks what it talks,"Breathy electro is weighed down by too much arrangement fluff despite a few genuinely innovative songs, downgrading the disc from amazing to acceptable."
4,Yet another review...,"After 70 previous reviews, I was reluctant to add my 2 bobs worth, but, hey, why not? Better than Moon Safari for me, but both are enjoyable and worth buying. My girlfriend, who had never heard Air before, went into a bit of a trance when I played the disk in the car. Cherry Blossom Girl is delightful and the album is worth buying for that song alone. For lovers of synthesised sounds and daydreaming."
1,ARGH!! What have they done?,"This album was a huge disappointment, from someone who has all of their previous works. Realizing it's hard to top Moon Safari, 1000hz and Premier Symptomes were really excellent, and unique albums. Talkie Walkie, however is a total ""pop"" sell-out album. They completely lose the break-beat grooviness of all their previous albums, for basically pablum spoon fed, lameness. Someone should have told them they cannot sing, for christ sakes!! BARF!I'm still a die-hard Air fan however, and willingly buy any of their future albums, but am hoping I don't have to throw away any more money on crap like ""Talkie Walkie"" OMG!@!!!!@#$@#$"
3,okay until they started singing,"I'd liked it, but I have an embarrasing weakness for the sort of synth-pop they use in the movies to invoke feeling of loneliness. You know, the kind of gentle, semi-futuristic, electronia stuff that usually accompanies a fly over of the big city at night.My only complaint is when the band does their own vocals. They can't sing very well, and the high pitched french accent with the unsophisticated lyrics turns me off a bit. I'm sure it's not the case, but their singing makes it hard not to assume there's some homosexual undertones, particularly on songs with titles like ""Surfing on a Rocket""."
4,Walkie Talkie Thingamobobby,"A very solid effort with very little in the way of filler.For some weird reason this album reminds me of 10cc fast forward to 2005. There are hooks throughout but it's not a pop album per say.There's an underling tension that draws you back from the hooks andherein lies the secret and the genius of this album. Maybe it's cultural, maybe it's devised, but whatever the reason, it works. If you can get past your first impression of Walkie Talkie and move past any preconcieved notions of Air, this album has a whole lot to offer. Enjoy!"
3,Disappointing,"Not what I expected from Air. I've been so happy listening to Moon Safari all these years (as well as everyone else that I know) and was very excited to hear their new CD and possibly even watch them in concert in April, but then I listened to it and wasn't very impressed. Nothing on there really moved me, except maybe Cherry Blossom Girl. But I had already listened to that off of my Lost in Translation soundtrack. I'd much rather listen to that soundtrack than this CD. Sorry."
4,more and more complex they get...,first off i could have burned the cd 2months before it hit the stores !!! but im glad i didnt well worth waiting plus i like the dvd after you listen to this album everything else sounds to normal and boring more of a lay back album nothing u could play at a party not in this world at least ! the lyrics get kinda sloppy but they are french it must not be so easy for them but it doesnt matter cuz this album is so complex its not even music its art stand out tracks for me would have to be ALL of them but the ones i listen to the most would have to be '' VENUS RUN ANOTHER DAY great songs HZ LEGEND was a great album as well but hz had songs i just couldnt get into songs that i skip but not walkie talkie all there songs are very masterd very complex the only other band that i could love as much as air would have to be broadcast another gem alot of people dont know of pick up a copy of talkie walkie its a must have ..
2,lots of sugar-sweet lyrics on this one,"This time around the band went for a lot of singing in almost all of the tracks. The lyrics are coy and sweet. Very very French Pop-music. And the songs in general are more conventionally arranged with a real chorus and verse. Air makes great music but the silly lyrics bring my score way down here. Air should look to the band ""Luna"" about how to make coy lyrics that are also intentionally and successfully ironic. Or keep the lyrics out of the music alltogether."
4,"Compared to the rest, Air is the best...","I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars because this album doesn't quite live up to the majesty of Air's earlier albums. But comapred to most albmus out there, this would be a 5 out of 5.Obviously a listener has to have a preference for this style of music (I would describe it as electro-funk-new wave), and if you do, this album should definitely be in your collection. But if you're new to the genre, try Moon Safari first."
1,Don't buy this CD,"I bought this CD from Amazon and I think the music ispretty good, that is, if you can play it!This CD is copy protected. It didn't play on my computerand I had to the use paper clip to manually force theCD out of the computer drive. I didn't play on my boombox either.I listen to almost all my CD's on my MP3 player. I'mnot a pirate, I pay for everything I listen to but Irefuse to let the record companies dictate how I willlisten to my musicDon't support copy protection by buying this CD!"
5,Brilliant,I can't stop listening to this album. I'm a big fan of their early singles and Moon Safari of course. 10000 Hz just didn't cut it for me. I thought they went in a completely different direction then what I wanted. But this one really shines. It's beautiful inventive and intoxicating.
1,A Waste,"Talkie Walkie is a waste of resources. The distorted tones make many of the cuts sound like they are out of tune. The vocals sound like they were recorded by zombies. All in all, I thought it was pretty boring. I bought the album because the last cut is pretty good. There are a few other cuts that are not bad. But most of it is pretty awful."
1,Crítica que acaricia lo aspero...,"Ta bueno loco eh!Mira vos.. franceses, que loco. Pensé que solo se dedicaban a los autos. Igual son medios chorros, ya existe Bjork.Acá en La Plata está fresco, un saludo a todos, especialmente para vos Ricky.El Tecla"
3,Will grow on you,"Thank goodness, Air is on the right track, redeeming themselves partially after the 10,000 Hz Legend fiasco. Granted, this doesn't have the same hypnotic-blow you away immediately effect of Moon Safari, but what album does?My favorite track is ""Cherry Blossom Girl"". Like ""Moon Safari"", every track transitions to the next one very well, making it an whole album experience, instead of playing your favorite two tracks only.This album will grow on you after playing a few times. The only thing sorely lacking is whoever did the vocals on ""All I Need"" from Moon Safari. She was incredible. On that note, less vocals by JB Dunckel and Nicolas Godin would have made this a 4 star album."
3,OK but first and last copy controlled disc I buy,I won't even go about the music which is OK but the freaking copy protection prevents the disc from being played on my computer. If Air and other artists want to be alienated in this way by lining behind the record labels then it is fine but this is the first AND last copy controlled disc I buy. And this is from someone that foolishly shelves the cash for legal software instead of downloading/borrowing/ripping/stealing/whatever they want to call it.
2,Sounds like a parody of themselves.,"I've had this album for a year now, hoping my initial view of it would change, but it hasn't. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the overall sound of this album sounds like a parody of their music. Not only that, it feels thin, formulaic, and lacking tasteful re-invention of their musical influences compared to their previous releases. Alpha Beta Gaga stood out the most for me on this album; a pretty sweet whistle tune, actually. If your new to AIR check out Premiers Symptomes first and go from there. You'll find some warm, dreamy, soulful instrumentation a la Serge Gainsbourg. Do not visit Montreal without this music!"
