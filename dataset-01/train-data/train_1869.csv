4,The most comprehensive succulent identification I've seen.,"I was able to identify 156 specimens growing in my fourteen year old living succulent wreath. The plants photographed in their natural habitat were useful because the gave clues to their culture. I winced because light and temperature requirements were not included, but then again, that would probably make the book too heavy to cart around the garden."
4,in a few words,"Very beautiful book, with as much colorfull pictures as you wish. The title should be ""dictionary of globular cacti"", because only such species are presented."
3,Okay costume,"This costume doesn't come with much. It comes with pom poms, a top, and a skirt. It doesn't come with tights or shoes."
1,SCARY,"I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, ""WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN"". I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE ""CREW"" WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE."
4,Dizzy History,"18 hits by the young Gillespie and his group. Video quality varies (perhaps 5 moments of over-exposure), but is usually very good (considering the age of these videos). Definitely worth the very reasonable price for any Dizzy fans. Dizzy's band has 4 trumpets (plus Dizzy), 4 saxes, 2 trombones, pianist John Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson and bassist Ray Brown. Many numbers feature dancers in various styles (Tap, Swing, Exotic, etc.) and vocalists (notably, Helen Hume). There are a couple of numbers featuring a Hammond Organ/Piano duo. On occasion, the sound is not perfectly synchronized with the video.All numbers are excerpted from a 1947 film entitled, ""Jivin' in Be-Bop"". Running time, a little over 50 minutes."
1,rip off - complete waste of money,"This is an infomercial for a ""makeup institute"", a school for makeup in San Diego. At best, this video may serve as a promotional gift item to be given out for free to prospective students... maybe. Why pay $30 for an infomercial that doesn't even inform much? We get to see a lame demo of one makeup look, not even demonstrated by a recognized makeup professional! The whole thing is about 20 minutes long, has no menus and was burned on a computer, rather than replicated. Very amateurish! What a rip off!"
1,Makeup Techniques for Creating a Flawless Face,"Really BAD! Big price little content. One quick make up and the DVD was over. I order lots of make up books, tapes and DVD's and this one was a rip off."
1,CD Primer of Biostatistics,Its very disappointing because the CD doesn't work with Windows 7. Its incredible because every new computer has Windows 7.Rodulfo
4,Log Cabin Classics,Nice little hard back book about the construction of smaller log cabins. It has many pictures and plans with links for those considering building a more conservative log home. It's good for the first time builder or someone dreaming about possibly owning a log cabin.
4,Great idea starter!,I bought it for my father to get him excited about building his own. He keeps it on his desk in the den. It's a pretty book and people enjoy looking at it. Great idea starter!
5,Great for Backyardigan Fans!,This is an adorable beanie baby! It makes a perfect gift for any kid who loves the Backyardigans. This is an excellent toy based on a very fun show for little ones.
5,Just like the character on tv,Pablo looks just like he does on The Backyardigans. The only problem is the propeler on his hat is made of faux leather (or vinyl) and my daughter started to bite it off. I suggest cutting that off if your little one likes to put things in his/her mouth.
3,A little small,"Pablo is very cute and in good condition, but much smaller than his firend Tyrone. We are satisfied with him, just wish we could find one that is bigger and not mechanical."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!!,"If you Love Michael Jackson, as I do and if you are still one of his biggest fans, as I am...Then please Do NOT support this DVD by purchasing it!! It was nothing like it sounds...All it does is rehash his first accusation of molestation and BASHES him the whole way through, calling him a pedeofile (sp?). It was so awful that it just upset me all over again! Please do not support the ugly media which once again condemns, accuses, and bashes this innocent, loving, caring man. In addition the DVD IS MISLEADING. It says it's a M.J. DVD, however, this DVD has two other clips having nothing even to do with Michael Jackson! The story about Michael is only about 10-15 minutes long!! I want my money back!"
3,A short Escape,This is not a particularly long or a thought provoking read. The art is OK but ultimately this is a bit of pulp fiction with shock value thrown in to appeal to a teenage male audience. This isnt one of Ennis's best bits of work but it isnt bad for a comic book and it has its funny moments. The Kev series works much better than this. If you came to this book because you like the preacher you may well be dissapointed.
2,ho hum,this was pretty weak compared to ennis' other work. there were a few amusing moments but this is skipable. it's not bad but its not something that i'll be re reading anytime soon.
3,"Not Ennis' best, but a good satirical send-up","The Pro - like The Boys - is another one of Ennis' send-ups of superhero stereotypes. Despite the protagonist being a prostitute, it's not as over-the-top as later issues of Preacher or The Boys. Sure, it's for adults, and it definitely skewers superhero culture... but its (comparatively) conventional story seems to weaken Ennis' shocking punch.But that's *comparatively* conventional, and *comparatively* weakens. Ennis is still in good form here, and Ms. Conner's artwork is a delight in depravity and redemption alike. Well worth the read!"
4,Must have sense of humor to enjoy,"This was so offensive and simultaneously so funny that I wasn't sure what to think of it at first. But, I have to say, I enjoyed it and would buy more tales of the Pro if any follow."
3,The Pro,"I guess I should have read this prior to reading the 'Preacher' series. Not Garth Ennis's best work. Where as Preacher cast a critical eye on our political and religious beliefs, and how the two are so deeply enmeshed, this book was mainly fluff about a prostitute becoming a super hero. I guess there is something slightly redemptive in that; except she keeps her night job!"
1,"Awful, awful book...","This is a truly terrible book, one of the very few I've just thrown away it was so bad. For many, the pure vulgarity of it may be enough of a turn-off, so be warned it is extreme. But what I despised most about the book is that Garth Ennis flat-out hates superheroes, and this is his big middle finger to superheroes comics and their fans. This isn't satire, this is an insult.Amazon needs to add a zero stars rating. This would get one."
3,Not Perfect But Still Good,"Despite being a Garth Ennis fangirl, I think he can overdo it at times. And this was one of the problems with The Pro. I can understand that a down-on-her-luck hooker having a foul mouth, but even I got a little sick of all the swearing after a while (along with some other moments) to the point that it felt a little like shock.Ennis does make some good points on the necessity of superheroes, how there might be things lurking under their goodie-goodie surface and I liked The Ho side story. I even warmed up a bit to the main character and her uses for her powers were amusing and I could see it happening with any woman in her position. While it's not my favorite Ennis story, he still does a fairly entertaining job."
2,Not worth it!,"Ok, I read the reviews. I am truly stupid for not ""reading"" the reviews. Really, this book isn't that good. Even for fans of Garth Ennis. Skip it.This book reads like it was written by a bunch of ten year olds. Now, shame on me for not reading the other reviews that said ""this book was written by a bunch of ten year olds."" Because that's basically what you're getting. Let's take the premise which is a prostitute gets super powers and comes across the Justice League. That's it.Yes, I love comic books. Yes, I love Garth Ennis. Yes, I've read the Preacher and The Boys. They're crude at times but still tell a story. This doesn't have much of a story. I'm sorry that I didn't skip it. Unless you're a die-hard fan...."
3,"Fun, but not much of a purchase.","This title is entirely about humor. At least it should be. I have two problems with this comic book. First, it's basically a big joke, but none of the jokes are really that funny. I'd be somewhat surprised if most guys haven't heard jokes around these lines at some point or another, or at least heard some of them. Then there's a bit of ""everybody is good inside,"" in there as well. The only problem is it's not just a bit. There's large pieces that are entirely uninteresting and don't match the tone of the rest of the comic. It is, however, good for a cheap laugh or two as long as you don't mind some dirtier stuff. For some reason people think that perverted jokes and so on can happen on TV and in movies, but not in print."
1,Dictionay it is,Sorry I bought it. Though I am sure there is a place for this book it was not what I needed as a tourist.
2,WHAT'S THE SENSE OF THIS BOOK,"THIS BOOK HAS SOME ASTROLOGY ETC. YES THAT'S GOOD. BUT IT'S A BOOK ABOUT TAROT SPREADS.WHERE ARE THE DETAILS FOR THE SPREADS? IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE COMPLETE TAROT SPREADS GIVE THEM MORE DETAILS ON THE SPREADS. NOT JUST PAST-PRESENT-FUTURE OR 1-2-3. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PAST POSITION REALLY MEANS, ETC. EVEN ONE LINE WOULD DO. ANYONE COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK. JUST THINK OF SOME CATCHY NAMES FOR THE POSITIONS, NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY MEAN AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BOOK. AND OH, WHY HAVE THEY GIVEN US THE CELTIC CROSS SPREAD IN ABOUT TEN VARIATIONS AND CALLED IT 10 SPREADS WHEN IT'S JUST 1 SPREAD WHERE THE CARDS CAN BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY?I GAVE IT TWO STARS FOR THE ASTROLOGY PART. PLEASE WORK ON THE SPREADS AND GET BACK TO US WITH A REVISED EDITION. IF IT'S AS PRACTICAL AS THE ASTROLOGY PART PEOPLE WILL BUY IT."
5,Another great Albert Hill release!,"The ""All-for-Me Theology"" is an outstanding release from one of the greatest, unknown pop-rock bands to date. With songs like ""The Press"", ""Better Times"", and ""Two Part Traveling"" you can't go wrong. Unfortunately this album marked the end for Albert Hill, as Robbie Bowen left the band the following year (fortunately the band was resurrected as Dezeray's Hammer). If you don't have this album you should buy it right now. Also, collector's look for the Windjammer's Live 1998 album for a great live version of ""Better Times""."
5,A must for any budding entrepreneur,"Ok, so you want to start your own business but do not have a business degree? Don't know the rules of the game? Then do buy this book and read it thoroughly. I still use it as a guide in my little internet startup that I formed a few years ago. A must have for anyone with no business background but still wants to make it big :)"
5,Essential Reading,"Don't be fooled by the reviews of this book so far. This book is a must read for anyone developing products from technology to services. Unbelievable insight. The context is out of date as it was published just as the web was just starting to take off. But the book is still incredibly relevant.This isn't just for technology companies, but as far as I am concerned, it should be required reading for all project managers."
3,"Enjoyable, but with missing pieces","I enjoyed reading this book, especially because it focuses so much on anecdotes. I definitely understood Drucker's point that innovation and entrepreneurship come out of changes in the environment.However, I believe Drucker missed the most important point, which is: What makes someone more able to exploit an opportunity than someone else? For example, he tells a story about how Ray Krok found out about McDonalds, bought it, and made it great. However, I thought he should have focused on why it was Ray Krok, and no one else, who saw the opportunity, rather than how he bought and made McDonalds. It is an entertaining read, but do not expect any lessons on how to be an entrepreneur."
5,Great piece of work,"Great author, great book and it's definitely worth reading. Not sure how it does against contemporary innovation ideas, but certainly a good place to start."
5,Amazing!,Book came sooner than expected and in great condition! Great book on entrepreneurship! I recommend for any one interested in this type f business.
4,An entrepreneur classic.,"An entrepreneur classic. Tremendous insight from an innovative opportunity & entrepreneurial management standpoint. As always, I highly recommend all of Peter Drucker's books."
1,"Nothing new, politician's book, not for business and not technology related","The book is full of shallow historical, or political view regarding innovation and enterprenueship. Nothing new and examples are organized amess. Too many words for too few knowledge. A wast of time in reading."
4,Good Read,"The writing style is fluid and many industry examples are given to illustrate the author's point. There is a lot of meat in this book which provides a framework for the thought process. I don't necessarily agree with all his concepts. He considers entrepreneurship to be an organized process and not a by-product of talent. I personally think it is a combination. You need resources but you also need to know how to use it. In some segments of the book, he offers no explanation for certain successes and treats entrepreneurship as something that happens despite planning to the contrary. There are some minor contradictions. Still, some of his thoughts are timeless, thought provoking and valuable. The purpose therefore is to continue to explore new ideas and try it on for size."
3,average,"I had expected a little bit more. Richard Diehl's ""The Olmec. America's First Civilization"" is a typical Thames and Hudson ""Ancient People and Places"" Publication (like M. Coe's ""The Maya"" or R. Townsend's ""The Aztec""): ""reader friendly"" as expressed by another review, clearly not too academic (that means dissapointing to the scholar), light style. Probably due to the lack of data there is quite a lot of speculation and repetition. Like the recent ""Olmeca: Balance y Perspectivas""-Roundtable it is very much a proof that not much has happened since 1996 ""The Olmec World-Ritual and Rulership"". It is still nice reading and surely informative for travellers, beginning students and laymen alike."
2,Poorest Graphics!,The photography and graphics in this book are the poorest I have seen in a very long time in books of similar interest. This is a shame as image clarity is extremely important to understanding the culture and especially the art of the Olmec. That is the only thing that we have left of the Olmecs.
4,reference,"Yes.... all you get is all of the functions listed in alphabetical order.... how to use them, different ways you can use them, what kinds of errors will spawn from a function, and also, what kinds of functions to coincide with the use of it. The OpenGL programmers Guide is excellent by itself... this just tells you what's inside (function wise) ... doesn't tutor you on anything, that's why you always need a programmers reference..... you necessairly don't need this book with the programmers guide, you'll get along fine with it. But this is a quick reference, and that's never bad"
2,Louis Jordan Swing Era DVD (Short Review),Idem Home Video apparently couldn't be bothered to synch the audio with the video.Jerks.
3,I'll Take Louis Jordan Even Outta Synch,"Great for Louis Jordan fans and those who want to explore the beginnings of rock and roll, but beware!: the technical aspects of this video are poor. For most of the performances the video has horrible contrast problems and the audio is out of synch with the picture which makes it painful to watch, although some of the performances are cleaner and the track is in synch. The soundies were the 1940s precursor to the MTV music videos. The band and Louis are playing against various backdrops; college classrooms, recording studios, night clubs, and even a dude ranch with Louis all cowboyed up. Louis has to be the happiest purveyor of the blues I've ever seen. He was also a solid musician and one of the best alto sax players of any age. I just wish someone would take these soundies and digitally remaster them. They are definitely worth saving for posterity."
2,Disappointed,Not as much music or dancing as I'd hoped.Very chopped up.The sound is not good.I will be reluctant to order anything like this again.
4,great horror music!!,"this is a band that i stumbled on by accident. i was at harmony house when they were going out of business and it looked like some good death metal with a sick cover and a sick name for a band i figured i should check it out. the quality is pretty bad on this because it is demo songs, but it has killer riffs and crazy vocals from Killjoy. I would recomend getting one of their studio albums if you never heard them, but this is a killer collection of great horror music and i'm glad i picked up a copy. this is most deff a band that got slept on. most people don't know who they are and it's sad because they are really a talented band. even did work with Phil Anselmo from Pantera. it's worth checking out."
3,"Wide beaches, narrow minds","This novel, set in North Carolina before World War II, was originally reviewed as a piece on genteel antisemitism. It is more than that, more a study of the mores and society of small-town Tidewater South. As a period piece, it is sometimes overwrought but still manages to capture the darker side of a smug little town where everybody knew each other, sometimes with tragic results."
3,"Public Education, you are on your own.","Dog issues exist because no one is interested in taking on the responsibility of doing anything about them. That is the only reason the book was written.Compared to the number of dog bites per year, the number of deaths is insignificant. That is why the government is not doing much of anything about it. However, these deaths are so horrible, that some of the responders have had or are still in therapy.The sad part of it is all of the deaths were preventable. The government stresses education as the best means of reducing dog bites and deaths, but they are not doing it. Very few schools have dog bite programs, even though over 70% of the victims are children.You are on your own, you have to be aware of the dog.I really do not know how to rate the book, as there has been no feedback on the book's website.The Author"
5,"Entertaining, enlightening and important!",This is the masterpiece that led to the Emmy award winning documentary! A must read!Divided Highways is packed with personal stories and historic markers... read this book and you'll never be bored while driving again. Your entire perspective on the web of roads across America and how they came to be will forever be changed!Highly reccomended!
4,Very interesting.,A great overview of the politics and logistics behind the world's largest public works project. A lively story.
1,Avoid. Keyboard Did Not Work,"Easy to setup. But, keyboard did not work. Defective. Keys were jammed. Returned. Recommend avoiding. Buying a different model."
1,Stopped Working after 6 months!,"Looks like this product is no longer available, so I guess this is a useless review. However, the entire top row of letter keys stopped working. I bought this back in April, 2009, and it just stopped working today (12/27/2009). Tried everything to get it to work again, to no avail. Shame on you logitech for having this built in China."
5,A good read for any franchise owner,This book is good for any business person in a franchise that is going a bit tough ... Michael went through what I could only imagine was a horrific situation and came out the other end with flying colors.The book will give you the passion to continue. Other books will give you the `how to' and that is needed - this one gives you the strength.Nic
3,Go for the larger caliber,"kinda too small to hold with a wrist rocket. Opt for the larger size, even if theyre less count. You wont use that many anyways"
2,Is this offer legit?,"This is a classic and pioneering book in its field, and despite the notoriety that its subsequently Nobel-laureate author may have gained later in life, a masterly exposition of the basic ideas of semiconductor physics by one of the pioneers in the field, well worth scanning today. It presents among other things the ""tilted parking garage"" model to explain how holes in the valence band behave exactly like electrons in the conduction band -- except for an apparently positive charge for the holes. But is this a legitimate offer for this book? I believe that the same book can be obtained without much difficulty from other used book dealers for $100 or under -- which isprobably a fair indication of the book's value."
4,Looks cool,"Bought this for my 10/22, installation was easy. Make sure you have some loctite. I added this, to make my gun look coo...success!"
4,Nice looking watch with some extra features,"This is my first watch after years of relying on my cellular phone.The watch is smaller then other brand watches and fit nicely on thin arms like mine.It takes some time to the leather strap to get soft so it's a bit uncomfortable at the first few weeks.It is very simple to operate and you will be able to read the time without looking in no time.The watch hands glows green at night.I wish it had more features like date and even a compass.The touch glass has great touch sense, more like modern cell phone.I would recommend this watch for everyone who has thinner hands then average and want to have a modern/classic watch."
1,Streaks and Smudges,"I can't get this replacement cartridge to print without streaks and smudges on the page. I would definitely not order it again, despite the appealing price."
4,"Washington, Dandridge, Tharpe, Brown and others","Indeed; calling this DVD Dinah Washington and friends is bad, misleading and unfair... Therefore only 4 stars.On the other hand, fans of swing jazz and some similar genres (including boogie woogie!) might like to own this DVD with these short musical films starring these singers, artists, players and entertainers:Dinah Washington, Ruth Brown, Dorothy Dandridge, Martha Davis, Faye Adams, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Mabel Lee, June Richmond, Vanita Smythe, Edna Mae Harris. I think I named them all.This is a bonanza for us nostalgia fans (incidentally, I seem to be nostalgic about the era not even my MOTHER was yet born in, but too each his own...)"
3,Not enough Dinah,"Swing Era, Dinah Washington and Friends.I did not think there was enough Dinah Washington. I'm sure there is footage of her in other countries that could have been added to this collection. Other than that this was a fine collection. Beware, when accessing the other collections, they include some of the same people. I would have liked to see her with Brook Benton, also."
5,Bringing the classics back,Its good to see a company bring these classic figures back and keep as collector's items.
3,kinda flimsy,"I bought this for my mom's car. It fits things, but it won't stay upright for stuff like juice bottles and other taller items."
3,Inaccurate Product Specifications,"The product specifications say""Product Dimensions: 8 x 1.5 x 10.8 inches ; 4 pounds"".This is probably the dimensions of the package, not of the product.This is a product that I might be interested in, if the description was accurate.I am sure that the product must be at least 36 inches long.I am submitting this as a review because I cannot find where to report it.Easy-Access Trunk Organizer"
1,Terrible seller,Wrong description in the add so they sent the wrong watch. When I contacted them they did their best to try and make me feel like it was my fault. They asked me if I wanted to exchange and then stopped correspondence. Had to then contact them to process the return. Terrible customer service....buyer beware
1,nixon watch,I ordered this watch for my boyfriend for christmas. it came in 3 days before christmas with three large scratches across the face of the watch. it was supposed to be new. they also didn't have any more in stock to send in replacement. huge disappointment and hassle
3,Nice watch,This is such a nice watch but it stopped working a month after I gave as a gift. My boyfriend still hasn't taken it in and I just hope it's the battery. Probably wont buy from them again because it was embarrassing for out to have broken so quickly. Luckily he is understanding
2,Too big,I am female and bought this watch. It was much too big for my taste. I returned it and bought another MK style.
4,Count the ways little brown bear,"I gave Count the ways little brown bear 4 stars only because it is just a counting book for kids, but it is a very good counting book. My kids love it and they can't even read yet.When reading time comes lately this book has been the their choice. I suspect it has something to do with the vivid illustrations, but they do hang on every word and it is definately making an impression and it won't be long before they have it memorized. This book would make a great addition to any youngsters library. Educational but still fun. I also think it would be a good idea to consider a Spanish translation version."
3,"Lovely illustrations, good concept","We received this book recently and my son (3 years old) requests that I read it. The book attempts to mesh a traditional counting book with a bedtime story and it succeeds reasonably well. Still, I feel after repeated readings that the story is worded in such a way that some of the natural inflection inherent in regular spoken language is missing, and parts of the story come across sounding awkward."
3,Replacement clip for phone,This item is no longer available at Verizon store so I bought 2 on line. They both broke almost immediately. The clips I had gotten from Verizon had lasted a long time so I was very disapointed.
2,Not worth The Frustration,"These simply break, and oftenThey are cheaply made and either the top clip breaks off or the belt clip breaks.Do yourself a favor and buy the Seidio Spring Clip Holster for Blackberry Curve 8300, 8310, 8320, 8330, 8900 (Wireless Phone Accessory.I did and wish I had bought it a year ago."
1,No Magnet,"Item description and images did not indicate that there was no magnet. Magnet is necessary to make blackberry enter ""sleep"" mode."
2,Not very well designed for handling,"Difficult to take the phone out with one hand, Blocks the camera funtion when in holster."
1,Cheap but not worthy,"It lasted 1 week after my shirt got entangled in the clip and it broke. I had a leather one and thought I would be smart by paying less for something that would have the exact same function. Wrong!!!! I got what I paid for!!!! Curiously, the one I had (with the same swivel rotating belt clip broke after 1 year of use and I had my shirt entangled on it so many times.Advice? DBlackberry Curve 8310 Swivel Rotating Belt Clip Cell Phone Holster - Black Hard Plastic Holster Clipon't buy it!!!"
2,Blackberry Curve Belt Clip review,"The belt clip fit the Blackberry Curve perfectly; however, the clip broke within a week."
2,As reviewed before.... easily breakable.,Great price of course. But is lacking the magnet to have the phone sense it is in holster. Had it for 10 days. On the 10th day it broke while i was getting into my car.
4,Great product,"This belt clip works better than any other case or pouch I tried for this phone, and is much more affordable. Definitely a good item to purchase."
3,Great holster for the money,Great holster for my work berry. My only gripe is it doesn't come with a little magnet which the berry uses to go to sleep when holstered. That magnet came with my co-worker's holster but that one costs $20 while this was a mere fraction of the cost. Not a deal breaker but I would've paid a bit more if it came with one.
2,"Not bad, but could be better","The product it's ok, fit the Blackberry 83xx series good, but it doesn't have the magnet so the blackberry stay on when it's on the holster.Have to modify mine and glue a small magnet."
3,Nice... but rainbow stitching!,"This is a basic collar, with good-quality leather and an interesting color. But beware: the stitching is rainbow threaded!"
5,Best Quick Aim Sight for the money on the planet,"I have bought 3 of these Centerpoint 1 X 34 quick aim red dot scopes and they all work tremendously. I have one on my SKS, one on my Saiga and one on my Mini 30. I have used Leupold Scopes, the best in the business, I have used Burris, Barska, Bushnell & Nikon, they are all good products. But none of these compare to the quality, for the price of the Centerpoint scopes, simply the best. I also own 2 other Centerpoints, 4-16X40 & an a AR22 series.Centerpoint not only makes quality scopes that will hold your groupings and hold your zero, they give all the extras other scope makers don't, like lens covers, lens cleaners, etc., You can see my other review on the Centerpoint 4-16X40 and see, I am a very happy Centerpoint scope owner, multiple times and have 2 years of abusing my rifles to verify, these are quality products that I would recommend to anyone!!!"
5,Aimpoint for less money + green and red dots. A+ quality,"I have used Aimpoints, Acogs, Eotechs, etc and although some of these are better, I might add not by much. Centerpoint gives you BOTH red and green dots and multiple brightness settings and on top of that if your lucky to get the scope rings included it really is a nobrainer. A set of even cheap rings would cost you $30-$50 and the rings are awesome. In fact I know a guy that bought this just for thhe rings. Some charge extra for the rings and count on not getting them if they dont clearly say they are included. Do yourself a favor and buy this amazingly well built and highly accurate red dot. Save your money for buying more rounds because you wont need anything better than this. Soon as people figure out what kind of quality you get with this scope expect prices to rise."
2,OUT OF SYNC,"The selections are good, but on most of the shorts THE SOUND IS OUT OF SYNC! It's the most irritating thing since the glass ketchup bottles. It's all disappointing. Do not buy this unless you want only a couple of performances to look (or is it sound?)right."
1,What a crock,"The folksy advice sounds too good to be true--and it is. How couldn't someone--anyone--have seen that the so-called ""returns"" on investment are rigged? The media waited too long to expose the fact that the authors included club fees in figuring how they supposedly ""beat the market."" In fact, the market beat THEM. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Bah!,"Ok, the ladies did get people interested in investing, but they really screwed up in the end. I can't believe that they still do speaking engagements about investing--to me, they're the Milli Vanillies of the investment world!"
2,Scam?,I don't see anybody mentioning the recently revealed 'mistake' in Beardstown Ladies calculations. Their REAL annualized yield was not 23+ % but a much more modest 9 %. You could be better off with an S&P index fund
1,THE JIG IS UPPPPPPPPPPP,"so it turns out, after all, that as a fellow poster notes and a simple google search or wikipedia glance reveals: 'the increase in their returns was calculated including the club members' monthly dues (as stated on the book's ISBN page), thus vastly overstating their performance.' Ok so which part of SCAM do you need me to explain? ZERO stars if I could! For Shame you 'ladies'!"
1,Forget individual stocks,"Forget trying to beat the market. Most people can't do it over the long run, no matter how many hours of work you put into it. Instead just put your money in an S&P 500 or Total Stock Market index fund and forget it."
3,A good read despite the controversy.,"Despite controversy of the past, this is still a great down to earth book that will make you a better investor. One good idea can be worth big money. There are many good ideas and advice within the pages of this book. Especially well suited for those starting an investment club."
5,Recommended,"This books is recommended for people attracted to Babaji. By the way, I have at home copies of the three Indian editions included in this book - the review of Patricia makes no sense. You can even see that Amazon offers the original book - it was published in India (but Patricia says ""it was never published by Ramaiah""???). Yes, use discernment."
1,Text and Photos,The images in the book are very few and extremely amateurish in quality and appearance. Whether these are claiming to be genuine photos or the artists impressions is unclear from the accompanying captions. The text reads in a rather patronising manner and says nothing new. It would be a surprise to this reader if the book was at all genuine.
4,Not bad,"There are several tracks that are pretty damn good, as well as a few bummers. The William Orbit track is good, as well as some Norman Cook remixes. All in all I like this disc and would purchase it again from what I know. You might like it too."
4,Pretty Durn Goody,"I am impressed with this CD collection, from the techno Uberzone to house Fatboy Slim Remixes this is a great cd. The Cornershop remix by Fatboy Slim has a great beat to it and all the others are just as good. I really reccomend this cd."
4,Dana is hot!,I found out about Dana from the liner notes on Robbie Robertson's new cd. Her voice is outa this world.
5,Remarkably Refreshing,"Children will love The Remarkable Farkle McBride. The rythm is wonderful and the illustrations engaging. It is fun to read as an adult and therefore parents won't tire repeatedly reading it to their children, which they must do with favorite books."
5,Good Children's Lit Book for a Music Class,"I teach general music in an elementary school in Tennessee. I bought a copy of this book for myself and one for the other music teacher on the strength of a recommendation from a facilitator in a professional development workshop I attended in May.My team mate said she once had a copy of this book at another school she'd taught in but lost it, so she was thrilled to have it back in her classroom library. She said the story draws the students in and fires their imagination to ask questions all during the time she reads it aloud. She mentioned it is especially effective to engage the boys with----which speaks volumes about the value of this book!I plan to use it with 2-4th grades starting in the upcoming school year.I found the seller took a bit longer to ship the book than I'd wanted, but at least I had it in my hands before we let out for the summer!"
2,Disappointing,"Having taught music to young children for a number of years, I am always looking for new and interesting ways to get children interested in classical music. While the intent is good, I don't think the story is very well written. Also, this would've been perfect to have an accompanying CD so that kids can hear and relate to music and the instruments in a way that you just can't do through text and pictures alone."
5,Great Intoduction to the Orchestra for Kids!,"This book is a great introduction to the orchestra for kids! Lithow's rhymes are filled with wonderful sounds that mimic the noises of various instruments. I heard Mr. Lithgow on National Public Radio today and he talked about how children are sure to identify with frustrated Farkle as he tries to find his true calling--which is ultimately not to play any single instrument, but to be the conductor of the orchestra. What a terrific message about the power of collaboration! And don't miss out on the truly inspired paintings by illustrator C. F. Payne!"
1,gruesome & disappointing,This book was not up to Ann Benson standards. It was far too bloody & the the link between past & future was loose & contrived.
3,"For Jerry Colonna fans, a delight. Otherwise . . .","If you are looking for Jerry Colonna's fabulous dixieland/jazz trombone-playing, keep looking. This is not a dixieland record, but rather a very old (1940s) collection of digitally-restored novelty songs. Colonna sings (if that is the word for it) on every single track, and he sounds a lot more like Spike Jones than Caruso. If Amazon had had preview song clips available for this disc, I probably would not have purchased it. At under 45 minutes, it is not the most generous collection, either, but the disc's sound quality is better than you might think: no 78 RPM surface noise, scratches or pops. There are no liner notes, and there should be for archive material. Highlight of the disc: ""Down By The Old Mill Stream,"" which I think most clearly demonstrates that Jerry was and still is a lot of fun. And at least the song ""JA DA"" is a dixieland number."
2,Not as advertized!,"I bought 2 of these because the ad said they held 2 cups and I was looking for something that I could use as a cup and also heat a meal in.When I recieved them they looked small for the size so I checked out the volume. The cups only hold about 13-1/2 ounces and that's to overflowing NOT to a usable volume. A realistic volume would be somewhere around 12 ounces if you have a steady hand. The Couglans packaging said 2 cups/500ml which is flat out wrong (Shame on you Coughlans) especially when they qualify the volume in mls. having said this, the cup looked sturdy and would probably give good service if you are not looking for an actual 2 cup volume. My belief is that you should get what you ordered and paid for not somebody's guess or approximation. I have returned them and I'm still looking for a true 16 oz. sierra cup."
2,missrepresented,"All in all it is a good cup and I would be happy if I had got what I ordered. I ordered the 3x 500ml/2cup sierra cup and got 3 8oz/250ml cups with the ""Jumbo Sierra Cup"" stickers on the bottom. Personaly I think the the 8oz cup is to small to be practical."
1,Superficial,"Superficial, biased, gossipy. All in all, an unworthy book. For a good read on TR, the 2 volume set by Morris is excellent."
4,Draws sharp contrasts between the mighty Roosevelt branches.,"What Collier and Horowitz do in this book is weave a tale not of two seperate Roosevelt clans vying for political power, but of the succession of one branch into prominence following the decay of the other. The intriguing side-plots involving the two families reads like a royal family of America. FDR and Teddy are not the only Roosevelt's analyzed here, their children and their remarkable (and sometimes scandalous) lives are exposed as well. A well researched book that illuminates a historical American political dynasty"
3,Decent family fare,"Aside from the (unfortunately) typical gross humor, this movie provides good family fun. I saw it with my nine-year-old while my pre-teen was seeing something more mature. Racing Stripes is your typical sports/family underdog kind of movie. It's a feel-good, you-can-do-it kind of plot. OBVIOUSLY, the aim of the movie is NOT to accurately portray the horseracing industry--it's not about that! If you have realistic expectations, and the desire for decent family fare, go ahead and see Racing Stripes."
4,Racing Stripes,Haven't viewed the dvd yet since I am giving it to my daughter for Christmas but happy with quick delivery.
4,OK... but doesn't hold child's interest long,"Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of weeks it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.I would recommend this for young children and provides them with access to seeing farm animals. Good learning experience without the violence and negative concepts often portrayed in movies."
4,Very sweet movie,"This is a very sweet movie. Maybe a little predictable, but it's great for kids. I also loved the cute interaction between the animals and the adorable sound the zebra makes. Wonderful movie for a family with young children to sit and watch, or if you just need to see a film with a happy ending.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Sweet and entertaining.,"If you expect the reality of horseracing, (i.e. the enormous sums of cash, the rules and regs, the sport of kings) you won't want to see this movie. It does have lovely animals, but it is a fantasy, and as such, a very sweet one. The dialogue, esp. the human dialogue, is at times a bit over the top, and even the acting talent in this cast can't overcome the all too predictable script. Hence 4 stars.That said, I'm not a bit fan of reality; I get enough of it in everyday life. Sometimes a movie is what it is, and this one is a DELIGHTFUL and SWEET fantasy with a bit of bathroom humor and that ADORABLE zebra."
4,I thought it was cute,It is a kids movie but there are lines in there for the adults as well!! It's about a zebra who wants to race. A good story line considering what else is out there!!I do have to say though that I think there are some lines that are intended for adults that kids could pick up. If your child is someone that picks up things that they hear and repeat it just to repeat it...then I'm not so sure that it's a good movie for them though there is no profanity in it of course!
4,A whole lot better than expected....,"My 4 year old daughter had seen this already at the movies and absolutely loved it. So when we were at Wal-Mart the other day and she spotted the DVD for sale, she just had to have it. I watched it with her, not expecting much. Lo and behold, I found myself really liking this movie. Yes, it is formulaic, but that isn't neccessarily a bad thing if done well, as it is in this movie. Now, there is plenty corny parts about it, but there were enough genuine laughs in it to more than balance that out. But I have to say, the acting jobs by Bruce Greenwood and Hayden Pantierre were really good and convincing. There are a lot of genuinely bad kids movies out there, and I am happy to say that ""Racing Stripes"" is definitely NOT one of them."
5,Hilarious!!,"I absolutley LOVE this movie. I have already watched it four times and it never gets tiring. It is HILARIOUS! Personally, I think the flies make the movie. lol. They are so funny. This movie also has a great heartfelt storyline. What more could you ask for?! You don't even have to have kids to enjoy this one but it is a great family movie."
3,"Cute! Not Perfect, but OK!!","I wasn't sure what experience would prevail, a warm and fuzzy one or a total nightmare. Basically, this movie was in-between. The script is uneven. The formula is no different than in other family films and you know that there has to be a happy ending so it's been done before. However, the movie does have it's moments. The voices of Steve Harvey & David Spade as the flies really saved this movie as I found them entertaining. I had the chance to see this movie with my three little cousins, ages 9, 5 & 3 and they loved it. Your kids will love it as well. It is cute, but not perfect."
1,Didn't work,Santa bought this for my daughter and it was a big disappointment because it didn't work. The movie it's self is great!!! My four year old who loves horses really likes it.
2,Certainly wholesome but.............,My seven year old boy didn't even make it to the end. He walked out of the theatre. Boring.
3,"Typical, typical, o!! So Typical","Childrens fare seems to be in full force these days. I can remember when kid films were rare and financial failures. This one really didn't catch on and I think its because its a little too juvenile for todays market. Shrek, Shark Tale, Nemo et al also remebered that there were adults in the audienace. That is a good thing. Also, there wasn't much of a toy backing this movie. No cross-merchandising. This is a bad thing if you want a big blockbuster. Still, it will keep your kids quiet for 90 minutes, and they will want to eatch it over and over and over...all in all its still a good value."
1,Boring,"the sad thing about this film is that I dig many of the folks involved with it,but this film just wasn't funny to me&just rode off so many cliches that it wasn't funny.I was yawning within the first 20 minutes of this film which wasn't good."
1,Pathetic- straight from the horses mouth,"a talking zebra, talking flies, frankie Muniz as one of many voice overs, and a way-to-lengthy time frequence..this really takes the cake, as one of the worst films i have ever seen! this isn't even a family movie! toddlers in the session i went to were even fast asleep, and when a kid naps through a movie with talking animals and big imagery annimation..you know its bad! 1 star is generous, specially for this trash, i havent been this bored since the dreadful Catwoman, even hallie berry in a tight cat suit couldn't save that film!. that is the same as the animated flies from racing stripes, which im presuming the director was hoping would become a cult amimated character like woody from toy story and the incredibly cute puss in boots from shrek..well was he wrong! viewers heres some advice... bake a casserole for 100mins, its far more furfiling than this film. The whole racing stripes couldn't get any worse..unless of course, if there is a follow up!!!!!!"
1,Hate To Do It...,"...But I will. Retarded movie. Need I say more?For the REAL Horse Racer fan:NATIONAL VELVETRUFFIAN:BURNING FROM THE START (saddest but best book ever!)FUNNY CIDESECRETARIATMAN O' WARSEABISCUITsearch these items and see what other people said about them. If you like this thing better, I'm sorry you feel that way. But at least give reality a try, will you?"
3,cute for kids!,"fairly enjoyable movie, especially for kids. adults and horse lovers will have a harder time though as there are many unrealistic moments in it. but kids will absolutely love this film!"
4,fun family film,"This is a fun film for even very young kids..Teaches kids..life has setbacks but hard work and determination pays off. also you can make good friends along the way,"
3,a Kid's review,"It's a nice movie when the animals don't talk, the zebra is cute in it but when he talks then he is a little bit childish. The flys are annoying in it, the goat has annoying voice and is childish. A horse named Sandy is the only one who isn't childish, and the pelican is really disturbing in the movie. The whole film was good but the way they were talking was a bit annoying."
3,Iv'e only seen the trailers for it.,"It looks great. When David spade Sings Old Mcdonald is just hilloureous. 3 stars since it hasent come it. 2 days after I see it I tell you how like it, OK? Thanks.Sighned Doug"
5,Probably Just For Fans,"This CD is a must have for almost every Tatu fan Actually I don't like electronic music, but it was very different when I heard this. I enjoyed it a lot because it is based of course on Tatu's music and it has a very solid structure with the best remixes of the songs ""All the Things She Said"" and ""Not Gonna Get Us"" also a remix of ""30 Minutes"" in this CD. Probably for some fans there is some kind of disadvantage because in another Remixes from Japan, it has the DJ Monk remix of ""All the Things She Said"" and this CD has the blackpulke as a substitution of the first track on the Japan CD which is the DJ's monk remix. The ""Not Gonna Get Us Remix Video"" is the same video as ""Not Gonna Get Us"" but only different in the chronological order and some other stuff. So if you are a Tatu fan, you must have this CD, even if you dont like electronic music you'll like this. Try it."
5,Pleasingly Soulful,"What a great way to start any session! Soulful stirrings of yester-year. Love inspiring songs geared to the ears of true connoisseurs of excellent music! What a musical treat for us old school folks! If your're looking for smooth, silky stylistic impressions, look no further. Put this on, sit back and visualize!"
3,Good CD which could have been better,"This 1991 CD contains four tracks written and produced by Van Morrison, among them the title track is my fave one; Terry Britten , Graham Lyle and Albert Hammond provide some uptempo songs; ""Do I Ever cross Your Mind"" is a beautiful ballad as well as one of the highlights of the album ""Couldn't Say Goodbye"" written by Albert Hammond and the nearly always reliable Diane Warren, who during late 80s and early 90s was in one of her peak periods as a hitmaker. There are some songs that could have been replaced by better choices, the rest is good material for the powerful voice of Tom Jones, one of the living legends of Rock'n'roll."
2,Makeup,This product did not fullfill what they said. They said they were going to a couple models but they only did one. The information is short. Very dissapointed
3,Exciting? Well.........,"I'm not quite sure why this band has such a daft & misleading moniker: if you're looking for power-trio excitement this is definitely the wrong disc, but it's a nice cooled-out trio disc in the area somewhere between alt-jazz & alt-rock that seems to be a Chicago speciality. The vibe's rather similar to Jeff Parker's _Like-Coping_, though it has a different flavour due to the comparative downplaying of the guitar (if anything the bass & drums are more upfront here) & tendency of the music to get into strange droney areas even on the more energetic tracks. It's all wonderfully moody & atmospheric but I'm not sure it adds up to all that much more, & the final 14-minute piece with a prominent part for melodica is pushing it. Pretty music, though not terribly demanding."
2,A better subtitle would be understanding children's books,"I get paid for writing reviews of children's books. Most of the books that I'm asked to review are art instruction books or picture books because I also am a freelance artist. I thought that I should read this book to make sure that I hadn't missed anything. However, the title is misleading. It is not really a book about ""Evaluating and Reviewing Children's Books"". A better title would be understanding children's books. Only the last chapter in the book deals with reviewing children's books and that is the shortest chapter. Most of the book is comprised of a comprehensive overview of the different categories of children's books (non-fiction, poetry, picture, easy readers, transitional and fiction). If I had the opportunity to browse through this book in a regular bookstore, it would have stayed on the shelf."
3,Too Much Summary,"I really wanted to enjoy this book more than I did, because I have a great deal of respect for the author's knowledge of her subject matter. However, I was disappointed because so much of what she has to say seems to be a summary of basic knowledge about children's books. My main problem with this book is that I don't know who the audience is. Do people who want to know how to evaluate children's books really need to be told what alliteration, assonance, and consonance are in the chapter on poetry, for example? As I read this book, I did not feel that the author was addressing me in any way: I don't know who she was addressing. Writers? Parents? Professors of children's literature? College students? Librarians? I was disappointed."
3,Not the same intensity as the previous four compilations,"I wonder if this will be the last of the series! Once you place this CD on the player you will begin to wonder where has all the intensity of the other four compilations gone...!Unlike the previous works in the series, this one is to be played way after a dinner party...the energy is not the same and it makes you yawn at times. I picked it up this afternoon at a local records store expecting much more than this...Instead, buy the second installment of the Bajofondo Tango Club."
3,One of two that don't quite hit the mark,"I adore this series!!! Unfortunately this one hasn't got the ""oh my goodness"" factor. It's okay, but I don't feel it has any outstanding songs on it. A stunning, superb series other than this CD and the very first one, so don't be put off the rest of them. They are world class and extraordinary. This is a good filler, but nothing more."
2,Tired Covers,"Take a great song, slow it down slightly, take out some of the original mix including harmony vocals, and this is what you got. If you are looking to hear the songs you love the way they were originally laid down, this is not it. Go for the re-mastered project. Sorry guys, but when the Allman Brothers gave us ""Whipping Post"" for the 4th time, it was live, creative and innovative--newly nuanced. This is not the case with this recording....but I still love you."
5,Something to dream about,"If you're thinking about building a timber frame home, get this book for inspiration. It's a portfolio of thirty-two of the remarkable homes built by Tony Hanslin's company, Yankee Barn Homes. Each is presented in beautiful color photographs and with floor plans. You'll get ideas for details, finishes, furnishing, decorating and landscaping your new home. You'll learn about the flexibility and durability of this ancient method of construction, and you'll see the great, barn-like soaring spaces that can only be built with timber frames. Timber frame homes are more expensive than most, but this book is a bargain, and dreams are free!"
5,Book,"Book was very good. My child doesnt like to read but somehow loved this book, so now I have a means to get him to enjoy reading."
5,Great episode and a sure to be great book,"I've never read this book, but I've seen the episode and this book is sure to be a great one. I'll try to go and buy this book sometime."
5,great show!!!!,this show is great ! please make this a book serise ! and make it to where people can buy it !
4,The lure of the White Witch....,"This is the book, based on the life of a real woman, that fanned my first real interest in Jamaican history. Full of the contradictions of Jamaican 19th century life. A standard of Jamaican story telling that sets the scene of Jamaican plantation life in an elegantly dark way, just as the island was 'elegantly dark' in all it's blazing heat, beauty and the looming dangers of slave/master liaison and rebellion. My role in the dance production based on this book was the greatest of my dance career and I could 'feel the book' during every performance.The Brown Phoenix: An Erotic Dialogue from The IndiesShub Down & Small-up Yuself! Diaries of Jamaica by Bus"
4,expensive text,"Clearly-written and accessible to undergraduates, without a lot of the dumbed-down, feel-good blather that mars so many textbooks. The text appears to be suffering from mission creep -- new editions are getting bigger, heavier, and more expensive. Asking students to pay $80 for a paperback is ridiculous; their money would be better spent purchasing copies of The Prince, Lenin's Tomb, Gideon's Trumpet, and Reading Lolita in Tehran. - Chad Raymond, Assistant Professor of Political Science, Gardner-Webb University"
1,not impressed!,"I'm not impressed by this cd,I've heard better,There might be 2 or 3 songs even half way decent to be listening to. The boys voices are so high they sound like little girls,I mean maybe it's just the main singer I hear,but he doesn't sound that good,they sound too high to be in a boy band.I can say that a couple of the guys are cute,and that might make some girls buy the cd and think its the greatest cd ever...but its not."
1,They need to stay in school.,Im a big fan of pop music but this isnt a pop group.this is more of a bunch of guys thrown together by someone who just wants to manage a group.this group makes other groups look bad like Dream and Aaron Carter.these two have real talent.this group called Dream Street is just a bunch of [wish they were] singers.they dont even sound good.they need to just get out of the business now.by giving them the name Dream Street they make the group Dream sound bad because they have just about the same name.so to anyone thinking of buying this cd DONT you'll regret it.i went to a used music store so i could hear it before i got it and im glad i didnt buy it first because i would have took it back.all this cd is good for is to throw in the air ...
1,I really don't know,"What is there to say. This is garbage. They wear makeup. They sound like ancient Greek ""castradas."" The song, ""It happens everytime,"" is absolutely hilarious. I would believe I'm listening to the Spice girls. This music is fine for pre-teen girls, but no one over the age of 12 should think this is actually terrific music. Please, at least upgrade to pop artists who have completed 7th grade."
3,Disappionted,I was very sad that these VERY hot guys couldn't pick better songs to sing i think that with different songs i would have bout it but it just wasn't as good as their looks.:-(
5,Great CD,"The ""dreamstreet"" CD by dream street is awesome. I would buy the CD even though i don't like dream street that much."
2,cool,"I think it was alright,the songs were cool but this could be just another boyband getting success from their looks.personally my favorite song is it happens every time because it gets stuck in your mind.this is just my opinion you don't have to agree but overall it was good."
1,Don't Buy This CD,I got this Cd after It happens everytime but I was wrong I thought this was going to Be a good Cd
1,This record disgusts me,This is pathetic all of the members are pathetic. The fact that people like this crap is pathetic. Go listen to some heavy metal nu-metal or goth rock its alot better then this bull*hit
4,Chris is the Best,"NO!!!! This isn't just another boy band!!! These boys are really talented! I listened to their whole CD and the music is very mellow and soothing, their voices mend well with the melodies, I loved it (especially when Chris was singing! No offense to the rest of the members, y'all are great but there's just something about Chris that catches and holds on to my attention)! Yeah, so..um..yeah, buy it because I said so! I am just playin, buy it if you're into mellow and soothing music! Ok, so...yeah (no I am not a ditz I just wanna keep typing)That's all I have to say about that!P.S.---See the movies ""On the Line"" ""K-Pax"" (totally hott guy in that movie) ""Domestic Disturbance"" (some semi-hottie in there and I ain't talking about John Travolta or Vince Vaughn, I'm talking about the boy who played 'Danny') and rent ""Mallrats"" (I know, I watch alot of movies! so sue me alright! Just kidding about sueing, I have no money so don't! I hope to see the DreamStreet hotties in a movie soon!!!)!"
5,Dreamstreet Rules!,I love this CD! I don't really have one favorite song on it though. I love Dreamstreet. My best friend and I met them at the mall. They were funny. They signed my best friend's and my CDs. My best friend got all of them to sign her CD. I only got Matt and Jesse (my favorite) to sign mine. I got my picture taken with Jesse. My best friend and I made a sign that said We Love Jesse and made him blush! I have a picture of that. Jesse said nothing to the other girls but he said that he liked my jacket to me. I am sad that they broke up. Some of them are going solo though. I would reccomend this CD to any Dreamstreet fan. Also I would reccomend their album The Biggest fan which is the sound track to the movie The Biggest fan.
2,Could be better... much better...,"Now, don't take offence here, but this album did nothing for me. The songs all sounded more or less alike; the band didn't branch out into other styles of singing. Also, truth be told, they do sound like girls. I'm not saying this to insult them. It's just the way it is. The album was full of meaningless pop songs - I doubt if Dream Street actually wrote their own songs (don't hold me to that, though). One thing I will give them though: I've read that all or most of them had Broadway backgrounds before they started singing in a band. So, hey, at least they really can sing. All in all, Dream Street is just another boy band with catchy songs that are bound to get stuck in your head. However, I think pre-teens who are just getting into the music scene might enjoy this CD and will also like the band members, who are still in high school. Otherwise, I'd advise you to look elsewhere for good music."
1,um.,"Music? Maybe. But good music? I think not. Just another [...], the-same boy band all over again, except even worse than before. Talentless, young, and naive, ""Dream Street"" comes out into the music world looking for fans? Well, I doubt they're really going to get anywhere in this world if they keep on making THIS kind of manufactured pop music."
2,hahahaha!,"Holy f--- .. I honestly hope this is a joke.. just when boybands/pop music couldn't get any worse, this comes along. Honestly now.. If you're thinking of getting this, please, support artists who actually write their own music.. and no, I don't mean limp dizzick :-)Even if that music does something for you, there's better pop/boyba.. oh wait, there isn't.. ah well, try listening to something more original i suppose :-)"
1,Kid Tales,"I was at a record store getting this cd for my little sisters 10th bday and I was looking all over the pop and new releases and couldnt find it anywhere, so I asked a guy that worked there and he led me over to the corner where they keep Disney sing alongs and Kidz bop! And Dream Street was right in there with em! I laughed at myself for buying a cd from that section, but its funny, cuz thats exactly where it belongs! This group is very kiddiesh and the music is annoying as ever!"
2,HA HA HA HA,So i played this CD cuz my friends and i were bored and needed something to do and i had no clue who these people were. And we laughed...and laughed...and laughed. it was funny listening to guys who could sing higher notes then anyone i know (meaning girls that i know {and trust me they're hard to beat}). we imagined laughing them off the stage in a concert cuz it would be just so funny to see 13-14y/o strutting around a stage with strobe lights and singing as high as they do. The whole CD had us laughing for awhile after it ended.
1,I hate em.,"When I first heard ""It Happens Everytime"" I said to myself. ""What the heck was that?"" Boys or Girls? In my opinion girls. This cd is the biggest waste of time. I hope they all lose their record deals. That would be the best thing in the world. How the heck did these girls get a record deal? Anyway...don't get this cd. I repeat. Do not get this cd. If you know whats good for you, you will let this group rot."
2,WARNING: QUESTIONABLE LYRICS,"This group sounds good. Their music is upbeat and nice. The problem I have with them is their song lyrics. My children (4&7) love Aaron Carter, BSB, and NSYNC. They heard this music on TV and HAD to have it. So, we got it. Some of the songs are OK, but most seem to have lyrics which distinctly and clearly imply encounters of a sexual nature and so are not appropriate for my young children. It's disturbing to listen to a voice which sounds 8 or 10 years old singing these lyrics. I had to ""lose"" the CD as I was just not comfortable with my children listening to and learning these lyrics. So, parents out there, beware!!! Check this out before spending your money."
1,Funny,"For those of you that have this cd-really listen to it and laugh, because thats exactly what you should do. I made the mistake of falling for the catchy pop sound and pretty-boy appeal too, but when you really take the time to really listen, its quite funny. Real bands, and yes, even the boy bands are so much better, theres a huge maturity gap. Turn on the radio and compare that to this..get my point??"
3,Gosh...NO,"i DO have this ANNOYING CD and am not exactly fond of it. I do like I say Yeah and Dream on and like one more, but COME ON! These guys LOOK and SEEM snotty. Especially Chris. Maybe i'm being a bit harsh, but TAKE A HINT.!!:% Plus, even though i got it pretty cheap and TARGET it wasn't barely even HALF worth it. It's kind of hard to explain. If you're going to get it, get it USED!!"
5,THE HOTTEST AND MOST TALENTED GUYS IN THE WHOLE WORLD!,"WOW! How do i start to tell you how much i LOVE Dream Street! They are cute, talented, and dedicated! Each song is unique, and each boy get's his own song. They are the perfect combination for each other, each of them talented in their own ways. One cannot appreciate them fully until they see their DVD video as well! They don't lip sync and their dance moves ROCK! They may seem young, but they've got it goin on!!! You'll be hooked the minute you listen to their first song. They are catchy, fun, and meaningful. My life is Dream Street. I wake up in the morning just for them! THEY ARE SO HOT! And once you actually become a obsessive fan (like me) and you research the guys, you'll see how talented they really are. Jesse McCartney, Chris Trousdale, Greg Raposo, Frankie Galasso, and Matt Ballinger--IM GONNA MARRY YOU GUYS!!!!!! Thanks for forever changing my life!"
1,... MANUFACTURED POP COMIN' RIGHT UP!,"This has to be the worst album I have ever listened to in my entire life. I am a pop fan (I like BSB; some of Britney, 'N SYNC, Mandy and Christina, I'll admit that much) myself, but this boyband is just full of tasteless music. Their vocals may harmonize, but the music is horrible. One star out of five for having good vocals, but the rest goes down the drain. And the cover? Look familiar? Yeah, the BSB also did a pic exactly like that back in 1998/99. Go home, Dream Street, and find yourself better oppurtunities in the music industry."
5,dream street review,i absolutely love this cd and if you are a pop music lover i encourage you to get this cd! some people are ashamed to say that they like dream street but if i had the chance id shout it from the rooftops...I LOVE DREAM STREET! they actually fit into the category of a boy band (even though i wouldnt put them in that category) because they are between 15 and 17 years old. and even though they are young you can tell that they have been going at it for a long time. they sound like they know what they are doing! this cd came out when they were younger so their voices are a little high...but their new cd is supposed to be coming out soon and i just cant wait! if you dont like this one...wait around till their next one because im sure it will be awesome!
3,It's ok..,"I think Dream Street's voices are better than Backstreet Boy's or NSYNC, but the songs are similar-some reasonobly catchy ones, some banal balads. The cover of the A*Teens song Sugar Rush is rather weak-it's slower and with less energy(Try listening to the A*Teens version).If you are a 10 year old girl, you might love this album, but I don't think there is annything special about it."
1,This is music?,"I took my 10-year-old cousins to the Aaron Carter concert a while back and these guys were the openers. Totally unremarkable, honestly. I don't see what differentiates this group (no, they're not a band...they're a group) from the plethora of others on the pop scene. If you're going to listen to this stuff, at least stick with *NSYNC or Backstreet. Heck, try out some Blink-182 or something. This stuff isn't even worth your time."
1,Oh my god!,"I can't beleive this CD! They sound like a bunch of girls! I just listened to the 30 seconds of ""Let's Get Funky Tonite""...LOL That was just hularious! I so do not recomend this CD to anyone w/ a pulse!"
4,Dreamstreet's talent shows through,"There is quite a lot of talent shone through in this group. Some are able to say they have been involved in broadway shows, all were in commercials, and each one individully has appered on sitcoms such as the Rosie O'Donell Show, David Letterman, Conan O'Brian, Jay Leno, and Saturay Night Live. There is no question that the harmonies within these 5 guys meets at the perfect range to produce wonderful music. I can not stress enough the fact that they put their every free moment in to working with one another . If not practicing and performing, then they give to charity. This cd gets 5 stars because each song is diffeen and unique."" I just want Someone to Hold Me Tonight"" is by far my favorite.The cd incudes some songs early on to get you revved up and some to mellow you out. It is a great combinaion of singers who are on their way to stardom!-+ (by the way, I am in love with Jesse!)"
3,Dream Street,"Well, its good if you're actually into that pop stuff...and they are really hot but if you're not a fan of pop music then I wouldn't suggest buying it. When I first got it I thought it was the best thing but I got sick of it within 2 weeks. So its a matter of taste I guess. BUT THEY ARE HOTT! lol"
3,"Any reason Jesse went solo? Chirpy, squeaky singing here!","I have heard a few songs from Dream Street's debut. And while they were 11, 12 and 13 then, they sound so chirpy and squeaky on the vocals. It's very obvious on It Happens Every Time, which sounds like any Max Martin production for those boy bands. Happens has such an infectious and catchy pop sound that doesn't get out of your head. And keep in mind that this group had a young Jesse McCartney, who's had strong success lately with his nearly year-old Beautiful Soul album. Any reason Jesse went solo? Because Jesse wouldn't even be singing this stuff that sounds like Joey McIntyre's former falsetto voice in NKOTB speeded up to 78 on the record player. Just consider yourself warned when you hear this album."
1,I hate kids.,"Yo, this A.J. here, I hate Dream Street! They a buncha li'l kids put in da spotlight by their managers and arent' probly off trainin' weels yet. Go get a life, you Dream Street lovas!!!!"
2,Weird,"I really don't know about this one. another boy band, yes, but they do have courage to go up and sing these songs, which aren't too bad, really. Yeah they do sound a little like little kids. I think if they came out with a good hip hop or rap song, they would sound better and would be better."
1,The worst pop group,"Im a pop lover, but this group is......the worst group ever. Have you heard their voices? They are like Nick Carter's voice with 25% more speed. They sound like girls. They are vomitive. This cd must be censored!!!!!"
1,why?,"After reading some of the reviews for this cd I can't help but wonder what cd you are talking about. You actually liked this cd? Why? The melodies all sound the same, the lyrics are corny, and the guys have horrible voices. Their voices are so high pitched that they sound like girls. If you are over the age of ten, don't buy this cd. There are much better things you could do with your money."
1,This is a HORRILBLE CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dream Street is no different than The backstreet boys!!!! There singing..., and there way 2 small to be singing. I bought this C.d thinking ""Hey what the heck, lots of people said this c.d was good.....YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!! As far as I'm concerned, those producers need 2 get there head put on right!"
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE INSANE!,"How can you people like this crap? It's so stupid! Everybody who likes Dream Street has NO taste in music and must be deaf. This CD made my ears bleed. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap because it's not worth it. Anybody who thinks Dream Street is good, must be really despreate for good music! This is coming from someone who likes pop music and who has good taste. I wish I could rate this CD negative stars! PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S WORTHLESS! I know good music, and Dream Street is NOT good music. Why do you think they broke up? Dream Street is made up of a bunch of idiots with no talent. If you want real pop, buy Hilary Duff. Even Aaron Carter is better than this, and he sucks!~NiCoLe~"
1,they sound like girls,ok i listened to some of these guys songs and they sound like 5 girls singing. They should wait until their voices change before they try to sing
1,one word... TERRIBLE,"okay now, who the hell do they think they r huh? the album stinks and they r just...wat can i say? ugly! I don't even know their names that clearly, no need to remember it! b/c they r not worth it! now lets take another look. they actually try to be bsb or nsync? c'mon give me a break! I don't care about nstinc. but as u know, bsb is the best of pop! some gurls even say that they'll be the next bsb...pul-leese! tell ur dream street boys to wait another 10 years!then maybe there'll be a little possibility to succeed! dream street r only for gurls under 13. well, I'm 13, and I'm a pop fan, but I hate dreamstreet!please, gurls, do urself a favor, go listen to some better bands such as bsb(my fave ever!),nsync,good charlotte, linkin park, evanescence etc. i'm tellin u, it's not worth it. i'm sure that dream street will be gone b4 u know it!"
1,Dreamstreetisnogood,"They stink and they are bubble gum pop! None of them have talent! I mean some of there songs. There voices haven't changed. THey sing sooooo high. They make glass crack. If you want a good cd buy Nelly Furtado's Whoa Nelly! So forget about Dreamstreet, you will just be dissapionted."
1,I dont like it,"Whats with the kid who spikes his hair all the time? Does he think thats hott or something? None of these boys are hott. I saw them on this show called Go For It and they are such posers, they didnt even sing. They just stood up there and lip synced, and yes they were, they didnt even have microphones! The music is more for girls under 13."
2,Kinda Disapointed!!,"I was kind of dissapointed with this cd. They sound like little kids, but I can't blame them, because they were my age when they made that cd. The only song I likes was Gotta Get The Girl because Jesse is the only one I like. People respect his vocals. He can get his voice high or low or right in the middle, whenever the song needs it. He did sort of sound like a girl, but he sounds best on the DisneyMania 2 cd. I don't think they should of been Dream Street when they were at that age, they should've at the age of 15 at the most."
5,dreamstreets the best go jesse,"this cd may make some people think hey i cant listen to this it's not this years style.but this is one of the best cds i have heard in a long time.and jesse sounds so cute as a kid!buy this if you like bubblegum pop.by the way it doesnt really sound like songs aaron carter would sing to all the haters out there.personally i'm a big fan of aaron,jesse and dreamstreet also billy gilman!"
3,Definatly good!,"First this is his daughter!I wasn't a fan of dream street when they were officially around , but you know what i am now. Because the sing with such passion and in old concerts you see they have such enthusiasm and spark. Its a bonus that they all are fine and jesse mccartney really hits high notes well. This album is fanastic i listen to it on blast at home in the uk. I am stil waiting to be able to purchase their dvd as they are so charming and sexy when they perform !frm alex 14"
4,Don't be so harsh.,"I really think that all of you who say this isn't music need a serious attitude. I understand if you don't like this kind of music; that's cool. But enjoying boy band music does not make a person a horrible judge of music. I loved Dream Street and now Jesse McCartney, but I also love Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons."" You cannot judge whether something is good or bad music. If you don't like it, leave it for those who enjoy it. They were around 11, 12, 13? I think for that age they did an amazing job dealing with the singing and the issues that come with even short-term celebrity. Take it or leave it, but give them credit and some respect for trying something that most of us are too afraid to even contemplate."
1,EW.,"What has the world come to? Why are these little kids aloud to make horrible music like this....? Anyway, all this is just a horrible Backstreet Boys clone which is really saying something considering the Backstreet Boys weren't even any good. Not to mention I haven't heard anything from the Backstreet Boys OR Dream Street in quite awhile. Point is stay far FAR away from this and any other music that resembles this. Instead try this cd: Walk Among Us by The Misfits. Might take some getting used to if you're accustomed to this crap, but trust me you'll be glad you made the switch."
3,"Great Songs, just the voices that scare.","Ok, first off. I'm not a Dream Street hater. Infact I like them. But just the cd that scares.Im really giving it 3 and a half stars out of 5;.My favorite song would be ""Dream On"" sang by Frankie Galasso.But don't listen to me!, try it out for yourself:)"
1,Nightmare on elm street!,"This is the worst c.d i have ever heard. These guys have no talent. Aaron Carter's song 'Oh Aaron' deserves a grammy in comparison with 'Feel the Rain'. I love pop believe me, i own albums by Dream, 98 degrees, Jessica Simpson and lyte funky ones. Listen to the online samples and judge for yourself.I would have given it 0 stars had it been possible."
1,This Deserves No Stars,"I saw a commercial for this ""band"" as I was watching Conan O'Brien, and I thought that it was part of a comedy sketch on the show. Then I came to the realization that this was a real commercial for an actual cd. I'm torn between laughter and anger whenever I see this cd. Seeing this makes the Backstreet Boys look like hard working and talented musicians. It makes me sick to think that the record industry will pay money to support garbage like this, when talented musicians can't even get a record contract."
2,They'll be good when their voices change!,"I listened to some of the songs on this album, and at first I thought I heard girls singing! The vocals were pretty good, but it sounded WAY too much like the girls in the 5th grade chorus way back when!(by the way i'm 13 not 12,... ^_^) Many of the songs are bubblegummy and are only the kind of stuff little teenyboppers would listen to. Yes, I am 13 and I listen to some pop music, but not no-talent kids entertainers who are like, 13 and fourteen! This stuff's so squeaky clean i bet they used clorox on all the cd's! If you like pop or pop rock, listen to someone with talent such as o-town, bsb, michelle branch, etc...."
2,it's okay,"The album is alright, but far from the best. The guys have tallent and maybe in a few years (after their voices break) they'll be worth something. But as for now, I'd personally stick to the older pop groups who are old enough to understand what they're singing about."
2,thiS iS a graet CD!!!,"I think this cd is great just like Billy gilman. Feel the Rain is stupendous. Jennifer Goodbye is positively obstinate, while Dream on is a vernacular conclusion to the album!"
2,At least they are boys,I got a headache after listening to 5 seconds of their first song. How many more boy bands are their going to be? At least they are boys. But if it's the 15 year old girls that are listening to the 25 year old men of BSB and N'SYNC how old are the girls listening to Dream Street?
5,Not a bad cd,"All those people who wrote negative things of this dream street cd and complain that they talk about love and sound like ""chimpmunks"" or whetever have to understand that they 11-13 year old boys and thats how they sound and think,ok.And besides this is a good cd its fantastic!!!!!!!!!!Sincerly,A good girl 0 : )"
5,Dreamstreet is so Dreamy,I know there are some bad comments about this CD.But just ignore that junk.How could you not love all the boy's voices and the sweet song lyrics they sing? Here's my thoughts of the songs.1. Feel the Rain 10/10 A really sweet song about getting back together.2. They Don't Understand 10/10 One of my favorites.3. It Happens Everytime 10/10 The first Dreamstreet song I heard.4. Gotta Get the Girl 6/10 Not one of my favorites but still a good song.5. Suger Rush 10/10 This is my favorite song on this CD6. Jennifer Goodbye 10/10 My heart melts whenever I hear this song.7. I say Yeah 10/10 A fun song to chill out with8. Matter of Time 8/10 A really good song9. Let's Get Funky Tonite 8/10 Not one of my favorites10. This Time 8/10 Really sweet11. Someone to Hold Me Tonight 9/10 I Love Chris on this12. Dream On 10/10 Go Frankie!!!!!!!
1,Total trash!,"I really hate thi- oh wait, nevermind.. I'm just going to leave this one alone... it's too easy..."
1,Your kidding...right?,"The content on this compact disc [copies] pop formations only modified in a younger form, which lacks enjoyability and anything with the synonym of that previous adjective...in other words, I could make better music by bashing my head against the toilet seat. ...!"
3,"Great Guys, OK CD","I recently met Dream Street at a local mall of mine, and honestly the only reason I went was to take my friends little sister. The music didn't intrest me at all, I just figured they were a few guys I could check out. They totally were awesome guys, except Chris who had his had in the clouds... Greg was very down to earth, and the other 3 (i forget their names) were just kind of there. After listening to the same songs over and over again inside the store, they started to grow on me though. So I went home, and downloaded their CD and did like the songs. It isn't the best CD in the whole world, but if you're looking for fun, up-beat, teeny-bopper, pop, this is definitly it! 5 guys who actual fit the profile of a BOY band, they are all under the ages of 17, just singing about love and what not. It's great for any BSB or NSYNC fan looking to dive into a new interest. I'd defnitly reccomend their music, however, if you have a chance to see them in person, GO MEET THEM!"
5,They are the best!,"OMG!!! these guys are sooo good! those of you who put they r bad are wrong! they are so good, adn they r so hott!"
1,Why? Why? Why? Why?,The fact that this group even exists makes me wonder how dead the music industry is. This is just like all the other boy groups out there. THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME!
2,Nothing Unique,"I have to admit these guys have talent, but unfortunately it is wasted. I like a couple of the songs, but they've fallen into the same trap as all the other boy groups and young vocalists of today...their songs are virtually interchangable! There is nothing unique in their style to set them apart from N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter and (God help us) Britney Spears.This style is getting extremely monotonous and with luck I think the public will tire of it very soon. Additionally, virtually every song on this CD is an insipid or sappy love song. But thank heavens there's no rap!So c'mon guys! You've got TALENT, use it to create something new and unique! Forget BSB, N'Sync and especially Britney and do something new. I wish you the best of luck and I mean that sincerely. Just be yourselves! We don't need any more of the same old same old!"
1,A boy band made up of kids........right.,"This needs to stop. We can't have little kids becoming ""bands"" anymore. It's horrible. I don't even own this CD and I know it is horrible. What could be worse than a bunch of kids who havn't hit puberty yet singing? Nothing."
2,Totally Underaged Singers,"These amateurs ...! They can't sing, and they think twirling around is dancing. (They're not Christi Yamaguchi.) I mean, their songs are like ""dude, dude, yayayayaya! oh girl woooo!"" Heck, they're worse than Lil' Bow Wow, who has music videos featuring hot girls in their panties....rubbing him! And they wear their sun-glasses 24/7! Geesh, you'd think they'd wait til' they actually sounded half-way decent! If you were waiting for something new, you found it! Boys that act like girls! DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF YOU HAVE ANY SANITY!"
1,i hate dream street,"god, help us. first britney, now this?? they r so untalented and r so ugly. they sound like 5 year olds. i would give them a 0 star if i could. how could u listen to this? spend ur money on like christina aguilera, alien ant farm, lifehouse, linkin park or something like that."
1,ZERO STARS.......HOW DID THEY GET HERE?? ALIENS?,"Okay, this is NOT (underline underline) a BOY GROUP! They are whiny, the human ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS! I mean, NSYNC is Boy Group! A BOY GROUP doesn't have to play their own instruments.. I don't even own the CD and still I can tell it's bad. I heard ""It Happens Every Time"" on the radio and... whoo...I thought my radio was broken or had a virus or something. And I thought Aaron Carter was bad..."
2,Nascar Pinball,Being a pinball fanatic I found this one of little challenge. The same movements for the ball over and over again. Very limited. Maybe interesting to a small child for a limited time. Could not hold your interest for any extended time period.
3,Looks good but not good to your clothes,"This pad looks nice and soft, but my sister has been having problems with this little pad. Most of the time when she wears certain kinds of clothes, the velcro will hook to her clothes' surface and pull out threads or fillament from it. So becareful when you wear something silky while using this shoulder pad."
1,"Lies, lies, and more lies. Horrible book","This just goes to show people the fact that anyone can publish anything. This book is full of false information and is used to help this author's agenda (Distributing seeds of invasive species). Check the literature cited, and you will see that the author uses the citations incorrectly and cites scientific research that states the exact opposite of what his views are. Any other invasion biology or invasion ecology book is far better."
4,"A beautiful book, but slightly lacking","I have been an admirer of the work of the Rural Studio from the start and couldn't wait to get this book... The photos are beautiful and touching, but the book is lacking in drawings (i.e. plans) and text. I was hoping for more about the thoughts and processes that students put into the designs, the role of Sam Mockbee in it all, and some architectural drawings that would more comprehensively showcase the projects"
3,"Excellent photos and stories, documentation is lacking","I loved reading the back story behind the Rural Studio projects, and the photos are great, but I would have liked to see more drawings even if they were just rough sketches."
2,Is this book really about architecture?,"I cannot fault any book about Mockbee's inspired work too much, but when I bought this I was expecting to learn about the architecture in greater detail. Instead this book is mostly a profile of the homes' recipients. With some exceptions, the photos demonstrate how the new projects are destined to quickly become shacks just like those they replaced because the owners can't or won't take care of their new homes. So much for well-meaning gifts of social housing..."
3,The roof over Hell is shingled with good intentions,"An uncritical text by the man's supporters, never addressing the incongruity of high-style homes with broken washing machines on the porches, never asking whether there's something inherently wrong with imposing your sense of style on others."
2,Rural Studio,Basically replacing traditional shacks with better ones using inexpensive materials...Nothing particularly elegant or innovative...good intentions though...
3,"Good, But Gameplay Sucks!","This game has a great storyline, graphics, and lots of other things. However, the gameplay on it is terrible! Its like back and forth until something dies with no strategy. Get the game if you want, but not to have fun."
3,Too much waiting...,"I'm not a big RPG fan, so I don't know if this is some new trend or not, but most of this game is just watching cinematics of characters talking. So far I've logged over two hours of time on this game, and I'd say most of it has been spent watching mediocre plot lines unfold.It's a shame too, since there are some really innovative new techniques to building up character's abilities and the battles are fun as well.Basically if you don't mind waiting through scene after scene of bad voice overs, there is a fun game in there somewhere."
3,As entertaining as any of Squaresoft's films,"This game came highly recommended by people who generally have similar taste in games as me, but I'm still trying to figure out why.There's no question that the in-game graphics are impressive and the story-line is interesting. However the gameplay is nearly non-existant, and when you do happen to participate in some of the action the controls are either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated (i.e. the sphere grid or blitzball). Even the story is often poorly told, with stilted voices and hilariously bad character animation.If I had to compare this game to some of Squaresoft's other efforts, it is similar to a mix between Final Fantasy 8 and Chrono Cross. But while those two games were generally frowned upon by RPG enthusiasts, Final Fantsy X has recieved almost universal praise. In short, I'm not so much disappointed with the game as I am baffled by its warm reception."
1,I don't understand the hype.,"To be fair, this game has amazing graphics. The sound is also superb. However, I have to give it only 1 star because you don't actually get to play the darn game. I spent 2 hours in one sitting ""playing"" this game after initially opening it, and I felt like I had just watched a movie with no plot or ending. Bottom line: if you're not an avid role-playing-gamer, this game is probably not for you, especially with its turn based play that leaves you feeling as though there is no real action to be experienced in playing this game."
4,"Sooo fun, you miss your PS2 juss readin this!","Yupp. It's true! DIS GAME IS SOO MUCH FUN!!! YOUR miSSIN YOUR PS2 and Game JUSS READING ABOUT IT!! Well, as most other FF games, RPG, DIS OnE REALLY GOT DA INTREST INTO MEH!!! You hav a lot of players to be able to play! ANd BEST of ALL!!! YOU GEt ta PLAY BILZTBALL!! WHOOO!!!! Well, Yuna and Tidus following wit, Auron,LuLu,Wakka,Kimihara(spelling?) wit da kewlest RIKKU Go all ova Spira to defeat Sin. This game has many challenges, and it's not ALWAYS easy killing monsters and other such! It can be a struggle! but, It'S WORTH IT!"
3,Good but hard,"I bought this game and I thought it was very good at first. The graphics are great and it has a good story line. After a while it became very VERY hard! If your looking for a challenge you might like this game, but it is so hard it isnt fun"
2,It's suppose to be a game not a movie,"This game does indeed have some of the best graphics that I have ever seen, but you do more watching than you do playing. To me it seems that with each new release in the series squaresoft concentrates more on the graphics and less on the gameplay. I found this to be the easiest Final Fantasy to beat yet, and the shortest. It is a beatiful game to watch but that's most of what you'll do. I'd recommend renting it first. It is worth at least seeing the graphics."
3,"just okay, so far...",Storyline's kind of interesting so far (I'm about 4 hrs. into it) and it's definitely some good eye-candy but not quite as engrossing as some of the previous FF's. Possibly because not too much exploration is required.
4,Best Final Fantasy Ever?,"No, but close. Final Fantasy X introduces a multitude of new features, a new storyline, (obviously) and takes full advantage of the PS2's powers. The only thing that disapoints me is the ending, and some of the annoying voiceovers. Fans of Final Fantasy should not hesitate to buy it, while casual gamers should rent it and take it for a spin."
4,The best rpg game there is!!!!!,"It is absolutely great.The grapics,characters,playing,enemys,and everything else is awsome.Its such a good game that i spend days on it just eating a piece of bread.Its really exiciting and suspenseful.Its seems so real and like your actually there.Trust me this game is great!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Awful FF,"I was very hyped to try this game out. When I did, I was blown away at first, but as I progressed through the game I realized how slow and boring it is. The voice acting is ok at times, but terrible at most. The story is emotional, but the voice actors just couldn't add that to the game's characters. Which is a shame. I'd rather read the dialogue like in the previous FF games."
2,A different FF game,"Alright, for me this was dissapointing, the game system was totally messed, and what is up with the summons staying out? That kinda makes it cheap, seeing how you can have a summon Ultra-Powerful. Also, this is also cheap, the multi attaking system. My friends did like 5 hits with one char. every turn. Also, switching chars IN BATTLE! This is so cheap, it is not even funny, just cycle threw all the people once some one dies... But other then that, it is very good!"
5,FFX who don't know the Story,I'm new in ENG so it's hard to written review. FFX the most fantastic game in the world it's sad story but i like it i play the game for years
5,The greatest game for PS2 so far...,"This game is definitly one of the greatest games of all time. With voices, 3D environments, and interactive battles, this game is the best looking in its series. The storyline is great and sort of works through the game as if it were a novel. This game is very addicting from the very beginning. Trust me, this is well worth your $.... My only gripe about this game is that they could have used that extra month to sync up the lips correctly... but this is a very minor point in the game."
5,awesome,This was the first ever final fantasy game I ever played and I had to play all of them after playing this one. Amazing game and amazing seller. Thanks!
5,Gaming that defines Imagination,"Played this game ten years ago and still haven't played a game of this greatness in any video game, RPG or non-RPG. This game inspired me when i was a young boy to do great things and stretched my imagination greatly. Nostalgia is overwhelming every time i think about this game and till this day i have not replayed Final Fantasy X, but the hundreds of hours mastering this game is definitely burned into my memory hence the intense nostalgia. The combination of arguably the best storyline in the Final fantasy series and the tremendous gameplay that includes blitzball put this game over the top for me. Don't listen to the negative reviews and just play the game because many can vouch for its greatness. Still praying that square-enix remasters this game for the ps3, so i can play it again!"
5,"This is an RPG game, not action game.","First of all, this is the RPG game, its all about the STORY....STORY......STORY. So if you say people would get bored fighting chocobos and defeat the enemy with magic over and over again, then you're not following its story. I've played the demo, the graphics is amazing, in-game graphic is like FMV, you would not see the different. The voice, ah who cares 'bout voices, its great though. What else? Oh its for Playstation 2. Great."
3,Shallow as a pop song,"I love RPGs but what has happened? As everyone else says this is a pretty game but I miss the depth of what are pejoratively called 'old-style' games. As a 25 yr old I don't need cutesy junk (like tritely 'deep and complex' characters that are so tempting to wide-eyed maidens), on the other hand I'm not necessarily looking for the blood and sexuality of a mature rated game. This game is of the former category. This game doesn't have the depth of character or story that lets one get into the game; Where are lifelike motivations, emotion and behavior?!? Game design companies need recognize the older gamers' desires for intelligent games and hire a few less designers and hire a writer (and someone who can speak English to translate games!!!). You won't get depth here nor anywhere (I admit I thought FF9 was close to being great). I might just buy an old 16-bit sega and buy the Phantasy Star series."
5,REALLY FUN GAME FF10,"FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIKED HOW CHRONO CROSS LOOKED AND LIKED ALL THE OTHER FF THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.I'VE ONLY PLAYED 5 HRS OF IT AND I THINK ITS THE BEST, THE SUMMONINGS ARE AWESOME YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE THEM IN BATTLE AND DO THEIR MOVES WHEN THEIR LIMIT IS UP CALLED OVERDRIVES. THE MAGIC LOOKS GREAT LIKE ALWAYS HAS AND THE GRAPHICS ARE LIKE FF8 MIXED WITH THE CHRONO CROSS BACKROUND. THIS IS SERTINTLY THE BEST RPG OUT THERE AND BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHATS GOOD OR NOT AND THIS IS THAT ... GOOD."
3,"A great game, dont listen to the haters!","I thought that some of the game was a fault. The voices could be sappy and the story could make too little sense at times. Example, the encounter with sin early in the game and then people are in caskets and yuna does a sending like 60 seconds after the attack. By this time I expected people to be finding dead bodies..... in other words the time frame was a little off. atleast I feel that way about it. But on the good side it made me feel good because i could sympathize with the characters, the only other thing i didnt like was Seymour. His story was given away far to soon in the game. 3 stars for what it is, 5 stars if X-2 where factored in and you got it all in one game, also get rid of the crappy voices and confusing time line.I dont want to sound like a hater because i finished this game 3 times, and so found it enjoyable and found its faults easily."
4,this game is the best ever,my cousin had this game while i was at his house and i would have to say it is one of the best final fantasies yet(aside from ff7)it has awesome graphics and tidas is a little annoying.but is has more cutscenes than play time. its a fun game. anyone that is a rpg gamer should try it
3,Good but not that good,"Square put too much into the Final Fantasy Movie and not enough into this game. A lot of the plot leaves you wanting and the twists that were thrown were predictable and never fully developed.The graphics were excellent and going back to the turn based combat was a plus for strategy but the story, while good, could have been a whole lot better. The idea needed to be fleshed out more then they did. I hate to say it but unless Square begins to put out game comparable to FF7 and FF8 soon I may no longer purchase their games."
5,Great Game,This is 1 of the best games I've ever played. It's a great mixture of grpahics and storyline. This is a definant must have.
4,Just great,Wow this game sure is one of the best FF i ever played.I just didn't like the MP system since FF9.But still this is one of the best ever with the voice in and the 3D graphics.In a few words: This is a must!
5,Jester,"I've played every FF game there is to play and I have to say that I am highly impressed with FFX. The graphics rock, and the storyline has enough there to keep you into the game. I did enjoy NOT having to read the whole game. The way the side quests/games are more incorparated with the game makes doing them very worthwhile, unlike some other RPG's. And since the chocobo training/racing in FFVII, I am always anxious to see what they will do next. Unfortunately, the chocobo training in FFX was the only thing that had me disappointed. No matter how many times you do any ""training"" your mentally handicapped chocobo doesn't seem to get it. I have seen buses that react faster and more accurately. I think that they did better in FFVIII for the chocobo side quest."
4,"It's Not FF IX, and that's a good thing.","FFX is totally cool. The battle system is great. Being able to switch your people in and out of battle is an awesome idea. The level buliding system is... one of a kind, for better or worse. On the good side of it, I don't have to learn abalitys I won't use (like one that makes all the monsters go after one person) but on the bad side, my theif learned Holy before my White Mage/Summoner.But this is by far the 3rd best Final Fantasy out there (With VI and VIII ahead of it). If you're a die hard final fantasy fan who has a gold copy of PMM and a plush moogle named Kupu, or if you're just a rookie gamer looking for something that reeks of awesomeness, FFX is sure to hit the spot.Always Believe,SynKyd"
4,Decent(Spoiler),"it is a good game, and it is done very well. The CG scenes are just awesome, and Square's choice of music was equally great. However, it isnt worth playing through. Omega Weapon, which should be nearly unbeatable, i killed in 3 hits. And it is impossible to lose the last fight. It's way too easy. Other than that its a great game, good story line, etc., etc. It just takes away from what FF should be."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"This is a ""MUST HAVE"" Game!!!! I read all the reviews before purchasing FFX and the game is truely AMAZING.It has everything I look for:Action,Adveture,GREAT story and don't let me forget AWESOME GRAPHICS! I don't need to go into lengthy details about it b/c everything you read and heard is ALL true. It is mind blowing... I've been obsessed with the game since day one. I can't wait until FFXI."
5,Best Final Fantasy!,"The Final Fantasy saga is the best RPG saga out there. If you think that this game is a ""movie"", you [are wrong]. This game has a lot of action, and even though there are a lot of movie clips(just like in every other Final Fantasy game), you get to play and walk around. A lot. This game also features a deep storyline, which needs the movie clips so you could understand it. The video CGI is awesome, especially the Blitzball tournament at the starting. The music is awesome, so are the graphics. If you don't like this game because it ha a lot of movie clips, than you shouldn't consider yourself a Final Fantasy fan. This is the best of it's kind!"
2,"the pain, the horror","Please don't buy this game, or, even better, buy as many copies of this game as you can and burn them all! Seriously though, the game isn't too terrible, but it doesn't deserve to be apart of the same franchise as other final fantasy games (namely american ffII, III and VII). The change back to a turn based battle system is cool, and so is the concept that you can change characters mid-battle, but the level up system just angers me, the sphere grid is just annoying, especially if you try to max out your characters, because to best do so, you need abilities (i.e triple AP, and Triple overdrive + overdrive-->AP)that are available so late in the game that you have little time to enjoy your uber-characters. The puzzles in the game are annoying and repetitive and the plot, while not too confusing, is non-sensical, contrived, and altogether stupid. Square should have spent more time on making the main quest of the game enjoyable rather than making many long and annoying side-quests"
3,Tidus and Auron In the Middle of The Street,If you've had your PS2 for awhile and/or haven't had it cleaned then chances are this game will freeze up on you during rendered cut-scenes. There's a bug in the first 15 minutes of the game where two characters are on the screen and they will just stand there because PS2 can't read what is going to happen next on the disc. I know I'm not the only one with this problem and other people have had similiar problems with the game freezing if not some where else during the game.
5,Do I need to say anything?,"Just simply: WoW! You're the gamer, you've already been introduced to the Final Fantasy series and you know what's real and what's fantasy.Great gameplay, it will last a least a couple of days, sharp in-game graphics (DVD/PS2, remember?), Nobuo Uematsu's soundtrack (the japanese John William), breath-taking cutscenes... yup, it's a top-selling Final Fantasy title.What's bad about it? Like all story, it has an ending... after some 60-80 hours of gameplay."
5,The standard of future RPG's have been set.,"The many RPG's that have came out in the many years of video games, nothing even comes close to Final Fantasy X. The Characters are so detailed and and look so real it's breathtaking. If you want a game with GREAT character development and the best story I have ever seen, buy this game."
4,Very excellent,"The game came in very excellent condition. It came in a timely manner, although I felt like I could have paid a little less for shipping and it would have been here the same time. Overall Very Good."
4,Final Fantasy X,"The game plays quite well. :) I am very happy with the coddtion the game was in, and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast I recieved the game. I'm very very happy with the product. Thank you very much."
5,FFX is perfect for RPG veterans and beginners alike,"i know alot of people think that the best game to be released recently is Halo, but i think this game blows Halo right out of the water. first of all, FFX not only has an absolutely killer plot, but the way the developers were able to capture each characters facial expretions so perfectly is just incredible. in FFX, at some pionts you realy feal like you are watching a movie. the PS2 powered graphics help give Final Fantasy a whole new look and feel to the piont that once in a while you begin to forget that this is only a video game. the new Sphere Grid battle system is equally amazing in that it's not difficult to learn even if you are a beginner. i highly recommend that anyone with a PS2 who hasn't picked this up yet to buy this as soon as possible. i also must add that the other Final Fantasys are worth getting as well even though they are pretty outdated now."
2,Huge Disapointment,"I was very excited to try this game, and when I started, it was really cool. When I got into battle mode, I couldn't believe how [poor] it is. The battle mode is very similar to POKEMON...you press ""Attack"" on the screen, and your character automatically runs up to the villian, hits him, and runs back. Don't waste your money....Metal Gear Solid 2:Sons of Liberty, and Devil May Cry and great games. Buy these instead!"
1,It's a waste unless you want a cartoon DVD,"This, for me, was the biggest waste of money. It is an animated story that has very mild interaction. For me, it is not a game. If you want to watch a cartoon for most of the time and then play for a couple of minutes and then watch a cartoon for a while and then play for a couple of minutes, etc., etc., then you will love this game, otherwise save your money. If you really are curious, rent it first. This way you don't waste forty+ dollars like I did. The animation is good, but I'm not going to review this for game play, because I do not consider it a game. Some love this game, and some hate it.....This is a rent first, buy later (if you like it)."
1,"How can you call this garbage a ""game""?","This is possibly the worst game I have ever played (and we're talking going all the was back to the Atari 2600). There is nothing in this cheesy after-school-special movie that even resembles a game.Don't get me wrong, the graphics are excellent. However, the graphics get boring after about 5 minutes of ""gameplay"" and there is absolutely nothing to support this ""game"" after that. I don't understand how you can have two hours of some kid looking startled by every sound and call it a story.I have played this game for about 2 hours and have absolutely no desire to play it any longer. If I wanted to look at pretty scenery for 40 hours I'd sit through ""Dances with Wolves"" 13 times, it's just about as interactive."
1,Why you shouldn't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We got this game because we thought you would be able to control what types of moves and attacks the characters can do. The thing we really hate about this game are the movies. They literally take an hour. During the movies you get so bored you just want to turn it off. Please listen to us! We wasted our money on this and you don't have to.
1,Worst FF Ever,"Do not buy this game, it has a bang-up storline like the producers didn't ever try, the characters were all screwed up. it was like watching an old bruce lee movie where they dubbed over the words in English but you could still see the person talking in chinese or something. the main character was so stupid, he was like a valley girl-never knowing what the hell was going on. if this game didnt have the Final Fantasy label on it, no one would have touched it. the only reason some poeple gave it 4 or 5 stars is cause they are nerdy hardcore ff lovers who need to get a life. one of the reasons i gave it 1 star is cause ive played 7-8-9 and they were ok. but this one, o my god, it was horrible. u coudnt even level up, u just get ponts to put into different skills after a few battles. i just hope they dont bring in the stupid blitz ball again, that was such a waste of time. the ony thing that was ok(not good, just ok) were the graphics..."
1,And I hoped it was the FINAL fantasy...,"These series are horrible, people. 10 installments, and there is the 11th one on the horizon!! Oh no, I can't take it any longer! Why can't Squaresoft develop another title, not final fantasy related.If you still like RPGs, then go with Morrowind, or Neverwinter Nights."
1,Horrible movie / Horrible Game,"Final Fantasy X is supposed to be a role playing game. There is no role playing in this game. You watch about 40 hours of movies and actually control your characters for a couple hours. When you do get to control your characters you can't go anywhere but the few screens that they give you. There is no adventure, no free will, no variation. I've played many RPGs and was really excited to get this game. I could not be more disappointed. If you're looking for an RPG (as opposed to a 40 hour movie) take your money elsewhere."
1,This biggest disappointment since Battle Field Earth,"I have been waiting to play this game for over a year. I have read on all the video game sites every week, looking at screen shots, videos etc. To be blunt this is not a video game, it is a 40 hour movie, that lets you push buttons every 5 minutes for about 30 seconds. There is not playing involved, the people who like this game obviously dont like to PLAY video games they would rather watch videos. The graphics look good, but so does Shrek, its the same concept, its not a good looking video game its a good looking movie. I wish I could find some poor fool to buy this from me for the [money] I wasted on it."
2,Winey hero ruined it for me,"Alright, the graphics are great. The story line is great. The fighting is great. However, I just wanted to slap ...my main character every time he talked. He is the saddest little punk character that the FF series has ever had. It just ruined the whole game for me. I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it."
1,SUCKS MY POO,THIS GAME IS SO BAD THAT I MOVED OUT OF MY MOM'S HOUSE TO GET AWAY FROM THE EVIL THAT IT HAS SPREAD. SOMETIMES I MISS HER WARM BASEMENT AND MY COMIC BOOK COLLECTION. I AM ON A MISSION FROM GOD TO DESTROY THE FINAL FANTASY X LOVERS USING ASPRIN!!!!!! NOW IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO AND LOAD UP ON STYROFOAM BASED WEAPONS TO HELP MY OPERATION.
1,THIS GAME SUCKS...,"one word to sum up this game would be...BORING!!!!!! it felt like i was watching a movie, a terrible movie! i can't believe i wasted my money on this. i bought this and ffx-2 but thank God i didn't open ffx-2 or else i wouldn't be able to return it! unforetunately, i opened ffx, so now i am stuck with it! ahhhh, it sucks so bad. ff7 is the best;it is so fun and the characters are awesome! i like the characters in ffx-2, rikku, paine, and yuna (in that order) but i don't like the game! ffx and ffx-2 are bad games! blah, don't waste your money and make the same mistake like i did."
5,2nd Best Final Fantasy,"I have played Final Fantasy VII, VIII, IX, and X, and I think that this is only second to Final Fantasy VII. Sure, there are movies, but like the CG cutscenes in the PSX ones, these advance the plot. Although I was a bit disappointed with its linear story, I only noticed that after I beat it (because a lot of people just mentioned that to me). If you play more than 5 hours of it, you will discover why this game is so great: great story, great gameplay, and you'll finally discover the greatness of the sphere grid. Saying that this is more of a movie than a game is really kind of cheap, I mean, Square was only tring to utilize the PS2's capabilities. After FFVII, this is the best RPG I have ever played, and I've played a lot. The people who say that this is not a good game have probably not beaten it."
5,my love,I play this game almost every single nighti jsut cant stop playing blitzballso much fun and the game is awsome toLulu is hot and Tidus is pretty coolKimahri looks like a thugAuron looks like a rapistand then there is Yuna.....lets jsut say i moved to South Africa to legally marry this game
4,Not Impressed.,"This is the first of the Final Fantasy games I have played and most likely will be the last. The game although beautiful in graphics and story line was sorely lacking in actual game play. It felt more like watching a movie and periodically getting to push a button intermitently to strike a foe. I buy games to play not to watch. There were some side games that were interesting but the turn based combat left me wanting much, much more. I really enjoyed Kingdom Hearts which was based on Final Fantasy characters (along with Disney)but this game left me disappointed at most."
4,An enthralling RPG from Square.,"After the disappointments of FF8 and FF9, FFX is a nice breath of fresh air into the franchise. It's levelling system (specifically the sphere grid) is a bit obtuse at times but it allows you a rather nice control over how each character developes over time. The mini-games are addictive once you get the hang of them, though Blitzball isn't for everyone. As always, the plot and visuals are wonderful, and I like how they changed the battle system. It really lends itself to strategy now.Hmm... Cons would be that there is no japanese voice track, and the first fourty hours of gameplay, roughly, are basically one huge tutorial. If you can slog through that, and you're a die-hard RPG fan, I think you'll find this game is DEFINITELY worth your money."
5,final fantasy,I have always been a fan of the final fantasy series but this definately the best. The graphics are outstanding. And the video sequence's amazing
3,To much effort on character voices than on actual game play,It's a great game but I miss that ability to revisit past location after your character has grown more powerful. Still had a great time. To much effort on character voices than on actual game play. Jody Bissoon
4,Oh this is a GREAT level up system!,"THE BAHAMUT IT IS!!! Since when did you have to spend Sphere Levels to gain stat boosts across a map!? I don't even think Final Fantasy XII has this, and we all know how Star Wars-ish that game is(in a good way). Listen, this is a very good game, in fact the turn-based system harkens to Mega Man X: Command Mission if you look at the sidebar on the right side of the battle screen close enough, but it would've been another really good Final Fantasy title IF IT WASN'T FOR THE LEVEL UP MAP!!! And yes, I enjoy taking summons' names in vain to piss off fanboys. :3"
4,Not Bad for a Final Fantsy game,"Well....Before i start [complaining], i would like to say ienjoyed this game very much. I spent many a hour playing it. The graphics are SUPERB. Some are the very best i have ever seen on this system. But, alas, it has some faults. The main charecter, Tidus, is a wee bit of a WHINER. He has the voice of a child's and complains (and dresses) like one. His dialouge is kind of spotty too. But the charecters are solid, and you definitely start to love them. The basis of evil in this one is a elemental bombarder of evil is Sin. (original name lol :P) They have to stop it from destroying Spira, (the place) and or group of peeps have to kill it. Fun task."
4,Nothing new but good nonetheless,"What can I say about FFX. It really is milestone in the Final Fantasy series with the inovation of facial expressions and SPEAKING. The graphics are up to par with anything you would expect from any game for the PS2 from Square would be. The controls are really simple to learn and the learning curve is adequate for beginners to the series. Now over to the storyline, which nothing new. You'll find quite a similar story in another Squaresoft gem called Xenogears, which has a more original story But for what seems like the last FF series that isn't an online RPG it is definitely something worth trying."
5,the Greatest game Ever Made...,"whoa- Final Fantasy X is the Greatest game ever made:Graphics: When you see the opening Fmv, you will be STUNNED!!Gameplay- Its pretty much okay, but not the greatestStoryline: Sad... THE ENDING IS SO SAD!! FFX has made a very great impact on my life- i couldnt stop thinking about it the day i finished it. I Love Final fantasy X- I don't know why people hate it... It is truly one of the besst games ever made (if it isnt the greatest)"
5,Final Fantasy X...pros and cons,"The best thing about FFX is probably the graphics. Some parts in the game look so realistic that you mistake it for a real picture. The characters in this game also speak out loud so you dont always have to read it, and you can press the button if you dont want to hear it. The story line is also great. If you get irritated with mazes easily, be prepared because even though there are few mazes, some can be difficult. The game is almost like a 65 hour long movie, you can think of someone or something as one thing, but then it turns out way different. There is a lot of action in it and it has the best graphics i have ever seen. The cheapest I have seen a new game is 15 dollars at a mall. ^_^"
2,This is a 13 year old named gabe,ok now first of all the graphics in this game are the best. How ever this completely ruins all purpose of the final fantasy tradition of cut scene FMV's which have always been the best. Also although they did have voice acting it was not worth it for the bad voicing and the stupid characters and story. First of all i dont think that this game even had a story line. Also i felt completely un attached to the characters if titus or yuna died i wouldnt of cared i would of gone and played Final Fantasy 8 which is what RPG's should be all about. If squall or rinoa died i would of beat my tv with a hammer. So horible game play horible story horrible FMV's awsome graphics HORRIBLE characters....what can i say
3,"Nice graphics, and Voice Acting is a plus, however..........","The games looks amazing, I'll give you that. I'll probably end up getting it, but if it's like 8 and not like the other's, then I don't think it's gonna be that great. FF8 was good for many different reasons, but it should not be a part of the FF Series. Final Fantasy was built around magic, knights, mages, etc. I've played Final Fantasy since 2 through 9, including the jap one's and the only reason that the games are THAT great, is because of the story and fantasy realm. I'm sure 10 will be no exception, the story will be great, with some incredible moments, however since it's more realistic (like FF8), I really don't see it being that ""special"". Take this for what you will."
1,BAD,"OK, THIS GAME HAS SOME GOOD THINGS BUT THEY DONT MAKE THIS GAME GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO GIVE IT 2 STARS. FIRST OF ALL I BOUGHT THIS GAME BECAUE I WANTED SOME ACTION. I WANTED TO FIGHT THE ALIEN THINGS OR WHATEVER ...THEY ARE AND I WANTED TO HAVE CONTROL OVER MY...SWORD. INSTEAD OF ME BEING ABLE TO RUN UP THE THE ALIEN AND DICE IT...THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, THE CAMERA ANGLES ARE OK, AND THE SRORY IS OK. DONT WASTE THE MONEY LIKE I DID!!! IT WASNT WORTH IT. IF YOU LIKE POKEMON AND YOU DONT LIKE FUN ACTION, BUY THIS GAME, BUT IF YOU ARE A SMART GAMER LIKE ME, DONT SPEND THE MONEY!"
2,"And this is a game, huh?","I will admit - I never played any FF game before, so I bought this from a ""competitor"" site.... I didn't get the game. This is one of the most boring games I ever played, why do people like this? I mean, you don't get to do anything... 2/3 of your time is spent watching multiple 'cut' scenes, it's like watching an animated movie. Then every now & then you get to fight and move around. Ohhh and the fighting, I guess I'm used to games like Tomb Raider, but you never actually ""hit"" anyone... it's just a bunch of arrows telling you that you hit someone - no real character interaction! After about a week, I stopped playing and sold it on the same ""competitor"" site. Only redeaming points are; the graphics are well done and the music is cool. If you like games where the characters actually interact and fight each other, turn and run from this game - pure hogwash. But obviously a lot of people like it... I'm in the minority I guess. Happy Gaming!"
5,This game changed my life.,"Honestly, it did.I'm the sort of person who takes ideas and runs with them and let me tell you, Final Fantasy X gave me a whole new world to base my imagination around. The characters, the aeons, the music, they were all brilliant to me and changed me as a person.This is the best game I have ever or will ever play.Very highly recommended, obviously."
5,BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!...,"I have to be honest with you, when i first started this game I thought it was the most unfun game. But then as I played on, I realized what was going on and I began to love it. I play this game everyday. 3 words can describe this game:FAB-U-LOUS! For those people who give this a 2 or below, they're quitters. And hey I can't blame you, I almost was like you. So don't give up on this game in the beginning just because you don't understand it or just don't like it. It gets better. I wouldnt recommmend this game to people who cry at emotional things or dislike tear jerkers. This game is both entertaining and splendid. Buy this game, trust me you WONT regret it!"
5,Incredible,"When I first heard of FFVII, I thought it was awesome when I played it. Then I thought FFVIII was too, as well as FFIX. They all got betterevery time, and I knew it couldn't get better than FFIX. But Squaresoft did it. This game has it all. It's battles and storyline are awesome, with gorgueos graphics. The characters are even more cool and emotional than last time. None of these cutesy characters like Quina or Vivi, but tough, scary looking characters like Auron and Kimhari. This game is the greatest game of all time. If you like game like Chrono Cross or Action games such as GTA3 and Meatl Gear 2. If you don't like this game, don't play another game after. I don't think it will get much better than this."
5,Fantastic,"I have to admit that I have been a fan of Final Fantasy games since I played Final Fantasy IV. Final Fantasy X had the best graphics that I have seen in a game and the story is engaging. Several friends have referred to the game as an interactive movie, since it looks so great and it is so smooth."
1,Final Fantasy X...... please......,"this game is dumb and the people who like it just like the same thing over and over again (u just use the same spells and stuff). The only fun thing about is Blitz ball, and that is were the 1 star comes in! so here is a warning to all rpgers out there, stay away from this game cause if u buy it, you just wasted money. Instead of this, buy Golden Sun for the GBA or Final Fantasy Chronicles (Chrono Trigger is the BEST!!!) for the PS1."
1,Mind-numbing waste of time,"I have been the largest supporter of all previous Final Fantasy games, and eagerly awaited ""X""... however- there is little to no fighting and character build takes no thought and is out of your control. Everything is scripted, and the movie sequences are agonizingly long, although the story is not that bad. BUT, THIS IS NOT A GAME! This is an interactive movie, in which you could close your eyes and just push the ""x"" button continuously for 36 hours and have the ""game"" be over. Not worth anyone's time- I am deeply dissapointed."
2,Over-rated,"This game is so over rated. I bought because if the goo reviews, but was very disappointed. Long, tedious, and boring. I had to force myself to finish it."
2,you have all got to be kidding,"What happened to the good old days where video games were played and not watched. If its not one random battle after another, its watching long cinemas constantly. There is not feeling of interaction or accomplishemnt since the game just shoves you along. Sure it looks great but who cares if you cant do anything with it. The minigames are terrible too."
5,THE COOLEST,"This game rocks! Though I've only buyed VIII and X(I plan on buying X-2), this game is the coolest. The graphics are really sweet and the Sphere Grid is better than any other things like that. Even though you can't level up your characters, and it,by FF standards,isnt really long, that defenately dosent take away from the fun of it all. The really dishtinguishing part is that you can play with your aeons and they dont just pop out, do a little cut-scene and leave. May Yevon be with you. LOL. See Ya!"
4,"great game, but you really dont need 3-4 of your players","i have to say, overall this was a very good game, however what i didnt like was towards the end you didnt need the characters wakka, rikku, lulu, or even kihimari(sry if i spelled that wrong). that dissapointed me. with the sphere grid you could basically take over the black mage position with yuna. once you get your ultimate weapon with auron and yuna you are basically unstoppable. i thought the game was way to short and the end boss was very easy. the summons or aeons or whatever the damn things are called are great to look at, and i like how they fight for you and have their own hp and dont just come in for one hit then leave. overall i wasnt dissapointed but was left wanting more. i guess ffx-2 will be alright, except no auron which sucks."
5,True Classic!!,"PS2 has made the grade with FF. FF8 was truly great and still one of my favorites along side FF7 and FF9, however, the speaking parts and the graphics moved me closer to the FF series even closer..keep it up!!. The only bad thing about the game is that they left out the card games..that stinks, other than that well worth time and money."
5,more watching than playing,my one complaint is that you watch 80% of the game and the little bit you do play is when you are walking a few feet so they can show the next cinema. overall this is an excellent game
5,It really IS that good,I'm a FF fan. But even if I wasn't I would have turned into one after this game. My sister and friends sit around watching me play it as if there's a movie on.The modifications from the older final fantasy series is amazing and the added speach gives it exactly what it lacked.It's a must have.
2,I want to punch Tidus in the face...,"Never before have I hated the main character of a game so much. There's really nothing that spectacular about this game. The graphics are great for PS2, the turn based fighting is a nice touch, but everything else about this game is laughable. The story line was sad, the voice acting is terrible, and seriously, the enemy is a dude dressed in drag. Whatever happened to real villains like Sephiroth? I bought this game so cheap, that I'm not even going to force myself to complete it. If you like stories that are exciting, well written, full of twists and turns, and have characters with depth, KEEP LOOKING; I guarantee that this is not that game."
2,This game was not so great,"well, there were great graphics, the plot was cheesy, the characters were idiots and the game play was horrible. I'm sorry but I couldn't stand this game. the further I got the more I grew to hate it. You do all this reapetitive fighting to get to maybe a few seconds of great graphics. they liked to talk to lot to. I guess that's what role playing games do, but these characters were just so dumb. So if you haven't gotten this game and don't know why you haven't, now you know."
3,Don't buy if you're impatient.,"The experienced Final Fantasy gamer knows what to expect with FFX. Those unfamiliar with it should find it intuitive and engaging, just slow at times. Personally, I can only play this game for short periods of time and would not replay it."
2,did not play on a box,did not play it will not play on my x box like to get one to play like ffxiii2 ok
2,THIS GAME SUCKS!!REALLY IM NOT KIDDING!!,"I bought this game with a couple other games when i first bought my ps2 and this game was such a failure, i really think i used my money on a stupid game...the reason why i gave it 2 stars is just because of the graphics. ... all my friends played it and all got bored except one... some people may like this game because its easy to win (most of the time) and because it has awesome graphics but the gameplay has no sense, you hit, he hits you, you hit, he hits you thats how it goes all the way so the most powerfull wins...it also has lots of movies which some you cant fast forward ... if youre into cool games like gtaa3 or gran turismo or tony hawks then dont buy this game because its just a waste of money!!believe me!"
2,Yuck!,"I have been a role-play fan for many years, and I have to ask ""Where is the role-playing?"". This is more movie than game, and I'm sad to see that Square decided to bring the series here. I will say that the graphics are stunning, the story is decent, and the sound is good...but the gameplay bites. The major flaw is that you don't feel as if you are in control of anything. The game forces you to go to the next event, witness it, and move to the next. This is how many RPG's start, but this one is entirely like that. Also, the character advancement system is retarded. If you ever want to have a character who is truly great, you will literally have to spend DAYS bringing him around the stupid grid. What was wrong with a level system? And where are the moogles??? A FF title without moogles is just wrong. In short, save your money. I wish I had."
2,Rent before owning!!,"I'm not a Final Fantasy fan - only because I haven't had a gaming system in years. I was really excited to try out this new game that I was positive I would really enjoy. I'm still trying to like it 8 hours into the game! Now, it is obviously good enough to keep my interest for this long, but I'm sure I'd never want to replay it. From what I have gathered, it's like an interactive movie. You go where you are led, you watch a lot of movie clips, you fight monsters and expect a hard battle, but it takes no skill or strategy to defeat.I actually cannot believe so many people think this game is so great. I'm assuming you must be a Final Fantasy fan to truly enjoy this game."
2,It was okay...,"If you want a longterm game that you'll actually want to play over and over again, this game is not for you.As a reporter and forum maintainer at gamespot.com, I've played the Japanese version of this game. Unfortunately, the story is a bit lacking in most parts and after the ""glare"" of this game fades away, you'll most likely wish you bought some other game, Be it the classic games like Chrono Trigger, or newer unappreciated games like the Breath of Fire series, Dragon Warrior VII, and Super Smash Bros Mele.My advice is to rent this game first for a week or two. At first I thought this game was going to revolutionize gaming too, but I soon realized that if all games were like this, I'd drop out of the industry."
2,epic fail,"this game gets boring as you go, the story is rather bland, and whoever came up with the ending needs to be slapped. it sucked! you'll want to put your PS2 through a wall when this game is over. buy 'Star Ocean: til the end of time' instead. it is waaaaaaaaay better.but if you are still interested...the premise is the same as every other final fantasy game. there is a good guy. a bad guy. a guy that turns out to be the real baddest bad guy and a chick. add in a quest, random battles, optional megaultrasuper bosses, characters that join with bad attitudes and reaaaaaaaaaalllllllllly big weapons. don't get me wrong, square enix pumps out some good RPG's, but this one just sucked."
5,effin awesome,this game has everything and is effing awesome totally get it :)of course if you still love your ps2
3,Not too great,"The story is too one dimensional for my taste. Think this is the worst FF game yet, but that is saying that it's still better than 60% of the games out there!"
4,Cool graphics & entertaining,"An instant classic!, FFX delivered a powerful storyline joined with some of the coolest graphics on PS2, the game's possibilities are huge, and it's hard to get bored.OK so not all of it is good. Japanese perception of cool is a bit odd at times!, the game should've been spoken in Japanese with english subtitles!, I mean, the lip synching is really bad!. Such details are not so important for gameplay but you would need everything to be perfect for your money, you gotta love this game anyway!"
4,Role Player,"I've been playing this game for a little while and so far I love it. I wish, as with all SquareSoft games, there was a way to save whenever you need to rather than having to play on until you find a save spot. But the fighting is awesome and the storyline pulls you in. I love SquareSoft games and haven't found one yet I wouldn't reccommend."
4,Good if You have spare time,"I've beat the game and its really fun. If u love RPG's and role playing games(as I do), and have lots of spare time its just for u.The story is pretty interesting. Its kinda sad that the bad guy of the game (Sin) is not the last guy to beat.The graghics-4.5 starsStory line-4.5 starsBlittzball is real fun. If u don't know what it is its a underwater sport that u can play in the game.The Aeons are the bomb. I name mine weird names.This game is real fun, but I reccomend a guide even though I didn't have one the first time around."
5,FFX,"FFX is great. It has the best graphics, it looks almost as if it's real. The plot is very good for an RPG. The fighting is even better than #9. I haven't seen a game this good since Chrono Chross."
5,This is just the beginning !!!,"All i can say is WOW...i just played it for like 3 hours and omg...it is amazing showing the true graphical power of the PS2.. i was just awed by the cutscenes and for trhe first time FF goes voice-acting..,but the voice-acting most of the time doesn't match the with the facial-expressions , the whole game itself compensates for that... And the Sphere Grid is abit confusing in the beginning when you first learn it , but it gets very easy after awhile.Go out and buy this game.. it's a must have for the PS2 even if ur not a RPG-fan, you will get hooked on it even from the movie-sequence at the beginning of the GAME !!!Take out your CREDIT-CARD and buy it, because the next final fantasy is an online only-game.well that what i heard, so you will have to wait for FF 12.So BUY FINAL FANTASY X NOW !!! Or you'll be just another SQUARE !!! Get it..LOL"
5,Great Game,"This game is the best game I have played on PS2. It is a great RPG with a great involved story, and fairly good gameplay. The main character sounds like a dork, but other than that, the voice acting is very good. The battle system is very good, although it is very different than the ATB system. The ability learning system is so-so, but it is not terrible. Be warned however, this is a very linear game. You have very little freedom until late in the game, and so, the game plays a lot like a movie. This game also is somewhat shorter than the previous 3 installments in the Final Fantasy series. This is a great game overall, and it is the best RPG I've played since FF7."
3,Not the best Final Fantasy I've seen,"I know a lot of you guys will hate me for this but. FF10 lacks what a lot of the other FF's have. Personally my friends and I think FF7 was the best...Great story, ok graphics, a HUGE mystery, awesome characters and much much more. Also characters in other final fantasies have more backround and certain ""issues"" to deal with. Thats what I think FF10 lacks. Also it was kinda cool that FF7 had tons of cussing in it and serious more ""grown-up"" issues. Thats something new."
4,This game is awsome,"I hope everyone will get this game. The graphics are extrodinary. The plot is nothing I have ever seen before. If you dont get this game, then your missing out on the time of your life."
4,Great game...,"I love this game, the story, the action, the characters, and I really loved their faces when they find out that the so called god the've been preying to for a thousand years was really the bad guy that brought them all ther misery. If you love RPG menu fighting games then you will really love this game, this was the first Final Fantasy game that I ALMOST cried in. The fighting system is really cool although it kinda is the same as any other Menu game, the characters are extraordinary and the talking is really funny especialy when Yuna impersonates Wakka when you go into a battle. Don't belive all those people that say that this is a usual ""Save the World and Die"" game although it kinda is, it's still worth having."
4,The Fantasy of Final Fantasy X (10),"Square has worked of its butt trying to make this game, and it was worth it too! Taking account of all the Final Fantasys this one probably ties with FF7. The battle system is perfect and not to complicated like FF8 is. And the music is fresh and tangy. Plus instead of having 2D backrounds, like all the other Final Fantasys, this one has 3D backrounds,wich would make it so you would be able to change the camera angle! This game for sure is going on my top ten, it should be on yours too. And guess what else is new other then the tottaly high-tec graphics......REALL VOICES, INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HURT YOUR EYES READING THE SMALL TEXT!! Its tottaly worth the ... $. Maybe you should buy it from Amazon too.They have the best prices.Just buy it now, it's an explosion for your buck. ( 9.5 / 10 )"
5,Amazing Addition to the seris,The story line in this game is amazing. As far as Im concerned it's right up there with Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics. The graphics are outstanding...Ive come to the conclusion that in some scenes that it looks better than real life. This game would be an excellent addition to anyone who players RPGs.
4,and this is why rpgs rock!,"this is the first game i got when i bought my ps2. i loved it from the start! i have loved final fantasy games since i bought my playstation, and thought this game was awesome! all of the characters look good and have their own unique personality. i like the way the battle system works, and the story is wonderful! get this game if you don't already have it. you won't regret it!"
2,Eye Candy and not much else.....,"Squaresoft and Final Fantasy games usually get great reviews. The voice acting really sucks the actors sound like they're reading emotionlessly. But the fact that it has voice acting at all is pretty neat. Pretty boring. I guess if you've played any FF it's just the same as the one before it but with better graphics. Speaking of graphics this game is total eye candy. The sweetest graphics I've ever seen. The only thing I don't like about the graphics are that they are too bright, happy and colorful. I haven't played much yet, only about 2 hours or so but I'm pretty sure I'm going to just abandon it until I finish playing Shadow Hearts. With the real-time expressions and voice acting instead of text this game really should be fun. I guess I'm probably just sick of playing these FF games. But knowing myself I'll probably fire up the Gameshark 2 and play it quick just to see the movies..."
4,"good, but not FF VII","I had very, very high expectations for this game, since I'd heard such good things. It is a good game and all, but, it's just not as good as FF VII. Lets start with the bad things. First off, BLITZBALL, The side quests were boring, the summons were lacking (wheres cactuar?)Now the good things. The new battle system adds alot more strategy to the game, the soundtrack is spectacular, especially when you fight Braskas last summon, The sphere grid is fun too. Best of all is the story, one of my favorite stories in all Final Fantasy games. The characters you get to play as have fun stories too.It's not the best Final Fantasy game, but its alot better than FF8 and FF9 (thats not saying much)"
5,i have no idea what to call this review,"what can i say....this is a great game. In the previous Final Fantasy games, i hated how you had to level up in order to become stronger. I liked this game because instead of having to level up, u become stronger by adding spheres into a sphere grid.The 3D graphics during the game-play is eye-popping, where in the other final fantasy games, the graphics were boxy and only had certain points where there would be good graphics.overall, if you're an rpg fan, this game is definitely the game u wanna get."
5,LIKE ALWAYS SUPERB,"There are no words to express how I felt when I finished the game, it's unexpected, but It's an original ending. All ff are unique and every release has its own magic, try to play this game, you'll really love it."
4,This game rocks!,"Final Fantasy X is one of the greatest games I have evr played. It has a great plot. The ending is great, but sad. The characters are cool, but sometimes they say really wierd and random things. If i were to give this game a score on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 10! This game will make you want to play Final Fantasy X-2, trust me I have both of them. This game is almost non-stop action unless the characters are talking to each other."
5,Most addicting FF game yet,"Wow. You couldn't ask for more in a game! The graphics are amazing throughout the entire game, but the cutscene's are absolutely incredible. I could not believe it when I saw them!The plot was great as well (dark at times), containing many twists and turns. I found that the very beginning was a little lacking, but then again I haven't especially liked any Final Fantasy beginning and they've all turned out to be great.I loved the music. I don't think it had the best of the FF series, but it definately set itself apart from the others. (I personally loved FFVI's music).I just loved the entire game. It may very well be my favorite game of all time! The whole game just blew me away. I HIGHLY recommend it."
2,I Don't Really Care What You Think...,"I just need to get this off my chest. Numero Uno, ""Final Fantasy VII"" is the best of the series, far outdistancing this game despite the better graphics etc...... ... I could go on and on. This game is flat out wimpy. If you're a FF Fanatic and buy this game, you'll be sorry you didn't take my advice..."
4,an excellent addition to the FF series,"This was an amazing game. Most of the fun of any other FF title with the graphics of the PS@. Some plusses are the new level up system (which would seem very confusing if I explained it here, but is actually quite simple. play the game and find out for yourself), the fact that the characters talk, amazing graphics, and an improvement on the GFs from FFVIII called Aeons. Some minuses...there's no world map, so exploring doesn't have the same thrill, some characters have abilities that are completely impractical (such as one character's ability to learn enemy attacks...that do almost no damage) and the lamea$$ minigame...blitzball, which is in essence, turn based football. And you HAVE to play this stupid waste to get some rare items. Oh well. It's definitely not like the FFVIII card game or the golden saucer in FFVII. This is a must have game, though. buy it now."
5,This game is awesome!,I am not even half way through this wonderful game and I love it. The only thing I don't like is how I can just play it for hours on end and keep going. It is very addictive.
5,"It's not FFVII or VIII, but it comes close!","This game falls short of the gigantic FFVIII's length and FFVII's Hollywood worthy soundtrack. The voice acting is very good, but I would have liked to be able to hear the original Japanese dialogue track. Nevertheless, this game is a beaut. Vibrant, colorful visuals, astounding CG cinemas (which is to be expected from the RPG specialists that are Squaresoft), and, as always, an amazing plot line.When I bought my PS2, I bought this with it, being the huge fan that I am of the FF series. I must say that it blew me away from the start. The intro cinematic was amazing, and I also must say that the track was the best one in the game (I'm guessing the band that performs it was either Rammstein or Powerman 5000). It was just as I had hoped it to be. If you loved the FF saga, pick this one up; you will NOT be disappointed."
4,"I'm not an RPG player, but...","I found this game to be well worth the money. The graphics are beautiful, and the story line is quite good. If you don't like turn-based combat though, you might want to skip this one and wait around for Kingdom Hearts 2 (the release date is set for late 2004!)"
2,Boring,"The game is extremely boring with an unjustifiable number of cut-scenes. There is limited play sandwiched between cut-scenes of 10, 15 and 20 minutes in length, with no way of fast-forwarding through. It is incredibly boring. The gameplay is about 10 - 15 minutes at a stretch and then another long, boring cut-scene.If you like RPGs with constant moving and action, I don't recommend this game. I you can stand the limited play and long cut-scenes. This game is for you."
1,This Game Is Such A Disapointment,"I have been playing this game for aprox. 5 hours and in all of that time I think that there has been 40 mins. of game play. I hate this game , such a waste of 20 dollars."
1,[Stinky] Game,"This game really is not as great as people say it is. The graphics are okay. The plot of the story is really bad, though."
2,Great Graphics but game play stinks,"Squaresoft should have stopped with FF7. The game play in FFX lacks. If you loved the other FF games, DON""t buy this one."
2,Linear Garbage,"These new game consoles just don't get it!!! Rpg's of old were so entertaining and satisfying because you could spend hours exploring and goofing off. The storylines were there but you could take a break from it and do something else. This is not so in FFX. If I wanted just a movie I would watch FF:The Spirits Within.I tell you people, we've been robbed."
2,Not that great,"This game is not nearly as good as the other final fantasy games. the graphics a great but the story line is terrible. also, the level up system could use a lot of work. it is confusing at first and that makes it so that you have to work harder later to get better skills."
3,"Good Game, shallow story","The graphics in this game are incredible, the music is very good, and the details, such as waving grass and lighting are cool. I liked the battle system a lot; you are able to switch between characters while fighting. Unfortunately this game is horribly linear, there is no world map instead you follow a single path from beginning to end, with a few very predictable plot twists. The character development is very poor, only one character interested me, Auron. The other characters supposedly had shady pasts but they were either never explained or ended up pretty lame.I do recommend this game, however. The gameplay is very good and the graphics are awesome. Also, for first time rpg players the story might seem good, but I kept waiting for something to push the story to level of ffvii. It is a good game though."
2,Pokemon 3D?,"When I played Final Fantasy X, it felt like pokemon, but with really cool monsters, and a great plot. Now don't get me wrong, pokemon was a great game, but on PlayStation2, I expect a little better. So what do you do? Walk around unimaginative maps where you have absolutely no freedom to explore. Then, at any moment, the screen flashes, and a monster appears that you must battle with your own. The battles are fought entirely on boring, menus. When you kill a monster, you are bombarded by huge, meaningless numbers. The whole game just screams ""pokemon"". Yawn."
4,Why did they have to add in voice acting,"First off I'm a FF fan forever. But why oh why did they have to mix bad voice acting with horrible scripting. The acting wouldn't have been so horrible if the scripts were descent.And why did Brittney Spears have to contaminate something so good. It absolutely shocked me that she played Rikku.Other than the really really bad voices. The game is very nice graphicly. The battle system is great, and the leveling system is a little confusing at first ,but is really cool once you learn how to use it. The positive aspects of the game outweigh the bad.Just when you hear some of the things that say... it will make you angery.Overall if you a FF fan I suggest getting this game although most likely you will be dissapointed. Any other RPG fans get it and you probably won't notice a thing."
2,INSANE graphics... and that's all,If there is an RPG that is the polar opposite of Ephemeral Fantasia this one is it. Whereas in Ephemeral you have graphics that look as if they were made for a first generation PS1 game but a great story in FFX you have the best graphics I've ever seen and a story that seems to have been written by a chimp with a banana and a quill pen. The advancement system was nice and non linear which allowed for your heroes to become like demi gods by the end but some of the things you had to do for the legendary weapons were downright annoying and no fun at all. 1 star for the graphics and one star for the advancement system and that's it.
1,BAD GAME,"To start off, I think this is probly the worst game I have ever played. I thought the plot, characters, and gameplay sucked. I would NOT recomend this, because it can not keep up with Legendary games like the Resident Evil, Onimusha, and Devil May Cry series. Not only that, but I thought the whole Final Fantasy series was BAD. So buy a game worth buying, and get Resident Evil 3."
5,Awesome,"This is probably my favorite Final Fantasy game other than FF7.Voice acting is superb, story is engaging, graphic is awesome (for PS2)."
5,You must play this game!,"This game so additive and long to. The graphics are perfect, the whole plot of the game is good, and the gameplay is the best! The only problem i had was that you cant skip the videos (especially when you lose and see the video again and some of them are really long!) Therefore this is the best game I ever played."
3,"A ""lightweight"" RPG","This is a fairly good RPG. It's obvious from the dialogue and the story that the game was primarily designed to appeal to younger RPG players. If you like RPGs with a very good battle system, and a ""light"" story, then you will enjoy this game. I confess to having a preference for RPGs with a serious, mature story to go with a sound battle system.FFX is a good rpg for those who prefer a not-so-serious story and easy battles. This lacked intensity in all aspects. It's a good game to play if you just want to kill some time. But it is definitely not what you would call ""immersive"" or consuming. You can finish the game and forget about it the next day. It's that much of a lightweight.I actually enjoyed The Legend of Dragoon more than FFX. And don't even compare this game to Xenogears or Xenosaga. FFX just doesn't measure up. Again, this is a lighweight game for those who do not want to take their RPGs seriously."
4,Best-looking PS2 game!,"The FF-series have always been one of my favourites. The first thing you'll notice about this game are teh graphics which are really breathtaking. Square has pushed the possibilities of the PS2 farther than any other developer. The main difference between FFX and earlier games, is that FFX has real-time 3D graphics (instead of rendered backdrops). These graphics are so good I first thought I was seeing FMV. I am used to seeing great graphics on my 1,7 GHz PC with a Geforce3-card, but FFX rivals almost any PC-game!But this game also has some downsides. The voiceacting is very, very bad. The story is also a bit dissapointing.Still it's the best looking PS2 game and it's very addictive."
5,Best story ever on a Final Fantasy game,"I love the story, the minigames everything! Blitzball was a grand addition. I wish people would concentrate more on the story and gameplay rather than if the main character whined or not. Look at how many people gave it 5 stars compared to how many gave it 1 star. Go rent the game before you trust anybody's judgement. Don't even trust mine yet.Here are the ratings I'd give;Play Control- 9.0/10Since Squaresoft made a slightly different system thistime, it might be hard to understand it at first, but there were some great improvements.Graphics- 10.0/10This game shows PS2's mighty power to make fine graphics.Story- 10.0/10As I said. It has the best story of any Final Fantasy game.Satisfaction- 9.5/10Game Design- 11.0/10"
5,Final Fantasy X,"I only like to highlight keypoints when writing a review, for the simple reason of keeping it short and to the point. Graphics are simply THE best I have seen on the PS2. Music & sound are of course THE best on the PS2. Story is excellent...a big change from the castle/princess that most RPG's revolve around. Weapons & items are vast. Customization is easy and very well done. I have been with this series since FF I for the NES. I absolutely do NOT value any other series/game more than FF. This one just continues the Legend. Last but not least, the characters make the game. Their raw and unique emotions will grab you and take you on the journey with them. Long live Final Fantasy!"
5,Final Fantasy X - best in the series,"Final Fantasy X is by far the best game in the series for game play, graphics, plot development, and just about every aspect. This game is definitely one of the best games of all time, if not the best."
5,FINAL FANTASY ARE ALWAYS FINAL FANTASY !...,"In this final fantasy the square back to more realistic charecters that they used in FFVIII on playstation, but this graphics are the best in all FF hitory, ok this isn't what FFVII was to PSX but still one of the greatest FF in the past years, this game have a great batlle system, carismathic charecters and magnifican view, so if you are a RPG fan don't lose this for ""ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD""!..."
4,"Yeah, uhm........","Some of the best graphics I have ever seen and i great battle engine, but some of the dialogue makes me cringe."
5,drop dead at the graphics,"three words, best graphics ever this is the best graphics ive seen for rpgs. Tidus the main charachter looks like your every day best friend"
5,Best Final Fantasy Yet!,"The graphics, the story, the gameplay, this game has it all! I have never been too interested in RPG's, however this game rocks. This game is very addictive, watch out because time sneaks by when you play this game. I never get sick of it! This is a MUST OWN game, a reason to own the system alone. Buy this game, you will thank me later!"
5,Possibly the best game ever made!,"I received this game as a gift last year, I played it... And I loved it! It has some of Uematsu's best music and Nomura's best character designs. If you buy this game, you'll have just as much fun as I did."
4,Final Fantasy X,"I'm going to start by saying that I'm a die-hard FF lover, BUT FFX is a difficult game to love. I love the story, the characters, the graphics and the music, but the gameplay is ridiculous! Let's start with the random battles - there's one every 5 steps. I'm afraid to walk anywhere. I takes forever to get from one side of the field to the center. Also, a few of the bosses, like the Sanctuary Keeper, make you really want to rip your hair out. I get the boss down to 5000hp and it heals itself back up to 40,000. This is a very pretty game to have on your collection shelf, but I recommend getting a gameshark and the guide. You should only get this if you are prepared to spend hours and hours beating your head against a wall, or if you are a die-hard FF fan like me.P.S. The guide is beautiful!"
2,final fantasy x oh it is final alright,this game is fun but it get me lost all the time and when you fight you have to wait to take turns hiting your enemy but in other games you can just fight and fight with out waiting to take turns but overall the game is ok.
2,overrated,i got this game right when it came out thinking that it would be fun like all the others. i was wrong. FIrst of all there is no gameplay and the storylines been done. I didnt enjoy watching those boring text sequnces for hours on end. It gets points for graphics and voice acting though.
2,All in all a disappointment.,"So far I'm about ten hours into this game. Which isn't saying much. Most of the gameplay isn't really gameplay. On average, for every hour you play for about ten or fifteen minutes you can actually control what your party does. Everything else is just drawn out micro-cinemas. I am a big fan of all the other FF games but I think they went a little overboard on the cinematic aspect of this game. The graphics are amazing. That's true. I'm not trying to dispute that. It does however, take more than dazzeling graphics to make a game work. I think square sacrificed some of the finer points of gameplay to accomodate the stunning visuals.I would recomend this game to anyone because I am loyal to the series and it still may surprise me yet. Just be warned to be patient and be ready to put your controller down often. Also, up until this point the storyline has been relativley flat and dull."
2,Greatest Game I Whish I Never Had Played,"I have been a big fan of the Final Fantasy series so when X came out I immediately bought it. When I started playing the game and the characters actually spoke instead of just reading text, I went nuts. Then I saw the graphics for the cut scenes and almost cried it was that impressive. The game play was fun and fairly challenging. I thought this has got to be the best game ever, that is until the ending. After watching the ending I whish I could burn the entire memory of the game out of my head."
5,the BEST that Squaresoft has to offer,"My dad originally bought this game thinking it was X-2. But when he played it, he decided he didn't really like the turn-based battle system. But when I played it, I LOVED IT! It was just as good as Kingdom Heart ever was. Maybe even better. It presented me with some frustration when I encountered Seymour Flux, but that was easily solved with the help of a friend. The graphics and sound are wicked awesome, the storyline is really interesting. It's definitely an improvement from the N64 games where there was only music, no voices. If you want this game, buy it. You won't be sorry."
2,bad voice acting gets in the way,"ffX is all that, gravy graphics, cool characters, addictive gameplay and hours of fun; but that nasty voice acting has ruined the game!"
4,Too many movies,"My gosh I wanted a video game, not to sit through hours and hours of video. I'm glad that they brought in voice acting, but the cinematics were too much."
3,PARENTS BEWARE!!!!!,"Parents need to look out for this game!Mild language,sexual contents,violence,blood and gore.It shows innapropriate body parts.Do not buy this for your children.IT IS INNAPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE UNDER 18!I am very dissapointed with square this time!"
2,this game sucks,"boring, boring, boring, so, so, boring. I'm not even sure this is a game, there is no action and when there is action it's crap, for every minute of game play you have to sit through about 20min of a really bad movie.1) story sucks2) game play sucks [because there is none]3) characters suck4) cut scene's are DULL, IRRELEVANT AND YOU CAN'T SKIP THROUGH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wow never thought it would be like this!!!,This is one of the worst final fantasy games I have ever played. They should take out the special battle mode. I know its been on all of them but damb!!!
2,Should even carry the Final Fantasy name,"If you've ever played the final fantasy series this game is horrible. The storyline is poor, the game play is horrible as well. I'm trying to give a balanced review of this game but I can't think of anything that I've enjoyed out of this game. I've played most of the games in the final fantasy series and Final Fantasy X shouldn't be given the right to be a part of the series."
4,good graphics,It last square learned how to get out there wrong things but they still make it imagination more true
4,Great game with its flaws,"I got this game a couple of days ago and I've been playing it since. While this game is visually spectacular, it seems to be a little bit weak on game play (ex: long-winded transitions and awkward battles). Some character dialogues are cheesy and childish, and downright irritating during some portions of the game, but the storyline is pretty good. Even with its flaws, I would have to say that this game is still one of the best RPG games for PS2."
5,Finallly PS2 RPG Perfection,"This is the greatest Final Fantasy yet. It has every thing you could hope for in a RPG. Great Battles, an amazing storyline, tons of side quests! There is also blitzball a great game in itself. Just buy this game is the best advice i can give you. You will be sucked in in no time flat."
5,New to the FF series,"This review should be helpful to those not familiar with the FF series...New to both PS2 and the FF series, I was not sure what to expect from this game. After the first few hours I thought the game was going to be extremely boring--I was not expecting so much video and so little gameplay.BUT, after playing for a few hours, the story drew me in. Square has managed to create a game with characters that you actually connect emotionally with. The gameplay has gotten more exciting, and now I look forward to the videos. I never thought a game could offer a storyline so captivating.Overall, this is the best game I own for the PS2! I'm just not looking forward to finishing the game :( Then again, I think I'll go back and play FFIX and FFVIII."
5,The Single Greatest Game in Human History,"This game is an all out, mind blowing, visual masterpiece. The character detail is amazing, especially with the facial expressions during conversations. Auron, one of the characters, also has about the single greatest voiceovers i have ever heard. The only game that can even measure up to FFX is FF7, but the difference in greatness is so small, it is not measureable by conventional means. Battle Tactics are so crucial, and the Sphere Grid system is an entirely original system, which is very successful in the development of characters. Buy it NOW, dont read anymore, what are you doing! your still reading, One Click NOW!"
5,Great game... kind of,"This is one of the best RGP's available (grant it I have not played Chrono Trigger, FF7, FF8, FF9, Xenogears,ect.) I started FF7 for my PC but the graphics were so bad and the cut scenes were upside down so I decided to quit. FFX however has graphics that will blow you away. Also, for the first time in the series there is voice acting. The story line is impectable always keeping you coming back for more. The characters are well thought out and the enimes are corrupt as usual. However the final boss is easy, once you have the Magus Sisters and Anima everything is too (except the fiends in the monster arena). However, the mini games aren't so good and the replay value isn't much. Despite these things I think if you can be captivated by a story and the characters and play with a well thought out batlle system and level progression system for 60+ hours, the game deserves 5 stars.* For Christamas I hopefully will get FF8 and someday I may finish FF7."
5,Received,"In good condition, no scratches. The water soccer made this game with buying again for me, but your mileage may vary."
5,Epic!,"This is one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time, just behind FFVII. Incredible story line and engrossing gameplay, My time played has been stuck at 99 hours 99 minutes for months!"
1,Scratched,Received the game and it was so badly scratched that i couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. I don't even know how they thought it was passable.
4,Final Fantasy X - The Last Great Final Fantasy,Final Fantasy X was a great game... so long as you can ignore Tidus's continual whining and his obsession with his 'story.'It sets you into an interesting plot and puts faction against faction in an exciting story which rivals many of the stories of previous Final Fantasy's. It was also the first Final Fantasy to include talking so it added something new to the whole series.The character models were beautiful as well along with the music and the story was filled with a large selection of mini games to choose from. Generally it was a solid game and still would be fun to engage in today.Definitely worth playing if you haven't already.
3,Overrated,"I'm going to say the unthinkable....Final Fantasy games are overhyped and somewhat boring. The cut scenes in this game are incredible, some of the best graphics I've seen wedged in a game and I own an Xbox. However, I don't understand the mass appeal of these linear adventures. You don't control much of your destiny beyond fighting encounters. The story is ....horrible, I can't believe people are moved by a hackneyed tale about a water polo player. The ""romance"" is infantile, and definitely geared towards a young audience. Beyond the interesting skill system and inventory, I don't see any great RPG here, and the secret is that most every title in this series is in the same format. It gets 3 stars for eye candy, the rest is dullsville."
3,This is what we have been waiting for?,"Come on! I bought my PS2 for this game (not that I wouldn't have bought one anyway). I stared at the box letting the suspense build, I had my trusty strategy guide next to me, finally I put the game in. Woah! the characters talk? Cool. Check out these graphics! It's like I'm there. About halfway through the game... the voices are annoying! Shut up and just attack will you? Graphics still good! I don't understand the story, so I set the controller down and review. Ah yes! I understand what's going on. The story needless to say is not impressive. You don't feel for all the characters they way FF usually accomplishes it. It's hard to follow, and you have no choice but to continue. They don't let you take a breather to just run around and shop play some mini-games and so forth (although blitz ball is cool). If you love FF buy it, but don't expect too much. If you have never played an FF title, then don't start here. It certainly was a nice try though!"
3,Annoying!,the only thing is the graphics. but what sucks is the time. to get somewhere it takes time and the monsters are so annoying. But is a good game. The plot is good. But try Final Fantasy 7 it is the best.
4,This game was awsome!!!,"I loved it, the story line was great and the graphics where amazing. I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of RPGs. Oh, and Bob (Jennifer L Leininger) I have to dissagree with one thing you said. I for one loved Kingdom Hearts just as much as I loved this game. The graphics arn't as realalistic looking, but I wouldn't really say the graphics suck. They just had to base the characters on 2-D animation and not real life. I think they did a pretty awsome job. Let's face it, Square rocks when it comes to sweet looking graphics. I give both games 5 stars!"
5,A Sensation,"This game has amazing graphics with stunning music. The voices match the characters perfectly, and the faces show how the character feels along with bodie movements. The storie line has kept me in this game until the end. I love the battle systems, which are alot of fun, and the lengthy amount of time it takes to play the game builds up your antisipation. The only thing that I don't like is that the main character, Tidus, looks like a girl at some points. The little amount of blood and the use of only a few swear words makes the game good for people ages 8 and up. The game is also fun to watch and my sister watches it all the time when I play."
4,"The story is decent, the gameplay is awesome","FFX is very linear... its not like other FF's.It has a different (and way better) battle system, good graphics, good voice acting, a overall solid story, and probably the best sound in any FF game to date.But while it leaps ahead of the others, it still falls back. The praised ""sphere system"" isn't as great as it seems and the game is WAY to linear and short. There is virtually no sense of exploration and freedom in this game. Everything is very straightforward and you always know where you're going... very lame. That is not what an RPG is about.But overall, FFX is still a solid RPG. It's probably better then FF8 and 9, but it doesn't come close to FF7. However its definently worth buying. Just don't expect everything an RPG usually gives."
5,The Best Game Ever Made,"I've played the demo and eventhough its only about 20 min long, I'm addicted to it. This is a gaming experience no one should miss. X-box and Gamecube owners-buy a PS2 and get Final Fantasy X!"
3,a classic....one that i will play when i'm 50 years old,"Final Fantasy is a very popular sieries, and this installment not only held up the legacy, but made it twice as big! The first final fantasy game I got was ff tactics advance. I loved it from the start. then, my mom got me a playstation and I went out that same day and bought this game. I'ts awesome!(but i'm not the one to talk to. ive only played 2 final fantasy games in my life).this is my opinion:Graphics:5/5Storyline:4/5Battles:20000000/5I plan on getting ff XII the day it comes out.The only problem is that this game is really long, so i'ts almost impossible to beat it without a memory card.Overall, Squarenix should charge more then $20 for this legendary game!"
4,"The Game was great none the less, but it had its weak points","The game was great, the best final fantasy i have played yet. it was excellent graphic wise, and the battle system was better, seeing you could take as long as u wanted to choose what to do, unlike FFVIII. This game had its weak points though, one of them being the ending, i mean, that was so out of the blue, and it was very dissapointing in my opinion. I mean, come on, Tidus, a dream, Auron dies, and Seamour is no real challenge all throughout the game. I would buy the game, but be prepared, it can be a little off topic at points."
3,Well....,"My GOD this game is beautiful. But that is to be expected. Am I the only one who didn't like the idea of voice-overs? Why was everyone so excited to hear what they knew would be a bit (at least) off? I guess people are too lazy to just read. Jeez. Um, I don't own this game, but I played it for about 2 hours and it just didn't catch me like the other Final Fantasies. I just wasn't getting into it... It just seemed... (dare I say it) boring? I don't mind the tons of FMVs, I always like watching them, but this game just didn't catch me. Nope. I don't really like the characters either."
2,give me something to do..,"I'm only a couple of hours into the game, but so far I've been getting a little frustrated. FFX has way too many cut-scenes and I've been finding myself getting really bored and waiting for something to happen- something that involves ME taking part in the action! What's more disappointing, is that the game is very unchallenging. Maybe I'm not far enough into the game yet, but so far it seems I've been babied in the fighting sequences. There's constantly someone telling me the best strategies of beating the bosses, and so far I've had no trouble staying alive. The graphics never cease to amaze me, and the fighting sequences are absolutely astounding. It's a very entertaining game. This is my first PS2 game, and it's been well worth the money. However, this game probably isn't for you if you want to always be on the move."
2,Kind of a let down,"I hate to say it, because I was really excited about this game's release, but Final Fantasy 10 was kind of a let down. Final Fantasy 9 got me in kind of a light hearted mood, and this game is anything but light hearted. (For instance, don't look for a Hollywood ending!)However, die hard fans will probably enjoy the overall experience. You will find yourself confused sometimes (but we FF fans are used to that, right?) and depressed at others. But what was unforgivable to me was seeing as it took me 70 hours to beat, I was really hoping for a much better (longer? happier? You name it!) ending.But really, if you aren't looking for an uplifting game, but rather a dramatic, almost movie like experience (with interruptions in which you battle monsters) go for it."
2,OK Game,"First let me say this, FFX does not live up to FF7. Much of this game is simply watching. I am about 5 hours in and so far i have only played about 45 minutes, excluding battles. Also it is pretty much straight forward, there is always a map in the upperleft hand corner that always has a red arrow on it telling you where to go...not much required here. I get kind of bored of it after awhile, storyline is very interesting either. I think id rather go play ff7 again. Also another huge con is that you cannot skip through the scenes, this can get VERY tedious. Voice overs can get anoying sometimes, although it is a step up from stictly text games. Battles are good too, some times overly chalenging. I am really dissapointed in this game. The only reason im gonna finsih this game is because i bought it and dont want to waste the money. Definitley rent this game first!!!"
2,The worst Final Fantasy,"This Final Fantasy brought me to tears many times. Mostly, it was because of the horrible dialogue. The character's voices only added to the intense pain, which was already extreme due to Tidus' complete and utter stupidity throughout most of the game. What happened to the powerful leading roles like back on the SNES? I don't really like the new AP system, because it makes you constantly have to upgrade your guys, instead of automatically doing it for you at level up. It would be alright if maybe parties gained abilities doing that. Also, Kilmahri's character basically just ends in this system, forcing you to take him on another route no matter what. I also disliked how Aeons could only fight by themselves, unlike the others (Espers and what not) in the series. However, I am willing to give it 2 stars. 1 for the graphics, and 1 for the music, which is excellent throughout the game. I do not recommend this game to any real Final Fantasy fan."
1,Not a good game,"I bought this game at the full price, and discovered that all the hype was flat wrong. The cut scenes were amazing, and the character leveling it very interesting, but that is all. The game is very linear. There is NO decision making on the part of the gamer about where to go or what to do. The battle scenes are contrived and turn based, which I've always found boring and irritating. It takes no skill or imagination to manuver through this game. I wish I'd never bought this game."
1,This game just plain ......,"This game was so [sad and simple]compared to any Final Fantasy game! It had a terrible story line, gameplay was repetative It told you where to go instead of talking to people, the lack of world map and terrible no-strategy-required battle system, the...sphere grid was annoying and stupid, the ending sucked, there where about 3 looks for any weapon, the characters where [sad and simple] being that Tidus is such a wimp and a [nithing], and the ending was [so bad]. Blitzball was stupid. The only good thing was the graphics."
3,Final Fantasy is no longer Final Fantasy,"Let's face it, Final Fantasy is not what it used to be. Obviously many others diasgree as we can see from the many rave reviews. This game reminds of something teenage girls would love. Annoying, goofy, naive characters with nails-across-the-blackboard voice acting. Linear gameplay with no room to explore, moving basically from one overlong boring cutscene to the next. This really isn't an RPG, it's just a CGI movie with some RPG elements thrown in on the side. Cut-scenes can be great in a videogame if done well, but that isn't the case here. Even Metal Gear Solid 2, with it's outrageous cut-scenes was better. Graphics? Yes, spectacular. Beautiful. But that's about it. Blitzball was terrible too. Oh well, time to move on to other games, for me Final Fantasy is done. Let teenage girls enjoy future installments and I'll mind my business.3 stars for breakthrough graphics."
1,FFX .... Nothing New.,"With the release of Final Fantasy X I have to say I wasnt expecting much because I don't like any other Final Fantasy games, but this one isnt that bad. The graphics are top-notch. The story ... well it could be better, but it is somewhat interesting. The gameplay is the same as EVERY OTHER Final Fantasy game which is the bad thing here. Maybe with Final Fantasy XI being multi-platform and online Circlesoft could do better. If your looking for a really good game check out Phantasy Star Online."
1,Final Fantasy BITES!!!!!! (not even worth 1 star),"Listen, The grafics are OUT OF THIS WORLD BUT all the game is is grafics. you move 2 inches, the ps2 takes over for an hour then you finaly get youre character back than you move another 2 inches and vwala another stupid little thing to watch. bascliy it is an expensive game that you barly even play so dont be like me and get all excited about it and wast $... on it!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You know I really liked ff#12 but take my advice don't buy this game I mean you don't even get to move the guy you are playing as and the only time you get to move around is when you are swimming. the part I am stuck on is ok i am swimming in the water and then theese whales start atacking me ok i deafeat them and then it just takes back to swimming and there is NO way I can go back on dry land.
1,"FFX, a waste of 60 hours.","Ok, let me be the first to say this game is a waste of time. I not only wasted [money] on this game, but I also wasted 60 hours of my life with it. I spent a good 10+ hours TRYING to get the extra ""Sidequest"" stuff, but only to result with jack to show for it.I then got tired of all these ridiculous sidequests and just ended up facing Sin. Beating Sin, I viewed the end which isn't very satisfying one bit. WOW, spending another 5 minutes listening to ""Suteki Da Na"" Which is also very annoying..."
5,More fantastic fun from Squaresoft,"This first Final Fantasy game for the P2 lives up to its predecessors and then passes them. The story centres on Tidus, a star blitzball player, who is transported a thousand years into the future. His aim is to find out why he is there and if there is anyway back for him.As with all of the FF games, he travels through different lands while joining up with various people who will join him on his quest. There are a multitude of side quests to keep your interest going, such as learning to play blitzball, chocobo racing etc and there's a great variety of monsters to defeat. One tiny criticism is that the fights are still turn based but that aside, the rest of the game is so good that it doesn't really matter."
1,Be patient and wait for a real reprint,"This reprint of the classic set of works The Iconograpy of Manhattan Island (1915-1928) is a shoddy product. The publisher responsible of the reprint did not bother to tell his crew to open folded maps. They just photocopied the closed pages, so often all you see is a vertical black stripe. Also, where the original picture in the Phelps Stokes volumes sometimes covers two pages, this book cuts the picture in two, prints the halves on two separate pages and leaves out a wide sliver in the middle. Anyone seeing this reprint who is also familiar with the original is gasping for air. If I.N. Phelps Stokes had ever seen what was done to his work he would turn in his grave. So let us hope that one day there will be a worthy, high quality reprint of the Phelps Stokes title, but for now one is advised not to waste money on this one."
2,The very fundamentals,"On my search for a textbook on ""Electricity and Magnetism"" I came acrossthis work of L. Loeb and bought it without inspecting it.Firstly, the contents: It is a bit strange that Loebstarts with magnetism instead of electricity. Before the student has anotion of electrons and charges in general, he has to get aquainted tothe idea of current, i.e. moving charges. Furthermore, since this bookis quite old, the described experiments are a bit outdated, althoughthere are some interesting, forgotten methods described.Secondly, the printing quality: As the foreword says, this book isproduced in mimeographic form. Many pages are in really bad conditionand partially impossible to decipher.As a result: This book is, in my humble opinion, not feasableto be used as a textbook. For those who like antique books,it is a nice and pricy copy."
4,science fiction,I thought this series was a good read and enjoyed the three main books a lot.....I think the first book is perhaps the best in the series.
1,"NOT RECOMMENDED (Yes, history indeed repeats itself.)","This is simply a cut-and-paste concoction of mere leftovers (as in ""table scraps"") from an earlier project titled ""Calumet: Copper Country Metropolis.""The former book was intended as a ""beginner's guide"" to Calumet history, for greenhorns.So if you've devoured that (or something similar) you can skip past ""Jack the Hugger"" and move on to more professional, original works by the likes of Steve Lehto and/or Peter Oikarinen, each of whom will take you on interesting, incredible journeys through the backwoods & backyards of Keweenaw history.The proof, as they say, is in the puddin'."
3,Moeller marine electric fuel tank sending unit,This unit is very hard to calibrate. It must be put in and taken out several times to get the correct level before tightening the screws. The float does not float until several gallons of fuel are present so when showing empty there is still a bunch of unused fuel.
1,WRONG DESCRIPTION,I gave this a 1 star because the description is wrong. This fits a minimum depth of 12 inches NOT 6 inches. Moeller does make one for a minimum 6 inches with a return. It is part # 035789-10
4,Good.,"This product is great and works fine. It is actually fun to type using this keyboard. The keys do not make a lot of noise when you type. The only problem is that the "" @ "" is put somewhere else and I don't know where the backslash symbols is."
5,satisfied customer,we ordered our new keyboard and got it in less time then they actually showed for it so we are very pleased with the service and the product
1,"Great book, Terribler narrator","What a marvelous novel. Perhaps not as good as Tinker Tailor... but few books are, even by Carre. The reason I gave this recording such a low rating is that I cannot STAND the narrator's delivery or voice. He reads the book as if perusing a last weeks newspaper-- no sense of pace, long pauses between the sentences. And that appalling voice! Dry and rasping like a used sandpaper but at same time rather effete! Dreadful.Unfortunately, the narrator Frederick Davidson is used on a lot of British audio recordings. I had to return his P.G. Wodehouse recordings for the above-mentioned reasons.For those who agree I am providing link to same title but with a different and better narrator.The Honourable Schoolboy: A BBC Full-Cast Radio Drama (BBC Radio Series)"
5,Another great George Smiley novel,"I've been a huge fan of the BBC television movies made of ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" & ""Smiley's People"". I watch them 3 or 4 times a year. The Honourable Schoolboy falls between the above titles in time, and has as the main character Jerry Westerby, who was fired along with Smiley in ""Tinker....."" He is called back into action here and turns out to be an experienced agent who gives it all up for love. Mr. le Carre has done a fine job of research in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong and has a grasp of the secret world and those that inhabit it. I would love to see this made into a film."
3,Meh,"I read this because it was book 2 of the Karla Trilogy, but liked 1 (Tailor Tinker...etc) and 3 (Smiley's People) better. However, still a pretty good read."
4,40 year old novel holds up well,"Even though this second book in the Smiley trilogy was written 40 years ago, it is still a riveting and suspenseful story of Cold War espionage. In some ways, with the advantage of hindsight, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the transformation of China into an economic power, and the end of the Cold War, the book serves as a useful reminder of what the world was like in the mid-1970s. Le Carre's plot, as always, is complex, his characters compelling, and the deliberative pace (matching George Smiley's personality and work method) is captivating. The reader is drawn into a many-layered and intricate web that only slowly reveals itself as the story moves toward its ending climax. I did not read this book when it first came out, but as a look back at the world as it was, it is fascinating."
4,Lengthy but worthwhile,"The story is as cerebral as Tinker, Tailor, and perhaps more ambitious, but I thought easier to follow and of course he doesn't prostitute himself to the Clean Ending at the expensive of realism. It's an adequate successor and continues the tradition of highbrow espionage from JLC in that it's more about how these people are changed by this work than it is about dead letter boxes and tradecraft. If you've taken the time to research it to the point that you're reading this review, you should read the book. However, if you are looking for more immediately digestible thrills, look into Frederick Forsyth."
5,Truly excellent,"This is not only the best by le Carre, it is also one of the best written, most entrancingly hypnotic books I've ever read. Yes, it's about spies (boring, boring?) and foreign lands (of which we know little - and care less?), and it's quite long and pretty difficult, but I think it's great literature. I've re-read it many times, over the last fifteen (?) years. My teenage son read it aloud to his girlfriend during a prolonged and poverty stricken stay in Mexico. They did have to re-start it a couple of times, but told me that it was ultimately worth it."
1,"Long winded, disjointed and confusing","I have read several of LeCarre's books and enjoyed most of them but this is, by far, the worse! He usually pieces things together as he goes but this book is so confusing and disjointed that I didn't finish it."
5,First Rate Entertainment,"Le Carre wrote lots of spy novels, but look no further: this one is his masterpiece. The horrors of Cold War espionage - deception, blackmail, torture and murder - are all here, along with one of the most unlikely love stories anywhere. The reader is slowly and relentlessly drawn in as loyalties are gradually stretched beyond the breaking point.At the center of it all: Jerry Westerby - the unforgettable war correspondent/spy whose choices lead the reader to a place where we don't know who to root for anymore.Le Carre's descriptions of Hong Kong, Tuscany, London and Vientiane offer an evocative portrait of the mid-1970's, but it's the moral ambiguities of his shadow warriors and the choices they face - those are what keep you turning the pages.Highest recommendation. A deeply satisfying, entertaining and thought-provoking novel."
4,Honourable Spy,"""The Honourable Schoolboy"" is my first John Le Carre novel. It immediately brought to mind Graham Greene's, ""The Quiet American"" and the British miniseries, 'The Sandbaggers', by Yorkshire Television or Channel 4, starring a subdued and laconic Roy Marsden. No James Bond in sight!Like another English novelist who I recall, John Fowles; Le Carre must certainly be forgiven for his occasional minor literary flaws for the fact that his overall observational skills and plot development are exceptional. I'm not a spy novel enthusiast, per se, but the lives of George Smiley, his Circus and Whitehall associates, the ambivalent Jerry Westerby, Liesa, Drake & Nelson Ko, Luke, ... are depicted in a way that makes the reader care about their fate. The climax in Hong Kong is exceptional."
3,Okay but not his best work,"Lack of focus on plot and characters. Slowed down with too much page-filling junk, like wasting an entire page or more describing the interior of an airplane. Maybe it was too hard for Le Carre to follow up on his excellent ""Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."
2,Incredibly dull book by an incredibly good author,"I love John Le Carré's writing. ""Smiley's People"" has gone on my list of all-time favorite books. So I snatched up ""The Honourable Schoolboy"" eagerly at the library, plunged into it, and ran out of steam about a third of the way into it. Jerry Westerby's quest all over East Asia for not even he knew what and his bull-headed stupidity all the way through bored and frustrated me. I loved the sections about George Smiley's slow, careful investigation in England, but the writing style that worked so well in the England sections just got boring in Hong Kong and Laos. Le Carré said he wished he'd kept Smiley out of the book because he detracted attention away from the main character, Westerby. That's only because Westerby, after a promising beginning, became such a dull and muddy-mettled wanderer that I longed for him to go away and for fascinating, clever Smiley to come back.Thus far this is the only Le Carré book I have not enjoyed."
2,Very disappointing,I've read a number of LeCarre novels (most of the Smiley series) and this one was a fight to get through. A very boring roller coaster ride with a plot basis that simply is not believable. In my mind LeCarre does a very poor job of getting the reader to give a damn about the main character or any of his acquaintances in East Asia. I kept telling myself it would get better and it never did.
1,A real bore,I b ought the book because I wanted to read the trilogy. I could barely plow through this one. It's kept me from reading the next one. Maybe they should make a movie.
2,Good for learning colors in English!,"I am trying to teach my children a little Spanish- and since most Dora books have Spanish, I assumed this book would have both English and Spanish words for the colors. So, I just wrote the Spanish color names into the book."
5,Really Cute Book...,"I really like this book despite some of the other reviews. No, there's no Spanish words in the book, but it doesn't bother me because I took four years of Spanish and while I don't remember much, I do remember the colors. My 18 month old daughter loves the book because she loves anything Dora related. I'm trying to teach her colors and thought a Dora book might help. It is a little bigger than most board books; it's the same size of Baby Einstein's Baby Mozart book, but she has no problems with it. I think it's a good start for learning colors."
4,Stellar! (After the first 41 pages),"Having read all of P.J. O'Rourke's books, I can safely say that this was one of my favorites. Save for the first 41 pages, I was thoroughly entertained and stayed up 'til the wee hours giggling like a mad squirrel. Rip the first chapter out and it's a five-star read."
3,"Despite a slow start, P.J. O'Rourke is as funny as ever.","Just as the 1960's apparently exists in the drug-saturated memory of Mr. O'Rourke, his recollections ramble on like a man on a melancholy trip down Memory Lane, joint in hand. However, once O'Rourke pulls himself into the 1980's, the book becomes the typical yet uproarious wit which made O'Rourke the present-day Will Rogers. His observations on his road trips make even Mexico sound like an enjoyable place. Despite the slow start, this book must take it's place on the shelf next to ""Give War a Chance,"" etc."
5,Between myth and novel,"I loved this book and can't wait to read Olson's next book! I liked the feeling of northern european mythology in a modern novel format. The thrilling plot, intensified by myth, kept me reading late into the night. The actions taking place felt important, not just for the characters but also for my self. It is not just an allegory of some particular situation, it's more universal, it's a story to enrich life."
1,Too predictable,"This is the first Kaminsky book I've read, and I can't say that I'm impressed. A midget who played a munchkin in the Wizard of Oz is found dead on the set of the movie and Toby Peters must find the killer. Although it sounds semi-interesting, I found it hard to get into. The characters were very dull, and it was hard to envision such a blockhead as Toby Peters interviewing the likes of Judy Garland and Clark Gable. And most annoying of all, to me it was much too obvious who the killer was. I think the only good thing about this book is that it is only 171 pages long!"
3,Could have been better...,"I didn't expect much when I bought this CD at Wal-Mart. The quality wasn't as I had expected...some songs are louder than others...nothing is ""remastered"" as it should be.Here is the playlist since Amazon didn't include it.1) Hey Bartender - Johnny Lee2) Broken Promises - Willie Nelson3) Chug-A-Lug - Roger Miller4) I'm The Only Hell My Momma Ever Raised - Johnny Paycheck5) Don't Think Twice, It's Alright - Waylon Jennings6) Wasted Days and Wasted Nights - Freddy Fender7) Three Hearts In A Tangle - Roy Drusky8) Who Shot Sam - George Jones9) Almost Persuaded - David Houston10) The Fightin' Side Of Me - Merle Haggard11) Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On - Mel McDaniel12) I Got Mexico - Eddy Raven"
5,Yo La Tengo meets Sonic Youth fantastic!,"I first caught this band opening for Mike Watt in Portland about a year ago. I've been a covert ever since. This album is pop music at it's best. You get just enough of everything. ""Classical Composer"" is awesome. Rock on!"
4,Great product!,"This bag is just what I was expecting. It has a moderate size, a side pocket to put in the keys or anything that small, and a front pocket to put in a wallet or things you need at your reach.The material is great, and the strap is long enough for almost everyone.I took it on a two-day trip to the country, and I was able to fit all the personal care objects I needed. It is very durable and resitant. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it gets dirty very easily, other than that I would strongly recommend this bag."
4,The Cell Review,"The book was in advertised condition, and the seller was able to get it to me in a timely fashion."
4,A Good Tale Well Told,"If you enjoyed ""The Professor and the Madman"", this book might just be your cup of tea. In both books, the central character becomes schizophrenic. In ""The Professor and the Madman"", he's an American officer in London. In ""The Question of Hu"", he's an assistant to a Jesuit scholar in France. This is a comparatively thin book, but it contains many threads: infighting among Jesuits, the Catholic missionary strategy in China in the 18th century, culture shock, treatment of the mentally ill, fidelity, circumstances in 18th century Paris and Canton, and careerism, among others. This is an engaging story well told."
2,could be better,"for the price this mirror serves its purpose. I had to use a different wiring solution to tap into the factory wire harness because the one that came with the kit was bulky and awkward. Its still hanging, i'm happy with it."
2,Pioneer 578 - not for DVD-A,"I picked up a unit from Best Buy, and it worked swell for about 26 days.For some unknown reason, the audio playing from DVD-Audio discs suddenly sounded as if was coming from underwater. The odd audio only occurred in 5.1. When playing the same DVD-A discs in stereo, the audio sounded normal.5.1 SACD discs played without a problem, as did DVD-Video discs. From some of the other reviews, it appears there are those that didn't experience any problems.If you desire to purchase this unit, I'd advise buying it locally in case you need to return it if turns out to be defective. I had to return mine and ended up purchasing a Sony DVD/SACD changer instead."
2,Pioneer 578 - not for SACD,I bought one at Best Buy and picked out a number of SACD and DVD-Audio disc to take home and try out the new machine. Well on a few of the disc it was very nice but on some there was a horrible popping on some tracks (not just between them). I went back to the store where they had the machine set up as a demo and I was surprised that it didn't have the same problem. I then realized that they had it playing through 2-channel and had not used the 5.1. When set to 5.1 it had the very same problem. I'll be taking it back and saving some more money for the Denon.
2,Doesn't deliver SACD quality playback,"I bought this after reading a review that it sounded about as good as a Denon SACD player with 4x the price. However, I find it to be unacceptable as an audiophile SACD player. I did an A/B comparison with my 3 year old Sony DVP-NS500V player (which sadly is not now recognizing the SACD layer on most new Hybrid SACD/CD discs!). The difference is decisive. With the Pioneer you cannot hear the ""space"" of the hall which you can hear with the Sony. And sibilants sound hissy and sandy on the Pioneer, while they sound airy on the Sony. In short, it suffers the defects of CD sound. I have read that some SACD universal players convert the DSD signal to 192 KHz PCM streams upon which they do D/A conversion. I suspect this is one of them. There ought to be some regulation requiring the disclosure of such ""cheats"". Caveat emptor. Don't buy this as an SACD player because it doesn't deliver SACD quality sound."
5,This Kicks!!!,"I am 12. I have Half-Life. It's the best game I ever played. I just bought this game, and it's just as good as the original. Half-Life is the best game ever made."
5,"excellent in price i paid,i am happy.","nothing wrong in 139.00 i am so happy,this was my 3rd purchase in gps,i like this one better than mio and tomtom one. less POI,but its ok.dose job in 139 which its suppose to do>>>"
4,Now if I can only find my car!,"This is is the 1st gps I've ever used. It's fairly simple to use and gives accurate instructions(so far, I've only used it a few times)It's easy to see during dalight hoursand better at night.The voice is clear and legible. The volume however,is a little short and it makes it difficult to hear in a rainstorm.Overall I think it's agreat value at $139.99."
2,Hardware Issues,"What seems to be an excellent value for money is dogged by quality problems and hardware issues.Mine worked flawlessly for a week when I took it on a trip across 3 states NY, NJ, and PA. Super fast lock on to Satellite signals and fast re-routing etc. with text-to-speech i.e. street names clearly pronounced. Without any reason it started crashing every now and then and wouldn't startup anymore. Hope they get their product quality issues under control."
1,hardware and software failure,1) tip of the 12V power plug is broken when I open the box. Why quality control did not catch it before ship it out?2) the GPS software freezed up twice during my 3 hours long trip. Each freeze requires multiple hard resets to clear. each hard reset take 3-5 min to complete. I don't think the risk and I took and my time wasted with HGPS35 worth the money I saved.
2,Buggy software bogs down this unit,"While the price I paid (~$140) seemed phenomenal for a text-to-speech GPS unit, the unit was essentially nonfunctional. Quality control for this unit seems abysmal. It crashed nearly each time I tried to use it, and it hung while it was supposed to be calculating the route. I am reasonably confident that with some software tweaking, this will prove to be a pretty good unit, as is it isn't a good unit for someone expecting a GPS that will be ready to roll as soon as they receive it.Given that it was for my wife, I returned it and got her a TomTom One, which is much more plug-and-play."
1,Great when it was working,"I bought this in August 2007 and it worked great for a few months. Then suddenly one day, it did not boot up any more. No matter what I did, it was stuck in the ""Loading..."" screen. The manufacturer's policy is that any defective unit must be returned to the seller for repair. They did (probably still do) offer customers to swap their defective model with their latest model for $135. I could not find review or customer experience with their latest model and finally decided to go with a Garmin. With prices coming down so much recently, there is no reason to go for an unreliable brand."
1,stuck on the loading screen,"well, it worked for just long enough to get past the warranty period, now it is stuck on the loading screen. This is way too common for this model (do a google search) Just stay away from nextar, many reports of failing nextar products on the web.:edit, I just thought I would add that after I spoke to Nextar CS they sent me a newer model as a replacement, even though I was beyond the warranty period. So far the new one has worked fine, so I thought it was worth it to update my review."
2,Amazon retread,"Amazon sold this clearly used product as new, and when I complained, I was told that If unhappy, I could return it and one of you other fine people would probably receive this item as new when it really wasn't. I'm considering filing complaints against Amazon for this transaction. Why don't I return it? Amazon said it couldn't replace it with a real new GPS, and since I've purchased several companion items through Ebay, those companion items would be a total loss. Thanks Amazon for negotiating a fair settlement (NOT)! I'm very leery of purchasing anything similar through Amazon and have relayed my experience to my family, friends and fellow coworkers. BUYERS BEWARE!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"I have been fairly impressed with this unit although a lot of other people from [...] are reporting problems such as it crashing. The map needs to be updated and they did say a free update should be out soon. For my city (Austin, TX), it does not show the newest tollroads and many of the points of interest are outdated but for the ones that are listed, it even has their phone number. It is very quick to acquire a signal and start tracking. At $155 (some people even got it cheaper) I would say it's a great deal, but don't expect everything. All the music (MP3's) have to be saved onto an SD card (2 GB is ok) and the play from there."
1,Rush job,"Regrettably there were too many errors in this book. And when the action scenes were occurring, it read like a screen script instead of a novel. While it was set in Detroit, there was little mention of the city, places in the city or the culture and personality of this city. I would prefer a fictional city/town if it has no bearing on the story and Detroit had no bearing on this story. Not Sylvia's best work by far."
4,"Good, but somewhat disappointed.","Don't be turned off from buying this book. I consider it a fine addition. I relate better to the simple, common names of mushrooms. Not the scientific names. Also, I found some huge mushrooms in my pasture identified as ""horse mushrooms"" elsewhere. I could find no mention of them in this book and they are supposed to be excellent for eating. If I were a novice, I would add this book but not rely on it for my sole information source. Never assume anything concerning wild mushrooms. Do your research and proceed with extreme care."
4,A great power pop CD from Atlanta's best unsigned band.,This Is Rocket Science is Glass Candle Grenade's second CD and represents the growth this band has achieved in the last few years. They are a tight band with an amazing female vocalist.
5,Rip-Off,"I just bought this at Target for $2.19.But hey, at least you're eligible for FREE Super Saving Shipping!!!"
2,textbook-like,"This book seems like they took a chapter out of a Spanish language textbook and made it a board book. Like other books in this series, it has very busy pages with everything labeled. There isn't much context, there isn't much to read or a story. It doesn't keep my daughter's attention at all. It's boring to both of us, so I doubt we'll be able to learn much from it!"
1,Junk,"Low quality.Self Hand packed.No Producer,No ""Best Before"" Date,No Nutrition Fact,INGREDIENTS Contains ""SULPHITES"""
3,"okay, but...","Anything coming out of China, I imagine, will be a failure in the ingredients and proper listings categories... (not to mention their proficiency in English, these jujubes are of course, sweetened, not ""sweeten"")... however, though the box says piited and stone free... watch your molars... though large and tasty many have whole pits or partial ones. In one box we found a least 50% with full or partial pit. Great if you want to grow your own tree... not so great if you break a tooth. Maybe the manufacturer should add the following disclaimer to the box: ""Guarding teeth when go bitey on this yum jujube sweet treet... we not legal responsibility to your dentist."""
1,Very bad,"1. The quality is very bad!!!2. Just a small amout of jujube, not worth the money3. Taste AWFUL4. You can buy it at lotus"
4,Listen to the Reviews,"The last two reviewers stated it perfectly. This book is good, but I wish it had more character development and moral trials, stuff like that. ""Sword of the Land"" and ""Blood of the Land"" were amazing books,with Sword of the Land being one of my favorite novels, so I had high hopes for ""Daughter of the Desert."" Though not as spectacular as I expected, it's still a page-turner, and I will most definitely read the sequel as soon as it comes out."
3,OK book but there may not be a sequel so beware,"Ok book with a strong heroine which is what I enjoy, but there may never be a sequel so don't invest your energy in starting something with no conclusion."
2,Clumsy and Awkward,"I loved Blood/Land and Sword/Land, so I was excited to read this one. It's not nearly up to their standard. It's very poorly written; she explains to you all the emotions of each character, never showing them. Far too much ""Deus ex machina"" magic. It's clumsy, plodding, and poorly-written. I can only imagine her editor sent it into print because the first two books sold well; this one isn't worth the effort to read, and her editor ought to have stopped it from going to press in its present condition."
3,light entertainment,"""Daughter of the Desert"" is a fantasy novel set in a mystical variant of the middle ages -- swords & sorcery & a strong class system. F--, a sheltered young lady, discovers magical powers that she dare not reveal. Prince E--'s life is torn assunder by trechery and assasination. Meanwhile F-- uncovers deadly secrets in her upper-class family and flees, disguised as a lower-class citizen. Meeting by chance, E-- and F-- together flee for a legendary city.Altogether, this book is fun, light hearted and entertaining. It wasn't great, but no terrible flaws, no lengthy moral messages, no dark passages, no questionable topics. Just a pleasant read, suitable for a lazy afternoon."
1,It's retarded!,I usually think some farts are funny but this CD is just fake farts. I know what a fart sounds like and it seems like some dude just made stupid fart sounds and put it on a CD which is a waste of money to buy. I'm smart enough to listen to samples instead of buying so I listened to them and most of them are fake farts and not funny. It's too pointless to think this CD is funny. These fart CD's should be banned!
1,SUCKS!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,It's just a bunch of phony sound effects that you could download free anywhere on the net. It's a total scam. I wasted my money and might put it on eBay or something to try and make something back. It's total garbage.
1,RIPOFF!! This thing sucks. Don't bother!!,This is nothing but amateur sound effects. Don't waste your money like we did. It's a total ripoff!
1,"Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka","is a well-written and engaging book but it is dangerously misinformed and misleading.For example, it repeats many of the clichés about the life and philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and, therefore, misunderstands the significance of both.There are many excellent studies of the lives and works of all four authors but there are even more lurid, novelistic studies which are nothing more than the projections and fantasies of the writers who compose them. This book is one of the latter, I'm afraid."
2,Overwhelmingly Christian Analysis,"The book is really a veiled homage to Christianity and criticism of the growing atheism in 1950's Europe, rather than an objective critique upon four existentialist writers.The Kafka segment was even mildly offensive, as the author implied that it was Kafka's Judaism which provoked his misery and his books were therefore products of godlessness.The only useful information I gathered was an introduction to Kierkegaard's zealous Christian beliefs and perhaps a grain of insight into Dostoevsky's vacillation between Christian ideologies.I must admit that, in a fit of disappointment, I considered that the author of the book should be banned from writing any further upon European exhistentialists and be made to burn every copy of all published works copiously by hand."
2,Sometimes Hubben only sees the surface,"My main problem with this book is Hubben's inability to see the true depth of any of the men he portrays. Although I was attracted to the book mainly because of my interest in Kierkegaard and Dostoyesvsky, I thought Hubben managed to gloss over much of Kierkegaard's philosophy. Furthermore, he seems to rely a great deal on a blind ""classical"" interpretation of the ideas that these men have, so he doesn't capably manage to give much new information. All and all, I think it has the potential to be a good book -- but it needs to be rewritten and substantiated."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed by this work and even stopped reading it after the section on Nietzsche, which is the third 'writer' discussed in the book. While the overview and topic of the book seemed like a good idea I found it significantly lacking. The writer is strongly biased towards one interpretation and the section on Nietzsche's writings contained many egregious errors. Most of the conclusions in the book were almost forced and author's opinion usually stood without any objective merit. I believe there are better books on these fine, talented individuals that you can spend your money on. Please keep in mind that this book was originally writen in the 1950's and this plays into the author's views, being focused highly on WWII and Religion. While I did gain a minute amount of insight into the author's views on these writers it is not enough for me to give it 2 stars."
3,Air Tool Kit,"I didn't see anywhere in the order that this was a used product. I may be mistaken, however; it does seem used. Grease stains on the ratchet. Otherwise, the shipping was very fast and I am pleased with it. Thanks."
4,My daughter loves this toy,"I picked up this toy at a neighbor's garage sale last summer and we have definitely gotten our money's worth out of it. My daughter loves it.I like that the faces can be used to talk about emotions with a child. I also like that all of the pieces fit in the small box (with some careful arranging).The toy is limited in that there is only space to make one bear at a time. It also comes with a decent amount of small pieces (which can be easily scattered/lost).We got the Melissa and Doug Wooden Bear Family for my daughter's birthday and I like that set a little more because there are more bears to make. I would recommend checking out the bear family if you are interested in this bear because for a few more dollars, you get three bears to dress which provides a lot more possibilities (and a lot more pieces)."
2,Flawed Design and Made in China,"I like the idea behind this toy, and my 2-yr-old daughter enjoys playing with it. The eighteen pieces are consistently smoothly-cut and the images on them are nice enough. However, I am quite unhappy with the fact that there are splinters on the bottom of the box. That is unacceptable for a children's toy--parents shouldn't have to sandpaper down the edges of a toy down before they give it to their child. Also, the design of the box is not great because, as another reviewer already remarked, the lid doesn't close. It simply sits atop the toy, making the lid and the pieces inside easy to lose. Lastly, I am unhappy with the fact that this toy is made in China. I know Melissa and Doug has high standards, and according to a previous reviewer, they test their toys in their home office--but they can't test every toy they sell."
1,MADE IN CHINA!,Like everything I've received from Melissa and Doug this too is made in China. I thought I had done my research well but it looks like I have to buy more lead test kits. They are not a US toy manufacturer as I thought.
5,Melissa and Doug - High Quality Standards,"I see that some reviews talk about Melissa & Doug items made in china. I spoke with Melissa & Doug on this, ALL of their items are product tested in their home office before being sold. They have the highest quality controls - they are not a public giant company so they can adhere to their own higher standards.As for this toy, my daughter loves it. It is great to dress up the bear in so many different outfits!As usual, Melissa & Doug have outdone themselves again! :)"
5,Beary fun,My daughter has this toy and played with it quite a bit when she was 2-3yo. It is very well made and I like the fact that I never see Melissa and Doug toys on the recall list for lead paint or other safety issues.
5,"wow, it really works!","I didn't think a crystal could really give me anti-stink protection, but it really does. I love not wearing the traditional deodorants anymore. Even if I'm really sweating, I don't stink.I can't believe it really works!!!"
1,Rip Off Child's Army Costume,I highly recommend that a person looking for a child's army costume NOT purchase this product or from Brands on Sale. The costume is mis-sized and will not fit a small 7 year old boy. The return service is NOT prompt or friendly as promised by amazon and amazon's a-z guarantee is no good on an item that is mis-sized.
2,"Great, but.......","This is supposed to be great for toddlers to learn to deal with closures found on clothing. However, the individual pieces do not stay in place because they are not stuck to the board beneath them.This makes it frustrating for the child to use."
4,no crystal stair,"this book is a true gem. i was hook on it from the beginning although it started out slow. but the more i read, the more i related to every character in the book, even Toya's injury. being a man i have to admit, it even had its tear jerkers in it"
4,What a Good Book!,"What a wonderful book! This book is a turn-pager and everyone who has been in love or dealt with a ""baby daddy"" should have it. You definetly can relate to the sista's in this book. Melissa Manuel is an excellent author and will do very well on her next book."
5,EXCELLENT,"For an upcoming and new author, this book is one that all readers should own. It was just like the author was speaking to me. She lets us women know that we don't need a MAN to survive and we don't need the bagage that some men bring entering into new relationships. Women stop settling for less. It is very hard to be a SINGLE PARENT, but with or without a man's help don't these men know that women are strong and we will survive. Melissa this book was excellent. Stay strong and keep your head up."
2,Not as good as expected,"I was expecting this product to be GREAT since I read all good reviews about it. It actually was just ok, as any regular pharmacy product. It didn't improve my skin at all and in fact gave me a little breakout since it does have (or at least it feel like) oil.Don't spend this much $$ on it. AHAVA has waaaay better products for same/cheaper prices!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for something that would give me some info on these places. Instead it is just video (a lot of time lapse photography), some of which is pretty cool, with music playing in the background. There is no narration - you have to figure out on your own the location being shown. So if what you are after is something that is relaxing and beautiful to look at then you might find this enjoyable. If you are looking for something that is more informative, look elsewhere."
1,The worst product I've ever used,"This is by far the worst product I have ever used in my life (and I use a lot of products)! Not only did it not work, it actually had the OPPOSITE effect, my legs had such an adverse reaction to this product that I had to wear pants for days during the summer because the disgusting bumps and rash on my legs were so unsightly. I used this product as the directions suggested, felt a slight burning immediately after applying that I figured was normal, nothing too bad. A few hours later my legs were terribly itchy and red, and there were bumps all over that looked like bug bites. I had to use steroid cremes and cortizone for days before it went away. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone."
3,Music for Passiontide and Easter,"Great music, well performed... but the organ sound is a bit disappointing. The solo voices are very convincing but the tutti lacks in foundation: the only audible stops are mixtures and the lower pedal stops. The body of the sound is missing. The accoustics of St. George Episcopal Church is a bit dry. This music deserves a french symphonic instrument in a wealthy accoustics."
5,Great value!!!,"The Simmons Pro-Hunter is an amazing scope. Solid, steady, and deadly accurate! Aside from performance, the Simmons scope is a great value, as well. I took my first deer using this scope on my Ruger Super Redhawk .44 mag. It was a clean and deadly shot. Highly recommend this scope!"
4,It has good information,"This book is very helpful in that it has programs and nutrition advice but that really wasnt anything new. What I found helpful was that there is a chapter on increasing the intensity which has techniques like supersets, partial reps, negiatives and so on. It also has a chapter on supplements and what to use."
4,Module magic,"This book is an excellent companion to the class I took at Stitches West 2008. Clear and concise, it is illustrated with sketches and describe the pattern perfectly. Even is you have not taken such a class, it will suit perfectly in training you for your modular knitting."
5,Module Magic: Creative Projects to Knit One Block at a Time,"A brilliant book, the answer to take creativity one step further. The authors have done a brilliant job. Iam very pleased I purchased this book."
3,Module Magic,"I was hoping to build a sweater with blocks knitted from left over yarn but the styles in this book were not suitable for me--a 60+ knitter.Connie of Oak Harbor, WA"
2,"Crude, and not just in a good way.","No one is going to be reading this book for the prose style, but does it really have to be quite this bad? Despite an interesting premise and some well set-up scenes, Lia Anderssen's flat and repetitive prose makes the descriptions of the sex acts themselves about as arousing as instructions for self-assembly furniture. On the plus side, at least Laura seems to be having a good time."
4,Great album from some of The Bronx-boys...,"Well, this is a really great record, and if you like the first album from The Bronx you will not be dissapointed (The Drips & The Bronx shares 2 members, the singer and the guitarplayer). And if you can't wait for the new Bronx album, this makes for great listening in the meantime. That's not to say that this record isn't as good as The Bronx, I think they're about equal. Also, the song ""16,16, Six"" on this album could be one of the best songs ever. At least it's my favorite song in a long, long time... Check it out."
3,Very informative,"Narrated by Lenny Magill, this video is a series of clips showing some of the fastest pistol shooters in the world in competition. The clips are done at regular speed, slow motion, different angles and side by side to contrast different techniques. The common elements are pointed out, i.e. how little each shooter moves (economy of motion) when drawing from the holster.Although the description says 60 minutes of video, it is actually 47 minutes long with an additional 30 minutes of advertising for other titles at the end. The advertisements are long enough to be somewhat educational, but I would still prefer more of the topic on the cover instead of a relatively short segment followed by a video catalog.Overall this is a good video that is worthwhile if you want to see and hear how competitive shooters develop their speed. An added treat is a short clip of Bob Munden drawing and hitting his target in 0.13 seconds. You will have to rewind several times to believe it."
5,Love it!,And it didn't dry my hair out too much. At home highlights always do (for me). I'll use it again : )
4,Lila is down,Wow! This is the first album that I heard of Lila Downs. I was blown away. Her interpretations of the classics had me wanting more. If I have a slight criticism....the mixtec song sounded a bit out of place.
5,It tells about the real Dale Brown,"I loved this book. I knew Dale Brown as a friend of my family for as long as I can remember. In this book it shows everybody what Dale is really about. He is a person who is strong on his morals, a loving family member, and will do anything for anybody. I wish everybody had a little bit of Dale Brown in them it would make this world a better place."
5,No Vignetting on a 18mm 1.5 crop factor (Nikon DX),"I've used this on Nikon DX lens (18-55mm VR) and it does not show any vignetting at 18mm with a 77mm Hoya Slim UV filter (even on top of the 52mm filter on my lens!)18mm on a Nikon DX camera (with a 1.5x Nikon crop factor) is equivalent to 27mm on a full-frame 35mm camera.So obviously I'm happy but I wonder how this would look on a 35mm camera at 18mm. I can only attest that this works very well on my lens. I plan on getting a nice polarizer to use on all my lenses.The plastic build shouldn't deter you. It is very cheap and can easily be replaced if the ring is broken.Would I recommend this product? Absolutely, I think it's best to save and cut costs where necessary and invest the rest on a good technique (professional tripod, pro ball head, filters, use of mirror lock-up, cable/remote release).Hope this helps."
3,Standard step up adapter,Seems like a pretty typical step up adapter that you would get from an off brand. Does not feel cheap but it does not give you quite the precision feeling you get when you purchase from your cameras manufacturer.
4,Brings an often forgotten part of the NT to the fore.,"Moo's commentary certainly does a lot of good for the standing of these often forgotten books. His application to today is particularly good, with the attention to detail that you would expect from a scholar of his standing. It can be used as a great and accessible resource for anyone in ministry. Well worth the read - a highlight in an already promising series."
4,Good transaction,This was a good transaction. Shipping method a little slower than Amazon's lightening speed but within the time frame it was promised
4,A Great Contribution to Romans,"I did not give this volume a five star rating because of his monumental work in NICNT series. This, however, is one the best work in the NIVAC series.His movement from the text to the contemporary significance, is a staunch reminder of how the Scriptures should be handled. I say get book works if you can afford them."
2,Dinner Is Served,"This is a fine work for someone who knows little to start with, but for someone who wants to know, say, the proper way to hold a fish knife this is a complete waste of money. It is light and provides little information most well reared people don't already know."
3,"Wow, blast from the past!","My dad and I used this to experiment, back in the '70s -- '80s when I was 10-18. I still remember some recipes from those times: ribs hung in a hot oven, Star Anise Chicken. I actually found a copy in a used book store and picked up a copy. Some very nice basic techniques, although tastes have changed for many people (away from as much salt/sodium, and so on.)"
5,eye-opening,"I've worked at this university for many years, and walked past many of the buildings described in this book without really wondering what their stories were. This book opened my eyes to the treasures that have surrounded me. (I think of the old jazz standard ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"") Mr. Helfand's knowledge of the history of the campus is matched by the intelligence of his appreciation."
2,Poorly Made,I was excited when I first got these sunglasses because flip-up clip-ons are hard to find in the stores. They did fit the shape of my glasses and provided pretty good UV protection. They come in a nice case that protects the sunglasses themselves. The main problem I had was that the plastic that was applied to the clips to protect your glasses from getting scratched up quickly peeled away. Now I can't wear them without scratching my glasses. The clip-ons now sit in my car unused and are no doubt destined for the trash.
4,quality animal,"My son loves play animals and also camels, but we couldn't find any camels at our local store, so I ordered this online. We have a few other Schleich toys, and they are high quality. I think they will outlast my toddler."
5,For starters....,"For people who've never really experienced U2, this is posibly the best Cd you could buy. It was what got me started on being one of the biggest u2 fans ever. Some tracks most people should already know, but after getting to know all of them, you'll find yourself buying more and more of their albums......"
3,It's OK,"I was not as impressed with this product as I had hoped. The holes are very small and they get packed easily. I had to frequently stop and use a fork to get the potatoes out, or just rinse it under hot water. It was somewhat of a mess. I ended up getting out the hand mixer (which is why I bought this - to keep from having to use my hand mixer) to finish the job.I have since used it when making beans, to crush a few and thicken the mixture. For that, it's great. If you're looking for something to give you a rough or 'smashed' consistency, this is for you. If you're trying to create true 'mashed' potatoes, this will fall short of your expectations."
3,Masher,"I bought this to help extend the finish on our SS pots and pans, it helps prevent scratching. Not as good as the traditional steel mashers but it does the job with a little more effort."
3,Great history not enjoyable read,"This book was packed full of facts and history all from a strongly English perspective. I learned a lot, but it was like listening to text book, pretty dry, but informative."
2,a history text,"Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101. In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison."
3,A useful primer,"All along while reading it, I couldn't escape the feeling that each and every sentence could have been a newspaper headline at some time in some country. Recall that, before tabloid times, headlines used to represent complete sentences."
3,FABULOUS BUT NEW OPERATING SYSTEM LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY,"I can't say enough good things about the Compaq PA1. There's no bounce no skip, great quality. I listened to it while running 4.5 miles with beautiful results. So for problem free music-buy it. I purchased it when it very first came out with no regrets. Until now....I recently upgraded my Operating system to XP and find that I can't get Drivers for the PA1. Therefore all of the great music I now have I can't listen to on my pA1. I am torqued beyond belief. XP Imcompatibilities ... not only strand me for this but all my music recording products. I'll end up spending hundreds for the privledge of ""upgrading"" my system to XP. ..."
4,Excellent player for the price,"I have found only two negatives for this player; 1) The earplugs fall out when I jog, (and the reason I purchased the player was for jogging ..), and 2) The software included (RioPort Manager) MUST BE INSTALLED and USED to format the memory cards before they can be used. After that was done, I was able to use my Windows Media Player, which I prefer. (I couldn't find anything in the Windows Player allowing me to do this .. if anyone knows of a way, I would appreciate a note...)"
1,"Nice design, yet a terrible pain","I like the fact that the unit is so small and light, and using it to listen to MP3s is a breeze. However, I highly recommend against buying this player for these reasons:A) While I was able to get the software running ok under Windows 98, getting the player to communicate under Win XP is seemingly impossible.B) Compaq customer support is useless. I've sent multiple emails regarding my problems with the unit and have gotten no reply from them, period.C) The RioPort software is very weak in features, and is poorly designed. To my knowledge the player only works with RioPort software.D) The MMC memory is expensive."
2,Nice player - but lousy software!,If only there were a way to avoid using Rioport to load songs onto the player. I wouldn't have bought it had I known what a pain it was... The smartmedia cards used are also a dead end - there won't be anything bigger and technology has passed them by. There'll be something along the lines of the iPod coming soon!
3,Can't read the media without the player,"Up until today, I loved the iPaq. I had the same issues with the software as everyone else, but lived with it. Sometimes it hangs up while downloading long songs. I finally decided to skirt the issue and use a SanDisk MMC reader. Don't try this at home!! Compaq uses a proprietary format that cannot be read by anything other than the device itself, so you are completely stuck with WindowsMedia and the iPaq for transfers.Otherwise, it's a great product once you get it out of the box."
4,very good but not great,"the i-paq is a great little mp3 player. the sound quality is fantastic and the headphones are decent (if you splurge and get a better set like the sony or phillips clip's, you'll like it the sound that much more) the only downfall is that the player has this large button in the center that almost always inadvertently gets hit which pauses your music. other than this, battery life is good, and the software for mp3 transfer is easy to use and intuitive."
1,bad news,This mp3 player might be ok if you are only interested in listening to 6 songs MAX. It takes too long to download songs from the computer onto the player and doesn't have enough memory to do ANYTHING. thank goodness i get a rebate.
4,Great sound quality and lifestyle congruent,GReat product with amazing sound quality and the size of the device really allows u to wear it on your belt. The amazon price is a steal.I did have issues with the software which hung a few times while transferring music from my PC to the player...
1,"Player's OK, but Customer Service Sucks!","As long as the units works it's OK. Not the best, but not the worst. However when it stops working (which mine did after about 4 months ownership, and use on 3 round-trip flights and 2 trips to the gym to use the stationary bike) after what I would call, not much use it stops working. Why? the batteries would not stay in place, hence no power to the unit. Considering I had not been using it for jogging etc., I would have expected it to last more than 4 months!! Customer service was not very friendly or responsive to a player dying after such little use. I had to pay for shipping and insurance for them to repair the unit. So keep this mind when you think of buying this unit!"
1,Hard to work with. Poorly supported.,"I have found this device to be very difficult to work with. It has successfully connected to my PC--via the USB port--exactly once. I have since tried to connect to another PC on my network with even less luck.I have attempted to remedy the problem via the Compaq support site and the Rioport site. Next time I plan on asking my grandmother for assistance as this will be less time consuming and will have identical results. For the kids in the back of the room, that means no results.I've gone from the Sony to the Compaq in my attempt to find a fully functioning .mp3 device that works simply and cleanly. So far both have been pretty bad but at least the Sony worked."
5,The best mp3 player.,i think this is one of the best mp3 players because its is small and not heavy. another thing of it is that this mp3 player takes inof capasity for a cd and and some more songs. all my freinds think this is the best mp3 player and the one's who have one are feeling bad about not having the mp3 player i have because it is the best mp3 player. my freinds are 17 year old and we all love music a lot. now they are sving money and selling their mp3 players so they can get the one i have.
2,They tried...,"Honestly guys, I'm a big pc, compaq, bill gates guy. I really like them. But I must admit that this attempt at mp3 players crashed and burned. This is an older model. DO NOT GET IT. Mine came with ZERO internal harddrive. Get one that COMES with something. Like a rio chiba like I now have. I might pay 40 bucks for this. I received this as a gift and kinda liked it. I could only get 20 songs on it with my 64 megs of space. I would only recommend this, more like give it another star, if you had a couple of 128 or 256 meg mmc's lying around that you're dying to sell. (...)"
2,"Great player, terrible software","The PA-1 is one of the smallest, and best looking players on the market. The sound is good, the memory is as good as most comparable players and the features are well designed. However, the software, RioPort Audio Manager, is worse than worthless: it may be impossible for you to install and will almost certainly cause you headaches. In addition, Compaq has designed their web site in such a way as to almost make it impossible to contact them for support for this product. Think twice before buying the PA-1."
5,Best player for runners!,"Player works great! If you run, walk, or bike a lot, this player is for you. Depending on the sound quality you want, you can load up hours of songs and hit the road. Just make sure to get yourself a comfortable pair of earphones. Another bonus of this model over others is the capability of handling multiple file formats."
5,Excellent MP3 Player,"I just got the player and it's worth every penny! I read reviews talking about how bad the software was, and they're wrong. You can use Windows Media Player 7.1 or Rio Port Audio Manager 3.3. Both are very simple to use. I prefer Windows Media. When you read reviews about how you need to buy new headphones, believe them. This is the best MP3 player in it's class. Buy it!"
2,not the best there is,"Well if you could get this mp3 player for FREE then maybe you should go for it, otherwise steer clear! The cost to keep up with the batteries has cost almost as much to buy the whole player! And the software it comes with is *horrible*--it takes forever to download songs to the the player, and its virtually impossible to delete a song once you've put it on there. (And don't even bother with the Compaq customer service..they're no help) Also, many times, it will only record the first 20 seconds of a few songs.(And then if you want to go back and delete that songs..well like i said--IMPOSSIBLE)One more thing. It doesn't even have a stop button on it...so no wonder it drains the batteries. Most of the CD's I make have about 20 songs on them, but this will only let you have about 13 songs max (thats including those few 20 second songs it sometimes records.) But the one good thing about it is its small and cute...so if its lookst that you are interested in, then this ones for you!"
5,Good little player ...,"Hey hows it goin?? Well i got this player for christmas and i am very impressed. The sound is great. The Back lite screen makes it easy to see in the dark. Really easy for people who haven't ever used one before. Software is very nice. Battery life is ok, could be better. Earphones are nice, but hurt your ears after a while. Very small and durable. Buttons are easy to press. Has a lock on the buttons so don't worry about switching tracks while its in your pocket. Doesn't skip. Comes with belt clip. Also comes with batteries. Good little player for those who are new to mp3 players."
2,Kids Learn America,"This book is a jumbled mess of facts that are tedious and boring to read. I ordered Kids Learn America to use with MBtP, but my son and I are both so disinterested in it that I have ordered other US Geography books to take its place."
1,Did not get it,I do not know if I want to order anything else on Amazon again. It is very disappointing to order a product and not recieve it!
2,Wagnerian Bombast,There is nothing 'Lyric' about this symphony. It's just a load of Wagnerian bombast at it's worst. Dull and pretentious. Don't waste your time.
4,3 CD in a box...,"English box set. Contains the Mechanical Animals Album, Plus the singles Dope Show part 1 & 2. Not a big deal"
4,Excellent read!,"During a weeklong layoff earlier this month, I read a lot of books, but this one was easily one of my favorites. The first story, Local Hero, was kind of an emotional rollercoaster. I found myself smiling thinking of Hester, Rad and Mitch playing in the snow together in Central Park and a lump in my throat at the end (which I won't give away). Five star storyLike other reviewers I found Dual Image a little harder to get into, but I am a lot like Ariel, so I just had to see what she was getting into! Booth is definitely a piece of work. The twist at the end of this story will knock you for a loop. Four stars."
5,Thouroughly enjoyed this book,"I have been passing on these 2 for 1 books lately because they have been a drag. I picked this book up as a last resort and was plesantly surprised. Very good story line, very hard to put down."
3,Not her best,"This book was worth reading, but in my opinion easy to put down. Even at her worst Nora Robert's is my all-time favorite author, but this was not a true display of her talent and I was disapointed. However, like always I fell in love with her characters...mainly in Hester, Mitch, and Rad."
3,Loved the cover art,The stories were okay for me but I am not much of a romance reader. I do like her suspense stories. But I did absolutely fall in love with the cover art. I looked all over the book to find the name of the artist and couldn't find it anywhere.Gapstow Bridge in Central Park in the spring done in a slightly Monetish way. Very nice.
4,The kids love it.,I bought it for my daughters 9th birthday. She and her little sister loves it. The only issue is that the screen is small. Because it is in black and white the words are hard to see unless you come up close. We plugged it into her color televison set and now everyone can read the words and sing along. It is perfect for kids. There is only one mic but there is a holder available for a second one if you want to purchase it. Im satisfied with it and I would recommend it.
2,What are the odds?? Audio good - video bad,"So we read the reviews on here and think ""ok out of all the thousands of these things they must have sold and a couple have video problems..."". We decide to order one for our daughter along with all the High School Musical kareoke version CD's. We receive it, power it up and pop in the CD. Monitor lights up, music comes on, wait, wait, wait - no video. Maybe it's the type of CD so we try the demo CD that came with it. We get a garbled glob of junk in the middle of the screen for a few seconds and then nothing.The audio is not bad for the size unit and everything seems to work fine except the now notorius video issue. I am returning this one for a replacement unit and i'll update this when the new one comes in. If it doesn't work i'm gonna buy a different brand. I think this is a definite manufacturing defect and will advise Amazon to stop selling them if the replacement is broke too."
3,Mic output poor,"I bought this for my seven and eight year old daughters. Bought an additional microphone so they could use it together. However, using just the machine on its own does not produce loud enough mic output. Not sure if something is wrong with this unit, or if it's an overall design flaw. I should have sent it back, but they were excited to use it so we hooked it up to the tv instead. The microphones work much better going through the television sound system. Overall, disappointed with the purchase."
1,Screen went out on first test song!,"When we received this, we instantly put the CD that comes with it. It made it half-way through the first song and then the screen cut out. I then tried again, and it cut out again. Finally, I grabbed a NEW CD that I just had purchased to make sure it wasn't the CD. It played 2 songs and then the screen went blank.I guess it's luck of the draw. I did not get a replacement because I didn't want to risk getting another dud & will buy one at a store. Super Bummer!!It was probably damaged in shipping, although it is wrapped up well with styrofoam. Hope no one gets my returned one :("
2,Good Concept Gone Bad,"This is the second Singing Machine that we have purchased for our two daughters within 1 month. That alone should tell you something. We purchased both units about a year ago. In both cases the volume controls stopped working and you can't adjust the volume (although you can still hear sound). After 1 week, the first unit stopped displaying the lyrics. With the second unit, the lyrics are sometimes garbled, or fall way behind the music. When it works, however, the girls and their friends really love it, and it would be great toy were it not for its sporadic performance."
1,didn't receive my order,I would write a review of this item but I haven't received it and the seller will not answer my emails or call me
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i luv it. it is really fun and it lasts really long. i've had it 4 2 yrs now and it still works just as good as it did on the 1st day. it has a lot of great features.
5,Fun for everyone!,"Got this Karaoke System for 8 year old granddaughter to help her enjoy and interact with her love of ""High School Musical"". We searched for just the right one, most not having all of the features offered by this one unless they were very expensive. This machine worked so well for all of a young music lover's needs that we then got one for our 5 year old granddaughter. Though her reading skills limited at the time, found that by her following the song on screen helped her learn to read! Win, win...Fun, fun!"
1,Disfunctional CD player,I had to go through two of these machines. The CD player would not work. I ended up having to get a refund and will look elsewhere for a karaoke machine. Very sad as this was to be a Christmas present for my daughter.
2,Worked fine until not at all!,"I bought this for my children this Christmas and it was just as I expected it to be- perfect for our needs. They could read the words fine and the sound was fine. It was straight forward and easy to use- for two weeks. One day, they turned it on to use and the screen just did not turn on- nothing. I thought it was my error- read the manual- nothing. Called the company who gave me really no help other than return it through Amazon. Amazon was very amenable to the exchange and we are waiting to try a new one which I really hope will work. If not for this issue, I would have rated it a 4."
2,An hour on the web is time better spent...,"Unfortunately as with many of Sir Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy series, ones money is much better spent elsewhere. If you can find this book for under $10.00 then it might not be a bad addition to a library but it is overpriced and out of date within months of being published. If your reading this review you obviously are online, so save the money and spend your time surfing the web. Try the Cloudy Nights review sites or even the Astronomy and Sky and Telescope sites for more pertinent information."
5,On The Riviera:,Real music and comedy! Another family favorite; use to watch this movie on the telly all the time. Now we can enjoy it whenever we wish; so glad to have found it. It was great doing business with the seller.
5,On the Riviera,"An adorable Danny Kaye movie. He plays two parts a rich playboy and a night club singer/dancer. Danny can not be beat - I especially love his song, ""Popo the puppet"" - that alone is worth buying the movie!"
4,"Michael Shayne ""mystery "" resloved!","I saw one of Shayne's mysterys years ago.....wont say how long though!Was facinated then and saddened I couldnt find dvds....until now!Always thought Mr. Noland was an under rated actor...I like his ""take"" on the role.Sam Spade (i.e. Mr. Bogart) he aint but still stands up .Good stuff to watch on a dreary Saturday afternoon."
4,Great Mcginnis featurette,"The added featurette on the great artist Robert Mcginnis makes this box set a must have. Watching him work in his studio and talk about his work was enjoyable to watch. To know that his work can still be appreciated in the new ""Hard Case Crime"" books, the ""Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang"" film and the coverwork for this dvd set is a credit to his art. Check out the Graeme Flanagan website for more information on Mcginnis. I collect his paperback covers and you can go on ebay to find out how valuable his covers are worth."
5,Wise cracking gumshoe makes good,"While Mike Shayne will never be rich in dough he will always triumph over the nad and the stupid. Here is a detective than can crack wise but watch him as he thinks his way through each case. Rivalled only by Nick Charles, Mike is a winner. Od particular note is ""The Man Who Wouldn't Die"". As close to a good spooky southern mansion type mystery as you will find this side of ""Tge Cat And The Canary""."
3,"Not essential,but not at all bad....","This is a somewhat obscure hard rock release from the 70's.Guitars are kinda Hendrix like,for point of reference.Some of the dudes from (also) Japanese band Flied Egg appear on here first.Some of these tracks where re-worked into Flied Egg songs later,so its kinda cool to hear their ""genesis"" on this disc.This music is somewhat dated to the time it was recorded,so how much you obsess over 70's-era hard rock will determine how much your gonna dig this.If you worship 70's proto-metal Hard Rock,you should probably add a star to my rating.."
3,CHARMING,"I must admit my expectations were high after reading the reviews concerning this release.However, I don't agree with these reviewers. Both music and lyrics I found to be quite boring. The vocalist wasn't that good either.The rest of the guys proved to be rather talented though.So therefore I find this being more charming than enjoyable. This having in mind that Japan didn't have a big rock scene at that time."
2,Doesn't hold to your arm,"This was given to me as a Christmas present to go with my brand new iPod Nano. Two days after using it for the first time (I was at the gym), the armband undid itself and off my arm and to the floor my Nano ALMOST went (I was able to catch it before the unthinkable happened). It happened twice more since. And what is very annoying as well is that the wheel isn't always responsive through the plastic window.Otherwise, the case itself fits the Nano 2nd generation perfectly and this product came very close to being a good one, except for the minor fact that I almost smashed my brand new toy to the ground because of it."
3,"Fun, but needs work.","Scrabble for Palm is fun, easy to use, and entertaining. BUT, it uses words, like ""doura"" and ""pe,"" not found in the Oxford English Dictionary. And doesn't recognize common words that are, like ""di,"" and ""ur."" It also misscores sometimes."
1,NOT for Win 95/95/XP/2000,"This is ONLY for the Palm OS. In some places, it says WIn 95/98/etc. Well, it's NOT!USELESS"
3,"Good way to learn, but expert level is inadequate","The following refers to version 1.1, which has hi-res support and looks great. The interface is easy to use and there are helpful features like word lookup, score history, and hints. The hints, though, are often not very good, because the AI even at expert level is simply not a sound player. It seems to rely on its vast knowledge of the official Scrabble dictionary (which is a maddeningly inconsistent book, but at least it's a standard) without paying much attention to strategy. For example, it will routinely play an ""s"" for 5 or 6 points rather than keeping it in hand for a killer move; and when it discards letters, it always seems to discard all 7. It also frequently overlooks obvious better plays.If you routinely score 300 points or better, you won't have much trouble beating this game. But it does give good practice, and it's a great way to learn obscure but handy words for your next game against a human opponent."
2,Scrabble Dictionary Needs Improvement,"I was very happy with the Palm OS Scrabble game until I discovered that MANY words were not included in the game's dictionary.Often, words were not cross-checked, so that a word, acceptable for the palm, when made plural, would be counted as wrong for the non-Palm player, even though it was correct in a regular dictionary (e.g. daydream/daydreams.) I also found that a word would be considered right for the Palm, but wrong for the player. This was frustrating and discouraged further play.I would love to see an expanded and accurate dictionary created soon."
2,Pretty Mediocre Overall,"It is definitely not challenging. It might exercise the abilities of a complete beginer but I can't see this version of this game providing stimulation for anyone who regularly scores even 250's in the regular game.I found the tiles hard to read (and I use an M505).It's levels are not configurable (you can't tune the computer to play ""smarter"" or ""dumber"" to match your abilities). The developers need to work harder on this one. Until then, I will be returning it to the store."
4,The computer makes an interesting opponent,"Very enjoyable, so long as you understand that the computer opponent plays differently than a typical human opponent. Even when you set the opponent's level to ""Novice"", it will frequently come up with obscure words like ""xu"", ""jiao"", ""tyee"" or ""aioli"". It's also better that most casual players at finding places to create multi-word combinations. It knows that a well-placed 2- or 3-letter word will often score higher than a larger word somewhere else. But it's still beatable and fun, and it will probably help make you a better player."
1,"R. Thompson - ""A Feast of Bad Intonation""","One of the worst choral sounds I've ever heard - poor intonation, wide braying vowels, hectic and frenetic tempi. Please save your money. I cannot even give it one star. Bought it to play for my choir, but don't want them to sound like that."
1,"Great Program, Disappointing Performance","I bought this CD based on the wonderful programming; however, I was very disappointed with the rather amateurish sound and technique of the choir. The performance is no better than many 'average' church choirs. I would love to buy a CD with similar programming and a professional sounding choir."
3,average performance,I hate to say it but I too was a tid bit dissapointed with this recording. I did not agree with a lot of the tempi and found the interpetation a bit inmature as a whole. This music is very simple to begin with -yet at times very intricate and sophisticated. I do appreciate the endeavor. This repetoire is most pleasing on the ear and throat which is why it is so popular. Shaw must have a recording of these works somewhere.
5,"This be off the chain, yo!!!","Get ready for the dopest album that you have ever heard. This shizznat is straight up gangsta; with a pleasant splash of funk, yo! The first track gets you right in the mood for rolling with your homies. Later on, you really feel the underlying metaphors with the masterpiece ""Straight Ruckus."" Let me continue on with The Gutsmens fresh sense of style. They make it cool to dress in second hand clothing, even though they have no bling, gats, Escalades, money, hoes, street cred, friends, rhymes, shoes, talent, health insurance, teeth, education, homes, parents or dignity."
4,Awwwwww,"I can not be more agreeing with Mark Holston, of JAZZIZ Magazine and than man himself that ""his long-stated belief that Afro-Cuban rhythms and other Latin American idioms are key parts of a new, universal music language that has yet to be written"". About time, I say. I'm neither African nor Latin, so no bias here. I've discovered this album simply by knowing it was inspiration to Dennis Chambers, a world-renowned drummer extraordinaire, and besides the drumming part the actual compositions that what got me going here. Sure, he sounds like Chick here and there and then some, but you can't deny this guy has his own voice and that is exactly what I'm constantly looking for new musical experience - a new voice that can give me goose bumps and aural satisfaction. Definitely will buy more music from this artist."
5,Truly amazing! God give me talent of this kind!,This man is unbelievable. I'd love to be inside his brain for 1 minute. This CD left me and my father both with our jaws dropped to the floor. How does he do it? Pure genius is how....
1,SUCKS!!!!,"My second Rubalcaba cd and my last. To my musical taste, music should be melodic and as far as I am concerned this is far from it. Talent? Yeah, he has ability but no taste. As a Cuban musician I was terribly dissapointed. If you want to hear Cuban piano at his best do yourself a favor and buy a cd from Chucho Valdes, Peruchin, Frank Emilio, Ruben Gonzalez, etc. but stay away from this one."
4,It's not Trade Wind,"You know, I liked this book. It's not Trade Wind, which I loved, and I was frustrated that it didn't refer back more to the pre-history of this story and talk more about the original characters (Rory and Hero). They are truly two of my favorite people in romantic fiction. Regardless, I found the whole Lash/Dany romance to be charming. Some of the dialogue I found as anthropologically interesting as if it were Inuit. I mean, did people really talk that way then?? And if so, how interesting..."
5,Stump Village is truly the place to be!,"I had high hopes for Hello Kitty and her magical ""Stump Village"". I was not dissapointed! This is the best dvd you will ever hope to purchase! It has it all: Cinnamoroll getting mad and baking bread, Hello Kitty getting furious, and Pom Pom Purin picking strawberries and being extremely hearty! THE BEST DVD OF ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,What the Heck...?,"I might have enjoyed this DVD if I had been drunk while watching it. The ""claymation"" type characters were cute, as can be expected from Sanrio, and Badtz Maru building his house was adorable. Unfortunately I was taken aback by the downright rude and crude antics. Booger jokes (including sticking one on a drawing), toilet jokes (including POV from the toilet), a flatulence line-up reminiscent of frat boys, thievery without apologies or remorse, and just general bad behavior with little repentance abound in the ridiculously short episodes. The credits make up for the blink-and-miss-it runtime by rolling for what feels like ages. Sure, the DVD has its place, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids. College students on a Saturday night with leftover pizza and a partial case of beer, on the other hand, would probably find this DVD hilarious in a warped kind of way."
3,Third Season Only Gets A Third Star,"This is a mediocre Hank Mobley CD to say the least. Mobley's late 50s Blue Note albums are solid hard bop affairs, and his early 60s albums for the label are classics. But after 1963, the albums are hit or miss. The problems with ""The Third Season"" can be summed up in the first track, ""An Aperitif."" After a creative theme, Lee Morgan plays an uncharacteristically uninspired trumpet solo, and Sonny Greenwich, when he's not trying to catch up to the song's tempo, is playing some pretty boring licks. Thankfully, Mobley and Cedar Walton are in fine form, and they help save the recording. Since this is a limited edition CD, many people will want to pick it up quickly. But if you're new to Mobley's music, start with ""Soul Station"" or ""Workout."""
1,The long dark rambling of the boredom&dirk gentlys confusing,"... agency.Well,I love his other books, you know. hhgttg (hithchikers guide to the galaxy) trilogy, In fact it's my favorite book. But this one SUUUCKS!! I can't remember how many times I fell asleep while tring to read this monstrosity. I still haven't figured out why the horse was upstairs to begin with, and now,I really don't care."
5,Fantastic Rockumentary,"The stories behind working musicians, ""Funkytown"" should be a staple for anyone thinking about getting into the music business. And the music... unbelievable!"
5,Pretty good watch,"I wear this watch daily, and I'm very much satisfied by it, starting with the leather which is of good quality and seems pretty durable! comfortable to wear and goes along with casual as well as formal wear--"
4,Good,"I bought this book mainly as a source for a research paper I had to write. It was a spectacular read, at least the portions that I used for my paper. Newell does a prime job of displaying what, in his view, being a man is all about. It is quite a wonderful thing to have a compendium of this sort as it broadens knowledge both in specific fields and also generally. I'd recommend this if you're looking into readings by various famous authors and other people of the sort.-Kev"
5,Great addition to the kitchen library.,some of the best pictures and general kitchen reading I have seen in a while. Great book for those old timey dishes grandma made.
5,Way to Cook,The Way to Cook cookbook from Julia Child is a classic that I wanted for my cookbook collection; I have had it a short time but look forward to using more recipes.
4,Julia's Way To Cook,"This has great practical value. Super pics. You learn transferrable techniques. It's more than a book of recipes, though it is that as well."
5,great resource.,A great resource for learning how to cook from simple recipes and methods that serve as the basis for creating more complex ones.
4,"excellent collection, bad DVD","I own the VHS set, minus 2 programs, so I thought I'd treat myself to this collection. The DVD arrived with funny marks in it that proved to be defective. The DVD hardly played. I love this collection (gotta love her!), so I'm hoping the one they send me in return will be fine."
3,Not that Great,"Julia is delightful, as always. However, the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section, you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast, followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section, you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter, heavy cream, and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups, so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave. But if you are already buying fresh ingredients and putting meals on the table, this will not really teach you much."
5,Julia Chlld The Way to Cook,"Beautiful book! Full of full-color pictures, and with recipes that I've wanted since I lived in France decades ago. I'm not sure how it could be improved upon."
3,"Adore Julia, but this is not as good as her other series....","I have always loved Julia Child and have learned so much from watching her shows and reading her cookbooks. This series for the cookbook of the same name is fair but it looks like it was done fast and ""on the cheap."" I wish they would release her JULIA CHILD and COMPANY series. I really loved that one and some of her other shows."
5,Julia explains her wonderful recipes step by step.,"Julia explains her wonderful recipes step by step. They are shown in organized orders, which are easy to follow. Pictures are great help in visualizing what you are suppose to do and what you are making."
5,Finally on DVD !!!!!!,"I had the video set produced in 1985. They were getting worn out and sometimes my video player would mess up. I even emailed the producers, to see if they would put them out on DVD. They finally did, now I have a nice copy again!!!!I love watching her cook over and over, and see something new each time!!!She is missed. :) :) :)"
5,Basic techniques for cooking success!,"Although I'd seen some reruns of Julia's shows on PBS as a kid, I had largely forgotten about her as an adult struggling to learn how to cook without making everything into a flambe. I picked up this DVD set in the hopes that Julia could help me get things figured out. And I was right - I can't recommend this enough! The repetition of variations on a theme (meats, veggies, etc.) help you to remember principles of cooking that aren't always intuitive.This would be a great gift for aspiring cooks who want to methodically build up basic cooking techniques. The little recipe book that comes with the DVDs is perfect to take with you into the kitchen after viewing. Bon appetite!"
5,Great teaching tool,"The Way to CookMy son is interested in learning how to cook. While he can do simple foods, like spaghetti and chili, he wanted to learn things which take a lot of expertise when it comes to methods of preparation. This cook book takes you from very simple recipes to tougher ones, building on the previous lessons. He's thrilled with the book, as am I. It's a comprehensive guide to cooking that will last him a lifetime."
2,Paperback edition falls apart!,Love the contents! But the book is poorly bound and falls apart very quickly. Not worth the money. Buy the original in hardback. Don't waste money on the paperback.
4,Fun to read and yummy to cook,Tons of information from Julia on various ways to properly cook a dish. I just love the way her personality comes through in her recipes. The Coq Au Vin was delicious (of course) and looking forward to making her Boeuf Bourguignon soon. This cookbook is not just about ingredients and simple recipes-there is so much detail and references to other pages that it is hard to put down. Find myself regularly skimming through it and always learning more about food and preparation.
4,"Basics, still good","This is a very basic cooking dvd, which I think is good for everyone, even if it's just a review. I don't consider myself a novice cook, but I even got some techniques and tips from it. I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing, like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine, not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality. I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes. Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show. Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price, under $11."
5,"Julia Child ""The Way To Cook""","Hi ThereFirstly, I must compliment Amazon for their prompt attention and follow ups. This has left a good impression, I have even told my family and friends about the good service.As for Julia Child's book, The Way To Cook, I think I made a good choice and will be referring to her book a lot this winter.Thank youSandy Robertshaw"
5,The Elegant Bible of Cooking,"Elegance:- Refinement, grace, and beauty in movement, appearance, or manners.- Tasteful opulence in form, decoration, or presentation.- Restraint and grace of style.- Scientific exactness and precision.In other words, - Julia Child's The Way to Cook."
2,Lard will clog your arteries,Anything that tastes good cannot be good for you. Fat sells.So take everything said in this book with a grain of salt.
4,Great tips is you want to improve your cooking.,"Not as frantic as the typical food channel offering of today, but more like spending a little time with a master of her craft. The lady knew her stuff!"
4,"DVD is fun, but Case is very weak","DVD is fun, and the cook booklet is inside the case. It's easy to follow Julia's instruction, and I already tried a couple of them. But the DVDs' case is very weak. When I removed DVDs, they broke, so I won't be able to use the case anymore."
3,pretty good for non-professionals,"i'm a massage therapist and ordered this DVD just after school in hopes of gaining new techniques and reveiw.It covered many things i learned about Swedish style massage, but didn't have a lot of info on anatomy, or endangerment sites that i think non-professionals need to know about.overall a good resource for families."
5,Just a great collection,"I picked up this CD after I saw Out Of The Grey in concert. It captures their almost 10 year history as an amazing musical duo. This is a worth while buy. Two things drew me into this CD. First, the amazing talents - guitar and voice. They are top notch, yet very under rated. Second, the lyrics. They are all thoughful and deep. One really gets pulled in by their meaning. Come on. What are you waiting for? Listen to some of the songs and buy it. You won't be sorry."
1,Not a replacement for Hamilton Beach 43254,"My search of ""replacement carafe for Hamilton Beach 43254"" yielded this result so I ordered it. It DOES NOT work with that coffee maker. I'm returning it."
4,My review,"This is a very good introduction to the subject of anachronistic fruits and the extinct animals they may have been designed for. As with all introductions, there is enough information to satisfy the curious but not enough to satiate someone who really wants to dig into the subject. It is an informative and readable book in a conversational style."
4,"At this point, collect them for the cover art","I've been a diehard fan of DoA since 1983, but I'm a little puzzled why they keep remixing You Spin Me Round? DoA has PLENTY of other great songs that I would loved to see remixed and I think they would sell! Brand New Lover, Save You All My Kisses, Son of a Gun, Nukleopatra, International Thing, Rebel Rebel, Isn't It a Pity are all songs that could be remixed with new cover art.At this point, I buy the new CD single remixes for the cover art. Pete Burns is a mastermind chameleon, much like Madonna. Only his new looks are so extreme - you have to look twice and simply smile!!"
2,Handling Troubles Afloat,"The book is written by a British sailor using many nautical terms unfamiliar to even an experienced sailor. Much of the information is very useful, ""IF"" sense can be made of it.By the time the book would make sense to you, you would have so much experience that you wouldn't need it.I am halfway through the book, and may not finish it because it is so frustrating trying to understand his examples. In addition, the illustrations seem to be quite old, I believe.Incidently, I have been sailing in the US for more than 20 years, and taught sailing for a considerable period of time.Money is better spent elsewhere, in my opinion."
4,DEADLY SHADOWS,FROM BEGINNING TO END CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. I WILL READ ALL FIVE OF THE KINNCAID BROTHERS. SHE HOLD YOUR INTEREST FROM THE FIRST PAGE.
3,Liked it.good energy between characters. Could use some better transitions between scenes. A little choppy.,See above as to flow and the need for a little more tension. I liked the love scenes but could use more suspense.
4,Love it,Wow kept me guessing the whole time thrilling and suspenseful and the ups and down of Jessie and Adine couldn't stop reading
3,Good read,This was a nice reading book. Keep my interest and developed characters. Will read more of Jaycee's books. Hope that helps.
4,Very good but...,"I loved this book, my title says very good but... because I felt that it strayed away from the suspense part of the book a little too much. I love a good suspense and I love a good love story, this one seemed to be well written, but at times it felt a bit disjointed, almost like the ""nightmare"" of the suspense was an afterthought. It was a great read, I had trouble putting it down and getting my work done, but it was a different suspense than what I'm use to. The love story of the book was as forefront as the suspense, it wasn't a side line like in some other books. Having said that, I truly liked the book and have already downloaded book 2 in the series Deadly Ties and will be starting it tonight! :)Overall the book is a great easy read that keeps you guessing until the very end! The ending did not turn out like I guessed it would! Purchase it, you will NOT be disappointed!"
4,Spellbinder,I really enjoyed this book and didn't have the mystery solved until almost the end. I will read more by this author.
5,Great romance.....and the suspense was fantastic!,i really enjoyed this book. I did feel a few places were a bit slow BUT overall I'd read it again....and I will read it again! The characters are written in depth and the reader FEELS the character's emotion. There are some very suspenseful moments that just about killed me and I loved it.I'm going to get the next in this series. Very entertaining story and the writing is good. Thank you!
1,Painful to read,"Did she not have an editor??So boring! Terrible plot, ridiculous and unrealistic dialogue that the author obviously thought sounded clever but really came off as stilted and clumsy. I had zero interest in these characters from the 2nd chapter on. I had to force myself to read the second half of the book. Now I'm just pissed because I believed the other reviews and bought the whole series.I'd return them if I could.Don't bother with this book or this author. I certainly will avoid all her work in the future."
1,Painful Read,This book could have been half the length and was really boring. I never write reviews but felt really let down by this book.
5,Absolute Must Read!!,"Exceptional book in every way!! Ms. Clark has an absolute artistic way with her words, painting each picture with clarity and feeling. I am so thrilled to have found an author that has the ability to bring emotions out of me while reading! I cannot wait to start the next book in the Kinncaid series!!"
2,could have been better,I felt like I was kind of let down when it came to this book being a romantic suspense.It was more of a romance book than anything else and she just threw enough mytstery for it to fit into the suspemse catagory.This story had loads of potential to becoming a very chilling book.I found myself wondering wehen the villian's point of veiw would come again and it finally did almost till then end.The villain's identity wasn't even eough for a footnote in the book as a whole.I liked Aiden and Jesslyn...I thought there relationship was the only good thing about this book.I wouldn't recommend this book for people who like romantic suspense.
2,Not a fan,This book was pretty boring and i had to force myself to finish the second half. I found it difficult to connect with the characters.
5,Underrated Classic,"This DVD is a brilliant transfer from the original negative and the film itself deserves its place in any top 100 but being a total religious epic it wouldn,t be considered by some,shame though,because its a fantastic drama,full of emotion and along side ""Exodus"" is Otto Premingers finest work. The novel was considered impossible to film at the time,but despite some alterations the film still grips. Leave your religious views aside for 3 hours and enjoy a masterpiece"
5,The Cardinal is Excellent!!,"I've seen this movie before, many years ago, and simply wanted to walk down memory lane. I did enjoy the walk."
5,Very good,Very good. I liked it a lot. The acting was very good and the storyline was strong. Would recommend to anyone.
2,"Not a very good film in 1963, and now very dated.","The Cardinal has one of the great soundtracks of any film of this size/length, and it has John Huston, about whom the entire film should have been about. A lying, prevaricating, domineering, proud, greedy, irreligious prelate that reflects what we know today about Cardinals and Bishops and Popes. Huston hits the mark of our time over and over, but the focus of this film is essentially the church justifying its fascism for God wants it that way for the time being, a fascism that includes the exclusion of all truth, so that scandals abound, but they are part of the crosses the Church must bear as well as create. Lies, truth, sex, power, embezzlement,etc etc are all in the hands of the church to do with as it wills. Too bad then\ laity disagrees, but they'll come around in time.I wonder what God thinks of all this? The Catholic Church would say,""If God disagrees, write out a big check for Him. He'll take it."""
5,Refreshing,The Cardinal is an excellent story of the early times in the church. It is nicely done and portrays the very difficult life of a priest who becomes a Cardinal and all the struggles he had to overcome. It is an excellent movie.
5,A WORTHY ADDITION FOR FILM COLLECTORS!,"I remember seeing this film 40 years ago. It wasa classic then, its a classic now. A film for anyreligion!"
5,The Cardinal,"I ordered this movie which I remember seeing as a kid. I recall there were many social issues presented in the movie such as abortion, church intrigues,the early war years, politics both global and in the church, and other issues which I thought would be just as relavent to those of today within the Holy Apostolic Church.I was not dissappointed.Whoever has a deep interest in Vatican affairs, I feel you will enjoy this classic movie, and for those of you over 50, it's nice to see the actors/actresses we still see today as they appeared on the 50's once again. Tom Tryon used to be one of my favorite actors. He always played straight up, moral roles."
4,The Cardinal,"I liked the movie. The acting was great. If I had a compliant, it would be the movie should have been a little longer.They tried to do to much in the time. But it was a great movie tnat I will see over and over."
4,An interesting product of its times...,"""The Cardinal"" could probably not be made the same way today, but it is killfully crafted by Otto Preminger at the height of his powers. Long but never boring, we're treated to a rare English-language appearance of the tragic Romy Schneider, to whom fate brought such misery and ended a life all too quickly. It does bring the viewer a close-up glimpse of pre-Vatican Council church workings and the adequate script is well-handled by even the minor characters. It deserves to be seen uncut and on a big screen where possible."
2,Information a bit out of date,"This book gives the information it claims to - the only problem is, a good portion of it is out of date. For example, the link for the government assistance catalogue leads you to an area of the Library of Congress website that indicates it's no longer maintained. When you finally find the link for the catalogue, it doesn't work."
5,"This CD combines talent and individualality, and is great","This CD is very impressing and enjoyable, and the songs have real meaning, not just garble. An example of this is the song Real World. It is almost funny in his predicament. Also the awesome ability in which lead singer Rob Thomas has, and the individual voice he poseses, is incredable. I can't wait for his next CD"
2,Credit to Joseph Mitchell,"The samplings i read from your book read akin to a piece wrote more than 50 years previous-""McSorley's Wonderful Saloon"", by Joseph Mitchell.Is there one reference to Joseph Mitchell in your book-or commentaries discussing your book?If not, is this an unconcious misake, or a deliberate one?"
5,Great value in a filter adapter,I'm very satisfied with the quality of the threads and the adapter has a very nice finish. You can't go wrong at this price.
5,Works flawlessly,"This adapter do the trick giving some versatility to the 58mm filters. Threads are well done, however, due to its price, may be it's advisable to use it with care.It is a ""most have"" for tight budget apprentice and amateurs.Este adaptador funciona, dando versatilidad al los filtros de 58mm. Las roscas están bien hechas, sin embargo, dado su precio, tal vez es recomendable ser cuidadosos al utilizarlo.Es una pieza impresindible para aficionados y aprendices con bajo presupuesto."
2,"If you can stomach the pasty and stiff Rose, Jimmy Buffett's interview is a good collector piece for Parrotheads...","I like Jimmy Buffett's interview here butRose is a pretty sorry establishment/Int-erviewer/Hack. Always, or nearly always onthe wrong side of every issue. [See also hisgibberish on NAFTA (No American FactoriesTaking Applications)."
5,Great Feminist and Art theory,"This is an excellent anthology of Lippard's essays. I found it especially helpful as I am writing a thesis on ""third wave"" feminist art. Her essays are thoughtful and insightful without being full of jargon, so even those with no background in feminist theory can get the gist of the writing. Its great to be able to read the oldies and see how much has- and sadly, hasn't- changed. Most interesting are Lippard's updates and introductions to the older essays, in which she prefaces them with how her thoughts on the topics have changed or shifted since the essays were written.This is a really thorough and broad reaching book on art and feminism.I highly suggest it for all feminist artists (especially younger ones who missed the first wave) and those who study feminism and/or art."
2,Not well made,"Bought this mostly to hang on the wall with some of my junk collection. Fits in rather well I think, came pre-distressed.I have about 6-7 other hand drills, one is a two speed, 24""-30"" (depending on which top handle is used, stright ones, have 2 lengths or a cast steel metal breast plate to really get with it, made 1920's or earlier, this for serious hand drilling.Great Neck is a good name in tools, have a number of mechanic's but they have gone down hill with their out sourcing.Drill no. 42, the gears make a lot of noise, doesn't turn smooth, cannot say anything about the chuck as did not drill anything before I hung it on the wall.Use an English made, about the same size, has double gears, real quite, light weight, smooth turning, when I need to do any precision small drilling like 1/64"" and smaller.Would not recommend this if you are looking for a real hand drill."
5,Great Neck 42 Hand Drill,"I like to have a hand drill in my ""small projects"" tool box so if I need to drill something the drill is there along with my other commonly used tools. Longer than the one it replaced from Sears that was 30 years old, I dropped it and bent the shaft. Some assembly required of the wooden crank handle and side stablizing handle."
1,chuck won't hold a drill bit straight,"When you tighten the chuck some of the jaws twist around, making impossible to get the drill bit in straight. It's fairly crudely, but solidly made (in China), the body is cast iron. It's clunky to operate. Perhaps a deal at $5, but if you're serious, buy something better."
1,Hand Drill is defective,This was a present for my son. He is returning it because it is defective and will not hold the drill bits. Please refund my money. I have found another locally. Thank You.
1,"both good and bad, and ugly for sure","I've had mine for a year and a month now, used it intermittently over that time on both wood and metal, and today the axle pin for the upper gear broke. Turns out that part is made of *plastic*! It wasn't apparent earlier because it's mostly hidden. So besides the poor quality of the iron casting, the ill-fitting and wobbly construction, the handles that are always coming unscrewed with use, and the overall cheap feel to it, a vital piece is made of flimsy thermoplastic. No excuse for that.On the ""pro"" side, the chuck handles up to 3/8 inch bits, something I wasn't expecting. And I'm hoping to be able to fix this break with a piece of 3/8"" steel or brass stock, or maybe even a cut-off 3/8"" bolt."
1,GreatNeck 42 Hand Drill,"This is a terrible product. I would give it a ZERO STARS rating if possible. A waste of money. Chinese JUNK. The first one was useless and returned. The second was also unacceptable, but I kept it to avoid the return hassle a second time. PROBLEM: The small knob on the hand crank is held on with a swaged pin in the gear wheel. The wooden knob is defectively drilled off-center, and it will not turn freely on the swaged pin. The pin and knob bind, so free rotation is not possible. It cannot be cranked at a constant, controlled speed due to the drag between the knob and pin. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,I'm against that approach,I don't think he should be spanked.I think he might learn more from a couple of German shepherds instead of his brave little dachshund.
1,Grow up,"I agree with Khyraen 100% on this one. Completely childish and shows the hypocrisy of those who are supposely againsts spanking, and the baloney that they now need therapy! Imagine the outcry if someone made a simular ""bumper sticker"" about one of them.I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. This section is for REVIEWS. It is NOT a debate forum and it is NOT a place to launch personal attacks against those who share different views from you. Grow up!"
3,Not as thrilled,"My hairdresser used this brush on my hair. I seemed to really like it. When I bought it and actually used it myself, I felt it was overpriced and not as easy to use as I had hoped."
1,Don't waste your money...............,This book was extremely remedial and provided little insight relative to starting a new job. If you're starting a new job and want a roadmap for success I would suggest purchasing a book with some thought provoking substance.
1,Your First 90 Days in a New Job (How to Make an Impact),"An excellent example of why not to buy a book for its title. The prophetic cover photo depicts an empty wasteland. Between the covers lies a stream of consciousness devoid of research, common sense, practical experience and humor. The author must have devoted at least two hours to writing this book. No, it wouldn't have taken that long for a competent typist."
2,Gave this book away...but made some notes first,"I read through this book in about an hour or so. I felt most of it would be very remedial for many managers. Since I am not a manager (and not going to be), much of this book's content did not pertain to me.However, two topics did stand out. The description of the four managerial types (Laid Back, Ready-Fire-Aim, Popular & Hard Nose) with 'handling' suggestions would be useful for anyone at any level. The topic of preparing for the 'miss' (missed sales goal, missed product deliverable, missed date, etc.) was very informative,too. Few of us ever prepare to fail and when it happens to us, we are unprepared to explain it.I decided NOT to keep this book as part of my permanent library, but I did give this book to someone who coachs people in job search for their personal lending library. It was worth the $8.75 I paid for it because I got free Amazon shipping, but not much more...."
1,Wasted money,This book is true to it's title. I plan to circulate it among my newer employees to help them achieve their 1st 90 days of employment.
2,Not worth it.,I found this book to be a total waste of money. It's a short little book without a lot of insight or tips. Not helpful.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! !,"This book was awful. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would have. This book had no insight at all on developing any kind of strategy for moving forward in your career. The book itself has typos, formatting inconsistencies and spelling errors. As the title states, we are in ""Harsh Economic Times"", so save your money for a book with some real advice."
4,Good buy,"Its smaller than expected, but still fits and the quality is good. My advice is to get once size bigger than you think you need."
3,A starting point in yo-ing,"To start anything a person needs the basics. This cd-rom provides just that: the basics. It gives all the standard yo-ing movements which can then be combine to create much more complicated moves. The movies and step-by-step drawings are valuable for beginners. Since this product is developed by a particular company, the list of the yo-yos are limited to those of that company. It's not even up-to-date. Overall, it's still a good program for someone who is beginning to learn how to yo."
5,u dont get it,"every other review of this book has dumbfounded me. they dont get the concept of the book at all. i hear all the negative reviews, but for the wrong reasons, the book is brilliant and the best klimt out there and here's why. It's a window into the genius's mind, we get to see all of his sketches to each corresponding piece. for any real artist it's a jewel of composition, type design, and beautiful ideas. the people who want books of the famous pieces, are the same people who like the force fed music the radio stations give them and the women who wear broaches on sunday when they go for the annual museum outing (no offence grandma) . welcome to thinking for yourself. and finding out how gustav klimt thinks. good book...."
2,Incomplete illustrations,"I fell in love with Klimt after a trip to Vienna. This book was the first I purchased in hopes of taking some of his work with me, but I was sorely disappointed. Little of his most recognized work is included. Although the information was good, the illustrations were lacking."
5,Great adventure,"Great book, and great idea. Who would not want to take off work and follow the striper run, and tell the stories of those who part of striper lore.....Great read."
2,Maybe I missed something,"But, as an avid striped bass fisherman, I thought that this book only scratched the surface of what could've been written regarding the fall run of America's best sportfish. The concept is great, following the fish down the coast, and the approach is well thought out as well, hooking up w/ experienced guides/characters along the way to meld their stories/experiences in with his own. Maybe this book is for those who aren't as familiar w/ striped bass fishing, but every time a story began to unfold, the writer just moved on. Even the most avid fisherman enjoys reading insightful, exciting, and educational fishing reports in the local paper, so I thought the bar was pretty low. Write a book about striped bass, and I will read it, and probably like it, but this book had all the makings for a great story, the writer just fell short of exploring any of his experiences, characters, or even the fish, in great depth."
5,"I'm Never Wrong, But...","When a friend gave me a copy of ""On The Run, I figured that I would skim through it and put it with all the other books that I'll never read again. After all, what do I care about striped bass, or the people who fish for them. I'm never wrong about these things. But this time, I wasn't as right as I'd like to be.This book isn't about fishing. It's about a journey taken by a man who loves to fish and his contacts with a group of similarly-minded and sometimes unusual people. It's very well written and organized by a man with a great eye for detail and a fine sense of humor. Even better, it is replete with facts I never knew. In short, this book is a real page turner. ( started reading it in my porcelain study and only put it down after my feet and legs fell asleep).This book is a definite keeper."
5,A great read for those wanting to use what they have,"This book is amazing! Jacqelyn Small makes therapy easy for everyone. This book includes suggestions for everyone from the friend to the professional counselor. After reading so many therapy books that try to 'can' everything into a particular method, Jacquelyn Small makes it easy to use the tools you already have to be here and now with those in your life."
3,It's okay,"This is a good book, but is pretty basic. Probably good for a beginning counselor, but not those with more experience."
3,Good quality bad shipment!,"The construction of the machine was adequate, but during shipping, the monitor dropped out of place, bending and ripping out the top support bracket, within 1 week the pin the the bottom door rotates on broke of its bracket. It works great, really loud, wish I could contol volume."
3,"mildy entertaining, yet very amateurish...","'Troublemaker' is an early entry in the Dave Brandstetter (,gay insurance investigator,) mystery series. Yes, the plot is a murder mystery connected to the gay community (in the 1970s). But the mystery is not terribly engaging, and being such a short book I found the characterizations to be very thin ... to the point several of the characters seemed almost identical. It would have been helpful if the dialogue was crisp or if there were clever plot twists. Alas, 'Troublemaker' has neither.Bottom line: more of a outline of a mystery novel than a real mystery novel. Not recommended."
2,Cherbot:,"I ADORE the original version of ""You Spin Me Round' (Like A Record)"". Even though I detest the music machine of SAW, I must commend them for their collaboration with Pete Burns / Steve Coy and Co. The ONLY good that came from it is this song, in it's finest and original form. These tracks are mildy danceable, but HIGHLY forgetable."
3,Well.......,Not at all what I expected. Richard Roxburgh played his part as well as always but was let down by the rest of the cast and the story. Disappointing.
1,DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!!!,"Once again, Amazon has priced the complete (up to now, anyway) Looney Tunes Golden Collection Set HIGHER than if you bought them all individually. They did this last year with the set of the first three volumes. Now that volume 4 has come out, they've dropped the price of the three volume set to a reasonable price (actually quite a good deal). For the best price on all 4 volumes at once, buy the three volume set and then buy volume 4 seperately. Or wait until next year when volume 5 comes out and Amazon drops the price on this four volume set. The one-star rating is for the price of the set. The cartoons themselves are excellent and would earn a five-star rating if purchased at reasonable prices."
1,Do the math!!!,"You can buy this set of 4 for $194.99, or you can buy all 4 separately for $142.90. This makes no sense! Either the people at Amazon can't do math or they're hoping their customers can't!"
1,agreed- a rip off,"Not only can you get the sets cheaper individually, but als, this bundle of vol. 1 through 4 costs $90 more than the bundle containing sets 1 through 3. Bizarre indeed."
5,A comprehensive teaching tool and a good reference,"Rescue Technician: Operational Readiness for Rescue Providers is a comprehensive teaching tool and a good reference for any personnel currently working in emergency services or aspiring to work in this profession. This manual clearly explains and teaches the topics covered by NFPA 1006 Standard for Technical Rescuer Professional Qualifications, NFPA 1670 Standard on Operations and Training for Technical Search and Rescue Incidents, NFPA 1936 Standard on Powered Rescue Tools, and NFPA 1951 Standard on Protective Ensembles for Technical Rescue Incidents. A very good book in general. A good read."
4,Food Brain - 'Bansan' (Universal Distribution),"Originally released in 1970, hearing the self-titled Shinki Chen disc (sse my review) is what inspired me to check out this title. Not bad. Didn't know it was actually jazz-rock, though. Tunes I liked best were the {sort of} stunning nine-minute ""That Will Do"", the somewhat impressive ""Waltz For M. P. B."", ""Clock"" - has somewhat of a psych edge to it and the Avant Garde fifteen-minute ""The Hole In The Sausage"". Line-up: Shinki Chen - guitars, Masayoshi Kabe -bass, Hiro Yanagida - keyboard & organ, Michihiro Kimura - clarinet and Hiro Tsunoda - drums. Wanted to mention that this isn't my favorite genre of music, but I can listen to this disc. Hear it for yourself."
1,predictable,"I am in total agreement with the other reviewer. Just one honest conversation and the truth would've came out. I also hate when there is an evil MIL. Ever notice it's always the evil MIL or the conniving secretary? The plot is just too canned for this book to be enjoyable. When books follow this recipe, it almost seems like the author is spoofing romance books.Another aspect I hate is when the husband sees other women while the couple is separated and the wife stays faithful. Just once I wished it was the other way around or at least have the husband also stay loyal during the separation too.I have no idea why I finished reading this book. I could see where it was going from the prologue, but yet I continued to turn the pages. A total waste of time!"
1,So horrible,"First they are married and in lust with each other -- then the wife leaves him because she thinks he's a cheating, no-good SOB, and he thinks she's a money-hungry manipulative b--ch. This story is sadly SO formulatic, just like so many other Presents and I think it's a waste of time. I have to say, I hate a romance where just one good conversation between the two main characters would clear up their issues with each other, and they don't have that conversation for any number of silly reasons. THE GREEK'S MILLIONARE MARRIAGE is that kind of romance novel."
4,Next best cookbook!,If you haven't already purchased: Marlene Koch's Eat what you Love cookbook then this is also a great substitute. I love the section on Cheesecake! Mmmm...
4,Excellent gift.,It was a present for my American sister who has a sweet tooth and was recently found with diabetes 2. She was delighted by the present.
3,Ok book on Splenda use,"This book was ok, but it had too many recipes that use brown sugar or Splenda blend."
2,"If you like Splenda, It's OK","I've tried several recipes from the book, as well as several other dessert recipes using splenda. Came to the conclusion I just don't like splenda. Can't even get used to it in my coffee. I'll take sugar (still try and keep things low fat) and concentrate on portion control. I realize that some folks can't have sugar, and I suppose these desserts are better than nothing. But I was very unimpressed with the tastes of the various things I tried (pmpkin pie and chocolate cake; to name two)."
1,sugar-free cooking,"Almost all recipes require a special trip to store for ingredients. I would think they would involve NORMAL ingredients found on the home pantry shelf, except for the Splenda. Such as: prune puree or baby food prunes, Dutch-process cocoa powder, molasses, whole-wheat pastry flour. (who has this stuff already on their shelf)"
3,Love this cookbook!,"I use this cook book often. Easy to read & understand, more than just desserts and helpful hints to cooking healthier! Would be better if colored photos were included, but still a great resource!"
4,Good Amazon buy,"This book is a very nice size. Large !! It covers the hints about using Splenda,which is worth reading. She has a nice variety of recipes.She uses regular ingredients in the recipes, I had most of them in my pantry. I can not think of any wild ingredients in any of the recipes. A nice reference book to have on your shelf. With this you can search for more recipes, exotic if you desire, on the web. Price was very inexpensive for the size."
5,Super Book,"I am always looking for some yummy recipes that don't have a lot of sugar in them. With this book, there are so many to choose from. Great book to have on hand for those special occasions."
4,"Variety, but few pictures","Nice variety -- desserts, mains, etc. Very few pictures, but for what I paid it's excellent. Glad I didn't pay full price, tho."
3,"A cool idea, but makes sure your buddies have one too.","Got this for Christmas and was pretty excited. The product installs easily and works as advertised for the most part but has some quirks. First of all, you need a real sound card to plug into. Forget it if you are using audio built into to your motherboard. Secondly, when using the GameVoice it defaults to a setting where it masks your voice. You have to dig around the options to change it. Also, sometimes I experienced a lag or echo when talking which made conversations difficult to understand.Finally, the GameVoice only really pays off when you are playing with 3 or more people that also have it. I play mostly with one other person at at time and we ended up using speakerphone while we gamed over DSL. The Game Voice would probably be worth buying if most of your game buddies had one as well."
3,Phone companies do not have to worry!,"Being an avid gamer and sick of having neck cramps from holding the phone, I made this purchase. The hardware and software installed easily and the setup was fast. (I am using MS WIN ME and they're no issues) Testing it out with my favorite game left much to be desired. Even with a fast cable connection, there is a long delay that makes this product hard to use. There is an update you can get which supposedly corrects that a bit. I will be trying it shortly. I think this is a great idea but the technology is not quite there yet. My advice.....buy a headset for your cordless phone!"
3,Not much better than the competition,"The desktop puck has never been helpful to me. Also, the speech recognition feature is not very good and uses way too many CPU cycles. The headset itself is good, even very good. Also, the switch on the puck (sound from main speakers or sound from headphones) is convenient. However, the device takes up a USB slot as well as the sound connections. Overall, I think it's not worth the extra money. Get a generic or brand-name headset. Also, don't use the ""game voice"" software- use ""teamsound"" from teamsound.com. It's free and works well."
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes that this would enhance my gaming experience. I'm fond of Battlefield 1942, and I was excited about the possibility of communicating with my friends in the online gaming environment. After setting the thing up and logging on with a friend (who purchased a Game Voice the same time I did), I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I could barely hear my buddy and there was serious distortion. During game play (where there is a lot of ambient noise, i.e., tanks, bombs, etc.) I couldn't hear my buddy at all..."
5,This Should Be Your First Book,This Should Be Your First Book. So many straight forward tips to count. Just exceptional information presented in an entertaining and down to earth manner.
5,Southern Runnin',"Southern Runnin' is an excellent book. I would reccamend this book to any-one interested in Cars and Car Racing. It is about truth, trust, and loyalty. It shows that sometimes no matter how hard or bad things get to hold trough. It also shows that what goes around, comes around. I highley reccamend this book."
5,A must read,"I don't even have to read this book without knowing that it's very informational because my father wrote it, so it has to be good."
3,I hope the next addition is better,"I use this book for school. I've gone through almost the whole thing in 3 months. Some things I need to point out are that,1. I don't care about hand drafting.2. The CADD segments should be mixed in; I currently just skip them as there aren't any questions on it.Anyway, besides that and outdated references, it's a decent book until you hit chapter 42. Chapter 42 on is killer."
5,Excellent for tile work,I used this to lift old tile off a bathroom floor with the wide chisel also sold on Amazon. Dusty work but got the job done.The chisel is listed as Wide Blade Scraper (OLD1970) Category: Air Hammer Chisels
3,DVD encoding not clarified,Can't play it properly on my US format DVD player. I wish I had know that. But still the price is very good for this one.
5,A National Treasure,"I've whistled and sung to Joe Hickerson's story songs for 40 years. This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and it travelled with me all over the country for several decades. The cover's full of coffee rings, burn marks, scrapes, scratches, gouges and puppy-chewed corners now. I've got it framed and up on the wall, and each time I glance at it, a song from it starts playing in my head. This album is simple perfection.Joe's pure, non-affected voice will both transport you and haunt you forever. I never tire of listening to this masterpiece of simplicity. Thank you, Joe Hickerson!"
3,Friends with money or no money,"I love Jennifer Aniston and would like to see her in any movie. Unfortunately, this one is not the best... There are a few interesting thoughts you might get after watching this movie re friends and money."
4,Why people rate this movie poorly,"If you haven't seen her previous film ""Lovely and Amazing"" you won't get the film. I think that is why people rate this movie poorly. They should rent a movie for its pure entertainment value and undimensional characters. This is a dialogue movie with intelligence."
2,Jennifer A. is a decent actress - but story line is sad,"I would have given this film a slightly higher rating had it been filled with characters I admired or to whom I related. I mean, Aniston's character gets set up with a real jerk by one of her best friends (who knows this guy talks disrespectfully about women). Aniston, meanwhile, does a good job of playing a depressed, too-nice to people character who gets taken advantage of.Catherine Keener's marriage seems troubled because she is overly concerned with other people's feelings and her husband seems blase about them, including those of his wife's.It's sort of an okay character driven movie in terms of the acting, but the ending is not pieced together in a gratifying way...it sort of just leaves you there hanging with nothing concluded."
1,TERRIBLE...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE! DONT WASTER YOUR TIME...YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU DID! IT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE AND HAD NO REAL PLOT!
1,Where's the plot?,Kept watching and waiting for the plot to reveal itself . . . and then the movie was over.
4,A Quiet Pleasure,"Some movies I go to see on the big screen with all it's bells' and whistles. Others I like to savor in my house, sitting on the couch and just reflecting on the story. I found this DVD to be one that I'll buy because I'll keep watching it again and again. I didn't find the story boring at all--it's not a huge thriller or mystery but more a ""slice of life"" of four friends. The husband everyone thinks that is gay and his frustrated wife, who doesn't wash her hair in quiet protest. The maid that squeezes out the last of her L'ancome eye cream and puts the high end stuff on her feet in defiance. I realize this movie won't appeal to everyone. It's actually more like reading a book and doing little character studies. I loved every actor in the movie; Joan Cusak was as great as always and Jennifer Aniston held her own. If you like quiet little movies, give this a go."
1,Disappointment,"All I can say is that I was incredibly disappointed in this movie. It lacked content worthy of a film so badly. I am a big fan of both Jennifer Aniston and Joan Cusack and I was psyched to see them together in a film, but both of their characters bored me. I found it to be a very forgetable story."
1,88 minutes I will never get back,Probably the worst movie I have ever been forced to watch. I cannot think of anything positive to say about this film.
2,forgetful,OK to watch once. Very forgetful. Nothing stands out. Kinda boring but not boring enough to stop watching after 10 minutes.
1,Where is this going?,"Bad. Not a good movie. I feel like to get the point across, the 4 principal's performances could have been slightly more vacant and detached. Shopgirl-esque, n'est pas? It just goes on and on, scenes upon scenes that don't really build upon anything or each other, and then it ends implausibly. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,"""Is That All There Is?""","I generally admire Jennifer Aniston's work so I picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn. Sadly, watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie. If you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes, you would't miss much since nothing really happens. If it's a comedy, it isn't funny. If it's a slice of life, the lives are deadly dull. The emotional level is so low-key you suspect the entire group is on valium. Jenifer Aniston especially, seems to have phoned this one in.Real characters? As it happens, I've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these sad-sack characters. If they're actually representative of real Americans then we're in big trouble! My wife & I had the same reaction at the end of this one ..... ""THAT""S IT??!!""."
2,Lifeless,"This lifeless ????? was pointless and plotless. When it ended, I gave it no more thought than breathing. I guess Jennifer needed the screen time and the other three needed the money."
2,"a Mr. Allen, Woody wannabe...","What the H E L L was this movie about? If you asked me I'd say ""bull crap"" for lack of better words. Its a bunch of couples and Jennifer Aniston moaping about melodramatic boring issues and having some of the most unintelligible conversations I have ever heard. If Woody Allen were dead he would roll over in his grave. This movie is an obvious attempt at his style and brand of motion picture.. However, even Allen's worse film is better than this! The film doesnt even try to answer the questions it asks and, nothing could have been worse than the abrupt and pointless ending. The all star cast probably questioned what they signed onto after seeing the final cut.. Skip this!!"
1,"No sale, I am afraid","Being a Jennifer Aniston fan, I bought this film sight unseen. YOu would think that they would make full use of her. You would think. But, the role was so narrow (acting wise), with no risks. The script was tepid at best. The director has all the power in the world. As a male fan, I do not ask for 'unclothing' or anything of the sort. However, if I pay to see a beautiful actress like Ms.Aniston, I would appreciate outfits more daring than were evident here; my grandma wore more daring things. The film was so clean, so unracy, it could have been screened at a corn husking gathering in 1890, one of their 'magic lantern' shows. Even back then, the men would've grumbled, ""Geez, perhaps she could've worn shorts, maybe a bathing suit, heaven forbid..."""
3,Another Jennifer Aniston sad sack movie,"This reminds me of ""The Good Girl,"" though that was a better film, in which Aniston also played a semi blue collar type. This one makes her a little more upscale, but still playing someone poor. All I could picture was the mansion she lived in with Brad Pitt. The cast is stellar here, and the script is serviceable. It's a pleasant enough indie diversion, but the Earth won't move for you as you watch it pass by."
1,Wizzardmom,This is the first movie I've ever rated. I didn't get to the comedy or romance. I lasted 30 minutes. (The showtime was 5:30. I was requesting my money back at 6:30.) I found the movie depressing. Not one person in the movie was happy. They were all just going through the motions.
3,"not bad, but need some patience to sit thru","this obviously was a low budget movie. those castings played those so-called 'rich' friends didn't look a bita rich, their residences also looked so cheap, the cars driven by them also looked so basic. there's no proof that these people were rich. but in general, this is not a bad movie with not a so bad screenplay."
2,This isn't Annie Hall,Mildly entertaining and interesting but all the treads are unresolved. This film maker may be attempting to do on the West Coast what Woody Allen did on the East coast but forget about it. Annie Hall this is not. Jennifer is not Diane Keaton !
1,Don't Waste Your Friends' Time or Your Money,"Don't waste your time on this movie. I saw it for free and still felt robbed! (A friend rented it.)The plot--as best as I could discern one--seemed to be something along the lines of ""Life is a mess, feel free to despair amongst yourselves."" If I want stories about despair, I'll just stay at work. (I work in ER's and an Urgent Care Clinic)Interwoven through this overriding theme of despair, the values and morals showcased in this movie are typically Hollywood these days--that is to say, abysmal to non-existent.What a waste of some otherwise great talent. Joan Cusack in particular is WAY above this movie. Her agent should be fired, and then shot for letting her take this movie.I would rather sell my TV than watch this movie again!!!"
2,too much reality and not enough laughter,"Was looking forward to seeing this film, quite disappointing. Joan Cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film. Once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing. Jennifer Anniston is usually pretty good, but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny, I felt. Just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line.Not a film I will be watching again, sadly."
2,just aight,"trying to make this film into a 90 minute version of 'Sex in the City"" doesn't fully work. the lives of the Women are interesting,but the Problem is that the film isn't written well enough to fully develop everybody's role&there full being. this film leaves alot of unanswered Questions. Frances mcdormand does her best Dennis Leary Impersonation here.. Jennifer Aniston is cute,but her acting is wack.nothing new there. the film just throws things out there,but has no real meaning or anything strong to tie it all together. this film wanted to be the ""ordinary People"" for it's time period, instead it's a mis-guided attempt at being all things to some people&coming up empty in the big picture."
3,Not the best movie I have seen!!,"Was alright, but dragged along. Was not what I had hoped it would be. Very blan!! Would not watch again as I have several of my many other purchases!!"
1,Wake me up when it's over,Please tell me there aren't really people like this in the real world. Not one likable character in the lot.Seniors standing in line waiting to order at McDonald's are more interesting that this. Does anyone have a coupon?
1,A Bad Cinderella Story,"I had to wade through several 4 star ratings to find one honest review. Was this social commentary? And if so, what is the comment? Perhaps it is ""no matter what sort of person you are, you may end up hitting the jackpot and marrying money so you can be financially secure like your friends."" I suppose Hollywood likes a story like this one: Emotionally and financially bankrupt woman stoops to men who use her, stealing, hang-up calls to her ex and finally to going out with a man she believes is a looser, only to find...HE'S RICH!!! It's like a Cinderella story where the part of Cinderella is played by the step-mother."
3,For the 35+year old viewer only,"If you are not at least in your mid-thirties you will not get anything out of this movie, so do not bother seeing it. You really need at least 15 or 20 post college years under you belt before this movie you will resonate with you at all.As a woman in that 35 and above range, I found this movie really interesting. It is not particularly funny, certainly not uplifting,was pretty leisurely paced, and with a lot of characters who mostly made me feel irritated and impatient. But it is a very true slice of life in which I can see my life and the lives of my married friends."
3,Glimpse into the lives of friends with money......,"Not a bad movie, not a great one either. Good acting by the cast. Story line could have had a better ending instead of the one that leaves you hanging.The movie contrasts three married couples with ""money"" to that of a single female without money..... all of them are friends.This movie's main focus seems to be that no matter if you are rich or poor, you still have problems and that money doesn't solve everything. With the rich folks, their problems just don't involve money! They just have problems that are different from their single, female friend!"
1,Disappointing,"I wouldn't normally go running for a Jennifer Aniston film, but with Frances McDormand, Catherine Keener and Joan Cusack in this film, I thought it couldn't be bad. Maybe more of an indie flick than big budget Hollywood waste of time. Yes it COULD be bad. As some of the previous reviewers detailed so well, the characters are quirky (GOOD) but not well developed (BAD). There isn't one character you could really get behind, understand or have empathy for. Jennifer Aniston's character is an unmotivated maid, but she has such good values that she says she doesn't smoke her client's pot, that would be wrong. But she does steal their expensive face cream to use on her feet and also uses their sex toys. Huh? And the whole message about money - ""is having money so good after all?"" OK. But again, not well developed (BAD). The ending -- to use monetary terms -- is a SELL-OUT and CHEAP. Don't get fooled by a semi-great cast. This movie is a waste of time."
5,Just started....,"I just started giving these to my 8 1/2 yr old border collie. She seems to like them, easy to chew for her and I assume the flavoring is good because she gobbles them up."
4,Good Product at a Good Price,"This provides good nutrition and a large dog only requires 2 tablets so it is cost effective. However my dog does not like the taste, so I have to put it in lunch meat."
2,not so tasty,I have a dog who will eat ANYTHING... and even he doesn't really like these. They must taste like a vitamin.
4,"8 in 1 Excel Time Release Senior Dog Multi-Vitamins Tabs, 100 Count...",They say when they make dog food they put everything in it that the dog would need but who knows.The vitamin could not hurt I guess and it seems like my pets move and look a little better and I've been giving it to them for years.
2,Matter of taste,"These look like the PetTabs we had been using, but my dogs don't like the taste. They considered their vitamins a treat so taste is important."
3,Not satisfied,"I have a pug with chronic skin problems and I was really hoping that this would be the ""wonder"" product. He still has skin problems. I think his coat might be a little bit better but he still has lots of flakes and itchy skin."
5,Great Deal!,"After much research, I purchased these several months ago. We have 2 senior beagle boys, and we've been giving these senior multi vitamins to them every morning. The tabs are easily ground up, added to their food, (as they are finicky about anything resembling meds), and by adding some warm water, it makes a great gravy on the food. There has been a big improvement in both of them, but mostly in our 11 year old (the older one). The longer he takes the vitamins, the more ""spurts of energy"" he seems to have. With the added lutein (not in many other senior vitamins!) in the tabs, they both have also shown improvement in their failing eye sight."
3,Vitamins Crumbled when Received,"My dogs seem to like the flavor of these vitamins, and the ingredients are what I desired; however, upon receipt almost a third of the tablets had crumbled and turned to powder in the bottle. They are within the valid use date, and I just think the packaging needs to be more protective if the tablets are this fragile. Will not re-purchase due to loss of usable product in shipping."
3,Vitamins were crumbling,"When the vitamins arrived some of them had already crumbled in the plastic container. This tells me the journey was rough, or the vitamins are old. I won't buy them again because my chihuahua won't eat them even if I break it into four pieces... Skip buying this one, and get another brand..."
2,Not Happy!,Product received not as described as it did not contain Lutein. Am returning product-hopefully next time will receive product as described. Then will update review.
3,interesting but not perfect at all,"EVA has little relation with actual stock price. (Do not believe all what this book says.) Its concept is great because it explicitly includes cost of capital. Now there are some other more refined concepts than EVA, which are worth studying and applying more."
5,A great book!,"I like this book very much, and it is helping me at work. I would like to know if you'll have a Spanish version soon. If so, where can I get it here in Mexico."
3,"Yeahhhhh, but......","I still love Gladys - whenever and for whatever reason she opens her mouth - but, for some reason, I can't get Gladys and these songs to do justice to each other. There's some verve missing, and it may be technique...or it may be that the orchestration and arrangements here are too ""finished"" for this gutsy and raw soul diva. There are many other Gladys things I like so much better."
2,"Gladys Knight Surpresses Her True Soul...That's A ""No No""","I couldn't believe my ears! Now that's a dull cliche isn't it? Gladys Knight nearly put me to sleep! I was expecting Ms. Knight to be MS. KNIGHT, not some scared little singer with no confidence in her OWN talent of interpreting songs HER WAY.When Aretha Franklin was 20, she sang the Holy hell out of Billie Holiday's ""God Bless The Child,"" but did it HER way. She even took Ruth Etting's ""You Made Me Love You,"" and transformed the tune into an Aretha masterwork (she was 19).Gladys, go back and pull out your Doris Day records. Now SHE could sing this music in the way that an expert POP singer could. I love you, Miss Knight, but somebody gave you the wrong advice here."
2,Gladys should not have done this one,"This CD is full of wonderful classics, songs that I have loved for years. However, Gladys Knight takes something very special away from these songs on this CD. I didn't like the way she sung many of the selections. She should stick with what she is known for...soulful singing...not blues classics."
1,"A Long, Tedious, Sleepless Knight","I love Gladys Knight (I've seen her live three times in the last year, for example.) I anticipated this collection with great expectations and can't even listen to it. I still love her rich, unique voice, but her vocals seem unmotivated, unmoving and forced. I don't buy any of it. I've heard her sing some of these live and the CD versions pale by comparison. Many of the arrangements seem to have been picked up in the discard bin and her vocals appear to have all be laid down in a short afternoon. Gladys: you can do SO much better - I know, I've heard you do it."
1,Gladys needs her Pips before these...,"I am and always will be an ardent admirer and fan of Ms Knight but talk about a long days journey into knight. This is dreadful. I don't know what it is, the choice of songs, the orchestration, the arrangements, the fact that her voice (an instrument unto itself) is much too soulful and full bodied for strolls down 'memory lane' or all of the above but this combination does not work for me. True, it's not as bad as some of these latter day ain'ts but I think she would have fared much, much better if she had covered some of her OWN hits and arranged them to suit the times. Please don't let this bring out a full fledged assault by Patti LaBelle and/or Aretha. That's all we need."
3,EVERGREEN,"Ms Knight may have a lesser range in her tessitura compared to Franklin. But if her register is less epanded she covers up for it in her outstanding presence and vocal texture. Ms Knight, thanks to her clever singing technique, have yet decades left to continue her precious singing and enchant several generations with her soulish bravura and surpremecy.It is true, that an artist that have produced tons of albums, may have difficulties in continous development and ms Knight sometimes goes for easy targets with mainstream ballads but who inte world does them better than Ms Knight ? Much as I hate the idea that she has been exiled in Las Vegas I have to surrender to the market forces as much as everybody else and to see an endless stream of new capable singers launched every month and gone by the hour. Ms Knight, howevere, is an evergreen and therefore she may go on spellbinding us with her sensual, vibrato tremoli for decades to come. Brava, Gladys ! You show them, girl !! Douglas Modig"
5,Buy this!,"Gladys, thank you for making this album! I love re-inventions of standards and my goodness, how Gladys has brought these songs back to life. So mellow, so controlled yet also sounding carefree - this is a wonderful CD and I sincerely hope we'll see ""Before Me, Vol. 2"" one day!"
1,Is not to it is my anticipation much to my regret,My anticipation to the better disk including good music of singer from the first line that I am very love her much to my regret this disk not convinced me.
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to see another CD from Gladys Knight but this is not what I expected. Usually Gladys portrays feeling and emotion in her renditions. This CD is flat and unemotional. If she is thankful to those before her for their songs she doesn't show it. I thought she would take great songs and make them her own as much as she could but there is no depth. It is as if she is reading a telephone book. I like Gladys but this is not a CD,if you like her too, to purchase. I am disappointed because I know she could do better. I wish she did."
3,Gladys What Happened?,"What a snoozer! So much could have been done on this CD to refresh these standards AND display miss Knight's capabilities, so disappointing. Don't get me wrong, Before Me isn't bad, so much as ""been done before"". I adore miss Knight's past work, but perhaps her voice is not up to it now. This is definitely for her fans, so I'll just hang on to ""memories""."
5,Polished and Sophisticated,"I was just a tad cautious about the album only because the 'Great Standards' have been done by many, some done better than others. But I am thrilled with what Gladys has put together with the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. Everything is just right - not over done - not underdone and still maintains the spirit of the originals but allows Gladys to show her own. Not a 'copy' job but inspired. Not always an easy task. There is a respect and love that shows through this album. Thank you Gladys for a job beautifully done. All those BEFORE YOU are smiling with appreciation. I'm giving this lovely CD as gifts. Who wouldn't be pleased?"
5,Have an exquisite tree!,"Your Christmas tree will be exquisite with these on it! I purchased one box at a local closeout 3 years ago and was sad that I couldn't get any more. This year, I found them on Amazon and was thrilled, so I bought 3 more boxes for my 9 foot tree.I get compliments from everyone that sees my tree. These flicker just like real candle flames and look better and better the more you perch them on the tips of the branches, as you would with a real candle.Simply remove a bulb from your existing light strand, pop in the candle's plug, and clip the candle light to a branch tip. Enjoy the warmth and flicker of realistic-looking candles.Trust me, these are worth every penny and you really do not need many candles on your tree to get an awesome lighting effect! You will love these and so will your guests!"
4,Joys & Inspirations,And yet another beautiful CD by Steven Hall. The perfect CD for when I seek quietness and stillness within my soul.
2,Not worth it....,"So I bought these right after x-mas waiting for spring to come. I finally wore them out today and they are made very poorly. Living in Seattle...it rains and once these got wet they turned a funny color and started tearing tiny lines into whatever kind of material these are made out of. They are cute...they run really small. If you live in a place where they wont get wet go for it, but I wouldn't buy these again. They get two stars just for looking nice on."
2,MODERN FRANKENSTEIN ALMOST,"A serial killer's body is used in a cell regeneration experiment with expected results. John-Damon Charles (Eric Roberts light) stars as the detective hunting the serial killer who has headed back to his old hide-out which is now being cleaned by 5 women doing community service.As a Razor movie, it has its mandatory ""one object in the eye"" death scene. The special effects were cheap. The acting was a step up from most cheap horror films, but was severely hampered by the script. The killings were for the most part not shown, only the bodies. The film never developed, nor did the characters. It was done done in a hurried fashion. Notice the microphone at the top of the screen in the first lab scene.No real sex, no nudity. 2 stars is generous."
3,Mediocre Romance in Historical Setting,"I certainly wish I had read all the reviews before I wasted my time and money, and I most definitely will not seek out further books from this author. I don't know enough about this period to know whether the period, people, dress and customs were accurately described. The main characters were all fiction, and not terribly well developed. Towards the end I was skipping through the final battle scenes to finish it and get to the happy ending (semi happy).If you find it used for $1 and have a rainy Sunday to waste go ahead, but otherwise skip this -- there are much better historical romances and specifically historical fiction, of which this is not."
1,Hadrians Wall,"Trite, predictable, anacronistic ... the writer should really do some research into the period before he writes a novel about it. If you're looking for good historic fiction go elsewhere. It's nowhere near the caliber of O'Brien or Forrester for example -- simply a generic (and uninteresting) story with 3rd century Britian as an incidental backdrop."
5,Great WYSIWYG web builder program.,"I started my web page (...) using an online page builder. A good way to start, but not very creative. I then moved up to Adobe PageMill which gave me even more opportunity to design the look I wanted. When I decided on Dreamweaver, it was out of a desire to make my page look even better, and work across platforms. It does the trick.The program is extremely user friendly and easy to learn. Always a good thing when you're dealing with a limited schedule. The FTP interface even makes sure your support files go with the html page. All in all, a must have for the web head in you."
1,"Bugs, bugs, wonderful bugs...","Dreamweaver is the most horrid, repulsive web design software ever written for the Mac. I am warning you, fellow Mac users. Macromedia must have bought a can of ladybugs and dropped them in the beta tester's brains-I can't believe that they missed some very important bugs-the site map doesn't work, and there is no cross-platform compatibility. Do not buy this. Please look into GoLive by Adobe."
2,"Dated, but for the time a good read.","The only other bad review on here, at 3 stars, is 100% accurate.Good person, but it's clear looking at current resources his plans didn't work out.(The wikipedia page is heavily skewed and lacking information for such a prolific person)On a less personal note, as a business major with interests in robotics, most of this book is awful advice, almost none of the companies he uses as successful examples haven't gone bankrupt.Excellent advice for being a startup writer/photographer in the 70's,otherwise heavy on personal buzzwords that would never catch on,and dated language/lack of internet advice makes it a fun older pamphlet style book(It feels VERY much like it's just a collection of his articles)"
3,It's C-Rayz thats about all I can say,"This album is pretty much a mixtape of a bunch of C-Rayz Walz' tracks outside of his Def Jux releases. Its mixed terribly, and some of the tracks are low quality. The songs are by C-Rayz so they are good throughout, but you've probably heard them before if you're reading this. This whole thing seems rushed and unecessary. Pick up Ravipops, or The Limelight if you can find it, and avoid this."
4,1975: Return Of The Beast,"This is a great collection of tracks but like said before by other reviewers, the songs cut out funny from one track to the next. There seems to be a 2 sec. delay or so. Another complaint would be that the songs do not blend at all. Its organization is very sloppy. The High Points-- C-Rayz' is a lyrical beast and the beats that he's rockin to are dope. For fans I do recommend this, but for heads who are new to him I would suggest that you start elsewhere. Peace!"
5,Yoga for Young at Heart: Gentle Stretching Exc. for Seniors,"Originally I purchased this book for my 83-year old Mother. When it arrived I decided to do the exercises so I could better help her. Well, I fell in love with the feeling the yoga exercises in this book gave my body. I have exercised regularly for over 5 years and was active prior to that. Before reading this book, my exercise routine involved limited stretches prior to working out with free weights. Now, the yoga exercises found in this book, added to my daily routine of weight lifting, have brought a sense of balance to my body.Highly recommend this book."
3,Yoga for seniors,"I just started Yoga class and thought this book would be helpful. Since I am 85, I didn't want any floor positions, however, the book included more floor positions than I am capable of,so that was disappointing. There were only a few ""upright"" positions so I am trying them."
3,If you have more than one book on Yoga...,"I found the written directions adequate, but the total presentation is only fair. Some of the photographs (all black and white) are worthless, because arms, legs and torso are all the same shade of grey."
1,Incorrect information,"This book was very badly researched. Julius C. Loftin was my great grandfather. The author has part of the information correct, his birth place, his Civil War Record, the name of my great grandmother and where they were married. However, he listed his birthday wrong, ALL of his children wrong (I should know who my grandfather and father were!), his death date wrong and the place that he died and is buried wrong.I contacted the publisher about this mistake and they said that they would pass the information on to the author. However, I have never heard a word from the publisher again or from the author.I was so livid with rage at this mistake that I did not bother with the rest of the book even though many of my ancestors were listed in it.Save your money on this one. You can get the book through interlibrary loan if you just must see it, but please keep in mind it was done by a 27 year old who probably has very little interest in YOUR history."
5,Great inexpensive keyboard,"My last keyboard was an expensive Saitek gaming keyboard. I loved the weight of it, but found the lit keys really were not helpful and there was no way to clean it due to the extensive electronics inside. I bought this one as a replacement. There are some great cheap keyboards out there that I have been pleased with, but this one stands out. I love the way the keys respond and how the feet that tilt the keyboard actually STAY in that position if you want them to. All others I have used collapse back in the minute you pick it up, put it in your lap, etc. I plan on buying about 3 more of these to have as backups. I love it!"
4,Very Good Keyboard,"This keyboard was easy to install - no need for the CD on XP. Can't beat the price with free shipping to boot. This keyboard replaced a Dell that came with my Dimension desktop and is virtually identical in feel. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is the "" - "" on the numerical keypad is not a sensitive as I am used to."
3,keyboard,all keys are working OK. The 'backspace' key quits working after a few days of usage; I had to use the 'left arrow' key now for 'backspace' or going back. The price should be cheaper.
4,good overview for new professionals,"good general overview of how to treat children whove experienced a crisis. the material on assessment is very helpful and detailed. each chapter is writen by an expert in a particular area of childhood crisis. since the book covers so many potential sources of trauma, there isn't really as much in-depth coverage of each topic as i would've liked to see. the book seems to be geared more to entry level professionals than to those experienced in dealing with childhood crisis and trauma."
3,Overpriced,"At $10/piece, this set is way overpriced, especially for a ""Made in China"" set. It's fine, but not very heavy and nothing really special about it. Look for the higher-quality ""Made in Japan"" stainless sets by Yamazaki at this price-point."
5,One Great Book!,"Tears came to my eyes as I read this book. This touched my heart so, I can't even begin to explain except, if you don't know much about the war, and want to delve into it, this is the book. I am not a person to even BEGIN to read about War, but yet this book drew me nearer and nearer until I could not put it down until I was done, and then I read it again! If you have a father, grandfather, that was in the war, this is abook to read to understand the generation gaps! A wonderful, well written, and exciting book."
5,Great book!,This is a well-written book that gave me a look at what it was like for brave pilots flying Jugs and Lightnings during WWII. It's nice to have veterans share their experiences with us so that younger generations never forget our history.
3,"good review, campy delivery","I am mid 20's, about to finish a military enlistment and preparing to return to college. This program was very good at refreshing concepts and providing alot of practice tests. However the method of delivery is campy. It feels like it was prepared for a 6th grade audience, cartoon like sound effects, silly music, etc. I would have given this 4 stars if the maturity level of delivery was more in line with the 16-18 year audience it should be aimed at."
1,Faulty Software,"When my daughter used this product, it did not save the scores on her practice, so she could not progress through the program. This is a major flaw."
1,USB1,"This was a great idea at the time. Unfortunately that was many years ago.It's not even worth having around for the ""neato"" factor."
3,A good supplement,"This is a collection of historical news footage showing the president during various activities. It's like watching those silent screens all over again. What is hard is knowing what exactly is going on as there is no sound nor any introduction via slide or sign saying what is going on. This makes the video worthless by itself, and at times hard to discern due to the age of the original recordings, but great for avid history/Roosevelt buffs.I bought this thinking I could use it in a high school classroom, but unless I do a grand introduction beforehand, won't be able to do so."
5,"Great Service, Good condition, Fast shipping","The book came as described, which was new! and in a timely fashion. Service was great, I plan on buying more books through Amazon."
3,Shotgun approach --> hit or miss,"I used this book as a way to refresh my perspective on a mystery novel after finishing a second draft. I highlighted perhaps a dozen relevant/useful passages in the entire 300-page book. There are a handful of interesting ideas, but the biggest challenge I encountered is that the quality of the advice is entirely dependent on the author of each chapter - so, if what you want to learn about happens to have been written about by an average advice-giver, you're out of luck. For a better treatment - more concise and productive, and of better quality throughout - consider Hallie Ephron's ""Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel."""
4,Great Help,I have other books concerning this subject. What I like about this book is that it contains chapters by different authors. There is nothing like hearing advice from the very authors that you enjoy reading so much.
3,Very catchy love-it-or-hate-it indie pop from Barcelona! - 3.5 stars,"As I've stated in other Barcelona reviews, this is the kind of band that you either love or hate. You either love the singer's voice (which sounds nerdy and gentle) and nerdy lyrics or you can't stand it. If you like it, however, you're in for a treat. This album is arguably their worst, and they clearly don't mind what people think of their music (I refuse to believe they don't know their music is cheesy. I guess they just love making songs). I do like the band even with all of its obvious faults, and fans of Barcelona will no doubt like this album. There's definitely some bad songs and overall the album's uneven, but it's a satisfying purchase nonetheless. Definitely not for everyone, though. Recommended for Barcelona fans as well as the curious.Highlights include:""Why Do You Have So Much Fun Without Me?""""Sunshine Delay""""Indian Names"" (to an extent)""C-64""""Fabled Age"" (kind of)""Unreal""""Summer Songs""""The Downside Of Computer Camp"""
5,Stereo Mount,"Great price. From the picture I wasn't sure if this was the item required, but the price was right to take a chance and it turned out to be exactly the right item."
2,"Rah, rah!","A fluffy bit of propaganda written in the form of a journal, but occasionally apostrophizing the reader none-the-less. More like novel, a bad one where characters are thin, events are hackneyed, and idiom is cliched. Intent is to portray to Americans the courage & character of Brits & their fighter pilots during the Battle of Britain, through a compendium of tales fictionalized for retelling. Interesting for its 1941 idiom and occasional oblique mention of new weaponry, such as radar and proximity fuses. Amusing, too, for moral values that produced shame then, but seem laughable today. But taken whole, a wide-eyed account of life on an air base from the point of view of a socially, politically and militarily correct scion of Britannia. Not a novel of war like ""The Cruel Sea"" or journalism like Casey's ""And I was There,"" but readable. Nothing more than an an adult version of ""Dave Dawson in the R.A.F,"" except that Ayling feels obliged to kill off his hero in the last paragraph."
1,"Fake Dr., Bad Book.","This guy is not a Doctor of ANYTHING! The book is terrible., January 2, 2006Reviewer: Kimberly Mound ""TT"" (Deland, Florida) - See all my reviewsFirst, this guy recieved his ""doctorate"" from a degree mill, a BS school in California called the Columbia Pacific University closed down as a degree mill by law enforcement ... www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/cpu.html . So, he is a fake doctor who is probably breaking the law by going by the title in several states.This is a book full of creative ways to shape children into frustrated adults who have no capability of surviving the struggles of life in the 21 century."
3,Fair,"Got mine yesterday and out of curiosity after reading another review I put a kill-a-watt on it and tested it out.Yes there is a ""chirp"" sound when it turns itself on from sleep mode. It doesn't border me however since it is not that loud and it only does once. In sleep mode, it draws about 20w. Awaked but not playing any big sound, it draws about 25w. Basically the sleep mode is really pointless.I have other JBL Studio L series speakers and I can tell the big difference over those home theater speakers. But this sub I really don't hear or feel any difference. A boom is just a boom."
3,Good quality but just don't use it,"It's a good quality product, but i just don't use it any more. Probably used it only one time.Intended to protect my camera when I place my camera in my messenger bag, but my 5D with grip is just too big to throw in my side bag.Can't really bring my large camera out without bringing a dedicated camera bag. the smaller version on a standard low range slr should be fine though and may get more use out of it."
3,HAVENT WE HEARD THIS ALL BEFORE??,"dunno where to start here...the sticker on the packaging makes a reference to Slayer,which i hear.question is,isnt ONE Slayer enough??i was really anticipating this release,maybe that explains some of my disappointment.dont get me wrong,this is a pretty solid release i guess i just appreciated their former ""really heavy,metal- infused ROCK"" slant versus the current full-on METAL assault.Joe preston provides the Bass,and it might as well be anybody cause i cant hear it thru Matt's guitar.i should mention that the real star of this show is the amazing Drumming!!kinda tribal & groovy."
3,"Freight Train through the Gloomy forest in your Brain, but lacks aggression.","Fast, grinding, good fun. Read the other positive reviews. High on Fire are at the top of their genre. They only get 3 stars though, because the guitar player is sloppy sloppy sloppy. Great song writing, bone-splintering heavy, fast, and soulful. But! Matt Pike strums the guitar strings like a sloppy punk rocker on speed. If he had a tighter right hand picking style, we can only imagine how aggressive this album would be! I think this album would rival ""Master of Puppets"" if Matt would just be disciplined enough to learn proper thrash guitar technique (read ""All downstrokes at speeds less than 200 bpm). Because of their lacadazical, stoner approach to metal, they will never rival Slayer or Entombed, early Metallica etc. But, then they might not be High on Fire, singing songs about alcoholism, dope, and bad times. Do we want High on Fire to do their homework? Nah..."
1,ROXIO SUCKS,"I bought a ROXIO program hoping to be a good adder to a new HP for photo, video, DVD use etc. It hangs up... is painfully slow and isnt worth the frustration you experience using it. It looks easy, but is seriously limited. You buy this program to be be offered the higher end version after you install. That is just bait and switch. You are better off using windows movie maker for your slides/movie and other pre-installed apps in your system or find a better software company that offers a better product. I wish I read the majority of these reviews first... they all seem to be exactly what I experienced with ROXIO.On a side note, I find it funny how ""people"" give the product great reviews when they only base the rating on gettting the product fast. Buying junk and getting it fast isnt worth of a very good rating for the product. The seller may be good, but in this case Roxio sucks. This is the last Roxio product I waste $$ on."
1,All Roxio DVD creator versions are worse than a virus,"These products are atrocious.Eventually the update manager takes over your computer and can't be shut down. It keeps trying to MAKE you install a valid update using discs.You can't make it go away on Windows XP or 7, and it prevents uninstall because it won't shut down no matter how many times you try.AVOID ANY ROXIO PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS!Roxio Creator 2011"
1,A scam,"About the worst product I have ever purchased for my computer. I wish I'd read some reviews first.It basically locks up in Windows XP when you insert a commercial DVD. Not only that, but you cannot kill it through the Task Manager (if you run Task Manager before starting Easy DVD Copy) - and even worse, you cannot invoke Task Manager after starting Easy DVD Copy and it locks up. You cannot even shut down or reboot at this point. You have to pull out the power cord from your computer to get Roxio to stop running.So, this is about the most inexorably invasive non-functioning program I've ever run on XP. The only DVD I could copy was the DVD the program was distributed on. I hope I can get a refund as it's really worthless."
1,"Total Con- Useless ""program""- don't waste your money!!!!!!",DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!This program advertises that it will allow you to make backup copies of DVDs...WRONG!!!They forget to mention that ANY DVD-burning program will do the same thing as this (even free ones)!ONLY HOME MOVIES CAN BE COPIED. This software WON'T work on any encrypted DVDs (read: only works on public service announcements and home movies) which you can already duplicate with any other program.
1,Sorry I bought it :(,"I couldn't backup any of the DVDs in my realatively large collection. My copy of this program is going into the trash can, that's how much I like it."
1,The only reason I gave it 1 star is that you can't go lower!!!,"This stupid piece of software is absolute JUNK, USELESS or WORSE. If you copy DVD to DVD, It won't even play the copy, on anything. Customer support is NON-EXISTANT. They won't let you email them, if you want to talk to them, it is $35, they don't give you an address to write to, so, I guess they just sell junk and since you can't contact them, how do you get your money back? YOU DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!I sure wish I had read the reviews before I bought this worthless piece of garbage."
1,roxio sucks,"For any people who plan to by this product, remember this, 90 % of all of Roxio's software gets embeded in the system files of the OS. As this reason is mainly the cause of lockups and not being able to access other programs while this one is running, all roxio software should be avoided. The programmers of this software mainly manfacture this for proprietary machines i.e.. dell, gateway, compaq in which most programs are usually connected to other programs and reporting software via software patches. This is the main reason why all of these systems do not come with an OEM copy of any software like Windows or driver disks for any internal hardware componets. For a good product look to DVD X Copy, I know this program still works even though the earlier versions were less of a hassle to have and cost a whole lot less, these newer versions still offer almost the same grade of reliability. And remember you get what you pay for..."
2,"Way, way overpriced","It's definitely worth having a spare battery for your Xacti, but the Sanyo offering is very overpriced. I went to a well known auction site and got a third party battery with exactly the same specs for less than a quarter of the price. Same performance so far."
2,1-year life from this expensive battery!,"I cycled this battery in my Xacti camera charger perhaps two dozen times over the course of a year and it's already dead. That's better than the cheap ""Techstep"" batteries I purchased on ebay (they lasted about 3 months) but still totally unacceptable. I expect 2-3 years out of a Li battery that is only occasionally cycled (shelf life limited rather than cycle life limited)."
3,Does what it says but overpriced,"First of all, get the OEM ones by Sanyo only.Don't buy those aftermarket units, they don't last as long after charge and the life expectancy is just too short.I bought 2 aftermarket units from Newegg.com and one of them, after just 2 charges, the center part of the battery started to bulge out and doesn't hold the charges.The OEM ones, including one I got from Amazon (I got the camcorder from Amazon, see my other review of the HD700), holds the charge better. But an inherent issue with the battery and camcorder, if you use it for over 10 mins continuously for a single shooting, it get pretty hot in your hand.So far the unit has been performing as it should, allowing about 45 mins of video and a couple hundred pictures; as described. I just thought being so expensive, it should provide a longer charge for video time.Frankly, buyers don't have much choice. You can risk buying the aftermarket ones or pay higher price and get the quality OEM ones.Happy shopping!"
3,Info: This Afterhours is NOT Lou Reed,"Afterhours by the Carol Lou Trio appeared on the ""Everything you've ever heard"" boot. The only connection with Lou Reed is that two different Mr Reed's coincidentally both wrote songs called Afterhours. This is not the Velvet Underground song, no Velvet Underground member played on it, Lou Reed did not write it. I believe the Carol Lou Song dates from the 1970s! The other 5 songs are Kosher....An earlier book of VU lyrics had questionable legality, inaccurate lyrics and a bootleg disc of Ride Into The Sun. This time, we've started off with inaccurate info and I guess dubious legality of the CD. This bodes ill for contents of the book: I hope I'm wrong."
3,"Average, not very detailed.","I checked this book out from the school library about 2 yearsago...This book is what the title says: The History of Rock and Roll.This book uses big text and a lot of photographs. It doesn't really gointo detail about the artists, but it does mention them and it showsthe evolution of rock and roll really well. One part of the book Ilike is the Suggested Listening section, showing music from the50s-90s. This book covers the beginning of rock and roll all the wayto the grunge era, a little after Cobain's death. If you are lookingfor a book that shows the evolution of rock, this is the book. If youare looking for detailed information on the artists of rock and rollthroughout history, this isn't it.3 out of 5 stars."
2,In Reference to Moshe...,"This book isn't really that good and doesn't compare to many, many other books about rock and roll out there. Get The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock or ""Rock and Roll Year By Year"" instead. However, this review is in reference to Moshe's review (below). ""Here, There and Everywhere"" was released by the Beatles on ""Revolver"" in August 1966. ""Pet Sounds"" came out in May 1966."
3,Slightly better than Average,this Book is alright for a starter type of book but it doesn't fully grasp all the information one would want in such a Important Heading.when you see a Book that says the History of Rock&Roll you are expecting a Full overview&Insights left&right&this Book doesn't do that.but it's still a Interesting read nevertheless.
5,Awesome,"Reviewed for web site:- whats that fish. Wonderful book, full of pictures and information, a must have for any diver going to these areas!"
5,"Great Reference, comb format is perfect","I first saw this book (and its companion books on Fish and Coral) on a dive boat in Cozumel. I searched for the comb binding based on reviews that said they were lighter. After using them it appears the even greater benefit is that they lie flat, remaining open on the page you want to compare your photos to!"
5,Excellent reference information,"The entire process of ordering and receiving this book was better than I expected. The book was in ""like new"" condition and just what I was looking for."
5,"So Sick , Its Ill","This is one of the best hip hop cd's ever produced.Chops spins this cd into a new dimension.A must have, If you want the best in life"
5,"A ""Master"" book","This is a great book for genealogical researchers- for beginners or seasoned researchers, this book will give you the places to either start your search, or give you ideas on places you have not thought of."
3,Not the best for geographic place names,"We were looking for a book that explained the origin of Irish place names, but this wasn't it. This is a fine book for genealogical researchers, as it associates surnames with places. If you're looking for the Irish Gaelic origins of place names, try to find a copy of ""Dictionary of Irish Place Names"" by Adrian Room. We were glad to score the last copy from a distributor.I'm sure Mr. O'Laughlin is a great researcher in his field, but I'm disappointed that we were a bit misled by this book's title and didn't find what we were looking for. I'm sure we'll put the book to good use eventually, though!"
3,Disappointing,"A real diappointment if, like me, you expected thi s book to be about Schoon and his beard. The author barely mentions Roy or any of his disciples. A great book about Purslow and Honest Pat needs to be written. This is not it."
2,Few Excuses for a disappointing lack of Beard info,"It's the same story isn't it. I came to this book expecting to lern more aboud John Schoon, beards, difs and other assorted disciple issues. New to this ever expanding world of Schoonism..brr nothing, I'm willing to learn more but this wasn't the book. I would direct the enthusiastic learner to 'Man on the Roof - Schoon and the fear of flying' or the much maligned 'Kirsten... Slag'. The Schoon royble however has to be 'Schoony Schoony Dif Dif'. Buy that, not this."
5,This timer fits the bill,"I purchased this timer so I could time things wherever I was. I liked the idea that it could time 2 intervals at a time. I have used it for several months and have found it to work flawlessly. It is clipped to a stationary item which holds it up for easy viewing. The desired time is easy to set up and stop. The adequately-loud alarm sounds for a few minutes, but eventually turns off without my intervention."
4,Solid Choice,"I bought this timer for my wife as a Christmas present. We both like the look of the timer and the fact that it has two separate timers so that you can keep track of two things at once. The alarm is loud enough to be heard from outside the kitchen, but it's not so loud that it hurts your ears when it goes off.Pros:- Easy to Operate- Durable- Nice Look- Not too quiet, not too loud- 1 AAA battery (not included)- Clip on back with a magnet for refrigerator mounting- Clip can be held open so that it can stand up on a counter surfaceCons:- Numbers are always on if there is a battery installedOverall, if you need a simple digital timer to help you in the kitchen this is a good choice and we are satisfied with it!"
4,Exactly as promised.,Working exactly as promised with good construction. Not going for full five stars yet because I have not used it long enough. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,Didn't work,"The plus I'll give this timer is that the magnet on the back is indeed strong. However, I couldn't get it to turn on, so I returned it. I'm going with theMulti Timerinstead, which I received today and seems to be what I was looking for."
3,Nice functionality....doesn't stand up to the heat,I just burned through the second one of these. I stick it to the stainless backsplash up near my hood...as far away from the heat source as possible but wound up with the digital LCD displays failing due to the heat generated by the stove. This may be a problem with all LCD based timers (this is the only one I have used with the stove). However I am a little disappointed and had higher hopes for the device.
3,Not impressed!,"Well I got this delivered to my job today. I'm looking at it right now. First I bought this because of the great reviews that I read here. Also it looked great on my p/c sceen.In person it looks like a piece of cheap chap! It looks like it will break if you change the battery.On my p/c it looks like it has black trim in person it has a grayish trim to it. My kitchen is black and stainless steel. So far not worth what I paid for it.I'll give you all an up-date when I get home and try it out. Hope that it will at the very least preform better then it looks.UPDATE April 1st, 2008;I went home and tried it out. The set up is very easy. The alarm isn't loud enought for me. I like to watch TV and cook at the same time and I require a kitchen timer that is loud enought for me to hear.My rating for this kitchen timer is now 4 stars instead of 3 stars since the set up is easy and it has a very strong magnet on the back."
3,Doesn't work with NiMH rechargeable AAA Battery,"Timer functionality is OK, but it would be nice if you could use NiMH battery,currently the most popular form of rechargeable battery. Probably the NiMH nominal 1.2V voltage is insufficient to power the display--but it could. Manufacturer would do well to support it so that they could claim a 'green' product. Built-in clock function would also be nice, inexpensive, and simple to implement."
3,"Good for losing weight, hard too","I have both videos. The first is good for muscle mass, but you can only do itonce every three days.This one is good for losing weight. Also excellent for cadiovascular health. Getting stronger,I'm not too sure. The excercises are harder and require more weight."
2,Just another bad audience recording,"I thought I was buying a decent Gentle Giant audience recording; the sound is awful. Let's be real if the sound recording is bad you won't enjoy the music.I have a lot of bootlegs and I stay away from this type of audience recordings.This CD is only for Gentle Giant completists that wants to own everything the band has done. Don't bother, personally I love the band but I didn't enjoy the CD. Buy the OFFICIAL LIVE. I want my money back."
1,McAfee's still in Business?,"I have used McAfee products for 4 yrs. w/out major problems. Then came along Virus Scan 6.0 / Firewall 3.0 The latest greatest from Mcafee, right? Not even, McAfee really blew it with the release of these two software packages. Their lack of quality control is unbeleivable. The problems I had installing these ranged from simple typo's in the autoexec.bat command line to registry errors(we know what that can do) to start up folder problems. And their tech support chat room, once you finally get in, is a joke. Needless to say, this software ... I have returned it and am seeking a full refund including cancelling my subscription to their ""Clinic"". If you want to try it out, be my guest, but be warned: be prepared for some major headaches. Also this is the first virus scan I've ever seen that would mysteriously shut itself off. How can I trust a virus scan that does that, among numerous other gliches? Not hardly."
1,Don't Bother!,"A previous review here warned that this book is poor, but heedlessly I read it anyway, to my chagrin. Character developement is fair, but plot and background science are just plain hideous. This novel is full of fancy French words, point is, who cares, and it is so excessive it detracts from the story line. The writing style makes reading a chore through much of the book, very vague at times and jumps back and forth a lot with the reader struggling to figure things out.Explicit sex is graphically portrayed two or three times, and to no point whatsoever. Some writers, notably William Barton, use sex as an integral part of character developement and plot, but Spinrad seems to just stick it in (no pun intended) for just shock appeal, or whatever. No more Spinrad novels for me, for awhile."
2,Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?,"This book started slow, but I took it with a grain of salt. Soon the story drew me in - Future Earth is in the midst of an ecological disaster and is being exploited for political means and commercial gain; Big gangsters and even bigger egos competing for big profits.I was happily reading until about two hundred pages or so in, when it suddenly turned into ridiculous soft-core porn. After that, I wasn't interested enough to find out how it ended."
1,Just a waste of paper...,"...most pages have nothing more than one sentence or brief paragraph...the total written content could have been put into probably 30-40 pages...and then there's things like, ""your knowledge of the situation changes the situation instantly""...uhhhhh...okay...besides being pretty obvious, what am I supposed to do with that?...meditate on it?...""the world is not as it seems and you are not as you think you are.""...uhhh, ditto...the only good thing about it is that it takes no more than fifteen minutes to read -- so at least the annoyance is brief..."
3,Changing the way you think,"I never thought i was philosophical person but reading this book, it really challenge me to view the experiences around me in a different way. The book is broken down into different chapters such as parallel universes, natural selection, cause and effect and concept of time which whilst it is expressed in a scientific manner, the ideas proposed also challenges to the reader to think in a spiritual sense as well. Small book but definately BIG on ideas!"
3,"Good book of quotes, but lacks substance.","I bought this book to help me explore Quantum Physics on a more substantial level. That's not what I got out of the book. It's a bunch of quotes and sayings from Fred about many different thoughts, topics & ideas. If you're already familiar with Fred's other writings and want something to help spur your creativity, deeper thinking or to just meditate on this would fit into that category. However this definitely shouldn't be your first Fred Wolf book. It's not a very helpful introduction to Quantum Physics. But thought provoking in it's own right."
5,GREAT FOR MOMS AND NON-MOMS ALIKE!,"Thorough and very accessible, this book has it all for anyone who thinks they might have the ""next big thing"", or anyone just interested in what it takes to make, market and sell. Very informative, well written and organized. Great pictures, personal stories (this book is not at all ""dry""), helpful hints, forms, schedules, etc. I really appreciate how this book lays it all out for you without ever making it feel overwhelming or too daunting a task. Thank you Tamara!"
5,Outstanding!!,"This book covers so many areas I never even considered. Even though I'm not a mom the book was very informative and provided me with many tips in great detail about how to launch my product.I wish there were more business books like this, light on fluff and heavy on information."
4,"Cool toy, misleading photo","This is a fun toy -- the action figure moves and poses with much more flexibility than a typical action figure. Just be prepared for two things -- the pick (sorry, not the technical climbing name I'm sure) shown in the photo does not come in the kit, but he does come with the other stuff you see - rope, backpack, clamps and stuff to put in the backpack. Rather surprising (and not in a good way) -- one of the items in his kit is a HAND GUN. Really didn't expect that."
4,very compelling,it started off very ordinary and then went into a different twist and rather quickly where the baby was concearned.the film takes a serious of turns and spins. very fast paced and is interesting from start to finish. the film has alot of emotion and meaning. very sad and a struggle between so many elements going on. the kind of movie where you stay on the edge of your seat and wonder what is next. i thought it was very well directed and acted.
4,"yes sir, thats my baby!","the winner of this years oscar for foreign language film, i expected to dislike this as a piece of liberal claptrap. but its not; its a sensitive portrayal of people whose lives have been torn asunder by circumstance (based on the only novel by famed south african playwright athol fugard), and a young thug redeemed (at least to some extent) by accident. a terrific score only serves to further establish a mood of desperation mixed with inklings of hope. a minor masterpiece, and be sure to watch director gavin hoods earlier moving short ""the shopkeeper"", included as an extra on the dvd."
5,Great !!!,I really enjoyed this movie. It was quite intense and full of action. I plan to make it one of my annual reviews!!
2,over rated,A thug becomes instantly humanized when he abducts a baby after shooting the mother. Huh? Beyond belief and certainly not in character for our thug.
1,Wrong format on DVD,"Hi,I bought a DVD, but sadly the norwegian DVD players cannot read the DVD, because of the format. Is it possible to retrun the DVDs, and get it in the right format?"
1,Don't buy this one,I threw this DVD in the garbage. The accent requires sub titles and the four letter word is used through out this movie. Too much violence. Tsotsi was changed in the end but not enough and it isn't worth watching to witness the change.
4,Tsotsi,This story writen by Athol Fugard is wonderful. We see a young gangster in a slum in South Africa who steals a car only to find a baby strapped in a seat at the back. A moving story about how he copes and the effect that this has on his character and actions. Very moving.
5,Tsotsi,"I really enjoyed this movie. I feel that this movie accurately depicted, in a realistic way, a portion of life in Johannesburg, South Africa. The acting, delivered by each person, was wonderful. I feel that one of the reasons why this movie was well made and acted is because, of the fact that most, or all, of the characters are, indeed, from South Africa. It was much easier for them to tell and share this story. This is truly a remarkable movie and story. I feel that Tsotsi should become a, must have, DVD for all movie libraries, collectors and educational institutions throughout the world. As I continue to view this movie, I am able to note different aspects of this story. I am very pleased to have made this purchase."
1,"Foreign language, English typed at bottom","I was very dissapointed in this, as compared to the rave reviewes. I would have enjoyed the movie if I knew the language. I never like to read the words at the bottom."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I think the movie was really cool. sometimes we do not realize that things like these can happen anytime. In my opinion Tsosi did not have the infancy that he wanted. He has good feelings but his anger and his resentment do not let him express those good feelings. Otherwise, he would have abandoned that baby in the car, but he took him and he did not let the baby just die. He rather to murder his friend than the baby's father because he knew that baby needed him and they were good parents not like his drunk father. It was a great movie that shows the social classes and their differences and the unfairness of life sometimes."
4,"GAVIN HOOD, OPUS 3","***1/2 2005. Written and directed by Gavin Hood, TSOTSI is an adaptation of Athol Fugard'sTsotsi: A Novel. Academy award in the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year category in 2006. A young thug from the suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa accidentally kidnaps a baby and takes care of him during a few days. Good portrait of a doomed boy by the South African born director who gave us the unfairly appraisedRenditionlast year."
4,Good Movie,"Thought I'd take a chance. Not a subtitle movie type of guy but I had no problem following along. The movie kept me interested the entire time. I found myself hating the main character but then also hoping he turned himself around. Give it a chance, you might like it."
1,Wrong item pictured,"I don't own a Benchmade Mini Griptillian (though I wish I did). I do however own a CRKT Pazoda. The item pictured is a Pazoda, which is a far, far cry from a Benchmade Mini Griptillian. I just thought I'd take the time to point it out."
4,Great literature,Well written with a compelling story line. The characters continue to develope throughout the story.1 2 3 4 5
3,Outdated but good info,Some information in this book is outdated but still a very informative book. You can get the latest information from Militaryoncesource.com
1,Retro Roaster,We love Jamie Oliver but this roasting pan is pathetic. We are on our second one having the first one crack during normal use. The replacement just cracked too while roasting a chicken at 425 for an hour and a half. I wouldnt recommend this product to anybody.
1,Same as the first poster...cracked in half,We had EXACTLY the same experience as the prior poster- cracked in half on it's second use.
2,Still too buggy...stick to straight text editing,"If it works, it works great. The problem is it doesn't work. With DW2, I experience at least one crash every few hours, and numerous other bugs. With DW3 30 day trial, I experienced fewer crashes but still a new type of bug every few hours. Macromedia never responded to my dozens of bug reports. They release only minimal bug updates for DW (ie, of what must be hundreds of bugs, they list only a couple things as being fixed and a couple more as being outstanding, then make no more updates). Their newsgroup is completely swamped with people reporting bugs and problems in varying degrees of desperation, and a few apologists."
3,Good rent. Bad buy.,A radio personality gets all the women in the movie and certain scenes take only 1-2 minutes. I don't know what else to say.
2,Mishap gone wrong:,"Sorry guys, you know I love you, respect you. I have seen you a thousand times, been there since the beginning, but if this is the new Mishap...I'm not sure I like it. I'm all for change and delving into different musical forrays, but Mishap has always been an acoustic-jam band to me. Now there trying to be more rock oriented...no more mandalin...no more harmonica...just straight up rock, which is fine...but its not Mishap. Guys...stop trying to be something your not. And what's happened to JIm?? Why is Matty the lead singer now?? I can't understand it...Jim's role in the band has diffenetly seemed to fade a bit...not sure why. Anyways...I'm rarely critical of Mishap...but I believe the band needs to stay with its roots...what made the band so great....if this is the future of Mishap....I'm afraid I won't be there. Sorry guys."
1,not as pictured,The sending unit is not as pictured instead of having the aluminum shaft that the pivot point can be adjusted up and down on this is the simple version where the pivot point is at the top of the tank requires a really wide tank. If you have a tall narrow tank this is not compatabile.
3,Good scope for the money,If you are looking for a good scope for the pistol than this may work for you. I found it to be just a tad too big and heavy. I know there are better pistol scopes out there but its a toss up because you have to spend more money but overall its not a loss if you buy one.
4,Good product,The product itself is of good quality yet the instructions to calibrate it are not for beginners especially the fine adjustment. Being a beginner I still have to figure it up.
4,Simple but beautiful tragedy,"This is a german classic representing romance tragedies, though not as in depth nor as complex as the likes of Romeo and Juliet. I do not want to give anything away so briefly... The story revolves around a monk who loves God but cannot separate his natural feelings for a hangmans daughter, who is an outcast because of her fathers occupation. A look into religion at its best and at its worst. A great view of peoples bias without basis. A tale of the destruction of love from innocence. It is a beautifully written story encompassing compassion, jealousy, fanaticism and cruelty. Recommended for readers who enjoy the beauty of classic tragedy. Easy Read"
5,Gorgeous,"Today, my song ""Roof"" won the Best Podcast on Red Room.Red Room wrote:""Jennifer Van Bergen's gorgeous song is about using forgiveness to rediscover what's real.""You can find me (and my songs) on Red Room at: http://www.redroom.com/author/jennifer-van-bergen."
3,I would not hold my breath on the rebate/cashback,"Amazon had a similar ""deal"" about 4 months ago when I placed the orders for Dove products to get cashback and rebates. Four plus months later, I have not seen any shipments/cashback/etc... Oh well, bait-and-switch tactics are alive and well everywhere!"
2,Poor audio qualities,I purchased this phone for a small office to use with its onboard answering machine. It is impossible to get the volume to an understandable volume on our outgoing message.
4,Good book.,"I had a hard time putting this one down. Even when you know everything will work out, you don't know how it will ever work. Good characters!"
4,Saving Lord Verwood,Very entertaining and it was cross referenced with my other romance books i have read. Could not wait to see how it ended.
2,Some Good Highlights But Not Really Worth It,"Bull Busters: The All-Stars of Rodeo has some exciting rodeo moments, but I wouldn't suggest it to big rodeo fans. While some highlights are funny to watch and keep you on the edge of your seat, the bloopers could be better, and the movie leaves out some of my favorite rodeo stars."
3,Big Ed,"I got this for shooting 10 meeters, it dosen't focus that close. It has lots ot perellex and wont hold zero, I have to dial it in every time I take it out. It does shoot good groups after dialing it in. I put in on an air pistol so maybe that has somthing to do with it but I'm not happy with it."
1,gasket over priced,$13.99 for a rubber gasket and 5 screws is ridiculous. Other dealers sell them for $2.99.
4,More People Should See This,"I'm still waiting for this gem to be put on DVD. I doubt if a lot people are familiar with this film, and that's a shame, and perhaps the reason it hasn't been put on disc. I remember being surprised how good it was the first time I saw it. I liked it even better the second time.What's to like? Well, Spencer Tracy, to begin with. It's also interesting to see this true story about a man living in the heart of Africa in a time when few white men had ever gone to that continent. Livinstone (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) also was a good witness for his Christian faith, and even made a strong admirer out of partner and skeptic Stanley, played by Tracy.Completing the fine cast in this film are Nancy Kelly (who looks beautiful), Walter Brennan and Charles Coburn.The film could have been a spectacular visual one if it had been done in Technicolor, since the locations are in Africa, not some Hollywood set....but tough to get everything. I'm not complaining. Great film."
4,Walter Brennan is hilarious as Spencer Tracy's sidekick,"This is a fun movie, and the performance of Walter Brennan as Spencer Tracy's sidekick, provides some really great humor to the story. His timing is impeccable. I watched this movie after reading King Leopold's Ghost, by Adam Hochschild; I highly recommend this book."
1,"Poor design, would never buy again","This product worked fine for the first week or so, and then it would start to slip. It finally broke after not even a year of normal use by 3 adults. Pretty cheap design, not surprising the plastic cap on the end came off. Would go with an all-metal fixture next time."
3,"A good reference, but poor instruction manual.","If you are new to Judo, this book will give you a flavor of the many different techniques you will learn, as well as the history of judo and grade requirements for advancement. Don't look to it as a teaching manual. The techniques are only briefly described and the illustrations are sometimes difficult to follow. It is a good reference, though."
3,Worth a read,"This book was basically enjoyable and original enough to be interesting. The writing was not outstanding, but was not bad enough to reduce my enjoyment of the book. Unfortunately, the story sort of fell apart towards the end. It got difficult to follow and went on too long. After reaching a point that would have made a great ending, Sullivan opted instead to continue the story for another 20-30 pages. The result was an anti-climactic and disappointing end to an otherwise pretty good novel."
2,What Hard Work!,"I love Trish Sullivan's work; I was absolutely enraptured by Lethe. But Dreaming In Smoke had me drowning in math, strange arguements, and a world that would have been better served if the author (luv ya, Trish, really!) would have spent less time on the mechanics of the colonist's existance and more on the mechanics of their emotions. The biggest problem with the book is that I really didn't feel like Azamat Marcsson was much of a threat or why the book spent so much time revolving around his experiments. Not to admit a cheesy past addiction to Nintendo or anything, but dern, I wanted to know more about what life was like for Ganesh during this crisis, it's almost as if the sky was falling, but nobody bothered to spend enough time talking about how and why. And yes, what WERE the fights with the dead? And yes, I would wait and buy it second-hand as well in hindsight."
3,Didn't do it for me,"I never got the hang of disjointed surrealistic novels. This is definately one of those. It seems to meander in various directions, and I never once got the hang of what exactly was going on, or what was supposed to be going on - if anything.It also suffered from a fault that many futuristic novels have. It seems that references to past events stop about the present time, and go back from there. Few novelist bother to fill in enough backstory for references to the past after the novel was published. It's a minor thing, but it can annoy me at times.It had the elements of an interesting story, but I couldn't put it together well enough to enjoy the novel. If this is your sort of novel, you'll like this one well enough. It isn't mine, so I didn't."
3,"Good imagery, non-compelling characters.","Sullivan's volume is full of great descriptions of the world inhabited by Kalypso, she makes you feel like you're really there. However, the characters make you really glad you're not there. I personally couldn't have cared less if Kalypso and the rest of the colonists lived or died. I was more concered about the computer, who, combined with the technology which composed it, was a much more compelling element to the story than the selfish whiny characters who wage pointless battles with each other, which are never detailed, you just hear ""the dead fought the grunts"" but never any mention of HOW the dead fought the grunts, I assume they threw rocks."
2,Dreaming In Smoke,"On a hostile planet filled with fast-evolving bacterial life, a group of would-be colonists are endangered when their ship AI goes on the blink.Though the worldbuilding was full of original detail and the plot featured a lot of action, I found this book nearly impossible to finish. The writing was awkward and full of unnecessary exposition and ""telling"". The characters' behavior seemed nonsensical, unconnected to what was happening around them--often their reactions seemed weirdly casual, and at other times just inappropriate and lacking perceptible motivation. I couldn't relate to them, and because of that it became hard to focus on the convoluted plot.I like the author's Someone to Watch Over Me, but I don't recommend this book."
4,"Quick and Fun Read, a bit of disappointing ending...","This book was great fun. Considering how much the average person knows about the inner workings of the College of Arms, it is great to hypothesize about what goes on. The ending was a bit anticlamatic, but the books was certainly fun."
2,"Beware despite two cells shown in the image, only one cell shipped","Even though the image on the product page shows two coin cells, only one is shipped (what was shipped is an Energizer CR2450). Misleading product information at least."
1,Gene Kushlan is an ASS...................,The worst experience ever. The welds broke and Kushlan Products told me I had to ship it back to their site at my expense and then pay the shipping for the replacement. I threw the piece of crap in the dumpster and went to Lowes and bought one of their like mixers.
3,John Keane,"This disc consists of recordings of Michael Houser which have had other musicians added into the mix after his passing. It basically sounds very similar to all of the John Keane produced Panic releases. Mystical and magical Houser rants aside, I would have been happier if there were a 2nd disc containing the tracks before they were spruced up by John Keane."
5,Mikey at his best,"Perfectly arranged, beautiful songs. You can't help but getting a little teary eyed. We MISS YOU MIKEY!!!!!"
1,My boyfriend wanted it.,"""Corny"" Don Cornell. Very dated. I bought it for my boyfriend who wanted it and even he realized how passe it was."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Yet another of the Legion reboots. There not necessarily being much point to this one. However, Waid's affection and knowledge of the material generally shows, so this is a competent job. Here, the Legion must help to stop some really serious problems on a prison planet. This prison planet houses a bunch of very nasty types, and some seriously powerful enemies."
3,"This is yet another incarnation of ""MENUDO""","According to the gossip around certain circles, the members from the new Puerto Rican group credited as 'TICK TOCK' were originally auditioning for the All-New incarnation of 'MENUDO,' the teen-sensation from the early and mid-80's. They had some minor press coverage and TV appearances promoting them as the NEW 'Menudo,' simply (or just)called something else. They even performed some of the classic MENUDO songs, with a funky-reggaeton sound behind it. Some of the most popular MENUDO members, like JOHNNY LOZADA and RAY REYES have even spoken in behalf of these new talented youngsters, in a passing of the torch sort of speach."
2,Sound disaster,"It could make a difference who you buy this cd from but I don't think so. This should be one of the great Big Bill Broonzy cd's available because the songs are all terrific. Unfortunately the quality of the sound is an abomination. It sounds as if the cd was made by holding a microphone next to the speaker of a victrola playing the original record. I cannot imagine it being any worse. I have bought Charly recordings before and never noticed anything horrendous, but the recording I got from an Amazon seller is unbelievably bad."
1,Kind of glad it's out of print . . .,"Though this review is a bit late, as the book is out of print now, I'll still share my thoughts.This is not a very good dictionary, which disappoints me. I would have thought that the Oxford University would have taken more care in making a dictionary. And I feel sorry for anyone that bought it (including myself).As a beginner in Irish I have a few grievances. First and most important, there are no plural forms. Anyone learning Irish seriously will learn that Irish plural forms are not very predictable, thus they need to be learned with the singular form of nouns. This dictionary only lists the singular form for most nouns!Secondly, and not as serious, it doesn't have any phonetic pronunciation for the individual words. Now the phonetic pronunciation is a mixed blessing anyway, but it does help. I say mixed blessing because the pronunciation represented may not be the pronunciation used it the area. There is no single standard pronunciation for Irish."
2,The Oxford Pocket Irish Dictionary: Bearla-Gaeilge/Gaeilge-,I'm extremely disappointed with the dictionary. The main reason I ordered it was to get phonetic pronunciation with every word. I read a lot of historically based novels about Ireland and would like to know how to say the words in Irish that appear in the books. I returned it immediately (along with the Scottish/Gaelic dictionary that was equally lacking).
3,Gaelic is not for the faint of heart,"A difficult language to learn, and even harder to master. The letters have a different sound to them than any lanquage based on the Latin forms. However, it is helping a great deal in my quest to conquor this old, and very melodic tounge. Now I just need to work on my brogue."
5,Wonderful!,"Who doesn't like the story of A Christmas Carol? This rendition has a twist for the young and old and follows the original story as much as any other retold story, but with animation...fantastic animation!!!"
4,One of my favorite Christmas movies,"Watching this movie each Christmas has become a tradition in our home. Having the DVD now makes it easy to watch when we decide and the 3D or blu-ray is great. The only somewhat negative thing is, the DVDs doesn't let you re-size the picture to fill our 16:9 screen. It's seems to be set in the ""theatrical size"" which won't allow adjustment to full letter-box size on some DVDs. That said, I'm still very HAPPY I bought the movie and can enjoy it all year long at our convenience. Worth the price paid."
1,A Christmas Carol,Terrible! I purchased brand new/wrapped in original wrapping so it would be nice & the cover was broken and ripped but someone wrapped it in plastic wrap. Very deceiving.
2,Not good but not horrible either,Very boring and hard to watch. Don't spend your money on this. Opt for one of the classic Dicken's versions instead.
1,IDisneys 3d blue ray 4 pack the christmas carol,"I have purchased two copies of this dvd and one was from wal-mart.com and today I received a copy from Disney dvd club. Neither one of the 3d discs will work. I have the samsung 3d tv,3d blueray player, so I have the right equipment but cannot get it to play. And off course Disney customer service is only open when everyone else is working. The regular discs work fine. Can any give me some suggestions?"
2,this movie was alright,The animation of this movie didn't suit my style. I photo realistic style doesn't translate well with kids animation. The story was alright as well. You can't go wrong with Jim though.
4,Great for older kids and adults,"I love this story and I think this version is really well-done. I didn't pay close enough attention to the rating and allowed my five year old to watch part of it, which was a mistake. It's really intended for an older audience. Overall, this is a fun version of the classic story."
3,Good but might be to much for the kids,"This movie is a good take on the same old tale we all come to love. I just didn't expect it to be a little on the scary side. Literally some scene in the movie had made me more tense than some of the horror genre itself. I came in thinking this could be a good movie for the kids on a nice cold holiday season, I came out thinking I better not let them watch it just yet. Other than that the movie itself is decent. The 3d animation seem off just like any movie that uses this photo 3d animation style. But it a good movie to own when the price is right, but I wouldn't get my hope up on it since it is Disney. This version does offer a lot though for the price."
1,Typical Hollywood Drivel,"Yet another failed attempt by Hollywood to use beautiful animation and graphics (which the movie does have)in an attempt to overcompensate for a lackluster performance in every other area. Also, it leaves out a few important aspects from the book.This movie is a shell of the Sim or Scott version. I doubt I will watch it even a handful of times through the coming years.If all you care about is animation, this is probably the film for you and your family. If you appreciate cinema for character development, acting, and realism, this is not the movie for you."
1,A revised review from an earlier posting.,"This is a truly disappointing DVD. The writers left out a lot of dialogue for visual effects. They were more interested in created a visual version that is full of action. Much of the action has nothing to do with the storyline.The scenes are dark, hard to watch, and change very rapidly. The characters are cartoonish, poorly created and for CGI creations do not have much humanlike action. If I had previewed this DVD, I would NOT have purchased it. I even waited for the Blue ray version before making my purchase. I am sending this to my grandchildren. I am sure they will enjoy it more than I do. Best advice: Try to watch it before you buy it. If you like it fine. I didn't."
1,"disappointing, at best","My 10 year old son and I sat down to watch this movie . . . we were so disappointed. First, there are scenes in this movie I wish my 10 year old hadn't seen. (Watching the ""Ghost of Christmas Present"" turn to ash and bones isn't a delightful Christmas experience, for example.) Second, Jim Carrey . . . he is typically awesome. Apparently, they didn't let him make the part his own. Scrooge stunk in the movie. Finally, the animation falls FAR short of what one normally expects from Disney. My opinion: save your money . . . I, and my son, absolutely hated this one."
1,Rather poor,"The animation and character design were a mixed bag at best, and seem to be a step back from BEOWULF, Zemekis' last Mo-Cap feature. Backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the figures are very stiff, and many are oddly proportioned, existing in a weird gray area between realistic and cartoon anatomy.Note to the ""too scary for kids"" crowd - IT'S A GHOST STORY - read the source. The movie got that mostly right.As someone who is a great fan of Dickens' story and was really looking forward to this adaptation, it was a huge disappointment."
1,Very disappointing,"I had a hard time sitting through this entire film. Maybe it is because I can almost recite the whole Christmas Carol movie by heart from all the different versions I have seen. But, this has to be one of the worst versions I have ever seen. I was so disappointed in it. I thought it would be funny, but I just found it stupid."
2,Can You Hear Me Now,"I was very disappointed with the volume recording on this movie. I purchased this through the Instant Video portion of Amazon. I have ordered a few other items using this feature, and have been throughly impressed. However, this time, the volume was recorded so low that my students could hardly hear the movie, even through the surround speakers. We read the play, and I was so excited to show this to my students. For ten dollars, I felt very cheated. The movie, itself, is great. Jim Carrey always adds extra flavor to whatever he is in!"
2,Creepy and weird,"This makes ""A Christmas Carol"" at once more frightening and serious than any other rendering and also at times unnecessarily comical. Easily the worst version of this story I have ever experienced."
5,Very Good Film,I like the way this film depicts the meaning of Christmas ans is not afraid to leave the spirit of Christianity in the movie rather than leave it out as many of today's movies do. Jim Carrey does an excellent performance and I would recommend this film for all families to consider during not only the holidays but as a way to live throughout the entire year.
3,Jim Carrey Version,"Jim Carrey stars as Scrooge in this Disney retelling of the classic Charles Dickens story. He meets the ghosts of Christmas past, present and to come. The story itself is a classic and this version does it justice."
3,Nice Christmas video,"I would have liked more things coming out of the screen at me, But,it was very deliteful to watch. We are in the process of viewing more 3D videos to compare to."
4,"Good show, but kind of scary....","This was a good production of an old classic, but I wouldn't show it to young kids as it was rather scary."
5,Great animation!,It's very beautiful to watch. The story has added emotion too which is refreshing. It's also funny at parts due to Jim Carrey.
2,I watched this and enjoyed most of it,"ok i watched this at my grandmothers house, i enjoyed the movie (it was well done not uber sugar coated and not rediculous) until it got to the final spirit. then there is that ridiculous chase seen and just seems shoved in there and is obviously designed as a cheap thrill. It had no point. So in disgust i stopped watching it there."
1,Not For Children!,"I went back and forth about if I should get this movie. I absolutely love the animation on the Polar Express so I finally decided to get this. I was so excited to see this with my kids. Well let me tell you, this is not for children. My nine year old was even hiding his eyes at times. I gave this movie about 15 minutes before finally turning it off. What a disappointment. I wanted a good family Christmas movie to see with my kids and this was not it. I thought being a Disney movie it would not be so scary. Boy was I wrong!"
3,Not as nice as I thought,"I bought this movie for my 2 boys for Xmas thinking it was going to be nice for them to watch a Xmas movie but I was very dissappointed with this movie. The special effects are wonderful as in most movies but my children did not like this movie at all. They are 7 and 8 years old and they felt it was very scary and could not understand well the movie.I had to explain to them the movie since the movie is about Scrooge's past life. They couldn't get it why he was old first and then he was a little boy and what was going on. The ghost part was the part they did not like at all but I guess that depends on each child. Some children probably wouldn't get scared with ghosts but mine did.If your child is ok about ghosts, I do recommend it but I think it is a little difficult for children to understand. There is not much adventure in the movie. My children liked much more ""The Polar Express"" than this one."
1,"really, really creepy","I found this movie to be really creepy, not at all for small kids. If I were a dis I would have been scared to pieces and had nightmares. The spirits were weird and not at all like Dickens wrote. The animation is interesting, but off putting, and although I have never been a Jim Carey fan, this is not his best or worst effort. All in all the movie is creepy, that is the best word I can use to describe it, it made me uncomfortable. A Christmas Carol is supposed to be about lessons leered from our mistakes, not something that sends you running away from it as fast as you can. All of the retellings of this story in all of it's versions this is the by far the worst."
5,Love movies that are close to the book...,"I took my daughter to see this movie in the theater last year. I was so pleasently surprised that Disney actually stuck to the original story with this film. It held all the humor AND the darkness of the book. Be aware that as this does follow the book, it may not be appropriate for small children. Dickens can be very dark, and scary for young ones."
3,Good feeling gone...,"Overall, I felt that Disney took their usual liberties with a storyline, and turned this into a darker, more depressing film with random bits of unnecessary action. Instead of feeling the holiday spirit, I just felt scared and depressed.On the plus side, the animation was cool and the cast solid."
2,Creepy,Not sure I would have my children watch this. Seems it was creepier than the original. I am sure people really enjoyed the animation but I just didn't enjoy it.
4,Christmas tradition,My family and I have always had a tradition of watching the original Christmas Carol on Christmas eve. When this version came along our daughter became hooked. We now watch both versions throughout the season.
3,It was okay,"There is just so many versions of this story, I was just not very impressed with this one at all."
2,Disney's a Christmas Carol,I didnt really care for the animation syle in this movie. I feel like I just spent the last two hours on a cartoon camera flying through the air.Jim Careys voice acting was sub par as well.
4,This is becoming a Christmas tradition,"A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories but when you add incredible computer animation, it's even better. Some scenes may be too intense for small children but the message is good. Sadly, some of the effects do not transfer to tv as well as it was on the big screen but it won't notice it's missing if you didn't see at the theater.I find it easy sometimes to get lost in the animation and forget the story which is why I give it 4 stars because even though it is amazing, it should not cause you to miss the story...but who can't help but stare mindlessly at the grotesque face of Scrooge or the chest hair of the ghost of Christmas present. Maybe it's just me. Luckily, the shot moves and you snap out of it soon enough"
4,"Wonderful, but intense!","Some parts a little intense for children, so parents use good judgment, but this was a great interpretretation of Dickens' classic!"
5,Excellent,"A virtual Christmas experience.I have always loved this story and there have been many great adaptions made through the years.Disney created a version that I could only have dreamed of when I was a kid.Now, with modern technology, that dream is a reality."
2,The Sound Quality Was Terrible!,"The movie theatrics was good, but was ruined by inaudible dialog and unbalance sound levels. It was maddening - I would raise the volume in order to hear the characters, and then an enormous boom would nearly blow my eardrum out. Or, simply background noise would drown out the dialog, and there was nothing I could do at that point. Disappointing.(The movie was watched using Amazon streaming - perhaps they don't have the bugs worked out yet.)"
1,Won't play!,The DVD I received will not play. I needed it for a school project and was stuck with nothing. I even had my IT person at work look at it and it will not play through a DVD player. There is 10 dollars lost!
5,One word to describe it.... AWESOME!!!!,"I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone. If you have not seen this version of A Christmas Carol, purchase it now! The visual imagery is spectacular! Be forewarned, I personally do not think this version is appropriate for children as it is very heavy, dark and a bit scary. Overall, I think it captures the spirit of Dickens' original work, leaving nothing out. Some may say Robert Zemeckis took too much artistic liberty with Dickens work but I staunchly disagree. The ghosts held up the mirror squarely to Scrooge's face and he had to accept his failures and the very possible consequences of continuing down the path he was currently on. the bestpart of it all though is the fact that much of Dickens' original dialogue from the books are spoken through out the movie. Kudos Jim Cary and Mr. Zemeckis!"
4,Better than average,"I would rate the recreation of this classic movie plot as better than average. The color and actions are good. My complain is that the 3D effect could be better. Although some some scenery render excellent 3D effect, most scenery have limited 3D depth."
4,just a little to dark for kids,I like this movie and it is a dark story but the way christmas present dies is a little heavy but its a good treatment of the story
3,You have go to be kidding me...,"I thoroughly enjoy ""A Christmas Carol"" by Dickens and have read it a number of times. Like all movies, this one took some creative license in its making. Despite what others have said, there are a number of segments from the Dicken's story left out. There is also a relatively long ""chase"" scene involving the ghost of Christmas future that I found...boring...and misplaced. Really? Scrooge shrinking to the size of a mouse? Other than that, the movie is in the GOOD category... not GREAT... good... not as good as TBS's ""A Christmas Carol"" with Patrick Stewart; and certainly not as great as the 1951 version with Alistair Sim... It is animated, and there are advantages with that as far as special effects go, otherwise, it's a keeper and worth watching again."
1,Dickens is spinning...,"Poor Charles must be spinning in his grave. With all due respect to the other reviewers who thought this was faithful to the original story, what Christmas Carol did you read?! I don't recall Ebenezer surfing a rooftop on an icicle or rocketing into the stratosphere after snuffing out Christmas past in the Dickens classic.This is a prime example of a movie made solely to showcase 3D. Zemeckis has proven with Polar Express that he can make a great movie where the special effects are embellishments to a good story line. Not here. Lest you forget, nearly every scene is designed around showing off just how cool 3D can be, whether it's Marley spitting or an insect sized Scrooge rocketing down a drain pipe (I'm sorry, what page is that on in the book?)If you want a 3D thrill-ride, where Tiny Tim takes a backseat to the special effects, you'll love this. If you want a heart warming version of a classic tale - Alistair Sims version remains the gold standard."
1,Highway Robbery offering only theater version 3D,"I think it is a crime to offer this BluRay disk only in the Theater version 3D. I realize the regular BluRay 3D like that used in Polar Express is kind of crummy, at least we are able to watch it in 3D. To watch ""A Christmas Carol"" in 3D you have to buy a new 3D BluRay machine plus a new screen. That is unbelievable in these hard economic times to expect people to go out and buy new expensive hardware for the few movies that will be available in the theater version 3D. Then I don't like the fact the shuttered 3D glasses have to be hooked up by wires to the 3D player. If the also offered a regular 3D version in the set then I would go a head and buy it hoping that in the future I might come into some money to watch the theater version 3D. However, that will never happen. I am stuck with my current equipment until they die or I die which ever comes first. I am very upset with the producers of this set!"
2,kids don't understand it!,I brought 4 10-year olds to see this in the theater. None of them understod it and I didn't like it. It just was not a god movie.
3,disney christmas carol,Bought new they sent used and refused to send the new ones I had bought. GOT NO SATISFATION WHEN I TALKED TO THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON.
2,Gift,Haven't watched it. A gift for my wife.Arrived quickly. Too new a DVD to buy used so had to pay too much for it.
3,DISAPPOINTED,I WAS EXPECTING ALOT MORE FROM THIS MOVIE AFTER SEEING THE ADS AND KNOWING JIM CARREY WAS PART OF IT AND WITH THE ANIMATION. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MOVIE.I HAVE SEEN OTHERS THAT WERE MUCH BETTER. IF I HAD SEEN IT PRIOR TO BUYING IT I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY MONEY.
1,Watch the Muppet's Christmas Carol instead....,"I was excited to watch this on DVD and was thinking about buying it. Glad I waited to watch it first. Honestly, they made Scrooge so grotesque, I had trouble even wanting to look at his face. Not a good way to start off a movie. And it was very morbid, very vivid and went over the top on anything that could be the least bit scary. This is a horror movie. It's great if you like that kind of thing, but I much prefer to have a little bit of Christmas cheer mixed into A Christmas Carol. Yes, the storyline does have ghosts and scary parts in all versions, but this would definitely terrify children. After about 25 minutes in, my husband begged me to please turn it off and we put on one of my favorites, The Muppet's Christmas Carol which is just brilliant, heart warming, funny, pleasant to watch and has great music as well. I recommend that one over this any day. I can't imagine even wanting to see the entire thing."
1,Horrible waste of time,"I don't do many reviews but this movie was so bad that I had to. So many unnecessary and stupid variations from the original story. Dark would be OK but most of the dark parts were just plain stupid. Marley's mouth dropping open, Scrooge chased by red eyed horses, sliding on a chunk of ice and shrunk to miniature size? What? Just awful. This was a chance for Disney and the director to use the technology to enhance the story but it misses on so many levels."
2,Did not enjoy this much at all,"Like other reviewers of this movie I was expecting something special from Disney with an old classic. While the animation graphics are very detailed and impressive, the movie is not interesting or entertaining. I have other previous representations of A Christmas Carol that I have enjoyed watching over and over. I can see no reason to put myself through another viewing of this one. Also, I strongly recommend not showing this to younger children (older children will be totally disinterested). I feel it very inappropriate for young children which is surprising considering it is a Disney product."
1,Disney's A Christmas Carol,This is the worst version I have ever seen!!! The fist two ghosts were silly and totally out of character. And what did the sequence where Scrooge is shrunk add to the story at all? Please don't waste your money or your time.
3,Worth a rent.,"Well, I have to agree somewhat with the disappointed reviewer and with the viewer that apparently absolutely loved it. I definitely wouldn't call it a Holiday favorite, but it does have it's moments. As I sat in the theatre the noise of clanking chains was quite deafening. The animation was done well, but the story just didn't quite flow for me. Maybe I'm just too used to previous remakes to allow myself to truly enjoy this. The obvious usual suspects were included in this remake, ie, ghosts, Scrooge, Tiny Tim (briefly), friends of his through the past.......but I felt something was missing. I really can't put my finger on it. I would suggest you rent it just because it is a classic, but wait until close to Christmas. That way it will help you feel the magic of the season and the movie a little better!"
1,Suprising,"I saw this movie in the theaters on Christmas day when it first came out. I love the story of the Christmas Carol and sometimes when it's redone, it can be really good. This was not one of those times. The movie was not quippy, cute or funny, and I would have expected that, being that it was made by Disney. I realize that certain part of this story are meant to be scary, but some parts were overdone. Overall, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over and I was a bit sad that we picked that one to watch on Christmas."
4,Christmas (Animation) Carol Jim Carey,This is a high quality featuire film animation witten with the old stle production values. A must for any Blu-ray collection.
4,Not recommended for small Children!!,"I bought this movie thinking it would be like all the other Christmas Carol movies. It is a great movie for adults and ""mature"" adolescents, but definately not for toddlers or children under the age of 5. My daughter who loves Scooby Doo movies where there are monsters all the time, was scared to the point of shaking in my arms and we had to turn it off. So FYI: not the Christmas Carol you intended to purchase."
3,A Christmas Carol,"My kids barely understood what was being said which is sad because I think they miss the moral of the story, The second ghost was a little too much I watching his life thru the floor REALLY! I believe my daughter smacked her lips a few times before she got up and left, I must say the last ghost was a treat we were intrigued at that point we were like whats going to happen next and all the scenes before this was WASTE OF MY FAMILY TIME!! So in closing from the beginning of the last ghost to the credits was worth watching!!"
2,Disney's A Christmas Carol w/Jim Carey,"I am not a fan of Jim Carey, but I love the story, A Christmas Carol. My family also likes the Pixel movies, however, this movie is a real disappointment. Parts of it are o.k. but some parts are dark and eerie. I know the ghosts are supposed to put fear in Ebeneezer's heart, but this was somewhat overkill. Jim Carey is still recognizable in spite of his portrayal of Scrooge, but I could overlook that had the movie been any good. Love Disney, but this one fell a little short, in my opinion."
4,"Nice revision, wouldn't have known it was Jim Carrey","Overall, the revision is pretty good but is slow in certain areas (probably much like the original). You would't know it was Jim Carrey because it doesn't sound like him."
3,Okay,"I was reviewing this as a teacher to show 3-5 grade students. Special effects were great, but I thought the dialogue was a times a little hard for them to follow."
5,The family loved it!!,"Great movie! Jim Carey did an excellent job. The ghost of Christmas past was so funny, parents and kids both laughed!!"
5,Amazing,"This is an amazing film. Great job by Jim Carrey in so many roles, I didn't even realize it until the credits! Animation and reality at its best. I don't think this is a film for small children as realistic as the ghosts were portrayed probably would be a little frightening for them. I've seen this in 3D and was amazed how well the HD version matched the scenes - could picture it in 3D. I would recommend this film to all adults!"
5,review for disney's a christmas carol,i have always loved a christmas carol because charles dickens is one of my favorte authors and i would reccomend this movie to anyone who love's charles dickens
4,My kids liked it a lot,"There were some scary parts, but my daughters (6 and 9 years old) both liked the movie and understood the plot."
2,3D is gorgeous,"The 3D presentation is very nice. However, the story doesn't involve you. Surprising, because this is a time-worn tale, it should be a no-brainer to tell it properly, you would think. Just goes to show that making magic is not as easy as it looks.Get it on a clearance sale only."
3,"Good movie, but NOT for little kids!","I will make this short and sweet:1. The animation was wonderful - very cool to watch.2. It was WAY too scary for a PG rated movie. I have 3 kids ranging from 9 to 3 years old and they were all terrified & covering their eyes AND ears. As soon as they uncovered them, another scary scene came along. It was one scary scene after another. They were too scared to watch most of the movie.3. The characters use 1800s english, with accents, which was very difficult for my kids to understand. They kept asking me what they were talking about.4. Overall, I think it was a pretty good movie, but it just wasn't made for little kids. I think it's appropriate for kids ages 10 & up. I'm giving it three stars because I feel that it was marketed to little kids, and was not appropriate. I would not have rented it had I known how scary it was."
3,all those poor little kids,"Had I given this a single one-star rating, nobody would read my review thinking that I'm just a Disney-hater...but there's more to it than that. True, the scene animation and voice characterizations are stellar. But make no mistake, this is a HORROR MOVIE packaged as a PG children's movie. Disney doesn't care one bit about all those children aged 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? etc who were dragged into the theater by their unwitting parent and exposed to some of the most horrific and startling images imaginable. Why is Hollywood so hell-bent on hastening our children's transition from innocence to trauma-survivor??!!! I can say that with some credibility as I am a therapist with trauma survivors...and there is such a thing as cumulative trauma. This movie should have been rated at least PG-13, but Disney accomplished what they set out to do in creating a stunningly haunting adaptation."
4,Pretty good take on this tale that we all know ...,There's so many movies about scrooge that were made...and its basically the samestory over and over again...some with better actors/actresses than others. Thistake on Christmas Carol is again the same story /movie that were used to..but witha little twist...its computer animated and the movie has just enough ingredientsto keep it interesting. Jim Carrey does a good Scrooge and the reward comes inthe end where he captures the spirit of Alester Sim...the best scrooge player thereever was.The movie and music is a little darker than previous versions...but at least itmakes it diffirent enough to be enjoyed again.
5,EXCELENT!!!!!!!!!,"The best version from this famous history!!!!!! Jim carry one author wich I mever liked for his boring and ""forced to be funny"" papers, surprised myself with his interpretation, and I am obligate to say that he was more than perfect to represents the old Scrooge!!!!!! For who loves this kind of history worth to get it to watch and watch again!!!!!"
2,"Love Jim Carey, but not in this one.","I think Jim Carrey is soooo talented, but this movie doesn't capture his great acting skills. It is very dark and since we watched both this version of A Christmas Carole and the musical version with Kelsey Grammer, there is no comparison. This version is not fun. Our-5-year old son didn't care for it, although my husband liked it more than I did."
5,"I know, I know, Jim Carrey as the Scrooge?","You most certainly will not be disappointed in Jim Carrey's performance at all. I was expecting an over the top performance, aka ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Truthfully, if you did not know he was the lead in this movie, you would not even recognize that he is the iconic fabled Ebineezer Scrooge. I honestly believe that this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" will soon become a Christmas classic. The 3d format takes this movie to a far superior home viewing experience."
2,Nice picture quality,"Nice picture quality but really sloooooow plot development, even for anyone who has read the book or seen at least 20-30 versions of the same film."
4,For class,"My students loved it, it had a great message. The only problem was that some of the scenes were too dark and hard to see."
4,Arrived in Time For Christmas,Ordered this right before Christmas and didn't think it would arrive in time for Christmas but to my surprise it did and made a great stoking stuffer.
5,Wonderful,Because this is computer generated graphic there is a lot move of following closer to the book. It has a few scary parts so I would not recommended it for small children. I enjoyed the movie very much.
3,"Not Bad, But","I enjoyed most of this movie. On DVD I can skip the parts I don't enjoy. The animation is spectacular - and what can I say about Jim Carey who voices most of the parts. The problem, as I see it, are a few overly extended sequences that don't really help the story along. It's a good rendition, it just isn't the best. As I see it."
4,Disney's a Christmas carol,"I thought it was very entertaining. However, I expected it to be a musical. I loved the animation. I was a little disappointed as I expected it to be more like the original storyline.My favorite version is Scrooge, the musical."
3,the movie was ok,"Saw this movie in 3d in the theaters last year. The animation was ok, not really to my taste. Also the 3D effects weren't the best I've seen. Other than that i enjoyed the movie"
3,Mtnbiker,I'm just writing this in reference to the 3-d claim of this movie. Just beware that it appears to me that blu-ray 3d is not the same as 3d blu-ray. The two titles i have that utilize the active shutter technology are known as blu-ray 3d. And the other titles i'm seeing that are stating 3d blu-ray seem to use those crumby two color glasses. Buyer beware. Man I hope they create a separate blu-ray 3d classification. This could really create some confusion.
2,Over The Top Scares,"I've loved some versions of A Christmas Carol, but for me this one is too loud and in your face for kids under 10 or so. If you didn't see it in the theater thinking you'd save money and buy it for this holiday season, I have to say I don't recommend it. If you want a fun family version of this, I recommend going instead with Mickey's Christmas Carol or The Muppet Christmas Carol!I saw this in the theater with my kids and spent the whole movie helping my son cover his ears in anticipation of the next loud surprise. When the ghost of Christmas present screams and writhes while he rapidly ages and turns to dust was a low point; it required some convincing that staying for the end would be worth our while."
1,A big let down,"Let me start off by saying I love Christmas movies, almost all of them. So I went to the theatre with high hopes but was quickly let down. Being Disney and having Jim Carey I was expecting an updated story with some comical twists and some laughs, but there were none. To be honest, it was boring. The 3-D was alright, but overall the movie was a big miss.I'll stick with the Muppet's and Mickey's versions of A Christmas Carol."
4,One of the Best Versions of a Christmas Carol!,"Jim Carrey voices Scrooge in Robert Zemeckis' version of a Christmas Carol. You know the story, he's mean and self-centered and on Christmas eve he's visited by 3 ghosts. But this version is still very worth seeing due to the great animation and the fine work by Jim Carrey.I expected Jim Carrey to be extremely annoying voicing Scrooge, as well as playing the 3 spirits. He's pretty restrained though and that's good since he gives his best performances when he's not over-acting. Zemeckis is good at making this kind of movie but he's too good to just make animated movies. I'm hoping that his next is a live action film. I mean, this is the guy that made Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and Forrest Gump. Still, he deserves one of his animated movies to be nominated for best animated film and this one deserves it the most."
5,Great interpretation...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this interpretation of Charles Dickens story. It presented the story with the same ""feeling"" as the original story. Some films try to gloss-over the seriousness of this tale...and the lesson it tries to convey. We'll enjoy this for many holidays to come."
5,Great 3D Movie,"This is by far the best 3D home movie I have to date. Of course, I only have three but that's from lack of availability, but I digress.The animation in this movie is better than the Monsters vs Aliens or Despicable Me movies. The people look almost life like. The 3D effects bring you into the movie. As for the story, I've always been a fan and this movie does it justice. As far as a not kid friendly movie, well, it is rated PG for a reason. I won't let my 5 year old watch it for a few years.I definitely recommend this movie and it's a great movie to show off to your friends."
3,"Beautiful, but not for kids","I can really appreciate this film for its beauty - take any single frame and freeze it and it looks like an exquisite oil painting. I also can appreciate that it stays very close to the original telling of the story.That being said, I sat down to watch it with my 3 young children (ages 4,5, and 8) - and while they're not traumatized - had I reviewed it beforehand I wouldn't have had them watch this one. I should have been more diligent, but I guess I was thinking ""Disney"" and trusted it.Anyway - I enjoyed it, but for any other parents of small children you might want to watch it after they're in bed."
5,A Christmas Carol 2009,"This film is not a mere movie, but an experience. Everything about A Christmas Carol, the performances, computer imagery, music, interpretation of Dicken's story is astounding. I have seen and own all the associated films, with the exception of the 1908 version; but Zemckis' film is by far the best, because it remains true to Charles Dicken's original story. Not only is this a true companion to Dicken's story, but it also allows the viewer to see and understand the world in which the author lived and wrote. It is not just Christmas entertainment, but an experience beyond our own."
2,A Poor Rendition,"I have watched and collected ""The Christmas Carol"" with Albert Finney, George C. Scott and Patrick Stewart. This version is awful. The dialogue is hard to follow, and it leaves out much of the IMPORTANT dialogue that have made the previous versions as good as they are. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this version. The CGI is great but whoever wrote the screenplay left too much out, and relied on the viewers knowledge from other versions. Do not buy this."
5,Great Movie,I enjoyed this movie from begining to end. Usually I fall assleep while watching an animated movie. I was awake for the entire move.
2,"great animation, but I fell asleep.","while the animation was superb, I still fell asleep- which rarely ever happens in movies.i guess part of it was TOO over-the-top... perhaps TOO 3D heavy-handed...the story isn't new- through, it is signature...I'm sticking with the Muppets Christmas Carol..."
2,Was excited to see this movie but.......,"The animation is great...however for younger children this movie is hard to understand. Some parts of the story were quite scary and I don't know why they had to go so far as to have the ghost of Jacob Marley's jaw break apart and what's with the ghost of Christmas present and those scary looking horses? I was hoping for a Christmas movie that we would want to watch over and over again, unfortunately we watched it once and now it's collecting dust. Again this is totally my opinion, someone else might love this movie. My 3 (out of 5) children watched it, their ages are 10, 5 and 4. My ten year old son had a lot of questions, things didn't make sense like the scene with the 2 nasty looking children that hang around the feet of one of the ghosts. So just be prepared, I was even scratching my head thinking, ""what.."" Hope this review helps you, have a Merry Christmas."
2,Format BS!,"Are they deliberately trying to kill 3D? To get a 3D Blu-Ray format of this movie you have to pay for a Blu-Ray format, a Blu-Ray 3D format, and an E-Copy. It is no wonder it costs $31.49. And it seems to be that way across the board on most of the 3D movies worth watching. Just give us the option to purchase what we want, a copy of the movies in Blu-Ray 3D format. Now that the technology is up and running it doesn't cost any more to produce it in 3D than in 2D. Enough of the BS!The 2 Stars rating was because of all the BS. The movie was excellant and on its own would have been given 4 Stars. The sound affects especially were great. The ticking sound made by the sleet impacting the roof tops was right on."
2,Poor stream,I loved the movie. I may even purchase it for next Christmas. It did not stream well though and eventually cut off all together towards the end. Very disappointing.
5,great movie,My 2 granddaughters could watch this move over & over again. They even request to see it when they visit & they also have a copy at their home too. Good flick!
4,LIKE THE MOVIE BUT...,"I really like the movie, BUT I can't understand why the company doesn't mantain the digital copy longer. I just bought it and can't redeem it."
1,"Movie OK for me, but 2 discs wouldn't play in my DVD player","Unlike others I had seen the reviews before seeing the movie and knew it wasn't oriented toward small kids. I also saw it in the theater (in 3D) so I knew what to expect of the DVD in terms of story and the telling. I also have several versions of A Christmas Carol and don't need then all to be the same with only the actors being different. I enjoy the retelling from the classic to the Magoo to this version.So the reason for the 1 star is for the DVD itself. I have no problems playing DVDs on my Denon DVD-2200, but the first disc I bought would stall and freeze, showing pixels. I returned it and got a replacement. That one was even worse. I've played numerous older and newer DVDs on my player before and after trying to play this DVD. They all played fine this one would not."
2,DIDNT LIKE IT..BUT REALLY WANTED TO!!!,"Hey everyone, well I really wanted to like this movie... however it was just to weird... funny at very very few parts.... Sorry Disney my family gives this movie.. 2 out of 5 stars!!! This Christmas Carol Movie went very wrong!!!!ThanksIts your Review from the Jay Guy"
1,Save you money!,"Horrible attempt at the classic. I thought this would be good for all the actors in it and it was VERY disappointing. Couldn't even finish it, it was so bad. Half the time you can't understand what Jim Carey's character is even saying."
1,Disappointed,I wish I would have rented this before buying it because I would not have wasted my money. Truly disappointed in Disney and Jim Carrey needs to stick to comedy.
2,PATRICKS MOIVES,VARY LITTLE HUMMER NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. THE ART WAS VARY GOOD DID NOT SEE IT IN 3D MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP MOIVE.
2,Zemeckis Makes Another One.,"Motion Capture gets slightly better with every film that Zemeckis makes, but why in California's holy name does he keep making them? With Polar Express and this one, they are both stories which strain under his efforts to make them feature length through pointless lengthy action, over-dramatic pauses, and obvious hamming on the CG process.If you don't know what I'm talking about, then observe as you and your friends look at each other saying, ""why doesn't he just get on with it?"", and sigh loudly as moments are stretched intolerably. There's a ""roller-coaster"" sequence near the end that made me almost walk out on it. On the upside, the performance capture of Scrooge is pretty good, and each frame looks like a painting. So: hats off, Modelers, Lighting Directors, and Rigging Directors! Get out and support those guys, and look for the amazing, magical Geordie Martinez in the rigging and animation credits, and shout ""HUZZAH!"""
1,Too Scary For Kids,"I bought this movie when it first came out The Beginning was Really good Until Jacob Marleys Ghost showed up with his Broken Jaw I was creeped out and I'm an adult The Other Part that was extremely Creepy was the Ghost of Christmas present after he showed scrooge the present he was on the ground laughing and started to decompose into a skeleton laughing what The Heck was Disney thinking? This movie is not appropriate for family viewing at all. I thought the Ghost of Christmas Future In The Albert Finney one was creepy, This ones more on the line of a Horror movie than a Christmas one."
3,NOT for young children,It's what you would expect from Disney these days. It's a little too graphic for young children and they may not catch what is actually going on. I viewed this with my children and they could not sleep at night. Really removes the joy of Christmas. NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!!!!
3,Great 3D Family Movie...for 13yr olds and over.,"I thought this movie had a few great 3D moments which made great viewing. Exactly the reason why I bought a 3D TV for Home. But, the movie itself I thought was not suited for the PG rating it's given. My 6 & 7year old boys can watch Iron Man 1 & 2 and understand the plot / storyline. With this movie they were forever asking ""Whats going on Dad..."". Great graphics, good storyline, but dialogue not designed for children under 13. Extra star given for the 3D effects."
2,good but creepy looking,impressive special effects but i find the characters' look creepy---their eyes are weird and glass like--it has many nice things about it but i couldnt get over the look of the people. And why is Cratchit so short? some of the girls tower over him. My favorite is still George C Scott with the fabulous Edward Woodward.
2,"Not my favorite version, a bit boring. Good special effects.","Some parts of this version are a bit too long and boring, it took forever to ""get there"",and for some reason it felt like something was missing, just can pinpoint at what it was.I guess it's ok if you got it at redbox or were able to watch it for free. :O)"
1,Horrid,Terrible Terrible ...Although I did read reviews that were good and bad I decided to go ahead and make my own judgement.Bad choice on my part should have went with the bad .I dont have small children but can see where parents would be upset that do .Great animation cannot dispute that ..Annoying and bothersome are two words that best some it up for me .Walt Disney would surely be disappointed !!
3,A pretty good version of the story,"This is a pretty good version of the Christmas Carol. It sticks pretty close to the original story, and does a few interesting things with it. But there are a few odd and boring moments in there as well.Also, a big negative was that the sound isn't adjusted right, and I could barely hear the movie, even with my computer's speakers all the way up. So don't rent it on a computer unless you have external speakers you can plug in."
5,Great Movie,The movie is pretty true to the book and the annimation is fantastic! I highly recommend you give it a look this holiday season.
3,Decent for older ones,thought it was A Liltle bit scary for the young ones and Probably would not see again but worth it watching once.
3,Kinda strange,Their interpretation is kinda strange to us. The Ghost of Christmas past looks weird. Overall Jim Carrey does a good job.
5,"A bit scary for little kids, but sad and touching","My daughter saw the play of The Christmas Carol and she loved every version she watched. ALL THOSE REVIEWS THAT SAY THAT THIS MOVIE IS WEIRD, IT AIN'T WEIRD!!! God Bless us!!"
4,GOD BLESS US EVERYONE,"Our family of 6 went to watch this at the IMAX and it was awesome! The effects are so great with 3-D, totally mystifying. The story as we all know is the typical Scrooge story, it may be a little scary for the younger kids (under 6 I'd say). But overall a delightful show that keeps your full attention. Jim Carrey is great and of course his eyes are identical to Scrooge! Colin Firth in animated form is a remarkable twin to his real self. I don't think I need to give you the play by play like some reviews, I'm just saying that we enjoyed it. Go see it, for the 3-D effects if nothing else, it's well worth it."
4,"Fixed my loose steering problem, but sorta high maintenance","This item fixed my loose steering on my 1987 chevy silverado. Only problem is, with these greasable parts, you're supposed to grease them with every oil change. I think I do enough vehicle maintenance without all that. I prefer the factory OEM sealed units. Sure they eventually wear out, but they come on all cars/light trucks from the factory so you know they're going to last about 100,000 miles. All with zero maintenance. Well worth it if you ask me. Only reason I bought a greasable one is that I didn't have easy access to the factory replacements."
4,Perfect For Living In A Dorm,"Great purchase. I bought this a while back when I went to college and lived on campus. The beds they had at school were your typical hard dorm style mattress and were a pain to sleep on. This foam mattress topper worked wonders, alleviating back pain and helping me sleep a little better at night. My friends and roommates were impressed at how comfortable it made the bed become. Now, this memory foam isn't the most quality stuff, but at the price it's well worth it. I would suggest not getting anything thinner than the 3"" foam, since it's more supportive than the thinner toppers and because it's not a high quality memory foam, thickness makes a difference. I had a thinner foam topper before this and it helped, but nowhere near as much as this did. This is a great purchase, whether you're going off to college or even if you happen to own a twin xl bed at home."
2,"Looks good online, not so much in person","I was a bit surprised when I received this item, it didn't look nearly as good as it did online. It also had a funky plasticy paint smell that I was not comfortable with, so I did not give it to my toddler. Also, I thought this doll looked more Hispanic in person than Native American, mainly the way the clothing was made and the type of dress the doll had. I was a bit disappointed with that only because I am Native American and that's the main reason I bought this item for my daughter, to facilitate our heritage. I would not have bought this item had I known it was going to smell funny."
4,nice covers,enjoy this for what it is...great musicians doing someone elses tunes....it does suck that they never hooked up..
2,Great line-up...,"but why is Schenker doing covers every other album. These guys really didn't jam together either. Davey Pattison has a great voice (check out some Gamma & later Trower records) & you can't go wrong with Dunsbar on the skins, but why not put out some original material? I'm sure Bogert and Pattison must have had a few dozen songs, half-songs, partial songs lying around somewhere that they could have brought to life. Putting out 1 cover record was one thing, but doing a 2nd was just laziness on Schenker's (and the others) part."
3,Good but not as good as D'Addario,"These strings are good, but the .056 is a little too flimsy for the low B string, you're gonna want something a little more heavier. I recommend the D'Addario regular light strings with .059 for the low B string. One good thing I will say is they do last a very long time."
4,Durable,"I really like these strings. They're fairly priced, and I find that they're okay for a 25.5 scale length guitar. 56 gauge holds a low G just fine for me. To each his/her own. However, I usually play in A standard mostly.They loose their ""bright"" shimmering tone after a week or two. However, they don't break easily like other string brands like Dunlop, D'Addario, or Elixir. Elixirs do last longer in tone than the Ernie Ball's, but Ernie Ball is more affordable and durable."
2,Not worth the investment,"This product was a great disappointment. For a spelling bee tool, I was surprised at the number of mispronunciations and blatant misspellings. The graphics were poor and this product has a very homemade quality. It has potential, but needs serious upgrades and editing. This product was definitely NOT worth the money."
4,Locking miter bit by Freud,I HAVE BEEN A LONG USER OF FREUD ROUTER BITS ALL ARE EXCELLENT. MY NEWEST INVESTMENT IS THE LOCKING MITER BIT. A LITTLE TIME TO SET UP BUT IT'S WORTH THE TIME. THE JOINT IS SO TIGHT I TOSSED THE GLUE! KIDDING OF COURSE. I AM VERY PLEASEDBill D.
1,terrible,"Impossible to catch a thread, and once you manage to screw on a filter, does not hold it tight, and pretty bulky construction to boot. Thought I just had a defective ring, but no, they're all like this. Throwing mine away."
1,Defective,I was not able to mount my B+W filters on the 77mm side of the ring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else as it simply does not work.
5,"Simple, works great","Got a 77mm filter? Why not use it on a 58mm lens, instead of buying yet another filter?There seems to be a lot of discussion regarding good (i.e. expensive) filters as opposed to cheaper ones. This allows you to try out better filters on several lenses to make up your mind."
5,Love my Timex Indiglo,"I love this watch. It looks great, works great, and I love the indiglo feature for when I wake up and want to see what time it is without turning on the light."
3,"Great watch, until it died.","I liked this watch - it was the perfect size for me, and I I liked the movable outer dial. However, about one and a half years after I bought it, it stopped running. I took it to a jeweler to have the battery replaced, but that did not revive the watch (the battery inside it was also still had a lot of charge left). I don't know why it stopped running so suddenly, and I'm not sure if I want to take a chance on buying another watch of the same kind."
2,Terrible for vegetarians,"This book should be entitled ""101 Things to Do With a Slow Cooker AND MEAT"". Even the VEGETABLE soup has a pound of steak in it. So do the Minestrone and Tomato Soup recipes! Most non-vegetarian recipe books have some recipes for non-meat eaters, but this one really has nothing (except the dessert recipes which manage not to have beef thrown into them). The Busy People's Slow Cooker Cookbook has a MUCH better variety of recipes for meat and non-meat eaters. I recommend that book over this one. If it didn't cost more to return this cookbook than to keep it, I'd return it."
5,yummy,I ordered this one for the same reason I ordered the first one. I have a slowcooker and i like to use it.
4,Slow Cooker,Thanks for the great tips in the book. Getting up @ 4:30 am for work doesn't inspire me to make a delicious meal when I get home and this definitely make that possible
2,This is healthy cooking???,I was slightly disappointed with this book as I feel that cooking with a lot of prepackaged foods is neither tasty nor nutritious. Soda and Roast? I'm sure it is probably good but do I really want to ingest it? If you are into fresh creative ingredients my advice is to pass this one up and spend your money on a GREAT slow cooker cookbook that I recently discovered after digging through every slow cooker cookbook at my local bookstore: The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes by Judith Finlayson.
1,Not well thought out recipes,"I recently tried two of the recipes in this cookbook. The first one ""Italian Chicken with Mushrooms"". The chicken was dry but the sauce was very tasty. I thought it was strange that she had you cook chicken breasts for 3 hours on HIGH and then another 2 hours on high with the sauce. Way too long. So, I decided to try another one - ""Pork Chop Casserole"". I followed the recipe exactly as written and this time the meat was tender and juicy but the rice was a gooey gelatinous mess - gross - gave it to the dogs. Can't figure out how she came up with these recipes. I am not going to make any more of them!"
5,My other slow cooker books are collecting dust!,"This is one of the best slow cooker books I've come across. The recipes are simple, tasty, and best of all - most have very few ingredients. I love to cook, but as a busy mom, I'm tired of recipes calling for 15 ingredients. Those recipes are fine for the weekends - this book is GREAT for the busy workweek.I didn't realize until now that there is a whole series of these books - ""101 Things to do with a ___________."" Here I come!"
2,You might like some of it,"I tried two recipes - one good (easy taco soup p.43) and one too horrid to eat (chicken teriyaki p.87). The teriyaki recipe calls for an ENTIRE BOTTLE of teriyaki sauce. The result was disgusting and nasty. Many of the recipes are retarded in their cooking requirements. For example, you need to add soem ingredients in the last hour of cook time in a five hour meal. I did not buy a slow cooker so that I could babysit my food for half a day ... and many recipes have less than an 8-hour cook time, so forget leaving the cooker on and coming home from work to a fresh hot meal. There are a mix of recipes for different size cookers ... for the chef that keeps two of these things sitting around. Yeaaah. Keep your eyes open and some of the recipes are edible."
5,Slow Cooker Delights,"Its just amazing what you can do with your slow cooker. If you don't have time to stand at the stove or oven all day, put it in the slow cooker and walk away. This is the book for you."
3,Great Book!,"This book was very interesting when it comes to details and anecdotes. It had a lot of information about Becks and that was what made this book fun to read.Despite how great the book is, it can be better. It can have more detail about a few things, such as Beck's role with his boss and less details on subjects such as lossing a match and how it felt.But other than that, it is a great book and I recomment this to everyone who knows Dave and is a fan of his."
5,The Real Truth about Beckham,"I recently became a fan of David Beckham and reading this book really made me a bigger fan. I recommand this book to any David Beckham Fan. This book takes you to a journey from his childhood days, to meeting his wife Victoria (Posh Spice), his 98 World Cup experience, the birth of his two adorable sons, Brooklyn (4) and Romeo (1), his experince as a Man. U player and his reasons for leaving Man. U and joining Real Madrid. I really felt for his when he explained his experiences. I remember having tears when he talked about the birth of his son, Brooklyn.The book also has some excellent pictures of him and his family. If your a huge David Beckham fan, than I higly recommand this book."
4,Beckham - both feet on the ground,"This is a much better book than I expected. It is an easy and interesting read. I am almost ten years older than David Beckham, but I wanted to find out what he is really like (other than what is seen on the soccer field). He does a good job of telling his own story without blowing anything out of proportion. If you like soccer, this is a must read. Enjoy..."
2,Enjoyable enough to read,Good enough to read for non soccer fans but certainly not a pageturner. Even after reading the book I still feel as though I don't know much about him.
1,Bloody Bad,"This book has no insight, no important details, and no excitement. Written hastily and poorly. Needs revising and needs passion; something this book utterly lacks."
4,My Review,I thought this book was awsome. As a fan i felt that it gave me someinsight into his world.
3,Mediocre bio of outstanding footballer.,".Becks is an outstanding footballer, no doubt, and a decent story teller (although I really do wonder how much of this bio was actually written by him vs. his co-author). That said, I don't recommend this bio unless you are a serious Beckham fan, which I am not, or are interested in reading a bio that has a lot of filler. (Keano or Fergie's bios are better).Sure, there are some well written anecdotes as well as a few insights into the EPL, International Football, celebrity, fatherhood, and Becks' row with Sir Alex... but then there isn't a lot of detail in between.Finally, and perhaps what turned me off most, is that Becks, a Brit, used American spelling and vocab. Maybe there is a UK edition of the book with football instead of soccer, or realise instead of realize?This book seemed to me to be the first marketing strike in Beckham's coming invasion of America, not the memoir of one of modern football's biggest stars I hoped for."
1,Where's the Beef?,"My first bad review for a Cisco Press book. They have to agree that this book should never have been printed with Cisco's name on it.This book lacks information in so many ways. Read the section on CBWFQ and you get 1/3 of what you're looking for. I have to use Cisco's website for the rest. The FRTS section is lacking. These are just 2 examples in a book that is 1/3 the size it should be.Don't buy this book. It's simply not worth the money. No hard feelings toward the author, but I did waste my money and I have to tell others not to. I'll look forward to the next release of this book which I'm sure will include much, much more."
3,"Good, but not much more than IOS Manuals","I found the text in this book to be well presented, however, it seemed like a repeat of the excellent IOS 12.1 ""Cisco IOS QOS Config Guide"".I was hoping that the book would provide either more detail about how these functions work, or would provide some best practicies for how to apply these commands.If this is your only reference for QOS, this might be a good start. But if you already have the IOS manuals (printed or electronic) I wouldn't count on this book to be a resource for additional information."
3,"A thought-provoking book, but weak character development.","A truly thought-provoking book. ""For Kings and Planets"" can be enjoyed as a pleasant read or much more if the reader finds him/herself connecting with one of the main characters. I found the work almost poetic in the sense that, to me at least, there were rich allusions behind the words. The story's ending, however, might leave the reader unsatisfied, almost as if the author himself was not yet finished."
2,FOR KINGS AND PLANETS=BRIDESHEAD REVISITED,"I was stunned by the close parallels that one could draw from Canin's book ""For Kings and Planets"" if one had ever read Evelyn Waugh's Novel, "" Brideshead Revisited"". The latter book is the far superior version of this story, as well as the original. I am amazed that Mr. Canin, a usually very talented writer was allowed to plagerize with such a heavy hand. If you do not believe me read both and see for yourself, it is glaringly obvious. It is well written regardless. And , if you have not read Waugh's novel I am sure it would seem very good. But, I suggest if you want a really extraordinary read you should opt for Waugh."
1,Short story master once again out of his league with novel,"A book filled with lovely prose but a superficial story and hollow characters. Ethan Canin is perhaps one of this country's premier short fiction craftsmen but this second attempt at the novel (after BLUE RIVER) falls flat. Canin portrays his characters as all this or all that, failing to add dimension. The plot chugs along as predictably and as innocuously as any familiar parable. Devoid of danger and development, FOR KINGS AND PLANETS gives Canin two strikes at bat in the game of the novel."
2,"Long on melodrama, short on character","What he does brilliantly in stories--the lush language, the small moments of tenderness, the smart, clever scenes--is overblown and overdone in this novel that desperately wants to be about something big but amounts to nothing more than a story we've heard time and time again. The characters are all merely cardboard, going through their tired roles--hayseed, eccentric NYC kid--and Canin never pushes them beyond their assigned roles. In the end, this reader thought: Who Cares? A major disappointment."
3,UNEVEN,"My favorite Canin book is BLUE RIVER. His characters' relationships are complex and interesting. The first half of this book was captivating. The contrasts between Orno and Marshall were acute, and I loved the way Marshall was unconditionally drawn to Orno. I got to know Orno very well, but never could get under Marshall's skin, as I imagine is the way Orno felt. But when Marshall left for LA and became a coke addict and Hollywood type, it just didn't seem plausible, except as an extreme reaction formation to his father's influence. Both he and his father were just sort of pitiful, but i didn't feel really sympathetic toward either one of them. The relationship between Simone and Orno was sort of ho hum. I really expected some major events to occur between them, which didn't, sort of like real life! So the last half of the book was slow, but still interesting. I am already anticipating Mr. Canin's next book!"
2,The weakest of Canin's books,"Our book group concluded that this is the weakest of Canin's stories. I loved Blue River and Emperor of the Air, as did others in the group who have read them. We agreed that For Kings and Planets starts out well but loses momentum in the second half and sputters to a ho-hum finish."
2,He could do better,"Ethan Canin's previous two books were works of genius. I especially enjoyed Emperor of the Air, each story is simple but poignant, almost Carver-esque. Which makes For Kings and Planets so much more of a let down. Instead of the unobstrusive prose, Canin chose to write in flowery prose, something he is simply not good at doing. Writing a novel instead of vignettes is also not Canin's forte, as the plot goes everywhere and the third person is unconvincing. The book is also too preachy, especially about the meaninglessness of education in favor of precocity. I highly recommend Canin's short stories, they will change you. But don't pick this book as your first, because you'll never want to read this guy again. If you like to read about Ivy League schools and precocity, check out Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise and Salinger's Franny and Zooey, respectively. About boyhood relationships that turn sour, read Chabon's the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay."
4,Great main character,"I thoroughly enjoyed For Kings and Planets, mostly because of the sophisticated, clever dialog and the excellent characterization of Orno. Orno was a very sympathetic character, and his antagonist Marshall was a totally unlikeable one."
2,"No thrills, no surprises","Not the worst book I've read this year, but by no means one of the best. From the first page, when we are introduced to one ""Orno Tarcher"" from the midwest, I knew we were in for some serious manipulating on the part of the author. I was right. Velvet smoking jackets came later. Maybe Canin should stop watching soap operas and read some good books on developing characters. John Gardner comes to mind."
1,Canin is Not a Novelist,"It's 0-for-2 on the novel front for Ethan Canin. I enjoyed his ten-year-old collection of short stories, ""The Emperor of the Air,"" but found everything he has written since disappointing. Canin's characters in ""For Kings and Planets"" lie flat on the page, and the plot is so derivative and stifling I could see what was coming at every juncture. I found the ending especially maddening because I had invested a fair amount of time on this novel. It left me hungering for something surprising or meaningful or even conclusive to happen. Mostly, though, I found ""For Kings and Planets"" BORING. Canin just keeps reworking the same theme over and over and over in his writing, as if stuck in an adolescent script he can't see his way out of. Save yourself the money and pass this one up. I sure won't be buying any more books by Ethan Canin."
5,Perfect,"This was an old fashioned novel in the best sense. The characters showed the reader who they were. Their interactions were real -- confused, incomplete. The book itself was immensely satisfying. I had to finished the last 90 pages in one flew swoop because I was so terrified of what might happen to the characters. I really cared about all of them."
2,Wanted to like it so......,"Had always considered ""Emporer"" and 'Palace Thief"" to be two of most satisfying collections of short stories I've ever run across - so was terribly excited to read ""Kings and Planets"" and, like most of these reader reviews are stating, it just didn't work. Normally, I'd say - read it cause he's a brilliant writer, but if you know his stuff then save yourself from this disappointment. ALSO - what was the deal with the damn typeface? - there was this consistent extra space after a certain and often used word which now escapes me - let's just say - I put this whole experience out of my mind!!!!!"
3,Mezza Mezza,"It's a nicely written, and mildly interesting to read. That being said I did finish the book. It doesn't have a great story but yet it is enticing to move through. I really don't have a strong opinion, or feeling about this book, other then being curious about how such a book could get published. It is not interesting, unique, beautifully written, or suspenseful. It's like reading a Philip Roth novel, but not funny, nor interesting, revealing, or Jewish. I hate to give a mild review, but that is just how i feel about this book....mild."
4,"Subtle, slowly moving conclusion, builds on short stories","This is a wonderful book. It is about the main character's love for the world and and how he overcomes the deceit of a friend to redeem himself and find a place in the world. If you ever feel that the world moves too fast and that others control you and your place, read this book and see how the main characters fundamental midwest values overcome the powerful and deceitful world of a close friend."
3,Not Bad...,"My girlfriend lent me this book because of its setting at Columbia and within New York City. I read it in 2 days and was very entertained by the triangle relationship between sister and brother Simone and Marshall, and Missouri born Orno, the central character in the novel. The book reminded me of 'A Separate Peace' in that you have one character, Marshall, who is so highly talented and so charming that he has a way of bringing everyone in, and Orno, a character who for no apparent reason (at first, the reasons become apparent over time) is brought in as his closest confidant. This is the kind of text you read when you have to write a story for a creative writing professor who constantly tries to imprint the adage 'Show, Don't Tell' into your consiousness. It's a good read, but nothing to become overly ecstatic about."
3,Too much like Brideshead revisited and Great Gatsby,"Orno Tarcher, a boy from smalltown america goes to New York to study (first in his family). He soon meets the charismatic Marshall Emerson who is from a distinguished and rich family. Orno and Marshall become friends, with Marshall having the leading role/initiative. During a visit to Marshall's family, Orno is introduced to his sister. He falls in love with the sister and she with him, and they marry depsite Orno's attempts at sabotage. Things end badly for Marshall. The wrting is good, but it all is quite predictable."
4,In orbit around the charismatic genius.,"Many of us find ourselves in the orbit of a charismatic genius, usually to our disadvantage and possible destruction. What drives the the genius, in From Kings and Planets, Marshall Emerson, who consistently envies the ordinary Orno Tarcher because Marshall feels empty? And what keeps the ordinary Orno in Marshall's orbit? What must he do to escape Marshall? This character driven novel explores these questions."
3,Dissappointing,"I find the premise of the novel enticing- a wide eyed innocent seduced by savier peers. Unfortunately, Canin seems like he is going thru the motions with this book, and he leaves the reader with one-deminsional characters.The author's strength lies in his ability to keep a secret out there- from the reader, the protaganist, or perhaps both- and then have it revealed, making us all the wiser. The portrayal of a former baseball great in The Palace Thief and what the depiction says about the american character comes to mind, as well as the prep school teacher's epiphany.I kept waiting for this in his new novel, but Canin dissappoints, for he bangs you over the head, almost didactically. Did he lose interest and have to meet a deadline?I hope he regains his intensity in his next work, and uses his skillful eye to better advantage."
