2,Horse Facts for little kids,"I bought this to show to a group of 9 year olds in an after school camp class. They found it quite boring and lost attention quickly. It is very slow. I would only encourage this for pre-K...unless the children you are showing have no horse knowledge or you are trying to teach spanish. I love the authors books, but this DVD was a flop for my purposes."
1,Only lasted 6 months,"I purchased this kit for my son for Christmas to go along w/his PS2 system. The controller worked great at first, but then you could not make left turns with it anymore - the steering went.The controller was good while it lasted but only lasted 6 months. I now have a MadKatz one we are trying out to see if that lasts. (PS - the Sony controller that comes w/the PS2 system is still going strong)."
2,similar problem to the last reviewer...,"I got one of these like a year ago. The romote control and extention cord are still serving me well, but the controller doesn't work AT ALL. It worked fine for about a half-an-hour and then the PS2 didn't recognize it was plugged in, and the red analog light wouldn't come on and the buttons wouldn't work or anything. It's totally dead... But as I said, the remote and extention cord are fine, so I decided to give it 2 stars..."
1,Do NOT buy this....,"I bought this starter kit for my PS2, so that I could have a second controller. I originally saw this kit, because a friend of mine had it, and it worked perfectly. The second I open it to use mine at home, and the system won't recognize it worth a darn. I am returning this and hopefully getting my money back! :-/"
2,"Sad, it was not a good quality item. don't buy","Well, this kit includes a remote and a receiving unit. work fine but feels cheap construction. the receiver unit is attached to your PS2 controller port. the receiver has a built in controller port so that you are able to connect your PS2 Original or other controller.No problem with the extension cord. however please note that if you are using the remote you wont be able to connect in port built in the remote receiver's neither of the included Controller or the extension. thone only fit the PS2 ports. that was really frustrating.the picture shows a bag, which my set did not include.and at last, about the controller, it was defective and useless.I guess i am to blame for buying such cheap items.However please be warned: don't waste your money."
2,low standard equipment.,"Sony Playstation 2 Starter Kit Turbo ShockI bough this item three weeks ago, brand new and Im having problems with the analog sticks already ,I will like to returned but Im deploy in iraq right now and I dont have access to the post office so I dont recomend this product at all, thank you."
4,I Didn't Know If I'd Like It Until....,"I must admit, I was skeptical that I'd like this one at first.Especially, when I saw that had evidently flipped the photo on the cover.It took a little while to receive.But, when I got it and put it in the player....WOW!The sound is clean and crystal clear.And even includes some countdown and studio chatter.A nice little extra.My suggestion, is to put it in your player and just let it play through.What a treat."
3,Iz isn't,"This is an interesting piece to see the Hawaiian legend perform. I was not impressed with the total package ,however. Perhaps it was less than was expected because it was recorded so long aqo."
3,"Island Music, Island Hearts review",Would have been nice if it was longer....with a lot more songs...especially english ones!
4,Great selections & commentary,"There are 3 editions more recent than this one so make sure what you need is in here. For the casual reader, however, the stories are extremely well picked. The introductions to each author give a little context (although they are mainly a list of other works by that author) and the commentary at the end of each story help put everything in perspective (and help the reader understand what has happened)."
2,Blank pages!,"For the most part, the anthology is decent. Although, for such a large anthology of short stories (800 pages or so) it seems like there some interesting choices and omissions.The problem is that there are BLANK PAGES in some sections. Entire pages: 466-467, 470-471, 474-475, 478-479, which are right in the middle of short stories. Unbelievable. Great job, Fondo de Cultura Economica!"
3,"Pretty good, but not as good as I expected.","I don't think I would have purchased it if I would have seen a preview, but his music is still great. I expect more when I purchase a entertainer's DVD."
5,Hot,"IZ's (May he rest in peace) popularity seems to be growing...and I now know why. He is a wonderful performer, such tremendous musical talent and a delightful personality. His deep convictions also come across in his music and his commitment to Hawaii and Hawaiian people -- but not in a way that comes across as being against the rest of the world. Most highly recommended."
4,IZ forever!,Small personal venues depicting the IZ in two different times of his career. Sounds awesome on my surround sound theatre. I have ever transformed some very unlikely people into heavy IZ followers.
1,Look before you buy,"The pictures are staged, and in many the horses look less than noble. Who wants to see pictures of horses with an (...) or breeding? Who wants to see pictures of a horses with a canvas back drop, stage lights and yet in the middle of a beautiful landscape? A weird and an strange book. I was disappointed to say the least. Buyer beware."
5,beautiful beyond compare!!!,"Do you like Munnings? Do you like Stubbs paintings? Then you will adore this book. The photos, taken around the world, are taken against a broad long well lit canvas. Some of the photos show the horses and riders or owners standing against the canvas behind which are snow-capped mountains or long low plains. It is an uplifting book. It will make you happy.The lighting is varied giving rise to different moods, feelings, emotions. The horses are splendid."
2,Horses Book,"I was not overly impressed with this book. Many of the pictures were very dark, or poorly lite. I am an equine artist, and bought it solely for the pictures. I ended up reselling it on Amazon as I didn't find it of much use. There are some neat pictures, and some very interesting breeds though. The writing was good, and I did learn some interesting things about different breeds."
2,dissapointed,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I didn't realize the book is so small, about half the size of an 8"" by 11"" piece of paper. The pictures are all very dark, set against a brown backdrop. I got this book for an elderly man who used to raise horses and now lives in a convalescent home. I think he will have trouble seeing these pictures or reading the text. I wish I had gone with another book."
4,gift,This book was a gift to a friend. He is a horse trainer. He loves the book and is very happy with it.
3,Interesting information but dark photos,"I bought this book for my artist daughter who adores horses. I read the reviews and decided this was for her...information regarding horses throughout the world, not just American breeds. The information was what I thought it would be. The people were as interesting as the equine information but I was not happy with the photos. If the photographer spent five years of his life taking these photos, it's a shame he didn't use more lighting. Some are so dark that you can't discern the horses from the backdrop. The photos taken outside with countryside behind the photo shoot were very interesting."
2,"Sorry, but I don't get it.","Maybe this deserved a three, but to offset all the 5's I've entered a two star rating. Basically, I agree with the comments made by the two and below star commenters--darkish photos, small book, disappointing. Maybe I just don't have a discerning eye for photography(?). Am I missing something here? The paper quality, size of the book, lighting of the photos, clarity, all seem lacking to me. Maybe it's art and I'm missing something. But if you are looking for photos that jump out at you like say photos suitable for a horse calendar, this is NOT it. Amazingly, I would venture to guess that not even one photo is ""horse calendar"" material. Not one. So back to my point. Maybe horse calendar photography is ""commercial art."" I must be missing something here because the photographer is said to be award winning."
2,hard to get down,The shipping was fast however the smell and the taste made it very hard for me to drink this product. I tried to chugg it but I couldn't drink the whole glass I ended up giving it away.
3,Not Sourdough,"Warning: somebody must have messed up the packaging at the factory. These are not sourdough, these are plain.The crackers are crispy and virtually tasteless.Edit: I was just eating one of the crackers, and I noticed something crawling on my lip. The previous reviewer is right. These are full of small bugs. The bugs are hard to notice, but smash a cracker on a white piece of paper, and you will see them.Yuck. I just ate half a pack."
4,Yummie!!!!!!!!,I actually got a case of these at the store. They are so light. I first had these when in Europe while in the service. I carry these in the winter to work in case I get snowed in. It's happened. I can put just about everything on it. Or I can eat them plain. They are also good for dipping into thick soup or stew. My only grump about them is the packaging. Once you open the thing the crisp bread starts going stale after a couple of days. Even after placing them in a plastic bag or container. That is why I gave them 4 stars.
3,Freq Nasty - Transforma/Amped,"Freq Nasty has a way with breaks, but these two tracks don't really showcase what he can do. Sure, the beats are tight, but the tracks as a whole don't show a lot of personality. ""Amped"" shows some promise about halfway in, when a metallic melody pierces through, but, personally, I was hoping for more."
1,"Caution This is a "" Guardian"" Model by Medline","Purchased for 92 Yr old who is slightly unsteady with balance. this unit is well built, sturdy and sits firmlyon the floor. Easy to clean container which is actually a pail within a pail ( open bottom insert) No leaks, no spills and most importantly no odor with lid in placeUPDATE: This is not the same cammode i purchased 2 years ago with an excellent rating. This one has to be built, has smaller container and not as strong. Both sold by Medline probably different manufacters. I do not appreciate my original review being used with this item..NOTE: Contact Amazon before purchase. make sure it is not the Guardian G30213-4F or G30210-4F This is not the original assembled model( Not recommended)"
1,seat too small,"The commode is easy to put together, but the seat is very flimsy and my 93 year old mother (who weighs only 115 pounds) found it too small even for her tiny frame. None of the product descriptions (of any brand) give the dimensions for the seat... Will now have to go to a medical supply store to actually see and test the seats."
2,NOT THE ITEM ORDERED,I ordered the 4-in-1 Steel Commode from this supplier and received the Folding bedside commode. I have no choice but to keep it as I have someone who needs it starting today. I order the 4-in-1 because I believed it would be more stable. Now I have to use this one and I am not very happy. What happened to control check points from the shipping order to the warehouse where this was pulled for shipping? The packing slip is clearly marked 4-in-1 but that is not what was shipped. If it was a replacement because the other was not available I should have at least been told that. I am not very happy with this order. Caveat Emptor
2,not what I expected,"I purchased this to be used as a raised seat for the toilet that could be easily moved by other family members. It fit over the toilet fine but the seat opening is too small to ""take care of business"" and also the seat is rather flimsy. It would cost me as much as I paid for it to send it back so I will be donating it to a local nursing home."
1,Did the job,"I found that after adjusting the legs, this item did the job it was intended for. It was used for an elderly person and the price was right."
3,nothing great - there are better products,extremely compact and the seat is pretty small with not much space for movement - bought it based on reviews but the reviews were not accurate. only extremely small and thin body shape can use it. the pail is also small.
3,quality,3 second-hand books were ordered. There was a big difference 1) between the paper quality and general state of each book 2)betweein the speed and efficiency of delivery. Let me know if you want the details.
4,This is the only record in german,"Some singers in this CD are not good enough, but If you want/need the german version, this CD is the only option I found. So, I'm grateful that these people did this record."
2,The actual exam was easier than this book......,"I liked that this book was all practice multiple choice questions, similar to the actual exam but to be honest the questions scared me and were wayyyyyyyyyy too detailed compared to the exam. I think it could make you study stuff that you don't need to as opposed to concentrating on pertinent stuff on the test. I did badly on these questions but easily passed the test. let's just end it there......"
2,"Critical Care Examination Review Revised, 3rd Edition","Not as good as Pass CCRN in this RN's eyes: It doesn't have as easy access CD rom and it has an even worse rationale and nothing in terms of textbook style information. Although Pass CCRN is not too much better, it does have some textbook material to go over."
2,Not what I expected,Short and sweet: It's a big book of multiple choice questions on the CCRN systems. If you are looking for 'cliff's notes' on the exam ......... this isn't it.
4,Not Bad!,"This book was full of questions categorized by system. It was close to the questions on the CCRN and helped a lot with multisystem, renal, pulm, hematology, etc in my case. I am a CVICU RN and did not need cardiac very much but read the book through 3 times the weekend before the test and passed. Easy to understand rationales that are very thorough. Would also recommend the CCRN practice exam booklet from AACNs bookstore website!"
2,Way too much information,Unless you have a lot of time to read this but this book went into too much detail. Not very helpful in preparation of the test. More like a CCRN Encyclopedia if you ask me.
2,please credit my refund to my account,I returned this product and have gotten the confirmation email and my AMEX account has not been credited yet. Can you please credit my account. TY Rebeca O'Neill It was the wrong book.
3,An intriguing movie,"This is a story of three lifelong friends who spend a night with a promiscuous woman who later has an accident and tries to avoid having her family find out about her promiscuity by falsely accusing the men of raping her. Sounds weird? Yes, this is a somewhat odd movie. It mixes drama and comedy and tackles moral questions. It works for the most part. Trust me, it's more interesting than my plot summary!"
3,"Very Basic, Was hoping for more","I was looking for a little more of a ""workout"" that would be kind to my spine. This video seemed more to emphasize proper stretching, but I didn't feel that it provided instruction on strengthening like I had hoped."
5,Best Scissors,"I have been using these type Fiskar scissors for many years. I purchased these scissors for a x-mas present for my son's girlfriend. She is learning to sew, so I wanted her to have the perfect pair of shears. They never seem to get dull."
4,Beware of Size of Scissors for Large hands,"The rating of four out of five stars (instead of a full five stars) is really just my own fault, as follows: Both my husband and daughter are left-handed, so I thought buying a pair of left-handed scissors would be a good idea. But although the scissors are quite nice, they are girl-sized (ladies size 7 glove). I will save them for my daughter who is off at college and purchase another pair, this time being very mindful that they be large enough for a burly guy with large hands. So, if you buy these, be mindful of the size of the handles if you are buying them for a large-handed leftie."
4,Good value,Scissors are all-purpose and good for general home or office use. The double-pack option makes them an even better value.
3,Lefty scissors,"Bought this for my lefty husband and he complains the finger opening is too small. So, guess it is fine for smaller hands but probably not for the medium to larger mens hands."
1,Really Are NOT left-handed,Look at the photo closely. The blades overlap like a standard right-handed pair (top blade on right when looking at the handle). Then look at the actual left-handed ones on Amazon or anywhere else. The top blade is on the Left. These are just ordinary right handed scissors with a modified handle. When I went to return them the invoice even SAYS right handed!
1,Not my mom's scissors,"After a month or so of owning a pair of these, one of the blades broke at the pivot while cutting open some plastic packaging. The dog-chewed-up-the-handle pair that my parents have had for what seems like decades would have had no problem.These are not the scissors I was looking for. Perhaps I got a knock-off pair? I don't know, but I am disappointed."
5,Fiskars Scissors,My sister is left handed and she loves them. She had never heard of Fiskars Scissors but I have been using my right handed one for 15 years. They are the best pare of scissors you can buy!!! Mine came with a blade cover and Blade sharpener..
5,Perfect puppy,"This is a wonderful, old-fashioned toy that is sturdy and appealing. It's just what I wanted for my nephew!"
1,Consumer Reports missed on this one,"I follow Consumer Reports ratings quite closely and often purchase the products they rate as best buys. Every now and then, one of the best buys turns out to be a dud, and this is one of them.The range on this phone is TERRIBLE! I've also had callers say my voice sounded muffled, the phone has cut out on me only a couple feet from the base unit(while fully charged) and sometimes I get ""digital delay"" during a conversation.I don't know if these problems are common with the 6.0 phones, as this is the first I've had of this type. All I know if the old phone I replaced (unfortunately now broken due to hard impact) worked flawlessly 30 yards from the base unit and had great voice quality.I would NOT purchase this phone again or recommend it to anyone."
4,Nice Phone,Nice Phone. Smaller then our old one & you may be accidently hitting keys before you get use to it. Very light. I don't understand why on these cordless phones they don't make the ear piece fit your ear better. They are all alike. Except for that its a good phone for the price.
2,Did not work as well as it should,"I recieved my Panasonic Phone in perfect condition, however, noone likes to talk to me on it because of the loud buzzing and fuzz. Also it does react to the internet. If the phone is in use, the internet cannot be. That was why I bought the phone, because it was promised not to interfear with internet. I am truley dissapointed."
2,Not as good as I thought,"It is an average basic phone. Sometimes, there is a lot of static to the point I can not even hear anything but static. The design is out dated. The buttons are not back lit. I think it is over priced."
2,Did not work right out of the box,handset did not work brand new out of the box - could not be synchronized to the base. was a hassle to return to panasonic. still have not received replacement. very weak.
1,Very Poor Volume Control,"I just bought this phone as a gift based on the great reviews. I am currently returning it due to very poor volume control. During a conversation, the volume starts out normal then minutes later fades out so that you can no longer hear the other person even while increasing the handset volume. Going back to Uniden."
5,"good product, nice minimal packaging","The phone works great. I'm excited that it uses standard rechargeable AAA batteries. Those will be much easier to maintain. I like being able to listen to the answering machine from the handset. The calls are very clear all over and outside the house.As a plus, panasonic ships these in very compact packaging - well protected during shipment, but much less material to dispose of after opening than typical electronics."
5,GREAT PHONE SYSTEM !,"I recently purchased the Panasonic ""Dect 6.0"", Model # KX-TG1032S). It's superb ! It does so much more than the Uniden I had. The Uniden would static if I was on the computer. The Panasonic does not. The only complaint I have is that when you miss a call and the caller leaves a message it does not ""beep"" to tell you. You have to walk over to the base unit and see if a light is blinking. The purchase through Amazon was 5-star !"
3,Not As Perfect As They Claim,"This is the second 6.0 phone I have purchased and both had a low grade static on the line that did not exist with my 5.8ghz phone. Now, granted, I use a broadband phone line so maybe that is the culprit. However, I ended up returning the phone and buying new batteries for my old one."
2,Not impressed,This prooduct does not have the battery life that it claims. even the range is questionable. Its good for adjacent rooms....but thats not what I want to use it for!!!
5,Great phone,"A phone shouldn't be complicated. This is a great, inexpensive phone that is easy to program, has a strong signal and a long battery life. I've been very happy with it."
2,Disappointing,"I did lots of research on phones because we've had terrible luck lately in this department. These phones were rated very highly so I bit the bullet and purchased them when they went on sale.They work for a couple of months but the handsets eventually stop connecting to the base. And when they do connect, they cut in a out to where the person on the other end can't understand what you are saying.I just want a decent phone that works, but this is not it."
4,works beautifully,"I really like this phone. I had an older version of Panasonic cordless phone which eventually stop charging its phone and always had a major static problem -- which is a pain in a neck whenever I make an international call to speak with my mother oversea who has a hearing impairment. With this phone, I hear no static and she could hear me without any interruption. Why didn't I invest my money to buy DECT phone earlier... I do recommend this product to those who have yet experienced DECT cordless phone."
5,Best Phone I've Owned,This is the best home phone I've owned. We bought it over a year ago and works great. I use the speakerphone all the time with no echo or interference. Being able to share phone entries between handsets is another big plus.Keys are large and easy to see.Highly Recommend.
5,Works great,"I bought this phone based on reviews from this site. No WiFi interference even though the base unit is close to my router. Supports FSK and has an indicator for new voice mail. You must still dial your service provided to hear the messages. Simple instructions, very easy to set up."
5,Great!,very fast delivery! big buttons. light-weighed. my parents fell in love with them the first day they opened the box!
3,Panasonic COrdless Telephone,"I believe this is over rated as I believed it had a longer range..I was looking for something to work in my backyard..It is approx. 165 feet long, and this works maybe through half the yard. I was more than slightly disappointed in the product. It is better than my last cordless phone, but far less than I expected it to be. I would not recommend this to someone who is looking for range, since it is a disappointment."
3,Disappointing Range,"I bought this as a replacement for a Phillips Dect phone that I bought without realizing it had no headset jack. The Panasonic has some nice features, but the battery life and range on the handset are worse than the Phillips."
4,Dect 6.0,Was extremely pleased with the Panasonic Dect 6.0 answering system. It works where others had failed and it is so convenient not to have to get up and get the phone in the other room. It's terrific.
3,It's alright but....,"I received the phones quickly and I ordered this particular set because I have wireless internet in my house. It was easy to hook up, and even setting up all the features were easy (it would have been easier had my son not thrown away the instructions). The one thing I am dissappointed with is the sound quality. For this pricepoint, I expected clear speech both on the caller and the callees end. My sound quality as the caller is hit and miss, but I have to be careful where I walk in the house or the callee gets nothing but static. Its not like its a big house either.. only 1100 sq ft. If my son had not thrown out the box, I would have returned the phones."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Cordless Phone,We have been using this phone for about a month. It is a great phone for the money. I have not had any trouble with the phone. One thing that I like about the phone is you can hear the answering system through the handset when off the base. The only negative I have is that the base does not have a speaker which I used alot with my last phone. All and all this is a good phone system and I have been pleased.
4,easy to use,Nice looking phones with many options. The phones are easy to use. I even bought a set for my mother who is over eighty years old.
2,Distance,"The handsets are not usable unless they are very close to the base. In a 2000 sq ft home, I should be able to use the handsets from any room in my home."
3,Batteries?,"I purchased these for use at a remote location where I am at the end of the lines from telephone equipment and have poor service. There is some difficulty hearing well with them. I have the same phones at another location where they are clear as a bell.However one of the new handsets has repeatedly indicated one bar-low battery condition in spite of being on the charger with the charge light on, little use and being in service for only several weeks. I am in the process of returning and a replacement set has been received. Pain to have to re-enter auto dial and other setup features. Cannot exchange just the one handset or batteries. Hopefully the replacements will function well."
4,Good value. Good features and quality,I have had my phone about 2 years and am happy with my purchase. I like that the extra handset has all the features of the main headset like speaker phone. I had a Panasonic before for several years and stuck with the brand again. I miss the voicemail counter. It is easy to accidently erase messages not intended to be erased. Be careful. Buttons on the phone are a nice size. Wish the keypad was backlit. Overall a solid phone.
4,Nice Phones - A few Negatives,"Good phones, great range and sound quality. No lit keypad, No number of messages indicator, and the wall mount is basically just attaching the flat base to the wall so that it sticks out horizontally. It comes out form the wall like a ledge that the phone sits in."
4,cordless phone system,"When my puppy ate the 12V recharger cord of our previous telephone, I selected this set as an upgrade replacement. It has been easy to use and works as advertised. The one feature which I haven't adjusted to yet is the constant display of missed calls. I manually erased all the calls (including some which I had added to the phonebook) and the missed call display still shows them and took away the phonebook entries. I haven't yet taken the time to fully read the instructions yet so this may simply be a problem easily resolved."
4,"Good performance, good value","I purchased this two-handset phone after reading reviews on Amazon. Other reviews commented on the clarity of the sound. I agree. I like the size, weight, and style of the handsets; they have large buttons - including an easy-to-use speakerphone option. A previous phone was also a Panasonic and it performed well over many years. I'm very happy with this product."
4,Good reception,this phone has a very good range in wood houses. Although it is not impresive in concrete buildings! but still better than others i tried.
4,Out of the stone age,"It's wonderful to have multiple handsets that really work. Great battery life, easy to program, dependable message taking (even if the high volume setting is still a little low.) Takes up very little table space and is stable (a big plus!) Very pleased with the product and have tried many."
2,Nice features but no range,"I bought this item based on favorable reviews, but unfortunately am returning it. I'm in a one bedroom apartment, and find that its range is severely limited. It only operates well on line of sight with the base unit."
4,Panasonic KX-TG10325,"This phone performs as expected and has excellent sound quality. However, if you have a cat that likes to chew cords, the plug-in line is too fragile and can be destroyed in a snap."
2,difficult voice mail,"While the Panasonic 6.0 Cordless Phone provides excellent voice quality, I have found the answering machine difficult to program and I have added the voice mail from AT&T, my local carrier. The message machine continually broadcasted messaging over speakerphone regardless of my staff's attempts to turn it off."
5,Super Purchase,These phones are the best portable phones I've ever owned. I highly recommend this product.
5,Excellant,"These phones are wonderful. I have 2 separate phone lines in my home, both have these phones. Neither of them interferes with one another. They are clear, no interference and have a lot of useful features, caller ID and redial #'s are stored/saved. A very useful jack for headphones is on the headsets which most new phones do not have. It's easy to use and compact in size."
3,so far so good,I recently purchased this item and have had it only a short time but seems to be a good value for the money. It is hard to evaluate something unless you've had it for a while. I will be sure to come back at a later date and update you. Good luck!
1,I will never order from amazon again,"the phone was listed as in stock, it still is..I ordered for a birthday gift. Just found out three days before the birthday, that the supplier doesn't even have it in stock..the third time that this has happned.."
2,This phone is sub-par...,It looks nice and all but there's little thing that will bug you over time. Trust me. Get another phone. You'll grow to hate this one...
2,Wish this set had some style - ugly handsets.,"I'm sure this product works great, thanks to consumerreports and the other reviews. However, when I received the item and pulled out the first handset, I realized I couldn't bear to have that ugly thing in my home. For top-of-the-line technology, they look like cheap plastic handsets from 20 years ago. I returned the item and will get something more aesthetically pleasing. This may seem silly, but if you can't stand to look at it the set won't do you much good."
3,failed to fast,"I read the reviews for this on Consumer Reports and they raved about it. I'm going to rave a bit less. I've looked at cordless phones for a while and had the growing sense that they're all kind of cheap. This phone hasn't changed that impression by much. The sound quality is okay. Not stellar. Not bad. But I'd give it a B. It just isn't as good as my old cordless that finally died. Also, it's not terribly comfortable on my ear, it's as if the earpiece is too small or something. Again, the old phone was more comfy. I suspect they made this smaller to look cooler and sleeker. I don't need cool and sleak, I need a cordless that works well and feels good. So, in retrospect, would I buy this again? No. Yes it works, and yes it's not terribly expensive. I haven't had any other problems with it, but hey, if the sound isn't perfect and it doesn't feel 100% great on my ear, then those are big negatives in my book for a phone. So I can live with this phone fine - but love it? Not so much."
5,everything i wanted,Great clarity and I love that it has a place for an earpiece and that it has a belt clip.
1,Battery gives out too soon,"This phone was a monumental disappointment. The box says it has 17 hours of talk time, but for both handsets, the charge gave out after 17 minutes! Then it takes another 7 hours to fully recharge. When I replaced the batteries, it made no difference. I use it for conference calls which can run up to 3 hours, so it has to go back to the store...."
2,Handset to answer machine - On the blink,I purchase this dual phone in November 2009. The handset to the answering machine no longer shows caller I.D.The LCD screen no longer works. I have just the price online @amazon for this replacement part of the dual phones.This portion will cost me $88.00. Much more than I paid for the two phones. I find this to be rip off.
2,Short life!,"I bought this phone in 2008. Now, in Jan,2011, one phone stopped working. After talking to customer service I was told it needed service and would cost $90 plus $10 s&h.I only paid $63 for the whole thing new. It obviously meant I had to buy a new phone. I determined not to buy another Panasonic, but soon saw I didn't have much choice if I wanted any quality at all. A sad commentary on today's products made in China."
3,Phone is OK but the usable +range is a little dissappointing.,"The functionality of the phone and answering machine are first rate with no complaints, the usable range of the hand sets is a bit disappointing, I would say you start to loose signal at about 65 feet with three interior walls.I have a much older Panasonic answering machine with remote hand sets that has external antenna's and those have an outstanding range, I can talk on the phone inside a metal barn about 200' from the base unit that is inside a house with one of those older hand sets."
3,Poor range,"It's possible that we received an especially faulty item, but ours was fraught with problems. The biggest problem was a very short range from the base, with calls being dropped or at times the sound not working on on end of a call (though I'm not sure that's related to the range). The caller I.D. has problems not showing names, and occasionally the ringer on one of the units rings continuously, rather than ring/pause/ring/pause. Sending them back for something else."
4,Dect cordless phone review,"I like the product and it has good sound quality. I don't like the fact that you only store 50 numbers in the phonenook. Otherwise, the phone is excellent."
2,Many Defects,"I bought this phone after much research, but must have gotten a defective one. After loading all phone #s into phonebook, the phonebook feature only works about 10% of the time. Most times I retrieve phone #, click on talk, and get a dial tone. Extremely frustrating. Once in a great while, it works. Also had same problem with erratic volume, mentioned elsewhere, and recently got message that I was too far from the handset even when I was standing next to it!! I do like the ease of dialing, the large numbers, and the features of this phone, but we use the phonebook constantly. If the phonebook worked, I'd be satisfied, even with the other defects. Not sure if it's too late to return, since we didn't take the time to enter phone #s until we'd had the phone for almost a month. Then we thought it was just that we were not using it correctly. But we finally checked the instructions and we were doing it exactly as stated in manual."
4,Panasonic Phones,These phones are significantly better than the ones they replaced. The voice quality of both the calls and playback on the answering machine are terrific. Like many of the newer devices there are so many features that you will need to spend time reading through the instructions to learn how to use all of them.
1,Disappointed,"Panasonic KX-TG1033S Dect 6.0 Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System with 3 HandsetsWhat Consumer Reports did not report is that the volume must be adjusted for each call. I have difficulty hearing and need to have the volume adjustment remember where it was last set. Also found the volume,once adjusted, dropping sharply during the call. On one occasion I tried to share a call with a 2nd handset and received a BUSY message and tone. Too bad since this phone system has many admirable features. Following Panasonic's advise, I removed AC power from the base and handsets and disconnected the base from the telephone line for at least one minute - then I reconnected the system. It seemed to help for a while, but then the problem returned."
5,"It's a Panasonic, You can't go wrong","I bought this phone as V-Tech phone didn't work out. Actually this was my 3rd choice after Uniden.I thought the phone was ugly and really didn't like the orange backlight(I hate orange); but the looks has grown on me.This phone stays charged up for the 7-10 days they said it would, range is great as I used it 4 houses down the street with no lost in sound quality.Copying of phonebook from one phone to another is easy, and you can get your messages from the handset. Also you can make changes to the handset and it will change the other handset as well. I also like the ringtone choices.I think this will be a great phone for the years to come, My girlfriend went and bought one herself."
3,KX-TG1032 HAC -- NOT!,"All of Panasonic's literature describe the KX-TG1032S as Hearing Aid Compliant (HAC). My wife and I may be the last couple in the nation to get caller ID, one of the functions that attracted me to the KX-TG1032S. However, after getting hearing aids in both ears just over a year ago, my prime objective was to get a phone that would not ""screech"" in my ear every time I tried to have a conversation. Indeed, I now say, ""Excuse me, I didn't hear that clearly. Would you please repeat what you said."" about as frequently as I did without hearing aids. Only now it is because of the screech of the telephone in my ear rather than my inability to hear.I have had the telephone approximately 48 hours and now know that HAC for this particular telephone is a myth. If you have hearing aids, keep looking!!Jim In Plano"
4,Panasonic Cordless phones,"I have been pleased with this phone set. It has more functions that our previous set, like conference calling, and the reception is clearer."
5,Cordless phone review,"I had a Panasonic cordless for over 5 years. It finally started giving problems and call drops. I was pretty satisfied with that one, so I chose Panasonic again. I haven't had any problem with this one so far. It was easy to use. I just read the user manual for copying phone numbers from one handset to another. I was expecting it to be automatic but it is manual. Anyway it works nicely. Haven't noticed any audio quality improvements from my previous non DECT phone. But i guess my previous one was very good too. Haven't seen any issues with Battery, so can not comment on Battery life."
5,Great Phone!,"This is a wonderful phone. Easy to read number keys and great reception.If you need a phone, this may be the one you are looking for. Go for it."
1,Poor design reduces functionality,"While this phone appears to be a solid performer loaded with features, its flawed wall-mount design makes it a non-option for my household. The wall mount adapts the phone base to the wall in a horizontal position -- just as the base is seen in the photo. When attached to the wall, it protrudes awkwardly far from the wall, and at typical phone installation height, it is impossible to use any features operated from the base. Back it goes to Amazon."
4,"Sounds great, no static","I've had this phone for about a month, and so far am happy with it. It sounds great and hasn't had any static. My only complaint is that it is not very comfortable against my ear. If I'm going to be talking for a while I usually plug in a headset to it. Overall, I'd recommend it."
4,Good phones,"We are happy with this product. We have found them to be reliable and comfortable to use. The speaker phone on the headsets and mute capability has helped me dial into phone conferences meetings for work. The phone-to-phone intercom has also been handy. We rely on our cell phones heavily, so we haven't made much use of the built in phone book."
5,Great phones!,These phones are about the 3rd or 4th we've tried. We love the Panasonic! The sound is very clear and it has a great battery life. Easy to use.
3,Decent Product For a Decent Price,I have enjoyed using Panasonic cordless telephones for years and this model did not disappoint. Set up was quick and easy. Enough features and ease of handset use makes this a smart choice. Small base allows a comfortable fit on my cluttered desk. The two handsets in my small apartment keeps the sound clear and interference free. Good value for the price.
5,"A definite good product......not only for clarity, but features",I was given this product for a gift and was a little leary of it's being a good phone.....My worries were over on the first day of usage.....It has many features I never had before.....the clarity is amazing....and I love everything about it....Have used for a month now and am very pleased with it's overall quality !!!I would recommend to anyone wanting good clarity in a house with three levels of all of today's wireless products being used...
5,Panasonic has a good record with me!,"I have this phone for two weeks and have no complaints. In the past I have spent over one humdred dollars for panasonic phones with answering machines. I have tried other phones but find that panasonic has the best sound quality and features. I love that this phone has a choice of ring options that included 'jingle bells'. The slimmer feel of the handset takes getting used to, but is not a problem. It is pretty user friendly and definitely gets five stars, factoring in the reasonable price.It was delivered very quickly, as are 99.5% of all items I receive from amazon directly."
5,Works great!,I like these phones. I usually buy cheap uniden phones. I bought a set of these for my house. My aunt liked them so much I bought her a pair for Christmas. The work great and reception goes way down the street. I'm very happy with these phones. They don't have the flashiest of menus but they are solid performers with clear reception and long range.
1,Piece of utter crap - don't be fooled by good reviews,"This is the second set I've owned, 3 handsets per set, so 6 all together. I suspect highly that the good reviews are due to people reviewing the phone too soon after purchasing. It works great for a while and then turns to junk. Both times I've owned this phone. It's too late of course to return it and the warranty service stinks. So I get to throw the thing away and try to find a decent phone.Panasonic should be ashamed to produce this piece of junk.Be forewarned - if you buy anyway because of all the good reviews, you'll most likely be sorry."
1,Not satisfied,The sound quality is poor.The call waiting button is hard to seeIf I would have known I never would have purchased this product.
1,Don't buy Panasonic Cordless Phones!,"I purchased 2 Panasonic cordless phone systems (2 bases, and 5 phones in total). The 3-phone system was dead in a couple months and the 2-phone system just died (after 2 years). Whatever you do stay away from Panasonic phones!"
2,Not Satisfied,"This is the first product I am returning to Amazon. I bought this phone based on other reviews and have been utilizing it for the past week. It was purchased to replace another Panasonic 5.8 phone where the battery died. This new 6.0 DECT phone has a lot of interference and many people I am talking to have stated that they can not hear me, I sound like I am either on a cell phone or in a tunnel, or the voice reception is breaking up. The volume isn't great and the speaker phone reception is just so so. I am disappointed in this phone."
2,"I Should Have Known Better, but I Always Trusted Panasonic",The volume on the phone and the answering machine is VERY low at it's highest level. Cheaply made. I will have to replace this soon. I am surprised that Panasonic could make such an inferior product. I should have known better. A $52 phone is still a $52 phone.
1,Disappointed,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I have a been nothing but disppointed. I live in a 2300 square foot home the the phones lose signal in the house, won't charge all the way."
2,garbage. Lasted 2 years then died.,Stunned to find amazon still selling these. I bought these in 2008 and by 2010 they were dead. Both handsets quit within a month of each other. $60 (they were $78 in 2008) cordless phones should last longer than two years. Maybe I am just naive.These phones take AAA rechargeables. I thought the batteries had just gone bad. So I spent 15 bucks on good quality replacements. No luck.
3,phone,"The instruction book telling how to install, feature use, etc. is written in such a way that it is hard to understand. Most of them do not make sense to us that are techno challanged."
1,Piece of Junk,"This phone is a joke. The handset in our office, regardless of whether the base is in another room, or in the office, rarely works. We always get the message that it is too far from the base. Odd, because our 14-year-old Panasonic cordless works in our office while the base is in the kitchen, in fact, it works in every room in the house, and outdoors as well. We're planning on returning this phone and buying another because we need a phone in our office. Had we known what we know now, we NEVER would have purchased it. We have had the phone since last December -- about 6 months. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this telephone."
1,So disappointed in sound quality,"I bought this phone because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and I wanted the answering machine with ability for caller id. The sound kept lowering while I talked. I would click it up to the highest volume. which was still too low. I tried it in different rooms, just to be sure that wasn't the problem.After calling customer service, I mailed it for repair, costing me $10. I was shocked, they do not send back a new phone set, but a refurbished handset!Guess what? the refurbished phone still has sound problems. I guess I am out of luck. I don't want to keep sending it back for refurbishing at $10 a pop."
3,IiNSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL,As with many instructional manuals I was confused with how to do many of the functions particularly deleting information.
5,Panasonic Cordless Phone,Excellent product with good quality sound and ease in operation and would recommend a great value for the money.
5,Perfect for my use,"The PanDect6 arrived rapidly and as soon as I had it out of the box and plugged in, it worked! I only had to refer to the instructions once, a week after I had been using it. Very intuitive operation, at least for me. I use it for my voip ""line"" and has to date performed flawlessly.Very satisfied and would recommend."
3,Prince,"Brought this item after reading great reviews,but this cordless phone is little bit over rated than what it really should be. Cons:Interference with other wireless devices, poor voice quality, viewing and deleting missed calls. Pros: Battery stand by time, voice mail settings. For its price, a much better quality is expected."
2,"not what ""Consumer Reports ""recomended","The first thing off is the ring tones...there is only two of them and they are both VERY ANNOYING!!!!! There seems to be a problem with the sensitivity to each of the phones to each other..can't explain exactly how but, in only that one will react, to the other when they are off the cradles ( as far as I can see...it happens all of the time,) but then there will be a pickup on the answering machine, that ends up with the "" I'm sorry,your call did not go through..please call back or dial your operator...BEE BEEBEBBBEBBPEEEPBEEPBEEEPBEPPBPE"" kind of thing...ALL OF THE TIME!!!!!!!! You get to hear all of this as loud as can be no matter what time of day or night. It is awful!!! The phone is difficult to understand in the many functions that are offered...it is not a good thing."
4,Great phone,I've been very happy so far with this phone. Sound is crystal clear without any interference.
5,Panasonic KX-TG1032S - Great Cordless Phone,"I've been very satisfied with the phone. Having two full-function handsets is great. We never realized how convenient it is to have caller id on all of our phones. I was also pleasantly surprised by the ability to share the phone directory (or not) between the two handsets. We've not experienced any of the sound volume fluctuations mentioned by other users of this phone. Lastly, the main phone base does have a flashing red light when there are new phonemail messages. So I'm not sure what some of the reviewers meant when they said that it was hard to tell when new messages arrived."
5,Best cordless phone ever,"Best phone out there, uses standard AAA Nimh batteries. Excellent sound and noise free operation. Have purchased 3 sets for friends."
1,"I'm tired of the ""No link to base"" error messages",What a total waste of money and time. This phone loses connection with its base even if the base is 12 inches from it. My set came with 3 phones. All 3 phones give me the same problem. Their connection with the bases seem to drift in and out. I've had many calls dropped because the phone just loses connection. What a terrible phone. I want my money back!
4,Panasonic Phone,"This is a great phone. Some reviews complain about the volume, but when the volume is set correctly on the phone, it's fine. I think some people don't bother to read the manual. A back lit keypad would be o.k., but I don't dial in the dark much anyway. Great range unless you expect it to pick up on the back 40. I also like the AAA rechargeable batteries. When they need replaced, you don't have to worry about trying to find special ones that only fit this phone. Has caller ID, large phonebook, speaker phone that works great too. If you are looking for a great basic phone, this one is it."
2,Won't answer!,"I bought this phone 5 months ago. This particular model of Panasonic is good in many ways. I can take it to the back of my garden, and it works great. Excellent reception when it works. However, sometimes when I pick up the phone when it rings, it's just dead. I have to re-plug it into the electrical outlet several times before it will work again. Digital phones all seem to have their little quirks."
2,Panasonic KX-TG1032S Dect 6.0 Phone,"Nice phone but lacks height of volume - after maxing the volume, it still does not compare to other phones."
1,Didn't work- returning to panasonic,Liked everything about the phone except for an important flaw. The voice volume would fad out- when I increased the volume using the control it would go up but quickly go back down again. Panasonic will honor a one year warranty and agreed to replace it since my 15 days to return to the seller was up.
1,Volume in earpiece drops intermittently,"After only the second time calling someone, their voice volume intermittently dropped so low on the phone (imagine trying to hear a mosquito's wing beat on the opposite side of a pane of glass) that I thought I had bumped a key with my face. Good to hear other reviewers had the same problem, as I still have enough time to return the phones to the store. Completely useless - the setup can't even operate as a phone with this problem - what a failure! Don't they test products anymore before selling them to the public?"
4,A very good phone overall,Needed to replace a previous dect phone for my home. Did some research and found out that this model recieved some of the best reviews. Works like a charm. I like the big buttons and feel of the whole phone. Battery life is good. Volume is good. Overall a very good phone.
4,"Works well, control a little awkward","The phone reception and the answering machine work great. The controls aren't super easy like some other phones. The biggest pain to me is that you have to push the button twice to get the caller id history to be displayed, which is annoying when I am in a hurry. Overall, the phone is great."
3,Panasonic DECT 6.0-Series Telephone Dual-Handset Cordless Phone System,"I initally thought the phone sounded terrific as it was suppose to offer a clear digital signal with no interferance from wireless routers, microwaves, etc. In all actuality the sound is very quiet. Turned all the way up it is hard to hear the conversation on the other end. Other than that it seems fine. I do believe I could have found a comparable phone for less money. The reason I did not return it is that it was a gift for my Father and he already has it hooked up."
3,This review is for Panasonic cordless phone KX-TG1032S,"I wanted to replace my old Uniden cordlessphone with a newer one and I chose Panasonic KX-TG1032SBut after I installed it, I was disappointed that theringer volume was so low, even at the highest setting. I could not hear it at about 20 feet away!I am hearing impaired I admit, but I think that Panasonic should consider older hard of hearing people too when they design phones.My old Uniden ringer was much louder and I could hear it in next room.So I returned the Panasonic and went back to my Uniden. Needless to say that I had to pay return postage."
3,phone system,"Originally, I liked this system. However, the volume is not adjustable and since I am hard of hearing, I can't use these phones. Also the answering machine no longer keeps the entire message. I often screen messages and then play them back and notice part of all messages is missing. I would not purchase again."
4,Very Satisfied,I have been using this system for a month and am quite pleased with it. It is easy to use and the instructions are clear. I really appreciate the battery life because my last Panasonic cordless system would hardly hold a charge before it finally bit the dust. The size of the handset is perfect for me and much better than my last cordless handset. I would definitely recommend this system for anyone who doesn't require lots of different functions beyond what this system delivers. I like the duel handset too. This system is quite nice.
2,PAnasonic DECT cordless Phone,"I purchased it for my 88 year old mother. It wasnt loud enough. When I purchased it, they said it was supposed tobe loud. Very disappointing"
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"The remote handset was defective (couldn't be heard by other party), and caused a lot of wasted time because I thought the problem was with the web based phone service I had just installed. When I finally deduced where the problem lye I went to the Panasonic site and was told to reset the handset by removing the batteries and reinstalling. Didn't work so now I have to pack up the phone, mail it postage paid to Texas and then who knows what. Hours of wasted time and frustration at the expense of poor craftsmanship."
1,Lasted only three months,"In less than one month, the phone had a ""continuous ring"" when a call came in -- it just kept ringing. About 8 weeks later a loud buzz developed on the line and the phone was unusable. I would not purchase again -- the phone was not like new."
4,great phone for the price,"Don't think you can beat this phone for the price. Have had multiple cordless phones in the past...mostly mediocre at best and am so happy to have one that is simple and comfortable to hold and use, has good sound quality, cool ringers and looks good. For 70 bucks, including 2 handsets...it's a steal."
4,Works fine,"Pros: 1) Great sound quality at both ends. 2) Good range -- we live in a large apartment and had no problem (but our walls are not concrete, that may be the problem experienced by some of the other users). 3) Great battery life. 4) Practical design.Cons: Sound on answer machine too low -- we are young with good hearing, still the message is okay/low. Bulky."
4,A top-notch cordless phone,"I did a great deal of online research on cordless phones after the new Vtech I picked up at Costco kept on dropping calls (unlike my ""ancient,"" heavy, two-line Vtech model used in a different part of the house).The Panasonic KX-TG1032S easy to use, easy to set up, has large numbers and letters in its display and, most important of all, has great sound quality. That high-quality is also evident when using the speakerphone, as I do frequently during business calls.One drawback is the alert for new messages -- not easily differentiating between old/new and quantity of messages -- and how they are erased. But that's a minor drawback to a top-notch phone. I only wish this technology had become available at a reasonable price for a two-line model."
5,unique recording of a rare work,"Brilliant singing throughout, especially by protagonist Nelly Miricioiu who enters new repertoire with great conviction. A steal! Great photos from the wonderful Rome production of this Opera."
3,womens PT cruiser bike,Bike came damaged in shipping. The fenders were smashed in and lots of scrapes on the paint job. The bike was supposed to have teal fenders to match the bike but received chrome fenders instead. The front tire rim is not straight and has a wobble.
3,Not much better than online help,"I ended up looking for another book after receiving this book. It didn't seem to answer any of the specific questions I had regarding Quick books - It seemed to be more of a hardcopy version of the help function online which was a big disappointment. I would look at the online help in the software and if it works for you, don't waste your money on this."
5,Invaluable Resource,"An invaluable resource for any business whouses Quick Books. Concise, well-organized and completeQuickBooks 2005 Bible is a resource we are already putting to great use in our business."
4,Reggae in America,"Although Carlos Jones was born in the United States and is not of Jamaican ancestry, his conversion to Rastafarianism and dedication to reggae music are genuine and deeply felt. Jones has long been a major figure in the reggae world in Cleveland, and this album is his latest contribution. Some of these tracks are renditions of songs by other artists, but many are his personal compositions. Highly recommended is his ""Torchbearer,"" a tribute to Bob Marley."
1,Doesn't work,"Doesn't work.. It's not liquid, look like a deodorant.. horrible to use! Better to buy a cream, I recommend clotrimazole."
4,Decent part,"I bought this part for my 03 dodge ram 4.7L. Part worked, but be advised that existing washer/spacer on your stock set up will have to be disgarded. No way that washer will fit due to the difference in the face of the pulleys from OEM to Gates."
2,WRONG PART,Despite stating it would fit my 2003 Lexus gx470 it would not fit. Mechanic said despite the manufacturer stating it was the correct part (he checked it out too) it was not the right part and he had to order the part listed for the 2002 Lexus gx470. So I don't know how to rate the quality of the part since I was not able to use it but they need to update their records to show that it doesn't fit 2003 Lexus.
3,I can't really rate this yet...Beware Vegans.....,I can't really rate this product yet so I'm giving it 3 stars just because I have to rate it.The one problem I have is that I am vegan and these pill has lactose in them.I really didn't realize this and now I have to find another form of natural pills for UTI.The worst part is I already took 1 without realizing... But It's only been a couple of months of being vegan so it's not terribly tragic for me.Disappointing though. So I guess I will save this for my non vegan husband. So now I have to search for vegan meds...Beware vegans...
4,Dated but still good,"The book only gets 4 stars because it's getting out of date. Nonetheless, if you can pick it up used for a few bucks, it's well worth the money and time, and the most interesting topics, like dance communication and hive behavior, are nicely covered. It's actually hard to find books like this. A book on honey bee biology is likely to be either too basic, perhaps intended for high school students, or too detailed, intended for others in the field. This book is just about right for the college/grad student or amateur biologist."
4,Great SOG knife: end to end impressions,"General: very appealing classic style.Blade: solid, thick stockEdge: pretty lame; in the past SOG knives came razor sharp (note: even the tiger shark I just got was dull - Taiwan manufacturing?)Sheath: A+ on the newer style. kydex > nylon.Handle: really comfortable compared to a seal pup glass/resin checkered grip. The cap is nicely finished with a cool looking end nut.For those concerned with disaster scenarios: I don't recommend bashing it with a ""baton"" (small log) to split fire wood. maybe just use an ax?"
5,Beautiful (dare I say sexy?) knife; great for camping.,"My usual camping/utility knife of choice is the Seal Pup Elite, but when I saw this come up for a steal from a seller here on Amazon, I decided to go for it. I'm glad I did.Handle has a softer feel to it than the GRN of the Seal Pup elite, but feels very grippy and as or more secure in your hand. Slightly larger blade is also good to baton larger diameter pieces of wood for campfires, though for shaving off pieces for kindling I find I prefer a smaller knife or even the blade of my hatchet.I have to say though, for sheer looks alone, this knife is hard to beat. Attractive design, with an overall presence that's large enough to carry a significant bada$$ factor and be good for close-in zombie combat, yet still not unwieldy to be useful for smaller jobs (to me a lot of the larger blades would seem to be only for zombies).In all a great addition to my camping gear. I won't leave home without it!"
1,wrong description,"When searching by ISBN 90-420-0161-5, results show ""Lautremond et Sand."" The correct title should be ""Albanische Etymologien."" Notice how the description of the book is in German but the title is in French. Amazon has linked the wrong title with author and ISBN. Buyers beware!"
2,Not his best work,"Overall the book is worth a read, if you want to read the whole Ethshire collection. But if you want to read a good story look at some of Watt-Evans other books. The story centers on a young man, going in search of his fortune, a tired old cliche, he runs across a young woman with wings who doesn't want to grow up and has the magic behind her to make it happen. He faces the problem of falling in love with the perpetual child as he himself grows up. Add to this situation an old man, magicly smitten with the adolescent angel. The best part is a cameo appearance of Valdar the innkeeper, from The Misenchanted Sword, a much better book."
5,DB 8 antenna,"An 8 'bow tie"" antenna. Easy to assemble and install. Excellent for being in a fringe area. Very nicely constructed. Thank you very much."
1,My Rabbit ears get more stations,I hooked up the new antena after assembeling it and to my surprise I recieved less channels than the set top style rabbit ears HDTV antenna I was trying to up grade. I live about 30 miles from from where the stations in my area broadcast from.
2,Anrennas Direct DB8 not for fringe areas,"This antenna is not for a fringe or deep fringe area, I only live 45 miles away from the transmitter in NYC, and I received only one station with half the signal than with my 15=year-old UHF/VHF antenna that has 30 elements for the UHF.I receive many channels in HD with my old antenna even if the signal is not strong with a signal strength of 50% to 65%, the highest I've got wit the DB8 was 24% on channel 5 (the only channel received)."
2,Very Disappointing,"Purchased the DB8 based on the reviews after our previous antenna came down in a storm. We live about 35 miles south east of Nashville and the UHF reception was only fair. Unfortunately, there were still a couple of stations remaining in the VHF range and this antenna does VERY poorly with VHF. As for being multi-directional... it wasn't. It was very sensitive to direction, much more so that a ""directional"" antenna such as the Winegard HD8200U.After six months, I finally tossed it and replaced it with a Winegard HD8200U. Should have purchased this antenna in the first place. The HD8200U has great reception for both UHF and VHF stations."
2,Not for all applications,"This antenna did not work well in my area, which is 50 miles from transmitters. I tried to replace a traditional multi-pole antenna with this hi-tech one in hopes of pulling in more HDTV channels but surprisingly while the traditional antenna could get 6 digital channels, this one could only get 4, with both antennas using a pre-amp and aimed in the identical direction. Both antennas were attic mounted but located in the same spot with identical wiring. Moving the DB8 around the attic did not help, nor did rotating it. The moral for me was this new type antenna may not work well in all locations. High marks, though, to Amazon for paying for return USPS shipping and full refund."
2,Look to Channel Master Antennas First Better Reception,"I was well pleased initially with this antenna as we live about 70 miles from Minneapolis. All of the channels came in EXCEPT channel 9 (KMSP). We needed 9 to get th FOX station, so I had out the local TV repair shop. The first and only thing he did was to install a Channel Master brand antenna, and instantly channel 9 came in. We also improved our channel 11 (NBC) signal strength, to where it no longer breaks up the signal. All of this, and the Channel Master antenna was only $100."
2,Disappointing Performance,"I purchased this antenna to replace an old attic mounted Radio Shack (Yagi style) antenna. Even with the assistance of Antennas Direct technical support, I was never able to receive even half the stations that my Radio Shack antenna pulled in. I ended up returning the DB8."
1,this is junk,i live in a real hilly area about 65 miles from the tv outlets.this db8 was the best on the market or so thay say.after about 3 days it would work on and off and never holds the stations i always hafto re scan and keep turning it.i do not recamend this antenna it is junk........
2,"yeah, right","after reading all the other reviews we decided to give this a try. We had lost all reception back in June when the switch to digetal was made. We live in an area that nobody will service since it is off road and quiet. Nothing worked so we felt we needed to go this route. We were real excited. Well, it wasn't worth it. The assembly was a bit confusing since it isn't written down but just in pictures and some of them we had to stare at to realize what went where. After it was all together we put it up and nothing, so we moved it--nothing, we did end up getting a rouge station here and there but usually lost it when we moved the antenna again and again. We pointed it east, south, north (we didn't try west since there is only water that way) and all combinations----nope, nada. So unless you are in a city or someplace where you are REAL confident of getting reception, don't bother with this one"
2,No VHF channels,I'm about 50 miles from the transimitting antennas in the Chicagoland area. The DB8 has a 15.8 dBi rating and I believe it has good gain for HDTV channels in the UHF spectrum but is inadequate for the channels that still occupy the VHF spectrum. Compared to a large Yagi from Radio Shack the DB8 falls short. The Yagi pulls in the VHF channels that the DB8 doesn't. Both antenna's are attic mounted and I believe my best chance for good reception would be to mount the Yagi outside. The VHF spectrum requires longer elements because the wavelength of the signal is longer than for UHF signals. In summary I don't recommend the DB8 for the Chicagoland area HDTV signals.Antennas Direct DB8 Multidirectional HDTV Antenna
2,Poor communication,"I tried calling antennas direct several times, only get voice mail. Sent several email questions regarding this product, with no response. Their tech support is a JOKE!!!"
1,Not if you have tall trees!,"We have purchased three digital antennas in the past two months and invested over $300.00 to get nothing! This particular antenna is worthless if you have tall trees. If the wind is blowing forget it! The information was not provided when we bought the antenna. It was not until we put the antenna up, and up some more, and then back down, that we went online and did some research. It is rated in the top 5 best IF there are no tall trees, four story buildings, towers or buildings to block the recepton. We are surrounded by 30 foot plus tall trees all the way around our property. DO NOT waste your money if you do not live on a prarie or someplace where trees are just not an issue. We are very disappointed. The indoor $89 rabbit ear digital box from Radio Shack works much, much better."
1,DOA - Wanted to like it,Nothing is more of a pain than having to take down an antenna you just put up. Defective unit that did nothing. I was replacing a recently purchased winegard (Winegard FreeVision FV-30BB HDTV Antenna) because I wanted something with a little better range. So I know the only variable is the antenna. Well who knows how well the DB8 is but I was sorely disappointed. Honestly if they have this bad of quality control I would hate to put the thing on my roof for I doubt it will hold up to the weather. Anyways wish I had more to say ... I was looking forward to finding a decent antenna ... guess I will have to look else where.
3,kinda pricy for what you get,"The Antennas Direct DB8 is a decent antenna. It was a bit cumbersome while tryingto assemble. I want to caution anyone while connecting the coaxial to the antenna: theflimsy circuit board inside will split and break with any twist. So be sure to onlyhand-tighten the coaxial cable and be careful the cable doesn't wrap around and causetension on the connector either! The signal strength for my area is poor. With the DB8I can go from 1-2 signal strength bars to a solid 5 (out of 5)! Not bad for what lookslike a fish-frying rack! So I can still recommend it, as customer service @(877) 825-5572was fast & friendly when I had a connector snap. They did not trouble me for a copy of mypurchase (or even ask how long I had had it)!"
1,expensive coat hanger,i bought this antenna to replace a uhf/vhf. even with a booster it worked no better. i rate it a zero. i am 50 miles from the transmitters and i onlygot two channels--same as old antenna. i hope i can get a refund. this is an expensive coat hanger!
5,Great Antenna,"Great antenna after setup. The setup instructions, particularly the illustrations, could have been better. After hookup to TV picked up 15. Not bad considering that I couldn't receive 6 of them on my old antenna. The furthest is 80 miles away and crystal clear, and this is with the antenna leaning against the wall in my living room in a house with metal siding. I can't wait to se what it will do outside without obstructions."
4,digital TV antenna review,"I received the antenna really quickly. My only complaint....the instructions were pretty vague....didn't even tell which side of the antenna was the ""front"". Otherwise---once I ""played"" with it, I decided it works pretty well. Where I used to get 3 analog channels, now I get 14 digital ones.Tom"
1,DB8 Antenna,"Antennas Direct DB8 Multidirectional HDTV AntennaThis product worked well after I repaired the module where it connects to the cable. At first the antenna was not working at all. After the unit was not working, I took off the plastic module (were the cable connects to the Antenna). I shook the module and there were loose parts inside. I re assembled it and the antenna worked well with an amplifier. I wrote and e-mail to the manufacturer asking for a new module (with no reply). Even though the antenna worked well after I fixed it. I would not recommend it because to manufacturer does not seem to support their product."
5,Thank you,"Thank you, Got the DB8 this evening,, easy to put together just looking at the details in the pictures on the box and in the instructions... Too late to put it up out side so I just hung it on my tv cabnet in a bed room that is on the side of the house that faces the direction I know the signal is coming from and yeah great solid signal even though it is inside the house. !!!! I am located on the very fringe of signal from the city north of us about 50 miles... So had wondered if we were going to be able find an antenna that would work for us and the DB8 is right on the mark.. I already had a (((( pre amp ))))) attached to my cable from a previous antenna we had tried that didn't work...So I am using the DB8 with a ((((seperately )))) purchased pre amp... Pleae make note of that when considering this antenna.... and be sure to consider the assessories for the DB8,So very happy can't wait to see what it does when placed outside.."
3,digital transmissions local area both uhf/vhf signal strength low,Assembly directions by photo copy picture of poor quality.Most transmitters in my area are about twenty to thirty miles. Majority of transmission antennas to my south a few to my north. The antenna very directionaland the signals came in very week without a signal gain amplifier.A traditional Channel Master antenna would have been the way to go.Not impressed gy the antenna.After talking to my local cable guy neighbor I'll swap out my coax for a newer one with better twist on connectors. This should make the coax more humidity & moisure proof. He told me here in Florida the moisture and condensation in the line can short out and deminish the signal. I'll give it a try.
5,Works as advertised,I bought this to replace a Mohu Leaf antenna. Installed it and it works great. The Television stations are about 25 miles away. No complaints.
2,Didn't work for me,"I'm 80 miles from Philadelphia and this only picked up 9 channels, i had this on the roof and still could pickup anymore channels. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO."
4,Good antenna but.......,"This is a great antenna to pick up those far away digital signals. However, don't be fooled it can only pick up UHF DTV signals. I unfortunatly have one VHF DTV signal in my spectrum. This antenna would not even touch it. I was picking up all UHF channels in my area some as far as 50 miles away without a problem, and that is with the antenna sitting at gound level. Imagine the possibilities with it up in the air. Overall it is a good antenna just beware of people saying it is a full spectrum HDTV antenna because it sure is not."
3,I would not call this multidirectional,"It works, but is not really muti-directional. I had to purchase a rotator which I could have done for my old UHF. In fact my old $25.00 may be better... I have yet to try it with the motorized rotator."
1,"Missing Part, Wrong Part","1. Product arrived open, bent, and dented. (shipper?)2. Rivet missing from 75 ohm transformer.3. Bow-tie standouts included 3 out of 4 proper bolts. One bolt far too short to fasten bow-ties, obviously wrong length compared to other three bolts.I was able to straighten bends and dents with my favorite hammer. Pliers helped too.HEADING OUT TO HARDWARE STORE TO FIND PROPER BOLT! WHEN I HAVE TO SPEND TIME CORRECTING OBVIOUS PRODUCT FLAWS, I AUTOMATICALLY GIVE LOWEST POSSIBLE SCORE.I purchase stuff online to avoid spending time running around to brick and mortar. I am now in the worst case scenario - buying online and running around burning time and dino sauce.Have not yet erected this antenna on the mast. Will rate reception when I get the product fixed."
2,its not that big deal,I though i will work much better then small indoor antenna the one i had before. but i didnt saw any different. its kind of wasting the money.
3,meh.,This was one of the top rated at the time. I live in the middle of nowhere and I still don’t get many stations. I haven’t watched NBC since TV went digital. Is Saturday night live still on?
1,NOT Multi Directional,"Also purchased The Pre-Amp and Amp from Antenna Direct factory. Doesn't work alone IS Not multi-directional as claimed, it must be pointed at the city or broadcast area desired. my disire was not to have to keep moving antenna, Failed.....As a stand alone, Failed...... needs an other antenna atached to the same pole."
2,not what i thought,the one i bought was used an it does not work like I thought we need a attenna guage we could buy too tell us if its working
3,Item is OK,Overall this is a pretty good antenna with the exception that is will not clear up VHF channels 3 & 9 other than that it is a decent item. It might be because they are about 65 miles away.
1,If they only shipped it on time . . . .,". . . I would have something to say about this antenna. After sending several inquiries and getting no response I tried to find out if this vendor was an actual company through Amazon and the manufacturer of the antenna and because of no reply to my eMails from the vendor and Amazon saw that I acted accordingly, they instituted their A-to-z Policy and I had a refund before the vendor got around to shipping. Don't buy from this vendor. Since it was finally shipped 20 days after it was due for initial delivery, I was told by Amazon to refuse the package of which I did through UPS and bought a Clearstream 2 (newly released from another vendor that had it in my hands before I could realize that had I even bought it). Now that will be a whole other review. The C2 comes from the same manufacturer as the DB8, Antennas Direct, I have had to talk to them and they are great! Look for my review on the C2."
1,P.O.S,"The specifications for this antenna states it will pull digital signals in with a 70 mile range. I installed this in a wooded area 40 miles away from Seattle. It does not recieve diddley. what is not mentioned is that UHF is line of sight, so it does not work for my application. I now have a $100 Roof Clothes Hangar. this Antenna may work wonderful in the big city"
1,Poor Assembly Instructions...Can't be put together!,"The antenna I received was a piece of crepe!1. The instructions are less than poor!2. Even being an Engineering Person, I shall visit mylocal hardware store tomorow because the pieces don'tfit. The holes for connecting the reflecors to theelements are distant from connecting, but a lower-downassembly piece makes this possible if longer bolts arepurchaced and the assembly instructions are thrown away."
1,Not worth 100+ USD,"Based on the reviews, I bought this one and can't return. I ended up buying another one from Best Buy, which pulls 5 more HD channels than this Terrestrial did, btw, the Terrestrial got ZERO and I am well within the range of distance from the towers for this Antenna.My suggestion is stay away from it"
3,DB8 Antenna,"I had read many, many reviews on this antenna which were quite positive, so I decided to give it a try. Assembling it wasn't too difficult, but the instructions weren't very good. I am about 34 miles from the ABC, NBC, and CBS towers in Seattle, WA. All three towers are on the same hill. The antenna ,with an amplifier, will pick up NBC perfect, but I cannot even get a signal on the other two. I also pick up other channels that are about 30 degrees offset from the major networks. So, the jury is still out whether this antenna is any good or maybe I may be in somewhat of ""black hole""."
5,HDTV DB8 Antenna,This antenna made it possible to receive television signals in our area. The product is great and the seller was prompt! Since it is multi directional we were able to fix it to the house and to get the direction around the trees to gain television signals.
4,Great reception locally,"Great reception localy. Will get a channel more than 75 miles away occassionally. I live out in the sticks. So this gave me local channels with 3-4 bars on a Samsung TV. I was getting 1-2 bars with a BD-2.I can get channels more than 75 miles away occassionaly with one bar. So its in and out.If you live out in the sticks like me you may want to invest in Winegard HD8200U Platinum Series High Definition VHF/UHF TV Antenna about $180. I only say this , because of the great reviews.I can't complain about this antenna.In the HD antenna world, the more you spend;the better reception and the bigger the antenna."
3,Good for UHF but not for VHF,"I bought this antenna thinking that all my local tv stations were going to switch to UHF frequency after they went digital--not so. One abc station remained on the VHF band after the digital switch, as a result, this antenna couldn't pick up the relatively distant VHF station.This antenna is best suited for the UHF band but if you have a VHF station fairly close then it may for the VHF station as well.Level of experience regarding item: moderate"
3,db8 antenna,Made some improvement over a Trerk HD out side antenna but still losing signal even with Motorola Signal Booster. Station towers are less then 20 miles away.
4,DB8 multi directional HDTV antenna,"The antenna works OK. Assembly was simple, appears well built however I was hoping with the items description that I would get better reception than the 20$ Radio Shack antenna I was using. I have a 50' run and it is mounted on the roof with a clear view to Seattle at about 13 miles and the reception is exactly the same.as my other antenna. Most channels come in but a few cut out frequently. Overall its OK, if you are attempting to upgrade yoiur current roof antenna I would say save your money as this is nothing special."
1,Disapointed....,"After spending all day trying to get a signal, I put my old antenna back up. My old antenna picked up more of both analog and digital than this antenna."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I bought this antenna when tv went HD. Combined it with a Motorola signal booster. We're about40 miles in a straight line from the broadcast towers. They're on one mountain and we're on another, so there's not much in the way. We couldn't receive any of the free channels. Had to go to cable. Perhaps if we were only ten miles from the broadcast antennas and there were no trees inbetween it would work. Or maybe if we raised it right next to a broadcast antenna. Returned this antenna, the mount and the booster."
3,if your old antenna is good keep it,Antennas Direct DB8 Multi-Directional Bowtie UHF Antenna with Extreme 70+ Miles RangeI BOUGHT THE DB8 THINKING I WAS GOING TO GET CLEARER STRONGER SIGNAL ....I WAS WRONG. MY OLD RADIO SHACK ANT WHICH WAS 30 YEARS OLD GOT CLEAR SIGNAL THOUGHT I COULD DO BETTER WITH THE DB8 . NOT SO. PUT IT UP SAME CHANNELS THEN I BOUGHT HIGH END CABLE. THEN I GOT GREAT PICTURES . IF YOUR GETTING SO SO PICTURES I WOULD START WITH THE CABLE. NOT THE ANTENNA. IF THE CABLE DOES NOT WORK THEN GO FOR A NEW ANTENNA.
3,It works!,"I took downs my old antenna - at least 20 years old and installed this new HD antenna. I also took off my old booster and added a need booster to match the antenna. Well guess what I wasted my money, I get the same reception and picture that I did before. Same channels are weak and the same channels are strong. Was easy to install and put together ans works."
1,poor response to question,I have wrote antennas direct about the db8 antenna not working and I have not recieved a response. I have a cheap yagi that picks up local channels 60 mi. away and this antenna will not even pick up a local channel 25 mi. away. I feel the antenna will never work when digital comes in either.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"Not very ""omni-directional"". Rated range is suspect. Mounting holes to assemble the antenna were not drilled out at Factory. Affected too much by weather. Over-all, a waste of my money. Stick with RCA ANT751R or Wingard HD7694 if you want a real antenna."
4,"At last, ....uninterupted viewing.","Upon delivery, I noticed that the box was damaged. A couple of holes in the corners exposed the parts inside but fortunately only a couple of fasteners were missing...I replaced them and added lockwashers to all the fasteners to reduce potential future problems. Assembly was simple. Installation of the unit was simple and easy. The reception is very good and even during rain/wind storms we maintain programing as if they we not occuring. An added sense of security has been provided because now we can watch the weather during the tornado warnings or other hazardous weather conditions...unlike our previous experiences with a different style digital antenna. Additional stations were not added but I believe they are not available in the direction we have the unit facing. All together, I am very pleased and recommend this type of antenna anyone."
4,Small but effective,Bought this one to replace large out dated antenna. This one is easy to assemble ( with only one phone call to customer service regarding change from picture on box and instructions) small and picks up from 60+ miles. Good buy.
4,"Works well, but need to be a rocket scientist to assemble","Once I got it set up, it pulled in stations 40 miles away on axis and 25 miles away off axis. The individual parts are flimsy, but the assembled and mounted unit is quite sturdy. Assembly was a big ordeal though. It came with the wrong instructions, probably for an earlier revision. There were enough differences that the instructions were completely useless. Even the parts list was wrong. I compared the parts to the list and thought I was missing some pieces. If you are lacking in assembly intuition or do not understand how multi-element antenna circuits should be wired, you may want some assembly assistance. Also, you will need to buy a long antenna mast. The piece that runs vertically through the antenna from bottom to top is not included and a standard dish mount is not nearly long enough."
4,DB8 DTV antenna,"The DB8 DTV antenna has been installed temporarily on my original rotator for my old analog antenna in my attic. I am just 48 miles from Phila. and Baltimore TV stations, (midway). With a DTV converter box and a signal amplifier on the antenna, I get about 4 or 5 digital channels very nicely, (not enough). The obvious next step is to put the antenna outdoors on a tall mast, which will be done when the weather warms up. The DB8 antenna works fairly well for the analog channels as well. For DTV it must be rotated rather precisely to find the setting for each individual channel, i.e. it has a very narrow angular focus. Seems to me it would always demand a rotator mount to be useful where we are located. Doubtless, everything will improve when it is mounted up high, outdoors. The ads implied this antenna it would have a broad, multi-directional effectiveness, definitely not so in my setup, without rotating."
3,"Location, location","I purchased two of these antennas, and installed them approximately 700 feet apart. One works great, and the other, not so much."
3,Good but not great,We were able to get some digit channels with this antenna but not as many as I had hoped.
3,direct d88 multidirecttional antenna,"The antenna only worked fair i live about fourty miles away from 2 tv prodcast cities.I could only get 4 out of about 10 stations from one city and 1 of 4 stations from the other on a 20 foot pole.Reinstalled my old radio shack antenna and got more stations than the d88.giving it 3 stars is iffy.Maybe if i had a larger tv tower it might work better i don,t know."
4,DB8 Antenna,Very fast shipping. Arrived in good shape. I have not used this item yet however I am impressed with the construction.
4,Better than to big one,"We had a big old fashioned antenna that came down in a wind storm (I don't remember what it was but it was the biggest and best Radio Shack sold 3 years ago). I couldn't believe this little thing would work as well as the old one, but it actually works better and was SO much easier to put up. We are about 70 miles from the nearest stations and this usually picks up both. They are in seperate towns, so we have to aim it between them and sometimes lose one or the other. If it is directly at the station, it works all the time. This does not seam to catch the wind nearly as bad as the old antenna and is much more stable so should last longer. For the price, I would buy this again, but it would be nicer if it was more multidirectional (although it might not pick up the signals if it was...)."
2,DId not work for me,"In my situation, about 60 mi line of sight from the transmitter and a big tree in front of my house, this antenna did not work. I understand that this is not a VHF antenna, however, some VHF channels were pulled in while others in the UHF band were not.A Winegard 7697P did the trick. It is a much bigger and more expensive antenna, so you may still want to try the DB8 first."
4,Great Antenna.,Áfter installing this antenna I have been able watch TV without having to go to set up mode every so often like I did with the old antenna. Once I got the antenna faceing the right direction I have been able to watch 5 channels with no trouble at all. Installation was fairly easy..
5,IMPRESSIVE,"Arrived in two days. Package in good condition and No missing parts. It was easy to assemble and took about 20 min.Performance is excellent. I live 54 miles from the transmitters and have to receive the signals through acres of trees,most notably Douglas Fir. I even pick up two stations 53 miles away in the opposite directions.I have about 100 ft run of coax and installed the RCA pre-amp sold here on Amazon. I suggest this as a must for transmitters far off and long coax runs.This low profile antenna is just great,I was dubious when I first saw the box size,thinking I had made a mistake in buying it. But am completely satisfied and may buy another to mount on same pole,but in the direction of the city to the south.Well worth a try. Plus it does not have those long elements like the yogi style antennas that bend and break due to branches flying off trees when the wind kicks up."
1,"Promises much, but delivers nothing.","Living in a fringe area and to date relying on a set top antenna to pull in a few stations, I decided to purchase the DB8 for better reception in anticipation of the changeover to digital. I based my decision on previous reviews and specs.The results? Worse reception of the single station we pull in clearly with the set top antenna, and marginally better reception of two other stations - still grainy and noisy, however.What a waste of money. I definitely do not recommend the DB8."
1,Prepare to be disappointed,"It is advertised as multi-directional. The antenna pictured is, the current design is not.The quality just is not there - for the price, I expected a lot better. The transformer looks like a piece of junk, the weather boot does not fit, and the holes do not line up during assembly.Reception is no better than antennas half the size and a third the price."
1,Poorer Reception Than Old Indoor Antenna,"I set this up outside to replace an older indoor antenna that could not be rotated. This antenna did not receive UHF channels that the old antenna did receive. In addition, part of the antenna was poking out of the package, a small part was missing and the antenna was not as pictured in the directions. I returned it. Thanks to Amazon for accepting it back and crediting my account."
3,"Good, but no better than the Clearstream 4 antenna","I bought this antenna to see if it would pull in more channels (multi-directional) than the 23 clear crisp channels I was receiving on the Clearstream 4 antenna by the same company. It made no difference whatsoever and since the Clearstream 4 is smaller, more compact and better looking, I decided to keep the Clearstream 4."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"GREAT Antenna - poor instructions - Pictures on instructions did not match antenna - - guy at Factory was VERY HELPFUL though.Shipping was not the greatest - box came OPEN when arrived, and a couple of washers were missing."
2,michblue,Did not work as advertised. I am getting better HDTV with my 20 year old roof antenna. Ireturnd the product.
5,antennas direct db8 hdtv antenna,"The antenna worked great here in the mountains before the trees leafed out. The antenna still works good but I will have to trim a few trees to get a better signal. Out of the box the picture on the box was worth a thousand words. The instructions tended to be a little confusing, so I relied a lot on the picture. Assembly took about 30 minutes. The antenna has very little tolerance in asthmuth. You can miss the signal if you miss just a couple of degrees. All in all this is probably as good a hdtv antenna as you could buy."
5,Zephyrhills Area Very Good Reception,"I Just replaced a combo VHF/UHF with the DB8. It works very well and some of the stations are more than 50 miles away. Without turning it with the attached rotor, I now receive 24 stations with 100% signal on most and not less than 89% on a few. It was very easy to install and I am not using a booster. Recommended."
4,DB8 Multidirectional HDTV Antenna,"I have replaced my old vhf/uhf antenna with this one, I'm about 75 miles from transmitters and presently receive most of our channels, I found that this antenna is very directional so you must use a rotor. The signals are very week during the day but early morning and evening they are not to bad, hopefully my signal strength will improve when I put it on a 50 ft mast. Unfortunately we have 1 digital station on channel 10 which is vhf and need another antenna to receive it."
3,Clogs Easily,"I bought 2 of these. One for a 20 gallon long goldfish tank to help filter along with a UV submersible filter. The second I have used as a supplemental filter for a 30 gallon turtle tub alongside a few other pumps/filters. Both of them clogged after a few days and weren't moving water anymore. The filter media I was originally using was the foam that comes with it. I took those out and added carbon that was large enough to not escape the baskets. That solved the problem! I would not order this as a primary filter, but for some supplemental cleaning or water agitation, I would recommend this."
1,Ask yourself this....,"Before you take a chance on ""Day of the Ax"" ask yourself this:Do you like bad dialogue?Do you like bad acting?Do you like bad pacing?Do you like a bad script?Do you like retarded villians?Do you like wasting your time?Do you like wasting your money?If you answered yes to the majority of those questions than this is the movie for you..."
4,entertaining indie horror flick,"I recommend taking a chance on this indie horror film. It's not a Hollywood film, but hey, sometimes that's why we like indie films, isn't it? It's fun to watch, raw and rugged and has its own unique style. It's clearly inspired by ""Texas Chainsaw"" but has it's own wacky plot filled with entertaining and whimsical characters who are shall we say, just a little bit ""different"". Watch the movie - you'll see what I mean. Awesome performance by Tina Krause too. Filled with lots of action, violence and gore though - so this movie is not for the faint of heart."
4,Great for those already introduced to EVA,"Readers looking to expand their understanding beyond the ideas in books like Valuation, Creating Shareholder Value, Quest For Value, etc should have this in the library. The collection provides great brain food for advanced corp fin ideas/debates for both securities analysts and corporations. The downside would be that application of some of the ideas presented would a bit difficult for an analyst (vs a company insider)."
4,"""A Great Moral""","The vibrant pictures caught Parish and Isaac's eyes. Isaac made the noises for the animals. They enjoyed the ""action"" of the illustrations.The moral is great. Sometimes, it is an internal characteristic that makes us special. In this case, it was bravery.It is well-written, well-illustrated. It is perfect for pre-schoolers. It is a great way to teach children about character."
5,awesome fo ranyone who knows a disabled teen,"Without pity or pathetic descriptions, a story is told of two dynamite kids - neither of whom are able to speak out loud. Mr. Perske portrays his friends with warmth and caring and tells of an adventure endearing for anyone to read. I have a non-verbal son who enjoyed this thoroughly and have recommended it to everyone I come in conctact with who knows a disabled teen. Wish he would write another !"
5,Informative and well organized,"This book has become one of my most used resources. If you are looking for a way to use WMI and WBEM to inexpensively manage a Windows environment, this is it.This book will guide you through the steps to understand and maximize the capabilities of WMI, which IS FREE.It's really a minimal cost when you consider that it opens up an understanding that could possibly alleviate the need for one or two of your third party management products (which are costing you a fortune).Anyway, I really enjoyed it. I have been waiting for some more information than is offered on the MSFT site, and this book gave me what I needed, and more..."
3,Good book but lots of errors,"This is a good book to get you started on understanding WMI. However, the book has many errors in it's code. It can be frustrating if your new to scripting and WMI. Unfortunatley, it's the only book in the market right now so if your looking to learn WMI, go for it."
5,Script Coding is now Available,"I just came from ""samspublishing.com"" and noticed so many complaints about their being no ""code samples."" Well you all can just pop over to samspublishing.com and then use ""Marcin Policht"" in the search box to find this book. Once you are at this book's page you can see a link for ""Related Materials"" and it is there that you will find a small download ""code.zip"" to apease those who need the code samples.I put a 5 star rating here only to offset those that said they would give it a 5 if it had the coding samples. I have not read this book and was concerned about the negative remarks. I don't need the code samples, but found it difficult to not mention that they are indeed available for download."
2,Too many elaborate samples,"This clown doesn't know how to teach.SOrry, but i don't know what on earth book the other reviewers were reading but it wasn't this one.This guy will come up with the most ridiculously elaborate code to illustrate the simplest tasks. It takes three hours to read through all the code to figure out what he is trying to do, and COULD do in 1/10th the code he writes.Its nice to see you can get complex and structured, but when you are writing a book to TEACH..you need to keep the samples simple.This clown gets two stars."
5,Made me hungry!,"I caught the video (which is included) and couldn't stop laughing. It's a sugary, but makes ya feel good like of song."
1,"Really, I don't even give it one star!","This album by the Fast Food Rockers, is probably terrible. I haven't even heard it but I know they're bad. I don't think I need to listen to it! They're supposed to be a band for children, yet they dance around in tight PVC costumes - which is not an image to encourage kids to do. If your looking for decent music choose Busted (or Darius - for Stephanie!) They rock! Oh and hey to everyone in 11F at Newstead! Big Up to Madame Howarth!"
4,Good sounding speakers.,They sound fine! Good highs... almost too much for me! The bass is a little distorted when pushed but I don't mind that. I don't usually turn them up that loud anyway... I don't need or want the windows shaking. They fit right in my 1993 Ford Ranger... I bought 4. They are worth the money but they are not under valued. Price is about right at $30 and under... But if you are going to run an amp with them I don't know what they will sound like. My after market stereo puts out 40 amps per ch. and that is all they need! I installed them with insulation and plastic sheeting behind them. That cleared up the bass a little when they are turned up. But they work fine for a 48 yr old guy listening to Queen! LOL!
4,nice,easy install. clean sound. good cost effective replacement sound system. Will continue to purchace Pyle products. Thanks again for another quality product
3,Not too bad,"They are good for my expedition, I can't have my system cause of my kids but they do enough for me. There at a good price and hook up is simple."
3,car stereo speakers,"Sound quality is avg, used in a topless jeep so high fidelity not a priority for me.Excellent value for this application."
5,Poems - mostly about Indian women - that tell little stories,"This is the kind of collection that will turn poetry haters into poetry lovers (or at least poetry likers). Divakaruni tells moving little stories -- rather than addressing abstract ideas -- in these entertaining poems. My favorites were ""Woman With Kite"" and ""The Makers of Chili Paste."" Her poems are mostly about Indian women, though I found them universally moving"
1,Purveyor of the fictional exotic to the pseudo intellectuals,"Ms. Divakaruni's output is likely to be forgotten in a short time -perhaps a few years. In the mean time, she masquerades as an interpreter of the east to the sort-of-educated white audience. Along with her fellow Bengali woman author, Bharati Mukherjee, this lady continues the insults of Sikhs, this time from Yuba City. Perhaps this attitude is rooted in their upbringing in Calcutta, where Sikhs drove Taxi Cabs, buses, and trucks and (like another minority group in the US) were blessed with legendary equipment - in stark contrast to their own bengali men - who though so intellectual just did not have this physical dimension."
5,Baklava as good as home made,"The city I live in has a vibrant Greek community. This baklava is as good as much of what I have tasted locally. It is better than any other ""store baught"" I've ever had!"
1,yuch!,"This product is just awful. It tastes as if it was made with shortening instead butter. And, it is as dry as the Sahara and as sweet as standing water. Cardboard comes to mind. I ate a few pieces and tossed the rest. I guess I'll need to wait for the local Greek festival to get something decent."
2,Doesn't taste like authentic Greek Baklava,"I just spent time in Greece last month, one of many places I visited along the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. I was also in the Middle East (Israel). And I can tell you, this does NOT even compare to the real stuff.This Baklava is very, very dry and very conservative on the quantity and quality of ingredients. It lacks flavor big time! And the pieces are so small they are bite size. The nuts are minced so fine you can't even tell they are nuts. Instead it's like a dry, pasty filling with little flavor.In Greece, the pieces are large (huge compared to what you get with this), overflowing with the moist, nutty filling, very flavorful, with lots of honey, spices, and phyllo. I had Baklava purchased at a bakery on Patmos Island, Greece that blows this Baklava out of the water by far.I won't be buying from here again. I'll keep looking elsewhere.I gave two stars for packaging and speed. If I only had to rate the product itself, it would've gotten zero stars."
3,1 + 1 + 1 only equals 3,"When I think of the Rat Pack, I think of the chemistry that happened between the members that made thier joint collaborations special (in live shows as well as their famous after-hours adventures). As a collective unit together they were greater than the sum of the individual parts.This 3 CD set is a collection of three individual CDs outlining the individual careers of Frank, Dino and Sammy. As the CDs focus on the individual, rather than collaborative careers of these talented individuals it's an interesting collection, but does not represent 3 CDs of collaborative Rat Pack magic.A fine package of vintage footage associated with these three very talented individuals, but - just as a collection of 4 solo albums (one from John, one from George, one from Paul and one from Ringo) would never represent a Beatle album - I'm not sure this package truly represents the real Rat Pack magic."
5,Fantastic Scissors,"These are great scissors, not only for in home tasks but also great in the garden and work bench. As a senior with arthritis issues in both hands and shoulders, their pop-up style has allowed me the freedom to do tasks minus the pain I would have had from regular scissors. As a serious gardener, I can honestly say they are the best dead-heading tool I've found, plus trimming of stems and branches much larger then you would think possible with scissors. At this point I buy them 2 at a time because my husband enjoys them as much as I do ... oh, and the reason we tend to purchase them once a year is because our in home pair has been used for some out door chore you would never expect to use them for ... unless you've owned them."
2,DOESN'T STAY LOCKED,"the scissors work well but the do not stay locked at all, open up as soon as you set the lock on them, so that leaves the blades open all the time and not safe."
3,Used to love my Fiskars shears...,"I have found most Fiskar shears to be of good quality over the years... and I loved this specific model for quite a while. I do a fair amount of cutting and the spring action etc. is all the good things that others have already mentioned. Eventually, (before the scissors had been used extensively) - the spring popped out. It looked okay - but did not work well on reinsertion. Without the spring action - the scissors are no longer easy to use. I think I only need a new spring - but haven't figured out where to get one yet. If anyone has easy info about that - I'd appreciate it."
2,Huge disappointment!,"These scissors worked great for the first week for cutting fabric. However, the scissors now get stuck whenever I cut down all the way. I can kind of work around the problem by doing small cuts and not cutting down all the way, but it is very annoying. Overall, I'm very disappointed, and I thought it would work well for longer than a week."
4,Nice Scissors,"These are great, well designed scissors that are very easy to use. It took me a while to get used to using them, but now I am very happy with them."
2,beware,"This product appeared sturdy, however I returned it since the fine print at the back of the package indicated that it is made out of a plastic known to cause cancer and genetic defects. Beware!"
5,essential for anyone who does a lot of cutting,The spring action is a real hand-saver. I occasionally have carpel tunnel syndrome and joint pain. These scissors are the easiest cutting tool I have ever used. They make regular scissors seem old fashioned.
5,Love them!,This is the second set of these wonderful scissors that I've bought. I have one in the kitchen and one on the office. I have arthritis and these scissors are a great. They have a spring action that opens them after cutting. A big help during Christmas for cutting the wrapping paper and doing crafts. 5 big stars.
5,"Great for arthritis, whether Osteo or Rheumatoid Arthritis","I bought this product because I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and my hands can no longer handle using regular scissors, not even the larger, soft handle kind. These are a dream to use...they spring open gently and have a great, easy to use grip which doesn't put strain on your fingers. I find the button on the side easy to use to lock and unlock. The only thing I noticed was that the scissors don't open up fully, so if you want a long cut, you have to pull them open a bit more yourself. I tend to use for crafts, so I don't do that much but I did want to mention it. They might open up more with time as the spring gets a little looser. Great product, great price!"
5,scissors,good product-it helps because i have arthritis and can't use regular scissors-these take considerable strain off my hands-i recommend them for anyone with arthritic hands
2,Orange blade lock breaks easily,"Although I still use these the orange blade lock broke in two and was impossible to repair very shortly after purchase (days), so now the scissors constantly want to stay open. I did not abuse or force the blade lock, nor did I drop the scissors."
5,This is an excellent book,"This book is simply complete, adequate, and extremely well written concerning the subject of neurobiology. An updated version is eagerly awaited."
5,Liquor and Laughter,"I thought the record was hilarious. Not in a B.J. Pruett kind of way, but hilarious nonetheless. Perfect for long trips in the car. It has a PARENTAL ADVISORY for some language so it's probably not something that I'd recommend for kids, but it's nothing they haven't heard. It also comes with a free DVD of Wix doing an irreverant Smothers Bros type comedy with the guitar player from Montgomery Gentry. If you're a Montgomery Gentry fan you'll love it, as there is about 10 minutes dedicated to them. I've heard him on XM comedy as well."
3,The title is the best thing about this CD,"Loved the title. But the rest of the CD is pretty much standard humor for this day. It's not really humor as much as it is commentary about young mod life today. It's supposed to be funny, and some of it is. But it's mostly standard humor outlooks that some people think is funny."
2,If you have to have a barbie,"I'm vigorously against barbie dolls and any that are given to my children will be disappeared, but I bought this for a transracially adopted child who had been given 20 blonde barbies for her birthday and none that looked like her. Her mother wasn't going to disappear the horrid things, so I figured she at least needed one that looked like her. While it is supposed to be Spanish, it looks rather Romani, which is what I was shooting for. Photo is accurate."
2,No idea.,Liked the other travel books by Nat Geo Directions. Couldn't tell what this one was about. Interesting subject to look up in a different book.
1,"Dont even think about it, total waste of time","I was given this book by my daughter in law who was fooled as I was by the cover and the title, and the reference to National Geo. I have a home in the caribbean and so the subject is of great interest to me.It took me 25 or so pages to find that the book was anything but useful to anyone wanting to know about Martinique. In a word its ""awful"" a farce a sham,poorly written and I agree completely with the other 2 reviews. Do not waste your money.Had my well meaning daughter in law read these reviews she would never have purchased the book.Austin"
4,Terrific visual imagery...,"Ordered this by mistake... and love it! These songs - some bluegrass, some folk - really paint pictures for me when I listen. I love the songs about the mom & daughter dancing, the ""midnight flight,"" and the ""old folks."" The instruments are all acoustic, the guy can really sing, and the flute player's incredible!!!"
2,not a great quality,"The handguards do not fit, so you cannot use them. The ornament on the grip immediately fell apart. The thickness between the two are different."
2,Very Disappointed,"I ""ordered"" two natural wooden bokken. I RECEIVED two red wood bokken with wrapped grips. This not what I ordered. I was very disappointed when opening the box and saw this. I know that after about an hour of working out with a wrapped handle it starts coming off. They were not the expected curved bokken but two strait swords. Who ever is filling the order needs to pay attention to what is being ordered or there will be alot more dissatisfied customers."
1,true review,this sword or known as katana is the worst i have trained with many swords but this sad excuse of a sword can only be played by a child it broke when it was the smacked by a soft punching bag worst thing ever do not fall for his tricks the shipping is the worst then any other shipping in the world it broke really fast i dint even smack it that hard plzzz im for the sake of your good dont buy this pathetic sword
2,BAD PRICE FOR SHIPPING!,"Ok, i didn't even buy the product, but the shipping is 10$!! Your not getting 2 for 1, your paying the same price!"
3,Either a shipping mixup or missadvertised,"I got two bokkens, and this is what i noted about them1. They both had cord wrapped handles unlike the ones in the picture, and the cord wasn't secured all that well and moved after the first couple of swings, so i removed it and scraped the glue off the bottom side of the handle - this took too long but it was worth it.2. One of them wasn't of solid wood construction, it was spliced with another piece of wood at the handle about 3 inches at the end, so its not all that critical but still something to mention.Other than that the weight is pretty good and they seem to be quite sturdy and fit for practice."
2,Beware!!! Mold may be present!!!!!!,"We bought these for my 6 year old ninja in training. They arrived on time. They come shrink wrapped in a heavy plastic. The one sword was perfect. The other sword was not. While I was getting ready to remove the plastic I could see alot of black bumps on the sword. Upon removing the plastic I figuered out what those black bumps were. MOLD!!!! There was mold growing on the sword. There were chips in the blade area and cracks all along the handel. I could have washed and wiped the mold off and dealt with that if the sword was for me, but I'm not giving that to my son. That sword found a nice home in our outdoor fireplace that night and was burned."
2,not as great as expected,"the bokken were a gift to my boyfriend. They were the weight and length of actual samurai swords, which was good, but they came with woven grips that I did not ask for. The color was also NOT what it appears. Rather than being the dark cherry color advertised, it was light with patches of dark and green-very nonuniform. The hilts are also nonexistent-they simply didn't have them. I was disappointed with the look of them to be honest-not what was advertised. After the first sparring session, the grip (that was not expected in the first place) began to unravel. Also, the bokken have already began to get serious dents and scratches only after a few uses. This is a great TOY, but a serious sparrer may want to go elsewhere or purchase something without grips."
1,Memorex CD/DVD OPTIDISC worthless,"It says ""put in drive, press play"". Well in my old panasonic DVD and my new Toshiba DVD play/write I got the error message that it couldnt be read, please eject. So no idea how these are supposed to work."
1,Save your money`,"No difference whatsoever after using. My advice......Purchase a good can of air and blow out your cd, dvd, or game console. The only cleaner I have used that made a notable difference, had an alcohol applicator (wet cleaning), but I can not recall the brand of find it any longer."
3,"So far, so good","This was a support purchase for a VIP in our organization. I've not heard back one way or another. So, it may be safe to assume that their DVD player is still intact."
2,Cleaning your DVD Player Laser Head Instructions,"Hi,I created a document that covers these topics for a DVD player I have.[...]Basic OutlineIssues that will be addressed:I. DVD1. DVD not burning.2. DVD not playing3. DVD not FinalizingII. DVD Player1. DVD tray will not come out2. DVD player displays the word ""Super""III. Other1. Reset the DVD Player2. Preventive Measure for future DVD issues3. Firmware Update"
1,Laser lens cleaner,This product did nothing for my problem. I think I'll need to buy a new DVD reader/burner. I'm not even sure what my problem is - the DVD reader is taking 4-5 times longer to read a DVD than it did when I purchased it 6-8 months ago.
3,Disappointed,"I think Amazon has an obligation to let buyers know this book is self-published. It's a reader-beware kind of thing. I was disappointed after spending nearly $30 to find something with so much clumsy writing, grammatical and punctuational errors, misspelled words, blurry photos with misplaced captions, and just plain poor editorial quality.This does not take away from what the Marines did. I was a grunt myself (0331, M-60 machine-gunner) for 7 years at the end of Vietnam. I have also been in the publishing business for 20 years, so I know what I'm talking about. I always become uneasy about the facts presented in a book when so little care has been spent on the little things. Faithful in the little things, faithful in the big things--and vice versa."
2,Disappointed,"This book was very disappointing to me. As a Marine who fought in the battle of Narsiryah I was anxious to have the story come out. Livingston, however, does a poor job of telling it. Thanks to his personal interviews he does a pretty good job with the facts. Unfortunatly his mechanics and style are atrocious. There is a mispelling on the jacket of my edition and countless other gramatical mistakes inside. The descriptions of the barve men and women that fought that day are lacking. The reader doesn't learn much about the Marines, other than where they went to High School and what they want to do when they get out. His credibility is challenged further by the use of military and Marine terminology that he obviously does not understand. The novel seems rushed and there are entirely to many mistakes. The Marines of Task Force Tarawa deserve better."
4,Author of book,"To say I didn't interview the Marines who I list in the book is an insult to those young men who fought and died for those key bridges. To suggest that the Marines I talked to didn't relate the truth is just ridiculous. Their stories corraborate one another. The quotes used are woven into the story and are all listed in the sources in the back of the book. Yes there are some unanswered questions from the battle and probably may never be answered. Some facts have just been released concerning the friendly fire incident of the A-10. Attack the writing, or style but please do not attack the Marines who shared their stories through me. caissonpress@yahoo.com"
2,Not what it seems,"My family was very interested in this book as my brother-in-law was a Marine killed on the 23rd. As we have later found out, some of the interviews never took place and quotes are used from people who were not interviewed. Sadly, I am not sure if we or any other families will ever get an accurate accounting of what took place that day. I know of Marines that were there that have thrown this book in the trash. Read it carefully and take what it says with a grain of salt."
2,"Good Intentions, Incomplete Story","This book is an attempt to tell the story of An Nasiriyah on March 23, 2003. It seems this book offers a rehash of newspaper and television stories, with a handful of new interviews. These new interviews seem to drive the narrative thread, rather than getting interviews to get the full story. This subject deserves to be covered, but with the research to tell the whole story."
3,"Great ideas, messy implementation","My 4.5yo and 2yo daughters love this book and are always asking me to draw designs on them. The only thing I don't like about it is that, unlike conventional face paint, the designs do not dry on the skin. They can rub off at any point... and the colors stain, black especially. :("
5,Carlsson Rosin,I've played and taught double bass for many years. I've tried most every rosin out there. Carlsson Bass Rosin tops my list. It holds up well in all weather conditions and gives just the right grip in my opinion. Glad I found it from Hoffman Strings LTD on Amazon.
3,Great for starters...but needs a bit more meat,"Baldyga Dan's book is a great place to start as one embarks on the journey of auto insurance hell. it's a simple read and easy to follow. The author makes use of a formula called the ""BASE"" to put a general value of a claim. While this general method for determining valuation is a good start, what the book really needs are specific examples of ""Demand Letters"" or ""How to put together a really good claims letter to justify the settlement that you've requested"". Lawyers charge excessive fee's. The online version of this book is $20. You do the math...."
3,Some good information.,"This book was easy to read and had some useful information in it. Two things this book was missing: 1) Example letters. 2) Book was focused on small claims (under 10,000). It also assumed that Premium was the largest claim amount you could get -- didn't take into account long term problems, etc.If you are wanting help with an auto claim, I would also get ""How to Win Your Personal Injury Claim"" which is a NOLO book written by an attorney.Together, these two books will give you a lot of information."
1,Not enough substance to be serious,"I've read three books on this subject and this is so far below the quality of the other books that I'd say withoutt hesitation that it is a waste of money. It totals about 100 pages and there is much repetition to get it to that point. I'd suggest looking at ""How to Win Your Personal Injury Claim"" which is a NOLO book written by an attorney. The substance of the book is substantial and doesn't take the other book's simplistic approach to judging the value of the claim. Importantly, there are a significant number of cases shown that will provide benchmarks to real settlements. Benchmarks are very important and it is really hard to get them if you aren't in the business. I would like to see more benchmark cases even in the book I prefer."
4,Excellent source of information; buy it !,"I was in an accident and I bought Dan Baldyga's excellent book; I got a tremndous return on this purchase! The insurance people wanted to low-ball me; Baldyga's book taught me to hang in there for more cash, which I did. This book is easy to read and understand. He was an adjuster so he knows the game from the insurance perspective very well. I gave this book to my brother who is trying to settle his own claim; he got a bigger offer from the insurance company thanks to this great book."
2,A little disappointed.,"After reading the unsuitable wife , I bought Unsuitable husband. The unsuitable wife was clean cut and more interesting. I think we should know if the book has R rated parts in it. I usually stop reading at those point of the book but decided to see how much of the book was like that. I can't believe either that she was that naive . I like to read for pure joy. Not a prude, but choose to read clean cut romance. To each there own. Just want to know ahead of time."
2,Problematic,In my point of view it's impossible to like the story when you dislike the main characters and that was the problem - I didn't enjoy the main characters.The heroine is very silly and nave while the hero is a thief and a tramp (like the title says he IS unsuitable).
2,"Poor writing, terrible characters, cliche plot = BAD NOVEL","I bought this book based upon the other reviews and am now wondering if we were reading the same book. This book was awful. The heroine was your typically really dumb virgin (BORING) who was so good and kind that she adopted children from the streets. The hero was your typical rake with a tortured past. You probably can figure out where the story goes from here. One final note, the author has this annoying habit of sprinkling the phrase ""Um"" throughout her dialogue. I advise a more judicious use of the phrase, because it became very annoying! If you are looking for a good western romance, try Jodi Thomas or Alexis Harrington instead."
4,The Most Unsuitable Husband,"Enjoyed story line, the sex really had nothing to do about story and could have been kept to a line or two."
1,worse than trash,"i bought some of these for potentially cooling some home audio components in a rack system, assuming the Compaq name would offer some insurance against them being garbage. oops.1. the blades are cloth about as thick as a sheet of paper2. effective wind range on this is about 6""3. the weight of the head unit is such that is slowly falls down/over without support when running - it's not staying anywhere without tape!4. this has the worst noise-to-wind ratio i've ever experienced - the motor is stupidly loud5. the fan head transfers serious vibrations all the way down the shaft into your USB port and/or computer. it would probably be a better massager than a fan, in terms of transferred vibration.6. the copyright on the instructions is 2003, and there is no notation of watts/amps used7. i wouldn't trust this plugged into any computer or other valuable electronics."
2,Two stars only because of the pictures...,"So you think you're a knock-knock joke fan?Well, then I strongly suggest that you don't buy this book because it will ruin your taste for jokes the very minute you open it.I've got nothing bad to say about the pictures, which in fact are quite good.However, the jokes themselves are all ones I've heard before, and most of them are so stupid that there's absolutely nothing funny about them. It's also not nice that the author copies someone else's jokes and puts them in a book titled as her own.Take some good advice, and don't waste your money on this book unless you've got nothing better to do with it. If you're really desperate for knock knock jokes, your money would be better spent on books by David Lewman, Joanna Cole, or Tad Hills."
3,good ideas for Astral and Dream Worlds; a few good baddies,"Having been a Palladium gamer for over 10 years, but having not played in the last 3, I have been looking at the new books to find new material to start a new campaign.I like this book for its ideas about the Astral Plane and Dreamworlds. Some of the ideas about how players can adventure in these realms is interesting. The RCCs and baddies for each realm are imaginative and are integral to the style of the realms themselves, so the author should be commended.Caveat: I haven't played this system yet, so my recommendation should be taken with a grain of salt.However, I like the direction of the book and think any serious Palladium (Heroes, Ninjas, Nightbane) GM would probably find this interesting and useful, particularly the new rules on Astral Magic."
3,Twisted worlds for twisted people,"A sourcebook for the apparently defunct Palladium game, Nightspawn, Between the Shadows adds new characters and villains/monsters to the already frightening world of Nightspawn.The one main drawback to Between the Shadows is that it is confusing for someone with little knowledge of the Nightspawn game and how it interacts with things like the Dreamstream (a sort of plane/amalgam of dreams).Even so, this is an excellent add-on to Nightspawn.(NOTE: Astute readers of this review will note that I am calling this game NightSPAWN, not NightBANE. Nightspawn was the original title; Todd McFarlane, puffed up little poser that he is, apparently thought people would confuse his comic book with this game and threatened to sue.)"
3,What Dreams My Come.,"Between The Shadows is a good addition to the twisted and strange world of Nightbane. With added monsters and other oddities this books is a good addition to the Nightbane world. It adds an entirely new look to the astral plane, and those that live and walk within it."
5,Grip like no other,Where ever you need to have traction/safety this type of adhesive tape is a must. Easily trimmed to size too. Looks like it will last for a while.
4,Should work very well on wood but not grout,"I returned this item. But I can't give it a bad review just because it doesn't work on grout. I didn't open it, it was my neighbor who suggested that *maybe* it won't work on grout. So instead of opening it up and not working and then unable to return it, I just returned it.I'm sure it will work great on wood, terracotta, etc. But I doubt it will work on unsmooth surfaces such as grout. Our brick steps are filled with grout in between so we didn't even want to take the chance and use these in case it rains and washes it all away anyway.I must say, the price is half than what my local hardware store sells it for."
5,Works as advertised,Fixed a friends ladder steps to prevent a fall.I am sure that I will think of other uses for it.
1,Fell off in Rain,I live in Seattle and the poor tape just couldn't take the rain. Took the time and effort for prep and apply it correctly. Put it on the wooden porch stairs leading up to my house to help my older dog get up and down without slipping - we loved it for about two days - and then it all came right off. I really wanted it to work. I'll have to find another solution ASAP.
5,use this on my computer to minimize slips,"I use this for an unusual purpose - put it on the edges of my laptop, front and back, as a non-slip surface. Since doing this, ""almost dropped it"" moments have gone to zero.Given the cost of a good laptop, this is a great solution - OK, so it's not visually appealing, but as the new Madonna song says, ""I don't give a..."" (LOL).It's great stuff!"
2,Would not recommend.,Glue does not hold after rain. The glue is not sufficient on outside steps in shady area. Failed despite detailed surface prep. Do not recommend.
5,Now that's a sticky situation!,"I added this to a steep wooden ramp that's prone to getting wet. So far, it's worked great and has maintained well.I did staple it in place. I'm not sure how well the glue would have held on its own, but I wasn't going to take any chances."
3,Great for beginners...not so for intermediate...still good,"The Shimmy Shimmy Drop Drop DVD was a well put together video that is instructional and precise for the student or Dancer looking for Beginner instruction. Although I found that the combos and layers were ""too easy"" for my learning level and needs this video should be added to any teachers inventory for their students to learn from.The added ""performance"" of the moves was an added bonus...to see the combos and layers in full movement and placed to music was outstanding.I rated this a 3 because I believe all dvds should have a learning level of easy to hard, I realize not all can be judged by one person, but it would be easier to find what you are exactly looking for in an instructional dvd and know that you will be getting what you desire. For now this dvd will sit on my shelf in my Bellydance library, waiting for a day that a new student wishes to expand their practice at home."
4,Insightful....,I watched the dvd and it's very helpful if you want to add new techniques. I like the way they categorize each technique and they break it down step by step and has a performance at the end of every technique.
3,Good game. Could have been better.,"This game has almost everything except for the one thing that would have made me buy it: multiplayer. According to the official Xbox site, we were expecting a two-player cooperative mode. It wasn't until the game had been released for a week before Xbox noticed and corrected their site. Mind you, there are great graphics and character models/animations. The game play moves fairly quickly. The real problem here was boasting what we didn't get."
2,Just Plain Uninteresting,"Hearing the praise heaped upon this title in the gamingpress convinced me to go out and buy a title. I wasvery disappointed.The various quests in the game all feel the same: killa bunch of orcs, fight a big boss.The graphics are impressive, but no more so than any othermajor XBOX title.The game is LOADED with cutscenes from the first twoLotR movies. They add a little something to the game,but only the first time you watch them. And that's theproblem -- its difficult if not impossible to stop themonce they've started! You have to set through the entirething every time you replay a mission. Yawn.I won't call this a bad game, not compared to some of theabysmal heaps of festering parrot droppings I've playedin over twenty years of video gaming. But this could havebeen far better."
1,Five Stars for Frustration,I deeply regret purchasing The Two Towers based on people's good reviews. Will never trust the reviewers again. Taught me a good lesson that I should always rent the game to check it out beforehand rather than blindly going by what majority of the reviewers said. I played less than a full 30 minutes of the game before I gave up on it. Nice graphics and great sound but frustratingly limiting and absolutely no incentive for me to get to the next level.
1,Awful,"One of the worst games I've ever played. It's less of a game really than just thinly-veiled ""movie marketing"". Anyone who is fooled by this over-priced advertisment deserves to have their $ taken from them. Rent it and see for yourself, but please don't buy it. Save your money for something less exploitive and more fun. There are dozens of better choices out there."
2,frustrating game,I do not like this game witch i feal is to frustating and no fun.(1)you have to buy combos.(2)the orc archers can get anoying.(3)if you get into a big fight like 1 on 4 you lose half your health treing to kill just 1 of them.(4)the clips from the movies make me feel like i was playing a 1990's game.
1,Not involved at all,This game has no story at all. If the movie wasn't so good no one would ever buy the game. What about the exciting three customizable characters you say? They are basicly the exact same. The moves you can buy for each one are the same just with different names. The game is almost too easy. It took all of 3 or 4 hours of game play to beat the main story line and the secret level. It also gets very repetive. Every level is the same fight except for the background.
1,Did not enjot it,"I'm not fond of video games that are fashioned after movies/books. It takes away from the mystery that video games otherwise offer. The thrill of not knowing what is going to happen and what you are going to meet next isn't fullfilled. The outline is already mapped out and the suprise factor is gone. LOTR Two Towers feels like the game has too much control over me. There are too many cut scenes that you can't button through (can be frustrating).I didn't give the game a chance to play repeatedly so I may have missed out on some important things (like how to skip the cut scenes) but I found the game play boring. If you're into pure hack and slash then this is the game for you. I found it pretty bland.On a brighter side, the game looks and sounds decent."
2,great for a while,This is one of those you watch the movie and your ready to play a lord of the rings game but after the sheer novelty wears off it becomes verry repetative and it's soo short Iwould not reccomend this game.
3,Close But No Cigar,"Could have been one of the best...Had they not stolen controlfrom the gamer.Don't time me and don't ever force me to go theway you want me to go.Cut scenes are way too many and it's ba-sically a rail shooter.The fighting moves are good but not evenclose to Enclave.Next time,EA,get the **** out of my way andallow me the time and freedom to wander.Also way too short.Youcan easily beat this game in one or two days.Was also let downwhen they left out the demon down in the mines of Moria.No youcouldn't beat him,but it would have been nice to get chased outof the mines by him."
4,The Two Towers,"This is 1 of the best darn games out there. The graphics are something that you would expect from x-box[meaning astounding].The gameplay is unbeatable because of the swell moves, great levels, and the way u can relate it to the movie. Every now and then there is a cut scene directly from yhe movie.The 1 problem with the game is that it is to short. U can beat the game with 1 person in about 4-7 hours of playing.U buy moves at the end of each level depending on your level and expierence points. This is a good game."
3,little or no replay value,"Great graphics. Elements from both movies, game starts at the beginning of the trilogy (the Fellowship) and ends at the end of the Two Towers. Very short game includes special features. Great for people that dont spend very much time playing video games, little or no replay value. 12 levels plus four survival levels you can play the game as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and you can earn and play through the game as Isildur."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this game used for under ten bucks...thankfully. It is basically mortal kombat with movie cutscenes, too many movie cutscences. The sound and graphics are decent, but I was hoping for an RPG game not a mortal kombat fight game. If you like the mortal kombat style fight games, then this game is for you..if not, avoid it like the plague. Oh and by the way, the camera in this game is alomost as bad as silent hill 2."
4,not as fun as it looks but a good way to pass time,"I'm not a huge or even a big fan of the Lord of the rings. I only watched the movies and played this game and thats it.These game whin it starts dosen't strat at the 2 towers but at the followship. you spend the first 5 levels in the 1st movie then the last 5 levels in the two towers. The graphics aren't that bad the stroy is not there you just go everwhere and in no peticular place. When your fighting there could be 5 to 1, and you have to buy upgrades for new moves and weapons. Thats no fun I'd reather earn them, and when your at helm's deep the part two and three had nothing to do with the movie. If you want to play a good good 3rd person view game like this one don't play this."
2,Disappointed,"I guess I made the mistake of not reading the table of contents before buying. I just got my copy and started looking for performance tips and hacks. Can't find any. In fact, there aren't many ""hacks"" at all. Mostly tips and instructions on how to do stuff. For example, running 'dmesg' from the terminal doesn't seem to me to be a hack.Mac OS X has a bsd subsystem and a unix-like kernel. Certainly, there are things one can do to optimize these, but this book doensn't even attemp to assist.Joe"
2,not for the experienced Unix user/admin,"I would not have used the word 'Hacks' in this title as the content is really more like tips for the unix novice. If you know what 'ls -al | wc -l' does and don't think that installing mysql is a hack then don't bother buying this book. I was expecting far more advanced hacking and found the purchase very disappointing, but beginners will probably gush over it."
1,A review reader,"I am sure the book is good but was it necessary for the author to give himself so many reviews. Check all the review for this author. Just who is ""a reader"" They say self praise stinks Right?"
4,Simple but Clean and Crisp,"Writing was not the best but I enjoyed this story by a fellow Marine and praise him fr sitting down and knocking out this story of combat, something I hope to do in the future. Nice job mixing intr-unit relations with external threats."
3,bought as a gift,I bought this book as a gift for my husband. He has read it and said it was OK. It was a little difficult to read because it would jump from present day to the past.
1,Looking for an Interesting Trivia Calendar? Look Elsewhere!,"Sure, there are occasional interesting facts on this calendar, but mainly it's ""true or false"" statements relating to obscure entertainment facts or genuinely uninteresting things. For example: [Former President Bill Clinton is a Fan of the Card Game Bridge]. Now, is there a remotely interesting answer to that question? Or a couple of recent ones: [The First Star Trek Episode Featured a Mind-Reading Alien -- Crap]. A Star Trek fan knows it's wrong; a non-Star Trek fan doesn't give a damn! Or: [Fantasy Island is a Small Spot on an Island in the South Pacific -- Crap, Fantasy Island is fictional]. No kidding! How many Rhodes scholars contributed to that one? Find some other trivia calendar. This is SO lame."
3,It's Funny - That's a FACT,"After receiving the boxed game of Fact or Crap as a gift, this calendar made a great companion."
4,Introduction to the Darkchild Trilogy,"What happens when a boy who is not quite what he seems meets a girl who will not stay as she is? A boy is sent to study the seemingly primitive Brakrathi planet and the rulers of that planet need to decide if he is friend or foe.Van Scyoc's novel _Sunwaifs_ was long one of my favorite science fiction novels, but I had not read anything else that she had written. Darkchild is clearly imagined and strongly written and an encouragement to read the rest of the series."
4,One of the best fantasy roleplaying games available today.,"The Palladium Fantasy Roleplaying Game is rich with excellent graphics. Unlike most fantasy roleplaying games, the player is not limited to only a few races. The rulebook does not describe the world in any detail, which is a minus (They appear in separate worldbooks). However all the Gods and religions are described instead."
1,Don't play it,"All right, I have been a GM/DM for 20 years and I have never seen a more unbalanced RPG out there. IT seems like the designer made his game like this:""OK what's the HP of the dragon, well lets put a bunch of possible values in a hat and draw one out!"" Draws. ""Look the mook has 1 billion hp, sounds right to me. Print it!"" And then this ""The dragon has a breath weapon, hmmmm say 1d4-4dmg!!!! That's correct"" It's really that bad folks. This thing can utterly destroy you as a DM\GM, run, run far away and never return!"
1,welcome to the world of RIFTS Jr.,"This product doesnt even feel like a Fantasy game anymore. It will be a favorite among munchkins everywhere... the first edition was much better, and this could have been so much more..."
3,"Fine, not great","I am a long-time D&D; player, but one of my friends decided he wanted to run a game of Palladium. Now, if you are a d20 gamer, STAY AWAY. You will be confused, bemused, and befuddled. If you are a Call of Cthulu veteran, however, you will be familiar with the d% based skills. The rules have not been updated for many years, so these are the rules to get if you want to play.All in all, not a bad system, but not as good as D&D; or GURPS. There are lots of additional books to expand your library, but unless you have something against other systems, I recommend this one as more of a novelty than a primary system.The binding of the book is the weird laminated paperback cover, and peels fairly easily, as well as retaining creases very prominantly. It will not stay nice for long, so don't bother ordering a pristine one, unless you are very OCD about it (I am, and ordered a ""Like New"" one)"
4,noteworthy,"This is the movie that destroyed Linda McInerney's career. But still she's really beautiful, and her love scenes in this are actually gorgeous.And you will ask ""who is Linda McInerney?"" Exactly."
4,There Good for listening not for Bumping! lol,"These speakers are on the the high treble end. They become distorted on bass filled songs.If you just listen to your music, they are great. If you want to bump your music than you will need to add a sub to them to get bass. They lack bass. Great speakers though for the regular ear."
4,Great Speakers For The Money,"I'm always a little recluctant to buy cheap speakers, but since these were going in a Jeep..and the chances of them getting ripped off is more than average, figured I wouldn't be out much. I've had Pyle speakers before, and these are just as good as the name behind them. For being small, the bass response is surprisingly strong. The highs don't sound ""tinny"" either. They're mounted in small speaker boxes and sound great. All the hardware is included, plus standard wire that you may want to upgrade to get the best out of them. The only reason they didn't rate a 5 was that I had a little problem getting the grills to stay on the speakers once they were mounted in the box. Overall, very happy and definately a great value."
5,Fabulous!,"Excellent orchestrations. The chamber setting emphasizes the vocal demands placed on the singers.The vocal casting is superb. Honest voices singing honest roles.This combination affords the listener the chance to enjoy this opera as it is intended. The opera is often described as unlistenable, mostly due to the over production of sound. ""The Tender Land"" was never intended to sound Wagnerian."
1,Sick of it!!!!,"I am getting sick of the fat chick acceptance thing. No doubt some fat people can be healthy. And some marathonners can smoke cigarettes. Lets say smoking is OK. Hell, I have seen some really fit junkies. Does it make heroin OK. Quit trying to teach my kids bad habbits can find some window of acceptance."
5,Awesome spirit-lifting Christian songs,These are kinds of songs to listen to when you'd like to express your love to your sweetheart or while meditating about love and your spirit needs a bit of lift up click.
1,Don't Bother,"Nothing happened in the first 300 pages. How many ways can you write that Felecia couldn't fall in love with Rory because their families were in a fued. Likewise, Rory couldn't love Felecia because he was afraid to lose a 3rd wife. They hardly even conversed - I couldn't understand how they developed fellings for one another. Felicia had so much character but she never used it until the last 50 pages. The book had potential but Patricia must have been on a tight schedule. The editing was horrible also. Don't bother with this one."
5,A fun romp..,"This was a great start to her Beloved series. The story is believable, the characters are real and the conflict is the strongest element in the enjoyment of this book and series. Ms Potter knows how to tug on the heart strings of her readers and provides them with a tale that is rich in conflict and adventure. This may be the first of the trilogy ( Beloved Stranger, and Beloved Warrior) but she sets a tone that will be hard to improve on and yet she does with a deft hand. For those readers who love their Scottish romances set in the highlands with enough love and intrigue, one shouldn't miss this first one in her Beloved trilogy."
1,Inferior Workmanship,Talk about lack of attention to detail! Very amateurish & poor glazing job as was the case with similar items by Boston Warehouse. Definitely pass this one up.
4,The Best of Rob Bingham Is This Book,I dont know why Gerry was raving about Lightning on the Sun but this collection of short stories is much better. It came first too.I remember Rob Bingham giving me a pre-print corner-store bound copy with a cheap plastic cover for me to preview in 1997. I rolled my eyes and thought: here goes another Salinger wannabe. I read it and it turned out to be unpretentious. I liked Bad Stars a lot. It spoke to me with a bit of John Irving in it for flavor. It wasn't bad. In fact it was good for a first try.He had misadventures in Cambodia enough to be a small time Tim Page and semi-real William Burroughs but he was just too young and too privilaged to know true desperation. I miss the guy and this is his best work. Can't say the same for what followed.
5,Family Guy for all seasons,Great collection it's really great to watch as how the voices and animation progresses from season 1 to the current season. Always as funny and never a let down.
5,Comedy at its best!,"I'm not really the animation type. I usually prefer The Sopranos or something of the like. However, my fiance loves this show and got me into it. I must say that it is now one of my favorite shows. If you like pure comedy, this is for you. My fiance is going to be happily suprised when he opens this up on Christmas!"
3,Just OK,"Sorry to say that this material isn't for me. The writing and humor felt really dated even though it only goes back to the 1970's. Still, this is a lovingly compiled collection of Wilson's series that was featured in 'National Lampoon' and fans of this strip will appreciate the beautiful construction of this compilation."
2,Not Good Key Action,"First, the good:* all the keys are full-sized - none of those pipsqueak arrow keys* the function keys have not been remapped to different default actions (gimme back my function keys, Microsoft!)* almost all keys are in the places they should beThe not-so-good:There are Wake, Sleep, and Power keys in the space normally occupied by Scroll Lock and Co., which have been moved down into where one expects to find Insert, Home, and Page Up. Basically everything above the arrow keys has been moved down one row, which causes me to frequenly hit the wrong key.The worst thing about it, though, is that the keys are difficult to depress. They take a little extra force than that to which I am accustomed, which puts extra strain on my wrists. This defeats the purpose of buying an ergonomic keyboard."
2,Great idea; Weak hook,"I love the design of this and was happy to take it to Europe. The first time I used it, the hook broke. Great idea; cheap materials. Enough said. :)"
1,Easily breaks,The cheap plastic hooks have no resiliency. One of the snapped the first time it was depressed. Would not recommend.
5,Clever and useful,This worked in every hotel room and cruise ship room. Allowed me to pack light and rinse out clothing instead of hauling it with me. Right up until I left it in a room last summer. I was really sad to lose it and will order another.
2,Plastic carabiners at end of rope a problem for me,"Coghlans Pegless Bungee Clothesline - Coghlans 0433 purchased from AmazonThis travel clothes line has two plastic clips at the end that are designed to work like a carabiner.The first time I tried pushing on the (supposedly) flexible part, it snapped right off.The other clip could be fully depressed.I am returning it and looking for an alternative."
2,Not so much,"This item disappointed me. It was far bulkier than I expected. The cord is very thick (as in little-finger thick), but this might be useful for someone who wants to hang extremely heavy items up to dry, such as down comforters or giant medieval tapestries. The little parts of the clips that close after you click the clips onto something broke immediately. This did not prevent me from clipping it up, but I got the ""inferior product"" vibe here."
5,Blast From the Past,I love this CD! I listened to it as a child and memorized some of the songs. I have never forgotten them and I sang them to my own children when they were young. Kids love the silly verses and the fun music.
4,Almost made me want to go out and get married!,"I was interested in making veils after I made one for my neice's Halloween costume. I really liked this book.She starts out with your work area, and goes on to cover every type of veil imaginable. Hats, combs, headbands, headpieces, poufs--a sewing extravaganza. She covers materials, embellishments and edgings. She also does bridesmaid's and flower girl headpieces and covers how to attach the veil to your head so it won't slide off, and how to store it afterward.The only thing that holds this book back from a 5-star rating is her lack of yardages, a rather major flaw. She may occasionally say, ""Take an 8-18 inch wide piece of illusion from 54-72 inches long,"" but this is way too general. She also doesn't say how many yards of material to purchase!"
4,Very Helpful and Informative Indeed!!,"This is a terrific way for brides-to-be, to save themselves money and add that extra special touch to their very special day! The drawings are truly wonderful and very helpful, even if you are not a very crafty person. Even after my own wedding, I have made 2 more veils for friends who have gotten married, and this was my wedding present to them. This added that extra personal touch! I recommend this for all brides. Enjoy this one, it's great!!"
2,Needs more photo's,I didn't like the book and returned it. There are no color photos in the book all black and white and very wordy. If you are a crafty person who likes lots of text descriptions it is probably a good book but if you like photos to follow it is not for you.
3,ALERT!,"Didn't really want to rate this since it will not work with my ProPlus 2.1. Let me say that again, because if you have the Proplus 2.1 rather than the Proplus 2 (the two models are almost identical and have the same functions--only difference is one has two metal buttons). I never dreamed that a "".1"" on the end of the product name would require a completely different PC cable. At 89 bucks a shot that is an expensive oversight, especially after throwing out all the packaging. Bottom line, just thought I would alert the consumer because the different cable requirement is not highlighted by most retailers."
3,Works OK but why so expensive?,Does the job as described but I bet production cost was less than 1/10 the price. It's just a USB cable. I wouldn't have purchased it except that you can't update the dive computer firmware without it.
4,Oceanic USB Cable,"I have a Veo 200. After getting past the quirks of set up, the cable worked as expected. You did have to make sure the contacts were properly aligned - since they moved without very much effort. Then it was a little confusing to follow the set up (as it's written for several models). Once you got past the quirks it was great, but because of the set backs I gave it 4 stars."
5,LOVE THAT CD,"I BOUGHT THE CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND AT FIRST I ONLY LISTNED TO THE FIRST SIDE, ESPECILLY POWER BELONGS TO GOD, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAN AS BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE OTHERS, THEY BEGAN TO MINISTER TO MY HEART THE WAY THE FIRST SONG DID. I AGREE WITH SOME WHO SAY THIS IS A DIFFERENT VIBE FOR PASTOR WALKER, BUT FROM WHAT I GATHER HE'S TRYING TO REACH EVER BODY WITH THIS PROJECT. EVERY SONG MAY NOT APPEAL TO EVERYBODY BUT EVERYONE WILL GET SOMTHING FROM EVERY SONG. GOD USED HIM MIGHTLY ON THIS PROJECT. WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO SOMEONE? YES. YOUNG AND OLD."
1,Save your money,"I like most fans of Rev. Walker look forward to his new cd's. This cd is a major disappointment. The music is not up to par with his earlier works. Many of the songs don't even sound like he had anything to do with them. If I there was any way I could get my money back, I would definitely return this cd. Do yourself a favor, listen to his earlier works and pass on this one."
2,A Disappointed Fan,"Every year I look forward to buying a CD from Hezekiah Walker and the Love Fellowship Choir. I have follow their music from the beginning and have all their tapes and CD's. The music is always inspiring and uplifting to the soul and I admire the choir for representing that. Unfortunately, this year I am disappointed in the type of influences that are on this CD. Only the first seven songs on it are worth listening to, they resemble the songs of the past. The other seven songs don't even sound like LFC. I didn't even like the CD cover. There is too much hip hop and rap influence in this album,(Let's Dance,Give'em Your Life,Finally) which isn't uplifting at all. I think that Hezekiah has allowed others to influence his direction on this particular CD. I would not recommend it to any of my friends or family. I did not get my money's worth this time. Hopefully next year will be better."
1,Hezekiah Walker & Love Fellows,I recieved the CD in atimely mannor. But the CD was scratched mid way through the last of the 4 to 6 songs I am not able to enjoy it is going to cost me more to buy an CD REPAIR KIT then what i paid for the CD shipping and handling. I COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT NEW. RALEIGH NC
2,A Big let-down,"I grew up listening to Hezekiah Walker and he has always been one of my favorite gospel artists. So, when I heard that Hez was coming out with a new album, I rushed to get it. When I heard the entire album, I was sorely disappointed. The writing was really poor. The songs on Live in Atlanta and Live in New York (By Any Means Necessary) were much better written. The songs on Family Affair are Mickey Mouse songs with only a chorus and a drive. It was almost as bad as the LFT album. A few years ago, there was a rumor that the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir was going to stop recording. After losing a lot of their good band members and obviously some of their best writers, maybe they do need to hang up the hat."
5,Hanaukyo Maid Team,"boy loses family, moves to rich grandfathers house where he finds that he is now the head of the family and has an army of maid that will serve his every whim. and then his life gets wierder... great potential and good story."
3,A Boy and his Maids,"This is your basic shonen manga. As was said in the previous review, a middle-school aged kid moves into the mansion his grandfather left him in his will, and when he gets there he finds it's full of maids... young, beautiful maids who all wish to serve him as best they can in any and every way possible. Unfortunately, our hero has some strange, fairly strong alergic reactions to women (with one exception). He, with tons of scantily clad girls around, is put into all kinds of awkward predicaments. Everyday situations are complicated, and antics necessarily ensue."
4,It's just like playing a movie!,"I have jealously played this game on a friends PS 2 and when I found out about the GC version I was really pleased. This is the closest any game has ever come to making you feel like you are ""playing the movie""."
3,Too much fighting not enough adventure.,"I am giving this review 3 stars because I like the extra interview features and the fact this game has so many elements of the movies such as the voice actors, movie clips, scenery from the movies etc. It's being in middle earth which is really cool.What I don't like is that this game just drops you from one major battle to the next with little adventuring. There are so many monsters to hit eventually you're just pressing buttons and it's hard even on the very easy setting.Without cheat codes I wouldn't be able to make it through the levels.What I like about reading the books of the Lord of the Rings is the adventuring and the fatastic enchanted places and peoples. That seems to be lost on these game developers. They focus only on the fighting. What a pity.How about a real role playing game set in middle earth? The game should be 80% adventuring and 20% fighting."
4,good but wayyyyy too dark!!!!,"and i don't mean ""dark"" by being violent i mean too dark as in it was completely black and the person i was fighting as ran into a something slashing and bashing and making sarcastistic remarks and then for some reason i got a game over.i slashed,crashed and smashed my way for about oh say 3 minutes!! then i was stabbed from behind because the guy was saying something like ""i'll make soup out of you yet!!!"". *sigh* oh well it was still fun at least i didn't see blood."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER ON EARTH,YOU MUST GET YHIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS FUN. IT MAY BE EASY BUT IT IS ALWAYS VERY VERY FUN. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS VERY VERY FUN VIDEO GAME. GRAPHICS DON'T MATTER WHEN YOU ARE HAVING LOTS OF FUN.I THINK HAVING FUN IS MORE INPORTANT THAN GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT PEOPLE JUDGE A GAME BY. A GAME IS MADE TO HAVE LOTS OF FUN.
1,Ah Lord of the Rings......you just didn't have it this time.,"how could u? i had high aspects of this game. you disappointed me like u disappointed the fans everywhere. chad, do not buy this game. oh i'm so angry i could eat dirt. the graphics were as bad as sega genesis. please take this advice. the levels in the game are so easy to beat. i just got gamecube 3 days ago. i feel so ashamed. please forgive me gary."
5,Awesome Game,this game is so much fun. this is a great game. i thought that the graphics were awesome in this version of the two towers. this game is fun and enjoyable to play. if you have not played this game then i recommend that you do
5,"The Ultimate Battle Game, By J Johonsen.","Ok, if you liked the LOTR Movies, you will love this game. Numerous combos with aragorn, gimli and Legolas make each character different and fun to batle with. While gimli is a slow tank, Legolas is quick and agile in batle. the differences between characters allow for advantages on each level. so what if it's all battling, WHAT""S BETTER??For all extreme gamers, I strongly suggest this game"
4,Ruthless Roaring Ring Rumpus,"This game has several notable positive aspects:-You can complete the game without worrying much about ""combination"" attacks. On the other hand, you are rated on style for each mission. If you want to achieve the highest ratings, you need to use a variety of attacks, making use of the combos.-The feel of the game is very similar to the movie, perhaps mostly due to the great soundtrack.-Especially by the end of the game, there are just tons of enemies to kill at once. As unrealistic as that might seem, it mirrors the movie perfectly.The one negative of this game is that it should be multiplayer. I'm not accusing the developer of making an oversight, since adding this feature is obviously complicated. However, many of the missions are played alongside computer-controlled Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli. It's hard not to wonder how much more fun the game would be if you had a friend controlling one of them."
5,it is the best game ever!!!,"The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is the best game!!! You can beAragorn, Legolas, or Gimli. Each of them have there own special abilities. Like for instance aragorn can use a sword or a bow n arrow. Legolas uses two daggers and a bow n arrow. Finally, Gimli can use an axe and a throwing axe. In the lord of the rings the two towers, u fight a variety of orcs, trolls, saruman, and other kind of Saurons minions. You can play levels such as helms deep, the mines of moria, and many other locations. the graphics are so real! in the game they show clips from the new movie of lord of the rings and u cant even tell if u are watchin the movie still or if it is time to play the game. I cant wait until it finally comes out. so i think that u should consider buying the lord of the rings the two towers for nintendo gamecube."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this game. The only thing to do is constantly beat up on bad guys... there's no plot, other than being locked into the movie plot, and the gameplay is monotonous and extremely unoriginal. You can't even make use of the environment around you. You're locked into moving through the game in exactly one way, with no interaction with other characters.Further, the camera angles are extremely frustrating and make gameplay difficult in many instances, especially if you're using a bow. There is virtually no aiming with the bow... either you're pointed roughly in the right direction and you hit things or you're not and your arrows fly off to nowhere.The Lord of the Rings setting doesn't redeem this at all. I loved the movies and I love the books, but this game is missing everything that makes them great.Now to figure out how/where to sell my copy..."
5,Lord Of The Rings Two Towers Rocks BABY!!!!!,"I loved this game so much. I am doing best with Gimli. Iam getting the game for NGC early, but i've played it on ps2. The beginning level with the last allinance of men and elves is amazing.Son Check it out!!!Oh yeah, Go gamecube."
3,"Cool Extras, Mediocre Game","LOTR-2 Towers is definitely fun for me as a fan of the movies, however as a game it leaves alot to be desired. The unlockable interviews and behind the scenes stuff is great. It is also totally cool that they used the real actors from the movie to do the voices. However the game itself was quite a let down, the combo's turn into button mashing pretty quickly and the game IS TOO SHORT! You will probably finish within a few hours with any experience at gaming. Definitely a great rental but not really worth buyng."
4,Becoming Santa,"This is a great movie for getting into the Christmas spirit. If you are thinking about becoming one of Santa's helpers, this movie will be perfect."
1,My eyes are bleeding...,"My poor children have lost their faith in Santa. Please save yours. Gift wrapped and sold just like any other Christmas commodity, this film feels just like Walmart stocking the shelves in August. I hate my freedom."
5,Delightful documentary about becoming Santa,"After losing both of his parents, Jack tries to rediscover the spirit of Christmas by becoming a Santa Claus. Middle-aged and having no family of his own, Jack's journey to become one of the most identifiable and loved icons in the world leads him beyond the ""ho, ho, ho"" to the hope that Christmas offers.As well as following Jack as he becomes Santa, this film also spends some time show us the history of Santa Claus.A delightful and touching film. Goes great with cookies and a glass of milk."
3,Faulty Decision ruins it,"I have to agree with another review who stated that the biggest issue with this DVD is the narration and the judging in the ""Battle"". Unlike the documentary on Krumping called ""Rize"", which many viewers will have seen and probably led you to this film, the dance battle in this DVD has a poor venue (a small garage with no more than 30 or so spectators, most of whom look like they've never heard of Krumping and are definitely NOT from the streets) versus the Great Western Forum packed with 10,000 urban dance fans in ""Rize"".At the end of the movie Shabba-Doo calls it a tie, which is a complete joke and ruins the whole movie. After watching the battle it's obvious that the raw unchoreographed energy of the Krumpers outshines the ho-hum highly-practised and passion-less breaking moves of the breakers. It's like watching a battle between a group of Warriors (Krumpers) against some effeminate Ballerinas (Breakers). At the end of all of that to call a ""Tie"" is a complete cop-out."
2,Well we learn one thing about Krumping.,"Good documentary for one reason. We learn that the new dance form known as ""Krumping"" is little more than an excuse for angry spastics to show you just how angry and spastic they can be. In order to regard the Krumpers as coming anywhere near the BBoys in the final battle, you have to toss out such silly ideas as skill and technique. It all becomes a matter of how strange you can look. I waited patiently for one of the Krumpers to tear off all of his clothes, simulate raping a women, cut himself with a razor blade and then leap from the rafters. Yeah, that would be original and self-expressive and ""energetic"", but it wouldn't be impressive dancing.Krumping is not ready for prime time."
2,A Writer's Guide to Transitional Words and Expressions,"I had expected the book to have more pages and content. Instead, what it gave was basically some lists of words and expressions which might be found in other general grammar and language books. If I had known that this book was going to be merely a list of all those expressions given in it, and contained merely just a few pages, I would definitely not have ordered it. Hence I was very disappointed in it. It did not provide me with any new knowledge, or anything unusual and memorable for language application."
3,Good reference list,"It's a fairly basic list to expressions and transitional words. For the experienced writer, it's extremely useful list. There's no explanation of how to use the words for the unexperienced writer, but it's still worth the buy."
1,32 pages! No sentenses inside,"It just barely has 32 pages! Amazon shows 48 pages, but in fact there are many blank ""Notes"" pages at the end.All the content are words list. There is not even one sentence in there.Just like an index at the behind of a book.Nothing more.Returned it after the first glance. Amazon recommended it to me. I should not have trust it."
2,Fails repeatedly.,"This sensor performs the key functions of the WMR968 remote weather sensing system. I have had this system for three years and have had to replace this sensor annually, just after the warrenty would expire. In addition, when trying to find a replacement, it is usually ""out of stock"" for 2 to 3 months. There are serious reliability issues with this system. I now keep a new sensor in reserve to avoid long down times. When it works it's great. I will not however, choose this company's products in the future."
2,Had to return it.,"The item came on time but the device,a combined temperature, humidity sensor, was way off on the temperature, 10-15 degrees, sometimes high, sometimes low. I was unable to assess the accuracy of the humidity sensor. I returned it this week to the distributor. Will see what the response is."
1,"Premature Failure, Poor Company Support","WMR-968 / WMR-918 / WMR-112A Outdoor Thermometer/Hygrometer w/Solar Transmitter. This item failed within warranty; however, I have been informed that it has been ""discontinued"" and no allowance or compensation is available. Sail clear of this company."
2,"Okay, but slight imperfections","I bought these shoes because this was the only place I could find this shoe and this size. While I love the style and look of these shoes, and they are comfortable, the fabric on the heel is rather bumpy. If this was not the only place I could find this shoe and size, I would have returned them."
1,"There is only 1 Battery, not 2 as shown in the picture","I filed an Image error with Amazon notifying them that the Image shows two Batteries, but there is only one.In their wisdom they determined there was nothing wrong with the Image, so this is just an alert for anyone looking at ordering this product."
5,Nice!,"In fact I want another one,friend kept aggravating me to get it and finally I did.I will get one soon."
4,Where is Phil Collins?,"Where is Phil Collins? I know the licensing for In The Air Tonight was probably cost prohibitive, but the Phil Collins song was featured well in some key scenes in the film. That said, the album is great."
4,ATHFCMFFT is My Dad!!!,"This soundtrack is awesome but short. You get to hear the great songs from this movie. It starts with master shake singing his great ballad and movies right along into some head smashing metal(Mastadon, Unearth. The soundtrack has a few tracks with the guys from the Hunger Force telling us what they think of the sondtrack. And of course you get meetwad at the end showing us he can rock out. I would recamend this to any die hard fan of the show and anyone who loved the movie. And to any one who loves metal!!!`"
5,"Compelling, hypnotic, uncompromising","This short novel pulls no punches. It is beautifully written, and I note that the author has received praise from no less than Don DeLillo: ""a strong and hypnotic piece of writing"". Leigh's descriptions of the Tasmanian wilderness transport the reader into another world. Haven't read a survival story - physical, emotional, ecological - like it."
5,FASCINATING TO THE SOUL/SPIRIT/MIND,"I read this book,this is my 3rd review, This book is an entire thesis for the soul/spirit/mind/ only. According to the author this thesis of prose/poems will only be published by the creed of the author, The author states: 'The Holy Spirit' is the only agent to publish/promote this mysterious excellent prose to the people, to promote Jesus Christ's name only via the Holy Spirit's promotional stage. The Author States: ""The Holy Spirit is her helper'--(Agent/or other) to publish this book in the secular Market. The Author states: 'No one, comes to the Father (God) but by Jesus Christ, via the Holy Spirit forces, related and registered in God's Word.The author also states firmly, 'The Holy Spirit' is MY AGENT TO PUBLISH THIS BOOK.'When the Holy Spirit (Her agent) comes, then this book will be published in millions/possibly billions of copies. for 'GOD'S GLORY ONLY'*** eND**"
4,Unique and stimulating,Great tale. Sets the stage for many more adventures. The evolution of Trent through the book was masterful. Recommended read.
5,Now I know why the Xanth books have been as popular as they have been,"Bink is seemingly a freak of nature, a young man without the slightest hint of magical ability, and in the magical land of Xanth that leaves him with only one possible future - exile. He first decides to travel to see the Good Magician Humphrey, in the hopes that Humphrey can discover a hidden magic ability. However, there are many dangers in the land of Xanth, and Bink is going to need all the luck in the world to just survive - luck and some magic!This is the first Xanth book that I have read, and I must say that I enjoyed it immensely. It is very well written, with a lot of nice magic and adventure, and yet some interesting and at time hilarious interactions among the characters. Now I know why the Xanth books have been as popular as they have been - they're great!"
4,"A fun read, but not much more than that.","A Spell for Chameleon is a pretty entertaining read. Xanth'sconcept of magic is different and refreshing. Anthony'swriting style is easy to read but unless you really enjoypuns, the book becomes tiresome. This book is recommended,however, like all of Piers Anthony's series, after ASpell for Chameleon, the series quickly deteriorates intoa source of income for the author, with no apparent thoughtgiven to the actual stories. He seems to only put words onpaper because he knows people will buy them."
5,Magical,"""A Spell for Chameleon"" is a very good book.This book has action,adventure,and science fiction.This book is about a person named Bink.He is trying to find his magical talent so he's not exiled from Xanth.he decides to go to the great magician Humfrey.He starts his journey and heads for the great magician.The magician couldn't identify his talent. All the magician could say was it was strong magic. Bink went home hoping not to be exiled.Bink was twenty-four and going to turn twenty-five and if he doesn't find his magic soon he would be excled.He waits nervously til it's his turn to demonstrate his magic talent.Will he demonstrate his magic or will he be exiled?"
5,"So full of puns, if you ""Bink"", you'll miss one!","Having been hooked on Science Fantasy since reading ""The Magic Goes Away"" by Larry Niven, this book was my introduction to Piers Anthony, and he reeled me in at every turn. But far from being 500 puns strung together to form a story, the characters are wonderful, the plot well devised, and and the descriptions so vivid my own imagination stepped aside to let a master take over. I wish I-95S led to Xanth instead of Florida."
4,A great beginning to the Xanth series,"Peirs Anthony is incredible. . . and his Xanth series is a perfect example of that. Although my favorite book in the series still remains The Source of Magic, A Spell for Chameleon was what got me hooked. Bink is the best!!!!!! Fantasy fans, rock on!"
4,Excellent book for those who like crazy magic,"A Spell For Chameleon is a wonderful book. In the magical world of Xanth, almost anything can happen, from a carpet flying overhead to trees growing food and clothing for any passerby. The characters find themselves in all sorts of kooky dilemmas, keeping the reader guessing as to what a character will stumble upon next (if it's a Tangle Tree, they're in for a fight). From colored hail storms to computers that can control others actions, these books are nonstop fun and fantasy!"
3,Great series for a young adult,"I wish I had found the Xanth series in junior high or high school, it would have saved me from a lot of Star Wars novels. The Xanth series is reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Anthony has a lot to say about the world and relationships and he prefers to say it through his novels. A Spell for Chameleon is a good book and very light read. It serves to introduce the world of Xanth via a couple journeys that are pleasant an easily understandable. For me, the book was a bit lighter than is my usual preference, but if I was going for a relaxing vacation and wanted a light book that I could enjoy without much effort, a Xanth novel would do me quite nicely."
4,Very good book yet i find,I found this book to be very good and i was from then on very interested to read the rest of his series. I think that he has a great imagination but i found the other novels in this series were not as good yet I would class this won as great fun. I hope you read it.
1,"Dreadful,one for younger audiences perhaps?","Slow plot,dull storyline and boring predictable puns.Could do better myself!Stear clear of this book unless you have money to burn,in which case just burn it and save yourself the effort of reading this drivel."
1,Awful,"I picked up this book because I enjoy humorous fantasy. What a terrible mistake. Anthony's much vaunted ""humor"" boils down to lots and lots of idiotic puns. Add to that a so-so plot, half developed characters, and blatant sexism, and you have a truly bad book."
5,Excellent fantasy novel,"This is witty, exciting book. It keeps you enthralled, but it isn't too serious. It is a fairly light read, and is good to take on trips with you, but be forewarned -- this book is hard to put down once you've started it!"
4,A Punderful Adventure,"I was quite taken with this tale. I claim no expertise in the field of fantasy, or anywhere else, for that matter. But I do have a fairly well-rounded reading experience and I found this little book to be a refreshing escape from my Mundania existence.The hero, Bink, is a hero inspite of himself. Bink is a resident of Xanth, a land filled with magic, of which Bink has none and he has precious little ego. He is to be exiled to Mundania, a land filled with ego and no magic. From this premise many delightful adventures in the world of Xanth ensue; a world much better visited with Piers Anthony as your guide.On second thought, maybe there is some magic in Mundania after all."
5,Great fun book,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It was silly, but I found it amusing. It had a terrific ending. This book isn't for everyone, especially those who are looking for serious fantasy, but if you like the humorous, silly and light, then you will enjoy this book. Please take the time to read the first couple of pages, then if you find it to be something that you would enjoy, then buy the book. It is a quick and fun read, very humourous, and full of silliness. Xanth, in my opinion, is a great creation and great for comic relief. As stated before, this book is a quick read, and is good if you are looking for a break from more serious reading."
5,A Must Read Fantasy,"I read this book about 4 years ago and it still stands out as one of the best fantasy books i have ever read. i have already read the first six books of the series but have stopped to read incarnations of immortality which, is also awesome. I write my fantasy books but i could only hope to write as well as Piers Anthony. Don't read this unless you plan on getting hooked on all twenty-seven books."
5,Great,"This is one of the best fantasy novels ever written. Set in the magic land of Xanth, it tells the story of a man named Bink who must determine what his magic power is before he turns twenty-five, or else he will be exiled forever. The great magician Humphrey is certain that Bink has great powers, but believes that somebody is trying to hide them. There are plenty of surprises and scenes of great suspense throughout the novel. Some people might view the ending as a rip-off, but really this isn't a novel that's read for its plot.What makes this book so good is that Anthony doesn't take himself too seriously. It's filled with outrageous puns and jokes, and the author never stays in a serious mood for very long before reverting to a humorour scene. That's the real reason that ""A Spell for Chameleon"" and the ensuing sequels are still so amazingly popular."
2,"The first, but not the best in the Xanth series.","One thing thi snovel has going for it is that it is the starting point for the Xanth series. It is not as pun-filled or sarcastic as some of the others in the series.If you like your light fantasy reading with a bit of comedy, then this is a book and a series for you."
2,Blueprint for making money,"Ok, this book is not so bad by itself.Obviously written for a younger crowd with its juvenile puns and predictable plot.The low rating it gets though is becasue it is like the first spot of mold in a bathroom.While not bad by itself it has spawned the Xanth series. A seemingly never ending procession of books with EXACTLY THE SAME STORY.The only thing new we see in the procession is the puns.Oh my lord the puns.Read this one, enjoy it. Maybe even read a few more from the series. But save your money o the whole line if books. You will never see anything you haven't seen before as you keep reading book after midless book.I swear Asprin just has a basic outline of action and he goes in and just changes the settings and names, makes three new trials and works off that."
2,B-rate fiction,"Too many monsters that have little meaning to the plot, and stereotypes galore really clutter up this little book, making it 300+ pages when it should have been 200. The prose is fair to lame, the characters flat, and the issues, well, not riveting. The land of Xanth is definitely the most compelling aspect of this book, but the story telling leaves it with little to do."
1,Painfully sexist and cliche,"Anthony seems to lack a basic grip of common courtesy, and any grip at all of sense. A Spell for Chameleon operates on the basic principle that pretty women cannot be intelligent and intelligent women are, by nature, ugly; a theory that is degrading to women everywhere. Anthony also makes no secret of this thesis, stating the above overtly towards the end of the book. Anythony's puns are trite and dull, and his characters tired cliches. By far, one of the worst fantasy writers I have every read, to the point where even mentioning his name is banned at some fantasy cons."
1,Parents beware,"This book is the first of the Xanth series, a fantasy series targetting adolescent boys in their young teens (the years in which I read the first 9). On the surface, they seem like a light fantasy read in a world of magic. For instance, in this one, Bink goes on a quest to find his magical power, gets exhiled, encounters the ""evil"" magician Trent, finds love, and helps establish a new King of Xanth.So what's the problem? The problem is the over sexed nature of Xanth. Topless female centaurs and mermaids, and fully nude nymphs (though I don't recall if they were in this one exactly, but they are in many of the later ones) just to name a few of the resisdants of this ""fantasy"" land (one can guess what kind of fantasy).As an adolescent boy, I read these numerous times. At the time, I thought they were geared for older audiences. As an adult, I'm embarrased I ever had them on my bookshelf and am appalled the way these books (which is so clear now) are targetted for children."
5,This is my personnel favorite.,"This book is great, in my opinion. Instead of having the ups and downs of the normal book, where parts of it are great, and the rest is kind of dull, this book has a consistency. No point is noticebly worse then the rest, since the action is constant. It's serious, but manages to be funny with some clever puns. It manages to be enjoyable and seem nonchalant, and still deal with some very adult, mature topics. I think it's the best part I've ever read"
4,A delightful tale starts the series well.,"Be warned: if you fall in love with this book, you'll want to read the 2,000 sequels, and after three or four of them, you'll realise your mistake. They're much, much inferior.This is by far the best of the Xanth series--a terrific little book, funny, exciting, with a perfect twist of an ending. Anthony's excesses are even somewhat charming when encountered for the first time (sexism, puns, billions of uninteresting supporting characters., etc.). It really is worth the read.Xanth is a marvellous place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. Everybody has a magical talent of lesser or greater degree, but our hero seems to lack one, and heads for exile and adventure.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for really original works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
2,Not Good,I can't believe how popular this is. It was not good. I suppose I would have liked it when I was 10 years old.
3,"Light fantasy, good for the young audience.","This book is, by itself, quite good. As a total series, the Xanth books are good for the younger audiences. There are, however, and as noted by a reader above, sexual inuendoes, so a parent may wish to review each book before all a child to read it. I personally read them at ten and loved them. They were one of the series that got me started on fantasy. However, having aged four years and my tastes changed, I realize that they are very light fantasy. Every once in a while when I feel a need for a fast and fun adventure, I may pick up a book in the series and read it and a few others. Xanth is not, however, a deep and insightful series, merely a good adventure. Don't let Xanth restrict your later reading."
5,new life given to an old favorite,One of my childhood favorites. I have had many many adventures thanks to the world of Xanth. I would gladly recommend the whole series to anyone.
3,"Well, it might be useful in a classroom . . . I guess . . .","A solidly mediocre collection of sentimental stories about teens growing up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood.I kept wanting the short stories to add up to something big and meaningful, especially after I figured out that she was reusing characters between the short stories. They never did.Using one or two of the short stories in a classroom or as part of a program might be done to good effect. The whole book, however, was a bit much to take."
1,Extremely stereotypical,"Before I read this book, I had no knowledge what-so-ever on Puerto Rican culture; but if I based my opinions on what the author talks about in this book I would come to the conclusion that all Puerto Rican kids are either disrespectful little punks or absolutley weird nerds, which is, of course, BS. I know Cofer is an excellent author, but this books just wasn't her pot of tea! It's stupid and degrading."
2,Strange choice of words,"I'm not sure the audience for this book. Among the 1500 words are such ""essential"" words as ""Texas"", ""their"", ""there"" and ""They're"" -- which I can assume are aimed at a beginner in the English language; but then there are obscure words such as ""phaeton"" -- a four-wheeled carriage drawn by horses that was made obsolete by the automobile. Words such as these I guess would be helpful for anyone who plans to do some time-travel. Some of the words are rediculously basic -- such as ""cord"" -- ""a thin piece of rope, plastic, etc."" and some are rediculously obscure -- ""nonillion"" -- ""a very large number equal to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000"". I think you might be better off purchasing a dictionary for the next time someone uses ""phaeton"" or ""nonillion"" -- because the chances of you seeing these words are one in a nonillion."
2,This book is a waste of money.,"... a HUGE waste of money. (...) I bought this book to help me with my vocab, and possibly to help me slowly study for the verbal section of the GRE. Unfortunately the words are toughies like ""already"" (p.16), ""fluency"" (p.102), and ""seasonal"" (p.213). The vast majority of these words are words that 95% of people already know. I have only come across four words out of the 1500 that I didn't know. My advice: buy something else."
3,This bangs better than the ANALOG BROS.,"First thing you listen out for is the production (which sounds similar to KUTMASTA KURT). Next is KOOL KEITH's rhyme flow (always offbeat,which is a GOOD thing). H-BOMB & MARC LIVE do they thing. But when Double K isn't vexed,he's a great rapper. Superior! When he lets emcees and others call him out to diss them (see ""SPANKMASTER""),he loses the KOOL to KORNY (just like on this joint). KHM's ""GAME"" is slightly better than ANALOG BROTHERS' ""PIMP TO EAT"". If you wanna hear KEITH come off in a group effort,two only come to mind. OCTAGON and ULTRAMAGNETIC,go back in time! Solo,""SEX STYLE"",period!"
2,Honestly,"KHM is an obvious attempt at trying to sound commercial, yet original. Marc Live's production is real ""New York style"" with Keith's influence of using synth sounds. There is NO WAY IN HELL this touches Analog Brothers. Keith's rapping in this is very lazy and boring, Marc is just an ok rapper, and Jacky totally destroys the tracks.*All REAL Kool Keith and Ultra fans know that the CLAYBORNE FAMILY is much better than this one by Keith, Marc, and Jacky! But your average listener wouldn't know nothing about that."
3,"i hate to say it, but...","...keith sounds pretty tired on this disc. literally, on the first couple of tracks -- groggy, constricted voice that suggests inhalant abuse (not that i'm saying that's what it is...) -- and figuratively throughout. as befits the legend, there are the expected great moments (""black man in the white worlllllld!""), and mark live/h-bomb sound better than they ever have on previous k.k. releases. the music is way electro-bouncy, and a good deal more sophisticated than the electro-casio choogle of _spankmaster_. anyways, this is more of a mark live album, with most of the compositional/production credits going to him, despite mr. thornton's top-billing. not bad, let's wait for keith's next solo joint...and the k-double-o-l some hall's mentho-lyptus with the quicknus..."
3,Old lyrical content,"Keith's new album has some great moments in the beats category, the rhymes are still fabulous, but Mr. Keith needs some new things to rap about.Lyricly, It's Matthew and Spankmaster. Criticizing Keith copycats. Record Labels. Originality. Rap. Sex...The record itself is immersed in a dingy darkness that gets to you. This is the only part of the album that makes it interesting. The whole thing clocks in around 55 minutes (a shorter rap album is often a tighter one. no filler here). Most tracks are very slow and unsettling compared to his other stuff. The beats are good. The skits are worth the time. Tracks flow into each other like Spankmaster. He'll probably continue with this style.I DON'T RECCOMEND it because it's everything you've heard before. I reccomend the brighter, funnier Spankmaster. (""Why you have to look at me so stupid like that?"")But if you're a fan, get it anyway."
4,Space Bounce,"This CD lived up to the ""Space Bounce"" name Keith was throwing around for the style before it was released. It's a good cd with some fresh ... beats...just think ""Mack Trucks"". Keith isn't as funny as he usually is but he shines on tracks like ""Game"" and ""Space"". Honestly, I could've done without H-Bomb and Marc Live that's why I gave it a 4, sometimes they just don't fit in and really mess the song up with their wack flows. All in all it's one I'll be listening to for quite a while and bumpin it in my ride while other fools are bumpin that faker Andre 3000 for the summer. Pick this joint up, it won't disappoint."
4,Good penny holder,"This item was purchased by my son. He likes them except the pennies are kind of hard to get in the folders. The pennies are easy to identify in which slot they are to be inserted. Overall, he is happy with this purchase."
5,Penny folder holder,"Picked this up and several other coin folders from Whitman and I am very happy with them. This penny coin folder holds the coins well and the coins sit just right that you can insert them with your finger and feel secure that it wont pop off. Recommended!Stay away from the 1959-1998 folder, I have gotten 2 and the holes are extremely tight."
4,"Lincoln Cents Folder #2, 1941-1974","It is a great place to store my pennies in Lincoln Cents Folder #2, 1941-1974 . That all. what more do U want."
4,Definitely not the same old thing!,"Although this book is not my usual literary fare, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pace was exciting. The plot was original with a surprising outcome. The characters were well developed in an interesting fashion. The author presented a deeply realistic picture of the Vietnam war from the inside. I never expected to enjoy a book that even had the word war in it, yet I found myself truly caring for the characters, immersed in the realistic background and fascinated by the plot twist. I am looking forward to hearing more from the main character in future books!"
1,Merchant of Venice to Avoid,"I'm still searching for THE version to use in my classroom that will do the job. This was extremely boring and hard to follow. The Al Pacino version was much better as far as interesting to watch. This version does a much better job of following the original intent of the play and not getting caught up in political correctness. Safe to show in your classroom, but be prepared for your students to sleep through it."
2,Busted already,"I have had this thing in the car for about 2 weeks now. The right speaker busted, and I dont listen to music very loud at all. Please, spend the extra money and get good speakers! I will never order anything PYLE ever again."
2,speaker quality,There was a buzzing/rattling noise coming from the speakers that was not part of the music being played. Sound quality was unsatisfactory.
3,I didnt like them.,"Maybe for the price they are OK, but if you need decent sound I think you should look somewhere else. They have a cheap component system that is why better tyhan this pair. The are sure potent, but not as much as the 500watts advertised. The speakers where connected to a 200watts amplifier and they broke after a few months of use and the volume had to be checked all the time because they started to sound totally distorted.I never liked them, and the fact that they broke with 200 watts amp not at max power says something about the quality of this things. As i said, if you just need some sound for the car they are probably OK, but if want nice sound, these are not the ones for you."
1,sound good BUT Falsely advertised!!!,I had 4 of these speakers powered by a 1000 watt amp so they were very underpowered. But still two of them blew after just 4 months. These speakers put out loud decent sound considering how cheap they are. expected them to last a bit longer but thats not the reason for the poor review. I was tinkering around with the blown speakers I noticed two of the tweeters didn't have any wires running to them. turns out two of the tiny half inch size tweeters are fake. All 4 of my speakers were the same way. That makes them 6-way speakers not eight-way like advertised in the title. Looks like PYLE purposefully took a short cut in production then lied about it. Would you consider that false advertising?? I know I do...
3,"decent, cant handle too much power though","i hooked these up to a 400 watt peak 100 rms dual brand amp in my bonneville, and they sounded great until one developed a bad rattle 2 weeks later. if you get these, dont overpower them."
2,Unhappy,I bought these speakers and used them only one day connected to a 180 watt amp before the problem started. It's like they came apart. I call Amazon and they were replaced but the second set is worse. I will not buy another set but still will shop Amazon.
2,"Buy it used, if at all!","The book has some wedding history in it, but I would not purchase this book again. From the title and an Amazon.com search, I anticipated more cultural traditions, and while there are a few intertwined in the writing, they are not clearly defined. Everyone is different, so I hope that if you do purchase this book, you find something useful in it! I gave it 2 stars for an easy read."
4,Great supplement for middle school science,"For the subjects this book covers, it is a very useful supplement to middle school learning- it makes English sense of all the formulas and processes, to really cement in learning. Many real-world examples to make formulas make sense. It helps my son get a different side of what was discussed in class, for a full understanding (and better grades)."
4,keeping the lead IN the pencil,Does anyone know what to do in order to keep the lead in the Delta 0.9mm (Medium) pencil? I'm going nuts trying to figure this out. PLEASE RESPOND TO ME AT jbm@jbmlg.com
2,We simply can't get it to fly,"No matter how windy the day, how patient we are, or how experienced a friend we enlist to put this darned thing into the air, we cannot get it to fly.... My 9 year old is hugely disappointed by it."
3,Its Roots Are Showing,"This book was published circa 1992 as a Harlequin (Romance)Intrigue. The Intrigue line consisted of short romance novels that had a suspense subplot. The length and the emphasis of the novel was dictated by the publisher. So it's hard to blame Dr. Gerritsen for the short-comings of this novel.Her characters are pretty good, the plot is weakish. Someone who reads her books for the suspense will probably not like this one. Those who read for the romance will probably be taken with this one.Take your pick.Oh, and the new Mira cover is rather bizarre. Intellectually, I know it's a flower. My impression though is that it is a picture of the stuffing coming out of something."
1,Missing in action.,"More than sufficient time passes -- no product, no response. It's not the money as much as the idea that some few ruin the record for small business."
5,Great Traditional Bluegrass,"This is a good traditional bluegrass band. I heard one of their earlier CD's and loved it. Recently, I got the opportunity to see them in person. They are all good musicians and good singers. It was a real treat to see them in person, and I will be checking their schedule to see when they are in the area again. This CD has some really good numbers on it and to see them perform them in person was definitely a treat!"
3,better than watching the whole thing,"This is the condensed version. The real telenovela has a BUNCH of episodes, this has 5 discs and skips some. You can still follow the story line perfectly and it was totally entertaining. I got it for a class and loved it."
2,"Skip this, buy the DVD","This is not worth your money. The disk is full of someone rambling about Audioslave, occaisionally getting dates wrong, and saying nothing particularly insightful. If you are thinking of buying this to get clips of the band, don't bother. There are 10 second ""interviews"" at the beginning of each track, many of which are ripped right off the DVD, and that's it.This WOULD be a good tool for someone who was looking to learn about the history of the band, except it is far to expensive. Im sure you can find someone who will tell you the story for free. If you are looking to buy this because you are starving for more of the great band, buy the DVD, and if you already have that, then this has nothing new to offer you."
4,Angel In Romania,"The plot for Angel: The Curse is interesting, Angel goes to Romania to remove the curse the gypsies placed on him(not to remove his soul, but to remove the block preventing him from experienceing a moment of true love). It supposedly takes place after the events of the final episode of the TV series ""Not Fade Away"", but if your hoping to discover the final results of the series finale your looking in the wrong direction. Though Angel: The Curse lacks answers to the many questions going through the heads of fans, it does serve as an intriguing Angel story, and is recommended to all who still long for the show."
4,Definitely worth reading,"This was my first Angel graphic novel to read, and it didn't disappoint. The story was really cool, finding our hero back in Rumania looking for a cure to his curse. I have no complaints about the story at all, and it had some good action in it, and felt like Angel all around.As far as the artwork, I have a couple thoughts. The inks were great; nice bold, solid blacks and Angel actually looked like Angel, which is no easy thing to do, artistically. Now, as an amateur artist myself (who loves comic art) I had a little bit of an issue with the coloring. The gradients used on the faces were too smooth and unnatural looking. It ended up making the artwork look rather flat because the planes of the face and skull weren't taken into consideration. So, I'd like to have seen some better colors in this.Overall this was certainly worth a read for any Angel fan, and I'm getting ready to read ""After The Fall"" next."
2,what a difference a day makes,"Imagine my delight at discovering two Lalo violin concertos other than the spectacular Symphonie espagnole! Imagine my chagrin at hearing the Concerto in F major, a disjointed display of technique written expressly for de Sarasate. Olivier Charlier's anemic fiddling, often drowned out by the blaring BBC, was anything but complementary to this concerto. The Concerto russe fares better. Although only one recording producer and sound engineer are noted in the liner notes, I believe they were both taken out and shot between the two days of recording. The balance between the violinist and orchestra in the Concerto russe was grealy improved, and some saintly person involved in this recording got Charlier to play this piece entirely in tune. As for the Overture and Scherzo...they're swell, but really, who would buy this for those works?"
1,No review review,"This system does not fit ALL 93-97 Del Sols. Mine is a '97 S model. This system does not fit the S model. The cat is different, the lead pipe is different and the mounting flange is different. I will say it does appear to be a very well built system. Nothing tinny or flimsy about it. I just couldn't use it. I will also say that the price was the best I found on the net and the service from Amazon was excellent.P.S.I had to mark a star for this review, so I picked one star.Not because I hated it, but because I couldn't use it."
5,limited edition is the most random and best cd i've gotten,"i just saw nhoi this tuesday. two days ago, wow, feels like longer, since they were so good that i'm so sad that the show is over. haha. but, this cd is insanely good and hilarious. there's a cover of buttercup by the foundations, they have their little tequila song at the end of the last track and veronica...wow. that song is hilarious. at the show he was screaming, i hate you, and everyone had their flip up and were screaming with him. so...everyone should buy this cd, it's great. i didn't buy it until the show, and jeff talked to me and asked me if i had ever heard of them...and i had to say no...so don't feel stupid like me, haha, and be smart and buy this cd, and go see them on their allister, over it,& hipv tour. it's one sick show. you won't regret going and you won't regret buying this cd."
5,Never Heard of It rules!,"I had never heard of them until I met Nate from the band at the mall and he sold me this CD a few weeks before it was officially realeased and it is awesome. I've listened to it about 100 times. Every song is great and you can listen to the whole thing. The best songs are ""Alone"", ""She's Over It"", and ""Waste of Time"". Get it right now...you won't be disappointed."
5,THE BEST!,nhoi is the be best! they are the best band band ever...sorta...they are up there with all my favorites. i first heard of them at the nfg and gc concert and dj came to us and was like yea we are nhoi and let us listen to their cd...it was the best!!! they also perfomed and they were awesome...go and buy their cd...u weill not be upset
4,The Complete Guide to Psychiatric Drugs: Straight Talk for Best Results,This book is very easy to understand. It is a great resource for clinicians and therapists.
3,Humdrum,"Good book, mostly straightforward. Not anything too particular. worthy enough of a buy, or a browse. shouldn't be looked into that much though."
2,What happend Capcom!!?,Devil May Cry was a classic with great gameplay and had lots of style...This...doesn't! I will make this a short review...The game had good visuals like the original but was lacking on good story and was waaaaaaay too short and too easy. Devil May Cry was easy to learn and was a bit of a challenge but this was just complete bull..Too easy and waaaaay too short. This is nothing like Devil May Cry 1.Overall I have to give this..2.2 out of 5 starsGame is lacking in a lot of places and is just painfully bad. No were near the original Devil May Cry..This game has lots and lots of flaws..Just wait for Devil May Cry 2 comes out cause hopefully it will be waaaaay better then this (...)..(...)
1,A Big Bore!!!,"I got this game thinking I would have a great time playing, but was soon disappointed... the weapons are cool, the graphics are okay, but all the elements of the game just don't seem to come together...Don't buy this game!"
2,"Tedious, In Your Face, Watered-Down Action!","I didn't play the original Devil May Cry, but I heard a lot of good things about it so I picked up the sequel. I thought the fact that the box and manual played up the whole ""Dante's cool as hell, and the new girl is sexy and dangerous"" so much was funny.The game is tedious. You could easily stand there and pound the fire button and get through the entire game. Add in some combos, different weapons, and jumping attacks and...well, you don't add much at all. They don't really say where you are, why you're there, and what random boss you're fighting as you advance through the game which leaves you with a sense of ""who cares?""I played it for a few minutes and instantly wanted to take it back. I beat the whole thing in a couple of hours, hoping that things would get better later in the game. It didn't.It's a decent looking game, and it would be good for a quick rental but nothing more."
2,A Lousy-looking Letdown,"To fans of DMCry 1, this game will be a disappointing shock. The inventiveness and really beautiful design of the first aren't here. Gameplay is shoot-stab-jump. The colors don't pop, there's a lot of gray, many of the settings are modern apartment buildings, not the lushly colored twisting tunnels and castle dungeons of the first. Amazing somebody would devalue the franchise this much just to make a $$$. Replay the first game."
3,Well... it's a sequel,"Devil May Cry 2 starts off when Lucia (the red haired girl) in a museum in the middle of the night when she was attacked by demons. She fends them off and suddenly Dante comes falling through the ceiling and shooting down the last of the demons. When I first played the game about 2 years ago, I was wondering, ""What happened to Trish (the blond demon girl for people who haven't played the original) from the first game?"" The second game you go through different missions just like the other games in the series, but when your inventory's a bit different. For example, throughout the game, you'll find parts for the amulet which boosts your abilities in Devil Trigger (Demon Form) which allows you to do stuff like add element bonuses to your attacks like fire, ice, etc. It also allows you to move faster, fly, heal faster, etc. Parts of it is kind of cheesy, but the game is worth your time as far as sequels go."
1,Horrible,"This game shouldn't even be out in stores it's so bad. It's to easy, to short, and it has a horrible story line. The boss fights are easy and not as cool as the ones in the fist dmc. None of the weapons are all the same, none of them have special abilitys like the Ifirt gloves. It has a few cool things like running up walls and having 2 characters, but it doesn't make a difference in gameplay. If you want a good game like this look at the orignal Devil May Cry, Legacy Of Kain:Defiance, or one of the Onimusha games."
1,capcom destroyed something beautiful,"the origin of everything wrong in this game is that capcom had a different team working on the game. the combat is dull even though you have a lot of moves. the different team is the origin of the HORRIBLE plot and the CHEESY dialogue. honestly, where did that dumb coin come from. The prequel was a classic but this game is so horrible in comparison. Lucia, pick an accent and stick with it, nuff said. this game took out the desire of looking forward to a devil may cry 3. stop tryng to make this game look good with positive reviews b/c you're just lying. DMC fans: face it this game was not satisfactory, thats it for the DMC series. don't waste your good money on this, buy a real gothic action game from the LOK series...PLEASE."
3,"Dante is cool, but Lucia ,well...","Dante moves are very cool, and the weapons too. Some scenarios are great, but the story is a $@&%#. Lucia is so bad, she doesn't cause any damage and the devil trigger is very bad."
3,My Opinion.....,"You've most likely read the reviews that have gone into great detail about every aspect of this game, so I won't go into any of that. My short opinion of this game is that it was rushed by Capcom to get it out and make a quick buck. Simply, it is just a boring game that is only average. I know a lot of people said the first game had a bad plot (which I didn't agree with) so I figured they were just saying the same about the sequel. I've watched stuff on mid-day TV more interesting than this. Bad looks and horrid controls just make it worse. Even if you are a hardcore DMC fan (like me) I would still suggest renting this game before buying."
2,I DID cry,"I was not impressed with this game at all. It seemed to me that the creators were thinking a little too big.In the first DMC most all of the fights were close up and personal so you could see in great detail each and every slash. In DMC2 it's like playing Contra, you just jump around shooting things you can't see and Slashing once and awhile.Also who can forget the great question of the first game ""would you like to play in easy mode?"". What made the first DMC so great was that it was a very difficult game to play, and anyone who doesn't think so probobly played in easy mode.However in this newer version I almost fell asleep it was so easy. You can kill almost everything in the first half with just the pistols.I will say however that there were some improvements on the controls and interface of the game. The quick weapon change buttons, and the devil power abilites were nice, but they don't make up for the other stuff."
3,confusing,this is a pretty fun game but it gets old quikly the camera angles and lack of information makes it so hard to find out what your supposed to be doing and there is hardly any story and it seems dante and every one else is emotion and personalityless
2,"""This Game Sucks""","First of all it keeps repeating itself, and it never stops. You keep killing the same creatures over and over again. This is a boring game, their is really no point in making this game. Dante bairly says a word for the full 6 hours. That right folks, this game is 6 hours long. Most of the best gamers in the world will beat it in 3 hours. The story is terrible and I am not looking forward to the third installment, if there is going to be one."
2,Truthful and real,"this game adjusts to your ability as a player makes the initail game very easy and take little time. i was under the impression of it would adjust and give challenge, but no. DMC1 was a hit and took time and skill, while this claimed to take twice the time and be one of the best games ever..... everone has bashed it, and acutally had due cause, if you have played DMC1 don't play this, if you are yet to play any of the series start with this so that DMC1 is better"
3,What were they thinking?,"What were they thinking? I can't believe they called this Devil May Cry! Dante is not longer Dante, he's been toned down, and Lucia's part of the game is basically a dup of Dante's, slightly changed, and a tad shorter. They've fixed some of the problems that many observed in the first edition, but they've removed some of the elements that made DMC such a great game. Combos are too easy, levels are too spaced out to have the fun of close hand to hand combat that helped make DMC great.Its still a good game, but not nearly the caliber that DMC was. The camera angle problem was corrected, which is the reason this did not get 2 stars.RENT/Borrow THE GAME FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY IT.If you dont like it, this may save you $50.If you like it, then there are numerous places online you can get it to recover the $3-5 rental fee..."
1,what happened? It used to be fun.,"all i have to say is the second DMC has an uneventful storyline, hardly any action and when there is action you can't help but ask yourself 'why am playing this and what do i care?' the battles are far and few, the bosses seem to come out of nowhere making you scratch your head in confusion and the graphics (besides the cutscenes) look just like the first DMC"
2,WHAT A BLOW....,"First, TEHERE IS NO STORY-LINE WHATSOEVER.Second, it's camera work often makes you frustrated so that you can stick you Dual-shock controller up into the ceiling.Third, the battle action is so dull, slow-paced, and reapeated until you get sick of it. (By all means, do not expect some cool, stylish sword actions from the first game.)Need I say more?...Nope. I think I made my point.SUGGESTIONS: *DO NOT* BUY THIS GAME JUST YET. RENT IT FIRST. YOU WILL THANK ME DEARLY :)"
4,good game,"i think the graphics are better on this game and the moves and you can become sparda and play trish but i liked storyline,weapons,and bosses on the first game devil may cry 1 rocked devil may cry 2 was sweet but not as good as dmc1 dante was better in dmc2 and lucia sucked her levels every thing i think devil may cry 1 is the best i cant belive i traded it in at a store called gamexchange for devil may cry 2 im working on hard mode to get trish right now im on level 16 and cant beat it but i loved the first one alot better than the second"
2,devil may cry 2,I for one was very dissapointed in this game. I enjoyed the first devil may cry cause the game was sat on one person and it remind me alot of resident evil. This new one hasn't got any real changes the camera really sucks your far off from the chacters. Fighting enemys is a breeze just walk up to them and beat them up. Boss battles are basicaly the same way easy as pie. Powering up your weapons take forever in fact you nearly through the end of the game before you can have enough red ORBS save up to power your weapons. Story line really sorry too. So if you like action games play the first one plus it is cheaper...and when you play the hard mode it is really a hard mode.
4,devil may cry 2,"the game was good but,not really better than the first.it was a little to easy.i only died once in the game.but it is a must by for Dante fans."
3,Devil Does cry,"This game is great when it comes to gameplay, graphics control and sound for a ps2 game. You could say that this game is almost perfect, except for the fact that their is one mistake. This mistake is huge. You could leave this game to a five year and he\she would beat it in about 5 hours. The gameplay is amazing but this game is so easy that you will cry your ... off at the end about how much of a rental this game should be. RENT IT its ot worth buying. UNLESS YOU GET THE USED PERSON FOR LESS MONEy"
1,what the heck?,"Good lord, Capcom, what were you thinking when you released DMC2? I can't believe how dumb someone could be. Almost everything sucks, Dante isn't very hardcore anymore, the levels are too open(you can use guns to beat the game, seriously), it's too dang easy, and it's too dang stupid for it's own good. Capcom should be tortured for this. Devil May Cry 3 WILL be better than this. Believe me, I'm a big DMC freak."
3,Not too bad,The moves are cool. The paths of both the characters are similar. Easy. Unlimitted ammo rocks! The graphics are dated and aren't detailed. The story is bad. It is pretty short.
3,What a disappointment,"In the spirit of the game's playing time, I'll be short. The game was action-packed, for sure, and it had some neat weapons. It was visually stunning as well. But all in all, it was too short and too easy. Anybody beating DMC on ""Dante Must Die"" mode will find the game pretty easy -- this includes the level difficulty as well as the toughness of enemies. Because it was so easy, I had the game beat in no time, and not because I was racing through each mission to get an 'S' rank. It seems that DMC2 dropped the ball. It just wasn't enough to sink my teeth into -- not to mention that I was really hoping with an epic round 2 with Mundus =/"
2,STICK TO THE FIRST!,"This game is one of the reasons why I don't even own a PS2 anymore so jus hear me out for a minute! When the first came out I bought a copy and I was lucky to find out that the first game had alot to do and the physics of the fighting moves you unleash on enemies was fantastiv but this game was a total BLAARGH! First off the graphics look worse than the first! It has only been proved with PS2 that they have some out of date game engines that they recycle for PS2 games! Thus making the game just look like a horrible demo. I don't like this game, in my opinion just concentrate on the first!"
2,Very Dissapointed,"Not even close to the original Devil May Cry, this one really lacks story. After you beat the game (which took me 3 days, not even playing it alot during that time) you'll be thinking ""that's it""? The camera angels pretty much suck, that seems to be one of the main problems with all of the DMC games though. I should've waited till this dropped to $20 but I liked the first one so much I figured it would be worth the $50 but it wasn't. This is definately a prime example of a game not worth the hype."
4,story [bad],"this game would awesome if it was made by the same team that made the original (resident evil team) DMC. the storys messed up, lucia's voice is a wierd foriegn accent, trish isnt in the story line, he doesnt get the ultra cool alastor found in the first one, and the end battle you dont get to change into his sparda form. besides that its pretty good."
1,This game sucks,"Dont waste your money this game sucks. I recently purchased this game. Sure the graphics might be nice ,but wheres the story. All that ever happens is you run around killing demons.Also this game is way to easy run shoot kill run again ,and again. Theres horrible camra angles half the time you cant see your self or the thing you supposed to kill."
4,Devil May Cry 2,"Devil May Cry 2 is definitely one of the best games of 2003 .It has great graphics ,sound , and gameplay .I would have given it a 5 out of 5 ,but the camera angels are practically horrible and I mean horrible .The first Devil May Cry had superb graphics and camera angels ,but in Devil May cry 2 about 40% of the game you don't see where you're going .For example in the beginning in one part I could see something that I wanted to get ,but when I got there I had to move around corners till I finally found it .But overall Devil May Cry 2 is a great game .Capcom could've done much better specially after the first Devil May Cry .If you've played the first Devil May Cry (like me) you must buy this game ,but if you haven't played it and don't know if you really want it or not ,don't go for it ."
4,lame,some of the bosses in the game are just lame...you fight a building..how lame is that...looks like somebody ran outta ideas...you also have to fight a retarded helicopter and some tanks...thing is they are infected...oh how scary is that...LAME
1,Boring,"DM2 is probably the worst, most boring, game for the PS2. Bassicly all you do is run down a level, shoot Identical monsters that have the AI of a dead goldfish, solve stupid puzzles that dont make sense, repeat until the credits roll. Although you have infinate ammo, which may sound like a good thing, is really stupid because you have two hand guns with the power of an AK-47. Your enemys can hardly touch you because you are ""Too"" fast, strong, and athletic. you are way too strong too have any fun. You can beat a level without a scratch on you. That may sound cool, but it's really boring. Another Part that Disturbed me is On the back of the box it says ""Play as theBad-Ass Dante, Or the Sexy Lucia"". Or something like that.LUCIA ISN'T SEXY!!! She's about as ""SEXY"" As Kelly Osbourne. And thats all I have to say about that..."
2,Yuck.,"If you loved the first DMC, then stay clear of this stinking attempt to gobble up your money on the success of the first. The balance of weapons is off, the difficulty is a joke, and there is no real reason to want to play further than an hour into it. No attention to detail, basically it falls flat on it's face."
4,this gome is good just not what you would expect,"First of all Geoff is a moron, this game is NOT horaml. The game just didn't grow, at all. The game play is the same as dmc1 and the graphics are not top noch. The graphics in the game are better then in some of the cut seens. that doesnt make sence! The combat is still GRAET. An other thing is that the game is way to short of two disc. Its like the diveliper put two discs in for the hell of it. Over all this game is not bad just didnt live up to the expectations. If more time was put in to divelopment This would be one of the solodest game in a long time. If you like CMD1 you will probly like DMC2."
1,This is not Devil May Cry :-(,"I got this game because the first one rocked!!! but this one just doen't feel right. It has no real plot, boring voice acting and it is too short and easy to finish. Over all it still has some good moves but this is no Devil May Cry, Capcom has delivered one really bad sequel to a license with real potencial."
3,It's not a sequel to DMC1,"DMC1 had a great storyline. DMC2 flushes it down the toilet. I gave it 3 stars for the only 3 cool things. Cool new moves, demon form, and controls. That's all. It doesn't have anything to do with DMC1. It's like DMC1 never happened. Oh lord it really sucks. Even though it was fun to shoot in different directions and walk up on walls. I hope they just delete DMC2 and make a real sequel with those 3 things I liked from DMC2."
2,Devil May Cry 2,"Alright game...I bought it when on its release date and liked the graphics...I also liked that it had a differ player in it as well...but the downfall of the game is the graphics of the characters and as in the first DVC game Dante was a better fighter as compared to the second installment of this series....I mean dante cant really do much with his fighing style there isnt really much of it ...He doesnt slash at the monsters like he did in DVC1...It also needs a better storyline, better camera angles, better graphics in the characters, and a better fighting style as to the 1 in DVC1...I think in Devil May Cry 1 dante was much more improved fighter than in this 1...I hope capcom does something better.."
4,nice preview,"tom shear never ceases to impress me. with each release a23 has gotten better and better. binary sounds like it could have been on any of the other albums but it also has a different edge to it. its not necessarily darker or harder but more, well...complex is the best word i can think of. the song seems to be at a higher level then most of his other work. its a great little preview of whats to come. i dont think i did the song or cd justice on this review but if you like a23 or catchy dance music, buy it and listen for yourself, it wont disappoint."
3,Half satisfied,"Hi. I was not totally satisfied with the dvd for, it didn't reflect the details given about the product. I ordered it because of STIR IT UP. But unf ortunately, the video is not in full. Too many interuptions with interviews."
2,Only For Collectors,"This dvd is nothing but interviews, many of them repeated on the second disc, with 30 second clips of live Marley perfomances here and there. I was lucky to only have borrowed it from the library. Had I payed $30+ for it I would have been very upset. Half of the people on the second disc never met Marley. They're mostly music journalists or producers offering their critique of certain songs off the Legend album. If you are a collector of all things Marley this dvd MIGHT appeal to you, but if your looking to learn anything about Bob or see live footage of the legend look elsewhere."
4,Outstanding book,"I'm only about half way through the book, but it is outstanding. Very well written and a fascinating subject."
3,Good book but disappointed,"I enjoyed the first several chapters a great deal, as the author tried hard to use analogies and sometimes humor to present points. But when I got around to Chapter 11, the analogy became extremely confusing (""writing a virus"") and it was very difficult distinguishing what was analogy and what was literal. I quit reading the book after giving up on the chapter. The author was friendly enough to write me back, but didn't understand that the problem was not in trying to learn object oriented programming but rather in figuring out what was meant while using these silly analogies."
2,The book was ok,I happpened to come across this book at a thrift store for $0.50. I did learn a bit from it but it was hard to grasp what it was saying. Didn't actually finish the book. It covered some topics well but covered others pretty weak. Didn'y explain the example programs clearly all the time. Does have some good info. Didn't explain clearly where to compile the programs and where to save the examples. Had to figure that part out with some further internet reasearch. Several of the examples had errors when compiled (I redviewed the example in the book with what i typed in the computer line by line and still there were errors when compiled. Was able to fix and modify a few of them.) My overall recommendation is to find a different book to learn from.
3,Left me wanting more,"I'm an experienced programmer looking to learn Java. This book is okay and I finished it pretty quickly but when I finished it I felt that, while I could write a simple (what else?) calculator, I should immediately go out and buy another book to really learn Java. I can only speak as an experienced programmer -- perhaps this is just the thing for non-programmers. For me, though, it's another trip through Amazon.com's list of Java books to see what book(s) I need to buy now."
4,"Well worth the money, and the 24 hours you put into it!","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept me laughing while I practiced new coding skills. Rogers was able to start with the easiest concepts, and move onto more complex subjects. The book claims to be able to teach someone computer programming, but I wouldn't recommend it for an introduction to programming concepts. However, if you already have programming skills, it's a great book to expand your horizons into the latest and greatest (jury's still out on that) programming language"
3,Not geared towards the practicing therapist,"As a therapist I was looking for practical suggestions to incorporate spirituality with my clients. It wasn't really that kind of book, although it did not claim to be. It was filled with things I've heard before, in school and in church. Might be a good read for someone not in the field."
1,Saved by the prior review,I had been looking at the power tips on the Web and was wondering if it would fit.......
2,"GREAT SHOW, VERY POOR VIDEO","The folks who processed this video package should be embarrassed. First the video AND audio are so poor they are distracting. Second, how dare they stick that damn logo on it! I would hope another outfit would release the series on DVD or a better copy to tape. I would give it a five star rating based on the show. If you are a fan of the series, this issue may still be worth buying unless you can find another release that has better quality."
1,PILOT,"THE SERIES IS GREAT, IF IT IS EVER RELEASED IN A BETTER QUALITY FORMAT I WILL BE SURE TO PURCHASE IT. SOMEBODY SHOULD DO SOME JUSTICE AND MAKE QUALITY RELEASES OF THIS SHOW IM SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WAITING FOR IT!"
5,"Pilot Episode ""Beachhead""","This was the pilot episode of the Invaders known as ""The Beachhead"". There was a total of 43 episodes over a season and a half 1967-68. I am hopefull that all episodes will be released some day. It was a very well produced series by Quinn Martin."
4,Goodtimes video Invaders,"I've not seen these videos, but I still have the GoodTimes first 12 episodes in LP mode and it's pretty bad as well in quality, these look like they're sp and probably look better than mine I'm sure.The whole series is available on vhs in sp under another label and I'm working on finding them and bringing them to Amazon.Thanks folks, enjoy.John"
4,I LOVE THE INVADERS,Well.. funny .. but I have read the reviews below and I always thought this set was a great improvement over the original tape releases.. and my eyes are not the greatest either. I do agree it is a shame you can't get this show in better quality.. but .. since two different and only releases of the first 7 episodes are both not great.. I have to assume they are working from poor original material.. we also have to take into consideration that we are rather spoiled since the release of DVDs.. this show is over 30 years old! Since this series has not been re-release or seen anywhere else in better format.. is is entirely possible that you can't get it in a better clearer format!.. As an avid fan.. these tapes are a great buy.. and something is better than nothing.. I just wish I could get more episodes!
5,Awesome,"I was 10 years old when the series started on TV and it was a long time before I would get out of bed with the lights out. This series was scary, scary, scary to me and my sister. I wish they would bring back the whole series on dvd."
5,Dj Micro creates a good one,"I hadn't heard any of Dj Micro's stuff and when I bought Music Through Me I had no idea what to expect. I listened to the whole cd and I am definatly impressed. I lost myself in the music, not once did I skip a song because they all are good enough to listen to from beginning to end. The entire cd is fast pace and never dull, the perfect type of progressive trance. Every song has it's individual features, and when all the songs are put into place it really works well. I highly recommend this cd, and I am now a fan of Dj Micro."
5,Wow,"DJ Micro has really out done himself. If you are new to this kind of music this cd is great first buy, youll love it. He has become one of my all time favs"
5,Captivating!,"I chose this when I hosted a recent book club meeting, and several members said it was their favorite book that we'd ever discussed. The story was captivating - I continually had to remind myself that it was a true story. It's pretty clear that the author's background is newspaper writing - there's lots of details,sometimes too many - but that adds to the story's realism. I highly recommend it."
5,Bledsoe at his best,"I was in N.C. when the climax of this book occurred (TV stations broke into programming to warn motorists/viewers to avoid certain streets because of the slow moving police chase.) Later, I worked in the newsroom of the Greensboro News & Record when Jerry's account of the murders was published. It captivated the entire piedmont triangle area for a week; no one could stop talking about it. In the newsroom, we knew for certain it would be published in book form long before the contracts were signed - it was that compelling. We kidded each other as to who would be cast in the movie - again, long before the ink had dried on Jerry's book contract.When the book was finally published, it was nothing short of a true crime masterpiece. This is the true crime book with which to judge all others. Jerry is a masterful writer, a spinner of tales, a good old boy in the finest southern sense.Buy the book. You won't regret it."
4,Bitter Blood,This amazing book is based on a true story. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed the book very much.
4,These people are nuts!,It is surprising to find out how many people across the USA are crazy. The author told this story without a bias so that we could form our own opinions. That was a plus. The murder cases were first rate and the book was well written. You could really feel for some victims and at the same time want to scream at others in frustration. The only negative is that the author had the tendency to repeat some facts 2-3 times in the book.
4,Many victims in this story but the children.....,"I felt the worst about their murder at the hands of their so-called ""mother"" and the psycho she was involved with, her own cousin.Susie Lynch could have benefitted immensely from a good thrashing when she was still young enough for it to do any good. What a spoiled, self-centered brat. And Fritz Klenner - I can't understand how anyone could call him anything other than what he was - a head case!It's a shame two young boys had to die...along with countless other innocent people....because two sociopaths who couldn't handle the real world and reality decided they were in the way."
2,Bitter Blood,Bitter Blood is an excellent book. Well written true murder mystery that happened in western North Carolina by Jerry Bledsoe. The book held my attention from the moment i started reading it. I found it very hard to put it down. I wanted to keep reading to see what was going to happen next to these very troubled and disturbed families.
3,Bitter Blood,"Was told it was a classic in the true murder genre. I felt it was ok, did not care for the writing style"
4,good book,A very interesting look into a highly dysfunctional family. Highly recommend to those who enjoy true crime novels.
1,Knockoff,"I thought I had ordered a genuine Aqua UV bulb and recieved a cheap knockoff. I instantly responded back for a return and failed to recieve a response. I ordered a replacement ""aqua"" bulb, not a replacement ""57 watt"" bulb made by ""creator"", whoever that is."
1,the worst hardcore album ever,"If you are into hardcore music i would not recommend this album. integrity 2000 offers nothing new to the hardcore scene and every song sounds the same. If you want a good hardcaore album i would recommend earth crisis, bad brains, will haven, or gorilla buiscuits."
2,Very unpleasant,i don't like them. they can't play they are really out of tune but the metal they play is not the best but standable. just don't buy it you won't like it or them
2,Just ok,The storyline was good. It was the reason I finished the book. The book was filled with way too much thinking dialogue though. Page after page of repetitive thinking made me skip through a lot of the book and almost five up on it entirely. Really overall I was sorry I bought it. Gave two stars only because of storyline.
4,book,"Your typical romance, but I liked the fact that she was strong and injured and the man saw beyond that."
1,Isn`t The Club Dangerous Enough?,THere is nothing wrong with this type of dance. I am just not interested in this because I can already do it and I do it when ever I am really upset about something so there was no need to buy this. Children do this when ever they can not get something that they want.
3,Lacking,"This recording lacks life, has slow, dragging tempos and certainly lacks the flare and exitement associated with Vivaldi's string concertos."
1,There's better,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This reading is uninspiring, humourless and very tedious. There are better books out there on the subject - buy this one if you've read the rest and really can't sleep at night."
1,Microsoft CRM,There is very little in this book. Don't buy it.P.S. The product isn't ready for prime time either.
1,I've bought this book and have found no interesting,I've bought this book and have found no interesting. Just simple concepts for real dummies. óéí íà
4,Postcards that Pug owners can relate to,"This book will be enjoyed by all dog owners, but particularly by those who own Pugs. Mr. Maggitti captures the playfullness, stubborness and endearing qualities of our furry Pug friends. The book is a compilation of stories about the authors' adventures as a Pug owner, which will have you rolling with laughter and nodding your head with understanding. I would highly reccommend reading ""Postcards From the Pug Bus""."
2,missing pages,Well the book came a day or so later than I expected but it came and it came looking new. There was one problem though. This newly looking hardcover bound college book was bound withOUT THREE SECTIONS worth of pages in it!!!! Ridiculously it was the sections I needed that week. They were not ripped out they were just not in the book. Now I know why I got it so cheap but would have liked to have know what I was getting myself into before I ordered the book. Also when I bought it - it was listed as new but it came with a sticker on the side that said used. liars
1,Not as listed.,"The book is in great shape. However, it did not include the WebAssign as described, so I had to buy that separately. Not happy at all."
2,Not What I Thought....,"I was not happy with the quality and the care in packaging before shipment. The fenders are about as sturdy as a soda can. I ordered two of these bikes and all four fenders were very dented and they were crooked once installed on the bike. Both bikes were missing nuts, bolts, etc. needed to put it together. My husband bought a generic new bike for $75 at a large retail store and it is of much better quality than this one by Chrysler. Too much money for the product."
1,I should have listened!!!!,"I read the review of this product but as I have never had anything from Amazon come damaged I did not believe it. My bike that I so anxiously awaited arrived damaged. The box looked like it had been tossed around, the chain quard was bent, the fenders were bent. There was very little packing of the bike, no manual. I am very disappointed!!!!! Next time I will listen to the reviews."
5,Out There!,"Some may not have the courage to listen to this ""mind blowing"" piece of work. Joseph can do it all. He sings like nothing you've ever heard before. His guitar playing is intergalactic. Listen to the lyrics of ""I Ain't Fattenin' No More Frogs For Snakes""...do you get it now? Buy this! I shared it with college friends 30 years ago and they begged to be able to get it in 8 track!Mozart never dreamed of music like this...Joseph is in a league by himself. Thank you for finally letting the CD world hear this."
2,Old Flame Sparks Murder,A high school reunion rekindles an old flame and the sparks lead to murder..You'll be amazed at the culprit. Plot begins to drag at the end.
4,Pleasurable Music,"Pleasure's 1st 2 albums on 1 CD. The music on the 1st is a mix of Funk, Jazz & Rock. The 2nd is experimental & more Jazzy for my liking hence 4 stars. All in all is a must purchase"
1,DO NOT ORDER THE BLUE UNICORN EDITION!!!!!!!,"The Blue Unicorn Edition is an incredibly shoddy book-- an InstaBook. It looks like a printout of an unillustrated web page. To top it off, the author's name is given on the cover as ""Frank L. Baum,"" which showed these people had no idea what they were doing, not to mention it's poorly cut and there are blobs of ink all over the book. I'm going to send it back and exchange it for the Wildside edition. I know their books are good quality, since Phyliis Ann Karr showed me hers from them."
1,compressor died at 2 months,"At 2 months old the compressor quit, parts only warranty after 1 month. It took 2 weeks to get the part, we lost all our food. after the repair it is much louder. I should have bought an american fridge, do not buy this."
5,More than moving home!,"This is an amazing story of a family moving home - in a big way! This family moves to South Africa, and the joys and sadness of a new country, new friends, or not friends, a completely new set of rules to live by. Such an opportunity for a young thirteen year old for personal growth. Can you leave your prejudices behind and grow with her?"
2,Republication of a good (but old) guide,"Good book, but written in 1979, not 2007. I have the original, and was hoping this would be an update, since it was published recently. But no, this has none of Zelazny's later work, which is what I was looking for. One would think that would be mentioned in the Amazon page!!"
1,Tim Correll's Piranha 2: The Spawing Review,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What's up with the flying piranhas? I can't believe James Cameron directed this turkey when you consider he also directed The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Titanic (which were first rate movies). Lance Henriksen was much better in Scream 3 (a slasher flick directed by Wes Craven) and The Terminator. This sequel is so bad it make other bad sequels (such as Jaws 2, Jaws 3 and maybe even Jaws: The Revenge (big maybe) look good. Skip this loser of a movie unless you find the concept of flying piranhas either scary, funny or both."
2,"Fair early effort for James Cameron(Terminator 2,Titanic)","Piranha 2 is one of James Cameron's earliest efforts.The story is about flying killer fish,how stupid is that? I guess this is a decent time waster if you don't have anything elso to do. Hell I'd rather watch this than Cameron's huge hit Titanic.If you're into cheesey 80's horror flicks check this out,others beware!"
3,OK.We all know this kinda sucks.IT'S STILL WORTH WATCHING!!!,"...this was not as good as it's 78 original movie. .... OK, you wanna know the plot? I'll tell ya. There's a mutated strin of piranha in the water AND in THE AIR! That's right. THEY CAN FLY! We're gonna need a bigger rod! I like when the nurse shoos the two main c's(characters) out of the morgue. Then the gory body corpse is shown. Then, a piranha pops out and heads for the nurse's throat. He brutally tore it up! ..."
2,What A Flying Piece Of Crap!,"Wow...my head literally hurts after this movie. I LOVE the original! This one is so bad! First off, there is no character development. Second, there are just so many unnecessary scenes and so much unnecessary dialogue. Third, we don't even see a piranha fly until 40 minutes into it! Fourth, the big fish-fry-at-night-on-the-beach scene is SO anti-climatic! That is supposed to be the ""big scene""! How did James Cameron ever work again after this? Apparently, whoever thought up this idea had no idea that actual ""flying fish"" jump up into the air and need to land into water again to survive. Actual ""flying fish"" are still fish and can't survive out of water. If you see this movie, you know why I say that. There is a plus, that many of the guys wear tight short shorts of tiny bathing suits. In fact, in the opening scene, the guy has an actual half-chub, ha. Overall, if you enjoy the original, don't watch this. Save your money! It's not nearly as cool as it seems."
2,Not the best sequel but still a cult classic,"Definitely not a good sequel, but it has it's moments. I have Piranha so I had to buy the sequel."
1,"Um, please! Duh!","Ha ha. Very funny. Unless you like flying piranhas, this is one poor, stupid zero. Duh."
2,James Cameron Made What?,"Thats right. This poor excuse for a film was made by mr. avatar himself. Its no wonder why the man never mentions the film in public because this thing is horrible. If you want to see fish fly and destroy people, than this is the movie for you. But just remember, its freaking boring. The only thing that could of saved the feature, is a commentary by Cameron, but no dice. That will never come."
2,2 1/2 stars for the movie that spawned director James Cameron,"This forgotten sequel is best remembered as the first movie James Cameron directed. Based on his own account however, he was fired after only a couple weeks yet his name remains on the credits. The opening underwater sequence I'm sure is his work. It is suspenseful and scary. There are other effective scenes, but the patchwork of the product is pretty bad. Bad writing and acting doesn't help. Only Lance Henriksen is any good. The Italian producers put out a movie that tries hard to find the teen age audience. There are a few boobies, a little blood and gore, some comedic relief and lousy special effects. It's a stinker but not quite unwatchable."
4,Good product but doesn't work with all USB to serial adapters,Unlike the other reviewer I could not get the M9803R to collect data when using a USB to serial port adapter. It did not work with a Serial Gear USB to 2 port serial adapter. But when used with a PC with a built in COM port it worked as advertised. Hence if you are having problems collecting data when using a USB to serial adapter suspect the problem is caused by an incompatibility between the DMM View software and the USB to serial adapter.
3,"Good meter, weak manual, worthless test leads","The meter its self appears to rate about 5 stars.The manual is short on some specifics. The worst area is the RS232 output.The meter leads almost had me ready to box it up and send it back. They didn't make contact with the meter. As a result when I went to do a quick check that it would measure a resistor, it simply showed open circuit. Somebody sure saved a lot of money on those leads. If you buy this meter buy some leads that have real banana plugs on the meter end or buy some good bananas and retrofit the leads. As they stand, the leads can't be used.I found the source code from someone who figured out the weird RS-232 format. Don't expect just ASCII numbers directly from the meter. It is a funny unpacked BCD format at 9600 BAUD."
1,Cancer,I bought and watched these movies and the next day was diagnosed with cancer. Coincidence? I think not!
1,Horrible,"[...]. Not fun, not a good plot, too hard for children. It is a scooter spin-off of Tony Hawk. All you do is ride around on a scooter and try to do tricks over skeletons. Nothing else. Not fun for you or any one else in your family."
2,Interesting Voice,"I seem to be in the minority since the other reviewers loved this disc. While I like Gauthier's low, twangy voice, some of the songs, such as, Sugar Cane and Merry Go Round are too similar to Lucinda Williams work. Other songs stand out (Walk Through the Fire, The Ledge, For Rose) Gauthier is a good story teller. It's a slow paced, brooding collection of songs. The similarities to Williams interfered with my enjoyment. After reading the other reviews I was excited to receive this and ended up being disappointed."
4,"A strong, sad alt.country album","A super-mournful, entropy-ridden set of alt.country sadcore, heavily laced with themes of ruefullness and thwarted redemption. With Gauthier's connection to Gurf Morlix (he produced and played on this album) I made the inevitable Lucinda Williams comparison, then found my thoughts drifting to the similarly mopey, spiritually-inclined Canadian folksinger, Ferron, and finally was able to hear Gauthier as her own artistic voice. She's pretty downerific, and the religious bent of this album can also be a little offputting (Gauthier's not so much proselytizing as lamenting her own perpetual fall from grace, also potentially alienating for the casual listener...) However, her songs are well-crafted: fans of the late Townes Van Zandt will probably find a lot to cheer about here. Good stuff, kinda high-concept and forlorn, but gritty, engaging and intelligent as well."
2,Couldn't get past the personalities,"I can't put my finger on it, but I found Kosminsky and Hurt so annoyingly bland and mellow that I couldn't finish the DVD. I think if you combined them, you might come up with one real personality."
5,Superb!,"I am a Yoga instructor, Consultant, and Shaman.This book is easy to follow, has great content, and good illustrations.If you are looking for a Ki-Kou book, this is very good. It focuses on many diseases.The only secret is, you have to do it. There is no pill to fix your problems.If you have questions or doubts, allow me to tell you: This is real and it works!Give it a try with intention."
3,Difficult to learn with bad drawings,I was not happy with the illustrations and directions to do the exercises in this book. I would skip buying this manual if I was you.
1,Not what I expected,"I had expected the book to describe breathing techniques that would promote general health and wellbeing.It does provide warm up and cool down exercises that should be done at the start and end of every session. Apart from these, all of the techniques relate to specific conditions, for example obesity, fatigue during kidney dialysis, and gout.The book is well laid out, and the drawings and instructions are clear.If you have one of the conditions that this book deals with you might find it helpful. You might want this book if you are interested in the use of breathing techniques as an alternative or complementary therapy.I found the product description misleading, and this book is not what I was looking for."
2,healing with Ki-Kou,"Healing with Ki-Kou: The Secret of Ancient Chinese Breathing Techniques by Li Xiang - 156 PagesIs not what I expected from the description, I thought it would be more informitave"
3,Promising beginning...,"...but after the first two novels (Fast Forward and Double Take), I was disappointed and bored with part 3 (Split Image) and part 4 (Blind Spot).Judy Mercer must have felt the same as she never wrote a 5th part and obviously gave up on the series.I recommend to read anything by Carlene Thompson, Mary Higgins Clark, Marjorie Dorner or Patricia MacDonald instead."
5,Fast Forward-Judy Mercer,1st novel of Ariel Gold series of 4 novels......excellent mystery.........could not put it down.....highly recommend to lovers of good mystery books!
3,Engaging Plot,"While the plot is engaging and the suspense keeps you hanging onto the edge of your seat, Fast Forward is a worthy first book from an author & to a series.Ariel Gold wakes up with no memory. We watch as she tries to piece together her life, and figure out what happened that put her in this position to begin with. At just over 330 pages it seems we wait forever through mysterious discoveries, budding friendships, interesting personal revelations until the end. Just when I was starting to get antsy for the end, the story really pulled me in & finished strong.I am looking forward to reading the next novel in this series, and I'm betting I will even enjoy it a bit more than this one- as some of this book got tedius with character development that might not boggle down the next book."
4,"Good job,Ms.Mercer !",I feel Judy Mercer did a very good job on her first book. The amnesia story line was very believable and kept you in suspense as to how it happened until the end. I'm looking forward to her next book.
2,"hmm... well, if u REALLY need a book for an airplane flight","one of those novels you can read at the beach, but i wouldn't call it memorable. it's in the murder mystery genre, with an amnesiac for the protagonist. fast reading, perfect for a plane trip. the fast read contrasts with the denouement (where you finally learn who's who in the tangled plot). It was like driving at 90 mph and then having to lurch to 30mph to avoid some deer. some people might find that exciting. i found it a little annoying."
5,Fast Forward is Right!,"This is the kind of book you read quickly, because nowhere seems a good place to stop. There are too many intriguing questions waiting to be answered. Yes, there are some potentially implausible turns and amnesia is always a tough sell, but those factors only demonstrate what a terrific story-teller Mercer is. I raced merrily through the pages (with my suspended disbelief stumbling along behind), eager to find out what was really going on. A fun read."
3,Overcoming Alcoholism an issue for many,"This book is about Lacey and Randy. They work next door to each other at the mall and begin dating soon after meeting. Soon, we learn that both have been affected by alcoholism, either by personal experience or through family. This seems to be the main issue that the book addresses. Randy often has a lot to say at once, either alcoholism facts or topics in general to change a subject of conversation. Lacey works to find trust in Randy, as well as to support her sister, who's husband is an alcoholic."
5,3X Jumbo Pill Box,Pill Box 3x JumboLargest one I've found. Roomy and organized. This is a great product for anyone with lots of pills or vitamins to take on a weekly basis.
1,Too big,"The picture is deceiving, this thing is HUGE!Unless you want to bring your lunch and desert along with your vitamins skip this product."
1,The Compartment Lids Frequently Open!,"This pill caddy seems like a great buy.It is relatively compact.For clarity, the caddy lists the individual days of the week.However, a MAJOR problem with this type of pill caddy is that the caddy's compartment lids frequently open inside of a bag. Resultantly, all of the pills - in that particular compartment - spill out.I do not think that it is a good idea to mix all of a person's pills, for the entire day, into one compartment...such as Monday, Tuesday, etc. Ingredients and dyes can rub off onto other tablets or pills.I have decided to replace this style of pill caddy with a pill caddy that provides many more individual compartments - so that each pill or vitamin can remain isolated."
2,EZY Dose Jumbo Weekly Pill Reminder 3XL,I had bought this as a stocking stuffer for my mom for Chrisstmas but I found that this pill case was a litte bit too large to carry around in a purse.
4,Really big!,"We don't really take this many prescriptions, but we were tired of cramming our vitamins nd supplements into smaller pill minders with our prescription meds. This is really big, but we le it"
2,Very hard to open,"While it is exactly what it looks like (A large box with seven compartments and daily labels), it is very difficult to open. There is only the tiniest sliver of plastic to push up to open one of the compartments, and it locks very tightly. I have full dexterity and I often resort to opening it with my teeth. I would expect that kind of clasp on something that will go in a backpack, not something for around the house. If you want something 'child-proof' then this is good, but if it's just for personal use then find something easier to open."
5,good storage,"Arrived promptly as described, works fine. I needed eleven more word to be able to post, so here they are"
4,Great Case,"I have gotten these in the past. This one was by far the cheapest (thanks to the add-on buy feature). I am happy with it as it is the same as the ones I have had previously. However, the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it does not come with the locking mechanism.Still great for what I need it for.Bottom line: If you take a lot of pills/vitamins and don't need to travel with it, this case is perfect."
5,Finally - one large enough for all the vitamins & stuff I take!,"I take a bunch of different vitamins, supplements, medications, etc. I was always having to squish them into other vitamin packs. This one has the space, is clearly marked, has firmly snapping lids but easy to open. Working Great. Love it."
1,"Exactly what does ""JUMBO"" mean??",The title of this item is deceiving. It isn't much bigger than the average size pill holder. I was looking for something large and this didn't hold but about two thirds of my daily suppliments. The seller could be more forthcoming about the actual size by adding something in the product picture to give the pill container some scale.
4,Best purchase ever for senior pill-takers!,"We are senior citizen mega-pill-takers who used to sometimes forget whether or not we took our pills that day. Our daily routine used to mean opening 10 to 15 bottles, counting out the pills, putting bottles back, etc. Time-consuming, off-putting, boring. Now,once a week we fill the roomy compartments with our daily dosages, AND we know for sure whether we took the pills that day because each compartment is marked. Only drawback. Individual lids have to be secured tightly, or pills may drop out unexpectedly when you remove daily doses. But not a serious complaint."
3,it's fine,"This is a bare-bones pill container, it lacks any of the nice features that other pill holders have. It does not divide AM and PM pills, does not use color coding, and it is not portable. I could fit about 15 large pills in each day, but if you only need capacity for 8 large pills or fewer, I recommend the Apex Pocket Med Pack because it is portable and better organized."
3,BIg but does the job,The pill box is good for travel but it can't fit in my purse so I can't use it for daily use.
2,"Pretty good size, DOESN'T LOCK","Measurements are approx 9 inches long.This one DOESN'T LOCK. I have an old version of the same thing, and it is very hard to open with your hands, yet seems to fall open by itself in your bag. So annoying. Skip this one and get the locking one for fifty cents more."
5,big pill box good for big vitamins,If you need a big pill box that holds lots of vitamins supplements etc you will like this.
4,"Not Kidding on the ""Jumbo""","I purchased this as an easy reminder to take the few pills I take in a day. Apparently I must have missed the ""jumbo"" description because each day can probably fit an entire bottle of pills depending on the size of the pill! It's a nice, sturdy product and if you need to stay organized and take a good amount of pills or just a few really large ones..this is the pill box to get!"
2,HUGE!,I can't imagine how many pills any single human being could possibly take that would necessitate a dispenser with compartments this big.
2,needs tighter doors,"I am impressed with the size of this thing as it has a huge capacity, the problem is with the doors. If you have the compartments filled with pills the doors can open up unexpectedly making a mess of your meds."
5,I purchased three of the,3XL size because I am on a lot of different medications and these have room left over. I am so glad EZY Dose came out with these huge pill minders.
4,A Definitive History,"As a former student of Dr. Smylie, I can attest to his passion for history, in particular the history of the Presbyterian Church in all its forms. With words and pictures, A Brief History helps us understand the foundations of our denomination. It is an invaluable tool for teaching and explaining our journey in the waters in the Reformed Tradition."
2,Angel in the house becomes a little devil,"I hated this adaptation of the book because they got it wrong, wrong, wrong. Braddon created the perfect Victorian heroine in her novel and deliberately turned her into a murdering gold digging bigamist who must have made her readership look at every golden haired ray of domestic sunshine with suspicious eyes. Where on earth did the tall, brunette, ... Lady Audley of this production come from? We should have had Donna Reed, not Theda Bara. What's left to subvert? If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the laboured comment on the repressed Victorian woman. If you have, you'll miss all the wickedly delightful toying with Victorian stereotypes that was Braddon's strength."
4,Lady Audley's not such a secret,"Well, even though you are aware what Lady Audley's Secret it through almost all of the movie, this is not a terrible video. I liked the costumes and the plot. I think that the acting was pretty good but not wonderful. I am a huge movie buff and I love anything with good costumes, but I remebered this movie more than some of the other ones I have seen recently.Before becomming Lady Audley, our character is the governess to a rich man, Mr. Audley's daughter. He proposes and she accepts. They seem happy at first until Mr. Audley's son returns home and falls in love with Lady Audley, and she sort of with him. She is obviously covering something up, and the son wants to find out what it is.I enjoyed this movie and felt my time and money were well spent."
1,"Lady Audley, not Cousin Rachel","This program was SUPPOSED to be based on Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, not Daphne du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel, but it seems to resemble du Maurier's work. A man goes after a woman not so much because she is a murderer, but because she doesn't return his love. Braddon's book wasn't like that! Robert is a far more sympathetic character in the book, really struggling to make the right decision, and Alicia does not like Lucy at all. I understand that the person who developed this for TV sympathized with Lucy's character more than Braddon did, but this person changed the story too much. And the book's ending was much happier. A real disappointment!"
2,Angel in the house becomes a little devil,"I hated this adaptation of the book because they got it wrong, wrong, wrong. Braddon created the perfect Victorian heroine in her novel and deliberately turned her into a murdering gold digging bigamist who must have made her readership look at every golden haired ray of domestic sunshine with suspicious eyes. Where on earth did the tall, brunette, sexually lethal Lady Audley of this production come from? We should have had Donna Reed, not Theda Bara. What's left to subvert? If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the laboured comment on the repressed Victorian woman. If you have, you'll miss all the wickedly delightful toying with Victorian stereotypes that was Braddon's strength."
5,One of the best titles on Mesoamerican spirituality!,"This book breaks down the complicated system of Maya spirituality into a very understandable and readable format. Archeological evidence of the belief system is covered, along with a wonderful analysis based on comparisons with other beleif systems and Jungian depth psychology. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality, psychology, and/or the Maya culture."
5,Excellent,Excellent and insighful. This book provides information I have not found elsewhere about the ancient Maya civilization. The author provides many interesting insights into Mayan religion. Highly recommended.
2,a Bland try,"The material as shown in this book is very bland. Many of the photos show the windows against various white backgrounds with varying degrees of success. The originals are so very exciting that these reproductions take all the wind out of them. There are occasional drawings of these designs that are so small to make them nearly useless.The title of the book is interesting because so few of the stained glass (or more correctly art glass) works of FLW were ""leaded."" Most used a Came (the proper word for the metal used to hold the glass in place) was other than lead, copper, zinc and brass were used according to the other books on this subject.The graphic design of the book is also scattered and needs help. This is too bad because of the other fine work on Wright's glass published before this. One would have hoped that this book would have made an advance based on the earlier work. Check out the others."
2,High quality but does not work for me,"It is small like everyone says it is, It is very well made,and it is the perfect small case for a traditional round tube body. Problem is my bike is hydro-form aluminum and it just does not fit not even a little. A complete waste of money. This is not the kind of bag you should buy without trying first."
2,Ok for small items more like a shoulder pad,"I was disappointed with this Axiom bag as far as the size and the fact that most of it is taken up by the shoulder pad. The shoulder pad serves the purpose of carrying a bicycle. However, such would have to be a rather lightweight bicycle.While the idea is good, the execution is not. The bag is so small it barely holds anything. Another issue is the design is more for a straight not angled top tube.The bag fits the best on a straight top tube geometry."
2,takes up too much space for so little storage,"For the space required to mount this thing, it only fits a couple of wallets. and maybe keys. If you have a need for more storage, go with the seat mounted packs."
1,Not worth your money!!!!,"I bought this mp3 player as a gift for someone, but it arrived 2 weeks late. So I decided to keep it & began to download songs. It would not read 1/2 of the songs that downloaded. I then tried using the cd that came with it, hoping that it might help, but the cd rom had NO DATA....? Who would sell something with faulty software? I then began to charge the mp3 player, when it was done i unplugged the charger & the prung that goes into the outlet came off as I pulled it out, it was not yanked out it softly pulled it out & it broke. This company is selling faulty products that are not worth anyones hard earned money. I ended up going to Target to purchase a name brand item worth just as much money but really works."
1,ION 1GB MP3/MP4 Player,"The CD that accompanied the player that I bought contains 4-5 zip files which are supposedly instructions translated into different languages, but all of the files are corrupted, and cannot be loaded onto the player or opened on the computer. The User's Manual that comes with the player is written in broken English and the key operating instructions in the Manual are the ones reduced to size 3-4 font, which I had to use a magnifying glass to read. The Manual instructions are not very helpful as far as getting the player to record or for managing files. There is no warranty. However, I found this to not be a total waste after all. The player can be programmed through Windows Media Player. Barring initial frustration, this turned out to be an okay deal."
4,Bueno para ninos,"Ideal para el aprendisaje de los ninos, asi podran tener su propia biblioteca de musica"
3,"Fun toy, too loud","My son likes the keychain, fun sounds, but the volume is extra loud! I would like this toy more if there was a way for him to turn the volume down. We always have to ask him to stop playing with it. But the sounds are great!"
3,Mario Keychain,Got this for my son's birthday. He hasn't played with it much. Can't control the volume of course. Sounds will take you back to the days when you played this game as a kid. I wish we brought it with us on Halloween to enhance his Mario costume.
4,Mario sounds,I bought this for my 3 year old son. He loves the Super Mario Brothers games. I first saw it in a Hot Topic but didn't buy it. Regreting not getting it I looked forever online to try and find one with free shipping because it is $10 alone just for a keychain that makes sounds. I finally found one on amazon and when I gave it to my son he loved it. Now thats all I hear through out the house.
5,Very cute,I bought this for my son who is dressing up as Mario for Halloween this year. it works great and is perfect for all the little Mario fans out there.
4,A wounderful book,"This book was wounderfully written. The poems give good detail, and will paint vivid pictures in your head."
1,worst than 007 for n64,this a horrible game. theres more bad stuf in the game than good.first off i did think that being able grab people as hostages was great.i also liked that he was alowed to say [profane words]. but if you ever notice most people face look the same in this game. also if you ever shoot at a window it doesnt break no sound nothing. the graphics are horrible they look like n64 graphics. and in some parts of the game u have to go jumping off edges and stuf com on thisis a shooting game not and adventure. also you cant really explore or go in another direction its just one way. everythings scripted and the peolpe know your here right away. like they know your supposed to go that way. the frame rate in the game is excelent cause the graphics [are bad]. and for a game that has great frame rate they should of atleast put a multiplayer like 007 cause its smoothe like this game. but they didnt. justsave your money its not worth it.
5,Best First Person Shooter,This game is gonna rock Nintendo Gamecube. This I personly think this is better than James Bond even though I didn't yet get my hands on Nightfire. First person shooters are great. I'm a big fan of first person shooter. If you like James Bond and Metroid Prime you will go crazy for this game!
4,Too much swearing!,This is a great game.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they always swear!Other than that it is a great game
4,rating of a 13 year old gamer,"I have recently bought this game and have been mostly satisfied. I gave this game a 4 because some of the levels are quite challenging. In particular I had trouble with the tuna level just as another gamer has. As of [date]. I have still not beat it. I also gave this game a 4 because it has strong language using evrey word in the book. If you are a parent you might want to consider this. Over all, I thought this was a great game but the auto aim can be annoying when you are trying to take out 1 guy that has a gun to a hostage and take out his partner thus making the 1 with the gun panic and shoot the hostage."
3,Good Alternative-Don't Care for the Organic Mumbo Jumbo,"Annie's Natural Shells are a good alternative to the pasty white flour Kraft Mac & Cheese. Flavor is good for boxed Mac & Cheese when you just want something quick and easy, although the white cheddar is not my favorite flavor of Annie's. Kids will not know the difference.What I really don't care for is all of their organic and the ""I'm saving the Earth so I'm a better person for buying this product"" mumbo jumbo. There are those of us that just want healthy alternatives without all of the being green political correctness.The fact is that the dairy products that Annie's uses come from cows that eventually end up in a saluter house. ""How nice is that Mr. Rabbit?"""
3,More Cheese Please,"Taste is fine. However, if you follow directions exactly it tends to be a bit watery with less cheese than expected. We add a half cup of shredded cheddar to get consistency we want."
2,Flavorless,"It is not terrible by any means, but it has basically no flavor. Definitely the worst boxed macaroni and cheese I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and make your own mac and cheese. It is not very time consuming and tastes so much better than anything you will ever buy in a box."
2,"Bland, bland, bland!","I like all kinds of mac and cheese. My homemade version uses cream, Beecher's cheese and Dungeness crab. But then on the other hand, I also like both Stouffer's and Trader Joe's frozen, and I even like the stuff in the ""blue box."" Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today. I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland. I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor. Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out. Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money. Even Easy Mac is better."
4,Good Comfort Food,"Tasty...a better bargain than at the store....although the recipe is not quite as forgiving, I've found. I usually don't measure the milk in other mac/cheese..it's just a little creamier. This one gets watery quickly with too much milk and the cheese doesn't dissolve very well. The flavor is great though, and I won't be buying Kraft again anytime soon."
2,"pasta is okay, but sauce was flavorless","I agree with the other reviewer who called this bland. While eating this, it seemed like I was eating boiled noodles with a little milk poured on top. I couldn't taste ANY cheese flavor.For those who don't want to make their own mac & cheese, basically ANY brand of frozen mac & cheese is better than this box mix -- and most frozen mac & cheese meals aren't very good, either. Best pre-prepared mac & cheese: a tie between Amy's (VERY strong cheese flavor) and Trader Joe's ""reduced guilt"" (you can tell there's real cheese in it, though the cheese they use isn't as sharp as I'd like). Yes, both of these are more expensive than this box mix, but if you're willing to eat this stuff you really should just buy your pasta separately and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top; you'll save money and at least you'll get some cheese flavor."
3,tried it due to kroger $.50 sale to see if I should buy 10...,"And it was pretty meh. Priced at $1 per box at kroger, this week if you buy 10 you get $5 off so it would be $.50 a box. I was hoping it would taste great! But the less then positive reviews were right, against the hype. I do like that its natural and organic...but it needs way more cheese! Although the shells that had a bit more cheese on them tasted good, the overall taste seemed like I added too much milk, even though I used far less than the recommended 1/4 cup. I give it a meh rating. I would also go so far as to say these should have a regular price of that $.50 as well, sad to say. I am curious about the other varieties though...sure wish it had more cheese..."
3,Needs something extra,"Don't get me wrong, I love this mac n' cheese. BUT, I think it's really bland without adding anything. When I eat it, I add a can of tuna and mix some parmesan cheese in with the sauce before I mix it with the noodles to make it thicker. This makes the sauce stick better to the noodles."
5,JUST THE BEST,"You cant beat the taste, quality and price (amazon) of this food. Good for any age.We've tried other organic brands and none compare. This is far above the leading chemical based mac and cheese too."
5,tastes great,"follow the suggestion for using yogurt to make it taste tangier. Also I've used sour cream and that's great, too!"
2,Good taste?,I ordered this item due to all the good reviews. We tried it tonight. Both the husband and I agreed: edible. I was very disappointed in this product. But then we never eat the Kraft stuff so maybe we're just picky.
4,pretty good,"the macaroni itself was good - however the cheese mix was a little fake tasting and a little watery. overall a good product, though."
4,The New Standard,"Time was when Kraft macaroni and cheese was the bachelor's best friend. Whether I've changed my tastes as I've gotten older or if they've just crappified the ingredients in that product, the adult me needed something with some real flavor to it. Annie's is the best powder mix product I've found. My teenage son appreciates the higher quality as well.If you buy this on a subscription you get a lower price and free shipping, which makes it far more affordable than it is at the health food store in the next town from me, and they often don't have the standard size box that I prefer."
1,Not a good price on Amazon,"Usually $.99-1.19 at stores here in Colorado. Unless this is a buy for those without Annie's at their grocery stores, this is a bad deal. C'mon Amazon, we buy in bulk to save, not pay the same price!"
1,Overpriced,"Have others noted how overpriced the grocery items are? Even factoring what you would pay with tax, this is just not a good deal. I can purchase Annie's mac and cheese for 1.19 at my local grocery store. This price works out to 1.57 a box. What gives with the high prices???"
3,ACDelco E530C Ignition Coil,Worked great albeit expensive. Fit as advertised and was easy to install. Life is good There is peace in the valley. Happy motoring!
4,A Fan,The negative 5 stars guy sounds like someone who was kicked out of this band back in high school and is now ticked off that they now have a record deal. This album is great and their music is infectious.
5,A major work finally gets it's recording debut.,"Ever since I read a review of the concert where George Crumb's Star Child was premiered I've been hoping that a recording would be forthcoming. In a sense, this is your typical Crumb work, with it's wild vocalise, it's unusual instrumental effects, it's mixture of tonal and atonal elements, and, most of all, it's aura of ritual and mystery. It also breaks new ground in it's scope (a large orchestra used sparingly) and layering of different musics. I particularly love the duet between the soprano and trombone (""Voices Crying in the Wilderness"" indeed!) and the quietly estatic closing, with the strings soaring into their highest range. The guitar work shows a lighter and humorous side of Crumb's art and are a delight, as are the early songs (although there is only a hint of the composer's later style buried in them). Anyone interested in comtemporary music that is both innovative and deeply expressive should check into this disk."
5,Medline Protection Super Plus!,They are the very best protection underwear on the market! I know because I have compared!My experience followed serious surgery.
4,Definately worth a try,I adopted a grown cat that turned out to have litter issues. He pooped or peed anywhere except the litter. We tried all kinds of things to help. This was my last resort. It seems that he has stopped peeing around since I started using the litter. Unfortunately though he still poops anywhere else except the litter. But I am real glad to have him peeing in the litter!! I hear that lots of people swear by this product.
3,not working,"my cat will not use it all the time,still wetting on carpet,going to try keeping her in one room until she starts using litter,they said to try this in book that was sent."
5,finally found something,"I've tried behavior modification, diffusers, etc., but this product was the first thing that made an appreciable difference. My 17 year old cat had a bad habit of peeing on my daughter's bed in the early morning. I was washing sheets once or twice per day, but since using this product for the last three weeks, we've only had two incidents. What a change! I'm not saying other things don't help, but this liter made a HUGE difference and probably kept us from putting the cat down."
3,time will tell,"I liked Dr. Elsey's cat litter for a while, not too much dust, clumped well. But after a few months, I noticed the room where we had the box had a bad odor all the time. I had to wash the litter box more often because the odor wasn't being controlled by the clay as much as I thought, and was permeating the plastic instead. It is a good product, but I switched back to Tidy Cat Instant Action because it has excellent clumping and odor controlling qualities."
4,I made the best of a bad situation,"I had a 9 year-old neutered male who began peeing and pooping all around the house. I changed litter from Tidy Cat Scoop to this brand earlier this year. He occasionally leaves me a few ""tootsie rolls"" next to his litter box, but he never soils other areas of the house since I switched to this brand. The litter clumps very well, too, and keeps odors to a minimum."
1,Copywritten Inconveince,"Here I sit in my DJ room typing on a computer instead of watching this CD all because it's won't play on either of my laptops. As someone who plays most of his DVDs on laptops, this is simply too much of an inconvenience. I still look forward to watching the DVDs when I get around to sitting in front of an actual TV with an actual DVD player, but I won't be recommending the series to anyone."
2,Not worth it,"This is in no way, shape or form a work-out video. It is not an instructional video. It is a bunch of guys talking to the camera, explaining their motivation for krumping, and dogging those they don't like (namely, clowns.) I learned NOTHING from this video. But the ""don't""s section was mildly entertaining. Certainly not worth the price of the DVD, but I got a good laugh out of it.Of course, I can see that pretty much anywhere, so there you have it."
3,Tryna get Krump'd,"I bought this dvd after watching the documentary Rize. I wanted to teach my kids (a dance program Im starting) a little of the basics and then watch them get ""Buck"". I think it's basically your own style but the dvd teaches you the basics the do's and don'ts. I look forward to purchasing the other dvd's as well."
3,"Not a Great Movie, but entertaining","Wasn't quit as good as I thought it would be, but was still entertaining. Would not be amoung my favorites"
3,No Bubble Wrap!?!,"I received this item in a timely fashion, but there was nothing to protect the item in its shipping box. Even some newspaper would have been nice. There does not appear to be any damage though. Oh, and the model kit box was not sealed either, as stated in the product description. The box had been opened, it appears that everything is in there, I'll find out when I put the kit together."
4,Very Interesting & Creative,"I thought this book was very creative & interesting...from more than one perspective. The protagonist of the story, Melanie Langdon, falls asleep on the Victorian sofa sometime in the 1950's and she wakes up as Milly Baines in the 1860's. She struggles to get back to the life she had as Melanie Langdon because, not only is it a much better life, but it's the only life she can remember. She has no idea what is going on in her life as Milly Baines...as she can do is piece together pieces of ""the puzzle"" by listening carefully to what everybody is talking about and trying to figure out who she is. Bits and pieces of both lives (Melanie's & Milly's) seem real and familiar, making it almost impossible for her to distinguish whether she is trying to get back to a dream that doesn't exist or whether she is trying to escape a nightmare that isn't hers."
4,Entertaining mystery,"This is the first book I have read by Carol Higgins Clark and I really enjoyed it. Regan is a delightful character. Although Ms. Clark lets you in on some of what the ""bad"" guys are up to, there are still some surprises at the end!"
5,Carol is not her mother,I think these people have written very nasty reviews. Carol is not her mother. She doesn't write the same kind of books as her mother.She has her own style & her book are all good.Carol I think you are a good author.I have everyone of her books & have injoyed all of them.
4,Nothing gets old in this series!!!,I have read most of the series of Regan Reily. They are all wonderfully written and grab your attention. I cant put them down.
3,ICED left me a bit cold.,I have read most of the Regan Reilly series. I have to say that they are beginning to sound very familiar - just a new location with another long list of characters. This series is an easy read.
4,Great book!!!!!!!!,"I really liked this book. But I have to admit she's not as good as her mother, Mary Higgins Clark."
3,"Definitely not great literature, but fun nonetheless.","I was given this book several years ago and just read it recently.Yes, it is predictable and far from great literature; yet I found it to be fun. I think ""movie of the week"" is a perfect description. Sometimes you just need a simple, predictable story to escape with. I found this book to be the perfect boring, rainy day companion. A nice break to my usual reads. To me, I found it to be a way to pass the time similar to the Harlequin Romances I read as a pre-teen. A good book to read when the environment is hectic and full of frequent interruptions i.e. while travelling, at the beach, on the bus, in a house full of very young children. I would read more books by Carol Higgins Clark."
1,"A trio of blind, syphilitic baboons slapping at the key board could have written a better text!","I'm not trying to be mean, but ... ARE THEY KIDDING WITH THIS TRIPE?Once one understands the doublespeak of the 4 & 5 star reviews it makes more sense -""This book is charming"" - means my 4-year-old nephew can read it (and probably could have written it better)""A fast-paced read"" - means one cannot read through it fast enough before disposing of properly (preferably in a far-off landfill)""Ms. Clark has definitely improved"" - How could she not? Her previous ""novels"" were so pedestrian, she had no direction to go but improve.""Another Winner"" - Yes, for Carol Higgins Clark. She managed to make another 6-figures off an unsuspecting public.""A light read"" - Speaks for itself. Think about it. Have you ever called a good book ""a light read""? Of course not. That term is reserved for drivel.""A good beach book"" - (See ""a light read"" above)Don't believe the hype, even if it is well-meaning."
1,A Disgrace to Literature,"When you choose to read something that you know will be of the fluff genre you have limited expectations- however, Carol Higgins Clark fails to meet even the lowest standards. She is just awful and painfully transparent. Her writing isn't simple in a charming, thought provoking way but simple, as in dumb. She is incapable of writing anything complex or creative-whether it's a sentance or a plot. Warner Publishing should be embarrassed that they have given this woman a writing contract. If this is the caliber of writing they desire, then they have 6th grade classrooms across the U.S. full of their kind of ""talent"". This book, as well as her others, prove it's WHO you know in this world, not what you WRITE. Whoever bought this book and propelled it to the New York Times Best Seller list should hang their head in shame."
3,Okay-I've Read Better Books But Stuck With It Anyhow,"This book was okay, but I've read better in the past though-that's for sure. It could have been more interesting.Eben Bean had been known as a man who robbed people of their fine art or gems. He was incarcerated for 10 years in prison for getting caught. However, when he was released he was a new man that was reformed and ready to be out.The wealthy Wood family knew they could trust Eben as their caretaker for their mansion; so they hired him on. But when painting were discovered missing, Eben got the blame, when in fact there was a whole different story altogether.Judd and Willohema were up to no good. But Reagan Reilly the PI in the case, had trouble locating the two."
1,"BORING, BORING, and BORING","This book is a dud. The plot is predictable and the characters are stereotypical. I was hoping for a unique mystery/thriller. Instead, I got a boring movie-of-the-week. The publisher couldn't pay me enough to read one of Clark's books again."
2,Not her best,"It was more like ""comfort food"" reading. Predictable but hey.Definitely not up to what I normally expect from her. Don't give up, try another of her books."
5,CMTD Revision,"BCRAN is the rev of the ""old"" CMTD class. Has a few more current entries, in the course version anyway. I suspect this is just the same book as CMTD with a new cover. Still, its a must have. What else is there? Buy it, live it, love it, pass the test, yahoo."
1,Poorly Written Book - Text Repeated Verbatim from Cisco Web,No need to purchase this book. Just go to Ciscos Web Site and read online documantation for all the BCRAN objectives and you will get the exact same text (if not better) then this book. It appears to me that the author had a poor understanding of the subject to expain it well and general poor writing skills. This is a book you can do without. Shame on Cisco press who normally have quality books. Irving Weiss CCNA CNE MCSE
1,This book is lacking the quality of other cisco press books.,"This book has absolutely no flow to it. It is just a bunch of raw information taken directly from Cisco's site. This raw information is then all jumbled up and thrown between two hard covers.I have read numerous Cisco Press books, up to this point I have been very pleased. I'm currently on page 187, and I honestly don't think I can bring myself to suffer through reading the remaining pages."
3,"Excellent training material, but not the greatest exam prep.","I'm giving this book 3 stars as I've just returned home from taking the CMTD and the exam had topics not covered at all in the book. Here is a short list of topics not covered in the book but present on the exam: L2F, VPDN, MMP, DSL,two-step protocol-translation, logging questions also.However, this was a very informative book and I learned an incredible amount from reading it. But the book is not a complete training guide since it lacks coverage of the objectives I listed earlier. I would recommend scouring CCO and the Dial up Cookbook at Cisco.com to find out about the missing material for the CMTD exam.Oh..........how did I do on the exam? I passed. You think I'm stupid or something? kidding MK"
4,Very dry and not very clear on some parts,If you are suffering from insomnia - your remedy is here!!! Tough to read. Many parts are just there for the heck of it (debug and other troubleshooting commands/explanations) - they simply give you the output - I can do that from my router! You need something alongside of the book if you are a novice in some of these areas. I used additional materials from Cisco website. Why 4 stars? Passed the test. I guess it is good for something.
3,Lots of errors,"Although I passed the test using this book, it was full of typos and errors. For example, it appears that sections of text were cut & pasted from one portion to another and then never edited. NOT the quality one expects from Cisco Press. Rather disappointing."
4,Great Book!,"I easily passed BCRAN by using only this book. Catherine delved into the material deep enough to give a good understanding of the technology, but not too deep to make it difficult to understand. She covers everything you will see on the exam even though this is NOT an exam prep book.There are some obvious mistakes in the book (which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars!), but if you really understand the material, these will be apparent to you. If you never find these problem areas, then you need to reread the material."
3,Great Information --,I won this book at the Nashville Cisco Users Group two weeks ago. It has already helped me to troubleshoot 3 issues we were having with Remote Access. I can't give it four or five because I have not taken the exam and have only used it for a GREAT Reference
2,yuck,"Not an enjoyable book to read. I found this book to be less than useful for a study guide to the 640-505. I'll admit up front that I have little experience with more than extremely basic async configs, but I found the material extremely hard to digest. Yes, I believe all of the information provided is more than adequate to get someone through the exam, however, the presentation makes it difficult to put the pieces together quickly. I wouldn't even consider this book a good reference.I'm guessing it's going to be a dust collector on my shelf. If you're into cram sessions prior to testing, start about 4 days prior with this one. It's probably an easier read if you are already quite familiar with the material, but again, IMO, it makes a terrible study guide. I'm comparing this with books I've read from Lammle/Hales/Sybex."
3,This is not a book for the exam,"I have passed yesterday my last exam, CMTD with 858, so now I am CCNP. I also have passed CCIE written. I must say that this book contains the material for the exam with the exceptions mentioned by the previous reviewer. However, this is not a good book. I knew already almost all of the material so I can say this book does not EXPLAIN things. It PRESENTS things. If you use the book as a reference it's O.K., but if you want to learn, it's a disaster. I found the books written by Todd Lammle excelent. You really can learn and UNDERSTAND things. I HAD to buy this book because Todd announced a book in CMTD, but he never wrote it."
1,Badly written book,"This book does not explain the material well, i.e it is not worth keeping as a reference book unlike Cisco's ACRC book for example.The only reason I bought this book was becuase it covered some of the CMTD exam material (even these sections are badly written), but now I am desperateley looking to sell it. Any offers?"
1,Do not use this book for CMTD,"Do not use this book for CMTD. This book is not design for it, I read only 3 chapters of the book. I passed using other study materials."
5,Very well written book,"I disagree with the negativity that few of the other reviewers expressed towards this book. As the title implies, it's not 100% designed to prepare you for CMTD exam. It's for the new Cisco Exam track which replaces CMTD with BCRAN test. In my opinion, it's a very well written book which covers most of the CMTD requirements and probably 100% of the stuff you will need to know to pass BCRAN test. I, myself used this book exclusively and passed CMTD. All you need to do is read the book, look at the exam objectives and find the missing pieces on Cisco web site. And yes, you have to dig for more information as there is no single source that would give you an answer to all the questions for this (CMTD) or any other exam. Unless, all you want is a piece of ""paper""."
2,A Cisco book through and through,"As a seasoned student of Cisco and it's long list of educational offerings, this book brings no real suprises. When will Cisco take it's educational books seriously? This book is better than most when it comes to simple mistakes but there are still plenty of mistakes and when you see complete paragraphs duplicated on the same page you know it hasen't been proof read.There is not the detail that Cisco books normally provide. Some sections go straight to the configuration without any real explanation of what is going on. Screen dumps lack the content to allow you to clearly see the full configuration. There is a real lack of clarity, probably the worst of the books I've read so far, and I've read a few. But, I've come to know that if you learn all that is in the book you will pass the exam. That is the only good comment I can make about this 'standard' Cisco offering."
4,Cool for the kids...,I bought this for my little girls after Professor Griff of Public Enemy referenced this book during one of his lectures. This is most definitely a worthwhile purchase for your up and coming future leaders.
2,mixed,Color was not what was shown on internet and conditon was less than desireable so it was returned. Construction was solid and assembly easy. Return was flawless. Highly recommend working thru Amazon as opposed to direct. It eleiminates any doubt. Price is not equitable with what you get. Not a good value.
4,Best Gamecube Game,"Easily one of the best Gamecube games. Best played with two people. Loads of fun, great replay value. You may want to increase the brightness settings on your television, as this game can be frustratingly dark at times. Easily the best $15 I ever spent on the Wii."
5,Great RPG for the Cube\Wii,A really fun game for the RPG starved gamecube and heck even wii. Plenty of levels and weapons to acquire during your adventure and the last stages are really good. Also go online to find the easter egg to play as the Drow Elf!
4,Good game but could have been better,"Purchased this to play on the WII since at the time there wasn't any 2 player epics available. I played both 2 player and single player version. The graphics were decent, but would have preferred to be able to change the angle a few times in the game as part of the screen was difficult to view from the set angle. The major draw back of the game was that it wasn't long enough or involved enough for my taste, but was still a fun simple RPG that my husband and I could enjoy together."
2,Not too good...,If you like wimpy over-head view games you'll like this one. The characters are so small they are almost undistinguishable from each other. The worlds are hard to find your way through. Unless you have a walkthrough it would be nearly impossible to find your way through this game. And even then it's still almost impossible not to get lost. I quit after only a few sessions. Because the fun level is almost zero. You can play with a friend. And then both of you can get lost and not have fun.
4,"Must own game, but if you have a PS2 or XBox...","This is a fantastic game if you get any enjoyment out of dungeon crawl games, such as Diablo and Dungeon Siege. The fact that two players can play simultaneously through the campaign alone would make it worth buying, and the fantastic graphics, solid gameplay, and ability to customize your character through skills and feats make this game a must own. However, the Game Cube version is arguably the weakest version of this game, which has also been ported to the XBox and PS2. The frame rates, which are constantly maxed out on the other consoles, regularly dip into the jerky range. However, if you only own a GameCube, this is well worth it."
1,normal people beware,"I played this game once and it was realy bad and nerdy. this is a game that nerds (the ugly kind with long leater coats and plactic jewels that call themsleves lords of daeath an stuff.) play when they arent playing dungeons and dragons. amazon save these young kids life and post my review,"
4,What I Need...,"Their treatment of ""Always There"" is legendary; infact, I like it better than the Ronnie Laws instrumental. Heard it first at dance clubs in Philly like the old Mark IV and Stingers. Have it on wax; wore it out. Their harmonies for a post-70's group are ""a cut above"" average, tho, they are not as daring or as rich as the Dramatics. Lovely tunes included here are ""Time Has No Ending"" and ""I Know You Can""; ""SOS"" is funky, and the quasi-scat of ""Keep that Same Old Feelin"" is a more-than-adequate cover of an original from the Crusaders. I have seen but never heard the debut disc nor ""Goin Bananas"". If either are as good as ""What You Need"", I'll be in search of them as well. This one's the joint, and it fits in my radio show @ WEAA in Baltimore. By the way, it's Augie and his compadres backing Boz Scaggs on tracks from the Silk Degrees including ""Lowdown."""
2,SOMETHINGS MISSING,"FINALLY, THE SIDE EFECT CD. THAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR..ALTHUGH I GIVE THE DISC 2 STARS. I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO HAVE GIVIEN THEM 5 STARS.. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T.. I REMEBER THIS GROUP GROWING UP IN THE 70'S.. I REMEBER MIKIE HOWARD GRACING THEIR GROUP WITH HER TALENT..AGAIN IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE SONGS THAT I REMEMBER ARE NOT A PART OF THIS COLLECTION.. THOSE SONGS BEING 1. MAKE YOU MINE..2 THE LONELYEST MAN IN TOWN. WHICH ARE BYE FAR TWO CLASSICS.. TO THIS DAY, YOU WOULD LOVE MAKE YOU MINE. IT HAS THAT INFECTIOUS TIMELESS GROOVE TO IT.. HOPEFULLY IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE SIDE EFFECT GROUP OR THE POWERS TO BE AT THEIR FORMER LABEL WOULD HAPPEN TO STUMBLE ACROSS THIS.. PLEASE DO ANOTHER COMPOLATION DISC.. WITH THESE TWO SONGS ON IT.. THANKS.. A FAN IN CALIFORNIA"
2,Best Of,"I am in the mood to buy a CD by ""Side Effect"" but is disappointed in the song content... This group didn't exactly light up charts way back however, ""Always There"" and ""Keep That Same Old Feeling"" are cuts that can not be overlooked for anybody collecting 70's R&B. I'm hoping that the labels ""Fantasy & Elektra"" can get together and put the song ""Make You Mine"" on a compilation of their best songs."
4,KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas,"To clarify to those who don't live in the Los Angeles area, KROQ's almost acoustic Christmas is a concert held yearly that gathers top rock/alternative bands for one big show. This CD has songs from the past concerts. So if you like live recored performances, then this CD is for you. KROQ also produces a christmas cd with the same bands doing christmas songs."
2,Is it better than SSX or SSX Tricky? No.,"SSX and SSX TRICKY or both better games. First of all, there is not too much actual snowboarding here. It focuses on incredibly lame combat, with weapons such as chains and baseball bats. The trick system is set up just like it is in Tony Hawk or Shaun Palmer, but that systme does not work well. It is unresponsive, and useless. Mission objectives in the levels are terrible as well, not to mention extremely frustrating. a little bit of fun can be had in the ""Quick Race"" mode, but it wears off quickly. Even if you already beat SSX TRICKY, do not buy."
2,"Its combat on snowboards, fun? you decide","Me, I liked espn winter xgames 2 because of its HUGE career mode, seriously i was drowning in the game's depth. This game focuses more on an unrealistic arcade style battle game, like it? buy the game, like pure snowboarding? THEN HELP ME GET KONAMI TO MAKE ANOTHER WINTER XGAMES SNOWBOARDING! Im serious, email me. anyhow, the game is bad to me because of the lack of snowboarding depth and realism. but if you like bashin monsters over the head with the same guy whos got a gold medal at the xgames, then this is for you."
5,A non-mom reviewer,"I loved this book!!! As I contemplate future parenthood, this book hit just the right chord. It was funny, irreverent, sincere, and an honest look at being a new mom without sugar coating a thing! It's similiar to the Shopaholic series (which I also loved), but perfect for the next phase in one's life. If you want a laugh out loud book, this is it."
2,Joke Abuse,"The idea of a parent keeping track of every little expense incurred by raising a child with the intent of making the child pay for it is kind of funny.Sort of.But the author harps on the topic, beating the joke into the ground until I wanted to tell her to put down the calculator and pick up her kid.The viginettes of life with Callie are often amusing, but the overall feel of the book, with Mom retentively counting every cent spent on her innocent offspring, is surprisingly distasteful."
1,This book left me bitter towards the woman who wrote it.,"First of all, this woman has ""unprotected sex for several weeks"" and now she has the nerve to bill her first born for all the expenses. If she made the choice to to put herself in that situation then she should have been responsible for the outcome. Her daughter Callie was in no way indebted to her mother for her mother's actions. This book was dreadful and I can't imagine any mother indebting her own unborn child.Take responsibility for your own actions, your child owes you nothing.So I guess Callie will be billing her mother for all Callie's psychologist appointments when she is older."
4,very good,This book is simple and fun. (not too scary) This book also has pronunciation written out - which is very helpful.
3,It's OK,"I was a bit disappointed. It was for my 3.5 year old, I think the book is a bit to young for him. The pictures are very cartoonish, therefore hard to distinguish between the dinosaurs.My son loves it, but I think he will grow out of it very quickly."
4,Chck Shuldiner,"This a very melodic, Heavy with power cd. A must have for any Chuck Shuldiner fan and fans of Death."
5,Speechless,Great music in the vein of oldschool Heavy Metal. Charles Schuldiner plays guitar on here so I had to check this out.
5,not from this world,"This is Chuck's masterpiece. It's just amazing how complex this album is, I still cannot believe that a human beign could made something like this. Amazing drums by Richard Christy, awesome alternance of solos between Schuldiner and Hamm, and an unexpected vocal work of Tim Aymar. And of course another bass lesson offered by Steve DiGiorgio. It's just impossible to include it in any style, it's just Metal. Fot the ones familiar with the Death sound, this is the Chuck's last lesson for those who criticized him during the years...Is not an extrem Metal album, because Death was never an extrem Metal band.. Something links togheter all his amazing works, songs like Mutilation, Pull the Plug, Low Life, Cosmic Sea, The Philosopher, Zero Tolerance, Vioce of the Soul, Consumed, are so different by eachother, but in the same time so alike, is something that nobody in this field could create so far... This is just music, made for those who really can feel it, who really believe in it.."
4,This is great,Great music with very good vocals. Steve DiGiorgio is the highlight of the album. Anyone who plays bass and loves the metal scene should check out this album Steve is phenomenal
5,the BEST to date,"This is the best metal ever devised. After listening to this album many times I still find small nuances about it that I hadn't noticed before. If anyone doubts that this is the pinnacle of guitar genius I urge them to try and prove me wrong. I must also admit that this album tops Death's lineup. Tim's voice is so soothing one second, and the next he's tearing his high pitched wails through your ear canals. Absolutely the BEST."
5,Requiem for a genius,"This is the ultimate opus from Chuck Schuldiner before his too early death in 2001 (december 13th). It is also one of his greatest ones. Not the best? How could you answer such a question concerning this authentic genius : all his albums are pure masterpieces, each different from the previous and from the next : here is his last contribution to his experiments in music : he doesn't sing anymore and leaves the vocals to an honest singer (Tim Aymar) who can realize what Chuck couldn't due to his vocal registry : the songs are clear, not any shout : just a VOICE singing! It changes but it is largly positive : the music of Chuck Shuldiner can at last deliver its own beauty (it was actually the case before, but required a serious listening, not an ""ambiant"" one)thanks to a singer who can show almost immediately the depth and emotion of the notes Chuck Shuldiner created. Worse is consequently his death for he had just begun to tread new paths for a wider audience..."
5,PURE GENIUS IN EVERY RESPECT,"This record came as a complete surprise. Being a fan of Chuck and Death for quite some time (since '91) I knew he was awesome, but Control Denied still swept me off the floor. Some reviewers seem to accept that it is a great effort, but sort of dismiss it as mere technical exercise. Not so! Each and every song on this album is a technical, melodic and SONGWRITING masterpiece of Pure Metal. The playing is brilliant, the structures are brilliant, the riffs and melodies 100% genius, even if some have a tinge of classic metal/thrash to them. Nowadays, no artist in any genre can be said to sound 100% original, without the slightes trace of another artist's influence on the music. I mean, a band like Primus, which to me is as original and unique as it gets, often has elements traceable to bands like Rush, Yes and bassist Stanley Clarke. I say this is one of the top 5 Metal albums EVER. Period."
4,Excellent,"Excellent timing, book was in described condition at a fair price. Much appreciated. Only problem was the writing in the book, I am not sure if I missed this in the description but it has been distracting when trying to work with the text. Overall, though, fantastic."
3,Out of the Kitchen,"I would like to offer a correction and some clarification on B. Marold's review of this book. It is Simone Beck and not Weill who had a cooking school in Provence. And Julia Child did not just happen to ""live across the street"" from Simca. Julia and Paul Child built a house on Simca's property.I was fortunate enough to also take classes from Simca. Taking classes meant that you lived in one of the houses on her estate for a week or two and met each morning for a class and the resulting lunch. As it happened, Julia and Paul Child were also encamped at the same time. They were a delightful couple and I have very fond memories of that summer in Provence and my time spent at Simca's.Usually we had dinner at some wonderful restaurant but there were evenings that we went shopping in the village or Nice for fresh fish and cooked dinner in the very kitchen at served as the laboratory for ""Mastering the Arts of French Cooking."" A priceless experience."
5,Back help,"This video helped me enormously in discovering how to begin to move (and think!) differently in order to help my back pain and daily discomfort. Giving solid examples of everyday activities, the video addresses common problems people have with the way they move and how it effects their backs--from the way they sit at their desks at work to how they carry their briefcases(much of which I was unaware I was doing). The instructor shows how with simple adjustments to your movements you can prevent injury and pain. I found it very practical and helpful in identifying my own problems, and I have given it as a gift to friends with back troubles. It's also a nice introduction to the Alexander Technique."
1,They blew it,"I ordered this item on Friday, December, 16 and paid for the expedited shipping in order to recieve the item in time for Christmas. They didn't ship it until the following Tuesday and then yesterday I got an e-mail that the item was dropped and damaged while they were packing it. I'm not sure whether they're simply too incompetent to stick a horn in a box or whether they never intended to sell this item for the listed price. I'm absolutely sick about not being able to have this saxophone under the tree for my wife this Christmas."
3,Melodic Death Metal from The Netherlands,"Yet another fine band from Holland. Mangled play the older style of HEAVY Death Metal, right off upon hearing this album i thought of bands like Scattered Remnants and Dehumanized. and i also hear some Suffocation elements, make that VERY Melodic Suffocation influences. good stuff here with great sound quality."
1,Disappointing collection of condensed stories,"This book contains short stories on mercenary actions around the globe. Most of them are condensed versions of books on the subject. There is no connection between the chapters and no overview from the editor.Nice to browse thru, but I recommend the real deal instead:Mike Hoare, The road to KalamataAnthony Mockler, The new mercenaries"
3,Language of Flowers,"The tile of the book is misleading. This book is actually a blank scripture journal. This is a hardcover book with a quotation cited from the bible on each page. The cover has a floral print on both front and back. On the back cover are the words ""INSPIRATIONS"" and ""a scripted journal."" This is a lovely book for a gift or for oneself to use as a journal, but the association to the ""language of flowers"" escapes me. No place on the book are the words ""Language of Flowers."" In fact, ""A friend loves at all times, Proverbs 17:17"" is written across both the front and back covers. As I said, it is a handsome blank journal for a gift or other usage. If someone is purchasing this book to learn the meaning of flowers, they will be disappointed; I was."
3,Frustrating filming,"Once again, Rick Wakeman's performance is incredible. I was well aware I was buying a video where he would be performing on piano. But, I found the filming to be extremely frustrating, often concentrating on orchestra members rather than Rick, the lead performer.This constant switching of performers deleted from the beauty and power of the performance.I tend to doubt I would ever watch this video again, but I will use it as a CD where the bad camera work will not distract me from the power of this piece."
2,Not what I'd recommend,"I'm a huge fan of the WoD world by White Wolf publishing, so I bought this book. Like most anthologies, by the time you finally start sympathizing with a character, the story ends. In addition, most of the enclosed stories are repetitious, a new ghost enters the underworld for the first time and gets slaved by an older ghost. Only one story is worth the read."
4,A must have for any WoD player,This book is a work of art. I have to say that it is the best that I have read in a long time. This book is a keeper. It inspired my to go to new heights in my chronicals
4,Whoops,"should have ordered 4ohm speakers these are 8ohm and i ordered them to replace infinity speakers in dodge dakota - 2ohm system! But great speakers anyway, just not loud when damped down by ohms@!!!"
5,EXCELLENT,"These speakers are extremly good for the price and work fantastically with the SONY car stereo. Supplier pagaged very well to protect the product without making it oversized as some do, arrived a little earliwer than the estimated delivery date with standard shipping."
2,So so speaker,After having these speakers for over 6 months I am not that impressed. One of them is making a fluttering and crackling sound when heavy bass is playing. I do not believe the cone is very durable. I also have a set of identical speakers in sony that I have not had a problem with. I have had bad experiences with pyle in the past and decided to give them another try. Fool me once shame on me fool me twice I will not buy your product again.
1,Crappy product plus great show equals massive frustration.,"I join with the other reviewers that have crappy discs in them. I have the same issue, so far disc four on season two will not even load, and I notice a slight chip on the side. This makes the whole pretty much worthless."
3,Collector Sets are the pits,"I love the series, my only problem is with the collector sets. It doesn't seem to matter what show it is the collector sets always have bad disk's in them. The quality control is the pits. It might just be that there are just too many disk's in a single package. I have purchased many complete season sets and not had any trouble, but these collector sets are nothing but trouble. You can't get one without bad disk's in it. Plus it takes a long time to watch every one to be sure each disk is good."
3,"Not bad, but not great, either","We loved Buffy, and I love David Boreanaz, so I had really high hopes for this spin-off. The show is fine, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I'm glad I've got it, and really like a few of the episodes, but I don't think it will get the play Buffy does in our house. And as far as David Boreanaz goes, we've got all the seasons ofBones: The Complete First Season. He's way better as Booth."
5,Great Quality,"I really loved this product, very good quality, I am sure that if you are a fan you will gonna love too."
4,Angel,I love this TV show! It compact! I find it funny to see David Boreanaz face on the side of the DVD cases :) I also like the letter from Joss Whedon. But i wish it had more bouns featues i thought they could do a special disc for it but they did not. but other then that It great any one who is a fan would love it.
1,No quality control on this boxset,"I love this show, but I cannot overlook the terrible quality control that went into producing this box set. I went through two different box sets before I found one that had no defects (at least, none that I'm aware of yet). 20th Century Fox was absolutely no help in resolving my issues with mislabeled discs. HELLO!? Fox produced this box set, they are ultimately responsible for manufacturer defects in the discs! When you order this box set, you better make sure that all the discs will play correctly and that they contain the labeled content. By the way, you only have the 30-day return policy in which to accomplish this. Yes, that's right, you're expected to view all 30 discs worth of material within a month, otherwise you are out of return policy if you discover any issues later."
2,knock-off,"This show is really just a cheap knock off of Forever Knight. If you liked this show you definately need to check it out. It was better written, acted, and much more believable than Angel. It also had a really dark streak to it, unlike the mostly silly monsters in this show"
4,grrr aarrrgh,"Box had a slightly crunched corner but hey, coulda been the mailman. Was totally stoked with the product, was more than i hoped for."
5,Angel - Complete Series Collector's Set,Fabulous! Loved it! Delivered in excellent condition. My son and I enjoyed every minute of it . . . we watch almost every day. Thank you! Really enjoy all the extras too!
5,Great show.,I am pleased with this purchase because I got to watch all the episodes that I missed when the show was on air.
3,good but was a little off product description,My boxed set came with everything but had little Knicks on the sides of the box which disappointed me because it was a gift for my friend.
3,Why are the boxes messed up?,"This was just great. i waited 3 weeks to get sent my full 5 season of Angel. so when i recieved them in the mail i was very much excited. i opened the box and all 5 seasons put together should make angel's face. except mine didn't. instead of getting a number 3 for season 3, i recieved two number 5's. the disks are correct but it still isn't right. its a collectors item and it should be complete. so instead of having angels face complete he has a double chin."
3,Hey it's Angel what do you want,"I had forgotten just how painfully bad the start of Angel was...... hey wait a minute, no I didn't. I never saw it, I only saw from the very end of season 1 on. Yeh it get's going about half way through season 1 and starts to click and then what can I say it's Angel. The packaging hey it's novel and different it might be a bit hard to get it to fit with the rest of your DVD collection but it's a marketing ploy kind of cute."
1,Very Angry!,I LOVE the series of Angel. But I bought the Complete Box set from Supermart and they were burned. They had a green line through the picture. Very annoying! DON'T buy from Supermart!
2,Not the complete series,"The item description leads one to believe that you are buying the complete series which ran for 9 years. This is not the case, you will recieve seasons 1 through 5. Other vendors that offer the complete series do include all nine seasons at prices comparable to this."
4,Show had its moments,A cool show but not better than Buffy. Show had its moments. Angel son Connor is a big bore. His whole storyline was kind of a waste. The other people in the show did well. Very good vampire series. Glad they added Spike at the end from the Buffy series. If you like Buffy then you should like this.
5,fast shipping,"I ordered this from the goldbox at a great price! I got it for my mom to give to her sister for her b-day, which is still a couple months away. Shipping was super fast, as always!"
5,A must for All Buffy/Angel fans,"After Angel leaves Buffy in Sunnydale you follow him on his quest to make amends and find his place in the world. Angel Series has various tie-ins with the Buffy series, so watch both to get the full story, although can be watched separate, but what fun is that? Angel season 1 parallels with Buffy season 4 and Angel season 5 airs after Buffy concludes."
5,Angel series....AWESOME!!!,"To me the full series was awesome, but as every good series go, there were some not-so-awesome seasons...season 3 for example, that particular season wasn't my favorite, but thinking about it, the actors played their characters as it was scripted, so even if there was a particular character you loved to hate, that just means that the actors did their part to portray that character. I just want to say that the Angel series, to me, should have gone on for another two seasons, so that Joss Whedon could have had time to give us a tremendous last episode as he did on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. With the time frame he had to work with, he did the best he could, so Joss, you are the man."
2,defective,"All disks have been good except the 1st disk of season 5. It does not play and after inspection it is easy to see why this is. It is not scratched, but incorrectly burned onto the disk. You can see where the edges are not quite even. I have been trying to make contact to remedy this fault, but to no avail. I would be happy to write a glowing review if this seller would just replace the defective disk."
5,angel boxed set query,I really like angel. are the sets in the big collector set boxed individually or shrinkwrapped?
4,Ended Too Soon,"My first experience with AtS was ""Are You Now or Have You Ever Been"" and it remains to this day as one of my favorites.My disappointment in this set is that there is no mention of ""Doyle"" and the part he planned in the 1st season. I understand the real-life drama but Glenn Quinn's character was as crucial to the 1st season as Charisma Carpenter's.My other disappointment is that there aren't any ""new"" extras.I like the packaging and that it makes it easy to find your favorite episode or season.This set could've been better but still worth the purchase."
5,Angel Series,Awesome FAST service! Item was shipped the next day after ordering and I recieved it right away. All of the five seasons that I purchased were in brand new condition and at a great price! I really appreciate great sellers on Amazon that are like this seller. I would definately do business with this seller again!Thanks again! My husband is going to love these for Christmas!
1,"Great Show, Bad DVD's",I bought this box set because I love the show but after only having it for a few months the DVD's started to degrade. They have strange prism type squares on the surface on the DVD that makes it unable to play. I've had the box set for a year now I've found three DVD's with that problem that are just useless now.
4,Perfect companion to the Buffy boxset,"This is a surprisingly good show and a must-see for Buffy fans. Season 1 is weak but improves mid-point and becomes a charming show in its own right through Season 2. Season 3, 4, 5 are excellent and I wish there had been a couple more seasons. It's not as good overall as Buffy (which is one of the best shows in the history of television) but it reaches the same heights through certain arcs and is definitely worth buying.This is an excellent boxset, identical in design to the Buffy Chosen Collection. They are perfect together, just like Buffy and Angel were!"
5,Totally satisfied,"The packaging is really nice. It doesn't take up much roomon on my DVD shelf. Best of all, it was a great tv series."
4,Angel mmmmmm,"I was so excited to finally purchase Angel in a box set. When the show was on TV I did not have the opportunity to watch every episode, so it was worth while waiting to relive and enjoy the episodes I missed. Even with seeing his reflection in a puddle at the start of every episode and the nasty flashbacks to life without a soul I am enjoying every episode some again and it wont be the last time. Also thank you Amazon for offering this fantastic buy, which is not available anywhere in OZ. eat your heart out Buffy I can see Angel everyday !!!!!!"
4,the dark avenger,the only thing i didn't like about this box set was that one of the season 4 discs looked like a s4 disc but when played was actually a duplicate season 1 disc. other than that it was perfect and I'm sooo freaking happy to actually own all five seasons of angel!
4,Great set.,What can I say? This is a great series that really builds up speed and dramatic weight as it goes on. This and Buffy are some of the best television I have every seen.
4,"Great, but...","If this product had come intact, I'm sure I would have been very happy with it...but, it came in horrible condition. The box looked like it had been run over, one side of the metal overlap is scraped up and slightly bent, and the other is completely unusable because it's been bent flat.For now it will work for what I need, since I planned on unhinging it and only using half of it to hold lights for my turts anyways.so all in all, it's a great product when it's whole, but I'm very disappointed in the delivery conditions.(I'm not blaming Amazon for this.)"
3,Good basic item,"This is a good basic item, just the type we needed, and reasonably priced. The only problem we have is that the center support is plastic, and our light hood has a fixture at the same place. It melts the center support piece."
1,Mine was damaged too.,Dont waste your money on this. i didn't listen to the other reviewers because i thought that there was some sort of mistake. NOPE! I now have a permanently bent up screen cover. $30 thrown away. the only thing holding this lid down is my screen clips but its still noticeably bent. i always find something i love about an item and NEVER wrote a bad review but i just HAD TO with this one. PLEASE FIX THE PACKAGING FOR THIS ITEM! will not recommend. absolutely not
2,Cheap Product,"This product is very very weak, i felt like i could have snapped this in half and right off the hinges. Each door is only about 4-5 inches at BEST. The product also came warped and bent on 1 end of the outside border. Doesn't work well with a 48"" reptile light hood so avoid this product if you have that size"
3,Just OK. Nothing special,"I received the item damaged due to poor packaging. I managed to make it work however. Customer service was very helpful when presented with the shipping disaster and offered to replace it. The item itself was somewhat cheaply made. It didn't quite fit and was somewhat flimsy but for the price, it was ok."
2,cold clinical text with high faluten language,This book is not a guid for the patient the victim and the therapist. it is for the therapist alone. as a victim i found this to be like reading a text book. it uses alot of medical and psychological jargon and feels inaccessible to the depserate lay person looking for guidance.
3,Not enough Stretches,"I'm sorry but I really did not like this DVD.Beware, this is very yoga-inspired. You do a lot of Downward Dog and some difficult poses, but not a lot of STRETCHING. There are some basic ones here. I really like Jane Fonda's stretches at the end of her aerobics and I was looking for more ""deep, total body stretch."" This is just more yoga with SOME stretching thrown in.Also, if you are like me and find the ""inhale/exhale"" distracting and annoying, this will really get on your nerves. I know how to breathe, thank you!I really liked the other instructor Moira Merrithew and actually I will be getting some more of her tapes, but she is not the main instructor for this one.Sorry. Nice series, but if you are looking for some deep relaxing, thorough stretches, this is not the best choice."
4,for some [most?] gamers,"Something for somebody. Actually, for a bunch of somebodies. There is always a thrill to getting a clandestine edge in a game. Davis appeals to those gamers who believe this. (Which may be most of them.) He describes various techniques for several popular games, that give you unorthodox byways into their innards.Of course, for single player games, this is sometimes decried as equivalent to cheating at solitaire. But there's no gainsaying the sheer fun of it!"
5,One of my favorites,"This is a great CD from one of the greatest Irish bands performing today. I've listened to this album dozens of times, and far from being sick of it, I like it better every time. If you like the Makems or Irish music in general, this is a must buy."
3,Best I've heard in a long time,"The cd begins with an introduction of the Makem and Spain Brothers and they burst out singing Highland Paddy. These strong voices are well suited to the song, and I find it hard to believe anyone could not be affected by the music. This has been in the cd player of our car for months now, and we are still not tired of it. It has been a long time, perhaps since The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were making records, since any music was this powerful.If you like Irish music, if you like folk music, if you like good singing, you will like this cd. There isn't a weak track on it. The original songs are wonderful."
1,Not Really Connected to the Movie,"The compilation doesn't appear to have anything in common with the Movie ""Dirty Dancing"" other than containing some tunes from the 50's. A much better choice would be to purchase the ""Ultimate Dirty Dancing"" CD which has all of the songs from the movie in chronological order.01 Twist and Shout / Isley Brothers - 02:3202 Little Latin' Lupe Lu / Kingsmen - 02:2603 Sitting In The Park / Billy Stewart - 03:1504 Working In A Coal Mine / Lee Dorsey - 02:4905 Million To One / Jimmy Charles - 02:2706 Body Heat / James Brown - 04:1607 Ten Commandments of Love / Harvey & The Moonglows - 03:4308 Limbo Rock / Chubby Checker - 02:2609 Stay In My Corner / Dells - 02:5510 Wiggle Wobble / Les Cooper - 02:04"
4,Strong for its compact size,"I really like this hairdryer. It's compact, great for travel and surprisingly powerful for its size. But I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the last one I had shorted out after just 2 years of use."
5,Blow Dryer,"The Vidal Sasson Ionic Travel dryer I received in the mail is working very well. It is light and flexible, and does a good job of drying my hair. I am pleased with the purchase."
5,Great little dryer!,I was looking for a dryer that folds for travel and yet is powerful enough to dry my long hair in a short amount of time. This one fit the bill. The only complaint I have is that the diffuser that is advertised with it (additional purchase) does not fit this dryer whatsoever. It fits my larger dryer otherwise I'd be more annoyed since it's such a hassle to return things. I don't normally assume but since it was advertised with this dryer I didn't give it a second thought! :(
2,Lasted 1 year,"I think a blow dryer should last more than 1 year, so am disappointed in this product's durability, but on the other hand, I didn't like it much, so am glad I am forced to buy a new one. To be completely fair, I am reviewing last year's version of this dryer, which looks similar (gold color), but who knows- they may have changed it, for all I know.Anyway, my gripes are 1) the ON button is a rocker switch which is hard to turn on and with 3 settings, easy to overshoot the middle position. 2) the cold burst isn't cold - it's just slightly less hot and with far less wind force. During the summer I usually dry my hair on the cold setting, as it's already too hot in my bathroom. So what I want is lots of air and no heat - just the opposite of what this dryer delivered.A long time ago I had a huge Vidal Sasson dryer that I loved. I'm going to try something else this time, though."
3,It broke first use,"I'm not giving this only one, because I suspect with five other five start reviews it was just a defective one in the bunch. I gave to my sister, and she didn't even get one full use out of it."
2,Disappointed,Product has a musty/mildewy smell to it. The box did not appear to have been wet or damaged. Item did ship on time. Would not order from this company again.
3,Ionic Dryer,"The review would have been higher, however the movement of the low/off/high switch does not smoothly give the desired location. It often requires an extra effort to move the lever to the desired position."
2,Vidal Sasson Travel Dryer,"Not that small and attachment, very inconveniently, only goes in one direction- not the direction that is needed!"
5,fast hot excellent,"I bought and returned 3 hairdryers from different companies before finding this one. Superb. I have thick hair that takes a while to dry normally. Not with this drier. I'm out in 2-3 min tops. It's light, it folds, it has a place to hang it. It is a perfect hair dryer that is worth twice what I paid"
1,Broke in 5 mins,"This is supposed to be an international dryer. Plugged in while in the UK, smoked and died in 5 mins. Don't buy"
1,Couldn't get voltage switch to work,I bought it for trip where I needed dual voltage but we couldn't get the voltage switch to turn. Wouldn't recommend.
1,More sparks--dangerous item.,Sparked and died on 2nd use. Will never buy Sassoon again. This item should be pulled off shelves.
1,Worked for less than 6 months,"It was very good when it worked. I did not use it extensively, as I also have a bigger one I use when I'm at home. Today it started to vibrate in my hands, emit scratchy sounds and later smoke started to run the dryer. I immediately stopped it not to get an electric shock. Based on some previous feedbacks, it seems to be a 'usual' way how these fans end their short lives. It also seems that with a so called 'limited warranty' of this manufacturer, it would be easier (and maybe even cheaper for me) to buy a new one instead of trying to send this one to the manufacturer.Simple conclusion - if you like it - buy it. It will probably work for some time and make you happy. But bear in mind, that it is very unreliable."
4,It works great so far,So far I have loved my blow dryer. It is a small compact size and fits easily in my drawer. I use it for my regular blow dryer because I live in a small apartment and have to move frequently. I only wish it had a diffuser attachment.
4,hair dryer,"Hi, I bought this hair dryer because mine was cutting off when it got warm(bad thermostat)and this one even has an ion diffuser,because hair needs ion's,,the only drawback is that is has a button to cut the heat off(push) to set the curl, it just puts it in low speed, other than that its great!"
2,dangerous!,"this is really a featherweight dryer and works well,but caught my hair twice (in ionic settings) and a bunch of hairs wentinside, after that I was scared to use this dryer, so I coulduse it for hardly a week after buying."
2,"OK, not good for me","This hair dryer has two settings: low and high. High produces high wind speed and high temperature. Low produces low wind speed and low temperature. That does me no good! I need low to still be hot for styling. Also, with my fine hair the high setting is much too hot for my scalp.The hair dryer is also loud (however my old one did claim to be ""quiet"").Oh well. I returned it. I would not recommend to people with fine hair or sensitive scalps."
1,Didn't last a year!,I purchased two Vidal Sasson VS784 hair dryers. Both stopped producing heat in less than a year. They now reside in the local landfill. Save your money. Stay away from this product.
2,Don't buy if you are traveling to Europe,"I've never reviewed a product before but thought the issues I had with this hair dryer warranted a review. If you are using this hair dryer in the US, then it's a good product. If you are buying this hair dryer for use in Europe (specifically France and Spain) the product's voltage of 250 is not correct. The voltage there is 230 so the hair dryer did not work. I was also not able to turn the voltage button easily. I ruined a pair of tweezers in the process."
1,"Danger: product overheats, do not buy","I have purchased a total of four of these hair dryers. The first functioned for more than two years, which I think is acceptable for a travel hair dryer. I've had the second for about two years, and it is still functioning, though it has begun to overheat, so I'm not sure how long it will continue to operate. The third overheated and burned out within days, and the fourth OVERHEATED AND BURNED OUT LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. Recent models are faulty; do not waste your money."
1,Sparking before dying,"I enjoyed this hair dryer for the year I had it because it was very compact and portable, however about two weeks ago as I was using the dryer it suddenly stopped working. I fiddled with the cord and it started working again. This happened about 3-4 times where it would stop but then start again if I messed with the cord. Finally, one day as I was blow drying my hair it sparked at the outlet where it was plugged in and completely stopped working. Scared me to death. So glad nothing caught fire and that it didn't get me."
2,Burned out before 6 months,"I really like this hairdryer. I have very long and thick hair and it dries it well and quickly. The dryer is light weight and great for traveling.The problem I have with this dryer is it burned out before 6 months and it just didn't burn out, it created a minor explosion and I could hear a piece crash into something on the inside of the dryer, then the smell of burning.I am returning it to Helen of Troy LP, who make this dryer and hope the same thing doesn't happen to its replacement."
2,Dance Party 2000 is New Level of Mediocrity,"1999 was a great year for club music. With major releases by Basement Jaxx, Cassius, Moby, Chemical Brothers, and countless other artists, Dance Party 2000 seems strangely out of place. The song selection itself is strange, with no real method, and a good portion of this music is more top 40 than house. The transitions between songs are absolutely abysmal for the most,as smooth as chopped gravel, and rather obnoxious. This is probably the single most average example of DJing I've heard on record, also displaying just how fine the line is between a true artist and a merely competent one. For those who are looking for an entrance to club music, this might be a safe purchase, but to anyone familiar with club music, this will prove to be yet another boring, faceless mix that you've heard 100 times already."
1,Why don't we just stop brainwashing our children?,"Why do we as a nation keep insisting on ""kiddifying"" the stories in The Bible, as if that would downplay the sordid, abhorrent, incredulous, and violent aspects of them? And not only that, but indoctrinating them by masking the fact that all of it is pure fiction, and plagiarized fiction to boot? If you want to read your kids fantasy stories, identify to your children the tales and deeds in The Bible as exactly what they are, and have a biology teacher explain why the mechanics of this story is preposterously infeasible. Then consider, instead, any number of proper fantasy stories, like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, or even Eragon. If you want to expand their minds, pick up some National Geographical and get them excited about why the animals of the world as so wonderful. Or pick up any book of dinosaurs with up to date information and groom them to understand what REALLY happened to the dinosaurs(hint, they weren't on Noah's Ark)."
1,Sheffield 12705 Knife,Very disappointed with durability. The auto-lock tab broke off immediately after opening then closing the blade ONCE just to test the actuation...I didn't even using the knife. The problem is the lock design; its consists of a rigid straight piece with a narrowed part (to enable 'bending') buts its too thin so (being brittle stainless steel) it simply snapped off. They should have used a spring-steel or angled stainless steel locking tab. The knife is junk; I threw it away and will never buy another Sheffield knife.
4,GREAT FIRESIDE READING,The author captures the heart of the dog lover with his sharing of emotions between man and dog.Great story of the escapades of a man and his best friend.
4,gotta have their live show,"helluva an album. we've always known the sparks were great live and it's so nice to have a clean, mastered album that captures a sort of greatest hits effort of songs as well as hilarious rennie on stage. and brett's voice is so powerful. great record, love it."
5,Excellent hands-on reference for all levels of need,"I have worked as a vocational counselor for many years, and I use this book on a regular basis with my clients as well as with my own family/friends. A nice feature of The Career Portfolio Workbook is that it outlines what you need to do during the process of creating a portfolio, but also recognizes that some people don't have the time to work through the process in a step-by-step fashion. For example, the book has a note in the introduction that if you need a portfiolo in a hurry - say, for an interview tomorrow - you need to read chapters X and Y. With a week to prepare, chapters W, X, Y, and Z should top your reading list. If you have more time, read the whole book.The directions are wonderful, and allow each person a wide range of flexibility in terms of developing a unique style of presentation. The book includes templates, sample portfolios, and other documents you can modify for your own use.Highly recommended."
2,Rockport 2/tone oxford (Sabine),"Shoes are attractive and as shown in the presentation. They are deficient in cushioning and 8-1/2 is more likely 9. Width is accurate. Considering the aggravation and expense of returning, the shoes most likely will end up at Goodwill."
1,Cruel Shoes,"I was able to wear these shoes out for exactly one night. They butchered my feet like I was wearing deli slicers. My father went to the emergency room that night and I had to go home and change before joining him because my socks were filling up with blood and I was worried I'd wreck my car on the way to the hospital. These make wooden clogs feel like Air Jordans. Perfect for the fashionable masochist who hates himself. Everyone else would be better off going barefoot on a hike up a volcano. I did not particularly care for these shoes, is what I'm saying."
3,So much fun!!,This is absolutley great!!! Musicians will really appreciate the hard work and thought that had to go into making this. My whole family loved it!!
3,music needs to address contemporary genre,"The animation is excellent, actually I'd rate the animation '5 stars'. But because the music is not enjoyable to listen to more than once or twice at most, I put the DVD's away and may never watch them again, hence 'the 3 stars' rating. I would suggest employing a more contemporary musician to add a touch of relevance to today's musical market...any genre would do, new age, R&B, rock, avant-garde, alternative... The monotony of the music is boring. I would purchase only one more edition just to see if there is any musical improvement."
3,Great show but poor render quality,"This DVD is outstanding, no doubt about it. These guys are geniuses! My only complaint (and reason for the 3-star rating) has to do with the DVD quality. If you play it in big screen (LCD 40"" or more) with 720p or better, the DVD looks pixelated. Not good quality. Just 853 X 480 pixels! -Even the demo they let you download for free at their website has better image quality than the DVD. I got the demo and was very expectant that the DVD had a better quality but it dissapointed me. They should release a blue-ray version or something. I love all the extras they included, including both full screen and wide screen versions, angles and lots of material of the production process which is fascinating. However, they packed too much material in a single DVD and had to sacrifice the size and resolution of the actual videos. I would have preferred less bonus materials and better quality videos."
5,"Continues the great quality of the first,",This DVD is just as good as the first DVD - Animusic. Our family loves it.
5,Awesome,"This is the best computer generated short film I've ever seen.It's good as any Pixar shorts.I hope Mr. Lytle comes out with a new one,soon. If you want something with lots of imagination,this is it."
4,Animusic DVD,"Saw this on PBS and had to have it. No idea how they thought of this or how they did it, but it is AWESOME !"
3,Animusic 2 can't touch Animusic 1,"I looked forward with great anticipation to the second release of Animusic (I've had great enjoyment from the first DVD) and was somewhat disappointed in this new DVD. The use of similar animations from the first release (Pogo Sticks, Pipe Dream 2) and the lack of more ""new"" techniques contributed to the bland feeling I had when I viewed the DVD. I was excited by the first piece (Starship Groove) and impressed with the sonics of the disc but that beginning was the only highlight of the program, in my opinion."
4,Amazing to watch,"For people like me, who enjoy watching computer-rendered animations, this video is awesome. The mechanical movements of the devices that make the music in the different segments are flawless. Gears, strings, moving parts; everything is timed perfectly, and exactly in sync with the music.Google it. They have a website where you can go to download one segment, which takes a while, even on broadband. It's worth the wait. It's neat to see. The resolution, shadowing, reflections; everthing has been thought through and is shown with stunning clarity. Makes you wonder if it ever could be built in real life."
4,Excellent service,"The product was #2 in the series, and I wanted it because I liked #1 so much, so I knew what to expect from the product, it was the very efficient, and FAST, service that took my breath.Couldn't be happier.Greg B"
1,Animusic 2,Visuals a good progression from disk 1.Music very boring and insipid.Watch once and it's over.
1,BORING,"robotic-like animals and other objects moving to music - its all the same same same, music is uninteresting, not dancable, and the 'animations' -if you can call them that - are soo repetative. Again, not interesting, not dancable, and repetative annimaitons. Again... . One music track is all you'll need to get the point - i'd slit my wrists if i had to sit through the entire video. My six year old did enjoy it though."
4,Very entertaining music video,"I bought this as a gift and the recipient was very pleased. The visuals are particularly good on a large screen. I would recommend this DVD, especially for those interested in music and computer animation."
4,Animusic II,Animusic 11 is excellent artistically. A1 in terms of computer animated forms. However I expected to see or hear more of the Wow factor in the music department. Specially the Organ section it sounds flat. More bass is a must!!!SincerelyTom
3,Dissapointed,"I am dissapointed because I bought this product to showcase my new HD set up! Well I should have known that this was not produced in HD and the picture would not do the TV justice. More so, I was expecting a lot better music. Really it would received 1 star from me , however what is great about this product is the computer animation! It looks really cool! I hope it is remade in HD with different music - perhaps classical or techno type .. little more to do with bass than just the treble end of the spectrum. More updated music is what I am thinking!"
4,innovative,"After being amazed by the first Animusic, I was looking forward to the next release. I was not disappointed. I especially enjoy all the extra features on the dvd. I highly recommend the set of Animusic 1 and 2. The music is innovative and captivating. It truely has appeal for all ages and interests. My favorite segment is the cathedral piece. This is a must have addition for any music collector.My totally honest review would say that my favorite would still be the first Animusic dvd, but the new release is also a delight."
3,trubble08,"This one uses more ""robotic"" images and for me at least wasn't as entrancing as Animiusic 1. BUT - I wanted to see what they did with ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" and it was great. I recommend it to Animusic Fans, but if choosing between the two, go for Animusic 1."
3,Would have liked some better music,"I watched this two times through and came to the conclusion that the music isn't what it was in the original. The animation is great, but the music is boring."
2,On Frail Wings of Vanity & Wax -Alesana,"I liked it musically, but I really disliked all the screaming vocals on EVERY song. They have good singers, why the heck don't they use their God given talents? I bought almost all their albums last month and liked about 3 songs out of all of them, which is too bad because there is so much natural talent there and its being overshadowed by those screaming vocals. I gave them to my grandson. I'm 63 and I like an awful lot of the newer bands but I thought I'd like these guys better."
5,"Very, very funny!!!","I didn't expect much when I ordered this except a light humor T&A flick. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it actually was. The large amount of topless Japanese hotties didn't hurt either though. If you liked the old movies like ""Meatballs"" and ""Up the creek"", you will love this as it is better than both of those. Great ""B"" movie!!"
1,Not as expected,"I only read a small portion of this book. I thought it was about the Lord, but it's dead spiritually. Perhaps entertaining though."
5,Wonderful book,"This book should be required reading for all Christians. If enough did, we would have a beautiful world. Violence is eating the soul and heart out of this country. We need to turn it around and make the love of Jesus our guiding principle."
4,Lots of Fun,It's such a joy to read fine minds analyzing the WHY of so many culteral phenomena. This was an extra credit book for a class but I couldn't sell it back to the bookstore. Keep it and read it and you'll see why we believe the way we do.
5,Great item!,"I bought the entire set when Amazon was having their 20% off celtic jewelry sale (earrings, bracelet and pendant). What a great deal. Got a lot of compliments. Items are lovelier than they show in the picture and high quality for the price. Highly recommend!"
3,You get what you pay for,"It's pretty enough, but much smaller then I realized. The length is actual 7 3/4"" which is fine since my wife has small wrists, but if you are expecting a full 8"" it'll be problematic. Also much narrower then I would have guessed, may be 1/4"" or so. Looks nice, a classical celtic knotwork design, and seems to be holding up okay, but not truly what was advertised. Given the fact that the size is less then stated, I'd imagine that the silver content is too. Sadly, you get what you pay for... sigh."
5,A very readable and informative booklet,"This is a very readable and informative booklet, and is recommended for anyone interested in the history of British railway history. This edition is 68 pages with 8 pages of photographs, and with plans in the text. It is No. 54 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers, from 1971.These are the author's memoirs of his time in the Brighton Locomotive Works from 1928-1936 (age 16-24). It is very readable, and also very informative, about life in the railway workshops of the time.The Contents are -P03: ForewordP05: PrefaceP07: Growing Up to SteamP13: A Schoolboy Goes to WorkP23: The Erecting Shop with `Mad Jack'P31: `Peaky'P35: Assorted Fun in the Erecting ShopP41: Trial TripP48: The MillwrightsP54: The Erecting Shop Once MoreP61: Back with the MillwrightsP65: Epilogue"
2,Only for the Hebrew themes,"The Bronfman/Mehta recording of the piano concertos is wonderful for the concertos. But the Hebrew Themes (Julliard String Quartet) is dreadful. Because they slow the tempo (for some damned reason) and thereby ruin the whole piece. I was very disappointed, because the concertos and the Overture all together on one two-disc set would have been a treasure. It was enraging and I wanted to throw the whole thing away, and still may and find another recording of the concertos. I like things to be perfect. On this CD, however, the Overture is perfect. It's played up to tempo and is charming. The string quartets, on the other hand, are a horror! As a contemporary critic said of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, it's ugly music. I don't expect Prokofiev's string quartets to rise from the ashes as the Tchaikovsky did! Lt. Kije. The Hebrew Themes. The 7th Symphony. The Piano Concertos. Prokofiev could have done so much, but he wasted his life being modern."
2,Whoops.,"I'm a big fan and have followed the du Pre series since its beginning, but I can't help feeling disappointed in this one. It was seriously flawed. The cult in the story is supposed to play the role of ""bad guy,"" but at first, I couldn't tell that anything was wrong with them, except that they dared move to Montana. Even later, the cultists weren't really fleshed out. It was hard to tell just who they were or what they were like - the dialogue was often hard to follow - and the end was extremely unsatisfying; it left too many unanswered questions.I remember reading an interview with novelist Robert B. Parker in which he said that his first draft was pretty much what got published, and I couldn't help feeling like the same was true here, and what it needed was another polish. In fact, it needed a whole new ending.Don't get me wrong - I'll read every one of these that Mr. Bowen cares to write, they are that rewarding - but if you're curious and want to try one, don't start here."
2,Disapointed,"This was the first novel I have read in the series, and I doubt seriously if I will read anymore. Anti-climactic doesnt even begin to describe the flop that passed for an end to this book. The characters and thier relationships were very unbelievable; this is especially true for the FBI agents who are apparently reoccurring characters in the series. The main protagonist is a likeable character and has some memorable dialogue, but it is not enough to save the rest of the book."
4,Wunderbar,"This recording was made in former East Germany and is therefore in German. If you can get over that (some people have great difficulties with hearing greek music in a foreign speech) you are treated to an exiting composition in an excellent performance. Soloists, choir and orchestra are all firstclass and the recording has been very well remastered. This is Theodorakis at his classical best. You wont find music here like the Zorba Ballet or Canto General, this is music in a pure classical tradition like his symfonies. Listen to ""Form meines Ego"" with its exciting rythms or ""Im toten Wald"" where the homophone singing choir is followed by a wonderfull tenorsolo that sings of freedom. Part 6, Blonder Jüngling with its magical introduction reaches back to earlier compostions such as Oedipus Tyranus and Symfonietta. The only reservation I have is about the declamation which vehemence can be mildly disturbing."
2,"Adequate, but overpriced and not easy to use","Suitable product, but by the time you add the cost of their software, (necessary to print checks) your time to set it up, more time to run a print job of checks, and the excessive cost of their paper, you could purchase pre-printed checks from any of hundreds of companies that sell them for less. And all without the hassle of setting up and using the least user friendly and unnecessarily complex software I have used in many years. This paper ought to cost about 1/2 of the price it is being sold for. If I had not already invested in their dreadful software, I would not be using this. I regret having bought into this check printing system, and would not recommend it to others. Save your time and save your money. Find yourself a check printing company on the web, and avoid the aggravation of dealing with poorly designed software and overpriced supplies."
2,Versa Check Printing Fee,"I bought the software. No where on the box does it say printing is limited. Once you add in the fact that the checks are double the price of competitors, or you have to buy an activation code for every 250 checks you print. This should be disclosed on the box. A rip."
2,A decent reference for shoppers,"Covers all types of spirits and fortified wines. Provides five-star rating system. Brief text entries with no graphics makes book suitable as a reference, but not an enjoyable read."
5,Best Big D album to date!,"You don't have to be from Boston to appreciate this cd. Big D has matured both musically and lyrically on ""Strictly Rude"". I love it more each time I listen to it. ""Steady Riot"", ""Noise Complaint"", ""Snakebite"", ""Strictly Rude"", and ""She Knows Her Way"" are real stand-outs.This cd is a must for Summer 2007, esp. if you love ska and reggae. Play it at your house party or backyard BBQ. Big D are even better live -they outshine all the other bands with whom they play and are really fun to watch- without question. Check them out on the upcoming Warped tour."
2,Inevitable disappointment,"As a long time fan of Bid D & the Kids Table and Ska Punk music in general, this album is simply disappointing. How it Goes set the bar too high for the next album to top; simple as that. While How it Goes had great songs that each stood out because of there unique musical approach and compelling lyrics, Strictly Rude, fails to capture that original quality. There are good songs on the album but not enough to surpass the value of How it Goes or even Good Luck."
4,A Decent product. Plus a little information,"I have used these for several years now for my home use. I had a bunch left over from closing my business and decided to use these up. I have since run out of 'personal checks' and use these for the checks I write.Pay no attention any references to ""Magnetic Ink."" Maybe some bank somewhere still uses a magnetic ink reader but most have gone to optical scanning. No special ink needed.The Bullet points under product description conflict with the text description. I am hoping it is only 1 check per page. The Bullet point says ""3 checks per page"" and that is a different form number. (Form #3000 vs #1000)G7 (the corporate overlords of this product) has recently gone to an online checking account validation system which was a bit bothersome but not a big deal. They confirm your account in similar manner to PayPal. A couple extra hoops for security, I guess.Overall I am pleased with this product."
5,Versa Check,"I also disagree with the bad reviews. I am the director of a small counseling center and we have had nothing but positives in working with Versa Check. Yes, you have to set the software up, but that's a given. And NO, you do not have to have 'special' ink."
5,A good book,"I liked this book so much that I didn't want to stop reding it. I was dissappointed when I finished it because I wanted more. The book told all about the history of Fighting Irish football from the 1940s to 1997. The book was almost entirly written from former ND player's accounts. If you like this book, read Notre Dame's Greatest Coaches by Moose Krause. It is muhc like this book. Talking Irish is one of the best books I have ever read."
4,The true story of Notre Dame football team,"TALKING IRISH is one of my favorite book cause M.Delsohn write the story in six part,one for every decade from the 40's to the 90's.It's more easy to read cause you don't jump from things happen in 1965 to go in 1996 the next paragraph and come back in 1953 after,and it's more easy to consult when you need quick informations.In this book you gonna read both sides of the story the good and the bad,I like that cause too much books talk only about the good side of Notre Dame football story,in TALKING IRISH you gonna read a lot of untold story about players,coachs and school direction who take a lot of decisions on the way the team is coach.Starting from the 40's you follow the story of the team with interview of players,coachs and fans about the greatest moments of Fighting irish story until 1997 season.One of the greatest books about one of the greatest college football team,I recommend it to everyone."
3,The printed version is better than this kindle version,"I've read 'em both. The expanded, printed version of this book is more useful than this short Kindle version. Get the printed copy instead of this one."
4,Interesting point of view,"It is very interesting to find Richard Branson's point of view on some daily things and especially on business. In the book can be found a lot of useful lessons on different topics, from parenting to negotiation.It can be considered as a short guide on how to make your business and personal life much better!"
4,Great/Quick Read,"I found this book to be very motivating and inspiring. It contains great insight on the founding of the Virgin brand and Richard Branson, himself.The stories are very well written and easily painted in your mind. My personal favorites are the balloon stories...although in my opinion the calculated risks out-weighted the rewards which, is a complete contradiction of his business motto. Richard Branson is at the top of my list of favorite people and this book confirmed that positioning for me. Business wise, nice man, big heart."
2,"Don't waste your time, read ""Losing My Virginity"" instead.","I started with Branson's first book, ""Losing My Virginity"", and was absolutely hooked. That book is compelling, insightful, exciting, inspirational, and well-written. ""Screw it, Let's Do It"" on the other hand, is none of those things, and feels like a cheap re-hashing of ""Losing My Virginity"", but without any of the real substance. The writing is poor (leading me to wonder if Branson had a lot of help in writing ""Losing My Virginity"") and he rushes through anecdotes that he explains in detail in ""Losing My Virginity"". The whole book feels very cursory and surface-deep, and doesn't do justice to Branson's incredible persona. Don't waste your time, get ""Losing My Virginity"" instead."
3,Richard Branson needs an editor,"As interesting a character as Richard Branson is, he should definitely hire a better editor. The book was a horrible read."
1,Poorly written,"All I can say really, I was looking forward to learning something from Mr. Branson and quickly into the reading I wondered if he ran his companies as poorly as this book was written. He may be a big risk taker and in many cases he has pulled them off but really he sounds like a 5 year old with a big wallet running around starting businesses and buying islands I don't really see the message in it."
4,"Easy read, Branson's the man","Not any hype just simple things according to Branson. You gotta love this guy, he just went and did it. The book is only 100 or so pages not really of any success principles just through stories of his life he gives us a glimpse into his philosophy. I liked it and its worth the read."
5,Loved it!,"I read this book on a 1 hour flight and loved it. I found this book to be inspirational, motivating and fun to read. Sir Richard Branson is truly a bold and amazing person. I enjoyed reading about his various adventures of flying hot air balloons and all the risks it entailed. This book is about challenging yourself, making bold moves, never hesitating or settling for anything less than you want in life. This is a wonderful quick read for some long term inspiration to your life."
4,Great and inspiring book,"It's a great and inspiring book, very easy to read and with a strong message on it I was really pleased to read and see that things can be done, just be bold and kind at the same time. I really recommend it to every entrepreneur to get inspired by this crazy dude, very intelligent and with a big heart."
1,Don't waste your money,"This has got to be the cheapest, worst produced DVD ever. Let's start with the Transfer which clearly was taken from a VHS copy of the movie and a poor VHS copy at that. The picture quality is unbelievably bad and almost un-watchable. The audio is even worse with a constant hissing noise that will have you wanting to cut your ears off in minutes rather than sit through it. The only extras on the disc are a bunch of trailers for some other equally bad looking movies. Overall this DVD is a joke and a total waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and pick up a VHS copy for a fraction of the price...trust me, you'll thank me you did."
4,Worth the price for the information but,"I have been working with cancer patients and visualization/meditation for over 20 years. I learned things in the introduction that were new and helpful to me. I found the quality of the author's voice, however, anything but relaxing. I'd recommend the same scripts and music but using someone who has a more relaxing and pleasing voice. I love the music on the second CD but found the vocals on them intrusive and slightly annoying. I am glad I bought these CD's and would recommend them for the information in the introduction alone. However, I will not be using them for meditation."
1,Dolly doesn't care about people. Not really.,"My mother was passing so I made a play list from YouTube. When I tried to find the songs for individual sale, none were available. The only way I could purchase the songs were to buy ""Dolly's entire cds."" at inflated prices. Low down and dirty marketing strategies, Dolly! I will boycott DollyWood and will never support Dolly and her boob jobs or her wigs again. Using gospel songs for profit is no different than Judas selling out Jesus. God gave you a great talent and you exploit it for $! DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, DOLLY? Very disappointed in you!"
1,disappointed,"With the long list of well-loved gospel oldies on this CD, I was sorely disappointed in its musical arrangement. Dolly grew up with this music,as did I, but it was presented in a totally different style than one is used to hearing. Too much percussion and vocal chorus and not enough stringed instruments, and the way in which the songs were sung was uninspiring spiritually. I enjoy Dolly's voice and much of her music, but this one, for me, was disappointing.To each his own, I know that there are some who will like this style, but I could not even bring myself to listen to each song all the way through.Old gospel country/bluegrass sounds best sung the way it used to be. But again, there are some who would probably find no fault with this CD."
2,Less XML-Databases and more opensource,"This book is not an application development guide. But it mentions about some *open source* tools and covers some API available in Perl, Java and C towards the end of the book. And the rest of the book is filled with descriptions of other open source tools, not completely irrelevant, but probably you were not looking for and distracting.If you are just looking for some description of tools or guide to use tools available, I suggest just you spend the time the web and you get lot more useful information than presented in this book.Even when the author talked about XML Databases, he is mostly interested in Document Management not the data. He did not do justice to the data that can be presented/stored in XML/Database."
2,Where was the editor?,"This book has some useful information, though it suffers from lack of editing. I thought that a draft copy accidently went to press when I started reading this. Many of the errors in this book are typos, but some of the errors have more to do with presentation and may confuse the reader about the topic.Open Source XML Database Toolkit does have useful information. Its strength is that it is geared to help readers understand how XML, DBMSs, and all the middleware fit together.XML and other computer markup and languages use esoteric symbols and naming devices; it is crucial that technical books about these topics get them right consistently. This book doesn't do that, which is why I have given it 2/5 stars. Informative (thus far in my reading), but -3 for poor editing."
1,Join the modern world!,I'm not sorry this product is no longer being produced. It is extremely simple to print out pictures in black and white from a good digital camera. Join the modern world and forget about antiques like black and white film!
2,Doesn't know what it wants to be,"Some cute, quirky people featured in here. Shows the emotional need that gardening can often fulfill. When describing strangers, the author spins interesting and compelling stories. Unfortunately, when she writes about her family and friends, she loses her thread and the tales become self-indulgent and unfocused."
1,To bad,I receive this battery in a old pack .... So the battery never work ... yes I receive a dead battery :(
5,Works great in my DXG590V camcorder!,Works great in my DXG590V camcorder. Great price and lasts as long or even a little longer than the battery that came with the camcorder. Excellent NP-120 battery.
3,Pure Rhetoric,"Few subjects have produced more twaddle in print than the current, regrettable fad of decontructionist staging of opera, and this book is no exception. Like flappers and disco, this too shall pass. The current generation of opera producers have grown up with television and commercials. They have the attention span of a gnat. One suspects that they have never taken the time to read Shakespeare's plays or the Bible. Their style of opera consists of a random jumble of visual elements and designs taken from disparate sources, cultures, and time periods. Mr. Sutcliffe has been a British opera critic for a very long time and has seen the ebb and flow of many trends in the opera house. His book would be more valuble if he had concentrated on documenting rather than trying to justify the off-the-wall staging of opera."
3,Recipe Flops,"I have made two recipes from this cookbook and the first one, Grandma's Saucy Meat Loaf, was great!! The second one I made, Chicken and Dressing, was really disappointing. It came out really soupy and the stuffing was all bloated. I will try again because I think the idea is good but next time cut out the liquids.Since the first recipe turned out so well I am going to give some other recipes a try"
1,Disappointing recipes,"This is a cute idea for a book, and its done with a nice format and layout. However my wife and I are disappointed with the recipes, as many of them rely on processed foods, canned soups, and powdered mixes for flavor. Some also require things to be cooked separately before being added to the pot, and/or use things like canned beans, and are not taking advantage of the crock pot cooking method in my opinion. Although we only tried one recipe for pasta with ground beef (and actually our one-year old liked it) I'm not sure we will make another recipe from this book."
1,Don't buy Kindle version!!,"This is not the complete book. Many of the recipes have ingredients with asterisks after them. The asterisks let you know of substitutions that you might like to use, rather than the original ingredient listed. On the Kindle version, you certainly see the asterisk after the ingredient in the recipe, but you have no idea what the asterisk means. Until publishers, and Amazon, stop ripping people off in this way, I'll stick with the print version."
2,Starved: mercy for Eating Disorders,Amazon did not mention that this is a CHRISTIAN based book and the philosophy is based on biblical references. I guess the Mercy series of recovery books is all christian based. I found that offensive and returned the book.
5,"Real stories, encouragement for many","I've read Nancy Alcorn before and she continues to share the REAL deal. This book contains real stories--it differs from your other pop culture books because the stories share answers to the tough problems, not just ""learn how to live with your problems and live a functional life."" Thanks for providing another resource for devestating issue of eating disorders--I know it will help many."
5,This is my son's favorite mac n cheese,We go through plenty of Mac n cheese at our house and my son and friends seem hooked on this one. They also like the Shells and White Cheddar but this one is most asked for. I buy it using Amazon's subscribe and save and it works out best for us.
5,better than hamburger helper,"This is very good, my husband loved it too. Doesn't taste like it came from a box and is definately better than the hamburger helper version. I added salsa and ground venison and it was a really easy dinner."
1,Only one song worth,"I bought this CD only for Me and Mrs Jones, hoping some of the rest worth it. Didn't like the rest at all."
5,great talent,billy paul was more than one song.he can sing with emotion&feeling.this set highlights his great talent.a very powerful voice who is very underrated.
3,Could've been better,Billy Paul released some songs that are omitted here. Not a good complication from Sony Music's Legacy Series. A waste.
2,my opiinion,"Purchased merely to obtain his recording of ""Me and Mrs.Jones"". However, the entire CD is not to my taste, but I am sure true fans of Billy Paul will be very appreciative of what is obviously a well produced, professional CD."
4,Mrs. Jones,"I bought this CD for the title sone. Some of the other songs are OK, but the title song is probably the best known Billy Paul song - and it is great!!!"
4,Billy at his best from 1971-76.,"Unfortunately, most of Billy Paul's early Philadelphia International LPs have yet to be reissued on CD--which is shameful as they rank among the classiest recordings which the label ever issued. Billy Paul was strongly influenced by such great Jazz crooners as Nat King Cole and Billy Eckstine--not surprisingly, he brought a degree of class and sophistication to the ""Philly Sound"" that only Lou Rawls would be able to duplicate. This CD offera a very fine (if incomplete) overview of his 1971-76 recordings. NOTE: If anyone from Sony Legacy reads this review I urge you to consider reissuing Billy's ""Going East"" and ""Feeling Good At The Cadillac Club"" on CD."
5,Be careful who you love...,"A terrific story of alterior motives, and how your love can be used against you with near deadly results. Ralph Briarwood has etched himself as one of the greatest villains in literary history. I had to admit it was not until the last twenty or thirty pages did I finally, truly suspect him of foul play.When Edgars described the topography it was as if I were there, and could practically taste the surroundings. And she has proven, that sometimes the seemingly helpless woman is not so helpless. If not for the schoolmarm, Flo would've been at the bottom of the ravine just as her aunts.Riveting!"
2,Joint Cream,"Couldn't tell any difference by using it. When I try a product, i like to feel it working. Would not recommend this product."
4,Awesome Travel Bag,"Just got back from my 1st trip to Asia with this bag. It worked great! I travel with several sets of 11x17 drawings, project files, laptop, power adapters, etc... All this stuff adds up to a lot of weight that really takes a toll on my back and shoulders. This bag carried it all through airports and meetings with no problems."
3,BIG!!,"This case is extremely large, but not really set up to fit more than a computer, papers, and a change of light clothing. It is far too large for the storage space you get. Because of its size, it also must be ""gate checked"" at the airport if you are on a smaller plane. Since gate checking a computer is not advisable, this means you must carry the computer along with any other items you need on the flight. Not a great deal! I'm returning it."
3,"Very big, but lacks space",I bought this based on others reviews saying it fit all their business papers. I use both paper and binders and this bag does not provide a lot of space for both. Also I have an iPad and computer which is also doesn't offer a ton of space for your computer. I would buy a different one if I could.
4,Ok with it.,"Ok with it, big enough inside, but it is too big looking from outside. Too heavy for a lady to carry it."
4,Good bag for Dell Alienware m17x Laptop Gaming Computer,"This is a good bag for a large laptop/notebook. I bought it for my Dell Alienware m17x, which is a huge, heavy laptop computer.Pros:-KEY FEATURE FOR ME. I did not want to ""advertise"" the presence of my m17x, so I shunned all of the ""Dell"" or ""Alienware"" bags/packs. The Targus bag is non-descriptive, and looks like any other rolling briefcase. Sure it probably has a laptop, but probably a crappy corporate hand-me-down. :)-It fits the Dell Alienware m17x well.-It has many good specialty pockets and pouches for all your stuff. There is a large compartment for files or even clothes.-The telescoping handles are sturdy, and the wheels roll smooth and soft like roller-blade wheels.Cons:-The computer compartment is not padded as well as I would have liked. I am going to get some more padding.Summary:-The m17x fits. It looks like a regular bag. The price is right. It is constructed well."
4,More like a suitcase that has a laptop sleve,"Got this to replace carrying both a laptop bag and a rolling carry-on. It's HUGE, it does have a shoulder strap, but you won't want to use it very often. It's the same size as the 20"" rolling carry-on I used to travel with.For me, it holds all the typical business travel gear (laptop, a few files, etc) as well as a solid couple of night's worth of clothing (the back compartment is clearly intended for clothing, even has a couple of straps for holding stuff in place). The front compartment has numerous well designed pockets with velcro closures to keep things organized, which prevents stuff from getting lost in the large compartment. The laptop section is a bit light on padding, I feel. The version I received has added a dedicated ipad pocket inside the laptop compartment, which is kind of nifty. Overall a great bag, it's certainly fulfilled it's purpose."
1,"Not compatible with all 17"" laptops","My Toshiba Satellite X205-SLI6 17"" Laptop does not fit into the padded sleeve provided with this laptop. Very disappointing, since I checked the dimensions before buying. My laptop's size is 15.7"" x 11.3"" x 1.42"" /2.05"", and the Targus website says that device compatibility for this product is 16.5"" x 2.25"" x 13""."
3,Targus rolling Laptop case,"I purchased this case for my 17"" laptop that I use for business. It is the second Targus case that I have. I do not use it for travel and therefore the 4"" ""luggage"" space is mostly wasted space. The bag is OK but has a couple shortcomings. There is no good space for storing the 110 volt power unit and the cord. I put it in the mesh bag but, that is not very good. The space to hold the laptop is OK but I had to create a method to hold the laptop secure as this is not a standard part of the case. The only thing I dislike about the case the that the zipper that opens the area that holds the laptop does not allow it to open all the way. This makes using this area a little inconvenient. As for the handle and the rolling capability, it performs very well."
1,Arrived with a sliced front,"This case arrived with a 10"" slice across the front. The plastic protective cover was not cut, so it appeared the slice occurred at the factory or packer. The bag was returned immediately and Amazon refunded the cost immediately. I ordered another bag later."
4,Great for travel,"The Targus CityGear Rolling Travel Case has plenty of room for my laptop, small projector, and all of the computer accessories necessary for me to provide training while on travel. I always take my travel case with me on the airplane and on the larger planes the case fits easily in the overhead above the seats. On smaller planes the case usually fits comfortably under the seat in front of me. The price I received from Amazon was fantastic compared to other places I researched."
1,revieogen shampoo and conditioner,Did not use this product. I actually did a search for a specific product and did not notice this was not the product I was looking for.
2,"Lost more hair, but the remaining is soft as ever.","After using this product and then the shampoo/conditioner afterwards, I noticed that I lost more hair in the shower than ever before. After a month I noticed visibly less hair than before I started this treatment. The remaining hair is as soft and healthy as can be, and even adds a little body to the hair.In all, I would recommend the shampoo and conditioner, but not the ""scalp treatment"". The strength, body and feel of the shampoo/conditioner is great, but the scalp treatment was time consuming, awkward, and seemed to have the opposite effect than advertised."
3,Not enough sequins provided....,"Good project if you have time to work on it. If you take your time it comes out beautiful! Only complaint is it did not have enough sequins to complete the project. I had to write to the company. They did send me enough to complete, but it took time and it was rather annoying that they didn't provide the proper quantity to being with!"
2,Master Crafters Only,"I ordered this item thinking it would be a fun project for a Christmas gift. It should have come with a warning -- only purchase if you do a lot of crafts and have an endless amount of time. I spent 3 hours cutting out all the various small pieces, but was only halfway finished. And that's just cutting it out. Never mind all the sewing and the teeny tiny sequins and beads. I abandoned it, went to Etsy and purchased a personalized stocking for only $10 more than this kit cost. Uff da! Never again!It didn't help that I lost so much time waiting for it to arrive. Took more than a week! And then this $16 item required a signature, so someone had to be here for it!I gave it a 2 because the quality of the fabric seems nice. But good Lord, who has the time??? Seriously, they need to change the description so it states it is difficult and requires a high level of skill (and patience)!"
4,Hello!,"Almost all Ranma episodes i have seen are very funny or have a really really cute ranma in it, so if you like ranma as much as any fanatic... there is no-risk in buying this. And what's a little money for entertainment?"
1,Oldest package ever,This package looks like it is from 1980. There is nothing about BPA free on this it was made so long ago. There is no way I would use these on my girls.
4,"Fresh, interesting display of talent.","This isn't the ""quickest listen"" I've ever had, but I was caught by the level of talent I heard on the first listen and after another two or three I was hooked. Fiction is obviously into prooving wrong the old ""rock is dead"" adage. Using the classic tools of the trade, a gift for hooks and melody and a willingness to blow off the path of least resistance, Fiction has made a disc that keeps on giving. My favorite tracks are ""Square"", ""Six Lanes To Nowhere"", ""Freedom Song"" and ""Fly Away"". Blue-eyed R&B for the next 1000 years!"
3,Magic Slim Lite,"Unfortunately, this is what Chicago's baddest bluesman sounds like when he's been defanged. Better to start your collection with ""Snakebite"" or the classic ""Gravel Road."" Time marches on and this is not the same band without John Primer and Nick Holt. One star added for including the PC video."
1,not really quaternion physics,"The authors synopsis is as follows:""This work links Egyptian Philosophy, Physics and Quaternion Mathematics. The Egyptians saw science as the study of God's Works, a spiritual activity bringing one closer to the Divine. the Egyptian Civilization was built upon Righteousness - Right Actions and Right Angles. A Grand Unification Theory is introduced based upon a Life quaternion and a quaternion Spactime change operator""This book contains a number of assertions, many in equation form but contains no diagrams, illustrations or explanations. It was my hope in purchasing it that it would present an explanation and development of quaternions which would contrast with a Gibbs-Heaviside approach and/or a Geometric Algebra approach ( ala Hestenes ) . Alas this book has nothing to do with the development of quaternions.I have learned that indeed one should not judge or purchase a book based upon it's cover (or title). It's amazing how useful those old maxims can be."
2,Very basic,"I have been a big fan of dividend investing for years. Generally its not exciting but its dependable. Its often the only money you get to see in a share for a long time.A plus is as the writer states is the market goes down the shares rarely drop that much as it reaches a point where people will buy it just for the dividend rate.Having made this one observation, a few times in his book, you will find that if you know something about shares then there is little new or orginal here.By the way the negative about dividend investing is what this writer does not tell you is if the company has a bad year and cuts its dividend, then the price can drop dramatically. So you still can get burnt badly."
5,A Must-Have Item!!,"If you tie flies, then you must have this book. I can't imagine a question that could be asked about the art of fly tying that this book does not answer. Get a copy now!!"
5,The Fly Tier's Benchside Reference,"A must book for any fly tier. If you buy a book on fly tying this should be the one. Outstanding quality, and at Anazon price is a great buy."
4,smaller,smaller than the book and as interresting and cheapern.Can take it with you where ever you want . Used it many times .
3,A real benchside reference guide,Is a good reference for tying techniques.I would have preferred if I could find the entire dressings and not only the hundred plus one techniques to tie wings or whatever but probably it would have become too big.To be improved in CDC use.
3,half a reference,"nothing on any actual patterns, nothing on saltwater, a lot of editorial dribble that gets very tiring. It would seem that a deskside reference should include some of the above mentioned. maybe my mistaken expectations."
5,An amazingly concise book on the art of fly tying.,"This book is a must own for the beginner and advanced flytier. The bright close-up pictures and the many diverse ways of tying everything from bodies to wings make this a book that you will not want to put down, especially during your tying season."
5,Absolutely amazing,"Offers technique upon technique, from the simplest to the most complex. Step by step instructions and photos cover the minutest of details. I've been tying for ten years, and this reference will change the way I tie, cleaning up just about every one of my ties."
1,got rip off,the movie not look like shown on the cover and it just some idiot fake zombie trying to kill people .DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Outstanding Series,"I love the X-files-string-you-along series. It was my Favorite until Sleeper Cell came along. Anyone who is into Tom Clancy or Terrorist themes will love this series. Keiffer makes this show. Without him, 24 would suck."
1,Did she even do /ANY/ Research?,"What she wrote in the book essentially slanders skinheads. Unfortunately, she is simply being a woman of her time - after all, there has been little to no media coverage that has portrayed skinheads as being anything but violent hatemongers and nazi stormtroopers.Skinheads, in reality, are not by nature racist. The movement was started by Whites as well Jamaican and Carribbean islanders in the late sixties. It didn't start with the White Aryan Brotherhood or the Hammerskins. It started as just a bunch of working-class blokes having a good time.However, hate and shock sell these days, so making skinheads out do be anything good simply won't make a profit. I think that without a doubt, skinheads have been the most slandered of any subculture to date."
2,You get what you pay for,"What the reviewer below me said is correct. These speakers do seem to be very sensitive when adjusting the volume control. The sub woofer does not seem to have any issues, but towers do. When I just adjust the volume knob it can suddenly have a sharp, static noise come in and out. I have checked the connections as well as various volume controls within the Windows XP and Windows Media Player volume controls. Despite trying different adjustments they just are not ""smooth"" in any sense of the word. Fortunately I did not spend a fortune on them. Shop around and look for another alternative, because if you are like me and like to at least listen to some tunes when working at your computer, these are not the best option."
2,"Pretty, But Useless","The only reason I gave two stars for these speakers is because they have pretty blue lights when they are turned on. However, the blue lights sometimes flicker and dim for no reason, or extinguish completely.The volume control is useless- move it the slightest bit to either side and the volume is either at the maximum or minimum. There is no in-between.Another problem I'm going to list is that static is a constant factor, and every couple minutes there's a loud popping noise and the blue lights flicker.This is a very bad product!! Don't waste your money!!"
1,Don't buy this,"Once every few seconds, there is a blast of static. This is not a true review, but don't waste your money."
2,Disappointing,"I read one other JCO book called ""The Falls""- which I loved. In comparison, this book was long winded and lacked the depth that drew me into The Falls. The reader has no empathy for the characters and just when you think maybe something will come of all of it, the book ends rather abruptly."
4,Oates and Roth,"I've seen reviews which suggest the ""hero"" of Oates novel, which is dedicated to Philip Roth, is based on PR himself. I was reminded of Roth's novel The Human Stain. These two books seemed to me a sort of Point Counterpoint. Has anyone else seen a connection? [. . .]"
3,"Good, But a Little Long","Like many readers here, I first encountered Oates though her short stories which I have found to be compelling and wonderfully written. I found this book to be one of her best short stories. Unfortunately, it is a 307 page novel, not a short story. Oates had a great idea, interesting plot, realistic characters (especially, and sadly, Jet), subtle message, and, as usual, wonderful use of language (I have not read any of Oates' poems, but intend to now).The story was just too damn long: Two-thirds of the way into the book, I kept thinking ""get on with it, Carol! We get the idea! Appearances! Bigotry! Destiny! Move it on!"" It was all I could do not to flip to the last chapter (a peach of an ending, I might add).It all could have been said in 70 pages, to much greater effect, especially with the evocative language skills that Oates has at her disposal.Well, on to my next Oates novel!"
2,epic fail,"Many people have described the plot so I will describe why I didn't like the book overall.First, the character of Dmitri served no real purpose to me. Secondly, they made so much of the tattoos but never explained them and they never became important. Thirdly, Alma's slow realization that she didn't hate him and that he loved her happened too quickly with hardly any development. The fact that he converted to Christianity does not mean he's not culturally Jewish, either, so if Alma truly were an anti-Semite, for her, he still would've counted as a Jew. What was the significance of chess in the story? The moment of epiphany was rather weak. The character of Siegl was not at all good for his age. Her stupidity was something that Joyce Carol Oates used at whim...sometimes she was pretty smart other times, she was dumb as a rock. Not cool. Finally, the ending was rather random and a real let down. His relationship with his sister had a lot of potential but she failed all around in this book."
3,Disappointed,"I wasn't sure about this book when I started it, but I stuck with it. Others have described the plot of this book, so I'll skip that. I found it interesting that the story would jump from character to character and you got to understand the mental processes of all of the characters. I was rooting for the transformation of Alma. After her horrific childhood and adult years, it was gratifying to see her slowly realize that there is another way to live. I was just terribly disappointed with the ending. What was the point? It ends abruptly with nothing positive coming out of this story. I felt cheated."
3,It appeared a little contrived and superficial.,"My experience of reading this novel epitomizes the meaning of the expression, ""The higher one's expectations, the greater the disappointment"". No doubt Joyce is a great writer, but ""The Tattooed Girl"" certainly falls short of her best efforts. The writer seeks to explore the themes of anti-Semitism, the fleeting and impermanent nature of one's identity, and the irrational origins of hatred. The lead-up to the conflict took Joyce almost two-thirds of the book, yet the resolution was a lame attempt at hitting home her intended message.""The Tattooed Girl"" is likely to be on the reading list for Joyce's diehard fans, but for others, it may end up as a book which failed to move. Go for Joyce's other novels instead. I believe they will salvage your impression of her."
3,*Miss. O* O.K. I guess... *Miss. O*,"In this novel by Joyce Carol Oates, an aging ex-prodigy and author is in need of assistance, and starts to (secretly) try to find an assistant. After going through several interviews, Joshua Seigl isn't happy with any of the possible candidates. Seigl gave up searching until he met Alma Busch in a bookstore. She seemed like a good person for the job; although it turns out she is illiterate. This book tells the tale of this mixed-matched pair from a third-person writing of each of their views on their lives - interaction with each other and others.I suppose if I were older, this book might be more appealing, for the writing is good. It is a bit advanced I guess - that or the stress of finishing the book before a deadline - for my age because it felt difficult to read at times. I recommend this novel to older, more advanced-level-reading students, but not to younger, less advanced level students.-- >> Kathy White"
1,big ideas,"I think unfortunately...that this book had a great premise, but failed to deliver a cohesively written work. Too many large words filled space which was unneccessary and character plots were ridiculous. the book ended where it may have begun....very disappointing"
1,so controversial,"I once read a review that said this was Joyce's most controversial novel to date. So, I gave it a shot. I'd read one short story by her that I really liked. However, this novel was practicaly unreadable. I mean... there were english words and sentences, but it was very cumbersome for some reason. I didn't think the writing was tight at all. So, I didn't finish it. I think the only thing controversial about it was how boring it was."
5,Hitachi finish nails,"I am very pleased with this Hitachi finish nails.I have bought Hitachi products before and they deliver excellent quality.This nails shoot straight,firm and with-out any jam in the nailer."
4,This book was indeed a hair-raiser!,"""A Curse on Elizabeth"" was pretty good. It wasn't as good as most of the Sweet Valley Kids books though. Liz was knocked out when she, Jessica, and the rest of the second-grade class went to the museum. It has been a long time since I read this book, but I still remember it well. I recommend it to you."
5,It sure is SPOOKY!!!,"I've read A curse on Elizabeth a million times but I never get less surprised when I read it.Jessica and Elizabeth are going on a trip to the mueusum with their class and teacher.The muesum has become the center of excitement in the town because of the famous Egptition Exhibition.The twins are really excited,but will they find more than just exhibits and mummiefied paroahs?Find out yourself in ""A curse on Elizabeth""."
2,Duraline is not Duable,"I'm looking for an alternative this Homelite DuraLine trim line. These never seem to last very long. I only spend about 8 minutes trimming around stone walls, a concrete patio and wire mesh fence. Although I try to keep the line off the stone and concrete, this line only lasts for 2 trimmings before gets pretty worn down and breaks. It always breaks off before it wears all the way down. Am I expecting too much?"
5,"Sexy, fun, and so much more!","IT'S A GUY THING, is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Readers who want a sexy, fast-paced read with witty dialogue will not be disappointed, since this book has all that. But it has so much more. I really identified with Cassie as she struggled to be her own person, and rooted for Guy as he tried to show her she could have love without surrendering her sense of self. The scenes between them were hot enough to burn up the pages, but they were also humorous, touching, and quite imaginative. I'll never look at Squabble, foot massage, or chocolate the same! If you want a really great read, give this book a try!"
3,Gripping setting but finally unfocussed and unengaging,"Some advance publicity on Robert Bingham made me eager to read this novel, and at first I was held in a kind of thrall by Phnom Penh, a city I recognized every step of the way in his initial descriptions, for it is a city I know. Yet the characters fail to grip the heart or mind. A kind of scattered expat sensibility develops and some atmosphere works, but Bingham is just getting near some kind of heart of darkness in this first novel. Of course with Bingham's early death there can be no development of the book's undeniable promise. Yes, there is promise and a murky kind of 90's pessimism, but comparisons to Graham Greene or Conrad are, in my view, unjustified."
3,"Beautifully written, kept me interested but..",".. I found the whole story too based on coincidence. The chance meetings in Cambodia I could some what accept but those in NY did not work. The story was too choppy, the characters did not evoke any sympathy from me, the college/speech sequences went too long and no where (yes yes I know it shows that our hero no longer fits - hit me with a sledgehammer). Too similar and far less powerful a book than Stone's ""Dog Soldiers""."
4,A Good Summer Read,"I was very disillusioned by several of the other reviews of this book --in the main, most people seem to malign it while I have been recommending it to many of my friends as a good summer read --yes, it has some ""holes"" in the plot and there are some inexplicable coincidences but, overall, I found it very intense and engrossing and I felt the sense of alientation thatBingham must have experienced during his tenure in Cambodia and during his brief life -- so, I still, in spite of all the somewhat negative reviews I read would recommend this book as a good summer read."
3,Derivative Soldiers,"If you change the time, the locations, the names and the occupations of the players the first half of this book is an updated Dog Soldiers. Unfortunately Lightning on the Sun isn't nearly as good. The reference to the hassassini seems to have been lifted from an old David Morrell spy novel. Glen, the knife wielding dwarf, is right out of Chinatown. All that apart Bingham wrote well and certainly maintains interest with the quirky dialogue of his main characters. The plot, though, is far too contrived. The idea of the troubled lovers going to the beach by the train in a strife torn Cambodia was just ridiculous. As indeed was the character of the self absorbed, vacuous Julie. It was only right she was sent back to the Los Angeles which she hated so much."
5,Lightning on the Sun - Bingham,"Lightning on the Sun delivers a fairly standard drug-deal-gone-bad story but its unique in that it takes place largely in Cambodia. Because of this unique setting, Lightning on the Sun becomes a highly-charged thriller. What truly separates this novel from others in the same genre is the fact that Bingham is obviously familiar with the historical, political and social intricacies of daily life in Cambodia. Add to that well developed characters and you're left with a powerful, fascinating story."
4,Raw Emotion,"I think this book has a really good flow to it. Every few chapters are grouped together into smaller stories, which, when added together, make for a page-turning novel. Bingham does a good job getting the reader to experience the main character Asher's drug experiences right along with him. This book is a good advertisement for why you shouldn't do heroin. Though the ending was somewhat predictable, the desperation of the characters and Bingham's raw desciptions of what's going on in their heads (aided by various legal and illegal substances) makes this a book I really recommend."
4,Zen and Cambodia,"If you haven't been to Cambodia, there are a lot of things that you probably won't pick up on. It is a quick read, that is, you won't want to put it down and not finish it. The plot comes down to fate -- the fate of a young man living on the edge in Southeast Asia.Mike Zinsley,author of the Rapture of the Deep"
1,lousy dog soldiers imitation,"I grew really fed up with this novel, and the rather banal nihilism of its characters. What is the source of their disaffection? Their priviledged upbringings, for the most part. It's hard to take that sort of anomie seriously, and it becomes insufferable, after a certain point, to endure their existential angst. Versus Stone's ""Dog Soldiers,"" which I'd read before and am now in the process of re-reading. He presents a much, fuller, richer perspective on the overall disaffection of American culture at the time, and how Vietnam played into the moral landscape of the nation. Granted, Stone wrote his novel in a more tumultuous period. Still, ""Soldiers"" delves into broader issues in a considered manner, whereas Bingham never seems to transcend the trope of spoiled, rich, nihilistic 30-somethings. Which -- not coincidentally -- is exactly who Bingham was."

4,A little TVP history here...Too bad they cut the best song,"1991. Kalamazoo Michigan. The band (or at least the key elements) was then called ""Jonnie with an Eye"" and they often played at a bar called Ricks on the campus of Western Michigan. End of the show, Brian Vander Ark came on stage alone with just a guitar and sang ""The Freshman."" Then and there I said this song is top 40 all the way. I was stunned to hear so good a band playing a campus bar.This album, originally self produced at a studio in Grand Rapids, originally had three additional songs including the accoustic, non-commercialized ""The Freshman"". The RCA version now available has the first 7 tracks, but it's a serious shame that version of The Freshman never got out.But this ablum does have some excellent VP tunes from the VERY early days. ""I've Suffered A Head Injury"" is a brilliant slam on Vanilla Ice and ""oceanside"" and ""ark of the envious"" are also excellent.I'll save my ancient original CD. But you should get this one."
5,College Sound Track,"I saw this band my freshman year at Club Soda in Kalamazoo Michigan and was blown away. I have loved this album since it was released (thier first). For those of you that were introduced to TVP with Villians you need to go back and buy this album.The Freshman debuted on this album and is later known as 'the fast version' (in concert atlease I have heard Brian refer to it as this) and is the most raw of the three or four recorded versions I have heard. Excellent.One of my greatest memories was singing along to Martyr Material in concert at ""The State Theatre"" in Kalamazoo, MI with a pile of my friends.I cannot say enough about this freshman appearance by a chronically underrated band.TF"
2,Not very impressive,"After hearing the wonderful Pop Smear album, I decided to dig even deeper into the Verve Pipe archives and gave ""I've Suffered a Head Injury"" a whirl. I was not impressed in the least. The album lacks the passion and emotion that makes the Verve Pipe stand out from the rest. This is a plain, ordinary album, which cannot boast a good song besides ""Ark of the Envious"". The Verve Pipe has shown much maturity over the years and to trace them all the way back to this album was exciting.. I was disappointed, but it's still great to listen to for Verve Pipe fans."
4,"A fantastic CD, even without The Freshmen","Yeah so the original version of the Freshmen was taken off this CD in order to put a re-recorded version of it on their major label debut ""Villians"". They removed two other tracks sung by former lead guitarist Brian Stout as well.HOWEVER, even without those three tracks, this is still not only a must-have for all Verve Pipe fans, but a must-have for rock lovers everywhere. In my opinion, this is TVP's second best album (behind Pop Smear and ahead of Villians)."
2,Cantina diorama with sandtrooper,"SAVE YOUR MONEY people! I just bought this cantina ""set"" at a flea market unopened for my son who is six years old. The sandtrooper is cool, but the cantina itself it BOOTLEG! It's a piece of flimsy THIN cardboard that has trouble staying together. I am looking for scotch tape as of now to tape it so it will hold. I'll look at the other possible cantina sets if available. Hopefully they won't be so GHETTO!"
4,very sturdy and substantial,"arrieved on time and as described,the stool broke 18 months after purchase and could not be fixed. i would purchase this item again ."
1,"Barna has left ""the system""",I think George Barna would probably not recommend this book any longer considering his current view of the Institutional Church system. Please read my review of his book Revolution (2005).
4,good,"these books are great but if you've never experience labor pain, there's no way to prepare yourself for it, and no way to determine how it will feel for your body. additionally, depending on the position of your baby, each labor will feel different."
2,Not loving the book so far..,"I'm 8 month pregnant and found out I can't have an epidural due to a medical condition, so I started looking for ways to deal with labor pains. I bought this book based on the reviews, but it turns out the book has too much blah blah and like statistics and stories, and in my opinion it doesn't get to the point.I'm looking for actual ways to help my labor, not the story of how one lady's labor was painful, but the other lady's labor wasn't. It doesn't even tell you what this lady did to help the pain, just describes the pain... like I get it, it's gonna be painful, just tell me how to deal with it!I also bought ""Active Labor"" which I've been reading at the same time, and I like that one so much better!"
2,Dissappointing,"Although this book does aim at covering all the options with dealing with the pain of labor, most of the options presented seem ineffective and / or unrealistic -- leaving the only ""true"" form of pain relief to be medication, which is my goal to avoid. Lots of stuffing, no meat."
5,The most comprehensive,"This is the ONLY book I've been able to find that covers all aspects of mobile development. That it covers HDML and voiceXML is quite nice. There are sections on migrating HDML to WML, and on designing mobile applications, also very helpful.For my money, this is the WAP book to own. The cover certainly is goofy, though :-)."
3,"Content good, index bad","Although I basically agree with the other review of this book, I wanted to point out that the index could use some work. For example, I wanted to find a particular WML tag in the index and couldn't find it. Finally, I noticed that there was an index entry called ""WML elements"" and the tag I needed was *subindexed* under that.I think that each tag needs to have a separate entry if the index is going to be seriously useful. In a reference book like this one, it's important."
1,Made me Vomit! I take creatine and this did not fit well with my body :(,"I am usually buying the best rated products and sadly I am very dissapointed about this, Im 25 years old and I puked within 7-9 minutes of taking this. Sorry but, not what I want from a creatine. I am sticking to my usual beast creatine 300mg. Never failed me, sorry MM Femme Hi energy....Thumbs Down."
1,This is definately a pricing mistake.,"This is definately a pricing mistake.The description states that: ""This gizmo is very small and runs on solar power.""What?? Runs on Solar Power! And its only $8.50 per 6oz. Box. Ha..."
5,A MUST FOR CHRISTIAN MUSIC FANS,"This is a wonderful CD. Los himnos son magnificos, la letra impresionante, y la voz de Dani, poderosa, me llega al alma. Los arreglos musicales, ni hablar. Lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que guste del estilo pop/rock con letra Cristiana que te habla al corazón. Y si pueden ver a Dani en concierto, mejor aun, es una experiencia increible."
1,Someone is on Drugs,"If you total Up The 4 DVD's the cost Is 182.74, And The Cost For The 1-4 Season Is $245.95 To $269.99Whats Up With That?When You Buy All 4 Together Should They Not Be Cheaper?"
1,Getting a bit long in the tooth,"I hate to give only one star to a recording that in its day was something special, and Berlin Classics are doing us all a favour in digitally remastering Mauersberger's Schutz. For example the only readily available version of the St. Luke Passion is Mauersberger's 1968 recording with Peter Schreier as the Evangelist and Theo Adam as Jesus (BC 0092072). But even at mid-price there is little reason to get excited about another reissued selection from Psalms of David. Summerly's excellent 1995 super-budget recording on Naxos (8.553044), or Bernius' complete set on DHM, and no doubt the forthcoming Junghanel set as well, are all a better way to get to know Schutz' most famous opus."
5,Please sort out for US dvd players!!,I'm from the States but live in Ireland and have seen ponderland and love it!!! It is hilarious and I am dying to buy it for family and friends in the US so please get it sorted so it can be played on US dvd players!!
2,Chinese Junk,"Another example of American brands outsourcing to China. These parts say ""Made in China"". They look OK but the metalurgy is inferior, made from recycled scrap.These are brakes, a critical safety component, not a cheap decorative lamp. Parts arrived beat up, not properly packaged, dents in surfaces from metal to metal contact. Would not repeat purchase.Lesson learned, buy where you can inspect the part prior to purchase. It may cost more but you will save in the long run. And just might save your life in the case of critical brake parts."
3,14 more rare Soul oldies.,"By itself, Debbie Taylor's dramatic ballad ""Never Gonna Let Him Know"" justifies buying this CD but other nice Soul rarities featured here include Top Shelf's ""Give It Up"", Tony Mason's ""Lovely Weekend"", ""Eddie Holman's ""Just Another Guy"" and Linda Jones' ""It Won't Take Much"". As with volumes three and five of this series some tracks have terrible sound quality but the track and artist selection is so unique that I recommend it to all who love rare oldies."
4,Thimbleberries Christmas gifts and quilted ideas,Great book. Lots of great ideas. Christmas presents for this coming Christmas look real good. Lynette make the instructions easy to follow.As with all of her projects and patterns they are fun to do and a joy to receive.
1,WARNING: NO PATTERNS WORTH MY TIME,"This was just a disappointment from the word go. I was expecting patterns and the few that were provided were mundane craft items, and not any quilts at all. This was a hustle pure and simple."
2,Doesn't even have pattern for quilt on cover!,Very disappointing book. Only has patterns for 6 quilts & there are 4 times this many quilts shown in book. I thought it was really bad that the quilt shown on the front cover was not even in the book. At the end of the book are listed sources for 17 of the quilts shown in the book telling you that you have to buy other books &/or patterns if you want patterns for those quilts! Shame on you Lynnette Jensen.
2,NOT WORTH IT,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. I especially wanted the pattern for the quilt that is prominently shown on the book cover only to discover it was simply mentioned as the author's first pattern for Thimbleberries and no pattern was included. There were other quilts shown as well that didn't include a pattern. Even with directions and patterns given for the other crafts and baked goodies this book was, overall, very disappointing."
4,good textbook,"This is a good textbook, but it is a textbook nevertheless. It covers all key topics and provides good examples. A good introductory text for someone considering a career in tourism. I'd also recommend Kotler's Hospitality and Tourism and Raza's Heads in Beds."
5,"Love the ""Don""","I have been a coffee drinker for many years. Tried many of the gourmet coffees, as the previous reviewer. Was a customer of Green Mountain, Gevalia, even local handmade roasts. When we recently were visiting in Phoenix, I picked up some groceries, including coffee. I saw this brand and had not had it before, so decided to try it and I have fallen for it, completely. It is so smooth and delicious. If my local grocer won't carry it, I will be buying it here. I even brought back to bags in my luggage so I won't have to be without it! But remember, the water is what makes a great cup of coffee. Enjoy!"
5,Greenlee drill bit with screw point bit,"bit works great. Just note, if you want to run JR-45 cable, you may want to get 3/4"" instead. This bit is a bit small for that. My fault."
1,Flimsy and dull,These are no better than the ancient ones I was replacing. Flimsy and dull. I don't expect them to last the year.
3,Great CDs----Bad Packaging!!!!,"I received your product today and for the second time I was very disappointed on how it was packaged. The case for the CDs is cheaply made. The little plastic pins that are suppose to hold the CDs in place have come through broken again for the second time. My first order was sent back to the seller and fortunately I had no problem with getting my money back. I did not expect to get my second order in the same condition. The disks were sliding all over the place and you have to be very careful when you close the case.I had purchased the first season of Third Watch and the way it was packaged was so much better and really protected the CDs. I hope you take this in consideration when the 3rd season is released.Finally if you could send me another case like the one used for the First Season that better protects my investment, I would greatly appreciate it."
4,Third Watch,Love this show. There is a bit of awkwardness in viewing in the parts where a commercial once had a spot. I do not mind it though as I hate commercials. Only wish that it either ran directors cut or edited scenes in place of the pauses.
4,One of the best in the past,I just purchased the 1st season. I enjoyed it as much as I did when it was aired on tv. I will now purchase the 2nd season.
5,Someone Light a Fire Under the DVD Producers!,What is it going to take to get the other 5 seasons of the best cop/fire/medic drama ever to air on tv on DVD? There is so much garbage available on DVD why not this series? Please get a move on. If you make them available we will buy them. I promise! =)
5,Third Watch- 2nd Season,"We waited a very long time for this season to come out, and it was totally worth it. This was an excellent show. The 2nd season is great; before it turns into a police drama(which was also great but I enjoyed the firefighter angle) it gave us several great episodes. I'm saving the bulk of them for winter, when I can't go out and do stuff.I hope it doesn't take as long to come out wih the other seasons, and they'd better come out with them. There's a loyal fanbase out here."
5,Good news is an understatement.,"Overjoyed. That's how I can describe my reaction to this news. To the higher ups, the responsible parties, thank you. Thank you very much. To my fellow Third Watch fans, get your money ready. This comes as a big relief because I can now free up a whole lot of space on my DVR and do not have to buy tapes to record the episodes on two. I already have season 4 on tape. So, here in America, we speak money. So, when this series comes out, let's clear the shelves. I know that there are a whole lot of fans out there. I'm sure that we can put some money in their pockets. Sort of a thank you for the dvds. To my fellow fans, see you in line. To Warner, know this, and I'm sure I speak for quite a few here, you have my season 2 money. You have my season 3 money. You have my money for every season that you put out. Recession be damned, I will be buying it."
5,Third Watch Season 2,Simply the best Emergency Service's TV drama ever made ! Still fantastic after watching it several times - I just wish they would get season's 3 - 6 out on DVD as soon as possible.
5,Amazing show!,"It is beyond my understanding why every show even the pathetic ones end up on dvd yet Third Watch has not been given the same honour of full season dvd releases! Hurry up and release the entire show! Acting superb, script fantastic. Characters on the show are engaging and each character reminds you of either someone you know or yourself! Best show ever to air on TV."
5,Third Watch,"Thank goodness we will finally get to see Season 2 of one of the best shows ever. I pre-ordered it as soon as I was able to. Let's hope that Season 3 and 4, etc. will not take so long. We have been watching one episode per week just to make Season 1 last longer. Why they ever took this show off the air is beyond me."
4,Third Watch,Bought this for my mom and son who loved it during first run. Mom is sick and my son is now 19 yr old. It's great to watch with them years later. Bought season one in a rush at Best Buy - twice the price I got season two for on Amazon. Came in time for Christmas and it was a big hit. Amazon informed me when the price went down (I had searched it) and I snatched it up.
3,"""WE NEED SOMETHING STRONGER""","This book is essential reading for anyone who loves Motown, soul music, popular music, or anyone who is or wants to be involved in the music business. Harold Kieth Taylor gives an ""op-ed"" view and discusses the strengths and virtues of the hit factory that became famous for being ""The Sound of Young America."" Mr. Taylor incessantly sings the praises of Berry Gordy Jr. for his stringent quality control to the point of brown-nosing so much, that the reader might be inclined to think that they were intimately involved with each other! Quality control is what this book lacks: countless typographical errors, numerous errors in punctuation and grammar, varying shades of print ink, and referring to Atlantic Record's Ertegun brothers as the Ahmet brothers. The reader has to wonder if any editing or proof-reading was done. Berry Gordy Jr. would never ever have allowed anything so sloppy to be graced with the Motown name. [...]"
3,Like sitting through a business school guest lecture,I found myself disappointed by the book. It's written by a former Motown engineer but instead of focusing on the details of the recording studio and getting the Motown sound he focuses on how amazing he thinks Gordy is and constantly compares Motown to Stax. In the final 2-3 page chapter of the book he does go into details of mics and mixing (Which earned it an extra star). A little more mixing room play-by-play and a little less music business school guest lecturer please!
1,Could have been so much better...,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of my copy but I shouldn't have been so enthusiastic. I love reading about/talking to people that were really there at the heart of the phenominon but this guy has written this book like a very bad school essay! In places it's very dissjointed - there are several spelling mistakes (why didn't he spell check it before sending it to the publisher?). A couple of the things are so badly written I think Stevie Wonder did the typing! Really, don't bother. I hate to give a bad review but it is what it is."
2,take a pass ...,I found it a waste of money ... talk about 'filler' ... I found he stretches everything out to make this book as long as he can. If you boiled it down to what was useful and interesting it would have been one chapter. He certainly needed an editor ... or at least SOMEONE to read it through before being printed. Not sure why he kept downing Stax so much. It's not like they were a total flop !! As a true Motown lover I was disappointed in this one and it won't be getting a reread ....
2,Very short...very little information,"I should have read the fine print on this Amazon offering. It is an excerpt; not an article. In fact, it is only a few pages long and has very little actual information. I'm sure the entire article is interesting, but this isn't it."
4,magnaflo exhaust/front half with cats,"This is a bolt in product but does require some welding if you want a real nice job. The fit is very tight around the oil pan, almost too tight. End result is a very nice front half of the exhaust system."
5,The best show on television,"This DVD contains season 1 of what I feel is by far the best show on television. The terrific writing is matched only by the acting skills and deadpan jokes of the cast. The amount of characters and the time the show has spent to develop each one lends to a story that has many different things going on at once. Seinfeld was able to do this as well, but did not have as many characters and the humor was more out in the open; Arrested Development seems to not care if the viewer gets every joke, as long as it makes itself laugh.This DVD is perfect, because the show can be watched over and over again and still be funny. Having watched it twice, I find myself still catching jokes I didn't the first time through during the season last year. Treat yourself and get this box set."
5,Arrested Development is hilarious.,This is a must see for anyone who realizes that his or her own family is dysfunctional. Every character is a gem.
5,"""Arrested"" How I Love You (It's A Lot)","I fell in love with this show during the first episode. It is truly the funniest show on TV. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster before I bought it, and spent maybe five or six hours straight watching it. It's hilarious. You can't pick out a favorite character because they're all equally funny. Buy the DVD. WAtch it over and over. Tell your friends to buy it and watch it. Watch the new episodes on TV."
5,This is the funniest television show in the history of the world,"Seriously. Buy it, watch it, and love it. Then tell all your friends, if for some crazy reason any of them haven't already bought, watched, and loved it.Then write angry letters to Fox about treating their quality programs as they deserve."
2,I thought it was a waste of time to watch.,Pretty boring. It is a disappointing. Maybe I need to try watching it again another time but it might be a waste of time.
4,Another great episode,"As expected, another great episode. Buster is the key to this episode. I usually find Buster annoying, but this episode works really well."
1,Yawn-a-Thon,"I read the reviews here, heard the hype elsewhere and decided to finally give this show a shot. What an incredible waste of time. This show is not funny, it's not even dry humor. It is stale, depressed, boring writing being conveyed by mostly listless tortured acting. Think of Grapes of Wrath minus the cheer and color. I believe this is the fault of the director ringing any life out of what should be good performances by a talented ensemble (not that anyone could do much with this poor script). Were the screen writers on strike again at this time??? And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, in walked Fonzie - yep Henry Winkler, and it got worse. The pinnacle of his career was The Fonz (which was dreadful) and it has all been downhill for him since Happy Days. No wonder it's on the free list, they should really pay us to watch this one."
2,This is the best sitcom on tv? That's depressing.,"If this is what people consider entertaining, it's no wonder the country is going to hell. I gave up on sit-coms 20 years ago, and I sure as heck didn't see anything on this show to make me reconsider. How pathitic is the collective American sense of humor if this is what we think is funny? Stop watching this crap and read a book or something!"
1,Arrested Development,"Arrested Development, I am under pressure to give it a star - what a load of crap. This is the greatest piece of dung to come out of the USA since George Bush said that IRAQ had WMD. What is wrong with your reviewers are you all in the glad hand of that other moron Rupert Murdoch? Please some objectivity."
1,"ARREST THE PRODUCERS, THIS IS TRULY A DUMB SHOW","Talk about how to waste a half hour timeslot. This show sucks.Obnoxious, draggy and just, DUMNB! I am a lover of great comedy, Scrubs, Everybody Loves Raymond, That 70's show, and many other classics no longer on tv. To call this one of tv's best comedies is just wrong. Nothing funny here.P.S.Where is the 0 stars option? This show has done a good job to deserve it."
5,Probably one of the best comedies I've ever seen,This humor is very subtle at some parts and extremely laugh out loud at others. I'd say it was the best non-animated comedy I have ever seen. (Only better comedy is Family Guy)
5,Addictingly Funny,"I bought these DVD's for my brother on a reccomendation from a friend without ever having seen the show myself. My entire family love the show and since then I and most of my close friends have become somewhat addicted. The plot outlines are brilliant, the character's hilarious, and the narration is really funny. I haven't met a person who did not like this show after seeing a few episodes... in fact everyone I know who has seen it loves it! I would reccomend buying both season 1 and 2. It is money well spent!"
4,Great series,Keeps you entertained throughout. You don't know what is going to come out from scene to scene. Characters are entertaining.
4,Pretty good entertainment,"I really enjoied this when I saw it on TV, but I couldn't commit to it weekly. Having it on DVD is nice. Unfortunately When I recieved it from Amazon.com, box that the set of DVDs came in was bruised on all corners, and underneath the shrink-wrap there was some gummy black tar like substance. Overall I have been fairly impressed with Amazon.com's customer service, but I was a bit suprised to recieve my order in such shabby condition. Not the norm for Amazon.com."
5,One of the best series ever,"I have come to realize that if I like a series it is often doomed to failure. I am a snob. I tend to look for intelligent and sardonic wit in televised comedies. Sadly, only I and about 20% of the populace looks for the same. The rest of my beloved citizens prefer boob and butt jokes, telegraphed jokes, and sophomoric humor. If you are an erudite snob such as myself you will love ""Arrested Development."" If you are a member of the inglorious troglodytes which network TV caters to you will most-likely not enjoy this show."
5,Great Show,Love this show....has me laughing every time! I also love how I can watch it anytime I want using Amazon's instant video streaming.
2,Its okay,"Some times I just don't think I see the humor in some things or people that others do. I love Fraiser, Cheers,and the Sarcasm of House. But my wife and I watched the Pilot of this and did not laugh once. Some one please tell me it getsbetter."
5,Everyone Else's Review Is Wrong,"I, like you, just read the reviews for AD. Most of them were to the tune of ""Funniest Show Ever"" or ""Why Can't I Give This 6 Stars?"" and that sort of thing. Let me tell you, they're wrong.Okay, maybe not wrong, but their descriptions of the show understate its complete perfection. I cannot think of a single thing, past or present, that mankind can be more proud of than Arrested Development. Seriously. If I had to choose between getting immunized or watching this show, I'd risk Polio. If Bin Laden had stolen the last copy, I'd go spelunking to retrieve it. Arrested Development is truly man's crowning achievement (move over, pyramids).If you don't believe me, then you haven't seen the show."
5,Comedic brilliance!,"Fox finally gets it right for the first time in years and renews a show that deserves all the support it can get. This show can be considered an acquired taste initially, but one could say the same for other classic shows such as Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The pacing and narrative are different from what is typically served up on TV, so it may take some time to adjust to the quirkiness of the show...let it sneak up on you as the episodes progress, and you will be genuinely surprised at how clever and laugh-out-loud funny this show truly is. I just wish Jason Bateman had made the cut for a Best Comedic Actor Emmy, as his work is surprisingly excellent and crucial towards grounding the rest of the loopy family members (all of them great as well) in something resembling reality, unlike the Jack & Karen slapstick nonsense in Will & Grace. Great stuff!"
5,Laughs for people smart enough to not have to be told when to laugh,This show is pure genius. It's laugh-out-loud funny from the first episode to the last.
4,One of the most humorous series of 2005,"For most people, ""ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"" is the best show they're not watching. Every character is original and humourous, each establishing a unique identity and style. This show is capable of making you laugh out loud when you're home alone. The show is reminiscent of Seinfeld, with characters causing each other problems due to Seinfeld-ian misunderstandings. The show has a great heart, as family is a central theme, and source of comedy, of the series.This show has a firm commitment to consistency. The show presents subtle jokes that only a devoted viewer will comprehend. For this reason, the show has fantastic replay value, as you can watch episodes repeatedly and continously find new layers of humour that you may have missed."
5,Let's teach them a lesson....,"This is the best TV show I have seen in years. The cast is excellent and they work very well together. I was sick and tired of all of the reality shows that have been on recently and had to find something else before I went crazy. This show has me laughing every episode. This show has many subtle jokes so if you just don't ""get it"", then don't purchase the DVD. I'm sure everyone who watches this DVD will love it. I can't wait until October for season 2."
5,Best show on television,"For those of you who have not seen this show yet, please trust me on this.....This is probably the best comedy on television since Seinfeld & I'm starting to think that this show is actually better than Seinfeld.The ratings have not been great, because not many people have caught on yet. But there is a reason that this show is winning so many awards.Please give it a chance & see for yourself. This Season 1 DVD set will PROVE to you that this is hilarious show. The only regret you will have is that you didn't catch on sooner!"
5,UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY,"You get so much more from this series by watching it on DVD. It is fantastic, and unbelievably funny."
5,the best cast,"This is the greatest dvd ever - it's a great pick me up whenever you're down. I love the writing and the cast is right on - I think everyone should have been nominated for an emmy - Michael Jr. is such a great deadpan nerd! I watched ""the Office"" with Steve Carell (who I loved on the daily show), so I thought I would love it as much as this - I hated it - the only good character was Steve Carell, so it sucked - the difference with AD is that everyone is so unique and so funny and brings their own quirkiness to the characters. And of course Jason Bateman is the best calm rational guy in the midst of a totally crazy family. The guest characters are great too - Henry Winkler, Martin Short, Mo Collins, Liza Minelli (who knew?), Carl Weathers etc. LOVE IT"
5,This show requires quick wit to enjoy,"In my opinion, Arrested Development is the best TV show of all time (as of 2012. Don't hold it against me if something great appears in 2013+).However, I do know people who don't enjoy it. It requires a lot of attention and quick wit and memory and knowledge of pop culture to enjoy fully, and without these you may find it the show unremarkable."
5,10 STARS!,"Forget the 5 star option! This is the best comedy that I've watched in a VERY long time! The charecters remind me of my family, only in a very refreshing manner. The back-handed, dry-as-a-martini humor is not for the faint of heart. This show is wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone. I'd watch it specifically for Buster's charecter. (He's quite the nut!) LOVE THE SHOW!"
5,Find the hidden special Feature!,"It's not easy, and I can never seem to get to it when I'm wanting to show one of my friends (I think it's extended scenes on disk 2 but not sure), but look for the menu screen where Tobias is sitting at a desk across from Michael. If you fumble around with the dvd control you can get the cursor to move from the menu over to Tobias' cutoffs. Tap the ""enter"" button."
5,I would say best show on TV ever.,The other reviewers said it all. The writing is genius and the characters are endearing. Not to mention that the show breaks the hunky dory mold by actually following a narrative time line which is VERY rare in network TV. We are all so over exposed to sitcoms where at the end of the day everything is the same. Well not so with Arrested Development.In this show it goes from beginning to end and each episode is as funny as the last.HIGHLY recommend!.
3,Just another sit com,"This series is somewhat entertaining. Characters are not believable, script does not have deep premise; the show is boring is after the first couple of shows."
5,And the networks shall kill it.....,"Jeffrey Tambor....GENIUS. Ron Howard.....a little strange looking, but also a GENIUS. The entire cast of this show+the+writers+ballsy directing lead this into a realm of oddity not seen on a network show. Familiar plot ideas twisted into outlandish and wonderfully funny episodes. Not to mention our old buddy Jason Bateman. Who would've thought that THIS guy could be so edgy. This is a smart comedy about,uh, dumb people. If you enjoy shows that unfold like a reality show, but are in no other way a reality show...but.....MAN this show is hard to explain.... O.K., Just buy this DVD now! You won't be sorry. Please, show the network that this show deserves to stay on the airwaves!"
5,Hilarious & Out of control,"This show is great, good story line, out of control family, this show is a riot! Very entertaining and lovable characters!"
5,Genius,"I've been a fan of the show since the pilot and I've never written an amazon review, but this program and the dvd collection are both so fantastic that I feel it's my duty to spread the word. I would have paid 50 bucks for my 1st season dvd set because I watch at least 3 or 4 episodes a day. It's most definately the best dvd investment I've ever made. Buy it, you will not regret it."
3,Enjoying the series,"This is an interesting take on what is suppose to be an unusual family situation.....unfortunately, I would assume it shares a bit more of a typical family situation than most of us would like to admit(smile)."
1,Not as advertised,"I really havent watched this too much . I hear its good. But whats upsetting is I signed up for Amazon Prime under the impression that I got free streaming and was charged 17.99 for the first season?? I don't think thats free. Really used to be happy with Amazon but also recently ordered item for .98 cents that was supposed to be free shipping when I bought another item, which I did and was charged 5.00 postage. Not happy. Will probably cancel order for Amazon Prime which I can do on 23rd. Not worth it."
1,Overrated,"This show is boring, stupid and definitely not funny. It was a complete a waste of time. It is completely overrated and I am not sure what all the fuss is about."
2,Strained attempt at humor,"This series is beloved by many but I find it to be strained and wooden. The characters are over the top, one dimensional ""types"" rather than recognizable real people. The family members are cartoonish and this prevents them from being truly funny. Well intentioned but forced."
5,The Best Show I have Ever Seen,"It is my favorite my show, it is one of the funniest shows I ever seen, and I have never finished wacthing an episode and thought: ""Ehh, that was alright..."". Each and every episode is a Mona Lisa of Comedic art. The Allstar cast drives the show and the superb writing for the show makes it a can't miss. If you have a good sense of humor you will enjoy this. I would put more into this review but it really is that simple."
5,Best Deal Ever,"Let me put it this way, I have bought soooo much sh-- off Amazon and I have never thought twice about writing a review. But this was the most lovely purchase I ever made. I had heard a lot about this show, so I endulged and bought the whole set and it was endless hours of entertainment and happiness. Only now do I realize the impetus to keep this show going. It's brilliant!"
5,The Greatest Television Show Ever by Danny J. Henry,"This t.v. show was a coming of age, piss-your-pants-funny spectacle that pushed every limit and left me completly in a transe a hysteria because of this show's utter brilliance. If you do not buy this, it will be the stupidest mistake ever made, but not the stupidest mistake ever. The stupidest mistake ever was cancelling this extravagant show. I, Dan Henry, am speaking for America whwn I say this is the greatest television show ever and you'd be insane not to buy it."
5,Best comedy on TV since Seinfeld,"Not enough people watch this show, but it is the best comedy on TV now. I bought the DVD several months ago and am still watching it almost every day because it doesn't get old. Every character adds something funny to the show. The more you watch it the funnier it gets because there are jokes that are in reference to other episodes, they are sort of inside jokes. This is an intelligent comedy which is rare on TV now, I highly reccomend it."
5,One of the funniest shows on television,"I didn't get into Arrested development until half way through the first season, but once I saw that first episode I couldn't understand why I hadn't been watching this show. At times I find myself laughing out loud and can't seem to stop. The cast for this show is excellent and they work very well together. From the son who is secretly in love with his cousin to the son-in law who is a ""never nude"" and refuses to shower without a pair of cutoffs, this show is nonstop funny. And at the head of this clan is Jason Bateman as the son trying to keep the nuts in the asylum from completely getting out of hand. It is rare to find a show like this on the air and unfortunately Arrested Development is constantly fighting for it's life to stay on the schdeule. If not for the fans this may not have had a Season 2 or 3. But as long as we keep tuning in and buying the DVDs, we can keep this great show on the air and tickling our funnybones."
4,Arrested Development,Funny show! Enjoyed being able to watch it on streaming. Hopefully the rest of the seasons will become available as well.
2,Lame,"Juvenile writing, 3rd grade version of Weeds. Belongs on CBS on Monday nights. Nudity wouldn't help this turkey. Want to see funny, watch Archer."
5,Don't let it happen again to Community!,"Yes this may be the funniest show I've ever seen, but no one watched the freaking thing when it was on the air and it got cancelled. Maybe Fox didn't market it well enough, but it was a very intelligent show and maybe the viewing public couldn't handle that. Community is just as funny in my book (and hey look, it's the Russos again) and needs help. So yes watch this, but watch Community now and keep it on the air."
2,I really don't see the allure,My opinion I guess is in the minority but I just don't get it. I tried to watch it and like it. I really did. The camera work is weird and the comedy is non exsistent to me. I did not laugh once and I think I am pretty easy to please.
4,Great concept but incomplete,"This book is a wonderful addition to a healthcare library, but it shouldn't be the only book in it. When my children were exposed to hand-foot-and-mouth disease, I found nothing to help in this book. On the other hand ""Baby and Child Care"" by James Dobson did address the issue."
2,Not practical,"I bought this hoping would help my daughter and my family, but was very disappointed when something really happens, I can't find a way to deal with it. Take a easy example, my daughter has this eczema and I tried to find a easy way to help her at home, but all I could find from the book are some very strange medicines that I've never heard of before. I guess maybe it's strictly for people who are familiar with homeopathy, but not for me definately!"
5,This is the BEST book I have ever read for my child.,"I have recommended this book to all of my friends! If you like to make informed decisions about your child's health, this is a book for you. I am very impressed with the variety and alternatives this book gives parents with regards to helping their child become healthier and stay healthy. This is book is a must for every family."
1,This book should come with a warning label,"This book recommends that one should feed his or her child NON-FAT milk for optimal health! As soon as I read that, it was on its way back. If the authors are so blatantly mistaken, I can't trust any of the other information it contains. I strongly recommend that you fellow parents out there give your children WHOLE milk products, unless you wish to stunt their neurological development. The brain is built with fat! I'm studying to become a registered dietitian, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.P.S. Look up the dangers of consuming homogenized milk. You'll thank me later."
