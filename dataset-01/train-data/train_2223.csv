Given by same person"
5,Worthy Reading,"I've only read a couple chapters thus far, but I really enjoy this book. I like that it helps ""Westerners"" get a glimpse of understanding the Bible from a ""Non-Western"" context. Something that not many Americans concern themselves with doing, but really interesting and enjoyable to read. I like that it has various writers from various countries."
3,a cute little book,"I read this a decade ago, but I remember it being a cute little book. This is a fictional account of what it would be like to have been Sappho's female lover. It's so interesting to think about this years later. ... Still, bisexual female readers may dislike this book because Sappho is portrayed as flighty compared to her all-lesbian lover. This book is kinda rough around the edges, like much 1970s early gay liberation texts. Still, this was cute and worth checking out."
4,Nice album...,"Prety solid cd. Some skippable tracks and that's about it. Overall, worth the money and highly listenable. Go pick it up if you didn't already.Top Tracks:You Gonna Love MeI Don't Like The Look Of ItGettin' 2 ItLock N LoadYou Gonna Love Me (Remix)myspace.com/getthebloodmoney"
4,DA BACKWUDZ move to the Front,"I waz sold on the first single, but now that finally got the cd i recommend it to all hip-hop fanz. 4 1/2 starz."
4,excellent debut album,"I have to admit that when I first heard of this group called ""The Backwudz,"" I thought that they were going to be one those countless one hit wonders of rap. As I listened to this album though, I found that they are very talented down south rappers. My favorite songs would have to be track 1,2,3,6,7,12. I highly reccommend this album to any fan of good music."
3,Better than I Expected,"When I picked up this album I expected another Lil Jon-esque ATL album. However, I was pleasently surprised. They can, if they become a bit less comercial, become like oodie Mobb/Outkast. Their best song is easily ""Feeling Lonely""."
2,Useful but outdated,This is a useful study tool/resource. However the technology and format are seriously outdated and obsolete. The limited technology in this program means that software mapping is confusing and horribly limited. I recommend looking for something newer/better than this product.
1,Another Rip-Off from Braun Media,"Let the buyer beware - this volume actually provide the fourth, fifth and sixth chapter of the 1937 ""Dick Tracy"" serial, and uses a pretty bad print, to boot. Anyone interested in viewing the serial should like elsewhere for a better product at a much cheaper price."
5,"""THE ONLY"" engineering look at the first airplane","I first became aware of this book while visiting the Kitty Hawk Memorial in North Carolina. There, a park service employee showed me his dog-eared copy of this precious book. Even then, it was out of print and unavailable in the memorial park's gift shop. I only had it in my hands for a few minutes, but the book contained many engineering drawings and aerodynamic data which I have not even seen at the AIR & SPACE museum in D.C. or at WRIGHT PATTERSON A.F.B. in the Airforce Museum there. I have looked for it since. A must have for any true aviation buff.Chris Rau"
3,A tale of two maps,"The Tahoe map coverage is a little disappointing as only major trails in the immediate vicinity of the lake are included. However, the Point Reyes map is fairly extensive and includes trails throughout the better part of southern Marin county. Trails have a difficulty rating and a highlighted trail demarcation that were helpful but not as straight forward to understand as they could be."
2,"A young girl gets a new dummy, but it is alive and nasty.","A young girl gets a new dummy after her brother wreckes her old one, but her new one is talking by itself and getting the girl into trouble. The dummy is making a mess of the girls life by calling family members names and by breaking house hold items. She trys to kill the dummy but it does not work. The dummy is being a menace through most of the book till the very end when the dummy from the firt book comes and kills the dummy from this book."
3,Sizing problems,"Solid construction, it looks great, but I wish I'd know more about the sizing... I ordered this for a full-size bed, but it's much more suited to a queen-size. The posts stick out from the mattress a good 3"" on each side of a full-size. If you get a little creative with a bed skirt it's not really a problem, but this particular headboard would be much better suited for a queen-size bed."
4,"Beautiful, elegant, and fragile","These are very nice glasses with an elegant design. They look like the photographs when backlit, but in normal lighting the blue is darker and not quite as noticeable in my opinion. The lip is very thin and very fragile. I just ordered a replacement for one that I broke. It had a hair line crack all the way around the lip. I had always gently hand washed the glasses and was very careful when handling. I still don't know how the lip got cracked. Perhaps they are just a tad too fragile."
4,Thick and sturdy,"This is a really thick, sturdy liner. Nice size. I actually bought it to use in our camper shower and it's a bit too thick and stiff for such a small space, even after I cut it to size. It would be nice for a shower stall though."
1,Poor Quality,I have bought higher quality items at a Dollar store and judging by the packaging and quality of this item it looks like that's where it came from.If I didn't need such a specific size I would return it.
2,thin and rips easily,This curtain is more like a painting drop cloth. It's super thin plastic and does not have metal grommets to keep the holes from ripping.
4,Nice Story,I enjoyed this book very much and finished it quickly. I look forward to reading more about the Chance brothers.
4,Obscure history.,A nice history of these obscure and unique aircraft that were on the cutting edge of development during World War II. The goal was to have a high performance fighter that could be produced and operated in war-time conditions (for instance coal power for the engines). The book has some more photos and info than I have found on the internet about these aircraft. An interesting read and I am happy have it in my library.
5,A GIFT OF A BOOK,"In a voice that is original, powerful and wise, Linzi Glass has written a gorgeous, cannot-put-it-down book about the human cost of Apartheid. Its characters, especially the young protagonist Emily Iris, are immediately accessible and we simply want to follow them into their world, painful and deeply beautiful as it is. The only consolation in reaching the last page was that I could put the book into the waiting hands of my teenage daughter to be thoroughly enjoyed again."
4,Combines murder and political intrique,"The description of a Democratic party gala is described with the intimacy of one who has actually attended such an affair. It is for this reason that the reader trusts the author in the other relevant portions of the plotting and structure of this well-told tale of mayhem in our nation's capital. This is a fine addition to the author's stunning series of mystery novels using the backdrop of the great institutions of Washington, D. C."
1,"A sappy, unoriginal murder mystery",I was bored to tears by this book. A lack of creativity and poor writing make this a book I would recommend you miss!
3,Mediocre but readable,"I had found Margaret Truman's other books plodding in both narrative and dialogue; but this one, starring the ""Mac and Annie"" romantic detecting team, was pretty readable, and I will seek out others featuring these characters.This book was published in 1989; and I have to say that it was initially disconcerting, reading a book in which cell-phones & the Internet had yet to be invented -- and Sammy Davis, Jr and the Soviet Union are both still alive."
3,I actually kinda liked this one.,"Yeah, I still have the same old gripes about Truman's overall writing style (or lack thereof), but they've lessened in intensity now that she's found in Mac Smith a decent sleuth. Too bad I know it won't last. (See my review for Murder in the Pentagon.)"
2,The Last Gasp of a Once Great Band,"For lovers of Horselips, this release was to put it bluntly - pathetic. After years of mixing tradtional Irish music with rock, the band gradually moved to a more pop/hard rock oriented sound with culminated in Short Stories. The band tries hard to sound almost punk, but falls short in almost every way. There is nothing original at all on this release, only tired repetitive guitar riffs, no violin or flute or any of the things that made Horselips so interesting. Try Dancehall Sweethearts, The Tain or Celtic Symphony for a taste of the real Horselips, or give Aliens a spin if you prefer a slightly harder sound. Steer clear of this one."
5,One of Horslips' Best,"This is vintage Horslips. Guests of the Nation is truly a fun track...their tribute to Ireland's tax-exempt status for artists. Unapproved Road and Soap Opera rock hard. Back in My Arms is one of their best ballads. Ricochet Man sounds almost like 50's do-wap. Summer's Most Wanted Girl showcases their musical diversity. There are no celtic instrumental tracks, but everything else you like about Horslips is on this album in a tour de force. Bonus! The CD includes 6 more tracks: songs from the album performed live in Roosky Ireland in March, 1980."
1,a travesty - 3 tracks & 7 `fillers` !!,"If it was 1-10 `stars`, I`d give this one 3 out of 10, as there are only three respectable tracks out of the ten on the album, i.e., Guests of the Nation, The Life You Save, Rescue Me. The rest of the album is, to use another reviewer`s adjective- [bad]! It`s mind bogglingly incredible that the same band who created albums like The Tain, Book of Invasions, Aliens etc....is responsible for this calamity. It`s not only an insult to Horslips fans but to music lovers in general."
2,a departure,"Horslips were an excellent folk/rock fusion band, who started in a very traditional vein, then began to integrate rock more and more, and doing it quite successfully (culminating in the brilliant ""Aliens"" album). The ""Short Stories"" album, to me, seems to throw away their folk heritage in an effort to be current (pop/new wave??) and it really doesn't do them justice. It's the least ""Horslips"", and their least interesting. (though I love ""The Life You Save"") Go for ""Book of Invasions"", ""Unfortunate Cup of Tea"" ""Aliens"" or any of their other discs first."
5,Buried Treasure / Irish Punks,"Who were Horslips? An Irish Band still demanding discovery by the verve & bounce of their music. Where were We, collectively, when this band was creating tunes during the lates sixties, through the seventies, just barely into the 1980's. HORSLIPS had a measure of fame in The UK, a small but faithfull following in America, now when one rediscovers the joy in their music: Wow. Short Stories/ Tall Tales opens strong with 'Guest of the Nation' swiftly yet subtly changing temple & mood from the bouyant defiance of 'Richochet Man' through the playful romp of 'Summer's Most Wanted Girl.' When you are in the mood for Irish rock, when you wish to take a Gaelic spin through the 1970's, drop this CD into the mix."
5,"Good Actors, Good Pilot.",The Show's Pilot originally aired back in 1996 showing promise. For anyone that had a remote interest in Horror/Scifi shows this show had them from the beginning. The cast itself worked well with each other and gave some great performances considering most of the action seens required them to visualize most of the things they were fighting. The only down side to this pilot is the demise of one of the characters which leads to the introduction of another with her young daughter. If this was a stand alone movie it wouldn't be so bad...watch the season as it unfolds and the ones that come after it and you'll know she should have been the one to go.
5,Demons Beware,"I love this show! I adore its ideals and its wonderful way of showing how the evils of the world are combated. Oh, how I miss Philip. I wish that Patrick Fitzgerald had never left! But I love the show anyway. I just wish that I didn't have to stay up until 12:30 on a Sunday night to see it!"
1,Complete Rubbish,Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. No link whatsoever to the Poltergeist films as it was billed. A very fake looking Ireland and no real horror content. After about half an hour I knew that I had hired a complete dud. The type of film where you watch to the end in the vain hope that it will somehow improve and then you get very annoyed when it doesn't. If only the demons had won!
3,first REaL horror film,"i really wanted to see a horror film that actually looked good besides attack of the killer tomatoes (yuck). So i rented this with my two old friends (icky mon and erin) and it was boring. first, erin wouldnt shut up and monica kept thinking she knew so much about it. i really didnt get the story cuz it was kinda boring. Well it had this box........"
1,oxy e,bought it after reading about helping cancer patients. cant really review it since the patient did pass on so cant say it helped
4,interesting,Very interesting. i enjoyed it very much. I do feel that many things and lessons monroe went through are specific to him or were presented to him in a certian way because of his perceptions (like the female/male stuff he learns). Seems sexist but coudl just be a product of the time he grew up in. not bad at all
4,A Magical Journey,"Whether you believe in out-of-body travel or not, this book will provide you with some whimsical and thought provoking insights as to how the ""other side"" is organized and what happens when we die. Furthermore, Monroe has independently corroborated via controlled out-of-body travel what has been consistently reported by mystics and those who have had near death experiences. The only difference is the Monroe has been able to take the study of this subject matter to a level of depth that has never been reached before. A must read!!"
2,Book is ok,"No problem with the quality or appearance of the book. Just not too impressed with the contents. It shows what it's like to travel outside the body without a spiritual master and no real knowledge of what soul and the other worlds are. Because of that it's a jumble of made-up terms, speculation and disjointed descriptions of experiences that have no spiritual value to me, and I can't imagine to anyone other than the author. If you know anything about soul travel, don't bother reading this book. It's boring."
2,Poor editing,"This book is in desperate need of a careful editor. I greatly enjoyed 'Journeys Out Of The Body' but had to put this one down after a few chapters. I got to a point where you're presented with a dictionary of terms for the next part of the book, terms that have no relevance outside of the Monroe institute. Instead of presenting me with a dictionary, why not just rewrite the section in terminology everyone can understand? Reading should be a joy, not a chore."
5,FAR OUT AND YET MAYBE TRUE,"Monroe is Robert Monroe of the Monroe Institute and I take this book to be an honest account of what Mr Monroe thinks he saw or experienced. It is like a travel book in which we hear of what was seen and what was intuited (since communication is non-verbal). I believe it is a brave attempt to communicate such stuff. The book should rank amongst the must-reads of any serious student of out of body experiences and related areas. My concerns are about setting the observations into some critical and/or scientific and/or analytical context. A summary of the implied worldview (as found at the back of Sugrues ""There is a River"") would have been appreciated."
4,Classic and well-written obstetric text,"This is a textbook that should be owned by everyone in the obstetrics field. It is well written and concise(ish), covers virtually every topic, and even has a little humor. Cons: It does not go into extreme detail on most topics. This is understandable given it's more of an ""overview-type"" text. If you want more detail, buy a book just on that topic."
4,these guys rock!,"I love their music. Then again, I danced in one of their music videos (Heart that Remains) about 6 months before my 50th birthday. LA Lindsay is my favorite track. Nick has an amazing voice. This CD was made when they were still a quartet."
4,This band should be hitting it big any time now!,"I am very impressed with this album! I stumbled across the Y-O-U website (www.pleaserock.com) by chance and was hooked as soon as I heard ""LA Lindsay"". This group has a very catchy and enjoyable sound. Normally this style of music doesn't appeal to me; my favorite band is Dream Theater, obviously a bit different in genres. But these guys have really got something good going. I hope word will get out about this CD. I would have to say the best songs are ""Movie Kiss"" and ""LA Lindsay"". I highly recommend this album to anyone reading this review. Like I said, I don't listen to this stuff normally but these guys just flat out rock! I will admit there are a few songs that I don't particularly care for, that's why I'm giving it a four. But still, buy this album!"
3,Strategic Management Concepts 12th ed,There were unpleasant things written by the previous owner in the book on quite a few pages.
4,Great Service,Sharp GOTH STAR OF DAVID Silver Tone Pewter PENDANT NecklaceWhat a find looks real good.My Grandson loves it. And had alot of his friends asking where he got it.I was told its the in thing for teens.I got quick service and was so glad to shop on line.Its just the right lenth but what I liked about it is that it can be adjusted.
5,PERFECT!,"This is the most admirable, respected, and honorable necklace I have ever worn. I am so proud to be a Jew, and I want others to know that fact too."
2,very cheap,"I would not reccomend this to hang around your neck, My son hangs it on his rear view mirror and it looks like that."
4,Great Practice at home when you can't get to the course,Good Video to get you started. Good Exercise routine detailed in the video. Only reason I did not give 5 Stars is that I felt there could have been more Drills and Specifics in the Video. I would recommend purchasing to a friend.
2,My puppy won't go on it!,"Our 4 month old puppy is paper trained. So when we got the Wizdog 2 weeks ago we put the puppy pad on the blue box, without the grid just so he can get used to the base. No we started adding the grid and he refuses to go on it and ends up peeing on the floor next to it! I don't know if it's the smell of the plastic or what, but it's not working well."
2,Wizdog Indoor Dog Potty,"This was a total waste of money. My pomeranian was very uncomforable with the grating because she has small paws. Newspapers don't fit into the plastic container if I want to use it w/o the grates which, of course, defeats the entire purpose. It was $50 thrown away."
2,Color was off!,"Unfortunately, we received 3 chairs, and they were all different shades of pink. The chair is functional, but I would advise people not to order a specific color on-line, the pink is not a hot pink...."
2,Not in love with this stool!,"I've ordered a different brand here before and been happy with the stools - this is slightly cheaper but you def get what you pay for. Cute, shiny, nice color. One tip over (I have kids) on a vinyl floor and the top cracked completely. You can just tell by the feel of it and even the flimsy nature of the footstand, it's just not sturdy. What a shame."
5,Leisa does it again!,"another great title from Leisa...everything she does seems to be of high quality,especially the ones from the ""Sexy"" series. my wife buys just about every fitness dvd she can find. and she was raving about this one in particular. she's been using it religiously and it's working. not that it matters, but the dvd artwork is nice as well. it's good to see such a high quality product in all areas."
2,Don't waste your money,I purchased the in-ear headphones thinking that the bass would be better. Its not. Actually after using them for a day I returned them. The in-ear headphones that came with the iPod actually has better sound quality.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES,I love my ipod. I'm a long time and loyal mac user and usually rave about my apple products. These in ear headphones were comfortable but the sound was weak and thin. The headphones that ship with the ipod (not great but not bad) sound much better. I returned these headphones the next day. I really felt that they were a waste of money. I'm surprised at apple for passing them off as superior. Don't waste your money. If you want really good sound spend a little more money and get good headphones. The apple in ear headphones are terrible.
2,Not for working out,"I have been using these for several months. I am constantly having to deal with them popping out of my ears. I don't think the sound quality is all that great, either. Overall, I am just not happy with them."
3,Not as good as the original,I know about the fit issues but I really got them to fit pretty well. It is really the sound quality that is lacking. I think there were some issues around the level that the originals could be played at that Apple worried about. Once again the lawyers win. We the non-idiot percentage of the population must suffer because the idiots can not use the volume control on their Ipod. It is a sad state of affairs.
2,Its a Waste,"Even though there are ways of putting them in correctly, it just isnt worth it. It takes too much time an effort just to put them in. Its especialy hard to put them in in a car. Even though they do have a better sound quality than ""best buds,"" its just to annoying to use. Even when I put them in corretly they tend to hurt my ears affter taking them off. All in all just get another pair of ""Best Buds"" if you need a good pair of headphones for your ipod. I would suggest using a regular pair of headphones, butits takes up to much power from the ipod.-Brian Artusio"
1,please reissue the original design,"What a waste of money. I've tried all three sizes of ear bud, and I cannot get them to stay in--I get them in 'properly' but they pop out if I move my head. While they are in the sound is tinny and inferior to the original ear buds. Too bad the old version is only available in cheap knockoff form."
1,Ear-DUD!,"Do not waste your money on these headphones. I bought a pair, and after only limited use, the left speaker died. I don't mourn the loss, as even with the smallest size bud, they didn't fit right.I was disappointed. Everything else I've ever bought from Apple was excellent. These, though, were a waste."
5,These phones are better than the crap that came with the Ipod.,"Ok, so after reading reviews I was somewhat leery of getting these, at over thirty bucks a pop. The Phones that came with the Ipod sucked, and broke. The wires came out of the plug thingy and I thing sparks came out at the phone part after dropping them into a bucket of water while washing the car. Which leads me to needing new phones. After putting the small ends on, they sound great! And fit my ears just fine thank you very much. Usually the in ear phones hurt the hell out of my ears, but these are ok. The sound isn't bad, I don't think its tinny or no base, but I don't listen to base infused music so, whatev. I would recommend people to get them only because they don't suck and are able to be customized."
3,Difficult to use,The sound is much better with these then the standard earbuds. But they are very difficult to use. If they were not so difficult to get them to stay in my ears I would give them a higher rating.
4,decent buds,"You can find these much cheaper now. My experience with these kind of buds is that fit is everything, and what sounds and fits well for one person will not for another. But these work fine for me. Sound quality comparable to buds that came with Ipod. Bass perhaps a little better and sound isolation much better because these fit into the ear canal. I also find these more comfortable.I don't know why so many people knock the audio quality of ipod buds. Really good buds cost more than the Ipod, so you should not expect miracles in this price range. You have to compare these to similarly priced buds, and I find Ipod buds by far the best in their price range. Much clearer and brighter than the competition."
2,poorly designed headphones,"I bought these thinking they would stay in my ears better than the old ones, and they are way worse. They are uncomfortable when I put them in my ears, they don't stay in place, and my ears were hurting after the 10 minutes I spent pulling my ear around to get them in like the Apple website suggests. They felt really weird when I finally did get them in, like I was walking around with my ears plugged. I tried all the sizes too...Maybe it's my ears, but I really really hate these, the old ones stayed in place much better. Plus they're $40!! For what??"
2,Not the right fit,"After reading some good and bad reviews I went ahead and bought them anyway. They will not stay in my ears, I tried the three different sized ear buds but non will do the job, very irritating.So, I do not recommend them at all, too bad because if they stay in when you sit really still the sound quality is really good.Aloha"
1,the WORST,"A. You have to shove them so far into your ears to get any bass at all.B. They fall out CONSTANTLY. Don't even think of using them while you exercise--once you start sweating, there's no keeping them in.These things drive me crazy!"
2,not that great,"i was not very happy with this product... the headphones do have a pretty decent sound, but they keep falling off, especially when you are running or something. Which makes it useless for all I care."
2,"Great sound, but lots of problems","I was unhappy with the standard iPod headphones, so I got these hoping for more comfort and better sound. I was quite pleased with the extremely clear sound, better bass, and great fit of these headphones...for 3 months. Then the volume in the left bud started reducing and going in and out. I sent them to Apple and got a new pair in 3 days. 5 months later, I am having the same problem, but with the right bud instead.While these have great sound and fit wonderfully, they are a hassle, and I do not suggest anyone buys them."
4,M9394G/A In-ear headphones,"After reading several negative reviews regarding these earphones, I have come to the conclusion that the purchasers that had negative comments did not take the time and insert the buds into the ear properly. I just received my Apple earphones today, took the medium buds, put them in my ear and pulled the top of the ear until they were seated and wow, awesome sound and comfort. The volume of my shuffle is at less than half up volume wise and they are staying in my ears. I'm happy with the purchase. The original earphones are fine, however they are not as comfortable and they tend to fall out easily. Also, there is a scraping sound when the earphone wire drags on your clothing, but this is due to the good ear seal and the noise-cancelling reason. I can live with that. Good buy!"
2,Still a work in progress,"I have no doubt that Apple will eventually get these right, but these in-ear headphones are just not ready for prime time. No matter how many variations of the different-sized rubber adapters I experimented with, the things would begin to work their way out of my ears from the instant I inserted them. In addition, the sound is less than memorable.After hours of frustration, I gave up and ordered ETYMOTIC RESEARCH ER-4P MicroPro earphones. At more than five times the price of the Apple counterparts, they are worth every cent -- they bring all the possibilities of the iPod to life."
3,Good but not good enough,first off i love the new concept of the internal earbuds that fit in your ear and through the earplugs prevent much external noise from preventing you from hearing your music. the headphones have desent bass and treble but i found that they were quite difficult to keep in my earsbecause the plugs are joined to the actual earbud (my ears are pretty small)these heaphones dont stay in all to well and it just becomes a nuisance to have to constantly press them back inI returned my pair and purchased the white pair of sony mdr-ex71s. they are really rare but offer even better sound quality and a much more comfortable fit because the earplugs are seperate from the driver unit. that said they are also quite a bit more expensive in store then the ipod ones :P
1,Bad fit no matter what I do!,"I purchased these ear buds thinking that it'll stay in my ears better than the earphones that came with my iPod when I was running. I was WRONG. From reading past user reviews, I tried all their tricks - pulled my scalp back when inserting them, changed out the different size rubber casings multiple times, etc. - and no matter what I did, the ear buds kept on falling out of my ears when I moved. When I sat still, they seemed to stay in place but the sound quality wasn't THAT much better than the regular earphones. Save your money!"
1,Didn't Stay in My Ear,Just terrible. They didn't stay in my ear and the sound was too tinny. I had to return them.
2,"earbuds never fit, no matter what","I've tried to get the earbuds to stay in, and no matter which technique I try, they never do. I've changed sizes, seating positions, etc., and they always pop out. If they're not fitted properly the sound is terrible--no bass at all. Once in, they sound great. But if I'm using them on the treadmill, they pop out in seconds--even after I've fitted them by pulling up on my ear."
2,Returned to Apple after 1/2 hour of use,"I bought these headphones expecting better sound quality and comfort compared to the earbud headphones that came with my iPod. After a 1/2 hour of use, I didn't find either to be the case. In fact, I preferred the sound of the original headphones over the newer ones which sounded flat. I tested this by switching headphones back and forth while listening to a variety of songs (classical, rock, etc.). As for the fit issue, it's possible that I didn't put them in the right way. But I did try on all three sizes and ultimately did not find any as comfortable as the originals. The one good thing about them is that they come in a neat case, so you can avoid the inevitable tangle of wires of the original iPod headphones. But the case alone does not justify the price tag. I ended up sending them back. I think Apple dropped the ball on this one."
1,Don't Buy!,If you small ears holes like i do this is not the product for you. I used the smallest rubber pieces it had and it would not stay in even though i was sitting still. So I cannot imagine if i was trying to run. This was a true waste of my hard earned money
5,Give these a chance! Learn how to insert them properly!,"Before buying these headphones, I read through many of the reviews here. The main complaints:1) Tinny sound2) They fall outThe end result of these complaints were usually returns and denounciations.Well, I say: Give these a chance! Read through the directions on how to insert them! They are *in-ear headphones*; the way that you put them on are obviously different from the way you put on regular earbuds.It certainly may take some getting used to, but once you get them fitting properly the sound is completely amazing!What I love about these headphones:1) Wonderful noise-cancelling ability. I can't hear a thing with music blasting in these.2) BASS! Wow, totally didn't know some of my songs could sound like this. Can't wait to use these to watch movies.3) Snug fit. After a while, I barely notice that they're there.4) Aesthetic appeal. These look great with your iPod.So please, don't be so quick to return these. Give them a shot! It'll be worth it!"
3,Don't Buy the Hype,"I don't know who the folks that gave these earphones 5 stars are working for but don't buy into the sales pitch (In fact, I hardly trust a review on Amazon anymore unless its negative). The sound is better than the earbuds in my opinion, but they do slip out if you wear them while in motion: even simple slow walking. I have jammed them into my ear as far as possible using the different size adapters, and they still work themselves out in short order. If you just want to listen to your ipod while sitting still, then they are good. Otherwise, stick to the earbuds or buy some earphones that clip directly to your ear."
3,Odd Ipod Earphones,"The sound of these is variable in quality, depending how far you push them into your ear. Shallow sounds tinny and deeper the sounds are more full and bassy. The Max volume was LOWER than my original phones on the Ipod (a plot to keep kids to get high volume sound / hearing damage ). You can turn up the Ipod bass on the EQ but its still not as good as before, the Odd shape ear pieces like to fall out while walking. They come with two extra ear piece cones (they look like chameleon eyes)"
1,Don't waste your money,I bought a pair of the earphones and am wildly disappointed - they sound like tin cans and they don't stay in my ears.
1,Not an easy or comfortable fit.,"I've pushed, pulled, twisted, lifted these buds and my ears and still a lousy fit. Changed everything - even tried Shures gels, but they do not fit the earpieces well.Skip these, I wish I had."
1,I was really hoping these would work.,"I received my iPod Earbuds today and was looking forward to having some earphones that would not only sounded great, but would also stay in my ears. Unfortunately, this was not the case. In fact, since I couldn't even get these things to stay in my ears I can't rate the overall sound quality.I tried all three earbud sizes and followed Stephen's instructions to the letter, but I was still unsuccessful. I must have tried for 20 minutes to make these work. Finally my ears just couldn't take it anymore and I gave up. Perhaps my ear canal is just not deep enough.Oh well, back to the drawing board."
2,Good sound if they stay in your ear!,"These in-ear headphones do produce good sound if they stay in your ears. I can get them to fit for a few minutes at a time. When they are in my ears, there are good highs and excellent bass delivery so I do like them for the sound quality, however, the downside is that they slip out of my ears when moving around. I find that when moving around I have to push one or both back in about every 3 minutes. As soon as they start to slip out of my ears the bass is lost and they are tinny. Pushing them back in place will recover the bass. Positioning is key to good sound reproduction with these. If you know that earbuds slip out of your ears easily, so will these. If you dont typically have problems with earbuds, these will probably stay in and you will love them. I am returning them, not for the sound quality but because I cant get them to stay in my ears."
2,"Great sound, won't stay put!","IF you can get the headphones to stay securely in your ear the sound is pretty phenomenal. Alas, I cannot get the d*mn things to stay securely seated in my ear canal. While they come with three different sized rubber nubs to fit your ear size, the rubber nubs are easily overcome by the weight of the wires and constantly fall out of position. Once out of position in your ear canal the sound quality diminishes greatly and the music is overwhelmed by bass-less treble (reminds me of AM radio). Unless you plan on remaining perfectly stationary while listening through your earphones keep shopping for more reliable headphones. And if you plan on listening at the gym you should forget about these headphones altogether!"
3,Nice but not for small ears,"I have small ears and have found that even the smallest of the 3 options don't fit me very well. Even following some of the excellent advice given on Amazon about how to place the ear pieces, I find that I don't get the noise reduction I expected. Nor are they a completely comfortable fit because they are too large. I do think that they would be good for someone with a larger ear canal. The sound is as one would expect from such small ear pieces, good treble, not so good bass."
2,"Good at first, then downhill fast","Maybe I'm excessively mean to my iPod in-ear headphones or maybe it's just how they're made, but these little buds have not lasted longer than 6 months. At first, I thought it was the songs, then I thought it was me (am I losing my hearing???), but today, I did the unthinkable, and I plugged in my 10 dollar headphones to find out -- it's the iPod buds.First the right bud seemed faint and dying. Then the left. Now it's both and no matter what I do (jam them in my ears, fiddle with the wires, turn the volume up and up and up), they aren't working anymore.When they do work, they're really great. They aren't as great as advertised (in my opinion), but they are nice little headphones. I only wish I had done some research first before spending so much money on them because my 10 dollar headphones will now be accompanying me and my iPod wherever I go.Word to the cautious -- they may die on you some day. They may not. But do you want to spend that much money to find out?"
1,dont waste your time or money on this,"these headphones are quite honestly not worth 40 dollars. they have a horrible bass response and the mid-bass gets all mixed together-these things are to be avoided, if possibleif you want a decent pair of ear-buds (not really in-ear, but close enough) with BETTER sound quality, then i would reccomend the sennheiser mx300/400/500 line (~15$)if you are really a big spender...then i would recommend the etymotic er-4s (~300$). these are audiophile quality plugs and cannot be beat (just make sure you get the low impedance versions for portable use-cant remember if its the er-4s or er-4p)of course, there are others in between these two price ranges, but these are the only two that i have any experience with."
1,dont like at all,"i dont even use them,, the right earbud doesnt fit in my ear even after trying all the sizes. i am very disappointed with them.. i am using the head phones that come with the ipod."
1,This Apple product is rotten to the core!,"Bought these and used them once. Had to remove them when I found myself in dire need of some Excedrin Migraine. What do you get for your $39? Cheap, tinny, bass-less sound that's like being plugged into a busted Walkman. The buds themselves don't remain stable in the ear, so forget about using them while engaging in motion-involved activity (such as jogging, walking, head-bobbing, neck movement, etc). These are by far the worst earbuds on the market. How could Apple stoop so low? Don't be fooled! Do a Google search for these and you'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product. You've been warned.I used to use Koss Earbuds, which were pretty good. I sold these iPod duds in favor of the XtremeMac In-Ear Headphones, which are the best ones available and worth the extra money."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THESE EARBUDS!!!!!,"I can't believe I paid $40 for these damn earbuds. Worst purchase I have ever made. Since the beginning the earbuds easily fall off your ear and diminish the sound quality when it does. You really have to push them inside your ear and the comfort is unbearable. The original headphones are much better and take it from me I know because I have tried alot of headphones out there and these by far have got to be the worst. I was really dissapointed when one of the earbuds suddenly died without any explanation. What makes me really mad is that I really don't use them that often. AGGHHH!!! If you are into sound quality try out the Bose Quiet Comfort Headsets. The sound is amazing and no other headphones come close to it. The name speaks for itself when it comes to comfort. I'll leave you with a last note...IF YOU WANT TO SAVE SOME MONEY, DON'T BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!!"
1,completely nonfunctional,"I am amazed that these are in production, they suck so bad. I did not realize that ""in ear headphones"" meant that you had to shove the ear piece into your ear as far as you can to get anything close to proper sound. The smallest buds were too large for my ears, so I would shove it in there (hardly seems like a good thing to do to your ears) and create a suction (even worse). I few minutes later, if I had managed not to touch the cord and release it from my ear, the suction would release and I had to start all over. I tried all of the suggestions I found on the internet (upside down, wrap the cord around your ear, turning the buds inside out). Nothing worked. These just suck. DO NOT BUY THEM. I will post a better option when I find one."
1,Complete Junk,These earbuds were the source of all my frustration while running. The only way these things might stay in your ears is if you glue or tape them in. I lost my mind with them for 3 days then got the Sennheiser MX70 earphones and have never been happier.
1,poor sound quality,"I just got the M9394G iPod earbuds as a gift, and I think the sound qualitly is awful. The two-year old earbuds that I got with my iPod originally sound better than this $40 pair. I originally thought I may have gotten a defective pair and returned them at the Apple store for a new pair but these too sounded like an old radio. Very tinny with no bass."
2,EARbuds?,"nah, these earphones dont fit in your ears too well. they have three sizes but they dont quite stay in your ear. also, if your the athletic type. there is no way in hell you should consider these. try sony's 'hook around the ear' type. way better."
1,Good sound quality? Hardly.,"I went through all the steps to insert the headphones into my ear properly, etc etc etc. They fit nicely, they didn't come out when I tugged, they were in right.The sound quality is horrible. There is little to no bass, and the headphones give you a massive headache after about 15 minutes of use (I switched headphones and no longer felt a headache).These headphones are hardly worth $9.99, let alone the price they're going for. I bought a nice pair of Sony earbuds at Best Buy for $5, and the quality is much, much higher than the quality of these.Sorry, Apple."
5,Fit great!!!!,"I was a little leery about purchasing these earphones due to some of the negative comments regarding the fit. But the standard issue headphones that came with my iPod were too big and hurt my ears. So, I thought that I would give these a try for myself. I had no problem with the fit right out of the box (the medium size). They fit very snug almost suction-like into the ear. They stayed in place, they didn't hurt my ears at all and the sound is very good."
1,Below Apple quality product,"Apple should remove their name from this product. As with other reviews below, I couldn't believe the very cheap and lousy sound quality from these earbuds. They look great and they are comfortable but the sound is so bad what's the point?Perhaps technology and reality have collided here and standard headphones are the only real answer to quality music listening.Don't waste your time and money with this dud bud."
2,Not really worth it,"Okay, so I took the bait and shelled out $40 for these (seems like all the official iPod accessories one wants are $40). Yes, they have good sound, BUT you need to be sure the headphones are jammed down your ear to seal them in there to hear the quality. Five minutes later the seal has broken, and you lose a lot of the bass tones.In summary, yes, they have good sound quality and yes, if you fiddle with them enough you hear all of their sounds and tones, and five minutes later you are doing it again...are they worth $40? No."
2,urg... they look UGLY!,"I'm not sure why they chose such a crappy design, I thought the Apple people were better than this.The sound on these things is pretty good if you JAM the bud into your head. The problem is external. Just when I think you got the earbud in there just right, I'll catch a reflection of myself in a car window with these things sticking (awkwardly) from the sides of my head.They should follow the contours of the human ear! Is that so much to ask? Since ear canals travel upwards, the earbuds should be crooked. These are straight, jutting from the users head very un-sexy like (in contrast to the sleekness of the iPod). Horrible, horrible design. Form over function.Not worth it."
3,No bass on these earbuds,These earbuds aren't nearly as good as the ones that come packaged with the iPod. The bass quality just isn't there. I ended up sending them back.
4,work wonderfully when in...,"I like them and would and do recommend them. They are not perfect, however, and can be a bit of a pain to get and keep in your ear. Once there though... they sound amazing."
4,Way better than the reviews!,"I was looking for a new pair of buds to replace the stck ones that came with my iPod. I do most of my listening on Sennheiser PX 100's, but traveing on trains and planes, etc. I needed something more closed. After comparing I chose the Apples over the Sony 51's, mainly due to the coments about the Sony wires, etc.I will say that I am more than pleased with the Apple buds. I tried all three pads and surprinsgly found the largest fit best. I did the ear pull trick and they made a tight seal. The sound quality is very good with excellent separation of instruments. Now, I'm not an audiophile, but for my classic rock, blues and country these things sound really good. For the price, I am pretty happy so far.While the canal phones are not for everyone, these Apple's do sound very good for the price. Give 'em a shot! I did and was very happy."
2,Good headphones__if you can stand to have them in your ears,"I was going to just return these headphones, but then read the positive reviews here on Amazon, and thought I'd give it a try and follow the directions posted by the gentleman that said I wasn't wearing them correctly. And I have to admit, when I had them crammed into my ears far enough, the sound was amazing. Crystal clear highs and midtones, clear, but not overpowering bass.That being said, they would not stay in my ears. I guess I must have ""abnormal"" ear canals, because I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, even with the smallest earpiece attachments. So my questions is, what good are the best headphones on the planet if you can't get them to stay where they need to be? If you have larger ear canals than me, they might be fine, but for this tightly-ear canaled guy, they just aren't workable."
1,Don't bother with tthese,"Total waste of money, especially if you're a runner, or do any kind of workouts. These buds will fall out of your ears in seconds."
3,An ear too big/ small,"If you are looking at this item, you want first try out these headphones to see if they actually fit your ears, for me I have an ear size that is imbetween large and big. I gave them away as a gift and the person loved them. If you try'em before you buy'em and they fit, then they are totally worth the money."
5,They work great!,"I love these earphones. They sound similar to my pair of Sony MDR-V700, yet they are small enough to wear while out walking around. I don't want to sound rude, but I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didn't stick them in their ears right. You really have to push 'em down in there, if you just place them on the surface, they are going to sound flat, tinny, and just plain awful.Two downsides: 1) during quiet songs you'll hear all of your ""head activity"" loud and clear: chewing, breathing, swallowing... it's all very loud (like when you have your fingers in your ears). 2) The documentation could be a bit better. (For example, let these other people know that they should try on the different caps to see which one works best.)All in all, a very good product!"
1,HORRIBLE,"This sound STINKS - --- -- there is NO bass, it is HORRIBLE quality sound, and the freaking things FALL OUT of your ears, no matter WHAT you do/ HOW you put them in. DON'T BUT THESE! Get the Sony headhones that actually hold in place, foe 10 measly bucks!"
5,"Headphones ""slap""","By the meaning ""Slap"" means that they go very loud to those that don't know the meaning of the Bay Area slang. Very good headphones and very loud"
5,Fantastic!,"I was given these headphones as a gift in October 2005 prior to leaving for Iraq. I used these headphones the entire 22 months that I was deployed, 16 of those months were in Iraq. I found them useful for almost any activity that I did. Listening to my iPod in bed, sitting in my chair watching movies on my laptop, running on the treadmill at the gym etc and I've encountered no problems with them. The sound quality is fantastic. Treble, bass, outside noise reduction ... you name it. I've owned several other headphones...some similar to these and others that are enclosed. It's almost December 2007 and they're still in as good of condition as when I first got them."
1,Not worth the price,"Are they better than the default iPod ear buds? Yes. Are they worth the $50 I paid (now $40 on Amazon)? No. They sound good, but the problem is that they fell apart after only a few months of regular gym going. Maybe something with the sweat? I don't know. The actual sound-producing portion would no longer stay attached to the part that goes in your ear. Disappointing."
4,"Took getting used to, but good sound","When I first got these, I thought they were terrible - really tinny sound with no bass. But then I read Steve from NJ's advice and tried it - much better. You need to put them in a bit, not just sitting in your ear like the old Apple iPod ones. I switched the plastic pieces to the smallest one and pulled up on the top of my ear when I put them in and the sound improved dramatically. You won't hear much of anything outside your ears though, which is either good or bad, depending on your situation."
1,"Terrible, tinny and tossed out",These are the worst earbuds on the market. Plain and simply put they don't fit -- none of the three sizes -- and they don't make anything sound better than my original earbuds that came with the iPod. I returned them after two days of trying and trying and trying to give them a chance. Overall review: S for suck.
4,The Reviews Help Me Figure Out What Was Wrong!,"I've had these for over two months and hated it since day one! But until I went online and look up negative comments and reviews from Amazon, I notice people had positive things to say. So started to read the suggestions from people who like it and Stephen aka svogelpohl from NJ suggestion work perfectly. These little things deliver great sound it just a matter of how you put them inside your ear. You cannot put them in like normal headphones which is kind of crappy but when you get them in correctly they sound awesome. The reason why I don't give a 5 stars is because they completely take away any outside sound from coming in. Thats not good for me who take public transportation in NYC and you have to worry about your surroundings at every stop."
2,"Good sound, but very uncomfortable","I disliked these earbuds because of how uncomfortable they were.The sound was good, but I had to get another set of headphones because I could not stand to wear these earbuds.Thanks:)"
4,Excellent upgrade for iPod,"Based on the quality of the standard iPod headphones, I was hesitant to purchase these as an upgrade. However, with a long wear field test, I am a believer.Yesterday I purchased these headphones at one of the Apple Stores in Chicago and then flew on a direct flight to Anchorage. I had them in my ears for over six hours and I have to say that I am impressed. Fitted correctly they had good bass response and above average mids and highs. Surprisingly, they were comfortable for the entire six hours. I would refit them about once an hour and they continued to sound great and my ears never got sore. Furthermore, because of the plug design, they drowned out more ambient noise than I expected. The only reason I did not give this product a five star review is because I simply have not used them long encough to rate them that highly with confidence."
2,BROKE AFTER ONLY 2 MONTHS!!!!,"When i first got these headphones, they were really good; comfortable, good sound, and small. It was 78 days and the right ear completely shut off! I tried just living with it for about 5 days and found i couldn't stand it. I am now in the process of trying to return them. this is so complicated! If I were you I would not buy these headphones. find some different headphones. thats what ive got to say."
4,Comfortable,"This is a highly comfortable earphone, it works well. The included carrying case helps keep them clean, and untangled in bags.The quality is OK, not stellar though.It's just I'm used to the foam cone variety of earphone, so I often find myself switching back to my old Koss phones."
2,Terrible tinny sound,"I love Apple products - most of them, that is. But these headphones sound as good as a $4.99 pair at Sam Goody - and I was sooo excited about getting them. If you like deep sound, stick with the original earbuds or find another brand. These in-ear ones are three steps down from average (I can't believe Apple would stand behind these lemons and actually promote them as ""high quality). I returned mine the morning after and never looked back. Please save your $ or invest it elsewhere."
1,Not a good trade off,I was hoping they would sound better than the ear buds that came with the iPod but they are the worst sounding headphones I have ever used. They are so tinny I can't stand using them. Sure they are way more comfortable than the buds that came with the ipod but I think I would rather have slightly sore ears than goose bumps from such horrible sound. They do sound better if you cram them deep in your ears but they wont stay there with any of the 3 sizes of rubber pads.
5,great headphones,"this headphones deliver great sound definition and a lot of bass, if you use them correctly. overall, a great buy!!!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,Ordered these because the supplied earbuds don't fit and keep falling out. There may be one person out of a billion whose ears suit the hard round buds. The new ones fit a lot better but the sound quality was very poor with a hissing sound. Did a test with the family and everyone prefered the old ones. Sent these back (amazon had the nerve to deduct $5 from the refund) and now waiting for Sennheisers px 100 in white. Also the Shure earbuds are great if you can afford the price. ipods rule but their earbuds are garbage.
4,Apple In-Ears Headphones = Overall Great,"These headphones have very nice bass response, high frequency clarity, and noise cancellation. The headphones are a great improvement over the headphones that come with the iPod.Main Problems -It definately takes some time to get used to wearing these headphones. After deciding which size ear pieces fit you must be willing to work with them to get the best fit.But this time is well spent. Once you learn to seal these into your ears, the listening experience should be quite enjoyable. These headphones are far more comfortable than the standard issue headphones.I hope you enjoy...(...)"
1,"Do not buy these for running, exercise","I have liked these headphones for sitting and listening but it is absolutely impossible to run or exercise with them. Besides not staying in your ears they have two heavy connectors that serve to pull the buds out of your ears while creating more noise than the iPod itself. Unless all you need are phones for the airplane, these are probably not for you."
3,Good Fit Critical,"Takes a lot of trial and error with the different ear pieces to get a good fit and good sound (balanced bass). You need a tight fit. I can see how some folks just can't use these, depending upon their ears. I am happy, the sound is superior to the ear buds that come with the iPod."
1,mislead by other reviews,"Having read a number of the reviews here, I'm trying to figure out if they are using the same product that I am. These are actually far worse than the ear bud's that come with the iPod. Even most sony ear buds sound far better than these.Fit was really not an issue...it was mainly the sound. I will admit that very high end sound was pretty clear, but contrary to what other viewers have said, the low-end bass is horrible. I tried messing with the different caps and fit, but even with the buds fitting quite snugly in the hear, the sound is just horrible."
1,Do not buy these earbuds,"Do not buy these earbuds.They hurt your ears, have thin and flat sound, and (unless you plan on remaining completely still while listening to your iPod) will fall out of your ears about every two minutes.The only way for me to get decent sound in these things was to press the ""buds"" all the way into my ears - and they usually stayed there for about 30 seconds.I didn't think that Apple would ever put out a substandard product. But now I know better!Anything good about them? They look nice....."
2,THEY HURT LIKE CRAZY,I just got my ipod shuffle and the earphones came with them. After only 15 minutes of listening to them it felt like I had devloped a ear infection. They are extremly good quality. They can become very loud[a car full of talking girls could hear the music just not so clearly].
1,TERRIBLE SOUND AND FIT,"These things sound like you are listening to music inside a tin can. Where's the bass? In fact, where is that stereo sound that the first iPod headphones had? And I hate the way these feel in my ear. That flimsy piece of rubber is so uncomfortable that I wouldn't wear these even if they had decent sound. Definitely not worth the money!"
2,"ibuds, NOT","Very little bass, hence too much treble and they don't stay in the ear.Shure at this price much better sound except the wire is too thin and breaks easily."
2,Good sound for a little while.,"They sounded good for a week. Bought these apple in ear headphones and after one week one of the buds had stopped working completely and the other ear had a terrible crackle. Extremely poorly made product. For 40 bucks, apple screwed me."
5,Disregard Disappointment,"Okay after reading reviews on another web site, I decided to give these another try. I must say they are a bit tricky to get in your ears, as you must pull back the top of your ear away from your head and ""seal"" the plugs in. After this is achieved, the result is astounding. No ""tinny"" sounds and a lot more bass. MUCH better than the original plugs you get with your ipod. Outside noise is eliminated almost completely, which means you don't have to ""up"" your volume as much for these. And they didn't fall out as I cycled this morning, so that's another plus."
2,Disappointed,"If you like the slightest bit of bass in your music, DO NOT purchase these earbuds. My ipod now sounds like a cheap, battery powered, one speakered AM radio. Each of my ears gave them a star for the comfort factor. That's the only good thing I can say about these overpriced headphones."
3,"They're nice, but I expected a little more","Just got my headphones today, and I'll be honest, they're nice but I wanted a little better sound. Size and fit isn't even an issue with me. Once I found the right size cover for my ear they felt AMAZING. I literally can't even feel them in my ears. But the sound quality is lacking in my opinion. I am a huge hip-hop fan so I like nice deep bass response in a pair of headphones and quite frankly, the pair that come with your iPod have better bass than these. Other than that, I am happy with these headphones and recommend them to someone looking for a slightly inexpensive upgrade."
3,"Better than Stock, but not the best overall.","I received these headphones for my birthday, and while they are far and away better than the stock IPOD earphones, I think for the money, the KOSS: THE PLUG in ear headphones sound better and are better, overall, at blocking out noise.Acoustic guitar and and piano is crystal clear on the Apple earphones, probably better than the Koss, but the bass is a little less rich and the noise reduction not nearly as good.As everyone suggests, having the right fit is imperitive to getting better sound, but if you're traveling and have your earphones in and out all of the time as I do, I'd give the Koss a try.I like these Apple earphones, they are extraordinarily comfortable, especially compared to the stock IPOD phones, I and will use them in controlled environments like my office, but on the road I think I'll stick with my cheap and funky Koss phones."
1,Waste of money,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge home theater junkie/car audiophile so I take my music very seriously. I thought that these ear buds would be a great upgrade for my iPod. They look great, have the typical terrific Apple packaging, and claimed to stay in your ears better. Musically, I was looking for a little more dynamic range and volume. What I got was actually very brassy sound with no bass what-so-ever. I actually thought that something had happened to my iPod when I plugged them in. It was painful to listen to. Needless to say, when I found out that the buds were the source of the problem, I wound up giving them away. I assure you, these are not worth 40 dollars. I am very disappointed in Apple for this one."
1,Abyssmal,"The fact that these headphones have a 3-star rating causes me to lose confidence in the Amazon review system. After my Sennheiser CX500s died and had to be returned, I thought I would use these headphones until I bought a suitable replacement. After about 20 seconds of trying, I decided to toss them. Compared to the Sennheisers, they sound like listening to a tinny radio while wearing metal bucket over your head. Only by shoving them as far as I could into my ear canal and actually holding them there did I get them to approach an near-acceptable sound. If these were meant to be canal phones, their bulbous shape certainly doesn't make them easy to use as such, as it just causes them to push themselves out of the ear. Please, please do yourself a favor and buy some real earphones."
2,"They are OK, not worth $30 to $50 bucks---depending on where you purchase them...","I was really excited about getting the Apple In-Ear headphones. I looked all over the places, tried many pairs on, and could never get them to fit just right. I bought the Apple headphones because I thought that they were a good company and sold good products. Which they do, but the headphones would simply not fit my ears correctly. They would fall out. I am planning on returning them. Just know that if you can't get them to fit, you will not enjoy them."
3,"Bass ok, mid-range not there. Too much high.","As to not staying in your ears, it is all true. You have to sit absolutely still to keep these things in your ears. If you fly for a long time, you'll find yourself constantly adjusting the buds. Forget about running with these.As to the sound, it produces decent enough sound with firm bass, if not too much. If you put these in your ears ""properly"", you'll definitely notice the bass. At times, my ear drums felt like they were being pushed in.The high end is too sharp, so I had to use the EQ to bring the treble down. I must admit that this was the first time I actually turned the treble ""down"" in my life.The mid-range is not there. I'm a rock fan and love high bass/high treble sound, but I missed the firm mid-range with this set.At $40, I think you'll find better options than this, though I coughed up over $100 and went for Shure e3c."
3,maybe I just have small ears....,"This ear phones didn't work for me at all. After twisting and pushing and otherwise jamming them into my ears (I tried all three sizes), they'd only stay in for ten seconds before popping out again. I will say though that they're very comfortable and the sound quality is better than the regular ipod earbuds. I imagine that if they'd stayed in my ears that I would've loved them.Radio Shack has a similar pair that are half price, FYI."
3,Better than the ear buds but...,"After a year of wearing the ear buds that come stock with the iPod, I finally got a pair of these and initially I was extremely pleased. They felt great and there was no little foam piece to keep losing all the time so all was good. Then I took them on a jog for the first time and noticed that they kept falling out of my ears after a few minutes of bouncing around. Also, they sound great when you first put them in your ears but they eventually work their way ""loose"" and you end up losing alot of the bass. Maybe I just have wierd-shaped ears but I tried all three sizes and it seems there are alot of people complaining about the same thing in the reviews. Anyway, I went out and bought Sony's MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones (originally for my wife's iPod but I'm keeping them for myself!).What a huge difference! They sound terrific and fit like a pair of earplugs so they dont fall out while jogging."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Apple In-Ear Headphones about a month ago.While it is possible to get a decent sound by pushing the headphones far into the ear, I found this position to be very uncomfortable. In any other position the music sounds as if it is being played through a tin can.Even though the case includes several different sizes of ear buds, none of them seemed to fit comfortably and stay within the ear for an extended period of time. Running with these headphones was extremely frustrating as they would fall out about every 30 seconds.Overall, I am disappointed in this product. I will gladly return to using the headphones that came with my iPod."
3,great but they rarely fit and the right side keeps blowing,if your me and like to listen to music as loud as you can possibly than u will love these for the first 2 days until your speaker blows. i went throught two pairs im even to tierd to go back to the apple store. if u want my suggestion buy the sony 25 doller ones they are awesome and they dont break.
3,"Hoping for GREATNESS... only ""average-ness""","Hi all! Let me start out with I LOVE MY IPOD! Love it! I really like the ear buds that came with my little 20 gig 3rd gen baby! Since I've had that, a little over a year now, I've been on the manhunt for something better, but not too expensive. To put it simple... it just doesn't exist! I thought these ""in ear"" babies would be awesome, not so. If you LOVE treble... then these are for you. I'm a very ""a little more treble than bass"" kind of guy, and these in ear headphones just don't give the extra bass like the ear buds do that actually come with your iPod. So, I gave it a 3 out of 5. AWESOME Apple design, of course, but the driver isn't up to specs like the ""come with the iPod"" phones! Don't want to spend too much, then stick with what you got. I've heard great things about Shure (sp?) headphones, but I could almost buy a iPod mini for that price! Thanks, and ""pod On!"""
1,Don't waste the money,"I am a marketers dream. I wanted an apple genuine headphone and these fit the bill. I have CRAMMED these things in while pulling on the tops of my ears, twisting the buggers, licking then pushing and twisting.....blah bliggity blah blahBOTTOM LINE I spent forty dollars for headphones. They should stay in when you take a deep breath, let alone jog on a treadmill or walk down the street. Stick with the earphones apple gives you. These S-U-C-K."
3,"Better than normal earbuds, but the Griffin EarThumps win.","I bought these headphones soon after they were released, and was extremely pleased with them. As many professional reviewers have noted, their design priority of directing sound into your ear rather than maximizing their volume produces great results, when worn correctly.However, I recently bought the Griffin EarThumps, which follow the same design philosophy, but are LESS THAN HALF the price of Apple's. When I did a direct comparison, with constant volume coming from my Mac, the Griffins' volume is DOUBLE that of these.The day of these headphones has passed. Kudos to Apple for having the value advantage over competitors like Shure for a time, but as of the time of this writing, they have been bested by Griffin."
5,The ear pulling makes all the difference!,"Whoever shared the idea of pulling up the ear before inserting is showered with my praise! At first, I was only so so on these headphones. I had previously owned a similar Sony pair, which I thought I got better sound from. Then, I lost one of the inserts (actually, I lost all but one of them) so I decided to try the Apple version. At first, I thought the sound lacked some of the bass that the Sony headphones gave, but after reading the advice I tried it, and everything is now amazing. The sound is so much deeper, and the tight fit drowns out noises such as crowds and the subway (very noisy). I highly recommend these headphones, as long as you do the ear thing!"
5,Definitive answer--truly good,"After reading all the incredibly positive and incredibly negative reviews, I picked up a pair in disbelief that they could actually be bad. I was right; they are incredible headphones. I promise you--anyone saying they sound ""tinny"" or ""like an AM/FM radio"" or ""lacking bass"" simply did not bother pushing the rubber tip deep enough into their ear canal. It's THAT simple. Since they come with 3 difference size tips, there's just no excuse."
4,I finally got it right,"I confess it took me a while to get the hang of these little guys, that's why I'm giving them 4 stars only. Having tried my friends original headphones and realizing they were very unconfortable and actually hurt my ears after wearing them for a while, I decided to buy the in-ear Apple headphones when I first got my ipod. At first I tried the medium and the small ear caps since I don't have particularly big ears, but as it has been mentioned before I only managed to get them stay into place when I wasn't moving, excercising or chewing! To my surprise when I tried the large size caps they stayed in my ears even when jogging! What a delight! I'm no sound electronics expert or anything, just a regular music lover, and I must say that with these headphones I have discovered sounds in my favourite songs that I didn't even know were there! A little tricky at first but in the end, a satisfying purchase."
1,Didn't Last,"I bought these phones because the original ear buds fell out of my ear too easily while using my iPod at the gym. These were much better in terms of staying put while I was moving around. But after a couple of months, one of the ear phones just went silent. Probably a bum wire.At forty dollars for a pair, I'd say that shouldn't happen.Maybe I got a bum pair. Maybe they're not well made. But consider durability when thinking of purchasing this one!"
1,The worst headphones ever.,"Despite the many bad reviews, I thought I would judge for myself. They really are horrible headphones. Which is kind of hard to tell since you can't get them to stay in your ears long enough. I just bought them yesterday and they are going back to the store today."
1,These suck...,Anyone that posts a positive review for these earphones is most likely an Apple executive. I bought these for my wife who had trouble fitting the standard headphones in her tiny ears. At $40 a pop I was expecting earphones with an adjustable earpiece that would be at least comparable in sound quality to the standard set. What I got were earphones that are difficult to fit in any size ear and are vastly inferior in sound quality. I can't send them back quickly enough.
2,Not On My Wish List,My Headphones were working great but i dont know what's going on with them..my sound is sounding horrible and the wire is very weak so u can get a short very fast.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,"They do not fit everyone, myself included.","These headphones do not fit! This is the first time I have felt ripped off by Apple. I'm sorry, but I won't just shut up about it. If Apple is so great, why don't they design a premium pair of headphones that fits everyone? I don't know if I have ""tiny ear canals,"" but honestly, it is no fault of my own. If Apple wanted to show a higher degree of engineering, they should have designed them better. No, I will not buy the Shure E2C foam caps to make them fit my ears. Its poor consumerism. I already know Amazon won't take them back, because ::gasp:: I have removed the headphones from the original packaging! The celophane seal has been broken! So I am going to write a letter to Apple. Their response will determine if they will continue to enjoy my business or not. Call it trivial, but these were not cheap."
1,The only thing worse is . . .,"Apple service. Maybe I have gotten the one from the bunch, but apple ear buds stink! Mine quit working 3 months after I go them and apple says basicly ""too bad, so sad.""Stay away from this!"
5,QUALITY PIECE OF GEAR MAN !!!!!!,This product is pure mental the sounds are solid and it makes me wet my pants with excitement. i would recommed this quality piece of gear to anyone 0141 !!!!!!!
1,JohnCPA,"These are the worse I've tried!! It's a shame Apple's brand is on them!I bought Phillips Earphones (At half the price) and they give you a fuller sound, and SOOOO much better Bass!Apple needs to address this quality issue."
1,SCAM!!!,"These things stink. The only way I got them to work was if I sat completely still. Even then they were slipping out. Don't even think about buying these if you plan on walking, workingout, or nodding your head while using them. The most disappointing purchase of my life!!! Too bad my ear buds broke."
1,SOOOO not worth it!,"Ive bought these earphones expecting at the very least an improvement over my stock ipod earbuds, but nope, totally not the case. they didnt even compare in sound and ease of use to the originals. you REALLY do have to stick these deep in your ear if you want that"
1,Lasted All of Two Days.,"Sound quality is OK -- I mainly bought them for their noise-cancelling qualities -- but both drivers were blown after two days of moderate, medium-volume use. My advice: stay away like the plague."
5,Excellent in-ear headphones!,"For a minute I was put off by some of the other reviews but I figured I had geneically normal ears so why worry. They fit in perfectly first try and became like an intrigal part of my head and I did not even notice they were in, very confortable, and they do not slip out.They sound amazing all across the spectrum, great bass, I had to adjust my equalizer slightly to compinsate. I don't have to crank up my system volume on laptop like my previous Sony over the ear phones, and I am hearing elements of the music I had never heard before."
5,Fantastic Product.,"These are some of the best earphones I've ever owned. I mainly use my ipod while I'm at work, and these block out the majority of office noise. I've read the other reviews where people say they don't fit properly in the ear. These earphones are a lot like earplugs, you have to twist the soft rubber and insert it into your ear, and it'll fit itself comfortably in your ear canal. I've also found that I'm listening to my music at a much lower volume. You don't need it nearly as high as you do with the earbuds that come standard with the ipods.These earphones are a major step up from the ones that came with the ipod mini. I'm very very pleased with this purchase and would strongly recommend these to anyone who wants the best sound out of their ipod - they're worth the steep price."
2,"They might look good and all, but quality of sound is ...","I did test those in-ear headphones for about 2 -4 hours and was totally disappointed. High frequency sounds are OK, but low frequency (bass) is totally bad. If you appreciate bass ( drums ) I would advice in-ear headphones by Sony which are much better in sound quality. I were disappointed with that item but I am not going to return it. If I just could know that they are not good on low frequencies I would never get them. If you are fan of a pop music I think you will like it a lot they are very good with high frequencies."
2,Not for jogging,I tried them for jogging and was very disappointed. I had to wrap them around my hand and jog musicless because they kept falling out.
3,Inserting upside down be the trick for hard to seal ears,"I like these headphones better than the standard iPod headphones and The Plugs, but not quite as well as my Shure E2s. They seem a little more midrangy than the E2s, but they have more high end and more accurate bass than The Plugs.Getting these to seal in my ear canal was a problem for me. I found that if I inserted them with wires pointing to the 9 or 10 o'clock position instead of down I got a great seal with little effort. It looks kind of goofy, but they sound decent.Overall I'd go with the E2s. They are more accurate, almost industructable and have many different earpieces so you can't miss on the fit. The E2s also do a better job of sealing out outside noise if that is what you ar looking for.The Apple M9394 make decent casual listening headphones."
1,No way,"I don't know if I have ""irregularly shaped"" ear canals or simply ear canals that don't match the size of the ear buds Apple makes. I do know that I've tried jamming these things into my ears every which way and the sound is wreteched. I've followed all of the advice here and these things still don't do it. Obviously some people adore them, which is great. I agree that you should try them before you purchase them. If it takes you under two seconds to get them on and sounding good, do it. If not, forget it."
2,Horrible Headphones,"I'm currently on my fourth set of Apple in-ear headphones. I had the same problem with the previous three: the red strip of glue holding the silver part to the white weakens within time, and the earbuds keep falling apart, exposing their inner wires. I shove the wires back in, try to firmly press the silver part in, but it just doesn't hold.I'm by no means rough on my headphones; I do work out and run constantly, which might contribute to the band's weakening (e.x. moisture from sweat weakens the glue inside), but Apple is doing a disservice by not making them one solid piece and continuing to manufacture them as two pieces held together by a thin, weak band.I've had them replaced free of charge by Apple each time, but I think I'm through with the Apple In-Ear Headphones after this set inevitably separates."
2,Good for some things,"Here's the scoop: if you enjoy listening to music while drifting off to sleep, these are great. It's almost like they're not there at all. If that's worth the price for you, then go for it. But don't think you're getting headphones for everyday use. The sound is, indeed on the tinny side, even when fitted properly (which does help a great deal). Most of the time, that doesn't matter too much, but here's the deal-killer for me: I really enjoy listening to piano music. I love Chopin, Keith Jarrett, and listen to them very frequently. These earphones render anything with piano unlistenable. The piano will be distorted and fuzzy, almost invariably, even at very low volumes. If you won't be listening to this type of music, or, as I said before, you want to listen to music while you're drifting off to sleep, these might be what you're looking for. But buyer beware if you enjoy piano music."
2,"slip, sliding away...","While they deliver a fine stream of music, these headphones should not be bought by anyone planning on using them while running. They will fall out. And then slip out. And slide out. And, finally, fall out again. Really. In fact, I think my arms got a better work out trying to keep them in then my legsYes, these headphones arrive with 3 different ear piece sizes -- but they all fell out (some less frequently than others). Now, if you're planning on riding a plane, a subway, a train, a bus, or the like, these will be super fine. But not a horse. (A cow would be fine.)"
1,Aren't they supposed to stay in your ears?,"I paid $40 for these ear buds to replace the ones that came with the iPod. I was not impressed. The darn things would not stay in my ears. The sound was OK, but that doesn't matter much if they don't fit."
1,Lasted A Bit More Than a Month,"Great sound for about a month. And comfortable.But after a little more than a month of NORMAL use on an IPOD, the right channel decided to blow -- and now delivers only distorted sound.Normal use = moderate volume listening almost exclusively to jazz. And great care in storage. Apparently the bass of routine jazz is too much for these headphones.Don't waste your money on a superior product that becomes useless after one month of usage according to product guidelines.My headphones are in the trash."
1,Frustrating,"The best review I have read on these headphones was, ""The opposite of good"". Read it, for I couldn't have said it better myself.From my experience, it takes an act of God to actually fit these perfectly in my ear. It's as if I have to wait for the stars to align before i can hear the sound at its finest. Jogging? You can absolutely forget it. You'd be better off jogging in roller blades. Every step pulls at the ear piece and kills the sound quality. I literally jogged a hundred feet before i just put the ipod in my pocket.The sound, when ever so perfectly placed in my ear, is great. The problem is, getting it to fit perfectly in your ear is like building a house of cards. We can apparently put human beings on the moon, but we absolutely cannot figure out how to make great headphones. This is yet another dissapointing headphone. Whenever I purchased my $300 iPod, I never thought I would delve into the frustrating world of buying headphones. Unfreakingreal."
2,not for me,"I read the reviews - I tried the methods for getting them to stay deep in my ear canal - I tried all 3 different size adjusters, but they wouldn't stay in. Actually, my right ear they would stay in nicely - my left ear they just wouldn't stay in. I did try different sizes in each ear, but they just would not stay in. They would slowly slip out and sound tinny and high-pitched, or when moving around at all, they would come out very quickly. When they did stay in (or, I held them in with my fingers) the sound was great - I think this is one of those cases where Apple puts form before function, violating the age-old design rule of form follows function...I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP in-ear headphones. The sound isn't QUITE as good - you do get great bass, but not quite as deep or balanced as the Apple's. But, they stuck in my ears without a problem from the beginning."
3,"Like all Apple products: nice design, poor durability","I have small ears, and these fit perfectly. I thought they had very good sound. Unfortunately, after about six months (and I don't use the iPod that often) the right one broke, and so now I have to buy a new pair. These are pretty expensive to replace on a regular basis, and so I'm not sure what kind to buy. Perhaps if these were stored in a good case they would last longer, but that takes a lot of care."
3,Maintenance hassle,"I thought these were great when I first got them, the sound was much better than the standard ipod headphones. I was one of the lucky ones that was able to get a good fit with them, so they didn't fall out. Even so, they still weren't all that comfortable.The sound quality does fade with time. I finally figured out that this was due to a buildup of earwax (yuck!) over the speaker grill. Not at all easy to get clean, but if you do, the sound comes back."
3,go with the sony fontopia's instead,"these headphones demonstrate that there can be negative consequences for placing preeminence on form rather than function. in giving these headphones a smooth, ergonomic design, apple fatally impaired their ability to work right. in fact, the design of these headphones causes them to gradually slide out of your ear. i bought them to listen to while i run, but the bouncing made using them literally impossible. what i actually ended up doing, was taking the rubber earbuds from my sony fontopia headphones and using them instead of the ones apple provided. of course, then they worked fine, but i felt ridiculous. after using these headphones for a while, i switched back to my sony MDR-EX71SL, and found the sound quality in the sonys way better. the sound was clearer, and the bass more intense and deep. ironically, by that point, i noticed so many people wearing white headphones that i feel more dissenting by wearing black headphones. consider it......"
3,"good color, doesn't last","I have 90% gray, have had it since I was 18, so I color my hair and roots frequently. I liked the idea of an herbal color and thought I would give this a try. The color was good, but I had to recolor with a traditional, loaded with chemicals brand within 2 wks. This is great in theory and maybe if you have less gray it would work great, but for me a miss."
3,Fair Product,Faded after awhile.. color is great..doesn't look false.I like it because it doesn't have the bad chemicals othercolors have.
4,Solid album by two great guitar players,"Phil Keaggy is one of my favorite (and the best) guitar players ever. I've not been a huge fan of his vocal work and/or lyrics, though. Basically, I'm a fan of his instrumental work (both electric and acoustic), and what he stands for and the kind of guy he is. However, here he is combined with Stonehill, another great guitar player (and one whose vocals I don't mind so much, but still not my favorite). Together I find this to be one of the best vocal outings by either one, and their guitars together are beautiful. Recommended if you're a fan of either musician, or just a fan of guitar in general. Would have been cool if they had some extra tracks of just them jamming, though."
3,Covers too many topics with not enough details,"I was a bit disapointed with this book after reading the reviews.I found this book to be more like the ARRL Handbook in the sensethat it covered many topics but without details.For example, in the filter chapter it referenced FIR and IIR filters butdid not explain what they were. I already knew but, if you already know thenwhat new information is this book adding. One or two paragraphs on about 25 different subjects just ends up being a confusing mess. It should instead focuson 10 important topics and go in to detail on those. Just briefly touching a bunch of different areas really does no good except forces the reader to seek other books to figure out what they are talking about.As a side note I am happy with a book called ""RF Circuit Design"" by Chris Bowick. It covers a few topics from the ground up and shows you a design process. The chapter on filters showed me how to design a filter in 20 minutes."
4,Great information terrible printing,"I would like to echo what others are saying about this great book.It has tons of great information that is well explained.One big problem is tons of missing words.It really bothers me when I spend this amount of money for such a poorly printed book.At least they could make a list so I could fill in the missing words,many of which you have no way of telling what is missing."
5,wow,this book should have more reviews. it is one of the best books i have read and i read alot. it touched my heart and my soul.
5,Best One Yet,"I enjoyed this GLH book best of all I've read so far. The story was believable, and had good twists. Though her stories follow a familiar thread, they're varied enough to keep my intrest. I've also enjoyed the light-hearted subjects as opposed to mystery and intrigue which tends to make me anxious and unsettled."
4,Heartwarming,I found this book hard to put down. An awesome love story overshadowed by Gods design for us and His blessings when we are faithful to His word.
3,Not for the casual Buffy fan,"This book is for people who are -really- into the Buffyverse: the hard-core fans. I'm more of a casual fan, and gave up reading partway through. I can see, though, how others might find it to be compelling reading.To summarize, it's a series of critiques of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series, much in the same way one might critique literature as part of a college course. The author looks for themes, symbolism, patterns, hidden (and not so hidden) meaning, allegories, etc. And while I like the show, I'm just not into it that much."
3,Classic Literature & Buffy,"This reader has no qualms mixing philosophy/literature and television entertainment; as long as there's a sense of fun or frivolity; no such luck with ""Why Buffy Matters:"". There were a few enlightening chapters concerning origins of character names and similarities between BTVS and Harry Potter. Wilcox focused on a few episodes of BTVS to analyze in terms of philosophy, literature and current events. If you are a fan of the following episodes ""The Zeppo"" and ""Restless"", the in depth analysis might intrigue. Wilcox also breaks down the underpinning text on the most talked about episodes: ""Once More With Feeling"", ""Hush"" and ""The Body"", but her analysis of these episodes didn't enlighten this reader. One could get similar information from Buffy boards; with more feeling. I didn't object to the Ten-dollar words used throughout the book, but just using these words constantly marks of pretentiousness. ""Why Buffy Matters:""; informative, yes; fun, no."
2,buffy/angel fan,"the book was ok but just for a read not to have,rhonda talk about other things then just buffy which i didnt like i got a bit bored with it and skip a few pages,i have read better books."
5,One of the Best Fantasies,"I first read the Dark is Rising sequence when I was about ten. The characters and the worlds absolutely fascinated me; Cooper shows that a world of magic and wonder might dwell right among us in our ordinary world. Cooper, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien and Lloyd Alexander were my four great reads, and all four of them I reread today. The writing itself is beautiful, not so hard that a child might have trouble reading it, yet poetic enough to make your heart sing. To get a sense of the tone of the series, all you have to do is read the two poems before each book. I've had them memorized for years, and they capture the flavor of Cooper's world. Definitely recommended to anyone, no matter the age."
5,This is a great series of books to read to your child.,I loved them as a child and read them to my younger brother as well. There is the eternal battle between good and evil contained in these books without the overwelmingly scary parts that can create nightmares. The main characters are children that kids can easily relate to. I prefer these over the Narnia series and I love that set of books as well.
5,Excellent!,These series of books are an excellent and exciting read. I loved them from the word go. Well done Susan Cooper!
5,The Dark is Rising Boxed set (all five volumes),I thoroughly enjoyed these books. They got better as they went along. I loved the weaving in of Arthurian legend.
4,"Five Star Stories, Two Star Binding","I agree with the reviewers who have called this sequence well-written and imaginative, and I defer to their analyses of Susan Cooper's excellent books. I just wanted to let other buyers know that, although the artwork on the cover is lovely and appropriate, the binding itself isn't the greatest. The cover is crazy-thin cardstock, and the pages are quite delicate. I'm not sure that this copy is going to survive many readings, and you certainly don't want to try reading it in the bathtub. It's a shame, but on the other hand, it is nice to find such a reasonably priced collection of all of these stories together!"
3,I would like it to have more excitement,"I liked these books but there were a few dull parts in the beginning of the ""Dark Is Rising"" and ""Over Sea, Under Stone"". If there were a few more adventures I would recommend them more."
5,A series that is wonderful and delightful for all ages,This series of books beging with Over Sea and Under stone to the very last one is a wonderful coherent set of books. The author Susan Cooper keep a theme running through all five books that is highly intricate and inventive. The first time I read the books to just this past week when I read them again I was inspired by her imagery and story telling. I highly recomend these books to any one who like to read. IF you don't like to read then this is a good series to get you started. Again I say this is a wonderful collection of books for all to read and you can be sure that me childern will read them too
4,Excellent young readers material drawing upon Celtic mythos.,"Susan Cooper's Old Ones (or The Dark) series presents a taleof good versus evil. A group of kids stumbles upon ancientsecrets, and one discovers that he is himself one of the Old Ones,a group of immortals (or near immortals) dedicated to fightingthe chaos and evil of The Dark and its minions.The novels draw upon myths of England and the Isles, and theclimax is certainly rewarding..."
5,Best Kids Books EVER,I've read these books about 10 times each since I was a kid and they never get old.
5,The Dark is Rising: Back in my collection!,"When I was twelve my grandmother gave these to me. I thought they were a bit babyish (advanced reader) but after reading them I learned the joy of reading something just for fun. These are probably the first books that I slowed myself down and actually enjoyed reading. Half a dozen moves later and I couldn't find the series in any boxes. Thankfully my sister-in-law picked these up as a christmas gift. Now I am happily ensconced reading these again, before I put them into my classroom library."
5,Great set! & Great price!,"I really enjoyed all 5 of these books. I had read The Dark is Rising previously and liked it enough to purchase and read the other books in the sequence; and I was not disappointed. If you like Arthurian lore, British history and fantasy then this is for you!"
4,"Great series, but this printing is UGLY!","I purchased this series, having read it a long time ago as a young teen, and found it to be every bit as good as I remembered. My only complaint is that this boxed set version has some truly terrible CGI art on the cover. I remember the edition I read as a child was very mysterious and ancient-looking. It's too bad that that much superior artwork was not used for this edition. That's the only thing that stands between this set, and my 5th star."
4,The Dark is Rising (Boxed Set),If you are a fan of King Aurthur legend and lore you will relish these books. Susan Cooper's ability to draw the reader into the tale and keep you turning page after page was remarkable. A good read for anyone 10 years old and up.
5,Excellent classic young/teen fantasy,"I remember reading this series when I was, oh, probably about 12 years old. I loved it then - well written, interesting twists and turns, and great pacing. My wife and I are re-reading it aloud now, and I find it has stood the test of time very well."
4,The REAL Dark is Rising series,"This is a wonderfully creative and imaginative series. Don't be fooled by the movie of a similar name (The Seeker"" the Dark is Rising.) The movie has made many, many changes. Discover the real mystery and excitement in Susan Cooper's writing."
5,The Dark is Rising Sequence,"For all fans of Harry Potter the Dark is Rising books would also be a great book sequence. It includes magic, fantasy, and many other things. I cannot stop thinking about them! Susan Cooper uses such good descriptions that you actually feel as if you were there. This is a great sequence I can't get Merriaman, Lyon, Will Stanton, Jane, Simon, and Barney Drew, the lady, the Grey King, and all the others out of my head. You would reaaly enjoy these books. They are great books. (...)"
4,Susan Cooper,"What a Gem. I can't believe that after almost 20 years I'm writing a review of these timeless character pieces. Susan Coopers novels helped me learn the meaning of courage as a child and I hope to pass them along to my family as well. The thread of fanasty is so much more easliy read than Tolkien, and such a vivid tapastry of legend and personal imagination. I feel that they are as worth while as ""the Lion, the Witch and the wardrobe"" for building everlasting beliefs in what is good and right."
5,The best children's series you didn't read!,"This is a fast paced, high action multi-layered series not for the feeble minded. It is no accident the one of these books is a nNewberry winner and another a Newberry honor. Cooper deftly weaves history, Myth and fun into a strong collection of stories. The best part, unlike most series, is that each story can stand on it's own, but together--Wow! younger readers might not appreciate all of Cooper's nuances, but on a subtle, subconscious level the appreciation is unmistakable! The advanced reader will be challenged by forgeign locations and historical Myths. Read them and you will believe."
5,Best fantasy series ever written!,"I first read the Dark Is Rising sequence when I was in 5th grade (16 years ago - yikes!) and I have yet to find another fantasy series that feels so genuinely, hauntingly magical. Cooper's writing style is simple and lacks the flowery prose that is common in many popular fantasy novels, but the enchanted atmosphere she creates is perfect. I can't recommend this series enough.If you like these books, I would also recommend reading Seaward."
5,A walk to a endless hope....,reading these was like touching a soul it was marvels it was scary it was buetiful i said this before these are and well be the greatest books i ever read ...
5,Inspiring,"I was eight when I first read ""Over Sea, Under Stone"" and the memory still burns strong in my memory. It was the book that turned me onto the wonders of reading and I have not looked back since. Thankyou Susan Cooper."
5,My compliments to the author of this wonderful series!,"I first heard about the Dark is Rising Sequence several months ago and decided to read it. I'm so glad I did. These books,with there colorful descriptions and many interesting characters, have become some of my favorites. I would recommend them to any fan of the Chronicles of Narnia or the Tolkien books."
4,The Dark is Rising,"I purchased the box set as an extra credit assignment for my 12th grade class to read while we were reading Le Morte de Arthur. I wondered if they would like it since the reading level is around 7th grade, but the students who chose to do the extra credit loved the books. It shows a different perspective on the Arthurian legends, and the books were highly engaging. I highly recommend the series."
4,Great series for tweens,This is a great series for fantasy readers everywhere. The plot line is well thought out and the characters are real and fantastic. A welcomed addition to any library!
5,Young and Old,Read the second book back in the seventies and never forgot it.Now at 52 I can finally finish the series.I guess living long enough has its privileges.These are good stories. Enjoy them while you can.
2,Too old for my child?,"I ordered the correct title but the incorrect author. I liked the packaging and illustrations on the covers. My son who is 11 and an avid advanced reader is having a difficult time with this book. He has only read 35 of the pages yet has finished 3 R.L. Stine in a week. He says that the letters are too small and too many words on a page. He also mentioned that if a book fails to grab his attention quickly, he is apt to read no further. He is struggling to read this to please me as this was a birthday gift and the correct title he requested. I will encourage him to continue to read it and perhaps read it myself to offer a further opinion."
1,Although it's cute it does not perform well,"First thing -I don't know if this a problem with all the dolls, but when I removed the doll from the box it smelled real bad. It had like a mildew smell to it.Second -The doll does not perform like the commercial. When you place the doll in a hiding spot, you have what is called a handheld unit or walkie-talkie that has three colored rings on it to indicate cold, warm or hot. Most of the time you can pass right by the doll and the light indicator does not change.Third- The doll has some cute sayings, but they are to frequent and after awhile you just want to shut it off, because it can give you a headache. The doll also requires eight AAA batteries.Overall I was not happy with this items performance, the only thing my Daughter enjoyed most about the doll was the hand held unit and even that was put down in less than hour.Had my Daughter not been so excited to start playing with this doll and ripped the box to pieces I would have returned it."
1,hide n seek doll,this item did not work right for us had to send it back. but it is a neat idea for kids.
2,HORRIBLE!,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old daughter, and it never worked from the minute it came out of the box. She can be standing on top of it and it stil tells her she is far away! Unortunately, I can't find my receipt to return it, but take it from us - you will be very disappointed. (...)"
2,Not The Best Burner,"I bought this for camping as it was cheap and lightweight. However, I was disappointed with its basic functions. The wind break or `baffles' really didn't work that well and the breeze was always blowing out my fuel supply. The four rubber base supports kept falling off in the dirt and really were more of a nuisance. The baked enamel finish makes for easy cleaning, but for the money, I now use a ""Coleman's Propane Powerpack Perfectflow"" burner. It is a much better piece of camping equipment. Coleman is the best by far."
2,beware of sudden propane expulsion,"I bought this stove last year for camping with our paddling club. I had used it only a handful of times when I screwed it together 9/30/06 in preparation for heating my dinner. After hearing a sudden pop and spewing, I discovered the stove was expelling all the contents of the attached propane cylinder through a tiny hole next to the screw-in valve. Another propane cylinder produced the same result. When I tried to plug the tiny hole with a matchstick, it quickly blew out the plug and continued to gush. I have contacted the company, who claim the product is warranted for five years."
1,"UNSAFE TO USE, TIPS OVER!!!","LOOKS OK IN THE BOX BUT WHEN ASSEMBLED WITH A PROPANE BOTTLE THE WHOLE UNIT TIPS OVER TOWARD THE BOTTLE. SOMETHING IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE BOTTLE. I TRIED MOVING THE SLIDING PLASTIC FEET TO THE SIDE TOWARD THE BOTTLE, BUT IT STILL TIPPED OVER WITH NOTING ON THE BURNER. VERY POORLY DESIGNED. SPEND A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS AND BUY A BRAND NAME."
1,Piece of junk...,"This is the first thing I have ever had to return to Amazon. I was really surprised that it had a QA sticker on it... there was no possible way that it should have passed inspection. Nothing was aligned properly during manufacturing, making it impossible to put it together.I bought this originally for backup cooking for when the power when out. The whole product was made of very thin metal and looked as if it would burn up in just a few uses. I was VERY disappointed. As I said... a piece of junk."
3,"Cheap, but shows it...","I bought one of these single-burner stoves to take on campouts and it has worked well most of the time. But the cheap price leads to some drawbacks: The knob came off after about the 6th campout (but was easily replaced from an electronics parts retailer); there's no carrying case and the cardboard box came apart after just a couple of trips; the wind screen/pot supports scratch the base when you install them, which leads to rust over time; the wind screen and fuel tank connector kind of fits inside the base, but not really, which makes it a bit awkward to pack up and carry. But, for the price, it works reasonably well."
3,Unstable,Burner is unstable with out a pot or pan on it. the feet need to be improved so that it does not try to tip over when the cooking utensil is removed from the burner
5,Realistic and Fun!,"This is a good quality toy. It looks like a real castle, not a fantasy castle, and can be configured in different ways. Cleverly, Schleich made a couple of the narrow pieces with the inner ledge higher than the inner ledge on the wider wall pieces. This makes placing them as an angled corner piece possible. No gaps. The other walls slide together underneath. You can see it in one of the pictures, but you wouldn't know what a great trick it is. It means that the castle doesn't just have to be a rectangle or square. This castle can't be beat for a boy's imagination toy. My son loves it and plays with it almost every day. He has 6 soldiers and plenty of animals which can be placed in, on, and around the castle on the ledges, walkways, towers, etc. The drawbridge is awesome. I highly recommend this castle."
2,Not Very Sturdy,"The pieces do not attach together, they just stand up next to each other. As a result, the draw bridge base is not heavy enough to support pushing down on it to open and close the gate without it falling over. And since none of the pieces aside form the drawbridge do not attach in any way, my son is constantly knock over half the castle while he is trying to play with it. I am currently engineering a way to attach the pieces with hinges but I should not have to do this for a product this expensive. Very disappointing since this was his big xmas gift."
5,Best Castle for lots of Fun,"We bought this for Santa to bring to our almost 5yr old son for Christmas. He saw this in a catalog and it was all he wanted. My dad bought him several knights and horses to go with some he already had and got his 6yr old brother the tent and catapult. Not only have the two boys enjoyed playing with this non-stop but it has become the home for Star Wars figures as well (They said it looked like the sand planet).The detail is wonderful and it is designed well for different configurations - great for that imagination to work with!This is a super durable toy and I think well worth the money. Considering there are many other similar items out there that may be a little cheaper, but will never hold up as well. I can see this toy being something my sons save for their children. If you can, buy the knights and other pieces from Schleich that compliment this piece. They are equally durable and beautifully detailed."
4,Our boys love this!,"The castle itself is very sturdy, although we have had to fiddle with the drawbridge chain a few times {boys will be boys!}. Our boys {ages 5 and 7} have had a lot of fun playing castle with this ~ with legos, army men, or any action figure they can get their hands on. We've had ours for 2 years now and it is a solid toy that will be with us for years to come."
5,"Great product,","Schleich makes the most durable toys. I havn't seen this type of quality and attention to detail in toys in decades!! So it doesn't move or make noises, but I can tell you that there is nothing like watching my kids use their beautiful imagination and not have a blank stare at a screen while clicking buttons."
5,The Knights of Aidan's Round Table,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old for christmas. He loves playing Knights. It was bigger than I expected it to be. Schleich makes great products. Usually I would say this is for the older child but if you have one with an imagination who loves to play with figures this is a great addition. There are so many extra parts you can get to make the castle even bigger. Great buy!*very durable out side but do be careful with the floors that go in side in the turrets they are a little bit more flimsy than the rest of the product.
2,"{BUYER BEWARE} Should be called ""Segments of a Castle""","I am extremely disappointed in this Schleich purchase. The castle is not a solid unit, nor does it present the opportunity to be such. Every piece you see, stands independently. They do not interconnect. The individual pieces end up being: two towers, a drawbridge/entry, two side walls, two corner walls.The details are great and material durable, but my four year old is going to want function. I am going to want function without frustration. This castle will be a disappointment to us both come Christmas morning.We may keep and have a woodworker cut a board to match as a perfect base that we permanently secure all pieces to. Or, go back with the Melissa and Doug castle to save us money and additional work.I really wish I would have seen the other reviews re: the same details I find to be a serious downfall with this toy."
2,Wish I had never purchased,"My son has a castle that he loves and when his cousin comes over he plays all the time with the castle. For my nephew's pbithday I puchased him this castle. It is different from son's (his castle is one piece). I understood that this castle had different pieces and that it wasn't one piece. I did also think the pieces would be held together in some way - they aren't. Every time we get the castle set up the pieces fall over if you play with the castle.I am soo disappointed. This is one time where paying less money for a one piece castle would have been a much better bet.Now, after one month, the castle sits in its box unplayed with. The drawbridge connector also broke off and had to be glued."
2,Not very convenient...,"First I have to admit that I bought this for my 3 year old, so maybe we are out of our league and he will eventually grow into it. The fact that the pieces do not slide together or interlock at all really ticks him off. He barely plays with the castle at all honestly. Maybe something to grow into but for now, not worth the money. Maybe at some point we will have enough dedicated space to mount it to something but its a pretty large piece."
2,Durable but not imaginative,"This castle is very durable, but has no imagination. If I had to do it over, I would not. The cost of the castle is simply not worth the lack of pizzaz."
2,wrong product,"Amazon didn't send me the schleich castle!, they send me another one made of wood and completely different from the ""schleich"" one which is supposed to be plastic. I openned it when I was in Argentina because it was a present for my grandson and didnt open the box in the States, so I cannot return it by now. I'm very dissapointed! The one I now have is fun but you have to put all the parts together every time the kid plays..."
4,Knights Castle,"This castle is HUGE! I read that it was large but it really is impressive. When set up it's about 3' wide and 1.5' tall. The set is beautiful and very durable. I see my four year old enjoying this castle for many years to come. The biggest negative attribute this castle has is that the sections (ie, towers, walls, drawbridge, etc) do not connect, they just stand up next to eachother. There are also 2 ""landings"" in each tower that come out easily (not as easy to replace). The drawbridge works great but it has a base that is not connected either. In general it's a beautiful castle that seems very durable with many years of play, however, it does take a little time to set up after our 2 year old finishes his seige but it's worth the imaginative play they get out of it. For the deal we got I'd do it again."
1,Why is there alarm on this thing?,"I took four stars off because I just do not like other programming options on the stopwatch like setting an alarm, having time display on it, and just having the thing to constantly be on. As a key-chain item it gets all programmed by itself when you have it in your pocket and I find it a hassle every time I take it out to just get out of the programming mode into a stopwatch mode. It's also very annoying when the alarm starts beeping after it gets programmed in the pocket.Why not just make a durable key chain stopwatch without any other additions? I have not met anyone who wakes up to an alarm off their key-chain..."
3,KEYCHAIN STOPWATCH,"IT WORKS FINE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY ADDED FEATURES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE. BUT DO LIKE THE SMALL SIZE."
1,terrible product,"This product was a huge disappiontment. It broke after only one month. You might as well buy cheap ones, they'd probably last longer."
2,Not what I expected,"The description ""multifunction"" made it sound like the thermometer would be part of the digital display. In fact it's a little glue-on spring thermometer on the back - and the picture only shows the compass on the front. Very disappointing."
4,To the point and an enjoyable read/ referance,"Doug shows us how we can get involved with electric boating for about $500 and 60 hours investment! This is the third book about electric boating I have read, and I expect it will be the last. Doug covers it all and leaves the reader with enough flexability to suit their needs."
1,An electrical engineering disaster.,"This book is an excellent primer on the joys of low impact boating but tends toward science fiction when discussing the physics of electric motors and the batteries that power them. Table 3-1, for example, is a good example of power calculations gone seriously wrong, and serves more to disinform and confuse the reader than explain the true relationships between motor voltages, current draw and thrust. The author's discussion of the calculations in the tables exposes his lack of fundamental understanding even further. Enjoy the book for the nice pictures and descriptions of boats suitable for electric power, but go elsewhere if you wish to understand how the whole system works."
4,An erotic cartoon .....,"Ray Gordon in his growing versatility must have had fun writing this book ... and it IS crazy ......Defrocked Father Entercock living near Cumsdale school for young girls finds himself alone for two weeks while his girlfriend, and ex KGB agent working in Londos must travel to the USA for a work contract. Although the nasty old bishop and the mother superior managed to have Entercock defrocked he did get to continue living in the rectory practicall on school grounds ...Crazy crazy crazy ... what more can I say"
3,Wild and crazy seems more like a literary cartoon,The story deals with a young priest who manages to keep start a bootleg alcohol and ciggarette black market out of the basement of his church while he defiles every young woman that comes near him or his church ...Needless to say he also has access to a convent of young girls and the Bishop and Mother Superior are having trouble catching father William in the act .. so to say ..The stry requires absolutely no intelligence on the part of the readr and thats the only reason I gave it 3 stars .....
4,Gripping page turner,"Hecht is an entertaining, intriguing writer. This is his second novel I have read (Skull Session is the first). He delves into interesting topics that create psychological thrillers. This book, in addition to being a book I couldn't put down, focuses on deeply philosophical and even spiritual issues that strike the heart of human behavior and responsibility.The only shortcoming in this book is the role of a religious-zealot-wacko who plays a prominent part. Although probably a realistic type of character, I just was not able to logically connect his mission and what would motivate him to kidnap a scientist. It seems incongruent that such a zealot would ever consider little knows scientific evidence to actually threaten his empire of mind numb followers.Otherwise, the characters are interesting and the story creative and intelligent. If you like this, I recommend Skull Session too."
2,Good idea and some new words,"Just could not get to liking this book despite the fascinating premise of a scientific cause of violence. Would have liked more of a plot line and more sympathetic characters rather than the sense of being lectured to, which at times was distracting. Plus the annoying habit of creating words really drove me crazy (but kept my attention looking for new ones) such as perseveration (not perseverance?), predacious (had to look it up, but predatory would have worked) and other 50 cent words that reinforced the feeling of textbook rather than recreational reading. All in all, would try this author again with another intriguing theme (if he maintains his perseveration)."
2,Promising but lets you down,"How promising: intelectually interesting topic, well researched, catching start and the craftmanshift of the author of ""Skull session"". What a let down to find that in between the good writing and excellent parts there simply is no good plot and the characters remain as flat as soap actors. Daniel Hecht can do better and I hope his next book will prove that."
1,Very disappointing,"Simply the worst book I have ever read. I read the jacket cover and was immediately interested in the subject matter. However, the development, interaction and dialogue of two main characters were totally unrealistic and unbelieveable to me. This may be someone's cup of tea, but it didn't do anything for me. It was a struggle just to finish it. I gave it a one for the subject matter."
2,Too pricey for the fragility of charms,I initially purchased 2 boxes for party favors and Ihad to purchase another as two were broken upon arrival& one broke while taking it out of the package. Thethird box arrived w/a broken one & one breaking asit was being taken out of the box.That is 5 broken out of 18!Which equals approx. $20 wasted so far!Not holding out much hope for the survival of the othersonce they are being used.
4,good!,it is super hydrous! feels smoothly although I did not observe any changes to my dry fine lines yet ..
1,returned item,The set was delivered with bits missing. very disappointed in the set but had a great return experience. I returned it to Amazon with no trouble.
1,"Douglas is a Dick Marcinko wanna-be, give Seals a bad Name.",I could not believe what a trash this book was. From the start it looked like he was rewriting a Rougue Warrior book but making it more unrealistic. Every few sentences we heard a description of the same weapons over and over again. The scenario was so bad that it made me laugh. I'll never read one of his books again.

3,POOR EDITING BUT ACTION PACKED,"Firestorm seemed to have more editing errors than any of Keith's prior novels. Almost every chapter had ""the"" instead of ""they"". But if you can look past the poor grammar the story is full of covert action with our Seals taking some hits from the Chinese. Thriller to the end."
2,old and weathered,"Not in such hot shape at all. Crinkled cover and dog-eared. I knew it would be ""new"", but expected better for the price."
5,Apocalypse: Biblical Revelation Explained - Catholic Teaching,"I think this is the most informative simple to understand explanations of the Book of Revelations that I have ever read. It explains Revelations from the Catholic teachings and shows you where the ""666"" mark of the beast is from. I highly recommend it to anyone. I have given several copies to my friends."
3,Good Shopping item,"It is a very good choice for exercise and when the weather is getting cool, I definitely recommend this product."
5,thick,"nice and thick , the size was just as should be,, if you wear an xl order xl ,, i hate when sizing is off, old navy,, target,, they dont know an xl from a med."
4,nice hoodie,"when i recived this package i was pretty happy, the sweatshirt wasnt to heavy but also wasnt to thin. was good for fall and spring weather. inside is very comfortable."
3,Good value for money but sheds fluff,"This is a pleasantly comfortable ""thin"" hoodie. Great for chilly evenings and mornings without feeling like overkill. But I wouldn't recommend it for protection against colder temperatures. It is good value for money (my medium size in black came to about $20. But the hoodie has a fluffy inner lining (not sure what the material or technical term for it is) that it sheds, making for messy wearing."
5,Very Warm!,"Bought this for my husband he loves hoodies but not the bright colors he likes darker shades he loves these hoodies I had to get him one in BLK! Now he has Choc, White, Dark sky blue, Charcoal, Old gold he's fav, 49er color gold lol , Orange for SF gaints lol, Black, Navy !Every man needs a Hoodie!"
3,"Great Fit (for me) but ""Best Hood"" is a misnomer","I'm short and stocky, but the XL fits me perfectly. The ribbing at the waist is gathered really nicely, so it doesn't hang sloppily. I would have given the sweatshirt 5 stars except it is somewhat lightweight; the hood is not lined; and it's a little snug around the neck area. I suppose I'm also reacting to the name, ""Best Hood."""
3,White hoody,"fits a little weird but it is good quality for the amount of money i payed. i usually wear small or medium so i ordered a medium and it fits, but its a weird shape"
3,Hoodie:,"I was disappointed that it was not a heavier weight like 10oz to 12oz, should have looked closer at the 8oz rating."
3,Slip and slide,"This product is smaller than I expected. The real problem is that it sometimes will not hold tight in the miter slot, and it's only made for miter slots, not T-track or other hold down methods. And what is the metal strip/tongue for (OK, it's supposed to be a hold down)? Even something this simple needs an instruction sheet I guess. The last time I tried to use this it slipped again. I lightly lubed the tapered face of the clamp screw, and it worked fine, so maybe there is some hope."
2,Screen Scratcher!,"Great idea, but it needs some improving upon. I kept the plastic protective seal on my replacement 7100t while waiting for SkinTight to arrive. One day after putting it on, the screen of the BB and the screen protector has scratched each other. This pretty much defeated the purpose. They need to redesign the screen protector so it does not rub on the screen.I got less scratches carrying my first one in my pocket for a year than I have gotten with this in one week!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I can not believe that CBS is still trying to make money off this crap. If the show was so terrible that it couldn't finish one season on basic cable, what makes you think it is good enough to own. This is a watered-down pathetic version of the movie. If you can't get all the original charecters, then you shouldn't even try. The Sex and the City guy is not the husband in this show. BOO! Don't pay for something that you didn't watch when it was free on TV. Very Bad."
1,zero stars if I could,"What a huge stinking pile this show was. Don't bother with this release, just don't bother. If you get this as a gift from a friend, that person is not your friend and has no taste."
5,"Big, Fat still Funny","I rented the dvd last night and I'm glad I did. I laughed hardand even watched some episodes twice. Constantine shines again and so does the rest of the cast. Brilliant acting, they seem to enjoy it. I don't know why the show was cancelled or why some people don't understand the difference between movie and sitcom. The writers also deserve credit cause they really did capture the spirit of being Greek and presented Greek life as it really is. So don't be a xeno to a good sense of humour. Rent/buy this dvd."
5,Sooooooo Funny!,"I thought this series was great! It tool a few episodes not to long for John Corbett's pretty face, but once you get over it, you realize how great this show is! Not sure why it was pulled becasue there are so many sitcoms that are so horrible that have been on for awhile. Nia and the rest of the cast are great. That's why I am buying this DVD! Nia, PLEASE make a sequel to MBFGW! I swear, it's my life too-even the crazy yaya! Enjoy!"
4,It's a shame they didn't give it a chance!,I think it's a real shame they ended this so quickly. It wasn't given enough of a chance to reach its potential! I thought that it would have been a great series.
5,Highly Recommended,"I don't purchase a lot of TV series, but this was one that I am glad I did. While quite different from the movie(part of the husband is a totally different actor than the movie)I found it to be fantastic and I was very surprised that it didn't have another season or at least more episodes. I would recommend this disc as a great companion to the movie."
1,"Stay far, far away.","I made it through about 6, maybe 7 minutes of this truly horrendous tripe. I suppose the saddest thing to see was improv veteran Andrea Martin, who apparently is not familiar with the difference between character and caricature, and is simply excruciating. Save what neurons you have and stay far, far away from this awful mess."
1,Absolutely awful,"This is one of the worst works on Renaissance combat ever written. It is rife with inacuracies. The author creates bizzare theories about the subject, and then ignores all evidence from original sources that contradict his theories. It is unfortunate that this work is still in print - it provides the reader with far more information that is wrong than that is correct. Unfortunately, without serious research, it is impossible for a casual reader to tell which is which. Avoid this book like the plague."
1,Bah.,"Don't bother. It tried to fill what was a bit of what was a whole in our scholarly reconstruction of martial arts for a while, but it failed... and there are better things available now anyway. Check out the offerings at Chivalry Bookshelf instead."
2,Rapiers and Ridicule,"John Clements's articles usually show an interesting mix of real knowledge, opinion expressed as proven fact, and ridicule of anyone who would ever presume to disagree with him. This book is no exception. He has the ONE TRUE WAY, and he will tell you at extreme length why any other opinion is not merely wrong, but proof of the other person's ignorance, delusions, etc. (I can hardly repeat all of his insults.)If you can stomach the insulting tone, there is some useful knowledge here. But you must supply all the judgement about the limits of his understanding or about any other possible opinions - he provides none."
4,Piercing through nonsense and fantasy,A splendidly detailed and ilustrated work of great detail. It provided vast informative knowledge that wil benefit any serious martial artist or fencer intersted in the real ways of european fighting in the renaissance. Not just another stage combat view on dressing up and acting out your fanatsies. This is a impressive book for real swordsmen not would be-Zorro's and musketeers. The weapon details were the most enjoyable.
2,A sincere but flawed work.,"Mr. Clements book makes an attempt to be a primer for sparring in the renaisance style. Unfortunatly it is marred by some serious flaws. Poor scholarship leads to some misleading, and occationaly bizzare, statements about the practice of swordplay in the period he covers. People who are new to the subject are likely to walk away from his book with some odd ideas. The books strength is in its well developed diagrams and grounding in sparring practice. In this area though Clements skimps on the amount of material. There seems to be no end to his misleading preface, notes, introductions, and mini essays; but there is fairly little of what he does well. The middle third of his relativly brief book is all he devotes to the practice of swordplay. All in all I cannot really recomend this book to anyone, the neophyte will leave worse informed than when he started and there isn't enough solid technical information for those interested in the sparring."
1,Run Away!,I have nothing good to say about this work. There are much better works for learning renaissance sword work. Run don't walk away from this one.
1,"Terribly, terribly dated","When this came out it was one of the few book of its kind and represented the majority opinion. Within a few short years of publication, however, it was clear how much of it was flat out wrong (Hint: Almost all). It should be long out of print and relegated to the, ""Ah, we were young and foolish once,"" shelves. The fact that it is not is a sad indictment of the author."
4,good basic book to clear the misconceptions,"I like the clarity of the pictures in the work. They provide a good 3-D like picture of what is going on for each technique. I like how the author takes great pains to clear up many myths about swords and sword-fighting that many stagecombat people like to foster in others to hide the fact that they themselves learned how to use a sword by taking sport fencing or watching Spartacus. If you want to learn how to use a rapier or cut and thrust sword, then this book is for you. The author shows you most all basic techniques in a clear format in such a way that you will be able to apply what you learn and create your own personal style."
3,A patchy review of Renissance swordsmanship,A book that could have benifited from a good editor. Clements provides good drawings and some training methods which make the reader want to pickup a sword. Unfortunetly Clements literature review and disconected discussions also leave the reader with a bit of a headache. The bibliography provides a good starting point for further independant research.
4,excellent for history buffs and recreationists,"I work at a fencing school and have seen it all. John Celements study on the art of the rapier has opened new doors not onlt to me, but to the students of the school. All the questions that start as ""How did they.."" are answered here."
5,A book that defies common thought!,"This book is for anyone who is not afraid to question his or her own beliefs in the often hotly debated arena of swordsmanship. From hours and hours of practice and research Clements is able to separate historical fact from fiction. This book though small in size is able to demonstrate the basics of a simple killing cut to advanced tactics with sword and dagger. Attacks to the leg, face and, body are shown that would make anyone cringe in pain. Few other people can offer this insight with such absolute credibility. Historical drawings and an incredible list of references round out his writings to show that his work is based exclusively in fact. This book introduces the work of Masters who have dedicated their lives to the study of fence and killed with this knowledge."
1,Not for the serious student of fencing.,"The reality challenged will love this book. But, in truth, John Clement's self-important volume is not for anyone serious about reality. It is primarily for self-taught ""swordsmen,"" those individuals who like to dress up in historical costumes and pretend they really know something about fighting with swords. Mr. Clements comes across with a certain arrogance, as someone who believes he has a monopoly on genuine sword fighting skills and knowledge. Be wary of those who pat themselves on the back. As a fencing master of some years, I do not recommend Mr. Clement's book except as a novelty."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book after I attended some rapier seminars around the USA. I was hoping to get some further insights into the techniques I had learned about, but to my disappointment not even the basics are mentioned by Clements. I mean, not even the four hand positions... that basic! Also no explanation of the engagement, the disengage, time and measure... nothing.Clements comes across as a modern person writing about a weapon he is unfamiliar with and that he uses as he would use a baseball bat or a sharp stick. There may be some sound streetsmart advice for a casual practitioner, but little or no historical information. Also did not appreciate the many digs at the SCA, although I don't belong, and theatrical fencers, which I am not one. Save your money and go to a seminar, you'll learn a lot more."
5,Response to technical critique,"After reading some customers comments about the difficulty with the first run of the DVD, I called my distributor Terra Entertainment. Carlos Solorio assured me that they have reprogrammed the DVD to include a menu portion so that customers can easily navigate the material. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and if you would like a replacement copy of the DVD, please email me personally and I get you one. In additon, all DVD's have a language selection of English or Chinese. If your DVD does not give you a choice, please contact Terra Entertainment or the place you bought the product from to replace it. We will be adding Spanish and French, hopefully in the next year.Sincerely,Linda Modarolindamodaro@earthlink.net"
3,Great at home exercise cd,"Linda Modaro is a great teacher and I enjoy the way she explains the ""Chi"" movement and activations. The exercises are easy to follow and the information is clear. The video is a bit outdated and still good."
5,"wonderful guidance, lots packed into this set.","very impressed with this training dvd, finding it quite helpful. multiple layers of guidance for the first disc, which is as far as I have gotten for now. First step guides you through detailed guidance, with ability to choose specific movement to learn or review. This stage focuses primarily on learning the physical movements. Then next phase is the flow of the exercises where Linda begins to share what to focus on while doing the exercises. also gives more info about purpose of the movements. Finding it very beneficial introduction into Qi Qong."
3,I don't generally write reviews...,"I was curious about this set and bought it on a whim as it seemed to be a good value. It is very calm, relaxing, and in my opinion out of date. It is very obvious this is transferred from VHS to DVD format and the only other review on this item is by the creator. I found it to be very boring and slow paced. Extremely drawn out and I really don't have much motivation or interest to even attempt to practice this or learn this from this DVD."
2,dissapointing,"I was really dissapointed with this book. I have one tattoo and have been trying to design a few more, based on Celtic Art. I bought this book with the intention that it would give a broad array of spiral, circular, and knotwork designs that I could use for inspiration, or even just copy to use.What I got was a 70 page ""book"" that looks more like a pamphlet, with about 15 pages total of designs....most of them very common that I've already seen and could have gotten off a cheap internet site.Not to mention that they are all very small, in black and white, and not clear detail.There is some useful information on how to draw your own knotwork, which I might use...but I'm going to have to buy another book to get what I want. I should have spent my money elsewhere, and you should too."
2,Don't be disappointed,"This was written as the 3,000 word booklet to accompany the Celtic Tattoo Gift Pack, and as such wasn't aimed at serious tattooists. The aim was to give an idea of the 'look and feel' of celtic art, though trying to do that without any colour seems to miss most of the beauty. The lack of colour or even any celtic art on the cover should be a giveaway.If the idea of celtic tattoo transfers interests you have a look at the Celtic Tattoo Pack here at amazon.If you're a serious tattoo artist buy George Bain's 'Celtic Art', the classic bible on the subject and explore the web for the modern variations.I was given 3 weeks to write and draw this booklet and don't get royalties, so can honestly say that you can do better than this - I did."
2,Unfortunate Purchase...,"I am in the process of going to a Celtic tattoo specialist @ Lucky Fish Tattoo in Santa Barbara, CA. I have 1 celtic tattoo, 10 total tattoos and in a month will have a custom celtic tattoo done. I have been waiting to get this book for a bazillion months and when I finally did I found it to be the biggest waste of time. I never imagined with the great subject matter that a book could be more insignifigant. The designs lack uniqueness in the book, there are few, and they also lack the detail of the meaning. This book trys to take the beautiful and amazing art of tattooing celtic design and verbalize it and use black and white pictures. Wasted $$ and time."
2,So so,"I love celtic tattoos, and I was expecting a book written on the celtic tattoos you find on the people this days. On the other hand, it talks about the tattoos the Kells made on themselves, and not really in a historical way, but in a estetical way (how they look, and what were the variations of their tattoos a thousand years ago). Honestly, it's good paper, but not much printed on it, and the best tattoo you'll see on the book is on the front page."
3,"Good, not great.","This 1992 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fantastic book, ""The Lost World,"" is good but falls shy of being great. John Rhys-Davies is perfect for the role of Professor Challenger and David Warner is equally matched to the role of Professor Summerlee, but this story really calls for a much larger budget and a director that can handle the humor, and more importantly, the intense dramatic elements of Doyle's work with an eye for realism and believability."
5,GREAT MOVIE !,"this is a great movie!loved it.i like the t.rex just like in the sequel.(see my review)there were no negative reviewers but there was a 3-star reviewer. i dont know what his problem was with the ''proper remake'' because it was,is a proper remake. somepeople go to a some place,meet dinos, and aren't proud of it.just like the sequel. well thats my review,like it or not."
2,The Lost World w/John Rhys Davies,"This video comes in a tin box, which is fine. The main problem I had with this was that there was a third ""freebie"" DVD in this tin box package. This third DVD was horrible and I can see why they were giving it away. The overall story for The Lost World was OK, and I guess I was just expecting it to be as GOOD as the TV series. The general story was OK, it could have been developed better, that's all. Keep trying. Thanks, Gail"
3,"Very nice, but can't they do a proper re-make?","It's unbelievable that, in this age of CGI and other such special effects and technology, th 1925 silent black-and-white version of Conan Doyle's masterpiece is still the best version. That said, this version starts off very promisingly and there is some excellent acting, though Challenger comes across as far too soft and nothing like the fearsome figure he was in the book. And whre is Roxton? Presumably a big-game hunter wouldn't be very nice. Everything in this film is 'nice'. What realy lets the film down, however, are the cheap, unconvincing dinosaurs. There's on good sequence near a lake but otherwise it's all pretty pathetic. There are hardly any dinosaurs actualy in it, the tyrannosaur only ever visible from the waist upwards and seemingly frozen on the spot. This film has its good moments, but it's really just another might-have-been. It only gets three stars because it's better than that dire 1960 version."
4,Ok Remake,"This remake of the 1925 classic is not as bad as some made it to be,its well worth the money if your a fan of dinosaurs"
3,Not as good for second year graduate students,It is a good book for beginners but not as great for graduate students.
1,What a gyp!!,"Again, not a new book, just a repackaging of her old ones. Getting tired of retreads from her."
1,Repeats/condense/re-releases,"The only time a 2-in-1 re-release book helps anyone is for those people who stumble across the author whose style they really like and decide they want to read everything they have published. They save money. Good for them. It may also help those who want to read something by that author that is no longer in print. I think that is the only good reason to ""re-release"" a title. I love Christine Feehan's work and she is not the only author I really like that does this. It's frustrating because you think ""Oh boy, a new book by so and so"" then crash! Also,I really dislike when authors re-release a title with ""a few added revisions"". The book is ages old and after you've bought it with new cover, etc you start reading to find its ""old"". I've really had to start watching those first print dates. Thank you for allowing to to blow off steam with regards to this subject."
5,awesome,The leopard people books are really cool because they can shape-shift into animals and the book fever has two books in one
3,"book, Fever",I was dissapointed that there were two books and one and I had already read one of them.
1,Satisfaction,Item was as described and promised. I was completely satisfied with this item.Janet H. Huber
3,Meow,"I really loved te dark series, but this one didn't do it for me. The sex scenes happened too soon, without developping the story."
3,Book. Fever by Christine Feehan. Leopard breed.,The book was ok. I wish there was more to the story. Too much time was spent on how they felt about each other and the sex did not really flow with the story. It was like the book was written about them having sex and the story line was just put in here and there.
4,Loved This Item,This author expresses so much of our times today and surely of those yesterday. I appreciate and love the way the author presented it. There is so much for a young adult to relate. I am so glad I came across the item and look forward to the next book from this author.
2,Size matters,I rodered this shoe in a 5.5w BIG GIRL and recieved and baby shoe the shoes looks like picture defintely and im sure you have seen it before however i was not able to return and get proper size at deal price.
4,A MUST READ,"i found this 'trip' with Mr. Roe thoroughly enjoyable. It was humorous, encouraging,informative and lots of fun. It is difficult to realize this is non fiction.."
3,Not the original text,"This book is meant for people who are learning Spanish. It contains a vocabulary and review questions (quizzes) at the end of each chapter. If you are looking for the original text, don't buy this book. This is only an edited version, sort of children's talk."
5,Watch,Great watch for the price! You can't really see what time it is in the dark. The glow-in-the-dark things don't work very well.
1,No. No. No. Athousand times No.,"Like every Kategeek I am always on the hunt for new and rare items to add to the already bloated K8T collection.Be warned if you are anything like me you will be VERRY disapointed.This is a book report of an audio cd with no Bush music,only a friendly enough voice telling you everything you already know with new age music in the backround.If you are a US Kate fan you would be better off using the money you could have spent on this disapointment an buy the UK version of Never Forever(The US version has the first bar of Babooshka cut out of it.)"
4,"if you love kate's music, you will appreciate this","this was worth checking out - it was fascinating and very satisfying.i discovered a few things i didn't already know.there is still as much mystery now as before, because there are new questions.it might be better if things remained mysterious.her music is always such a joy in my life, and the beautiful woman who makes it is always interesting."
1,Poor Quality - Very thin - Rusting after washing,"Very poor quality Teaspoons, extremely thin. I did not return because I thought, OK there thin but if they do the job that's fine since they were a good deal. After a few washes they are getting little rust spots! Gross, I specifically ordered these for my son to eat his cereal with! Since he's only 5 all of my spoons end up in the trash when he cleans up by himself. I wish there was a review when I ordered these! Be warned people, you'd probably get better quality from the dollar store!"
5,A Big Help,This book is a huge help to game developers. I found it a great read while writing my first game engine. It covers so much stuff it makes you want to try and add it all to your game! I am really happy with this book.
5,healing ministries,"good resource for anyone serving in the church - lay ministries, healing ministries, disability ministries, etc. Very good arguments for discussion. Good reference to have in your library."
4,I admire this book.,"I think it's really great that Ruth Heller introduces a complex subject in a children's book without talking down to the children. It's great that she uses ""big"" words like ""oviparous""--kids, after all, can remember lengthy dinosaur names; there's no reason why they can't handle other long scientific words.But I do have slight qualms. For instance, the part about amphibians says that amphibians don't have claws--what about African clawed frogs?The illustrations are engaging, and the use of rhyme in prose makes the text flow nicely. The subject is interesting, too. I just wonder a bit about the accuracy of the ""facts"" presented here."
4,The Plum Plum Pickers,"""The Plum Plum Pickers"" Is about the life of an immmigrant worker in which poverty becomes a cycle caused by cold weather. The family becoming dependent on immensely low salary in which it makes Mr. Turner believe that he was helping the immigrant workers by employing and abusing them . Yet, misery was the greatest factor and was shared by all social classes. The immigrant workers misery was caused by not having the simply necessities of life (food and water). ""The Plum Plum Pickers"" is definitely one novel in which I believe everyone who lives in the United States must read."
1,no good,was eaten by the worm gear on about the 15th slice of a bottom round for making beef jerky. not sure if gear or metal worm is the problem.
5,2nd to pikes m&d,"this book gives one insight of the s.r. rituals,and is an excellant teaching companion along with pikes legendary writings on the s.r. side of freemasonry"
3,not his best!,"I hate to say critical things about one of my favorite California historians, but you're better off with any of his other books. This, written as a kind of memoir, spends more time on historical events in the US than it does on Carey. Another problem is his recurrent pointing out of how he foresaw certain events and was not surprised by others--it reads as though he feels he hasn't been given enough credit (which he hasn't) and must bring his foresightedness to the reader's attention. Maybe he was old and lonely when he wrote this, but in any case it's not of his usual calibre. Clearly written, though."
1,Useless,"This book is completely useless for someone learning western riding. It has detailed exercise description with no information about how to actually do them. For example, several pages are dedicated to walk-jog-walk exercises, with no description about how to get a horse to transition from a walk to a jog and from a jog to a walk.For the circle exercises the advice it to ""use your inside leg to activate the inside hind leg (I assume of the horse)"" -- but HOW?I learned nothing from this book and it was a complete waste of money."
5,great kit,very good kit. my child started to read right away very easily. She wants to read evryday without fail.
3,Interesting early on before fading...,"I found the first 25-30 pages interesting and enlightening, then gradually lost interest, although there are some bright spots on pages 30-334. Don't get me wrong, it's worth reading, but it gets somewhat tedious as you move through the book."
1,Not Really,"I came across this book as I find my name mentioned in a paragraph which says I became ""wealthy"" from managing a bbs forum on Prodigy. No, not really. No, not at all. No. Not even remotely. Not even, well off. Really offensive such a bald error.So, judging from the misinformation about me....wonder about the book.But, we all make mistakes?"
1,a well written book about a worthless topic,"It did not meet my expectations which were so built up by every english teacher. For a teenager, this was a boring book about upper class society from a past generation and had little value that could be absorbed by a hopeful reader"
3,beautifully done but regretfully with a tasteless boring script,"the cinematography is poetically great, but the storyline is a little bit contrite and boring that would need constantly revival of your mental condition to avoid falling into the zzzland. a movie you'd better start watching either you are not too tired or too sleepy, otherwise, you might not comprehend what's going on. the colors of the settings are so beautiful, but without a strong storyline, it's no better than watching pbs programs. ""The Sea Is Watching most likely wouldn't have made it to New York if not for the Kurosawa connection. That link is also the main reason to see it."" well said by a critic. also, like some other critics said: this movie is 'an undistinguished affair' and 'more a framed tribute than an involving experience'. both are quite true ."
3,Academic biography,"Those who are not looking for an academic biography should check out Adam Smith: The Man and His Works by E. G. West. It's concise, elegantly written, and keenly insightful. Only specialists and academics need bother with Ross's tome."
3,Man I wish someone would review this item,"If you go to the RCA web site it says nothing about the following features. ------- Composite Video OutputComposite video output allows you to display video images on your TV set.------Audio and Video Recording ModeRecords from analog input source to mp3 format. Records from analog video input to MPEG-4 format.------Compact Flash (Type 1) SlotTransfers audio, video or any file type to HDD. View pictures directly from digital camera's compact flash card.I hope it has all of these fetures because I think I'm buying it. Even without them it looks like a great player. Somebody please write a review on this product."
2,Battery Life a Disappointment,"Purchased 2 of these. Price was right, capacity for music great, fairly painless setup and transfer. BUT- After several months of play, battery barely lasts 10 mins after a full charge."
2,Not for audiobooks,"Works fine as a music player but didn't perform the function for which it was purchased: to play downloaded audiobooks. At least in Massachusetts, audiobooks are downloaded from libraries as single files of up to 150 mb. However, this player lacks a ""bookmarking"" feature so you cannot listen to 10 pages worth, stop the player, and pick up where you left off the next day."
1,"5 Stars, only if...","This unit is quite nice to operate, software is good. But when the battery gets low, there is no warning before the unit just freezes with backlight on; you can't turn it off, you can't charge it, you can only wait...days...until the battery finally dies from drawing power to the backlight, then it can be recharged. If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars. But alas, it gets just 1 star due to that, and a return for refund."
2,Customer Service is a misnomer,"I hope you like this product because you will grow old waiting for customer service to do anything about it.We purchased the LYRA 2765 on January 2, 2006. It would not hold a charge. After several calls to the RCA/Thomson Customer Service department, I was given a Return Authorization #. I returned the player on January 20. After several more phone calls, I was told on March 2 they could not ship a replacement and would refund my money. I have since faxed them 3 times with copies of receipts etc. and made several more phone calls. (Bring a cup of coffee to the phone when you call Thomsons Cust. Service, because each phone call to Thomson requires a 20-40 minute hold.) On April 13, I was told the refund was being processed. On May 22, when I tried to call, I was told the wait time would be from 30-60 minutes."
1,it...,"personally i think that this thing is a great mp3 player if you intend to only have it for a few months, i've had mine for 3 months today, and so far the only thing that i've found is that is, wheel used for ajusting the volume sucks! and then eventually the little joystick will stop working and it is very hard to keep clean. It is currently in the process of being sent to the manufacturer so that i can be fully refunded my money."
5,Fun glow in the dark stars!,These glow in the dark stars are big and bright! I bought this for my kids as a reward for good behavior and the loved them too. Be sure to use adequate stick-em for each star otherwise they wall fall off the ceiling. If you run out of stick-em material then be sure to get white replacement material. Other colors show through the plastic.
4,Great for the price!,"Works well, glowing in the dark after only a few minutes of light. The box has a bunch of stars. I used it to line about a width of a foot from the ceiling, on two walls in my sons room. There are a bunch of smaller stars about 1 cm in diameter that are useless to put up that high since the glow is ineffective from so small a size. But the larger stars and planets work well at that height. I only gave it 4 stars because of about 1/4 of the stars were the small ones that you can hardly see if using high up close to the ceiling."
2,Star Stickers,"Very disappointed that most of the package were glow in the dark circles and stars stickers. I have small hands and I had a difficult time removing them from the backing or trying to stick them where you wanted them. I used the product, but it was not what I thought I was getting. The stars did hold the glow in the dark feature well."
2,Disappointed,"The stars may be really nice, but the package I received looked already open. The 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars."
1,Buy glo in dark paint,"If you have a popcorn ceiling, these stars are a nightmare. Bought glo in dark paint. MUCH EASIER!!"
2,Stars for walls,Overall an alright product. Too many little stars and not enough big stars. More sticky tack would be appreciated.
1,"No educational value, and they fall off","My kid and I put them on the ceiling and he asked me ""how are stars made?"" I don't really know how they are made but this activity of putting them up on the ceiling explained nothing to me about how stars are made, what they do, how big they are or even their true shape (stars don't really look like that shape, have you ever seen pictures of them?). Anyways, we got them up and then they started falling on the floor. I think there is one left up there. My kid asked me ""Dad, do stars fall to the ground like this?"" And I said, ""I don't know but if they are as cheap as these things then yeah they probably do."""
3,Don't stick too well,"There are a lot of items in this box and it takes quite awhile to put them up, but the effect is great. We did not have good luck with the sticky stuff provided and used scrap book glue dots instead, which worked a bit better. Our ceiling has some texture that makes them harder to stick on. If it was really flat, they would probably work ok. The plastic stars work well. The stickers are small and hard to get off the paper to stick on, but they do glow and look like distant stars."
5,Fun for kids,We were very happy with everything that came with this product. The stars all glow very bright.
4,Needs more adhesive,"I purchased this product to adhere to ceiling above my 4 year old's bed. The putty worked well but I ran out. I would recommend the product, but you really have to use a teeny amount of adhesive per star."
4,Plenty of stars,I purchased these for my sons' room. There were plenty of stars and galaxies. The glow a long time on little light and are a big hit.
3,"Not bad, does'nt glow long though.","Star Explosion is pretty cool, and you do get alot for the money, but they dont glow very long. You can leave the lights on in the room for hours, turn them off and the stars glow for about ten to fifteen minutes and thats it. If you use a black light they look great, but on there own, not so much."
4,Great,"I love the stars wish i bought another pack though. The stars that you use the putty were great the glow bright and the putty stuck well, The sticker stars that also come with it hardly glow and don't stay up. The stickers were also a pain, there were so many small ones, it took forever to get them up. I finally got them up and now its raining stickers every day."
1,Dont buy,Dont buy this its not worth the money. Doesn't glow like its supposed to. I am very upset. My daughter waited on this for her birthday and its junk.
3,No adhesive putty,"Well I was excited to receive these stars to decorate my sons room, once I finally receive the package thanks to USPS for some unknown reason being unable to deliver them to me (thats a whole other story of itself) I open the box to find low and behold no putty to put up the stars. Great. The stars are nice, some large some very very small but it is annoying that I can't put them up just yet until I go buy some putty."
4,Starry starry sky,"My little stargazer and I didn't follow the constellation instructions. While I think it would have been very cool to look up and see actual constellations, that would take just a bit more patience than either of us were really into devoting here. Instead we just staggered the different patterns around her ceiling, grouped particularly to the head of her bed. Turned off the light and got that great little kid ""Wooooooow!"" reaction that makes your heart glow. Followed by ""it's beauuutiful....""Unlike some, I actually like that some of the stars are actually stickers. The plastic shapes and the stickers have different depth, dimension, and glow. The stickers are almost universally smaller than the plastic shapes and have a bit more muted glow - so they look like they are somewhat farther away in the ""sky""."
4,be careful,"Only a portion of the total count are from plastic stars. The main count are a gazillion tiny ones printed on paper. However, still not a bad deal for the price, just buyer beware!"
5,Awesome!,Super Cool - easy to use and amazing when the sun sets.... The kids LOVED this gift! And there were soooo many stars.... Definitely one of the best lil' gift we ever gave the kids!
4,Good product for the price,"Received my shipment on time, and it was exactly what I expected. The only downfall is the amount of putty they give you. There is not enough putty for all of the stars. I will be buying more putty, but other than that, my son loves this, and it has also helped him sleep with the lights out because he wants to see the stars in his room. A couple of the stars fell the first day I put them up, but I reapplied them and they seem to be holding now."
4,"Not really a toy, but fun to decorate room with!","It is a box of plastic stars, and some adhesive putty. I got it because even though I am adult, I am young at heart and I will be re-painting my room, and the stars will be decorating the ceiling so I can fall asleep looking at constellations and learn them as I put them up. I guess if you have an older kid and want to ""play"" with them and put them up on their wall or ceiling it is a ""toy""; but I see it more as decorating art material. Overall, looks right for what I doing with it."
2,"Dull glow, falls off wall.","The glow doesn't last long enough. Also it takes forever to put them up with the enclosed putty. After being up there a week or 2, they start to fall off. I don't recommend."
4,Starry Eyed,"I purchased this item as a gift for a friend's children. The number and variety of celestial items is tremendous and the possibilities are out of this world. I was a little disapointed in the lack of stencils or serious guidance in creating actual constellations but other than that, this is a great value."
5,What a Deal!,"I have purchased Glow-in-the-Dark stars in my local stores in the past and was always disappointed in them. They would hardly glow to start with, and went dim in a couple of minutes. The sticky stuff to hold them to the wall was terrible, and a few would fall down every night.I bought these based on other reviews, and I couldn't be more impressed! You get tons of stars - so many it took me over an hour to put them all up. They glow very bright at first and continued to have a warm glow through most of the night. The sticky material works great.I can't recommend these enough - buy them and you'll be glad you did!Star Explosion Glow In The Dark"
2,the stars barely glow and the adhesive is terrible,"the stars glow for maybe 3 minutes after you shut the lights off, even after charging all day. they DO look nice while they are glowing.the amount of adhesive given would have worked fine if it was a much stronger adhesive......but they give you a VERY tiny amount and it does not hold up the bigger stars/galaxies well enough. they fall down.so i will be purchasing better adhesive.it does come with quite a lot of variety in shapes and sizes which was nice."
4,Fun for kids,"My girls really enjoy having these stars in their room. The only problem that I have with it, is that the puddy is not that stick for textured (not popcorn, but textured) ceilings. It falls off pretty quickly with them."
3,Misleading,The description didn't state that over half of the stars are just tiny stickers. I'm afraid to stick them to my wall for fear they won't come off easily.
1,Little Tiny Pieces That Don't Hold Their Glow,"This item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and I were very excited. I guess we should have read the description more carefully because I wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces. We used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room. We waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza. We kept the light on for some time to 'charge' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light. What we found was nothing close to amazing. The glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time. We even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but, again, the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes. I ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge. We dabbed stars all over his ceiling. These glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool."
2,Read this before ordering,"I'm sorry to say I've been duped, it's my fault but if you are the kind of person that reads Amazon reviews before ordering, this one may come in handy. I wanted a whole bunch of plastic glow stars for my daughters' room, I quickly read ""over 700 stars"", a brief description, and ordered. Most (over 500) of the so called stars are nail sized stickers, not actual plastic stars. I must be honest and say that when I re-read the description of the contents, they did mention it in the product page. The stars are ok, the product doesn't get more than two or max three stars as a review, most of them are fairly small anyways. I'm not saying not to order them, just read carefully. There are much better products in the market."
3,"Mostly TINY dot ""stars."" Wouldn't have purchased had seen box.","Had I seen the box I wouldn't have purchased this at this price. Included are 5 large stars, 45 small stars, 104 mini stars (which are TINY), 100 micro stars (VERY, VERY tiny), 20 astros, & 460 tiny glow-in-the-dark dot stickers. Many of the stars are just outline shapes which are kind of hard to put up. They also have a small amount of putty that can be used for about 20 stars at the most & a star map (a little booklet). The product iteslf is fine, but I was expecting more plastic stars, and I was expecting them to be the small stars rather than the mini & micro ones. The product is durable and my boys love the stars up in their bedroom. I'd say this is worth $10 rather than the $19 I paid for it."
1,Waste of Money and Misleading,"725 stars is the most misleading marketing ever. The majority of the stars are as big as your tumb nail. And two pages of itty bitty stickers makes up about 125 of the 725. Plus they give you about a 1x1 sqaure of putty to put up the things. Really maybe five dollars worth of product, not worth 15 dollars at all. Very dissapointed. Even the box is misleading. See the plastic circular part of it those are all the stars in the entire thing. Why have a box three times larger than the product?"
5,Maple jerky,My husband loves the flavor of maple bacon so thought this would make a great snack. He loved it. Has great sweet flavor not too mention how tender the cuts were. The 3.5oz bags are just the right size.
1,Hunting's Most Depressing Short Stories,"The odd assortment of stories in this book mostly portray hunters as cowards, braggarts, and boors---all caught up in dysfunctional relationships with their parents, children, friends, neighbors, and spouses. There are few classics here and some quality stories by budding authors, but there are many other mediocre ones that seem to have been selected only because of the negative light they throw on hunters and hunting. If you love hunting, you will be disappointed with this anthology."
1,"Vulgar , Obscene, Nothing to do with Hunting","Don't waste your time or money. A collection of vulgar, obscene short stories with catchy titles."
3,Not the color I was looking for,This did not match any of the pewter items I was painting by a long shot. It was a regular medium gray. This only means it doesn't match my items. However I would not call it pewter.
3,Takes a lot for full coverage,"The texture is good, but whatever your undercoat is, will be the main color of the finished product. I used a rust primer, thinking this should go on quickly and easily. Nope, a whole can gone in a few minutes and I could barely tell the difference. I suggest getting a flat base color (in my case I am needing a dark brown) that you want as your primary undercoat and then finish with the texture spray that is similar in color. I am off to walmart for a dark brown cheapo paint, as this stuff is way too expensive to use by itself."
2,spray paint,I did not think that the nickel color was exactly what I wanted. I invisioned nickel to be a different color than what it was. I did receive this in a short period.
2,size run small,"I bought this shoe but the size runs at least half size smaller. I have to bring it to the shoe repair store to stretch it. Also the bottom is hard, very uncomfortable."
5,Heats up a small space quickly,"We used this in the front part of our horse trailer, where we had a bed and dressing room, while camping. It heated up the small space quickly. Works great."
1,Product review,Would not recommend-bought for ice fishing shanty- installed propane tank - smelled gas leaking - figured out it was brass connectons tightened with wrenches got it to stop leaking - next day in shanty worked for a couple of hours then three to four inch open flame was coming out of where the heat is suppose to come from - burned my jacket sleeve before I saw it.I have a bic buddy which is awesome bought this one because of the price - will be buying another big buddy for next seasonI may try to return this one but if shipping is to much may just toss it out.
4,texsport propane heater,the heater does a great job heating my golf cart. It provides enough heat to be comfortible and cost efficient to operate. Good clean order free heat.
2,A little disappointing,"The product works fine, but I was under the impression that you could tilt the head upward and boil water on it, which would increase its utility. Nope, it's simply a heater, and not recommended for indoor (or in your camping tent)use due to carbon monoxide."
4,"Small space, propane heater","I was looking for a small space heater for our Camper Van so we could use it more often in the winter. I got to the Amazon site via Google. The reviews were very helpful turning me off some heaters and onto the one we purchased.The heater is quick, efficient and ideal for the small space we needed to heat.We camped out on New Year's Eve waking to 32 degrees on 1st January. The heater was perfect to start the day without frostbite."
4,Purchased for travel softball games,We have larger electric and large propane tank heaters to keep our bats and girls warm in the dugout for colder tournaments but nothing for mom sitting on the cold bleachers. This little propane heater is just the ticket and worked well for her at our last tournament. Outside it is not going to heat a large area but it will keep the hands and feet warm. Was well worth the price.
1,Texsport Heater unsafe,"The first time I tried this heater the gas squirted out from behind the black plastic control knob, not from the tank/heater connection. Very unsafe product. Texsport says to send it back. I would not recommend this heater. Will be asking for a refund. You get what you pay for, cheap is cheap. Peter."
5,Propane heater perfect for hunters,This is a great replacement heater for all you outdoor hunters. It will keep you plenty warm on those cold hunting days just sitting waiting for the big game to come by. It is quiet and user friendly.
4,Propane heater,I BOUGHT THIS HEATER FOR HUNTING. I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONCE AND IT WAS GREAT. WE HUNR FROM A BLIND AND IT REALLY KEPT US WARM. I'LL KNOW BETTER BY THE END OF JANUARY BUT SO FAR I REALLY LIKE IT. MONEY WELL SPENT.
4,Works good,This is good heater for the price. It puts out a lot of fumes so be careful. It does put out good heat.
2,Texsport Propane Heater,"It is very noisy, too noisy to use deer hunting. Also every once in awhile it surges and really gets loud. It does keep you warm, but it is not useful for my purpose."
2,Disappointed these were not full games,"These are just highlights of high school games these five have played. Why not show at least Lebron's games in their entirety? C'mon ESPN! Unless you're a fan of one of more of these players, I wouldn't bother."
1,Bad DIsk,The disk freezes and my son got no time to even review the DVD it was very disappointing and would rather just return it for my money back
2,did not fit.,"I guess they sold me the wrong part, because it didn't fit ford escort 1999, the space between the screws was to norrow."
4,Awesome,"This book is phenomenal. It's written with a philosophical/historical tone and delves deeply into the bases of bizzarre beliefs and their creators. A somewhat dry read, it maintains a factual presentation without blatant opinion, sarcasm or comedy. If you want that, however, visit www.insolitology.com and you'll have your laughter dosage for the day. Still, for the curious seekers of truth, this is a great means of learning that there really isn't any truth, save that which we make."
4,SPRAY WINDOW WASH,"I liked this window wash. It really did a good job, and was so easy!! I went right through the screens with it. Left some water spots, but may not have if I would have done my windows when it was cloudy."
1,DECEPTIVE SELLER SCOOTER9900,"I am the second person this seller has deceived. The listing says,""Convoy Assortment"" and you believe you are receiving what you see in the photo, especially since the title said assortment. Wrong! You receive ONE item and it is not even one of the pictured items. To make things worse, when you try to correspond with the seller he is a rude and belligerent man. Amazon.com has been wonderful and I have no problem with amazon...I have used them to purchase other items and have had great experiences."
5,Tastes Great and Sooooo Easy,Love this It is so easy ...Sometimes I throw some cubed chicken in this and make a meal out of it great for a side dish.
5,"Easy, cheap, and fresh",My son is addicted to this pasta. I use olive oil and put a can of sliced olives in. Amazon delivers fresh dated product at a great price.
3,Very little information about what the different herbs are used for.,"It has all the information you need for starting your herb business, just dont expect to learn what people use the herbs for."
3,Wrong Chords,"Why oh why does Hal Leonard arbitrarily change the key of songs. Honestly, it doesn't make any sense. Overall the book is fine, but if you plan to strum along with the original recordings you'll have to find yourself another book."
2,Wrong Key,"I found that most of the songs in this book are in the key of F, and most of Hank's tunes are not played in the key of F on his records. The publishers told me that they don't claim to match the keys of the record and they may have been changed for guitar and piano arrangements, which makes no sense to me. The songs and lyrics appear to be correct otherwise, and I just played along with the records to transpose the keys by hand. It was a pain, but worth it to have an accurate representation of one of the greatest collections of songs of all time."
2,Not Complete,"Although the title is ""Hank Williams Complete"" it is not complete and does not include songs such as ""Lost Highway"", arguably the second most recorded song Hank wrote, after ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry."" Also, the quality of the printing is questionable, about half the songs seem as though they are merely copies made from poor quality old mimeographs. Where this occurs the song notes are difficult to discern."
3,Hank Williams Complete,"This book, I have listed and just ok, because when I originally bought it, I believed it to be a biography."
4,Interactive Help,"I liked the fact that it explains the different symptoms and asks the reader to write down their own feelings and symptoms. This approach is helpful when someone needs help figuring out what it is they actually have. The sugggestions for catching your change in mood before it gets too far off is very helpful. Now, as a Grandmother of someone who has this disorder, how do I get the family and the patient to read the book and go through the exercises?"
5,Excellent Book,"The seller helped me overcome a shipment address issue, and got the book out to me right away. The book was in perfect condition when it arrived."
3,working at it,"Book arrived very fast and in great shape. It is okay. It just requires a lot of work on the part of the person with bipolar, especially at a time when it is difficult for that person to focus on anything. Definately requires the use of someone to help the bipolar person. The outsider can see things sooner. Could be a good help to someone with help."
5,Excellent resource!,"I recommend this to all my clients with Bipolar Disorder that I see in my private practice. This well-written workbook allows clients to easily grasp how to recognize triggers and better manage symptoms. Medication management is only half the battle, and this workbook teaches clients to appropriately manage the other half."
4,This book gives you insperation!,"This is a great book. It would work for anyone with bipolar, no matter what stage of your treatment your in. It really gave me a different perspective to my illness. I found out about my illness 4 years ago and this book still helped me to learn a lot of things that I had never thought of before. I was really great."
4,Helpful for you and family,As a clinical social worker I have given this book to several clients as well as my own adult son. It has been useful for them as well as their families in understanding Bipolar Disorder as a diagnosis and goes on to be very helpful in planning life strategies for success. The book does convey that medication is a necessity for success which can turn some people off but it provides plenty of concrete coping skills for other ways to manage moods. Family members find it helpful to understand and provide more appropriate support to their loved one. It is easily readable and the guide at the beginning gives you an idea of what to read to meet you where you are currently in your understanding and beliefs about Bipolar. It directs you clearly about use of the workbook format and tools. Definitely recommend this.
3,"Better for Bipolar I patients, than Bipolar II.","It seems to be much more for Bipolar I sufferers. I have Bipolar II and much of the material in the book didn't really apply to me. Though I'm sure it would be good if one had bipolar II, and I'm still working through the book in the areas that do apply to me."
4,educational for me as a bi polar person,"this book has allowed me to see the ways in which mania and depression really affect my life, but primarily for me, it allows one to study your behavior and changes and identify how to slow down and regulate what you are dealing with."
5,review of bipolar workbook,This book must be read by people who has bipolar Affective disorder.It sets out how to recognize recurrence of the disease and how to avoid it.It will improve patient lifestyle and minimze medications hence side effects. It should also be read by relatives and friends of patients who has this disorder.
4,Workbook Thoughts,"My therapist suggested this workbook. I am working in it at my own pace, and when we meet, we go through what I've done. We've worked on cognitive therapy for a long time, but it doesn't stick with me very well. The workbook helps to reinforce the concepts.The workbook can be used to refer back to when you get into an episode. It has sections on recognizing episodes, what to do when an episode arises, what not to do, when to call your doctor, etc. It's a good reference book to return to when your thinking starts to get distorted.I haven't had an episode for a few months, so I have not had the opportunity to see if it helps. I think going over the information and concepts are helpful, even if you already know a lot about bi-polar."
3,Workbook overview,The workbook could have given more examples of behavior that is manic and or depressed. There were an awful lot of referrals to different pages in the book without a lot of explanation. It would probably work best in conjunction with a therapist.
5,A great new album,"HipHope 2006 is a great album. I've got already an earlier edition from HipHope, and it is my most favourite cd. This record is that good as wel, and maybe even better. I like to hear music like DJ Maj, Grits, LA Symphony and T-bone, so this album gives me a lot of good hiphop songs with at the same time good christian lyrics. If we had no christmas in one month I would buy it now!AJ Hill"
3,Pretty good read for fans only...if you can stand the typos and factual errors,"Anyone who isn't a fan would find this book totally boring. It gives a decent bio of the band. However there are glaring typo's. Whitelaw writes that Isobel leaves B&S after the Toronto show in May of 2001. I was at that show and after some investigating found that it was May 2002. A few pages later He writes something like ""As the bus pulled out of Montreal sans Isobel..."" Um, hello!? Isobel left the band in Toronto! He also writes that God Speed you black emperor! are an American band, but any hipster worth his weight will tell you that they are from Montreal Canada. I'm sure there are many more mistakes in the book that others have noticed. A bio is all about the facts, you must nail the facts, and Whitelaw fails miserably in this department. Oh, and his alliterations become annoying after awhile."
5,Great book,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he can't put it down. For any Belle and Sebastian fan, this is a treasure!"
3,"It works, but it doesn't work miracles","We were evaluating this unit for use in our county squad cars, since we live in a semi-rural area, and cell coverage isn't 100 percent. We found that this unit works, but only if signal is present anyway. In other words, it isn't much better at receiving signal from the tower than is your phone - it helps a bit that the antenna is outside the car, but that is a limited improvement. If there is not cell signal present, this unit won't help.That said, it makes a pretty big difference for transmitting. So, if you find that you can hear people but they can't hear you, this unit is probably for you. In our case, we were really trying to improve reception in the cars for mobile data applications, and it was a marginal improvement."
2,There's just not much to do with this toy,"My daughter received this from her Grandparents for Christmas 2 years ago & has never really played with it. I waited until she was older & more ""into"" Barbie to see if things changed. This year she is TOTALLY into Barbie & even had a Barbie birthday party. But she still does not play with this toy. There just isn't much to it. It's more of a vanity table than a toy. There's a bed for Barbie but that's about it. No where else for Barbie to go. And the little pieces do get strewn & lost easily. I'm not really sure of the reason behind the tiny plates, cups & utensils that came with it...they don't really go with the theme. The detachable palm trees have already been broken & lost, as well as the swinging chair...lost. The one good part of this ""toy"" is the vanity stool which I would like to keep, even though we plan to sell the toy on Craig's List or at a second-hand shop to make room for a real Barbie house."
3,Fun Castle but with Quality Issues and Useless Vanity,"My 3 year daughter and 4 year old son have enjoyed playing with the castle since Christmas. It has a lot of fun features. However, the cardboard window back keeps falling off, the table gets stuck, and the bed canopy falls down. These were all issues from day one prior to any use by my children. Also, the vanity part of the toy is worthless. The storage space under the seat is less than 1/2 inch, the other storage drawer is taken up by all of the loose toys that came with the vanity, and the mirror is covered in fingerprints from pushing the bed up and down."
4,Great Christmas present for my daughter!,"My [...] daughter loves to play with this toy. For the great price I got and with Amazon's great customer service, I'm very happy with my purchase. And most of all, it made my daughter's Christmas a delightful one."
3,Favorite Christmas Toy... but,"My daughter lit up when she unwrapped this gift! It was easy to put together and looks very nice... but it does not fit her barbie island princess dolls!? I am searching and am not sure shich ones will fit, but I think I now need to buy new Rosella dolls to fit this castle. I am a bit disappointed and so was my daughter."
3,Fun and Functional,My daughter that that this was the coolest it functions like a real vanity with storage and a mirror (not great quaility of mirror)and she can play with her barbies also so over all a hit that gets used and not just set up and forgotten
4,Love that Coffee,"Having visited Costa Rica in 2006; I purchased several types of coffee. I found this in a grocery store in San Jose. It was only when I got home I found that it was the best tasting of all the coffies I purched. I could not find it here in Chicago but went on line to several other sites and found it however the prices were a bit extreme. As usual, I went back to Amazon and found the Britt Coffee, it tastes just awesome. It's worth the trip back (twisting mountains and all) just to purchase this one but I think I'll let Amazon do the shopping for me!"
4,If you really prefer dark roast coffee...,"... these Costa Rican beans are alright. I am not a huge fan of dark roast coffees, particularly when it comes to Costa Rican coffees, but my wife is and she gave this product a solid thumbs up. It has the usual Costa Rican flavor - citrusy, crisp ""attack"", light-bodied - and the extra roasting time seems to round out the ""finish"" nicely. The dark roast does cast a stronger cloud over the entire brew. The dark roast style also lowers the caffeine content quite a bit, so if you like an extra caffeine kick in the morning, this coffee is not for you. This would be a solid after-dinner brew or afternoon coffee to sit back and enjoy."
5,Best coffee,"I have been getting this coffee for 3 years, ever since we were in Costa Rica. It is the best. We have tried others but always come back to this one. We order it directly from Cafe Britt. Try it and enjoy!!!"
4,"Incomparable writing, but not his best CD.","There's no question that Bill Holman is a master writer and a living legend. But I was disappointed that the recording quality didn't nearly measure up toBrilliant Corners: The Music Of Thelonious MonkorA View From the Side, each of which exemplify how a big band should be mixed."
4,great little book,"I was expecting something much larger, but this little book has come in really handy. The paper is very thin, but the print is still clear to read."
5,A Fantabulistic Read !,"As dew nestles upon morning thistles, so do I with my Greek-English dictionary."
5,"Splendid service, as ever!","Many years ago I was loaned a publication by Capt. Jack Broome entitled ""Make a signal"" extremely entertaining, couldn't find it available this year on Amazon however, there was ""Make another signal"" which I duly purchased. All was as described, the book was in superb condition, no dogeared pages, paperback cover in great order and I am extremely happy with the whole process, courtesy of Amazon. co.uk. Who could ask for more? Well done Amazon, your reputation is still intact as far as I'm concerned"
5,high energy ! high impact!,"Just saw this group perform at The Bottom Line in New York.They were unbelievable. Eden White has so much energy that she gives to her audience. You could really feel the anger of ""Nice"" ,a song about a failed relationship. ""Twisted"" had everyone dancing in their seats. The songs which featured Eden White at the piano and on keyboard captivated us all. She plays the piano better than any new performer in a long time. Don't miss the chance to see this group live."
5,pop music like it should be!,Eden takes the listener through the highs and lows of modern life and love. These songs resonate and rock. Call your local radio stations and demand your Eden White!!!visit her website
3,Great book. Over-priced.,"This is a great book to learn about songwriting in general and also great if you love the Beatles and want to learn about how they practiced their craft. I agree with the other reviewers so I won't go into any more detail than that.My huge problem with this book (Kindle version) is that it is about $22 cheaper on iBooks! That is unbelievable. I know, I know. I should have checked out other prices first, right? But based on my experience there is usually only a one dollar or so difference between the two if there is any difference at all. I feel majorly ripped off. Anyway, this is a wonderful book. Just be sure to check around on the price before you purchase it."
1,A clueless marketing hype,"Lots of fancy layouts, probably because of the ad man's background, but nothing substantial to really give serious advice. More a marketing gimmick than a real book. Big bold prints and fonts, thick glossy paper, like an expensive annual report."
4,Inspiring!,It felt me feeling inspired with different stories and tips from asian and global entreprenuers like the McDonald brothers and Charles & Keith. Giving you ideas and a quick start guide on how to start a business.
3,Check the expiration date,"Love this stuff, and ordered several different flavors from Amazon at once. When they arrived, half the boxes were already out of date and the others had no more than two months left.Beware!"
3,Sweet,"I first heard of The Format when I saw them opening up for Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World almost 2 weeks ago. I think they are good background music and have a nice poppy feeling, but nothing groundbreaking."
5,The Format,"This Cd is one of the best ever made, i play it in my car every day and you know how sometimes you get sick of a song or music this never seems to happen here. I have had it since sometime last year like november or something and all the song are so incredible, my favorite has to be number 7 on your pourch thats just the best song these guys are awesome you will love this cd. If you buy this cd you wont regret it!Love,Ash"
5,More....just give me more.......,Thought Honorary Title was good but The Format is incredible.I hope that main stream producers dont jack the sound.This is a upbeat grassroots album with a hint of the 80's folk pop.If you like this then check out Copeland.Similar.
4,Disappointed,"I saw The Format live with Something Corporate and Yellowcard and absolutely loved them. I went out the day after the concert and bought the cd. The first time I listened to it, I was extremely disappointed. They had so much more energy when they were performing live. After listening to the cd a few more times, I realized that the songs are catchy and sort of fun. My point: don't give up on them. They aren't so horrible."
1,"""Interventions & Lullabies","Incredible CD, I can't stop listening to it. The Format is the greatest band ever!tommykasper"
5,A great CD all around!,"True, the music on this album is not groundbreaking, but it is addicting. I've listened this CD endless times and I love every single track. It has a great sound, like a mixture between retro pop (think 1960s or 70s) and the more alternative modern rock sound. There's a lot of things I could say about this CD. It has terrific lyrics (escpeically for the songs 'On Your Porch' and 'Tune Out') I also enjoy the fact that a lot of the songs make references to place in Arizona that I know and have grown up with so it creates these great visual images."
5,Interventions and Lullabies- really great CD,"excellent. one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. In fact, this quickly became one of my favorite CDs. Every song from start to finish is catchy. Solid pop album.Everyone that I know who has heard it has fallen in love with it as I have. If you think the CD is good...check out the live show.Best tracks: First Single, Tie The Rope, Give It Up, Tune Out"
5,Amazing,This cd is absolutely amazing and will leave you wanting more of the format. EVery song is so perfect they will blow your mind. This is the best cd and is worht every penny. Buy it and buy The Format EP
5,"If the format were a person, it would be the man.","6 months ago, i heard the format for the first time, it was the EP, and i was DJ-ing at my college radio station. when i heard the cd, i understood why people liked it, and brushed it off as ""ok."" fast forward, its april 18th, the third day of the annual skate and surf festival in asbury park, nj. i'm in front of the stage waiting for Straylight Run, and the format comes onstage. instantly i was an addict, i rushed to the local cd store where my brother and i purchised inteerventions and lullabies, one of the best cds i have heard in years."
5,a great debut album.,"The Format capture the perfect blend of melodic hooks and sincere lyrics on their 12-track debut album ""Interventions and Lullabies"". The album starts out with the catchiest of the 12, a song cleverly titled ""The First Single"". This track is sure to see it's share of radio air time, along with the track ""Sore Thumb"" shows reflections of another Phoenix band, Jimmy Eat World. Fan favorites ""Give It Up"" and ""Tune Out"" are sure to make you want to dance, while the emotional ""On Your Porch"" gives the album a nice change of pace to start the second half of the album. These guys bring the energy live, with the music matching or exceding the emotion caught on this album. This is the best debut album I have heard in a long time."
2,Sweet piece of fiction,"This is a very sweet story about a time, place, and man that was the construct of the author of this book. Historians and philosophers will continue to debate whether Lao Tzu ever existed or, if the Tao Te Ching was the work of many men. This book, however, portrays a decidedly Judeo/Christian perspective to the man called Lao Tzu and his life and times. The book is inacurate in it's portayal of life and philosophy/religion during the Han Dynasty. The author clearly misrepresents the history and beliefs in ancient China in a desire to mold Chinese thinking into a monotheistic belief system. If the reader is willing to set aside the historical and philosophical truths of the Chineses culture, the story is set forth as a very sweet parable. As someone who takes the Chinese culture seriously, I was not able to do so."
3,More Dreadlocks in the pictre then actually on wig,My only complaint would be that there are more dreadlocks visible in the picture of the product then there actually are on the wig...but other than that it's pretty good.
1,Not as Advertised in the Picture,"I received this product a couple of days ago for use at a Halloween party this weekend - there are about 1/2 as many dreads attached to the hat I got than shown in the picture. The hat itself looks like the one shown, but it's very large and no elastic in the head band so I'll have to pin it. If there were time to return this I would."
3,They are ok but not like picture,"Just got it in. See the pictures I posted. Like others mentioned, the original picture is not what you get. There needs to be about 6 to 8 more dreads to match the picture. The length of the dreads are good, about 18"". The hat is good, it doesn't stretch too much and is a bit big, but I guess you could pin it to make it smaller if needed. It fits my head ok, so I'll wear it as is. Overall, it'll work for what I need, but the picture is a bit deceiving.Edit 11-17-12I had added two pictures showing exactly what you get. However, I see the pictures have been removed. Oh well... I tried."
1,Deceptive Picture,Don't buy this. What you get looks like weaves and not dreads I'm sending this back! I was very disappointed with my purchase.
2,I wouldn't buy this one if I were you,"I'd wanted to be a rasta for Halloween this past fall. I was cheap and didn't want to pay a whole lot. With my Prime account, I then I paid something like $19 for it and free two-day shipping.Pros:1. Cost2. ...?Cons:1. Small, very small2. Uncomfortable3, Poorly woven tam, up close the holes are so big it looks like giant mesh4. Sparse on the dreads, I think there might be 10 altogether5. In NO WAY looks real, not even in the 'ha ha, you can tell that's a costume' kind of wayI could easily make another handful of cons for you, but that would be giving this thing more of my time than I'd like to. Just don't buy it. For mere dollars more, you could probably find something 200% better than this thing, or possible something even better than that. Even if you end up paying $30, this thing isn't even worth the savings. If you buy it, you're just putting yourself out by $20; and you're still going to need a rasta tam with dreads."
2,A Book Based on a Pointless Gimmick,"Some of the characterization of the girl Sam leaps into is cute, but for the most part, ""The Wall"" was too gimmicky for my tastes. The idea is, he leaps into this girl's life when the Berlin Wall is being built and later when it is torn down. I guess that's supposed to mirror the time the barriers in her family were built up and later when she and her brother finally had the courage to tear them down and face their father's abuse. Whatever. The Wall angle was really pointless, and the second leap into the woman's life was so short that it left no impact whatsoever. Altogether, an underwhelming QL effort."
5,good book,"I enjoyed the story line. I know a lot didn't like the ideaof it being Sam's mind that leaped, but it worked in thisstory. Good writing, good story."
5,Good-size truck,"I gave this truck to my three year-old nephew, who is autistic. It did not take him long to find out how to turn the flashlight off and on. The fact that the truck is big is also a plus. He spends a lot of time on the floor with it and it always discovering the different ways the flashlight shines on a variety of surfaces in a room."
2,"Great, except falls apart!","This stroller is great in terms of the comfort of the ride for our daughter - we walk a lot in our neighborhood and have to traverse bad sidewalks and curbs. We don't use it for jogging. It folds nicely, and the weather protection is great in winter. We love the stroller, except that it is so poorly built that we have had to replace the back tires twice now, and our daughter is only a year old! In addition to the tires (which took me time and frustration to replace), the screws on the handle have come out twice. The customer service agent I spoke to the first time sent us free parts, but they took 8 weeks to arrive. I would go with a similar stroller that doesn't fall apart."
1,This was a terrible stroller,"This stroller really was poor. We were surprised, because we really liked our MacLaren umbrella stroller and were expecting great things from this one. We got the stroller, and the handle promptly fell off, again and again. You can't turn a corner with it, which is fine if you only want to walk/jog in a straight line. I thought this was VERY unsafe. I guess there were some good things about it, but the handle coming off made it unusable. I emailed the company, but no response; probably because I mentioned the word RECALL in the subject line. I would NOT buy this stroller. They should stick to the umbrella style."
1,Disappointed in durability,"It folds nicely and works OK, but it's not durable. The screws come out and they are british-type screws so you can't get them in US hardware shops. You can make do for some of them, but when a screw fell out of the handle turn function, I had to return it to MacLaren -- twice! They were nice enough to cover shipping so I only had to pay to box it up, but it is inconvenient to keep sending it back. I wouldn't buy it again. It also trails to the right and that is not seemingly fixable."
1,horrible,"This stethoscope is horrible! After years of working in pediatrics, I have switched to home health care....which requires me to see adult as well as pediatric patients. I have a Littman pedi stethoscope, but needed to replace my 20-year-old sprague stethoscope to have something appropriate to use on adults. I was totally dissatisfied with this one....it is impossible to hear out of! No matter which ear & head pieces I tried, the sounds were so faint that it was impossible to accurately hear anything. I returned it for a refund...I will just get an adult Littman & carry two stethoscopes instead."
4,Interesting Read,"This was a very good read that kept me captivated with a great plot and interesting characters. All of the events that happened hit a little too close to home having grown up close to New York city, but wouldn't surprise me based upon how people live up there. The author brings light to many factors that we overlook during an age based upon commercialism that doesn't worry about it effects on the environment. Opened up my eyes to what we are doing and what I can personally do to try to fix the damage."
5,Love this music set!,Barely madei it ouf of the box. Still loves this after a year.wish it came in a carry case though instead came cardboard box
5,Great music set,My son loves instruments -one that we needed was the cymbals. He got to use them for a preschool perforce but trying to find them individually in retail is tough. Plus the online cymbals sold separately are pricey compared to this set. My don opened it immediately when he got it.
2,didnt find it good,I bought this with checking reviews and thought it will be good for my 18 months son...however the inside box seal was broken and some one has already used it! first item from Amazon with such quality...the quality of the instruments didnt attract me that much since for a small kid those are not soothing however much loud....2 items were not durable at all and my son will sure ly damage it after 3-4 time use...overall do not recommend..
2,parts missing and 1 part broken,The UPS driver arrived at the end of lunch. I was excited to share this with my grandson and his family. I was surprised and disappointed to find 2 parts missing and one part broken. The triangle was missing though its striker was present; the Mallet for the Soprano Sounder was missing. And 2 and a half Mallets were included for the Cymbals. This is going back in hopes that we will get a complete set next time.Hohner 6 Piece Rhythm Instrument Set
1,MADE IN CHINA,"This is not made in Europe or USA per search criteria; it is made in Israel, USA and CHINA. Hmmmmmmm... cadmium, lead, melamine?? Pick your poison, but either way, my kid will not be getting such a ""gift"" from CHINA!!"
4,instrument set,Cute set. Does not take wear & tear well. My little boy broke parts minutes after taking it from the box. Inexpensive for what you get.
4,Just what I wanted for my kids!,"Nice little toy music instruments. Kids love them! So, the product itself is really good.Unfortunately, this was intended for Christmas. While the packege got here in time, the contents were incomplete! One of the sticks was missing and the mallets were not like on the picture. I did not have time to send the package back and request a new one on time for Christmas. It seemd like it was a used product, none of the instruments were wrapped, they were just thrown into a box..."
1,Not happy with this toy,I bought this product based on positive reviews by other parents but I found the product poorly made and not very child friendly. My 2 year old loves musical instruments but she does not like playing with these ones. First I had to put away the triangle and the two red sticks because my daughter and her friends kept hurting themselves with them. The other small sticks also seem ready to fall apart and so does the tamburine. I wish i had bought some other musical instruments from the other well know and reliable brands.
4,"Good, but not a wow toy","I ordered this for my Salvation Army Angel Tree 4 year old who wanted a musical toy. This really seemed to fit the bill online, but when it arrived I was a little underwhelmed. I had seen similar toys in stores and they all seemed a lot bigger. Unfortunately, this just didn't seem like the exciting gift a 4 year old would want on Christmas. I decided to go out and buy a different toy for my angel, but will keep this and give it to my 1 year old daughter who will love it."
5,Fun toy,"We got this set for our daughter for Christmas when she was 18 months old. She has really enjoyed playing with all of the instruments. We keep them in a basket in our room as something to keep her occupied while she's there. She loves to hand my husband and I each one or two and then play one herself. It's cute & fun. The cymbals do sound pretty bad, but we aren't into ""real"" music, so for us, it's fine. The rest are like what we remember from music class as children.We did buy a morraca to go with the set...at a local store. I get a little nervous when she uses the tambourine as a drum, but so far so good...she's not that rough.When it arrived, I thought it seemed like it had been opened. We received 3 blue mallets instead of 2 blue & 1 red. Doesn't seem to matter. All of the parts, including info cards on each instrument were there & in good condition."
3,Meticulously explicit,"If you like a story where 95% of the pages shows a succession of sexual performances, then this is the book you're looking for. It is really not for the faint of heart. I'm far from hypocrite and like erotic novels, romantic stories, etc but it was excessive. It's like mixing too much sugar in a cake... And you're are unable to root for the protagonists... With this volume I had bought the continuation, ""The Possession of Celia"". I will read it, of course after other books I have already started. Who knows Celia will finally meet her soul mate, with satisfying sex...yes!! and why not with love, self-respect and real tenderness in the baggage?"
3,A woman finding herself.,"Celia, is a young woman deeply in love with Colin. Yet, he is accused of murder, and Jason, Colins rich cousin, is hiding them, for a price. Celia must do whatever Jason says. She learns to love it. Celia, finds herself through the ordeals and finds that she had 2 lovers all along."
4,fabulous watch,"This watch turned out to be better than I had expected. I wear it casual and with work suits. I also, luv LAMB shoes!!!"
5,One of my faves :),One of my favs a great double feature dvd set of this and The Babysitter (1980) would be great they work well together :)
3,McCARTHY HAS DONE BETTER!!!!!,"Have read several books by Gary McCarthy. He usually does much beter than this one. This is about Thomas Atherton who grew up in the East. He always wanted to go west and finally gets his chance to go and try to find the last buffalo herd. He is to report back to Cyrus Rutherford who wants to go kill the last of the buffalo. Along the way Thomas meets many interesting people. Sally, Moose and many Indians. After much time they finally find a herd of buffalo. Will Thomas report back, will he and Sally get together, what about Moose????? The story is slow moving in places. Does have a pretty good ending. If you want to read better McCarthy books, try, The Gringo Amigo, Blood Brothers, The Mustangers or Sodbusters. I think they are all better than the Buffalo Hunters."
3,Wicking t-shirt,"Well, Ok. It is what is advertised. The feel of the shirt is very polyestery feeling."
2,Poor quality,"I bought these cups for my beach home because I love the look, unfortunately, two of them already, while I was washing dishes they slip from my hand, and the bottom part of the cup fell apart like if they were just poorly glued together"
1,"ARTLAND IRIS FOOTED ICE TEA, 18-ONCE, GREEN, SET OF 4","ORDERED 8, 4 ARRIVED BROKEN DON'T WANT ANY MORE. I RETURNED THEM BY UPS. I DO NOT WANT THEM REPLACED."
2,too big,The glasses are huge and I had to return them. They looked ridiculous on the table due to the size. I think you would be wasting beverages by filling the glass to the top. The quality was ok (equal to the price).
3,broken delivery,"I love the glasses, but they were broken when they arrived. I returned them, and the next shipment was broken as well."
3,Horrible Packing Almost All Broken,I received these before Christmas and didn't open until Christmas Day. I received 12 and only 2 weren't broken. The boxes were all repacks and no cushion so they were smashed. I was really disappointed and would not recommend this vendor. I have emailed Amazon and haven't heard back. I think I could have bought 2 glasses for $100.
5,READ MY REVIEW,"Of all the 25 to 30 Fear Street I've read, there were only one or two i'd give a 7 out of 10 to, the rest i'd give a 9.5 or a 10. Fear Street are the best books. After I read the back cover of College Weekend, to me it didn't sound to great, but it really surprised me. It was definately a 10. It had everything a book needs, mystery, horror, suspense, romance, and great detail(Stine puts excellent detail in his books). I finished this book in two days and I read it every chance I got. The detail was so great I had to take my time reading it. I always do that with Stine's books anyways. My advice to you is to go to a bookstore or library and get this book. I hope you read it and enjoy it as much as i did. P.S. I think this book would make a great movie!"
5,This has stuck with me for 14 years!,"When I was a kid, R. L. Stine was my absolute favorite author, I read all the Goosebumps book and eventually came across his Fear Street series. I read this when I was 10 and it still haunts me to this day... definitely worth a read! :)"
3,To Predictable,"Usually, With Fear Street novels the end comes as acompletesurprise to me, which is why I like them so much. But this onedid not. There were not many characters, so you kinda had an idea who the killer was. The ending, though was really good which is why I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2. My Opinion? Take it or leave it. END"
5,MARTHA,I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT'S ABOUT TINA AND HER COUSIN HOLLY. THEY ARE GOING TO SEE TINA'S BOYFRIEND BUT CHIRS TELLS THEM THAT HE IS AWAY ON A CAMPING TRIP. THEN A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS START HAPPENING. READ THIS BOOK IT'S THE BEST.
5,Fear Street: College Weekend,"Tina was dying to see her boyfriend Josh, but when she got to the college were he was, he was in the mountains with ""car trouble."" Josh's roomate, Christopher Roberts, picks Tina and her cousin, Holly, and takes them to the dorm were Josh lives. But then suddenly Holly disappears. And.... read the book to find out what happens to Holly, and what happens to Josh and Tina."
2,VERYDISAPPOINTING,"this book looked good at first,but it kept getting worse and worse.at the end,i wanted 2 stick an ax threw it and toss it in the fire.many things in it r not answered,many things.i saw the main suspect in the beginning,and thought it couldn't be him,'cause its always the last person u expect,and went jumping 2 the least suspected people,and took a lot of time wondering y it might b 1 of them,and it turned out 2 be the most obvious person,and they dont even say!! A BAD CHOICE,DONT READ IT!!"
4,Wow...,"You knew the killer and it was all screwy dewy by the ending. It was pretty good, but not one of Stine's best. Didn't keep me in suspense AT ALL."
3,College Weekend,"I rate this story 3 stars , because the story will be boring then interesting and suspensful. I wanted to read it , but thenIdidnt want to read it. The suspensful parts were full of action. thats what really kept me in this book. I think the title ""College Weekend"" doesn't match tis story very wel. Its an okay book."
3,I was disappointed!! *sniff*,"This was a book filled with many components such as romance, horror, and suspense. It had all these cool things--but a bummer ending. It was sad and abrupt, and I felt like crying. Go ahead and read it if you like, but also bring your hankie."
4,A fifth grade inventor,"I thout the book Frindle was an ok book. It wasn't the best book I've read because it seemed to easy to read. In this book a boy named Nick thinks of a new name for a pen and Nick and his teacher have a ""battle"". I recomend it for first-fourth grades.By: Rachel"
4,A fith grde boy with a new word,I really liked the book! It was fun and interesting. It took me about 2 days to read I liked it so much. It was a really good book to read. It was not the best book... but I liked it! I recomend it for 2 to 5 grade. Frindle was very creative. Pen is out frindle is in.
3,Well . . .,"My daughter read this. Basically, some kids start a movement to call pens ""frindles."" That's the point. The sort of annoying behavior we see in real life is also annoying when depicted in pointless fiction like this. My 10-year old avid reader is a sharp and qualified critic, and she didn't like this one."
2,"Book Review of ""Frindle""","I think there are way beter bokks then ""Frindle"". The book told too much about one subject.The setting was at a school and at a boy's house in modern times. The main character in this story was Nick Allen. An interesting plot line was when Nick got the school saying Frindle and not pen. Also when Nick had to put his name and the date on the back of an envolope from his teacher and he wouldn't get it unless the fighting was over and that doesn't happen untill ten years later.I think this book would be a wonderful book for any 5th or 6th grader that likes a good fantasay novel. I wouldn't ever read this book again. There are better books than this one."
1,Pen name,I think it was a boring book.I could've been outside playing hockey or something.There was really no point somebody made up a new word big deal. Nick and his teacher got in a fight and she kept kids after school. Boring.
5,Frindle,Frindle is a great book.It is about a kid who makes up a word and his teacher hates it. Then the hole town starts to use it. I would give Frindle a five. It is a mystery book.
2,Frindle,:-) that means I liked the book and Nick is sometimes crazy and Mrs. Granger is really mean I liked
5,kids books,It is great to have kids read and really great to have a place to go to find excellent books - Amazon.
4,School book,"My son, age 9, had to get this book for school. He actually enjoyed it more than he thought!"
4,i have read that they had to do many dictionary's. because their teacher loves and loves them.,i love this book. it brings a smile on my face.i just want to keep reading until my mouth gets tired.:) :)
5,how much I love frindle,it is a interesting book .i like the way that mrs.granger pretended to go against frindle.i just love frindle.i am glad i have it.
5,Frindle,"Have you ever read the good-natured book Frindle? If not I forgive you. You should be eager to read it! It's about a boywho is easy-going. His name is Nick. He's zany,witty,and wise. Nick's inventive ways conduct a plan.He's honest when people ask who, what,when, or why.In closing, I hope you fallow my strong-willed heart by reading this book!"
4,An Exciting Book About A Pen,"Frindle was a pretty good book because it's exciting and funny. It has some funny comedy that will keep you laughing for days because the main character is in a war with a teacher. I find that funny. This book is very exciting. But there are acouple of boring parts, which is why I gave this book four stars."
4,A great humorous book,I gave this book four stars becuase it was funny and humorus. It was cool how Nick And Miss Granger deacleared the war over frindle . It was also funny how Nick turned the word pen into frindle.You should read this book beacuse it is was cool and great.
3,Funny Story,"Would you want the biggest dictionary freak in the world to be your teacher? Well, in this book you find out that you would. In this book there's a young boy named Nick. He is full of many surprises. To me the ending is good. This book is funny, so if you like funny books, I suggest you read it."
4,Frindle by Andrew Clements,Frindle is a really good book. It is about Nick Allen. A school boy who loves pens so much. I strongly say that you should read it.
4,"Draws the kids in, and parents too.","Well written with some great lessons for young kids and teens (mine are 7 & 9, and they loved it).Several fundamentally strong academic ideas that got the kids thinking and learning. We have had several discussions on the 'mightier than the sword' chapter and saying."
4,From Alec age 10yrs.,"I bought this book for my grandson Alec for his birthday. He read it on his iPad. I was interested to know how he liked his first experience with an e-book, and if he liked the book.Alec's review - At the beginning it didn't really make sense to me, but as I read on I started to understand what it was about. Overall the book was fabulous and I couldn't put it down. My favourite part was the last chapter when Allen made friends with Mrs Granger."
4,Great Book,A lot of time we ponder in life over questions. In this book a boy ponders over the question of how different words got named what they are. In Andrew Clemets well written book for young elementary school children he brings to life the story of a boy who starts a trend. Instead of calling a pen a pen he calls it a Frindle. The only problem is that his teacher is against him making up that name.
4,Really funny book!,"I think this book was very funny. It is about a boy who invents a new word for a pen. He calls it a frindle. The boy's name is Nick Allen, and his new word is spreading across the country, and he can't stop it. It is funny because so many kids are using the word now, and they have to stay after school and write a hundred sentences. I don't know what other books Andrew Clements has written, but they must be good books. I hope he has written other books like these. He puts a lot of dramatic parts in the book and has a creative and imaginative mind."
4,A Frindle Party,"I just loved this book. It was funny, although a little babyish for 4th graders. It was a very easy and quick book to read."
5,The Surprises of Frindle.,"The book is about a kid, who thinks of a good idea.In Language Arts, one day he thinks about it, and he tells his friends. The Language Arts teacher does not like the idea. In the end there's an amazing surprise, you would never imagine to happen! If you like a book with fun, and adventure, here is the book for you. The Language Arts teacher, Mrs. Granger, Starts out mean and strict. In the end, you will be amazed by what she does. When you read this book , you will never forget it. by: Kendall age 12 and Britany age 11 Frindle rocks!!!!!!"
3,Good Kid with a Bad Teacher,This book is a very good one. It is a very funny book. It is called Frindle by Andrew Clements. Frindle is about a boy who changes the name of a pen to Frindle. Do you like funny books? Do you like fake words? Then you will enjoy reading Frindle.
3,not the best!!,"Whell it was NOT the BEST book i have read by andrew clements, i read beter books by him. if i could rate this book in halfs it would be 2 & a half at the most."
3,How I like Frindle,I like Frindle beacse it tells about his life. Like when he made the classroom a beach
3,It was a funny book.,"I really liked this book because I thought that it was very humorous and interesting book. This book was a story about what happens to a young boy who uses his imagination and creativity. He invents words like ""frindle"". This one ends up in a dictionary. This was a very good book."
4,an 8 year old's perspective,"This is a wonderfly thrilling book that puts creativity in a boy or girls mind.It will play a follow the leaders game in thier mind,showing that since the main charactar can change the world so can they. and to top that, put tons of excitement in thereaders mind running like in a marathon, racing, racing, racing."
5,Frindle,This was a terrific book! I would definitely recommend this book. This is the first Andrew Clements book that I have read so far and it was outstanding!
5,"love, love, loved it","I just read this with my third grader and find myself reccomending it to everyone I see. It is entertaining, inspiring and very fun to read. A must have for 3-5th graders."
4,Frindle,"I read Frindle by Andrew Clements. I gave Frindle 4 out of 5 stars rating. I thought Frindle was a good book. Its pretty cool how Nick makes up a word and its heard all around the world. I like how Nick is smart and he is a trouble maker. It's funny how Nick's mom and Nick's principal argue. The teachers at Nick's school said that anyone who said the word Frindle has to stay after school and write this sentence one hundred times: Iam writting this punishment with a pen. That made everyone want to use the word even more. I don't really understand that. Its awesome how Nick was on t.v. I wish I was Nick because he became rich because the word Frindle was on merchandise. The word Frindle was also put in the new dictionary. Nick must have felt great knowing that his word was in the dictionary. I recommend that you read this book. All in all, Frindle is an overall good book."
5,Funny Word For pen,"If you like books about new words, Frindle by Andrew Clements is just for you. The main character, Nick who turned his classroom into a tropical island, invented a new word, frindle. A year later in fourth grade all the fourth graders fancied that word and used it instead of pen. Then the problem came with Mrs. Granger, Nick teacher, slows him down by adding a new rule that says, ""Whoever mentions the word frindle will be forced to write 100 sentences after school."" While the fourth graders stayed after school, their parents worried and called the school. Like fighting on chess bard the battle went on! If you want to know the ending buy it now and read. I highly recommend this story because it is humorous and it makes you feel that you are character."
5,How inventive are you?,"Nick, the main character, decides to change a word and I think that it is great! He is making a big change in America and to our English language. A few buds and I are trying to change the word ""Sharpener"" to phraper. It is an awesome story!"
2,not really,for my fourth grade reading class last year this was an assigned book. i thought that it was really boring. i don't know why i usally love andrew clements but this book not his best. my favorite book by him would definitly be the report card which i dont think is sold on the kindle.~alyssa monroe pa
5,BK Ms.raneire period 2,FrindleBy Andrew ClementsThe book Frindle by Andrew Clements is about a boy named nick who is a big troublemaker and in fourth grade. When he gets into fifth grade it's a new ballgame. She loves the dictionary it takes 2 of the strongest men in the class to carry it. She says everyone should have it. If she sees you with gum she will tape it an index card and ware it for the day and have it signed and then brought back to school. Nick comes up with a new word it is called frindle. It means pen. Nick gets detention all most every day because he calls the pen frindle. Soon his school says it. And the town it called the home of the frindle. He his teacher likes it and enters it in the dictionary. Does he make it or does he fail.I loved the book because it had so many adventures and he did it. I would recommend the book the people. I would say the age from where you could read it is 9-12. I hope I inspired people and kids like me to get out there and read.
4,New word,Andrew clements is the author of a raelistic fiction story book frindle.Frindle is a pen. With a boy name Nick makes words. My favorite part is when Nick told his class to use frindle.He wants to make everyone in school use frindle except his teacher Mrs.Granger. Mrs.Granger wants to stop the word frindle she doesn' t like the word because everyone was using the word frindle.I dont like the part when Mrs.Granger made them do 100 sentences.
5,Something of a Classic is Right,"A review for this book says that if there's any justice, Clements has something of a classic on his hands. That's certainly an understatement. If there's any justice, this book will be remembered forever and will be a staple of school cirriculums.In ""Frindle,"" a boy finds himself tired of the same old school routines. The boy, Nick, always has great new ideas that don't break the rules, but always stir up controversy and interest. He calls them ""thought-grenades."" His biggest comes when a stiff English teacher tells him that words come about because people simply accept them as meaning what they do. He then invents a new word, frindle, to use instead of the word pen. It stirs a huge controversy that even he can no longer control. But the rewards are well worth the risk.This book has important ideas about free speech, learning and taking the right action. An inspirational story for all who want to make a difference."
5,great book,"I bought a classroom set of this book and just finished reading it with my 3rd and 4th grade class. When I went to collect the books, half of the class asked me if they could buy the book from me. That has never happened to me as a teacher before. It is a nice, short book with many avenues for discussion and thought, a great way to get kids hooked on reading."
3,Frindle review,"Frindle, written by Andrew Clements, is a good book. If you like imagination and creation books Frindle is the book for you. This book is about a boy named Nick Allen who is ten years old, is very creative, and does not like his fifth grade teacher. One day Nick decides to make up his own word, frindle, which means pen. If you read this book you can see what kind of trouble Nick Allen can get into. If you are under thirteen, you will like this book a lot."
2,A Pen Turns Into A Frindle,"I think Frindle was alright. Frindle wasn't my favorite book, though. I think Nick's ideas were pretty funny and a little entertaining,but not my favorite."
2,THERE'S A FRINDLE IN THE CLASS PICTURE,I thought the book was a little bit humorous and babyish. THE book was also alittle bit to easy for a forth grader. I also thought it focoused to much on the whole class. I didn't like Nick or the whole class.
3,Will Frindle Survive,I thought that frindle was okay. Nick was a smart kid but his tricks were not very clever. I would recomend this book to anyone but it wasnt very good. I thought frindle was easy to read.
3,Frindle,The book frindle takes place in Lanuage arts in 5th grade.The teacher is Mrs. Granger and Nick is a trouble maker in school.Then outside Nick found pen and called it a frindle.The book is funny beacuse of Nick and Mrs. Granger andthe word war.
1,BOR-ING,"This book is sort of boring. It's about a kid named, Nick Allen, who can turn any school upside down! His own teacher,Mrs.Granger, is a old women who loves the dictionary and expects everyone in her class to have one at home. Soon Nick comes up with the word ""frindle"", another word for pen. Soon the word spreads across the Westfield town. Then Mrs. Chatham, the school pricipal, comes to talk to Nick's parents. Everywhere Nick goes he feels as he is being watched. Read this book to see what our young hero will do in the end of this book.-Jocelin V."
1,The kid's word.,In the book Frindle Nick Allen's friend drops her pen so Nick picksit up and instead of saying pen Nick says Here's your frindle.
1,frindle,"I loved the book but the end did not make sense to me,other than that itwas ok.But calling a pen a frindle was a great idea.It was a great idea ,but i thought it was kind of boring.Maybe action would kick it up.I think the illistrador of the cover is an artists.Other than that it was not the best,it was terrible."
1,"So stupid, so pointless, so annoying.","I doubt if anyone has ever strung so many words together without managing to utter anything that was interesting, revealing, insightful, challenging, or thought provoking. Every ""character"" in this misconceived train wreck is a transparent cut-out. Every line of dialogue is hackneyed and irritating. There is no reason why anyone should ever read this book, ever. But if you are a teacher or parent just looking for anything to occupy your kids for a little while, this might work for you."
4,"Karina - Farmersville, CA",In this book there is a boy who has a lot of ideas. One time his friend and he went playing. His friend found a fancy pen. He got the pen and called it frindle instead of pen. His teacher did not like the word frindle. Mrs. Granger didn't like the words that were not in the dictionary. I recommend you to buy this book because it is very interesting.
4,new word for pen,Andrew Clements is the author of fiction books Oneof his best books are frindle.Frindle is about a boy named Nick.One day Nick finds a new word for pen.He wants the whole school to know the new word.Mrs.Granger wants to put a stop to all this.Find outthe rest in the book.I like this book becaese to meit's a humorous book.
5,A Great Book,"If you want to read a great book this is the one. It's called Frindle and it keeps you entertained so you keep reading it. When I read this book, I couldn't put it down. The main charcter is a big trouble maker with lots of ideas. This book will remind you of a strict teacher and a student with a bad relationship. The kid thought if sombody can make up a word why couldn't he. 10 years later his word was in the dictonary.When his new word was old at his school it was new around the world.By, Jeremy and AJ from Springfield MN"
3,The not bad or good book,When I read the book it wasn't the best book it could've been. The good part was that as soon as the chapter was done you wanted to read on the feeling I love. I would like for you to read it though if you like to read a book in about 2 days because you wanted to read on. My favorite part was the end!
3,Can you make a word?,"This is a story boy named Nick. Who is in fifth grade and his new language Arts teacher Mrs. Ganger. The only language Arts teacher.Mrs. Ganger is mean but caring. Mrs. Ganger was to assign homework when Nick tried to stop her, but gets more. So he makes up a word for pen.Mrs. Ganger tries to stop him. Will she win? Find out when you read the book. I like this book becuse it has a lot of humorous events"
2,Frindle,"The book Frindle takee place in 7th period [english class]. The first day of school Nick tries to get out of work,and that is how it all started.I like how he made and stuck to his new word."
3,frindle,"I just read a great book called Frindle. Its about a kid an ordinary fifth grade kid who finds out that people can invent words at any age. So he gets a brilliant idea. He keeps calling a pen Frindle. Slowly it starts speading and people keep saying the word Frindle. His teacher and some other people like the word pen , so it's a battle to see who wins. Read the book to find out what happens! It shows how one little joke can turn into a big mess. However it has no action. And to me action is everything. That's why I rated it three stars. But if you like a nice school story read it! If you want a action packed shootem up book, don't read it."
3,Frindle,"The book is about this kid named Nicholas Allen. He is a fifth grader. He has a language arts teacher named Mrs.Granger. She always wants her kids to use a dictionary. She seems to be a nice teacher. One day Mrs.Granger had Nicholas do a report on the dictionary.So Nicholas gave a good report. When Nicholas was doing the report he found out this new word. Well if you want to know the new word,I guess you better read the book!"
2,"wasnt bad, wasnt good, it was horrible",I personaly wouldnt recomend reading frindle im mean it could have been a little bit longer and more exciting. I meanits about a pen! A PEN! I must say the cliff hangers were pretty good and it was kinda a game so i liked that to. Trust me if you read it i wouldnt think that you would think it. It wasnt the worst book in the world but who wants to read about a made up name for a pen a dinasour that came to life and you named it something differnt because ou didnt know what it was called for a science project or something but its a pen who wants to read about a pen! Im not saying that Andrew Clements is a bad author or anything im just saying its not the best book in the world but the Landry news is a great book so i would recommend reading that so just remember dont read frindle but read the landry news!
5,One of the best books EVER!!!!,"This is a story about a boy named Nick, who kids at his school know him for his stalling questions to get out of homework assignments. But one day, Nick & his friend, Janet are walking home from school. Nick decides that he should make a new word. So he said ""Here's your Frindle."" This sets off a chain reaction that soon, the world is using his word. My favorite part is at the end when his old teacher, Mrs. Granger (Who he thought hated the word Frindle) sent him a package with a dictionary. And the dictionary has Frindle in it!! This is a wonderful story that will make you want to sit down for hours at a time reading it. I know I did. This is probably the best book I have ever read! I hope you like it also."
3,Frindle,The book title is frindle. The authors name is Andrew Clements.The setting is at school in the language arts class. The two main characters are Nick Mrs.Granger.This book is about a new word frindle and Nick and Mrs.Granger at war.It all started when Nick had to do a report about how words are made.I would recomend this book because it is funny. It is funny because Nick and Mrs.Granger are usually arguing about the word frindle.
3,Okay in a good way and Bad in a bad way,"I think this book would be good for third and fourth graders. It would have been a little more exciting. I think that the book really didn't show the ending point. I liked the in the beginning, but not the ending. I think that if you read this book you might like it and maybe not."
3,pen+frindle+book=an okay book,I like the book and I dont like it because it has good jokes but it moves so fast and its so confusing at the same time because also it just moved so much in the years and ends with a few unanswered questions and i like it because of the jokes and the kids all agreeing to calling a pen frindle.
3,Pen Boy,The author of this book could have done a little better of writing the story. It should have been a littlemore exciting.But I still thought it was an okay book.The book got a little boring at the end it was not that great
3,not bad or great,When I read the book it wasn't as good as I excpected it to be. I didn't care for this book as much as some other books I've read because it just wasn't my style. I would recomend The Landry News instead.But my favorite part was the end.
3,A New Invented Word by A 5th grader,The book frindlewas a pretty good book but it was not the best.I liked it because there was a very clever 5th grader Nick Allen who came up with a new word and the book was also humorous. I did not like the book because it was not as exciting as I thought it would be and it was to easy.I recomend this book to 2-5 graders. The reason I gave the book 3 stars was because it was not the bebst book and it waaas better than I thought it was going to be.
3,The Great new Word,"I liked this story I thought it was ok, but not amazing. I like it because it was a little funny and I liked the part when he thought of the word frindle because I did not know that a fourth grader would think of that. I think it needed more exitment though."
1,Doesn't fit the product for which it was designed,"I have the Landware GoType keyboard for the Handspring, and I bought this case to protect the keyboard in my book bag. The case barely zips around the keyboard width-wise, and is longer than it needs to be. No matter which direction I insert the keyboard, it's a bad fit. The extra pockets are somewhat useless -- they are each designed to fit the Palm or Handspring, which is silly because why would you be carrying two PDAs at once? The extra padding designed to protect the PDA means that the compartments are smaller than they appear to be, so the most they can carry is maybe one cable or a backup module. The case is unattractive and essentially useless -- I plan to return mine."
2,Awkward... why not keep it simple?,"A small simple keyboard demands a small simple case. This is **NOT** it. The two pockets with Velcro closures should have been omitted. The whole idea of a PDA is that it can be put in a pocket where it's always handy -- and a keyboard (slim to start with) is the kind of thing that should fit into tiny crevices, much like a paperback book slides into a briefcase. The goofy pockets catch on everything, and make the case almost twice as thick. Also notice that they both face in the SAME direction. It is especially hard to put rigid items in the 'blind' pocket -- and to get them out -- unless the GoType has already been removed from the main compartment. I have thought about carefully cutting the pockets enirely off the case, but I have hesitated to do so... it seems such a drastic solution... -- This is a classic case of overdesign with inadequate forethought, and (I'm convinced) no field testing. --"
2,Where's the Gangsta part?,"I am not in anyway from the streets, but one thing I do know is a street story and all of these stories MISSED ME!I gave this book 2 stars for the cover. The cover is hot as H---!The stories are WACK!There isn't any thing in any of these stories that is SHOCKING HORRIFIC OR SCARY!Not to knock these gentlemen's hustle but none of the stories are live at all!"
5,A beautifully written album that still holds up today,"Why are people hatin' on the uptempo songs? Listen to the baseline on 'X's We Share' and tell me its not infectious. You can't, I know this. The ballads, I don't have to discuss because we all know each one is a classic, and if you didn't know, now you do. The whole album is a classic and will live on and on...forever."
3,Strong ballads offset by typical dance numbers,"In all fairness, Jodeci's 1991 debut album has aged quite well. It seems much more stylized (and realized) than most of today's half-thought R&B. The album is composed of two parts; the first five cuts being top-notch ballads expertly written & arranged by leader DeVante Swing. The second half of the album drifts into a well-meant assembly of dance numbers that doesn't stand up as well as the ballads. The dance tracks sound great by themselves but when they're shoved together at the back-end of the album they tend to sound the same (and they do). Perhaps if there were more ballads or if the dance numbers were mixed among the ballads it would hold up better.Even on this first album, K-C and JoJo prove early on that they are competent singers. The first five cuts are enough for me to keep the album."
4,My Favorite from them but there dance cuts were wack!,"this Album is a High 3&half to Me.the Fast Cuts stink&a running joke against buddys of mine is that Jodeci had that one decent Dance cut.the vocals here are tight.Devante along with Al B.Sure got a Solid Sound done.""Forever My Lady"",""Stay""&Come&Talk to me were My Jams off this Album.too Bad KC&Jo-JO have been stuck on Formula as Solo Artists&don't even come within a Mile of Sounding this Soulful much anymore."
4,"If you're an r&b fan, this cd is a must","This is definately the best album Jodeci put out over the years. With songs such as ""Come & Talk to Me"" and ""Stay"" "" any fan of r&b should have this cd in their collection. The last half dozen songs on the album are mediocre at best, most of those being more fast paced type of cuts. Jodeci never was and never will be a fast paced type of group, it's just not their thing. The slow jams are when they're at their best such as on ""stay"" and ""forever my lady."" If it weren't for the less than memorable last half of the cd, it would have gotten the full five stars."
5,This is still a classic to this day! Nice ballads!,"I'd get this album today if I wanted to, because this group just tore it up in '91 and much of '92 with songs from this debut! The three ballad hits, Forever My Lady (the jam!), Stay, and Come and Talk To Me have modern new jack touches, but are steeped in the classic R&B style of past groups. They were smart to place the smoother ballads first. The second half of the dance numbers are good; there are a few missteps, but the ballads still are the group's strongest suit. K-CI still is one of the best male singers from the '90s and it has helped in he and his brother's duo albums. The songs that Al B. Sure, Devante Swing and others produced on this album are very superb! Devante's songs stand out from many of the others! I hope that Jodeci considers recording a new album in the future. It would be another hit for them if they did it!"
3,Put tracks #1 to #5 on continuous repeat and u got 5 stars,"Jodeci's freshman album was a definite hit and it put these church boys from down south on the international map of secular music. However, Jodeci knows love songs not dance beats and fails in its efforts at upbeat tunes. If this cd was recordable, I would record over all songs after track #5. Even with the medicore and half-assed songs that fill the rest of the album. The love songs that greet you at the commencement of the CD are truly contemporary r&b classics."
5,jodeci forever my lady,great first album love all the songs the whole album very talented group of brothers im glade iwaited to replace this cd one of the greatest groups in the 1990s talented group of brothers
3,Jodeci's Debut,"This album was pretty worthwile---just the first 5 songs. I don't know why this band relented after that to some uptempo trash, but at least the CD keeps your interest for a little while. ""Stay"" is a strong hit that brings out pleas to someone to not leave. ""Come and Talk to Me"" is a flirting song that also went to #1. Then, you have ""Forever My Lady,"" with its affection and togetherness-theme. Of course that went #1. ""I'm Still Waiting"" reveals a bit of impatience with the vocals growing strong. ""U and I"" is the last number you should listen to, and then after that, unless you can tolerate a rhythm change in an album, cut it off or have restart button in effect."
3,Jodeci Began on A Good Note...,"Jodeci's ""Forever My Lady"" was okay. Once again if Jodeci had just stuck to the slow songs, this album wouldn't have been that bad. Secondly, the release date for this album is pretty confusing! They say the album was released on May 28, 1991, but didn't first appear on the Billboard 200 until October 1991! What's up with that?!? My three favorites are ""Come & Talk To Me"" , ""U&I"", and ""Interlude (553-Nasty)."""
3,Strong ballads followed by weak dance songs 3 1/2 stars,"It's funny but usually most groups nowadays have strong dance tunes and weak ballads but for Jodeci on their debut album it was the other way around. The album starts very strong with ballads like Stay and come and talk to me. The rest of the ""slow side "" of the first side of the album is every bit as good as the first two songs. If Jodeci had released this as an EP this would be a classic. But unfortunately theres a ""fast side"" which is weak. No good beats, no good songs, just plain ordinary. Nothing on the fast side stands out not even a little bit. All in all on the strength of the first five songs this is still a very good debut from one of the first (and best) of the `bad boy` bands. If you avoid the last 6 songs you'll love this album"
3,NotThatBad,"There is no doubt that KCi and Jo Jo possess fantastic tenor voices; and their debut album does well to showcase their considerable talent in the vocal department. Unfortunately it also highlights their mediocre song writing abilities. Their songs consist of one or two chords, meaningless lyrics, and endless streams of vocal calisthenics. Even Jo Jo cant breathe life into these tunes.That said, two songs are memorable. ""U and I"" and ""Stay"" are as simple in their construction as any of the tunes on Forever My Lady, but are saved from mediocrity by some great synth chops and tasteful vocal adlibs. It probably didn't help that Al B Sure had a hand in this albums production, Forever My Lady sounds like Al B Sures debut except KCi and Jo Jo can sing. So in all I rate this album three stars; two for each of the good songs on the album, and one for releasing a ""new-jack-swing-era-album"" not produced by Teddy Riley, Babyface, or Griffin."
5,stars are born.,"jodeci just makes some of the greatest slow jams there is. I was only 12 when this album came out and it had a big impact on me. First of all, forever my lady was always on the radio, come & talk to me related to me having crushes on diffrent girls in school. I definitely fell in love with this album from beginning to end. Whether it was stay, or alright, gotta love or U&I. This kicked off the 90's right."
5,R&B AT ITS BEST,JODECI REMINDS ME OF THE KIND OF MUSIC I GREW UP LISTENING TO....OUT OF ALL THEIR CD'S THIS ONE BY FAR THE BESTGREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com
5,jodeci at it's best,Jodeci is a Mad Band! Get this and all the rest of their CD'S. They are guaranteed to be HOT!
2,Outdated.,"I got this book just because it is considered by some to be the best on the subject.It was first published in 1991 and the last print was in 2002.Maybe it was an excellent book for the time it was first published, but it looks pretty much outdated today.Includes many color photos, but also many sketches that are not helpful at all.I noticed that there is only one photograph of a tropical passion flower!There is also a problem with the names of certain species that have changed, as the old names are used.Search for more recent publications on the subject."
1,Eeek! This smells awful!!,"Seriously, this smells like urine - or better yet a port-a-potty at an aAugust state fair with unprecedented attendance and equally hot temperatures.Returning immediately!"
1,Never Received,This item was ordered with two other products. Apparently all came from different sources. Two were received but this one was marked as in-transit for two weeks. I finally decided to email the company about my missing body powder and they just said they would refund my money. My complaint is would they have refunded my money without my contact email? I will not order from this supplier again.I gave this product one star simply because I had to enter something.
5,Dusting powder with pleasant fragrance,I had used this product many years ago and rediscovered it recently. It is just as pleasant smelling as I remember from years ago. The powder is soft and smooth. Dries area being covered with the powder. Very pleased with product.
3,Stranger Than Real Life,Whoever said truth is stranger than fiction didn't read this book. I'm glad I stuck with it to the end to see it come together but what a strange trip it was.
5,A great modern satire,"This is an intresting story of a wrestler's quest to find his own identity. The witinging is both brilliant and funny. Dobyns writes his book depicting the views and philosophies of Fredrick Nietzche through the wacked out characters of 20th century ""professional wrestling"" This book will make you better examine our society and perhaps the question why now in 1999,professional wrestling is becoming so popular."
3,Life on the Sidewalk,"Just Rambling Along, 1918 filmThere is a dispute over a wallet on the sidewalk that is settled by a policeman. A woman walks by and attracts a crowd of men - to a restaurant. Stan tastes the soup and the roast fowl, then pie. But he only pays for the coffee. [You have got to see this!] There is a surprise at the cash register. [Note the manufacturer of this cash register.] Stan is caught by the cook and waiter, and thrown out the door. He is greeted by that policemen seen earlier who is looking for him.Stan Laurel had a lengthy stage career before Hal Roach hired him in 1918 to replace another comedian. His comedic style was different from the 1920s."
1,This is one of the meanest user-unfriendly softwares ever,"I am above-average in ability to set up software.But this --Setup was difficult.Finally got that done and functional.Rocked along a while and all was well.Then out of the blue, something went haywire just in time to have missed the chance for free tech support.Hours and hours and hours and hours passed, wrangling with it. (And more hours)Finally gave up.Then went to uninstall it.Should have been simple - In Windows, go to Control Panel, Programs, Uninstall.But oh no.Computer said uninstall was not completed.No matter how I tried, never could wrench QuickBooks' tendrils' grips from my business' computers.Useless perpetual major pain in the derriere."
4,Glad I replaced Peachtree with Quickbooks,"Good small business accounting package overall. Much more user friendly than Peachtree. Memorized transactions work OK but could use additional improvement in better automating repeat monthly billing. Quickbooks would also benefit from some of Quicken's automatic on-line bank account synchronization features and would like to have the ""undo"" feature provided in Quicken."
1,The designers of this bloatware should be SHOT,"This has to be the absolute worst software I have ever seen in my life.It is so slow as to be unusable - wait 2 minutes from clicking to start the software until the first screen shows. Granted, this is not a brand new computer, but it's XP-Pro that does a reasonable job on any other software. Even with brand new FAST computers this software is slow and kludgy.The way multiuser is implemented is unreliable and unintuitive.Being the one to support the computers at company who decided to upgrade to this version, I wish I could find the idiots who designed this and make sure they never write any software for anyone ever again."
3,"Short, mildly entertaining reading.","What kind of book would you get if you squished Aldiss' Heliconia Series, ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" and Orwell's ""1984""? Enemies Of The System could serve as a preface to it. It's short, leaves a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions - yet dialogs and discussions are engaging, scenery might tickle imagination, ending is somewhat surprising. Philosophical context and questions it tries to pose are dated - world is mighty changed since the eighties. Decent five to six hours of reading if you have nothing better to do."
5,Transforming Our Worldview,James Boice does a terrific job in explaining the needed transformation of the Christian's mind. He explains the why we should want to be transformed and what we are to be transformed from and into. He does a great job of defining a worldly view of life and how to obtain a biblical view of life. He is up front and accurately protrays reality with documentation. Our churches need this teaching! Recommended.
3,For Camp Lovers,"A satisfying movie for fans of the camp horror genre. The film, Zombies Vs Strippers, combines slap-stick humor with much wanted fanservice from both its sassy heroines and from its living dead. The ladies, especially Brittany Vaughn's character, Vanilla, have some great zombie-ass kicking moments, spiced up with sexy poledancing and strip-teases. And no zombie apocalypse movie is complete without some good old-fashion zombie gore and ""brains"" hungering."
2,Brains!,"This movie has a lot of the old style gore with basic body props and no CGI effects. So, if you like that, you should watch it. The zombies yell out brains a lot. There's the basic idea of being bite by a zombie makes you turn into one here. There a lot of slap stick humor in this one. I didn't really like the fact that every one character seemed too stupid and felt that they are all going to die because of their stupidity, but I guess that's what B movies are. lolThe truth is I thought the strippers would be much prettier and sexier too, but they aren't and I didn't like that. I give this movie 2 stars and would had got 3, if they had better looking girls."
3,"Zombies and Hooters, whats not to like?","Take this movie for what it is, cheap thrills for the zombie-hooter lovers amongst us. Although the academy won't come knockin' on the door of this movie, it is an excellent example of a drive-in, ""B,"" movie."
4,I liked it,"Zombies vs. Strippers isn't the best entry in the whole versus series of zombies. But, surprisingly enough, I was entertained by it. The pacing is good and there are actually some funny moments in it. And the strippers aren't that bad either."
2,not the most informative map,"really not the move informative map that I've gotten from Trails Illustrated. National Parks maps are almost just as good. Totally unnecessary. Since there aren't that many trails on Mt. Desert Island, park map will suffice. I wouldn't buy it again. A far cry from the Yosemite and Joshua Tree maps. Would not purchase again."
4,For anyone who cant get it to work on XP,"Hello. I have played the demo for this game and it seems fun exept for the controls. The graphics are great. Anyway, for anyone who cant get the sound to work, read on. About a month ago I bought Half Life for the PC, and it had a problem with XP. All I did was find Half Life's icon, right clicked it and clicked properties, clicked compatibility and changed it to Windows 98 mode and pressed okay. Since then, Half Life has been working fine. If it worked with other games with XP problems, it may work for tomb raider."
5,This game rocks!,"I played demos for several different Tomb Raider games, but before long, it was clear that Tomb Raider 2 is the game for me. It is so awesome! I love the plot about the crazed cultists of the Fiama Nera under the leadership of the delightfully mad Marco Bartoli. And it isn't really all that hard. I would reccommend this game to anyone; it's so much fun! I haven't played the extra levels yet, but they're sure to be great! I only have two complaints: 1. whoever designed that spider cave sequence in the Dagger of Xian level should be shot! It gave me temporary arachniphobia! 2. I wish you didn't have to kill Marco at the end, he's the most awesome Tomb Raider badguy. Eidos should take a hint and resurrect him somehow."
1,Beware XP users,"This is no doubt a great game, one of the best ever but it has a number of problems running on Windows XP. For me, the music would not play."
5,Magical,This stuff works magically! It's the only thing that worked for me. I literally had fresh red stretch marks that were starting to develope and used this stuff EVERDAY until my stretch marks disappeared. It's just to bad that they don't sell this in stores anymore. I'm soo grateful to have found this product after searching for it for many years!
1,Stupidest game ever!!!,"This game is SO BAD! I came here to look at the reviews expecting to see many, many other bad reviews. I was SHOCKED to see so many wonderful reviews for this piece of garbage. I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This game isn't even worth giving away! It's going in my garbage."
1,Consider this first....,"There is no clear objective for each turn. The things the game asks the players to do aren't fun or funny. I think this might be a good game for 11-14 yr. olds. We had a group of 8 people playing ranging from 12 to 50 and the 12 yr old found it enjoyable. The rest found it painful, slow and disappointing in every way. Really expensive when you consider the outcome. A cheaper way to the same outcome would be to write down ridiculous things for your neighbor to do and pass them around the table. Really...it's that stupid."
2,Nowhere near!,"This game is nowhere near as fun as my family and I expected it to be!With all the great reviews for it around here, we thought we would be laughing and playing well into the night.First of all, I spent the entire game with my hand on the floor, so I wasn't even with my family at the table (that sucked).Second of all, it really didn't last all that long.Thirdly, the game moves at a snail's pace--which brings up the question, how in the world can the game move so slowly but go by so fast?(I still haven't figured that one out!)Lastly, it just didn't seem to be that well thought out.Not that much fun.For lots of fun and for a game that lasts a long, long, time play Redneck Life Game; it's a blast!"
5,I see a storm coming,"This game has so many layers of fun from the stupid physical rules to writing poems etc. This game is not too trivia centered (so a wide group of people can enjoy). We laughed so much that, we had to stop playing. We could not laugh any more as our stomachs where hurting. After many days of playing we still use the jokes from the game when we talk."
3,"Very fun, but gets old fast","This game is a super fun party game. It really gets people to open up and be crazy. That said, it also gets old fast. You can only play it about twice with the same group of friends before it just gets too repetitive. I played it a bunch for the first two weeks, and then we haven't touched it for over two years."
4,It,"I think that this game is a lot of fun, just don't choose 1-day shipping that is ""free"". They charged $20 and I got it four days later."
1,Too far out for us!,"Four professionals, mother,father, son, and daughter-in-law played this. Everyone has either a state license, one or two masters degree and a PhD. This game was just ridiculous. We put forth every effort to have fun with it, but it wasn't funny, and we saw no educational value so we cannot honestly recommend it at all. Shipping good"
1,"Great expectations, but this was a dud.","I love games, particularly party games, and I belong to a group that meets once a month just to play games. I bought this game thinking it would be a hoot for our game night group, particularly given the high ratings. We played it once, and I gave it away to charity. The activities dictated by the game are just stupid and pointless. In a group of a dozen people (many of whom were drinking and should have been able to enjoy any silly thing), nobody understood what was supposed to be funny or enjoyable. It you want a fun game with silly activities that will have everyone rolling on the floor, try Would You Rather. If you want something with a competitive edge that's still fun and gets everybody laughing, Cranium can't be beat. Quelf is just a dud all around."
5,HILARIOUS!!!,"Quelf is absolutely amazing! As a college student that hates games I was on my back holding my side because I was laughing so much. It seems like it would be a very fast and short game but it took us a while to get to the finish line. Hilarious activities and actions have to be performed by this game. I recommend this game to any one who is wanting to have a fun evening, families, college students, couples. Just play it. Trust me you wont regret it."
4,A WWII adventure book series.,The Author has set this adventure series during the WWII era. This particular book was the first in the series. Interesting reading about two teen agers and their adventures.
2,Bison Designs Rasta Adjustable Nylon Dog Collar,"This collar (size S) is too bulky and overwhelming for a small dog. And the colors are not as vibrant as in the picture. This collar should not be made for small dogs. As a large-dog collar, it would be great."
5,Just Awsome,"At first when I first bought this CD I was somewhat disappointed. But after listening to it more I grasped it more and more. I especially like ""Vide Infra"" and ""Rise Inside"" given the melody and the meaning of each song. Then the heavy metal, I thought Fear Factory was metal but now it's a glimpse of the past. I can't wait for another CD from them. I have high hopes for this band. BUY THIS CD. You won't regret it."
5,sweet !,A must have for any metal fan. I listen to it everyday and still havent gotten enough after the last 3 months of listening!
5,All that could have been . . .,"The only reason I'm reviewing this is too add a five star rating; this album deserves five stars. I don't think, after Jesse's departure, that there will ever be a KsE album (or any other metalcore album) that can match the perfection of this one."
5,Excellent CD even better than EoH,"I wrote a review of End of Heartache before fully listening to this one and I have to say after equal amounts of time in my player, while EoH is great, I like this one even more. I don't know what it is but it seems that on the whole the songs are more solidly working together and likeable than on EoH. So whereas I would give EoH 4.5 stars, I would give this one 5 stars. Not much else to say given all the other reviews."
3,Not as good as ''The End Of Heartache'' but still good.,I love KSE. ''My Last Serenade'' is my favorate song on here. ''Fixation on the Darkness'' is also good. i suggest you get this along with there new cd if you like metal/hardcore
5,A Truly Great Album..,"Killswitch Engage is one of the most talented heavy bands existing right now. This album has what can be called the perfect mixture of heaviness and melody. They can go from almost a brutal death style sound to wonderful melody and singing from lead vocalist Howard Jones. This is truly the new generation of metal. This album flows extremely well from beginning to end, without standout tracks throughout this record. This has to be one of the most emotional and powerful indicators that heavy music is alive,well, and poised to destroy the new millenium."
5,A great metal sound.,"I picked up this album on the strength of the single Life to Lifeless. The whole album is incredible. The first 5 songs are probably the best, but there are gems elsewhere as well. For example, track 6 starts off pretty fast and heavy and it sounds like just a bang your head song. Then midway through the song, there is a clean vocal chorus ""I...have been wai-ting..for you"" spoken in a voice with alot of reverb and choral effect. Its incredible. And you can't help but sing along to the chorus of track 2. So this album is definitely worthy. That said, the singer on this album is no longer with the band, but from what I have read, the new singer is doing a good job of capturing the same sound. I hope the next album will be even better."
5,Very surprising,"Wow...now I have a new favorite band. This album is simply catchy and well done, and downright amazing. From the catchy churning guitars, to the hard to soft voice, it all adds up to one must-have album. Now this band has talent. Make sure you pick up this cd, you won't be disappointed."
4,AWESOME,"I first heard this group on the 2002 Warped Tour cd and I thought they were great. This group was actually one of my first favorite groups I had.This cd is a great album with awesome vocals, great drumming, and guitar. For the 12 songs more then half are great. I recommend you buy this if you're a fan of Hatebreed. This is better then there last album, but I think there new album coming out May 11 will be awesome with their brand new singer. The song ""Fixation on the Darkness"" was featured on the MTV2 Headbangers Ball cd.Tracks:1-Numbered Days-9/102-Self Revolution-8/103-Fixation on the Darkness-9/104-My Last Serenade-10/105-Life to Lifeless-8/106-Just Barely Breathing-7/107-To the Sons of Man-8/108-Temple from Within-9/109-The Element of One-9/1010-Vide Infra-10/1011-Without a Name (solo)-8/1012-Rise Inside-10/10"
3,A Decent Metal Album,"Killswitch Engage isn't going to win any awards or anything for this, but it is at least worth looking into. The band itself is pretty good, a little repepetive at times, but the great drumwork makes up for it. My biggest pet peeve with this band is its lack of originality. I was hoping that maybe I could find something I had not heard before, but was disappointed. Oh well, no big deal. Killswitch sounds most like Nothingface, Superjoint Ritual, and Pantera. At least thats who comes to mind when I hear it. Hope you found this useful."
2,ugh!,nothing extremly amazing about this album. drummer coud try using his sticks a little instead of just heavy double bass. guitars emulate eachother and create nothing special. screaming seems to lack feeling and sincerity. bass guitar is nowhere to be found like my pulse while i tortured myself to this all the way home from the record shop.
2,hearing this cd feels Kind of gay.....,Better than their new album(there new album just blows!). But it still realy doesn't apeal to me. Fans of unearth and atreyu might find something they like here but fans of brutal music or fans of heavy metal probably wont be able to tolerate this music.
1,"ferrets are cute, roadrunner sucks","i love the self titled release on ferret records, but i hate the rest on roadrunner records. i was betrayed when i purchased alive or just breathing, when i found that not only the band had been pussified, but 2 of the tracks on the self titled release had been re-recorded and pussified as well. i love screaming, and hate harmonized choruses and uninspired melodies. i find now that i am too metal for KSE. a damn shame."
2,MEH,"My friend let me borrow this album along with Between The Buried and Me's first album and Converge: Jane Doe.FIRST OFF: THE OPENING RIFFS IN ""MY LAST SERENADE"" WERE STOLEN FROM SLAYER'S ""GHOST OF WAR"" FROM THE ALBUM SOUTH OF HEAVEN... minus the double bass... I'm surprised nobody pointed that out yet...I didn't catch on with this band nor did I enjoy this album. There's just something about them that I don't like. It's probably because music like this has already been done before and there really isn't anything 'great' or 'new' about the type of music on this album.If you've never listened to any of Metallica's older stuff, Slayer, and Hatebreed, you're probably gonna think this stuff is amazing. If you want good HEAVY metal pick up every older Slayer (their new stuff is ok too) and Metallica albums. Other great alternatives are Lamb Of God, Converge, Between The Buried and Me, The Red Chord."
1,"RANCID, DOG $H!T","HOW THE HELL CAN YOU CALL THIS MUSIC?, IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE 99% OF ALL OF THE OTHER CRAP NUMETAL BANDS AROUND. THIS TYPE OF MUSIC SHOULD BE ABOLISHED. HAIL TO THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,AWESOME,"I saw these guys at Ozzfest over the summer and they were AMAZING!!They are heavy, but the singer can also sing. This is a great Cd. If you like rock music then u will enjoy this!"
5,ALBUM OF THE YEAR!,"You want to hear some dynamic vocals plus extreme guitar riffs that cut through your soul like bread through butter? Then check out Killswitch Engage's ""Alive or Just Breathing"". This album has it all. It is amazing what this band has done with the genre. Screaming to singing - it just makes sense. The hardcore beats mix in well with the vocals of Jesse. You won't see this stuff coming from your MTV crowd. This is all out hard. Full throttle metal."
4,Metalcore Worth a Damn,"I'm going to be brief here. This album served as a gateway into the metal genre for me many years ago. Once I moved on to other bands, I left this album in the dust. Out of random curiousity, I had the urge to listen to some of these songs again to see how good it still is. I'm happy to say it's held up rather well. This album's strong points are mainly its energy level and passionate playing. The riffs balance heaviness and melody admirably, and the vocalist at the time of this recording is much better than the vocalist that took over after him. It's safe to say that this band has never produced anything more worthwhile than this. This serves as evidence that metalcore can (or could, at least) actually be a strong vehicle for new music."
5,You need this!,"If you love metal, especially anything underground/hardcore, you need Killswitch. They have truly brought the meaning of hardcore to the metal scene.Everything by Killswitch Engage is very, well, ""engaging,"" and magnificently sweet, but Alive Or Just Breathing is another story. Not only is it sweet, but when you listen to it, the raw furiousness of the music will make you want to head-bang until your freaking head flies off.My favorite tracks on the album would certainly have to be My Last Serenade and Fixation on the Darkness. Although the rest of the songs are excellent as well, these two songs posess an almost spell-binding quality.I recommend this cd to any metal junkie out there. Before I first heard this, I had no idea. The lastest Killswitch cd doesn't even measure up to it, I'm afraid. So you need to buy this amazing cd. It will change your life for the better :D"
1,Timmy is a ****ing moron!!!,"""Swearing is bad no matter how it is used."" How would oy uknow, you didn't write the song! SMH likes PLENTY of bands w/o cursing, like Black Sabbath, Dream Theater, Mastodon, Opeth, Arch Enemy, etc. but not swearing to ""be safe"" proves they're idiots. Also, SHM doesn't give a rat's ass about being ""cool"", in fact, he's anti-mainstream! Go wallow yourself in shame for being a blind fool!Back to Killsuck Engage, I agree with SHM. KSE is a horrible talentless metalcore band. They need breakdowns to make ""heavy"" music. For good music, just listen to any band SMH wrote down.Long live Lamb of God!Death to Killswitch Engage!"
5,Excellent,"I started with the second volume, The Mammoth Book of More Historical Whodunnits, and enjoyed it so much that I went out and got a copy of this one as well. I really liked the time-span of story settings, and the best part was the mystery that was written down over 2000 years ago!Great for people who like short story mysteries, and as a lead-in to authors you might like."
2,Mammoth Book of Who Can Plow Through It,"OK, I know people will disagree with me, but this book became unbearable somewhere in the middle & I just gave up by the time I was 3/4's done. Historical mysteries are pretty tiresome if they are not extremely well-written & there are a few very good ones in here, but they drown in the mediocrity of the rest of the stories. How many various time periods can you honestly claim to have believable detectives working when oftentimes the culture & history of the period would make it completely impossible for anyone to be a Holmes-like figure? It's just too hard to suspend my disbelief long enough to get into the stories & most of them are so simplistic & easy to solve that you can turn to the end to confirm your guess & then move on to the next story. If you're into this genre, go for it, but otherwise, pace out the stories over a long period of time to avoid burnout & try not to let the crummy ones ruin the good ones for you."
2,"subtly, dreamily disappointing","I read N.P. and was impressed by the thoughts, careful translation, and almost campy combination of subject matter (lesbians, incest, suicide, etc.). Asleep touches on some of this, but somehow without developing a single memorable character. I read and read and lost interest with every page. B.Y. gets hung up on the main characters' man problems, and after a while it just isn't engaging to read about how sleepy she is, or how weird her dreams are."
4,Dreams inside cocoons of silence.,"These three novellas, written early in Yoshimoto's career, share the theme of sleep as a refuge and an escape. In each story, all told in first-person, a young woman moves from her sleep-cocooned state to walk the liminal space between her life and the death of someone close to her.Although the translation is a little harsh at times, and doesn't always catch Yoshimoto's ambiguous, moonlit tone, this book is a welcome escape from reality into the silence and uncertainty of night."
2,Asleep is a VERY fitting title...,"Well what can I say about this book? Sadly, not much... there is not much substance in here... style, yes... but substance no. The three stories go along very slowly and never really develop into anything. Part of Banana's writing reminds me much of Haruki... but sadly the parts of Haruki she utilizes do not combine into a good book like The Elephant Vanishes. If you want to read some short stories that dont seem to go anywhere but do have substance... AND MAKE YOU THINK... read something of Haruki. Many have said Kitchen is an excellent book but this one falls way short of being good... its just plain boring. Ultimately, go with Elephant Vanishes for short stories... or even The Cape by Nakagami... and if you want a longer and extremely twisted read, go with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which has much more depth and substance than Asleep can ever DREAM to have. South of the Border, West of the Sun is also very good if you want a shorter Haruki book."
3,"Interesting stories, but...","The stories are interesting, especially the last one called ""Asleep,"" but the translation is not the best. I often found myself wondering what the author might have really meant."
1,"Should have been a politican, fence straddler","This book looks down on Commision E in Germany as though it were a third world county, disregards all their careful research and conclusions. Also states that since we do not have standardize herbs in the U.S he couldn't recommend an effictive amount to be used. Don't throw away your money on this book."
4,xmas paintball,Product was delivered on time and with all items specified in the description. My son was very happy.
1,beware---these are junk!,I bought one off the web (July '06) and it kicked off every three minutes. They sent me a replacement---it ran longer but didn't cool at all and was NOISY (the seller told me 46db on their website but this was louder than my 5 year old window unit). I sent that one back too and then got nicked $50 for return shipping. Avoid this unit.
1,"bad price, bad quality, bad support","besides the high price, my monitor would not turn on. after hours of trying to talk to a human being, i finaly reached someone, and was disconected. it took over a week to get through to them and know how to fix my monitor. i don't recomend anything that has ""SONY"" written on it"
1,"too big, poor quality","Even though I have never worn it in the shower or pool, in 6 months the chronograph dial came out."
4,Cool Watch,"I hesitate to buy clothing or apparel type items online, because you don't know how it will look in real life. However, I am totally pleased with this watch. It is as ""cool"" as it looks in the picture. It has a large face and case, which is what I wanted, and what it looked like in the picture. With the black band, you can be sure it will fit (as I have a thin wrist, and the metal type bands are usually too large for me.) It looks really good, and it has kept perfect time, including the date, since I purchased it. I would totally recommend it."
1,100 Pages Too Long,"Brian J. Bailey's The Luddite Rebellion, it seems now, was doomed from the start. The tale of the Luddites, those impoverished English hosiery workers who smashed machines in the 1800s, does not merit a whole book. The primary material on the topic is quickly exhuasted, and what is left are drawn-out discussions on whether the machine-smashers were politically motivated or not, and the ins and outs of a few insignificant trials. In addition, Bailey's more emotional outbursts against capitalist exploitation only detract from the seriousness of the work."
1,Didn't even need this...,"This product is currently sitting on top of my refrigerator...unopened. It is there because the screen I puchased on here also is hanging by the screwed hooks it CAME WITH. If you decide to buy the brackets, be sure you are prepared to purchase screws to hang them because they don't come with it. It comes with the brackets and the hooks for the screen...thats it. I will keep the brackets for future use if needed but I wish I had known I didn't need them to hang my screen. I would have saved my money."
2,Wall mounts for projector screen,Was a little disappointed that I had to buy the bolts to put these up.I didn't end up using them. I just mounted my screen directly to the wall.
3,Missing hardware?,The support were strong and enabled the 70in screen to be mounted and clear the curtain rods in our living room. Easy to put up and use. The downside is that it does not come with any mounting screws or anything. It took me some time to find the right screws to use and appropriate washers. Unless you can screw into wood studs you need to get some screw in fastners with about a 3inch screw.
2,Brackets are plastic,"Being that these brackets are only 6 inches long, and about 1 inch square in cross-section, I thought they would be quite strong. However, what I did not find specified was that the brackets are actually plastic. I used two brackets to hang a screen which Da-lite claims is almost exactly 75 pounds and these brackets began to sag, so I did not use them. I think they should have a lower weight rating."
5,Fantastic!,These are the episodes I could never find. They had me laughing out loud from start to finish.
2,Total Fraud,This album is all acoustic. Nothing of the classic christian hard rock band of the 70's. If you like overdriven guitars and a solid electric band don't purchase this record because you will waste your money.
5,a classic!,"i think that this is the best x-men graphic novel i have ever read! it's very interesting, humorous at just the right times, and action-packed! i've re-read this book many times and it's always great! very entertaining! i recommend this book for any x-men or comic book fan. it's also great for newcomers because it's not confusing about past events."
2,Inferno did not burn very hot for me,"Inferno is not very interesting to someone who was relatively new to the X-verse (namely myself). It had follow-ons from many plot lines (Phoenix Saga, Colossus' little sister being in hell and infected with the Legacy virus, etc.) which I did not quite follow. Of course, a true X-men follower would have collected and read all the preceding comics and known the plots and subplots being discussed. My recommendations for a newbie: get the X-men novels ( i.e. Gamma Quest trilogy, GenX Crossroads, etc.) -- they generally explain each character's history a little better."
2,Not up to Standards,"This book, while having some redeeming qualities, is hard to swallow, particularly in the characterizations. Golden has a real problem with the differences between men and women. All of her male characters are women with slightly different chromosomes. Read the other books first"
3,The Murdered Sun,"The overall book is not bad. Of course this is the last book to be set during ST Voy's season 1. The ideal of warring races clashing aganist each other (and being related) is an interesting plot twist. This is also not the first time Voyager will encoutner reptile-dinosuar like creatures in the DQ. Overall it was a good story- the promise of a wormwhole, with a linkage to a far away planet (but not the Alpha Quadrant) is not that bad."
4,"Nice reading, goes down well...","Certainly not the best Voyager book I've ever read, but very good none the less... Really great story that follows Gene Roddenberrys visions of human tollerance. Give it a read, it is certainly worth you while, I really enjoyed it..."
4,Good but too descriptive...:),"I liked the book but it was kind of unrealistic because it started from the end other season 1 and I had alredy seen 4 episodes of season 2 so it seem way off. I like the books that are about episodes of the show and not origanal. It was good though. It's hard to read it kind of because I got kinda bored when they desribe everything so deeply. All in all, a good book."
4,"Photography oriented History of unbelievable,Shocking outcome of Excellent Pilots & their Crews in Europe & Pacific Theater !","Admirable,excellent Author OF Photogrphy-Historyoriented Military Aviation Researcher who made2 volumes of unexpectly developing,shocking accidrntsof USAF and USN'S Pilots and their Crews.they are alwasysdream back Home for their waiting Lovly Families.If they falling into loose concentrations through whicunavidable,tragic accident developed.This Book cover on Various Aircrats involved various ShockingAccidents. This BOOKS is Recommenable from Bigginer to Mania !"
2,Disappointing,"This audio CD seemed more like someone reading the Statistical Abstract of the United States than an insightful critique of industrial political establishment. Mr. Dobbs presents way too many facts that become tiresome after awhile. On the plus side, Dobbs makes his positions unequivocal but every chapter seems nothing more than a regurgitation of the previous chapter's points. The entire thrust of the CD was succinctly summarized in his introduction and I should have stopped there."
1,More of his usual garbage.,"Seen his show? Then you don't need to read his book. Lou Dodds is a heartless man. People like him are the reason the rest of the world hates America.The middle class want to make as much as their bosses while not doing as much work or taking as much risk (IE starting own business) and the government is so greedy with the taxes it is no wonder that companies are forced to go to other countries just to make a profit.Lou is also a racist. Have you noticed that he doesn't seem to give a damn about other countries, especially Mexico? Lou, we can't have everything and let them have nothing and not expect them to come here. They have nothing to lose. Now, I'm all for border security but Dodd's idea of just putting up a fence and letting them all die is heartless. We must help these people clean up their country and give them a better life so that they don't have to sneak across the border.Edited to add: What is the problem folks? Don't like the truth."
1,My Father Gained His Job,"Happy MLK day. Glad to see that such xenophobic schlock is selling so well on amazon despite the work of Dr. King. Sure, it's convenient to blame immigration and free trade for problems of the middle class, but it's just not true. Any rational economist will tell you that free trade benefits both parties. Yes, some simple jobs in America are bound to be exported. Yes, this will cause some pain and hardship for many. These are the costs of free trade. The government should use some of the gains from trade to provide training for those who are layed off. I apologize to those who do not understand this most basic economic principle. But please, Mr. Dobbs, continue your crusade for the middle class...just don't let it interfere with tea, mint juleps, golf, and horse shows at your residence in Palm Beach."
5,Middle class is the target......,"Lou tells it like it is, if you doubt it read the book !Middle class will be an extinct species......"
4,Eye Opening,I thought this brought to light the realization that America is only about one color.......green!
5,Lou Dobbs fans ...,Purchased book for my husband who is a Dobbs fan - he loved it and the ideas/issues presented.
1,Couldn't finish it,"Having read some other books related to this subject, I was disappointed by this one. In fact, I didn't finish it. Though Dobbs could support all his points with history and numbers (lots of numbers!), there was nothing in it that anyone who's read the newspaper wouldn't know. What should have been a passionate subject was dryly reported at an arm's length."
3,My Dad Lost His Job,"My father, N. Gregory Mankiw, lost his job due to offshoring. Even though my father is a big fan of free trade and outsourcing, I think it is horrible. We no longer have a cushy faculty home and apparently all the jobs in Washington are also being exported. We have to eat macaroni and cheese for most meals. I am scared, but Mr. Dobbs' book made me feel okay. I only gave the book 3 stars because it does defy the basic economic tenets, which are agreed upon by EVERY economist in the world."
2,What is it Good For? Absolutely Nothing!,"I loved The War on the Middle Class. For two weeks, I wouldn't leave my house unless I was wearing full military regalia. That's how real I thought the war on the middle class was. Then I thought about it and realized that there is no conspiracy against the middle class, only a rich white guy with a degree from Harvard who wants us to think there is one. In this poorly researched, xenophobic, racist, book, Dobbs once again takes the mantle as the ""champion of the middle class."" While Dobbs hopes to mobilize his own army of ""middle class warriors"" (page 83), we should not let him. We must thwart his plans to be ruler of the US! Do not take up arms in battle, fellow members of the middle class! Dobbs is not your leader!"
5,War on the Middle Class,This book is excellent and a must read for anyone who is going to vote in the 2008 elections. Lou Dobbs provides the reader with ample information on the current state of our nation. His views on the status of the middle class give us a lot to ponder as we look towards our nation's future.Nick Simzak
3,Good but short on solutions,Lou did a good job identifying the bandits but was short on solutions. The book is a good read and really makes you angry. I say throw the bums out.
4,a great read for every american,"A great cobination of how the government, large corporation, lobbyist and other parties are using the political system and basic economics to hurt the middle class."
3,The War rages on,"The War is something everyone needs to hear about. Lou Dobbs could spend less time promoting his show and more time spelling out the mechanics of ""How to Fight Back."""
4,This was a wake-up call for me,"This book was scarier than any Stephen King novel. I knew that Washington DC was out of touch with everyday citizens, but I was not aware of how deep pockets can make our elected representatives forget who elected them in the first place. Money really does talk, and if you don't have a lot of it, then it is unlikely the US government cares what you have to say. I have been seeing the gap widen between the rich and the poor with my own eyes as I am in the middle class but my brother is a consultant for a high profile firm on the West coast. He gets a lot of tax breaks for investments and gets to stop paying social security taxes after he hits the $90,000 mark every year. I barely have any money to save, much less invest. Read this book, and then check out Lou's show Lou Dobbs Tonight on CNN."
1,A shallow examination with a tabloid mentality,"It is seldom that I consider returning a book to a store because it is simply awful. This one was tempting. The topic is an excellent and intriguing one: Tibetan teachers being reborn in the West. However there is apparently not a lot to say on the subject as she drags in a variety of unrelated parapsychological material on reincarnation in order to pad the measly amount she actually writes on the tulkus. Her style is awful. She talks down to her audience and takes a ""Gee Whiz!"" mentality towards the whole subject that left me wondering if she was truly impressed with the tulkus or so disbelieving that she was making fun of them by overstatement. Unfortunately this is the only book on this subject that I am aware of, so I can't point elsewhere, but this one may be worse than nothing"
4,Transaction satisfaction,The product that I purchased seems to be a quality product (I have not yet installed it} What I am happy about is the way a problem thar arose was resolved. I had not received my intial order and I let those know that take care of those problems. The problem was resolved much better than I had anticipated and was done in a quick manner.
2,Doesn't state that it is designed for doors inside the house,"I bought this to replace the one we had, as the flap had cracked. I wanted the same model and size, so it would fit the hole in the door w/o modifications. Picture looked the same, measurements were too, so I ordered it. What the description lacked is that it is not made for doors that lead to the outside. This one has no weather stripping (hair-like brushes) like the old one. So as I write this, we are experiencing a extreme cold snap here in Washington. Cold air is streaming in!"
4,Very nice for the price !,"The installation was pretty quick, probably about 15 with my brother's help !My cat got it pretty quick, she is very smart and curious so that's a plus.Everything is really good quality specially for the price but the only reason why i gave them 4 starts is because there is not plastic to cover the interior of the door as i shown is the pictures, "" White door with gray Cat"" so it will not work for a hollow door unless you find a plastic, wood or something to make it work.Also the back panel just comes with an adhesive sticker to sticky in the door which i believe two three years from now might need some silicone or something as it might fall off.Overall this product is great for the price and to keep the stinkiness away which is the best part!!"
3,Basic and seems satisfactory,"Pros: Installation was a breeze anyone with a drill and a jigsaw can get this installed quicker than the time taken to take the door off the hinges.Cons: There is no liner which I didn't think about until I cut the door and its foam filled so the cat claws out little bits all over the place.My cat has been using this for less than one week and has already figured out how to open the lock. I'm going to have to change to a door with the lock on one side only, Hopefully a rotating lock like a previous door we had which worked great."
4,Good Value,"I needed a way for my cat to access her litter box in a closet under the stairs and this cat flap was the cheapest option. It serves its intended purpose and my cat learned to use it quickly. As many other reviews have stated, the lock is garbage (it broke in half within 1 minute of me opening the box), but I don't anticipate ever wanting the ability to lock the door in its current location."
2,Flimsy cheap cat door,"This cat flap has no weather stripping around the door and the locking mechanism is a sliding piece of plastic that catches on a tiny protrusion on the flap. It is so poorly constructed that the one I ordered arrived with the little piece of plastic broken off (I found it in the box it was shipped in). Thanks to Amazon, they issued me a full refund and I immediately purchased Cat Mate Lockable Flap Cat Door which is a couple dollars more but well worth it. It is weather-stripped and has a sturdy locking mechanism. It is the same type slider lock as the cheaply made one, but it is well designed. Both doors are identical in size and nearly the same in appearance but you will be much better off with the other one."
3,Usable but lacking,"Its cheap. So cheap they don't even provide a template for cutting the hole in the door. As another reviewer pointed out there is a proble in that there is no 'lip' between the panels that go on either side of a door. So, if you install into a hollow door there is a gap between the two panels. Even if you install into a solid door, you have bare wood visible between the front and back panels.Update: forgot to mention that only one side has screws to attach to the door. The other side is stuck onto the door. It no longer sticks and has fallen off."
3,Good for the price,The cat flap is good for indoor use into a room that people don't really go into. It looks fine on the front side once installed. If you have hollow doors however the backside leaves the interior of the door exposed from the rear. Recommended for installation into a laundry room or the like.
4,Pet door,Came fast.. Good product for price.We use it as access for cats to go up and downstairs to the basement for litter and food.It has been great!! We have two year old triplets and they are always kicking it and pulling on the door and sticking there heads in it so it is very durable.. I would highly recomend this. Install was fairly simple on our hollow door too..
1,My cat gets his paw STUCK due to the magnetic door!,"The door does what it's supposed to, but my cat repeatedly gets his paw stuck because the magnetic pull is too strong! Mind you, my cat's not tiny- he's a good 16 lbs! He's gone crazy and rolled all over because his paw gets stuck. There is nothing more horrifying than hearing your baby cry out in pain. It's annoying. If I could return it, I would."
1,Cat Got Her Paw Stuck Very Easily,"We had only had the cat door installed for about a day when our cat managed to get her paw stuck in the flap - she was screaming in pain, and we had to squeeze her toes even further to get them out of the flap. We won't use a cat door with a rigid flap again."
2,"Works, but definitely not quietly!","Obviously it functions, it's a piece of plastic on a hinge, who could get that wrong? However the company's claim that this is a quiet cat door is specifically false advertisement! We are taking it off our bedroom door so we can get a decent night sleep with our three cats. I won't say don't buy this, just be aware of what your are buying."
3,"NOISY out of the box, QUIET with some modifications!","The door kept me up all night with cats going in, out, and pawing at the door. This door is squeaky and usually bangs around on the plastic frame unless your installation is perfect. I used a file to remove the interference between the flap and the frame and I put a drop of grease in the hinges and now the door is perfectly silent!"
3,cat door,"Good if you are using indoors, also if door is more than 1/2"" thick you will need to buy the expander."
5,Great,"Taste is awesome, mix with skim milk, 1 serving around 3-4pm and another before bed. Have gained about 7 lbs in 2 weeks. Must continue to eat like a horse, do not use as meal replacement. Makes you poop a lot! Buy a plunger as well!!!"
2,"Great product, horrible after-effect","Ok, so I decided to start mass gaining when I bought this product because I had read awesome reviews about it concerning taste, efficiency, and price value; however, I did not read anything about the laxative effect that came with it. After two days, I was getting severe liquid diarrhea and it was not pleasant at all, it was not worth the price.2/5 stars because I did enjoy drinking it, mixed very well, but that taste wasn't superb as I had anticipated. Did I mention I had severe diarrhea because of all the maltodextrin that comes jam-packed into it?"
4,Great value!,"I would highly recommend this product. Real Gains provides more carbs and protein than the average weight gainer relative to the serving size and is a lot cheaper.I bought the Strawberry Ice Cream which tastes really good, but after only a few times you get sick of strawberry, which is why I rated it a 4.The product mixes really well with water, all 3 1/2 scoops, but not so well with milk, unless you use a blender."
4,Vanilla flavor,good flavoring with vanilla. poeple generally say to stay away from that flavor but i dont mind it. if your going to be spending money on this i would go with the 10 lb bag. has a great deal.
5,So far so good.,"I have not had this product a full month yet so I can't say much about the gains. I can say for the time I have been drinking this (twice a day) I have seen the muscle gains from my work outs stay longer because I often miss meals. I will also tell you that the flavor is great, the powder mixes perfect with milk in a shaker cup with whisk ball and the nutrition is great. I often work overnight hours and sleep during the day. This product was perfect for keeping my calorie intake high. I will be ordering this brand from now on.Vanilla ice cream"
1,Don't Buy This Watch,"This watch is made by Geneva Watch Group. Their quality is terrible. Mine wasn't working properly, so I contacted them to have it fixed and they said I had to pay for shipping to send it back. The repair is covered under warranty but shipping is not. What a ripoff. I'm returning mine."
5,"Nice price, nice watch",Beautiful watch with a very large face and a nice genuine leather strap. It also includes the box and the price tag like if you went into Kenneth Cole or something and bought it.-Chris
3,Cute but very limited,"Mainly recipes and focuesed on only three themes: Beach BBQ, Deserts, and Tropical/Asian theme (sake, coconut, etc)...would have liked ideas on the more traditional shower."
4,Creative and Modern Ideas,"Creative and modern ideas for throwing a modern day bridal shower. Exquisite still photography showcasing each shower favor, table setting, food item, and room decor. Very different from the existing bland works that currently sit on the bookstore shelves. Some of the ideas are too posh or ""stuffy"" for middle America, but the ideas can certainly be adapted to your budget and tastes."
5,A genius' literature.,"IF there is a hell, it is a christain-manufactured illusion. I do not worship anyone or anything and believe preaching religion must stop. A revolution is under way. Call it the LEBER and expect this at the beginning of the new millennium.P.S. This is more serious than any thorn-torn Christ could ever imagine."
1,Waste of Paper.,This book is a disgrace to the legacy of LaVey. From reading it you can easily tell it was hastily put together. It holds no new information except what LaVey's divulges about his personality. The Satanic Bible and to a lesser extent The Devil's Notebook are the only books of value by LaVey. Its major flaw is it discusses obscure topics that would interest no one (except maybe LaVey).
1,Ehhhh,"This book does contain a few good perspectives and essays, but I wouldn't waste my time. When I say a few, I mean a few. The further and further I got into the book, the less impressed I was with LaVey, and the more I considered him a JOKE. Just tonight, I read a whole list of LaVey's lies - on the churchofsatan.org website nonetheless! But anyways, this book sucks. Check out some Nietzsche or Crowley instead."
1,Seek Jesus,"Please stop entertainng yourselves with this garbage,seek Christ before it is too late.The name of Jesus Christ is the only way to save yourselves from a firey eternity... Please bretheren stop this madness."
5,A Wonderful Farewell From An Intuitive Spirit,"Thank you, Mr. LaVey, et al., for your sorely needed contributions to this place of wrath and tears."
2,Very disappointing considering his past works,"Having read everything about/written by the good Doctor, I was expecting something of similar stature, especially with this being his last work. It was a pity to delve into this work of short essays and find myself saying over and over, ""What the hell is he talking about?"" He has departed much from his usual crystal clear, in-your-face logical approach and adopted a confusing contradictory style of presenting topics. This book is similar in size and layout of The Devil's Notebook, but all comparisons end there. It's a shame the Doctor left us with such a poor last example of his otherwise brilliant philosophy and writing skills."
5,learning how anton see things,Anton has a great point of view. i think even if your not a satanist you should give his books a read.
5,Perfect!,"More witticism & cutting humor from Dr. LaVey. Truly entertaining, and at times even inspiring, there's a lot of food for thought here."
4,"not quite The Devil's Notebook, but pretty Damned good","this isn't nearly the brain-feast that _The Devil's Notebook_ is, but of course is enjoyable for other reasons. _Satan Speaks_, while not containing as applicable information as _Notebook_ does, gives a much better insight on the man who was Anton Lavey. it's packed with much more humor, and much more hatred, than was _Notebook_. there are several good rants here, and enough ideas and quotes to use to piss off most anybody you'd ever want to offend--it's great! this book is the closest most will ever have come to sitting down and chatting with good ol' Anton."
3,Satan Speaks,"While I enjoyed certain essays because of their humorous content, other essays just didn't interest me. LaVey often expressed opinions with which I disagreed, often because the opinions were expressed in a bitter, jaded tone. I much prefer the vibrant power and intensity of the Satanic Bible, as it inspires me more."
4,Satan smiles...,"This the final book by Anton LaVey is a lot like ""The Devil's Notebook"". It has its ups and downs, but many more downs than ""The Devil's Notebook"", which was superbly crafted. Still, these two books offer great insight into one of the most interesting minds of the 20th century. Hopefully this books acts as a guide into the satanic philosophy (Rand, Nietzsche, Machiavelli, Darwin, Twain etc). LaVey might be dead, but his legacy lives on.Shemhamforash!Hail LaVey!Hail life!"
4,LA VEY's ULTIMATE CATHARSIS...,"If you have read his other works, this final offering would seem to be rather fitting. I found myself both laughing more than usual and also pausing significantly between chapters in response to the particular ways in which he drives home his discussions, whether they be about the banalities of associating with most members of the human species or hanging tendrils of fake mucus from one's own nasal passages. (Read to find explanation). One way or another, this is a book which is sure to cause a significant change or response within those who read it, the nature of the change or response being left inevitably to the reader's own disposition"
3,"It is a shame, really...","Old Anton's wits started to leave him toward the end, and this book is the result. This collection of disconnected ravings is often quite amusing, but not in the way the author intended (I would asssume). It was slightly upsetting to see the tangible descent of a once perspicacious mind into the depths of senility. As a Satanist, I should have been bereaved, but since I'm also a Nihilist, I just don't care."
2,LaVey's Final Words (Yawn!),"Misanthropic, jaded, and ranting final book from Anton LaVey, bitter at having his 'legend' exposed by many journalists.Essays like ""Why I Can't Make Money"" (LaVey spent his last years living on California state aid) show how bleak and pitiful he had become. Little indepth social theories, applications or practices compared to his earlier work (which ripped off Ragner Redbeard, Wilhelm Reich, P.T. Barnum, Ayn Rand, and Aleister Crowley, often without attribution). Hardly cutting edge or even relevant, but LaVey will always have a market in angst ridden teenagers. The introduction by Marilyn Manson is the best part of an otherwise uninteresting book.For the REAL future of the Left Hand Path (Satanism), see Stephen Edred Flowers' 'Lords Of The Left Hand Path' or anything by Don Webb."
2,Sad.,"The pathetic rantings of a bitter old man. There is no hope, no life to Indulge in save for the past glories of 1940's ""total environments"" and girl's wet panties. Lesson: don't befriend Satan then turn your back on him or you'll end up like this!"
5,"""Satan Speaks"" will be considered a classic.","In the tradition of Mark Twain, ""Satan Speaks"" is a monumental work of social commentary. Anton Szandor LaVey cuts right to the bone with this one. It is much more than mere rantings; It is a Rampage. He goes on an all out assault. No one is spared in this new tirade on the Human Condition. He attacks everyone from social workers to occultists. People whom he makes clear need to get a life (or maybe just need to get laid). He simply gets to the point and explains his dislike for these, and other, ""Tasmanian Fleas."" He tells you what he really thinks of people and society. This book is destined to be a Classic, with its cutting wit (I could not help but laugh at the truth of it all) and Black Humour. Dr. LaVey is truly one of humanities foremost commentators. Don't expect politically correct politeness in this work; only truth."
1,Satan Speaks- but he should have kept quiet!,"Just as LaVey's ""Satanic Bible"" was a mixture of 'smart' and 'pointlessly stupid' ideas, so goes ""Satan Speaks,"" except ""Satan Speaks"" contained more of the 'pointless' junk. (I follow LaVey in his philosophy until he starts talking about magic spells, refusing to bath, and ""orgasmic sneezing""... so if your into that kind of crap, ""Satan Speaks"" is the book for you!)"
1,Not up to standards.,"I Loved the Satanic bible, I found it to be a wonderful insight into the flaws of religion and society, and to describe to a T the correct way to live one's life. My philosophy on life was almost identical even before I read the book. ""Satan Speaks"" Was also intelligent in it's wording, but it really didn't seem to say much, having little to no important or insightful content. Many of the chapters were not only pointless, but completely rediculous and added nothing to the book. Satan Speaks seems like a collection of essays that was probably better left unpublished. I have lost a certain amount of respect for Anton Szandor LaVey."
3,This is a good book.,"This is a large collection of essays on the philosophies of Anton LaVey.I gave it 3 stars because you have to already like LaVey before you read this to get into it easily. If you are new to the dark philosophy I suggest you read The Devil's Notebook (also by LaVey) first.The essays this book contains are full of humor and logical truth. An excellent read for any satanis or any ""would be satanist"" or someone just interested in reading on someones philosophical beliefs."
4,captivating and edifying,"""The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition"" (and the ""Christian Tradition"" series as a whole) is among the most useful books I have ever come across.Mr. Pelikan has focused like a laser on what was TAUGHT (as in ""the stuff we have actual historical documentation for"") by the church throughout history. This is most refreshing. No pet theories or speculation taint this book (I guess this means Mr. Pelikan won't be asked to work with A&E or Bill Moyers any time soon.)This book can be dry in spots. This probably speaks more to my distaste for ""scholarly works"" than any deficiency in Mr. Pelikan's writing style. However, most readers will probably find this book both captivating and edifying. I recommend it."
5,Brilliant,"Jaroslav Pelikan has a superb skill for presenting the history of doctrine in a readable, comprehensive format. It is especially valuable that he treats issues as a whole, showing varied points of view, rather than using a strictly chronological format.The patristic era is fascinating, and the more so with Pelikan's setting the developments forth in a fashion which makes all the ""pieces of the puzzles"" come together. I found it extremely enlightening, and would highly recommend this and the other books in the series."
4,Developing History,"The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition is the first of three volumes. Vol. one covers 100 - 600. It deals with A History of the development of Doctrine. It deals with the changing and development of the doctrine of the early church. Written on a scholar level with documentation in the side margins make it an insteresting book. Looking for facts, this is your book."
3,Impressive sound but fatal flaw,"The sound from the speakers is impressive for their size, it was able to fill my decent size living room without problem. Same goes for the sub, it's not a monster, but it will probably satisfy 90% of the people out there.However, there is one issue that will probably make me return this: even though there is a digital input, you cannot listen to Dolby Digital surround sound through it; the best it can do is Dolby Prologic II. Since all HD programming is being broadcast in Dolby Digital, I don't know what Yamaha was thinking."
3,Yamaha,"The first time I had baught the system, I had problems, the disc tray would open and while closing, it would jam and close half way. I Then traded it in for another one.And now, the sound is excellent, and very clear. And the system is easy to Use.Also the price was affordable.However, I had some movies with a multi-angle logo show up on screen. In the manual it does not tell you how to remove the feature. Still waiting for a response from Yamaha."
2,I expected better,"There just isn't much to praise in this book. Standard aliens, standard plot, and one glaring scientific error at the end when Pohl's plot relies on methane having a greater density than average Earth atmosphere and sinking and pooling at the surface of the Earth-- in fact, methane has only about half the density of ""air"" and rises up through it. How does someone of Pohl's experience and stature make a freshmen chemistry mistake like this? Answer: it was a rushed book, and it shows."
2,Pohl marking time,"I quite enjoyed the previous books in this series. But this last entry has the flaws more typically associated with a middle book. Relatively little happens and few if any new ideas are introduced. Because the premise of the series was the struggle to control the ""eschaton"" at the end of time, perhaps Pohl was discouraged by the mounting astronomical evidence that the universe will not collapse."
3,"an 0.k book, i guess","frederik pohl's book is a sequel to ""siege of eternity"" which i didn't read. (someone should write something about this sequal plague phenomena in todays sci-fi literature ..) since i haven't read the previous book, i left with some holes about the story plot. the story itself is very plain, there is planty of activity the there is a good flow of events. the story doesn't seem to be very reliable - the characters are very superficcial, and the eliens characters are quit redicoulous. the story is very plain and unclever (the way the aliens are being beatten) i don't think i'll read the next sequel (there will surely be one) - i give this story 3 stars."
2,Not Good For TechnoGeeks Or Gamers!,"This LCD screen is great eye candy, sure, and it doesn't take up as much room as your basic desktop monitor, and it's a good buy for a person who does nothing on their computer but, say, word processing and web-surfing. BUT, if you are a computer gamer of ANY kind, this is a very, very bad buy for you. It's not just this LCD monitor in particular, it's all LCD monitors- they become a blurry mess in almost any kind of computer game, primarily FPS (First Person Shooters), flight sims, RPGS (Role Playing Games) and just about any game where the action is remotely fast-paced- even in some strategy games, such asAge of Empires II. Besides the fact that this [thing] costs mucho grando dinero, the blurry-factor is enough to dissuade the wise buyer. Ciao!"
3,"A copy, not the original DVD_mine came defective","First of all, this is a copy. It comes in a plastic CD case. This is not the original DVD, and for this reason I think it's overpriced.On top of that, I was sent a defective DVD. After 10 minutes of watching I got ""Skipping over damaged area"". Then the program stopped responding. I will return it. 3 stars for the exercises I was able to watch."
5,Face Aerobics One and Beauty Cream offer,The well presented dvd and sample cream was way better than I expected. I love the dvd and the cream is great too. I would actually order a second video - thought I got a good deal on what I received and would recommend and buy as a gift for someone. Bravo!
2,Sticks and skips.,"I agree with another review, this DVD is a copy and it sticks, very aggravating. The workout itself is a good one but it is hard to do when the DVD sticks so much. If I still had the packaging I'd send it back. 2 stars because of the poor quality DVD. I'd give the workout a 5 though."
5,Face Aerobics,"This is very easy to follow. The exercises work. I just purchased the Advanced Face Aerobics. I've only used it a couple of times, but it seems great too. I like that the camera stays focused on her face, and there are no distractions or ""cute"" unnecessary moves. You can do the exercises quickly and get on with your life. Isn't that the point of exercise at home?"
3,Decent Deal,"Bought this hard to find CD. Disc arrived fine, but case was cracked. This is probably because they shipped it in a sealed soft plastic envelope - no padding! The shipping also took a long time. I am glad to have found this particular CD, but I wouldn't buy from this seller otherwise"
4,Stunning new talent,"This is a captivating and unique story, with a heroine who has a unique profession - that of deathmaiden, someone who eases the passage into the next world. You will believe that Frances Oliver and the Society of Deathmaidens actually exists (who knows? Maybe it does). Also unique is the author's strong voice and lyrical prose. I can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed reading descriptive passages, but Ruth Francisco can really make you feel like you can see, hear and smell the story as it unfolds. I can't speak too highly of this book! Not only is this an absorbing story, but finally it is a mystery that is actually about something, a novel of ideas and not just another whodunit or police procedural. I highly recommend this book."
2,Really creaks to the end,"It starts out as an interesting premise, but you can see this is a first time novel by the heavy-handed way in which the author feeds us the information about the duties of a deathmaiden and their supposed organization and philosophy. Add to that all the background on the Maya cannabilistic practices, and we lose sight of the characters, who are not really intriguing enough to sustain this book. A worthy first effort which could have used a great deal more editing."
4,I like Death and this Maiden,"Tomas, a little boy, dies under the care of Frances Oliver, a deathmaiden. She is a member of the fictional Society of Deathmaidens, a hospice-like Dr. Kevorkian-esque group that acts as midwives to the dying, helping them transition with dignity. But Frances starts asking questions into Tomas' death. From the start, this unusual computer-and-TV-spurning heroine with friends such as the eccentric artist and deathmaiden would-have-been Pepper, gets tangled into an intriguing plotthat takes a long time to reach its conclusion and uncover the evidence, but offers twists and turns; there has to be some suspense in this mystery, after all, but it's Frances' soul reflections and inner struggle that drive the book, as well as an exploration of the meaning of medicine and the value of death."
4,"Great new character, ""movie-like"" plot.","I hope Ruth Francisco carries on her title character in more books. Francisco draws a compelling character in Frances Oliver, who has trained in the art of helping the dying into death within a hospice setting.However, the book's plot gets away from this intriguing premise by setting the character in a rather workman-like plot, employing the age-old villains of big-business and shady medical experiments. I can just see Ashley Judd or Angelina Jolietrooping through the Mexican mountains in designer duds after the ""bad-guys"" in the movie version of the book.I'd love to see Francisco put her character in smaller, more intimate stories. Laura Lipmann and Carol O'Connell do this with their Tess Monaghan and Kathy Mallory characters.Ms Francisco, please keep writing about Frances Oliver."
5,Cute and Fun Book for Kids!!!!,"The how and why of everyday objects from typewriters to pens to vaccuum cleaners. Except: Thomas Crapper, a plumber, developed a type of flushing toilet in 1872 that carried his name. He perfected the cistern--the tank that holds the water for flushing. And he made flushing quieter. Women at the turn of the century, sensitive to bodily noises, wanted a ""really silent toilet"". A book writen about Crapper was called Flushed with Pride. The author wrote ""There is no question that Crapper's heart was in the toilet""."
1,Merchant never sent the jenas,"Merchant never sent the jeans, never notified me that they were unavailable until I contacted them. Poor customer service."
4,"A litle bit confuse, but a nice start.","As a medicine student, I used this book to introduce myself to biochemestry before the classes and as a reference guide. Even knowing only very simple concepts of chemestry, it won't be hard to understand this book. It is, indeed, a litle bit confuse (not the text, only the organization) and the chapter sequence is weired (for example, the chapter about the structure of DNA and the other about the control of gene expression are far, far away). Because of this organization, you just can't read this book in sequence or you'll get lost. There are chapters about molecular biology too, and they are a great start so you can go deeper on this matter using Bruce Albert's Molecular Biology of the Cell."
4,"CONCISE; YET, WELL-DETAILED","Compiled by an experienced mind, this ""Biochemistry"" by Lubert Stryer may seem a little pricey, but it is worth investing on. Its everyday language is comprehensive, generously illustrated, and presents details using a concise format. The book was designed for intermediate learners; although that its aura appeals to both beginners and advanced students. The sequential organisation of each section makes self-teaching an easy task. There are also revised chapters with overviews of Developmental Physiology and Genetics. It is a very fine text."
1,Terribly messy and ugly.,"This book belongs to the past, when people did not know how to write nice biochem. books. Today, we have Matthews et al, Voet, Lehninger... All those books are easy to read and follow, have fantastic illustrations and pedagogcial aids - and do not contradict theselves in every other line. This book may have been the first, once - but it sure was not the last, too, so go and get a more modern account of biochem, in a new and brushed-off format, that you can read also if you do not have a heap of time on your hands!"
4,Very helpful!,"I really like this book. It does a great job of explaining the topics in detail, yet not too esoteric that one without a background in either biology or chemistry won't be able to understand. I have neither and I feel I am progressing along well.The progression of the information content in the chapters makes sense.I recommend this book."
5,We Love Kipper,"My son loves this book. We love all the Kipper Lift the Flap books. They're all so sweet. The story is simple, yet interesting, the artwork is cute and soft. I can highly, highly recommend everything Mick Inkpen has ever done.My son loves this book in conjunction with the Sunny Day Lift the Flap book."
3,This book was very freaky.,"I rate ""Murder in Paradise"" a 6 because it had quite a freaky plot. I can't believe the ending! It freaked me out so bad. Still, though, I recommend this book to other Sweet Valley High readers. I was scared when Mrs. Alice Wakefield disappeared, and how weird Chris and Alex were acting."
4,Sony does not disappoint,"Like the other reviewer, I initially had a difficult time getting the resolution that I had gotten in a previously owned LCD monitor. I quickly learned that I had the refresh rate set too low for the screen size that I had selected. Once I boosted the refresh to 75, everything fell into place. The image is bright, crisp, and very clear. I use this monitor as one of two that I use for photo editing. The picture quality is often better than my Sony Trinitron monitor. I'm glad I made this purchase."
4,2001: A Desk Space Odyssey,"Very slim and stylish. Just how a 21st century monitor should look. I bought this LCD for my home and chose this model in particular because I wanted a lighter, thinner, more elegant monitor... a monitor that you'd actually want to look at... a conversation piece. This model in particular is just that. It's like picking up a picture frame, rather than a 17"" TV. OK, maybe it doesn't have many bells and whistles, didn't get #1 best anything, or isn't even the best value. But who cares? I paid the extra to get this one over the cheaper ones because it just looks so cool and it's less than 2 inches thick, so pleasing to the eye. All the other cheaper LCDs are too bulky in appearance and still look like a CRT from the front."
5,Passion with Balance,"When it comes down to the wire, managing change is really all about balance, something the Japanese treasure and express in the art of Zen, and passion. Passion without direction and focus is just a bunch of energy, like an Italian lover. Passion, with focus and balance, can be like a laser beam--very powerful and significant.The first part of one's life is usually spent chasing success, and the second half chasing significance. Nana's Change We Must is working to see that we all get an early start on the second."
1,An old cd under a new name is not worth more money.....,"This cd is an exact reissue of the Johnny Cash and June Carter 16 Biggest Hits cd. One only has to compare the track listing on the Import version of this cd listed on Amazon to the 16 Biggest hits cd to see what a huge ripoff this new package is. The sound quality is likely not any better than previous issues of all of these songs, in fact it theoretically could be louder and more distorted given the way music on cd is mastered these days, but it could be that they used the old 16 Biggest Hits master and didn't even re-master the recordings. Save your money, buy the cheaper 16 Biggest Hits cd, and avoid pieces of junk like this that are put out because record companies cannot think of new ways to market recordings without rehasing the exact same thing over and over again. This cd gets one star because there is nothing special about it."
4,Complete your Johnny Cash collection,If you love Johnny Cash you will appreciate this album as he sings with other singers to bring us fresh music.
5,very strong book and hard to every fully digest,this is a book that outta be required reading for all age groups because i don't think that children let alone adults can fully understand the complex and still unfair things that happen in America and how it all still impacts America and Society at large. reading about Slavery is so painful and always will be until its fully acknowledged as the Greatest Tragedy in American Life Period. a much needed reminder and read.
3,Alright for avid Marvel readers but not for the average Joe.,"Marvels is a well illustrated piece of art, but if you haven't read many of the super hero stories (the Marvels) then I don't really recommend this book. Its taken entirely from the perspective of a news photographer, so he only sees glimpses of the marvels (just as you would if you lived in that era). This can be a refreshing take, but it also can be really frustrating, since you don't get the whole story. For instance, the photographer initially hears of a duel between two of the Marvels then a few pages latter the photographer notes that the two duelists are fighting side by side, with a very limited explanation of how they overcame their differences. The book really tries to take all of the Marvel comics and sum them up as seen through a photographer's eyes. But for those of us who haven't read the 1,000's of comics this really doesn't make a fulfilling read. You just keep wondering what happened."
3,Overated and Poorly Written,"Yes, Alex Ross' artwork, as always is stunning. Busiek's writing on the other hand, is so bad I avoided anything he wrote like the plague until Thunderbolts. The plot barly exists and this is really an excuse for Ross to paint some great scenes from Marvel's past."
3,This book is OK.,"This book is all right. it had several parts that were amazingly boring. For instance, the publishers had to add every little detail they wanted to try and make this book fantastic. I have heard that comics were originally written for kids, but this books IS not! Who wants to read a book that is boring and has all kinds of wild explosins going on by the Marvels? To me, the Marvel Universe is NOT important! It is not a good book at all! Not bad, though."
1,Plotless with little characterization,"This book was not worth reading. While it starts out with the 'birth' of the human torch, soon many random superheros and super villains are incorporated within the book. There's lots of action, but the reader doesn't really care who wins or who loses, since other than the torch and the protagonist (a photographer) there is absolutely no characterization! Obviously the author is trying to pack in as many superheros/supervillains into one book as he can. There's almost nothing to keep you turning the pages in this book and i am surprised i even finished it. I recommend sticking with a book that focuses on just one hero (or one group of heros, such as with the X-Men). Don't waste your time reading this book with no plot or characterization.Idea to fellow female readers: Check out ""Merridian"" instead. It is way cool.To female and male readers: pick up an ordinary comic book or a good graphic novel like Galaxy Express 999."
3,"Good, Not Great.","An interesting take on the early days of the Marvel Universe. Alex Ross' art is always wonderful, but here it doesn't translate as well to the Fire as, say, Kingdom Come does. I thought Busiek's story dragged at times. Everything considered, Marvels was good, not great."
2,Would be great if it worked on anything other than the Kindle Fire,Not sure what the hell is wrong w some of these digital comics. This only worked on a Kindle Fire not even on my ipad. Buy with caution. Severely disappointed.
5,Terrific way to read a beloved series,"This is a review of the Kindle ebook. I bought the Marvels comics by Busiek/Ross when they were new. I own the trade paperback and a collectors edition. As you might imagine, someone who does something like that ""collects"" the books. That means I can't go back and reread them without taking them out of their protective covers. At any rate, I loved the (for me at any rate) unusual way in which the stories were told. The stories are magnificant and the art is wonderful. Having Marvels on Kindle lets me take the art and stories with me with no fear of damaging the book."
5,marvel book,Got it for a gift for my son. He loved it. Received it quickly and in very good shape. Thanks
5,Great Story,"This is the first time that when I finished reading a comic book I thought, ""This would make a wonderful movie."" This is a story told not from a superhero point of view but from that of a photographer. It highlights some of the major events in Marvel comics history from the original Human Torch to the coming of the X-Men to, my personal favorite, the death of Gwen Stacy. Kurt Busiek has crafted a story that flows so smoothly once you start to read you won't want to quit until it's over and then you'll want to re-read. This is only highlighted by the dazzling art of Alex Ross who realistic style meshes together so well with the story. If you're a fan of Marvel comics or a good story, this is the book for you."
5,Excellent Stuff!,"Ross does a great job on the art, unforunetly Kingdom Come's is twice as good. Busiek's script is wonderfully crafted, yet second to some of his Astro City work. The end result is a great tale, probably the best Marvel work of all time, but if you don't already have Kingdom Come and Astro City: Life in the Big City, you have no buisness buying this. Get those first, and then consider Marvels."
3,"Great artwork, subpar storytelling","When hiring someone like Ross to illustrate a series, you would think that you would pair him with a writer of equal caliber. This is not the case. The author tends to rush things along, instead of focusing in and actually telling a story to make you feel for some characters, you instead get a fast forward history of the marvel universe. Worth reading but don't go out of your way to buy."
3,good artwork,"good artwork with an OK story. I think my expectations were a bit too high going in, and given that it was mostly a recap of comic history that I had already read the originals. I'm not sure how entertaining it would be for someone unfamiliar with the old stories."
3,not for the uninitiated,"While the artwork is good, the story is too weak and shallow for those uninitiated in the Marvel universe (like me). There are tons of references to characters and events that for the most part just left me confused. While I have a decent familiarity with some of the Marvel characters, unless you've been reading dozens of Marvel comics for decades (since the story starts with Marvel #1) I'm not sure how much sense a lot of the story makes. People come in and out, battles are over, the city is destroyed, reparations are made.The basic premise, of how normal people adjust to living in a world of ""Marvels"", is a great idea. This graphic novel just doesn't pull it off extraordiarily well. Rather than feeling ""ambitious"" by showing some of the great events from 30+ years of Marvel comics, it just feels like someone is telling in-jokes and you're not an insider.Of course, if you are a huge fan of comics and have read them voraciously you might find more to like here."
4,"Sanders is not exactly Fuggs""ed""","This is a very good offering from one of the strangest artists of the 60's/70's. If you have forgotten about that time period, this release will give you that, 60's of the mind, feeling.Now if I could only find Mr. Sanders other solo recordings. I especially would like to find a song called ""The Illiad"" on CD. I think it is on the LP ""Sanders Truck Stop"" but I'm not sure."
2,Love Ed Sanders but not so good!,This is not the Ed Sanders as we know him on Beer Cans on the Moon or from any Fugs record. Kinda' not worth it...sorry Ed!
5,Great!,"With the Super-Soldier Serum wearing off, Captain America's body decays, and begins to die. Left alone in his death throes, Cap is spirited away, and revived by his old enemy, the Red Skull. Working with Cap's old flame, Sharon Carter, the Skull needs Cap's help to defeat a common enemy. Can Captain America trust the Red Skull? No. But, to save the free world, he might have to work with him.It is great to see Captain America again, and this comic novel carries him forward as the great hero we remember. The story is very good, and the illustrations are nothing short of excellent. I bought this book for my son, who liked it a lot, but I just had to steal it away and read it for myself. It's a great book, and my son and I both highly recommend it to you!"
4,Good ergonomics,"I am 5'10"", 200 lbs and my wife is 5'3"" 120. We both fit well on this and the machine is very smooth. Buy it."
4,Another take on the Boldts,"Boldt Castle, on Heart Island, might be one of the most romantic places in America. The public has been spoon fed the 'romantic' legend of the Boldts for far too many years. Professor Malo did his research. He spent time among the people who remember the Boldts. This book may not disprove the romantic legend, but it certainly puts a new slant on the story. Like Professor Malo, I much preferred the Island and the legend before the Bridge Authority got hold of the property and began to restore it - with, as Professor Malo points out, historical inaccuracy.If you've every been to Boldt Castle, read this book. It will open your eyes, and remind you not to believe *everything* you hear."
1,Boldt Castle: In Search of the Lost Story,"Having visted Boldt castle numrous times over the past 30 years, I was all ways disappointed that there was never any new information about the Boldt's and there lives. The story that was presented never changed from the ""canned"" love story. After reading Boldt Castle: In Search of the Lost Story I was still disappointed as ther really wasn't that much new material. The book raised questions about the standard ""canned "" story but never really disproved it. In the end the story of Boldt castle and George and Louise is a tragic love story."
3,In Search of the Lost Story,"This is the story of another deluded megalomaniac from the era of rampant American industrialization who went insane and bankrupt because he was building another great castle as a shrine to his fat ego.George Boldt was a ruthless exploiter and profiteer but the story is sold as ""a castle built for love"" and a ""love tragedy"". The story has all been cleaned up because the park wants to make money on naive tourists who flock to the island (its attendance was at approximately 1,950,000 visitors per year).After the death of his wife Louise, workers stopped. The prevailing story is that George halted construction because he was so grief stricken over the loss of his precious wife, in actuality George Boldt went bankrupt because his wife was in charge of the building and he picked up a new lover after and his wife's death."
4,"Works really well on some scratches, but not all","I have dark colored bamboo floors, and they scratch very easily. A flooring guy recommended this stuff to me, and demonstrated it on a few scratches - amazing! Mostly it works on superficial scratches - white slashes on the dark floor. This will not work at all on deep scratches, or any scratch more than something superficial - for that you need a filler pen. All in all, though, it's definitelyl worth the money, and a good thing to have around. Works on furniture too!"
1,"if you want an oily scratched surface, this is for you.","i had some scratches on my wood table and when i used this the only thing that happened was that the table got oily. i can't imagine what types of scratches this would actually work for, but for me it was completely useless. truly disappointed."
2,Doesn't do anything for deep scratches,"I don't know if this helps for very minor scratches, but it does nothing for deep scratches. Save your money."
1,Might as well have bought snake oil,This was a huge waste of money. I only bought it based on the reviews. This product is a complete joke. I have lots of scratches on my dark wood kitchen table. I tried this on various scratches--all very light surface scratches. All it does it grease them up a bit. No effect whatsoever. I feel like I just bought a jar of snake oil off a wooden horse-drawn wagon--complete fake-out.
4,Bamboo floor scratch remover,"I tried several things to mask the white streaks that were appearing in my bamboo floors. I had about given up when I read about Tibet Almond Stick. While it didn't make the scratch totally disappear, it masked the white color and its real difficult now to see the scratch. I'm a satisfied buyer. Only problem: shipping cost more than the product! :-("
3,HIdes your screwups!,"While moving my couch across the new hardwood floor I guess i shouldve been more careful as I left a big scratch, luckily the Almond Stick worked to hide what I did. YOu just rub this thing over the scratch and it covers it up, if the scratch is too deep though it will just color it in so it's not so obvious but it's better then nothing."
1,Doesn't work,I ordered this item to remove scratches on my coffee table. The scratches were of various sizes from big to small. Applied the product as recommended - it did NOT remove a single scratch. It is just a kind of oil which changes the texture and wood looks more shiny... I can't understand how it can remove a scratch. The seller doesn't take opened items back - otherwise I would have returned it.To me it seems to be a scam - don't fall for it. Go to the local hardware store to get something...
1,This was really a bad pick,"I bought this almond stick because it was advertised that the stick would absolutly remove furniture scratches and I had one real doozey of a scratch on the feet of a chest I have. The cord of a vaccummn cleaner was forced across the feet too many times and a wide scratch resulted. Then I had the Odd ding or scratch on various pieces so I ordered this to see if it would work. Well, NO, it does not work. Not on little bitty scratches and certainly not on large ones. This was in my earliest days of ordering from Amazon, so I kept the stuff and stuck it in a drawer. If I were to order this today, I would immediately get in touch with the retailer and work out a refund, or send it back, or whatever was appropriate. I was not so savvy at the time so I still have it ""just in case."" But from my point of view, it has not worked and I would recommend that you save your money for something else. This did not work for me."
2,not good,"all this thing does is spread a thin layer of oil over your wood therefore ""hiding"" certain scratches. It really does not hide much of anything. Will still see all scratches. By the way,... don't even think of using this on wood flooring unless you want to want to visit the E.R."
3,Disappointed,The product seems to just be some liquid that soaks into the blemish to hide it. Does't really fill the blemish and only does a fair job on some scratches. Scratch is still visible after application. Product doesn't really live up to it's description.
5,Almond Stick,I couldn't believe I was unable to find this in any hardware store as I had lost mine during a move. I find it invaluable for touching up furniture scratches.
3,Leather case doen't fit,"The charger and hands free set works fine, but the leather case doesn't fit properly. I have to fiddle with the case to make sure it isn't blocking the earpiece for listening nor the microphone--otherwise people can't hear me and I can't hear them."
3,Not worth $40,This bundle is definitely not worth $40. The case is cheap as is the earbud. The only thing that makes it worth $10 is the fact that you would pay that amount for the car charger alone.
4,"Good value, decent quality","I was on the lookout for a cheap car charger for my Motorola V170, this one was cheaper than all the rest of the chargers, plus it includes a case and earpiece. The charger works fine, the case doesn't fit the phone that well but is made of leather/vinyl and should provide some protection for my valuable $20 phone. ;) Haven't tried the earpiece yet."
3,Not a bad deal for the price,"The earbud microphone has very low sensitivity and must be held right up to your mouth in order to be heard. The power cord does not seem to fit my car jack perfectly so tends to slip when hitting bumps, etc. Otherwise, it works fine. The phone jacket fits but the opening at the bottom for the power cord plug does not line up so I had to cut it out. There's nothing here that's really great, but all are useful and for this price, well worth it."
3,So-So,"We needed a new case for our phone and also wanted the instant charge for the car so that's why we purchased it. We were really dissapointed in the case. Our phone wouldn't fit right in it and when we finally got it in, the case wouldn't go completely closed. We haven't tried the instant charge adapter yet, but hopefully it will work better than the case."
3,Leaves room for improvement,When you get this product order the larger flange. I have installed two units and the bottom flange breaks off or get stripped.
3,"A Good Start, But Look to the Master","It always amazes me to read other's reviews and refrences when it come's to the Post Rock genre. This record hints at the abyss and even begins to touch my soul with its soaring beauty, but its nothing compared to the mind blowing depths and heights the M. Gira was producing with the Swans as far back as the early 80's. His later work tops anything I've yet heard! He invented what we call ""Post Rock"" today, and the hords of young God Speed worshipers would be well served to educate themselves by listening to the seminal Swans works of ""Children of God"",""White Light from the Mouth of Infinity/Love of Life"", ""The Great Annihilator"" and ""Sountracks for the Blind"". All feature vocals, which can be a turn-off for the young Post Rock follower, but the instrumental sections far exceed anything present in the God Speed/ Mogwai/ Zion/Explosions etc. era.Look to the past for the future and enjoy the enlightment!"
2,Dishonesty is luxury,"What's the point of this album? I started with a rhetorical question, and the music here sounds just like that; rhetorical and sophomoric. Silver Mt. Zion seems to be afraid to embrace the dark mood they create, and gives us instead fake promisses of hope. Try Tony Conrad & Faust cause they understand the nothingness and have the moxy to expose us to it. GYBE is much better, too."
4,The story of the preaching of the Gospel in the jungles of Vietnam,"This book, originally written in 1964, tells an amazing story of the spread of Christianity among the tribal people (Montagnards) of South Vietnam before and during the Vietnam war. It follows the life of Sau, a young Christian of the Chil tribe as he brings the message of the Cross to his family, his tribe and then on to other tribes. These people face starvation, sickeness, and the barbarity of the Viet Cong communists who try to enslave them and indoctrinate them into their ideology. If you have a heart for unreached peoples and Christians outside of the Western world, you'll love this book.[...]"
2,not as great as they looked,The shipping and everything went fine. the product doesnt look as good as it does in the picture at all. when it arrived they looked cheap. I returned them.
4,The connection between the Body and Mind,`Japanese Yoga' is comparatively an easy book to read and to follow. The author has a good gasp of Japanese culture and its philosophies. His explanations are relatively easy to follow. I think the paradox of Japanese is that they don't say much as most of their communication is through their actions and Davey has managed to explain many of demonstrated action into simple words. Although the book has fewer illustrations of yoga techniques which was rather disappointing but the explanation behind `Japanese Yoga' concept was well handled by the author. I will certainty recommend this book to any student who is keen to understand the basic principles and the source behind various exercises discussed in the book and those who are keen to understand the primary connection between the body and mind.
3,Kenneth Cole KC1267,"I agree the box isn't that great, it was hard to open the lid and it looked a little cheaply pacakged, however the watch is a nice looking watch. The leather on the band scratches easlily but for the price its an above average deal, but not spectacular."
5,At last!,"It is an excellent series, and now that I bought it, it is perfect.The plot is of a never ending stories that intermingle and evolve, producing an amazing story line that grows in complexity and details wonderfully.The dvd set box is of good quality. (45 DVD!)And having the complete series (up to season 9 for now) is a unique opportunity to rewatch the series."
2,Stargate Seasons 1-9,"Recording quality is good, but it comes in a cheap/cheesy box and all dvds are in a notebook style book of clear sleeves, with cheap labels. I expected better quality for the price."
4,Stargate Boxed Sets (1-9),"Product was in good shape. Basically though, it was 9 seperate boxed sets shipped together, unlike the Buffy TVS which was the entire series in one box."
1,Only in Spanish?,"Since this product, Stargate Atlantis SG1 Seasons 1-9 is, according to Amazon Customer Service, available only in Spanish as outlined in the Product Details, I'm wondering if those of you who have written the reviews below are refering to this product or are commenting on an English version you bought somewhere else.I just started watching the Stargate Atlantis series and would like to get caught up but starting with season 1 but I'm not gooing to spend the money buying individual seasons in English."
1,dissapointed,"i read the description and thought that all the seasons has french audio but only season 1,8 and 9 had it"
5,It Works!,"I was very suspicious of this collar, having purchased several that didn't work. I was especially frustrated that it didn't have a setting for different levels, and no power on light. However, it works. I have one of those constantly yapping chihuahuas, and after 3 brief times when he wore it, I now only have to show him the collar occasionally. It certainly has made my life better."
4,It works!,"It is supposed to be a good size for small dogs, but it seemed a little bit big and bulky by the larynx of our chihuahua mix. Nevertheless, it does work. Our dog does not make any noise when she is wearing it. She is smart and knows that when she is wearing her collar, she'd better not bark. Once in a while, she forgets, and we will hear her yelp because she got zapped. But she does not look psychologically affected by it, nor does she associate the collar with her shocks that she would show a dislike for it. She wears it only outside where every little noise gets her barking. Indoors, we don't mind her barking as she is our burglar alarm and we can directly train her to stop, as opposed to outdoors where we would have to chase her around to get her to stop. So this collar is good for her."
3,Innotek no-bark collar,"The collar was purchased to stop Max's annoying barking at the dog park. The ""charge"" is sporatic at best. Although the sensors are moistened and the hair underneath them is pulled away as much as possible, there is no rhyme nor reason when it will or won't work. There have been times that once he realizes that the woofing can lead to louder noise with no consequence he immediately begins. It is as tight around his neck as I feel is possible without strangling. The collar will be kept since there doesn't appear to be another solution to this problem."
2,"Works alright, not extremely effective","This collar was used for a Miniature Pinscher. He managed to find the threshold for this device and still barks. He also completely ignores the device if someone particularly scary enters our domain. He remains quiet for regular visitors, however, and this was a relief. All in all, for anything larger than a Jack Russell it would probably be completely ineffective and for even as small a dog as ours it wasn't fully as efficient as we hoped for."
1,Unhappy,"Very disappointed. It has worked 2x in the last week, at most, and the dog is still running around barking his head off. We have tightened it and replaced the battery. This product just does not work at all."
2,No Bark Collar,"I was thrilled with how quickly my Maltese and MinPin learned to quit barking while wearing the collar BUT collar quit working after only 6 mns. Thought maybe it was the battery and replaced it...no go. Unfortuately, my dogs also quickly learned that it quit working so we're back to square one! Gave it two stars because when it did work, it was awesome just can't afford a new one every 6 mns!!"
4,Worked good.,I have a 1 year old springer that would like to bark at 5:30am when we let him out to see if other dogs were in the neighborhood. The first few days while he was figuring it out he would bark a few times. Within a week of putting the colar on he had quit barking completely. After about a month I figured he had broken his habit so I thought I would remove the colar. No such luck. He will be wearing it a few more weeks to see if he can kick the habit for good.We can now leave him in the outside kennel while we are away from home and not worry about him disturbing the neighbors.
2,Worked...for a while,"We had this collar for at least a year, but it just quit working. The red lights would blink...but no shock. I even put it on my own neck and shouted. Red light - yes...shock - no. Look - the collar cost 30 bucks. Lasted at lesat a year (wish i could remember when i first got it, could have been 2 years) but now it has stopped. Thinking i am going to try my luck at something a little more since my labrador LOVES to bark at the sky."
1,DID NOT WORK ;(,"I run a doggy daycare out of my home and love dogs. I have worked with many different breeds and sometimes there is a barking issue, as I have about 12 fruit trees filled with birds and squirrels. I was very excited about this product and it was my first ""shock"" collar experience. The ultra-sonic collar had no effect on my dogs fixation at talking to the birds, rodents, and sky. The other dogs would just sit and stare at him. The collar has been used daily for almost a month and it is not going off, correcting or working. I just sit and watch him bark with it on for a full hour with no obvious corrections and this is a typical day. I called the company after the first week of this and they told me to give it time - well I think a month is long enough."
4,anti-bark collar....works,"collar works very well, but my dog is smart enough to know when it is on, and when it isn't."
3,Good Product once you figure it out,The product worked once we got the fitting correct on the dog with a larger dog Lab you need to ensure the probes are close to the skin .Our dog has adjusted very well to quick jolts he recives when he barks too much . Our neighbours have reported the constant barking has stopped and he no longer barks just to bark.I would definetly recommend the product with training to coordinate the dogs progress.
3,"Works, but looks really cheap","This product works fine, just looks cheaper than some others. Worth the price? I think so."
1,INNOTEK COLLARS BEWARE,I just want to let you know that I bought a collar at the pet store to help my dog from barking so much.The dog I have no more......The collar was on him and it went off for no reason and would not stop the red light didn't even come on......I went to try to disconnect the collar the dog was screaming in agony and guess what took a chunk out of my hand I shook my hand he went to the floor and went for my leg and gave me a good bruise where he tried to bite me. He was baby and my guardian. It scared so bad he is gone now. Had him such a baby I couldln't walk and he was very protective of me he was really hurting that day. I just want to let you know the collar go off at any time. I called company no symphothy from them but thats ok I'm not done. I called the place I bought it from they already removed them from the shelf and want to know in a week or so if I've heard from the company I think to see what kind of people there like so heads up beware.Best of Luck
3,Stopped working,"I'm not entirely sure - I'll have to check the battery, but this collar was working at first and now he barks right through it. He will yelp in pain with his first bark and then continue to bark. We are using the long prongs, because we heard the short ones don't work."
1,Don't do it ...,I tried this on two different dogs and go the same reaction. Yipping and cowering in a corner. I do not have the heart to watch them suffer.Some say their dogs learned instantly .. mine learned to be fearful of the collar and it just seemed to change my one dog's fun and loving personality over night. After a few days of trying to use this - it went back. I will take their barking any day over hurting them.
1,ruff ruff,doesn't seem to do a thing! maybe i need to shave my dogs neck to get the effectInnotek BC-50B Automatic No-Bark Dog Collar
1,You might as well buy a TASER!!!!!!,"We've tried sonic collars,and other training aids with no joy. So we tried this product with high hopes. But after using it for about 4 hrs. we found it to not for our family. If you feel that your dog is family just think about putting a shock collar on your child. This product may work well for others but not for us!!!!!"
2,Functions as promised but ineffective,This product works but it is ineffective with my dog. She will bark and then yelp so I now it administers a shock. But she has learned it will not continue to shock her so she just keeps barking. This was not a good investment for my dog. I'm sure it works better for dogs that respond appropriately to the initial shock.
3,Average. Worked to an extent,"I gave this three stars because it did decrease my boston terrier's barking, but not enough. At night, she hardly barks and when she does, the barking doesn't last long. But during the day if the neighbor is out and about, she'll start barking and barking over and over and I wonder if the collar even works right. I test the collar and it seems like it takes a lot of shaking to get the thing to light up. All in all because of the collar she doesn't bark at night so much anymore which is satisfactory. I think it would actually work better if my dog wasn't so possessed."
1,Very disappointing product!,"First, the enclosed battery was dead, and as it was a special type, I had to run all over looking for a replacement. Then, the product still would not work! Could not return this piece of junk fast enough! Amazon was awesome! Credited my account Immediately, even before they received the product back! Save your money. I would advise buying this item locally."
1,Please do not waste your money,"I bought this collar for my toy poodle who barks uncontrollably whenever someone knocks on the door. When I put this collar on him, I saw the red light flash which is supposed to indicate the collar is buzzing. The directions explain that the collar will automatically adjust its intensity level if the dog continues to bark. The problem is there are only four levels so if you have a dog that requires a higher level of intensity in order to work, then this collar will not work for your dog. I tried the collar at least five or six times to be sure the highest setting was being activated and still, he continued to bark as if he felt nothing. I will never waste my money on this type of product again."
5,Works pretty good,"It works just as the instructions say. Don't listen to the PETA heads. Training a dog not to bark while you are not there is impossible without a device like this. And a quiet dog doesn't go the pound. When initisally corrected, our dog yelped, but it is not causing any damage. Effectiveness varies with the stubborness of the dog. Ours figured out how to twist the corrar around to a less sensitive area so he can tolerate it longer (and thus bark longer), but the collar wins in the end. Short of surgically implanting it, there is no way I can think of to stop the twist, so this is not the manufacturers issue.After a couple of weeks, our dog is much quieter and everyone is happier."
1,It doesn't work,I was excited to get this product as one of my dogs barks constantly and I can't even leave the house with him in the yard because I don't want neighbors to complain. The collar doesn't work. The battery is new and it simply does nothing. Very disappointed to say the least.
1,Quit working after one week,"Collar worked for a few days, dog stopped barking. Seven days later, the device quit working. ""Made in China"" should have been my first clue that this was not going to be a well made product."
5,It really works!,"We have three dogs, two big one small. The neighbors hated the barking and would call the police to complain. We bought three collars, the two big dogs stopped barking almost immediately. Now they bark only rarely, but snort and whine when they would typically bark. The little dog - she literally screamed as if she were being killed by the darn collar. We only had it on her once. She still barks - so we are looking for one without so much zap to it -But it really works - I am impressed."
1,Does not work,I am a dog professional and I know how to properly fit a e-collar on a dog. This product does NOT work as advertised. Had to return it. I'm surprised and dissappointed at Innotek ....they are usually a good company to choose.
4,Worked for my medium sized dog.,Collar worked great for my med. sized dog. Just the threat of the shock prevented her from barking even when she wasn't wearing the collar. I bought it to stop her from barking at other dogs during walks. Otherwise she doesn't bark much while in the house. It was enough for her to get the idea. The only problem would be when she shaked the shocker would rotate to the side sometimes. I could tighten it down but didn't want to make it uncomfortable or choke her either.
1,does'nt work,"I bought this collar at my local petco, I liked that it was not sound activated and it was rechargeable. I put it on my dog, she is a 60lb yellow lab. She was not bothered by it at all and barked away. I followed all the company directions to no avail and then called Innotek. My call was answered quickly the representative was polite and took my information then sent out a replacement unit asking only that I send back this unit, post paid by them. However my dog still ignores the replacement collar. I have another innotek collar that is radio controlled, my dog respects that one although it doesn't have much range, I think it's there cheapest model.I also tried another brand bark collar off the internet, cheap. It worked but it was sound activated and my other dog set it off or her tags hitting her food bowl could set it off. I would put it on occasionally, but it ate batteries and soon fell apart."
2,"Good Anti-Bark System, Bad Actual Collar","I bought this collar for my German Shepherd and it worked great. My neighbors complained about his barking and this collar stopped his incessant barking right away. My neighbors were happy, I was happy and it was a great product at a great price... Until he somehow got the collar off, chewed it and crushed the box (it was destroyed). If they could put the box on a better collar it would be a 5 star item. This dog is 2 years old, has been through 4-6 different collars (while growing) and never even touched any of them. When I contacted the company they said it was ""User error"", since I am a certified dog trainer and am very familiar with dog collars and how to properly put them on/ use them, I tend to disagree."
2,InotecBark Collar,This Innotek AntiBark collar worked wonderful for a week and than it started rattling and now it only works when it wants to :(
5,Works Great!!,"I bought this product to quiet my golden lab. He would sit outside and bark a very high pitched, excited bark, at everything - all day long. If I went outside, he'd be quiet, but who has time to sit with the dog all day??When this collar arrived, I put it straight onto the dog. He barked about 5 times, figured out he didn't like the result and has been quiet ever since. He's also alot less hyper than before. I suspect if I take the collar off, he'll remain quiet. But if he starts up again, the collar will be put right back on.Excellent product!"
4,Collar truly works,We bought this collar to shut our yippy little Sheltie from constant noise making. The first few barks and resulting corrections surprised her so much she now knows that if we put the collar on her that she doesn't want to bark and life is much quieter now. Even suggesting that we put her collar on now has an effect! My only concern would be that the correction could be a bit too strong for more sensitive dogs. The instructional dvd was very nice to have instead of just paper instructions.
1,INHUMANE CANINE TORTURE DEVICE,This collar made my poor dog scream and yelp in agony. The more he screamed and yelped the more the collar shocked him. I couldn't get it off fast enough. My my poor boy seems to be traumatized at the moment. Buyer beware...this device is far too powerful for small dogs. I really regret putting this device on my dog. DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOUR SMALL PUP...IT WILL HURT HIM!
2,Dog Collar,The barking Collar helped at first but the batteries went dead after a few days. Got new Batteries and it did the same. So we don't use it anymore.
3,corgi collar,"THE COLLAR WORKS VERY WELL,EXCEPT THAT THE CORGI BARKS RIGHT THROUGH IT. IT WORKS ON MY OTHER DOGS, AN AUSSIE AND A BEAGLE. EVENTUALLY THE CORGI MUST GET IT STRONG ENOUGH, SO HE STOPS BARKING. HE'S ONLY 7 MONTHS OLD AND VERY DETERMINED."
1,not worth it,This product does not work. We have a Lab/Shepard mix and even shaved him and it still does not work.
1,Doesn't work at all!!,"Wish there was a rating lower than 1 star. I have a Border Collie that barks at everything. So I decided to order a Innotek No-Bark Collar BC-50B. I put the collar on her, she heard something and started barking - NONSTOP. For some reason the collar never activated. So I tested it to make sure it was working and it was. Then I called Innotek's Customer Service to talk to them about the problem. I was told to trim the hair from her neck around her voice box to make sure the contacts could touch her skin. So I trimmed her hair put the collar on and made sure the contacts were on her skin. She heard something started barking and once again it never activated. The little red light never came on or started to flash. I swear I think she barked more with it on. It has been a total waste of money. Invest in a $1 squirt bottle you can put water in. That's what I've done and it's helped. When she starts barking I just squirt her and say no and she stops."
3,Works as described,"I had an Alaskan malamute that would drive me crazy with his barking. As soon as I was able to make contact with his skin, this collar could do its job. I do not believe it ever trained him. I ended up giving this dog to someone that could let him run free and craigslisting this product. It works by basically delivering a shock to the dog (which seemed quite painful) whenever they tried to use their vocal cords. I was just hoping that it would fix him to where I could leave the collar off for extended periods of time, and it did not."
2,Not effective unless VERY TIGHT!,We had a different brand of bark collar until it wore out. In comparison this bark collar is not very effective at all unless it so tight on our dog's neck that it seems to nearly choke him (I guess you can't bark if you can't breath). The previous bark collar worked much much better and didn't have to be nearly as tight on the neck. I would not recommend this brand.
5,WOW! It actually works.,"We have a 1 year old Karelian Bear Dog puppy who barks at everything, endlessly. All it took was 1 week with this collar and she is cured. She's had it off for 3 days now, and I've only heard her bark a handful of times, and only a short warning bark. This is a FANTASTIC product, I am very impressed!"
3,Bargain,"It was cheap and I owned one previously, that's why I bought it again.Overall it's an O-K collar, depending on your dog. I use it for a MinPin who won't shut-it. When it decides to work, it corrects and he learns. But no matter how tight I put it on, he can always sneak out grunts, and 'huff's loud enough to annoy without any reaction from the collar. Also one shake of the head and unless you tightened it through skin, it'll dislocate itself and become useless.At this point, it's really more of an empty threat to my dog that he falls for occasionally. Maybe it's better for larger dogs, or ones that aren't so bratty."
2,Still Barking,"After reading all the reviews, I thought this product seemed great. Everyone said that they only had to use the collar a few times, and the dog picked up that they should not bark anymore. My dog just loves to bark; I know the collar is shocking him because he jumps and makes a yelping sound, but he continues to bark until the collar reaches maximum shocking capacity. When the collar is on maximum, the shock sends his 12 pound body to jump and convulse, and he makes a screaming sound that is very scary. As soon as I take the collar off (because this just seems like torture), he returns to barking. He barks at all other dogs, except for his friend dogs. This collar is a failure for my dog's barking issue."
1,no good for a week bark,my dog barks but this product does not work unless she barks load so i gave it away good buy
1,Never Worked,The bark collar never worked right out of package. Tried new battery and still not working. Very disappointed in this product.
5,Great collar,This dog collar works great. My dog barked every night ; and usually for 20-30 minutes at atime . Since using this collar she rarely barks and then only once or twice. Highly recommend this product.
1,Horrible!,"I got this collar for my terrier who is VERY stubborn and just does not listen to us! We tried everything for his loud barking at the window, he would bark even when there was nothing there and he has a very loud gruff bark!So I was hopeful that this collar would be what he needed.I put it on him and when he barked it did nothing, so I tested it and it was working just fine I tightened the collar a little thinking it was just where he was shaggy and couldn't pick up his bark.The next day I put it on him that morning and had to go to class, so my dog was home with my boyfriend and daughter.Came home and my boyfriend said the collar shocked my dog just for panting! Apparently, he was just laying down panting and the collar zapped him causing him to understandably freak out! Poor little guy...after that we got rid of the collar, its supposed to train my dog NOT confuse him!I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
2,Not Good on Large Breeds,"This collar is not strong enough for my large breed Border Collie. She continues to bark and bark. I see the collar light up with each bark and it doesn't even phase her. I thought maybe it was because she was so furry, so I shaved the part of the neck when the contacts were, but it didn't make a difference. Who knows, maybe it would be better on a smaller dog."
1,Didn't work for my dog,"I am really sorry I purchased this item. I followed the directions closely and adjust (and readjusted) the collar multiple times. I am not new to adjusting these types of collars because we have an invisible fence system and my dogs must wear prong collars daily. This no-bark collar does nothing, and my dog just continues to bark at passing dogs, mail van, UPS truck, etc. Also, that battery they show for you to order is not the correct one for this collar! I had to order the Pet-Safe Deluxe Bark Control Collar, PDBC-300, and it worked the first day I used it. It also came with an operating book and has multiple levels easily adjustable to your dog. Don't waste your money on this cheap item and go for the deluxe one that actually works."
1,Did not seem to work,"We tried to use this collar a few times. I don't know if we are not putting it on tight enough or what, but it doesn't seem to work. Too bad there isn't a way to test it. I really can't recommend it."
1,waste of money,This thing doesnt work at all...I rubbed the probes across the table like the instructions said to do and the red light came on. I made sure it was nice a snug around the dogs neck...She still barks and carrys on like always...Dont buy this product..
1,do not buy this item,I am on my third collar and it works sporadically at best. The first two collars did not work at all and were returned for replacements. I purchased additional batteries and the collars still would not work. Do not buy this product it is not reliable.
1,got two both dont work,I bought two of these collars both dont work. will be sending them back.also got extra batters for these collars .i thought were fore these collars will be seending them back also.
1,No thanks.,"Collar shocked him a total of like 3 times, did not work when he barked loudly and repeatedly. Would not recommend."
2,Didn't work consistently,"Didn't work consistently - When it did work it was great, but often I couldn't get it to activate. I replaced it once, the second time I'm returning it. I would say it was part of a bad batch, but others seem to have the same problem."
5,Works great!,This worked great on our medium sized dog. Would highly recommend for all dogs who bark when left outside. Wish my neighbor would get one for his little yappy dog.
3,"Works great, batteries are a problem","This collar is effective for both of my 25-lb mixed breeds who bark at all of the neighbors when they're out in the yard. For the next few days after wearing the collar, barking continues to be reduced or stops, then they start up again and I have to put the collar back on them.However, when batteries ran out they were impossible to find except here at Amazon and the ones I ordered don't all work. I replaced the battery in both collars and only one works - I'll have to start going through the rest of the 10-pack to see if the others work better.If the replacement batteries were easier to find and always worked, this collar would be ideal."
1,Dog has to have short hair for it to work properly,"Well occasionally it would work. Tried trimming the fur around the area where it was placed and it still didn't really work. Went off sometimes with out the dog barking, So I say buy something else."
3,So so,"I have two standard poodles. My female while in the house likes to bark for minutes at every dog passing near the property. As a result I bought this collar. It seemed to work for a while so I stopped using it on her. A month later she started barking again, so I put on the collar again. Even though the battery tested OK it doesn't seem to activate any longer when she barks."
3,Bark Collar,"We have a minature Australian Shepherd with a thick coat. When we put the collar on her, she continued to bark and bark until she yelped. It seems the gradual increase in correction did not work as described. The Collar in conjuction with verbal correction has reduced the barking."
2,Effective but fragile,"This collar is effective in controlling your dog's barking. However, the collar's buckle isn't sturdy enough and it falls off (at least off my labrador). This allowed him to destroy the collar, so I had ""barking relief"" for a little over a week."
3,It works,"When we first received the collar, we couldn't get it to work. Finally we went out and purchased another battery and then it worked. Adding on the cost of a new battery to the price didn't make it that great of deal. The collar does work when it is on the dog but it is bulky so I don't leave it on him very long at a time. We have a small dog which is why it is bulky, but on a medium sized dog would be perfect."
2,Not all that effective for an avid barker,My dog barks with little regard to the collar until it sets itself to the highest level at which times he barks in a higher pitch. He will stop briefly until the collar resets to a low level at which time the process starts over. It is too hard for my husband and children to endure therefore use of the colar has been suspended. I will be looking for another product because the barking is a big problem in our house.
1,Buy and Regret,"I did not read any pages of the book before buying it. Relying on the first two reviews, thinking that it was a great book, I bought it.Didn't take me long to realize the exaggeration on the usefulness of the book. It seems to be mixing some New Age flavor into it if you listen to the CD. Yes, I agree with later reviews. The singing was unpleasant.Next time I will wait for more reviews to be posted before making any purchase again. A valuable lesson: Pay serious attention to negative reviews especially those that comment on the actual content."
2,This Book Needs Improvement!!,"The singing is BAD!! I will not use it for meditation as I find the singing too modernized. The text of the book is below average. When it comes to visualizations, I was expecting a good look at mandalas---that is not the case here. Also there is no coverage of the origin and/or beliefs behind the mantras.A waste of money in my opinion."
1,My First and Last Book from This Author,The CD content was a real horror and the contents of the book is of little substance. What I learnt from this purchase is not to believe that every book written by a so-called Tibetan lama must be good. Wasted my time and money on this one. Give negative reviews some serious thought----they are more often right than those positive ones. I have just read the other negative reviews on this book and I agree with them FULLY.This will be my first and last purchase of any book by this author!! Would like to give zero stars if I could.
1,Save the $179 and borrow someone's PC,"When I bought Quickbooks for Mac Pro I figured there would be a few differences between the PC and Mac version but I had no idea how different! They're essentially two separate programs that even my CPA, who teaches Quickbooks for the PC, couldn't even figure out. He was lost right out of the chute, so he called Intuit and after a being on hold for 20 minutes was told that ""yep, the Mac version doesn't have many of the features that come with the PC version."" His pronouncement was that the Mac version sucks compared to the PC edition. It's not unusual for there to be minor differences between PC and Mac versions of various software programs but Quickbooks is the worst by far. If you're a Mac ranger, do your research and comparo before you buy. Sorry I spent the money!"
1,Couldn't even get it to run,"I couldn't even get this program to run. Actually, it did run on my Mac under a different username -- one with virtually nothing else installed -- but wouldn't work under my username. Calls to support were useless. I got the usual drone-type replies where they were obviously copying-and-pasting some responses that had little or nothing to do with my problem and generally didn't even relate to my operating system (OS X).Of course, having opened the product, it was too late to return it. So I was simply out the money on a product that doesn't work at all for me.Given all this, I think one star is perhaps too much. Under some conditions, the product simply doesn't work at all, and if it doesn't work for you, you will lose your money with no recourse."
2,"Not so ""QuickBooks""",MacMoney has been a premier accounting program for the Mac for years. To my dismay it is not only unsupported in OS X but is becoming hard to find printers that still support Classic so the switch was made to QuickBooks for my Real Estate and Property Management business.I followed the manual and on screen instructions for the type of business for over 12 hours only to find the system not performing as expected at which time I went to the internet and found that many others shared my frustration and ended up having to purchase a manual or hire an expert to set up their program.When I purchased QuickBooks I never expected to have to also pay for assistance to set up my company but this seems to be the norm.
1,Won't run on our new computer,"Quickbooks is the only software that won't run on our new mac. Actually it runs fine, but the license won't update, and Intuit has found a way to try and pry another $200 from us. No thanks!"
1,QuickBooks must not like Mac users,I have had such trouble registering this software it is ridiculous. I still don't think I am registered and this is after trying 5 times. I have pretty much decided to just leave the software running so it won't ask me to register again. One time I was on the phone with tech support for 1hour and 13 minutes. Every time I call I speak with someone from India and they can never fix the registering problem. I have been a QB user since the 90s and I have decided that they just hate mac users.
1,share files with Windows? Well...... sort of maybe,"Once again QuickBooks dangles promises to us Mac folk that just don't add up. If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point? Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07."
3,Not Enough Convertion Tools,I bank with BOA and they provide there customers with account download information in the Windows Quicken format. There is no conversion mechanism in Quickbooks Pro Mac for this. It has conversion from Quickbooks Windows to Mac format and from Quicken Mac format to QuickBooks Mac but it doesn't have the functionality to convert from Quicken Windows to Quicken Mac or to Quickbooks Mac.I am disappointed that Intuit can not come up with a single format using XML as a standard that can be readable to all of it's software.I have not been able to check out other features of the product because I will either have to subscribe to a premium service from my bank to download my transactions directly from there server to the software or manually enter my account information.
3,DOES NOT WORK WITH OS X 10.5,"Received said product and loaded it on to the mac. Product code came up as invalid. I called Intuit and they said 2007 does not work on OS X 10.5 or later. My box even came saying it worked on 10.4 or LATER, and it had a sticker saying it worked on 10.5! It doesn't work on 10.5, I called."
1,UGGHH! Stick with the PC version if you can!,"Wow! What a disappointment. I moved over from QBPro 2003 for PC to QBpro 2007 for Mac. I thought I was moving forward, but it is a huge step backwards. The functionality and feature set of the Mac 2007 version are way behind what I had on the 2003 PC version. Printing reports and customer statements is a joke! The window layout is amateurish with no sense of function. What happened, Intuit?"
3,Layout Designer is a joke,"Don't expect the layout designer program to finally allow you to simply produce clean, professional invoices. I have spent hours formatting an invoice and still cannot adjust column sizes. This sub-program needs ALOT! of work to be practical."
3,Not so simple.,"It will serve the purpose I bought it for, but it is not made for simpletons like me. I am just glad they made one for Mac users. Thanks Intuit!"
2,No payroll,"For several years I used QB for Windows, but for the past couple I didn't use it and in the mean time all my Windows machines died or were replaced by Macs. So I got QB for Mac. One of the two major things I need it for, payroll, is not supported on the Mac. For those who don't know, the payroll feature is not just about paying employees (I have none but myself,) it's also about knowing how big a check to write to yourself based on what was on invoices; computing withholding; printing your check and the withholding checks to send to state and federal gov't; printing a W-2 at the end of the year; getting a breakdown on exactly what you were paid for. None of this is available on the Mac version. That is absolutely incomprehensible to me.On the bright side, it did cost more than the Windows version.I'm so angry at Intuit I will probably not even use TurboTax again."
2,Not as good as QuickBooks Windows experience,"We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's. We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting. QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison. If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable. QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company). Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application. We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense. We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically. We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll."
2,Registration takes forever!!,"Registering most software is a process that has been streamlined until it is mostly painless. Not so with Quickbooks Pro for Mac. After buying a copy, I could only open it 8 times before I HAD to register the product - the online registration process failed so I HAD to register by phone. After keying in my license info, I was put on hold for 5 minutes. The agent laboriously re-typed all of my information and tried to sell me more stuff. The agent balked when I asked to complain about this to a supervisor. The software seems OK, but Intuit's system for extracting information out of paying customers is odious and time consuming."
1,Pile of antiquated junk,I upgraded from 2005 for only 3 reasons.1) I wanted a universal binary version for my new macbook pro. 2005 had a habit of crashing every now and then.2) I wanted to be able to synchronise my address book with the OS X address book.3) I hoped that they had updated some of the antiquated interface behaviour.The result. I got none of the above.1) It still crashes. Probably more often..2) Absolutley useless. It insists on using quickbook entries rather than OS X address book entries. And given half a chance it will even screw up your address book replace correct addresses with random parts of an entry.3) Still an old fashioned piece of junk somewhat akin to my 10th grade COBOL project.
2,QuickBooks Pro 2007 for Mac,"QuickBooks Pro 2007 for Mac is a laugh. It is so archaic and totally formatted for PC Users.Mac people are visually oriented and this is classic CPA stuff without any good ideas. QBKS Pro 2005 for PC has more life and is definitely more tuned into what the Mac version should be.If I hadn't heard good things about the 2009 version finally coming up to where Intuit should have been, I would never have bought another thing from them. 2009 version is great, still needs some tweeking but is very close to the older formats they had before Intuit left the Mac clients on the lurch way back when Apple was having trouble before Steve Jobs came back."
1,Not able to share info from Quickbooks for Windows.,"I spent hours on the phone with tech support and they still were not able to tell me how to back up my quickbooks for mac with info from quickbooks for windows. If you are trying to switch from windows to mac, look into whether you will be able to transfer your data first."
3,Very Different from The PC version,"The QB for Mac is completely different than the Windows version. If you need to be able to hit the ground running, and you used a Windows version previously, you are going to have a rough start! So, far, I do not think it is as easy to navigate as the windows version. I am new to Mac though, but still, I would have thought it would be more similar than it is. Getting my files switched from windows to the Mac was not easy wither! I had to pay MAC $100 to get my PC files converted to the Mac because it was so complicated, so be aware of that. I hope the QB for Mac turns out to be as easy to use as the Windows version, but it is looking grim. Good luck!"
1,Not done paying for it...,"We got an Intel iMac, so had no choice but to upgrade to QB 2007. Now I understand that to do payroll, you HAVE to pay monthly fees to one of two outside companies to actually do payroll. Only doing a few payroll checks a month does not justify the ~$25/month fee for us. In our older version (QB 4), you used to be able to manually input the tax withholding info and generate tax forms (941, 940, W-2) to at least use as a guideline for manually doing IRS paperwork. Now... no way. You apparently cannot bypass this step and manually enter anything in payroll. You can buy an Excel spreadsheet on e-bay to do payroll, but we are not sure how to tie that in with QB. Intuit does mention this issue in small print, but we did not understand the roadblock this would be to using QB 2007. We are not pleased."
1,Cannot adjust check layout,"QBPro only includes three check layouts without any ability to adjust individual fields on the check. This is an issue since the default voucher layout prints the $amount directly on top of the pre printed ""AMOUNT"" on my voucher check. You can move the layout as a whole, but that moves all content- which in my case is properly positioned (except for the amount). Downloading the trial version is GOOD advice - try before you buy."
3,New User QB'07,"I have just entered into bookkeeping and so far Product is doing little for me, soon to change. I will be taking a class in QB via Local Comm. College. I have done a basic bookkeeping class so I understand the basics of what is happening with the program. Intuit does seem to engender a love hate relationship with their customer base after reading posts on their ( Intuits ) support forums, it is their business model after all and not mine. The Apple version seems possibly stunted/reduced feature wise, but it is too early for me to opine about that, perhaps after my class, which will be all about the windows version I can venture a reasoned view."
4,Quickbooks Pro 2007 for Mac,"I've just started to use the software, and setting it up was very easy using the wizard. So far I have had no problems and I am pleased with its performance."
4,Keeps getting better,"I know, every year another upgrade. Well face it, that's the way it is! At least Intuit makes improvements every year (not like Microsoft!)- sometimes they are noticeable (like the very cool layout designer) and other times they are ""under the hood"" (like the export ease to a windows file and back again to a mac file). Having been a user for almost 10 years and being a major campaigner to get QB upgraded past version 4, I am so happy (and willing to upgrade yearly) that Intuit has a new found appreciation for us Mac users. The best part of this upgrade is the seamless transition for the new processors. I can use it on my G-5 and my MacBook Pro!"
5,Great Examples and Activities!,"The activities in this book are great! It gives lots of examples and even more ideas than most. The best part is that anyone can use the samples or add/take away from one of the other activities listed to create a new one. Life saver when the kids are really bored. In fact, after we did many of the suggestions, my kids read them over and came up with even more games and ideas themselves. Now - that's a switch."
2,Great camera but beware of build quality,"I purchased 2 DSC P100's recently, both of which exhibited a clicking noise in all ""shoot"" modes (camera & video), but not in review or set up modes. I suspect the problem is related to the autofocus mechanism. Sony on-line customer service was totally not helpful. Store demo cameras don't seem to have this problem. I am considering buying the W1 instead."
4,Good pocket digital but focus needs work,"I like the camera. About 2 months of use. Read reviews of focus problems - they are right about the problem. I have found that setting my camera on the ""P"" setting and selecting ""Center AF"" helps. Sony needs to address this problem. The battery last a long time on one charge even when using flash. You need to spend some time with this camera to get the most out of it. I like it enough to purchase the 7.2 megapixels and will give this 5.1 as a gift. I purchased this camera for a pocket camera and it is serving that function well."
5,Small with Great Image Quality,"After many internet research and asking friends, it came down to Canon S500 vs Sony Cybershot P100. Final decision was Sony Cybershot P100 and I was very happy with that decision. This little camera give very real image color and quality. I had a Olympus Camedia 3040 which I was very please with but carrying it around can be a hassle. with this little camera, it become a pleasure to have it around and best part is that you know you can still take nice pictures."
1,An almost 8 year old camera,"This camera was excellent when in was introduced IN 2004!!! (I still own a working DSC-W1, which has essentially the same sensor and electronics) But we are now in 2012 and compact camera technology has evolved considerably. This camera should be sold now for no more than $75, not $399. I am not even sure that Sony has still spare parts for it!"
2,Sony Cyber-Shot P-100 Focus problem,This is my second Cyber Shot camera. I was hoping this would be a giant leap forward. Technology strides forward and this camera was hoped to be much better than my last 3.2Mp version. But this is a disapointment in that the camera has trouble focusing. Right after I got the P100 I loaned it to a friend to take wedding pictures and most came out blurry. I found that it is necessary to press the shutter button slowly to achive a clear picture. Even pressing slowly to give the lense time to focus does not help always. I am highly disapointed with this camera. I wonder if there are any really good cameras of this size that are any different. Buying cameras to find out later they don't work properly is too expensive of a game for me. I don't know what I might purchase in the future. This I know it will not be another Cyber-Shot camera.
1,Horrible camera,"This camera looks great. Has all the features I want. LCD is very clear indoor, but almost useless outdoor. I took identical pictures of my kids indoor and outdoor between this camera and my 3 years old 2M Fuji camera that I paid $240 3 years ago. This camera color and sharpness is horrible compare to the Fuji. I don't think the camera is defective. I don't know why so many professional reviewers said that this is a good camera. ZDNET review gave this camera a bad grade and I saw the same problem on my camera with the one ZDNET/CNET reviewed. I had the camera setting on automatic. I didn't want to play around with the setting because all I want is a point and shoot camera. Maybe there's a manufacturing problem with this camera? If you want to buy this camera, make sure you can return it w/o incuring the re-stocking fee."
4,The kids love it,"My kids (ages 6 & 7) have so much fun with this DVD. They don't even realize the math skills they are learning. It's a great way to get some activity in when we are stuck indoors. As their mom, I enjoy watching them, too, and sometimes join in."
2,Voice drove me crazy,"While I loved the concept of this it was disapointing. It looked and felt like someone made this at home, with oddly filmedangles and awkward interactions. Ms. Carrie's voice drove me insane! Her poorly executed faked enthusiam actually inspired anger in me bc I can't believe anyone thought she sounded motivating or even fun. I can handle fake enthusiasm as that's expected with practically any exercise DVD, but this made me feel borderline suicidal. I gave it two stars instead of one bc it is a good concept and bc if your kid will do it then some exercise is better than none. Just really poorly executed in my opinion."
2,Oh My,"The concept is brilliant but the production is horrid. The woman leading the children has such a forced enthusiastic happiness I couldn't stand listening to it, much less doing it. We did it once but will be taking it to Salvation Army because it is so very annoying."
4,GURPS Imperial Rome,"""Imperial Rome"" was the first true GURPS world book that I had ever read (unless you count ""Ice Age"", which I don't). I had listened to a series of lectures about Rome before, and I wanted to see just how accurate the GURPS book would be.When it came to historical information, the book seemed to be spot on. The book even contained a timeline showing major events that occurred during the Empire's turbulent history, up through the fall of the western portion of the Empire in 476 A.D. The book also contained a good deal of information about gladiatorial games, chariot races, life as a legionnaire, and descriptions of how the legions changed over time. Of course, it also contained suggestions for roleplaying different situations as scenarios in the game, and how you might integrate magic into a quasi-Roman campaign.Overall, I would say that if you want to play a campaign based in Rome or a similar culture, this would be an invaluable aid."
2,Good or Bad?,"I like the cookbook. However, there are a few things that I'd much like to see in a revised edition. First and foremost, nutritional values. There aren't any in this book. For anyone who is dieting and trying to stay frugal, this isn't the book for you. The recipes use alot of meat, cheese and everything has alot of butter and all pans are ""greased"" first.The book reminds me alot of the recipes grandma used to make. I loved them. I still do and this book is good. However, my waist-line and cholessterol don't.If you like your basic old fashioned recipes then order it. You'll love it. If you're looking for something new and healthy, this isn't the book for you."
4,Help for young bachelors,"As the mother of four great young men ages 17 to 25, I highly would recommend this book as a great graduation gift, if not from high school , then from college. The guys in my family are eligible young bachelors that grew up in a family of 6. They know the importance of frugality, reached a new level as they began set up living away from home at jobs and at home. Many of these recipes they grew up on and many more offer new tastes with economical, simple and quick methods of getting the meal on the table. The ÒKISSÓ , ( Keep It Simple, Sweetie) approach appeals to them. Basic recipes for scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes, as well as delicious and easy recipes like Beef Taco Bake or egg-less crazy cake, a favorite of mine, will be a great help when Moms not around. Nathaniel, the senior at our house already owns my original copy. Daughters can use a copy,too. And by the way, wouldnt you like to meet an eligible young bachelor who can cook for himself and shop frugally?"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I agree with the reader from Corona that the recipes use a surprising amount of shortening, refined sugar and meats such as bacon, which is frequently used as a flavoring. I eat a restricted diet, and will not be able to use many of these recipes.For those wanting to move toward a ""whole foods"" diet while still cutting grocery bills, consider the More with Less Cookbook instead."
2,Disappointed,"This book is full of good recipes and ideas to save money. However it is *not* a low fat, low sugar diet. The ideas to save money offer nothing new over ""The Complete Tightwad Gazette"". I found, once I received the book, that I could not use it."
1,Not for vegetarians,"I was very disappointed in this book since the customer reviews were so good. However, there were very few recipes that would appeal to vegetarians. Even a recipe for vegetable soup included beef bones! And a number of the pasta dishes included chicken broth, etc. Sure, I could have adjusted the recipes but then why bother doing them at all?"
5,Just like mom used to make...,"This cookbook reminds me so much of my mother. It has all the recipes that she used to make, with many more delicious options. It's so nice to have a source of simple recipes to cook from scratch that do not require gourmet ingredients. It also has lots of tips on saving money. I think it would make an excellent gift for a newlywed couple that didn't have much money. This would be a valuable resource for them."
4,"Easy, truly frugal cooking","These days, too many recipes featured in magazines and cooking shows are ""gourmet"" - expensive and time-consuming. This book is different. It offers easy, money saving recipes and even some Jar Mix recipes for gift baskets. It is perfect for the cook who has to get good food on the table while staying within a budget. I think students, homemakers, single parents and anyone on a tight budget who wants to eat well would especially like this book. The only part that disappointed me was the meat section, which was just not as comprehensive as I would have liked. For example, there are no ground meat recipes that I could find. Ground beef is low cost and can be used in dozens of recipes. Also, crock pot cooking, a frugal and easy option, is not listed. However, this book is still well worth purchasing and anyone who uses it regularly will save money."
1,Give it a miss,"I returned this book. Though the author cautions that home-made candy can be more expensive than store-bought, the book is heavily weighted toward candy and sweets. I found it of no use for actually making nutritious family meals."
4,great for make-it-yourself frugal cooking,"This is a fantastic cookbook for anyone looking for a comprehensive guide to make-it-yourself recipes. Ms. Kellam's cookbook is packed full of easy to follow recipes for everything from hot dog buns to pancake syrup! It would take you a long time to collect all of the handy recipes she provides in this complete book! She has a humorous style to her writing and includes other tips for the kitchen as well! The book is great for beginners and pros alike, in my opinion.Another review I read for this book mentioned disappointment that this cookbook was not full of low fat recipes, but it never claimed to be! I think Ms. Kellam does a great job providing wholesome, family style, FRUGAL meals! I found this to be very different from the Tightwad Gazette books as well.My only complaint? I notice the book is written towards women."
5,A must have!,"I have used this book at least once a week since I purchased it! The recipes are quick, easy & yummy! I've also made Christmas gifts with the non-food recipes ---- I loooooove this book!"
3,Not many beans at all...,"Lots of quick and easy recipes, but not very nutritious. I liked that there were lots of basics included in the book, I guess I was just hoping for too much in wanting it to have more healthy recipes as well. I do use the book when I want to whip up a good easy dessert with ingredients I have on hand and enjoy the hints as well."
1,Too shallow and simplistic,I bought this book recently but after a few pages it just became too simplistic in its content and I began to wonder whether it was even worth the effort to write such a book unless of course you can make some money from sticking a few ideas down on paper. It appears that hardly any serious reserach and investigation had been done to support the thesis. Waste of money as it could be sped read in the bookshop in about 5 minutes and you would learn just as much as you would from buying the book.
4,Simple and provocative,As an educator I found in Mr. Pink's book a new way to look into my practice. A lot of fresh ideas pop up into my mind as I turned the pages. Easy to read and provocative.
1,Good Content but you can get the message from Chapter 1 Only!!!!,"This is a well written book with many interesting stories and ways of delivering the message but the fact remains that there was only 1 message in the book and by the time you read the first chapter, you get the message. I read the first half of the book before I decided that it was a collassal waste of my time because I needed to participate in a discussion event at B-school. No one could tell that I only read half the book because the chapters did not progress in content. And what was worse, I had several classmates who only browsed sections of the book and were also able to effectively participate in the conversation. Not worth the time to read the entire thing!!!"
1,"this bookwas so thoughtprovoking, it was madening.","The chapter on abundance,asia,and xxx was actually somewhat confused but Insightful. The left brain right brain discusions were old hat. But his contention that Right brain cognitative processes are the salvation of the western world is so far beyond left feld(in foul territory) that only Gore would believe.""Left brained"", word based thought is what seperates humans from aninimals. It also led to western civilization, including the age of reason, the industrial revolution, modern agriarian reform,Information technology, Democracy, Motherhood, the atom bomb and the pursuit of Hapiness. What this country needs is more and better left brainers. smoke if you like."
2,critique,"To me, this author has it backwards. If we are moving back to the emotional age, we are in trouble. The only way we have of breaking out of the present dilemna is to use the logical, or problem solving part of our brain to forge ahead. John"
4,A Insightful Look to How Valuable Will Be Created,"I have always been a big fan of Emotional Quotient. This book deals with the shift in the world from a left side of the brain to a right side of the brain. The author does this with creating a new reality through more of an emotional and intuitive approach. As some of the simple, yet complex skills are being outsourced to other places in the world, the employee must adapt with creativity. The people who have the ability to sense and see that which is not yet will be the most valuable workers in the coming generations. The book deals with the theory but one of the best aspects is the practical section at the end of each skill. The author provides some helpful resources to follow up with on implementing the talent. One of the most interesting sections is on how to see empty space. He will give books to read that will help with reading people and emotions and how to create and craft a story. The book is well written and a good read."
1,waste of money,"Average reviewer rating of four and half stars notwithstanding, anyone interested in this should read the negative reviews. I wish I did."
5,Fresh and clear.,"I appreciate the easy-to-read style of the important information in this book. I liked the way that Pink made clear the way that he defines his senses and gave exercises to develop those senses. His argument, or, as he would like to say, his story was cogent and his textual evidence is not disputable."
3,"Hopeful story, shaky foundation","Current knowledge of the anatomy [structure] and physiology [function] of the human central nervous system does not support the facile right brain/left brain dichotomies so overused in popular diagnoses/prognoses of our psychosocial potentials/pathologies. However, viewed as metaphor, the 'Whole New Mind' is a hopeful reminder that any viable future requires intentional/intensive collaboration between those who excel in logical/analytical skills and those who practice relational/creative skills. Pink further advises that we should focus on developing both skill sets in every individual."
4,Left me with a whole new mind!,"While the notion of left-brain vs. right-brain wasn't new, Daniel Pink explores in depth, the implications of the differences. I particularly liked this book because it put a new perspective on many things that I used to find irrational or random. Rather, I see these as reality and logical progressions now. This in turn, has provided me with a broad framework within which to connect dots that I would have otherwise dismissed as arbitrary because they were not on the same plane.It's kind of left me with a whole new mind. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has to constantly deal with different individuals and personalities - whether at work, home or in social contexts."
5,great guy great book,;loved his interview about view creativity differently Daniel Pink is a lovely new author and looks forward to life being more creative and less about cash! love it
3,Strictly Philosophy Type of Read,"I got the unabridged audiobook. This book is a philosophical read only. It gives you plenty to think about but is not a self-help book with a GPS to utopia. Some parts will resonate, while other parts will cause a Spock-like raising of the eyebrow. One example is when he discusses ""laughing clubs"". I have heard of these and knew people that had bosses who did this. I find these laughing clubs...well....laughable. If you are a right-brained artist hoping for a book that will tell you how to earn a successful living, this is not it. If you enjoy the challenge of hearing other viewpoints, then you may enjoy this book and even learn a few things.The author is articulate and easy to listen to if you choose to get the audio."
3,New leadership is about emphaty and creativity,"A must read. As we are exiting the Industrial Age, Pink says, we are entering the Conceptual Age. High Concept and High Touch are the keywords, describing this from six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning. Highly inspiring with practical exercises. In short: ""People who rely on logic and philosophy and rational explanations let the best part of their mind languish"" (William Butler Yeats)."
2,Daniel Pink's Attempt to Change the World,"As a dominantly left-brained thinker, Daniel Pink's book, A Whole New Mind, Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future, sent chills through my confidence. His theory states left brained thought processes will be accomplished faster and more efficiently by computers or stolen by outsource recipients. I thought this book was a new type of thinking, but redundant and too abstract for the time. Pink mentions six senses that give a competitive edge, only two of which even remotely relate to the topic at hand. Read this book for information purposes, not pleasure. It was an easy read, but was not engaging; by the seventh chapter I was bored."
3,"Compelling information, little application","Pink's premise: Business leaders seeking an edge in our competitive, tech-saturated world will require skills like design, empathy and storytelling to put their products and services out front. But the author's prescription for developing these sensibilities--like taking a drawing class or walking a labyrinth--are a bit pie-in-the-sky. Let's face it: attending a ""Laughter Workshop"" won't help me design the next iPhone. Still, the book has some interesting insights and anecdotes, like the inner-city, design-focused high school that has helped kids overcome major socio-economic obstacles."
3,the book didn't impress me as much as I expected it would.,I bought this book for a book study class and was disappointed. I cannot recommend it to my friends or family.
4,Simple read on a great thought,I've heard Pink speak before on this topic and it brought me to the book. I love the concepts and think it hold the future of our workforce in it's words. I was expecting a bit more meat from the book vs the speach but what I got instead was a series of exercizes and resources that may proove helpful in my own working future.
4,Wonderful Tips to Change Your Thinking,"I'm surprised at how some people are blaming the book for not going deeply enough into the economic challeges facing the U.S. Folks, this book isn't ""The World is Flat"" or ""The Post-American World."" The author does a fantastic job of giving us an OVERVIEW of the challenges and then providing practical advice on how to expand your thinking. The book challenges readers to get outside their comfort zone and grow. He's never going to be asked to testify before Congress on his views, but I think he should be! His ideas about the way we need to change American education are thought-provoking."
3,Okay,"This book was educating. Not very enlightening but it was a good read. Right brain thinkers would probably find most of it rather dull. I am a right brain thinker and I did, but it did confirm things that us right brain thinkers have been knowing since birth."
4,Quality,"Anyone remember reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? The whole left brain versus right brain discussion could easily have been inspired by that book.In particular, in Zen there is the Quality question. Science versus art, the rational versus the irrational.Once you have had a taste of Mr. Pink's version of this type of thinking, it may be worth it to go back to Zen and read it again.Zen is 20 years old this year. Good time to celebrate it."
3,Glib Trendy Dangerous Nonsense,"The author is clearly a leftist (he refers to Pat Buchanan as ""an ultraconservative fringe candidate"") and like all leftists he doesn't just misunderstand human nature -- he doesn't understand it at all. A perfect example: he claims IQ accounts for only five percent of a person's success. Apparently he just made that statistic up, because there is no truth to it. Half the people in this country have IQs of less than 100. They are not going to doctors or lawyers or the author's designers. They're going to be blue-collar workers. What are the supposed to do today with corporations (creations of they government) exporting jobs to the Third World? Deliver pizzas? Be security guards? The author did diagnose current problems, but anyone can do that. His prescriptions are worthless -- trendy, feel-good, dangerous nonsense."
3,Book condition,"Overall the book was in good condition, however, a LARGE and unneeded sticker was plastered on the outside cover of the book that detracts from the book. Why glue something on a text that cannot be removed. It was not even glued on straight. The inside of the book was fine."
1,Oversimplified - Not Worth Reading,"Pink is correct - Abundance, Asia, and Automation will be hard on those with left-brain, analytical skills. However, these factors will also make the future difficult for Americans with right-brain skills as these can also be performed by Asians or automation at low cost.Even those with high touch skills are vulnerable - look at the increasing range of jobs being performed by illegal Mexican. At first it started with farm and domestic labor, then on to fast-food and heavy construction labor. Now they increasingly are employed operating machinery and performing carpentry, painting, carpentry, rug-laying, etc. At the same time, President Bush wants to open truck driving to countless Mexican citizens as well. Perhaps the only Americans really safe, even with high-touch skills, are reporters needing a good command of English."
4,"In the process of Reading, but so far so good",I was referred to this book by a colleague. I have heard lots of good things about it. The vendor got it to mein a timely manner and it was in the condition specified when purchased.
5,A Whole New Mind,I found Daniel Pink's writing style and reporting on the emergence of right brain thinking as a necessity for the economic future of employment in our society to be valuable. His approach embraces the necessary changes with curiosity and enthusiasm. I also appreciated his method of first-person experience with the six senses he proposes as needed to succeed in this new economic age.
5,Makes you think. Plenty of references to additional material,"This book is great for the times we live in now.As the dot com boom/bust settles, this book is throws a lot of light on ways to train your brain to tap into its creative potential.It doesn't take an ""either / or"" argument, it's an argument of complimenting the left and right sides of your brain, into a ""whole new mind"".It lists many simple exercises and points the reader to many other publications that will speed the process along.Very uplifting and highly recommended."
3,whole brain thinking 25 years later,"I wanted to like this book because I agree with his premise. He states that the likely next evolutionary step is for civilzation to revere the conceptual as opposed to the industrial or agricultural. And those who don't get on board will be left out in the cold as that which can be programmed (i.e., anything logical and linear) is digitized or outsourced. But, a primary domain in which all this evolving occurs is business. And business DOES rely on logic and is still run by what he calls L-directed people. I'm not so sure that they will run to find a labyrinth on which they can walk or a laughter club like the one he found in India, as he suggests. The book is a fun journey into the now-dated concept of whole brain thinking (published i 1984, William Morrow.) If hemispheric thinking concepts intrigue you, this book is a good review or introduction."
2,A Dried and Satly Fish Smell,"Hey. I am one of the more right-side-of-the-brain people, and I honestly don't like this fishy smelling book. I sincerely could not say exactly why except maybe because I'm just not into ruling the world. Also this book reads too much like dry history or business textbooks I read in the 70s. They too had a dried and salty fish smell from too many assumptions. After hurting my jaw trying to chew on this book for one day, my stomach began to hurt, and I finally tossed this book back into a public library building. It's too young or too dead to have enough meat on it, or to be be digested well. If you need more of a 'left-brain' review than this one, you could read other ""I don't like"" this book contributions. I ditto them."
1,Boring,"A better title for this book would be ""Things You Realize Just By Paying Attention."" This is easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author tells you nothing that you haven't already learned by paying attention to marketing and media for the past decade and a half. Not only that, he does so without humor or what I consider to be a narrative flow. I made it just over halfway through the book before I gave up."
2,More technotrash pseudo-fiction,"First let me state that the terms ""technotrash pseudo-fiction"" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff."
5,A top pick for business and general-interest libraries alike,"For decades the key to surviving in the world has been left-brain thinking with careers keyed to lawyers, accountants and engineers. The future, former White House speechwriter Daniel Pink maintains, is in right-brain thinkers - designers, teachers, creative and empathic professions: A WHOLE NEW MIND tells how to stimulate and use right-brain thinking for maximum profit and achievement, and this audio receives a fine reading by author Pink himself. A top pick for business and general-interest libraries alike."
5,A new direction...,"I'd say this book is necessary for the next generation of workers in America. It provides a new direction for living at the next level of consciousness beyond survival. Though the left brain has gotten us to abundance and automation, it is the right brain that will help generate differentiating ideas for a generation to come. In a world where information is freely available, the information and all the left brain techniques used to manipulate, store and retrieve it are no longer a differentiator."
3,Why so much more than the print book?,"I want to read this, but it doesn't make sense to me that an electronically transferred book is so much more than the current paperback price. I won't buy the kindle edition till the price drops."
3,"Upbeat, but overly simplistic view of globalization","Pink is absolutely right: creativity and innovationwill be a boon for post-industrial, post-informationage workers now that countries like China and Indiacan produce cheaper knowledge workers.However, the economics of supply and demand will simplydo the same to this new conceptual age worker thatit did to programmers and MBAs.Once the economy is flooded with talented designers andcreative personnel, the market will correct and wageswill fall. And many creative and brilliant ""whole brain""workers will become yet again another glut of talent.In the end, the market favors no whole class of worker butrather the most unique and talented of a class. And thishas always been the case."
3,More Interesting Than I Expected!,"I never would have chosen to read this book on my own accord. It was assigned for a class (which I found rather strange since it did not directly correlate with the subject, since it is a more of a business book than anything else). Still, I did enjoy it more than I thought it would. In the style of _Freakonomics_, the majority of its facts were anecdotal and fascinating. Suggested activities and websites made it an interactive and modern book."
3,"3 A's...Asia, Automation, Abundance...oops!","Pink's 'theory' rests on the assumption that the US has excessive wealth. As of this review, Feb. 2009, most Americans are sobering up to the fact that is not, and has not been, a reality for along time.Given that is a central premise of the book, some of the other ideas start to fall, people will no longer buy $18.00 fly swatters because it has a designer label or 'story' behind it.On the up side, his warning about 'investing' your career in techniques that can be automated is true and will only increase with time. Therefore, if someone is in a profession subject to this, they need to cultivate creative or 'right brain' aspects of their career - ones that cannot be duplicated by computer, machine or outsourcing.His point that wealth has not create happiness is again, valid, as is the creative opportunities to create meaning in life."
4,Must be read in Portugal!,"A Book which should be read by everybody in Portugal . Mainly by the politicians.Daniel Pink makes evident that the Information Society is the past to the west. The dazzling growing of India (and China in a nearly future) in IT will absorb all the world necessities of IT development. The future, Daniel Pink says, is in the right side of the brain: the one who does not labors with mathematic but with creativity and sociability.I sincerely hope Portuguese Prime Minister to read this book!"
5,Great!,"Everyone should read this book! I've used this book in multiple settings. It's helped me (personally), and it's challenged others. Pink gives real, tangible ways for people to apply the tenets of the book."
4,A New Way To See The World,"Our schools and work places have taught us that we must be analytical and use the left side of our brains. Daniel and the research he presents has revealed there's another way to go about work. Using the right side of our brains.The book was well thought out and explained thoroughly the differences between left and right brain usage. While I knew there was a big difference between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, much of this was new and a breath of fresh air.If you're interested in the changing dynamics in the work place, you'll want to snag a copy of this book. The insights are revealing while not being mind blowing."
3,Meh.,"Not terrible. Not great. While I agree that right-brainers will become more useful because of automation, I feel that Pink essentially equating Asians with automation was a little short-sided. The reason that large numbers of Asians have become skilled at left-brain type jobs is because that is what the market calls for. When the market shifts to require more right-brainers, Asia will start producing more right-brain workers. As long as they can do it cheaper, they will continue to take American jobs. The implication that Americans are somehow better suited to right-brain tasks is a tad on the racist side."
3,Way out there,I feel that I will need to listen to this book 2 or 3 times in order to grasp the concept. It is so much to think about.
3,nice but lacks something,"I have read this book rather easily. I liked the writing style, but I lacked the content. Even though the idea was presented great and the concept of ""theory meets practice aka tips"" I missed the content. It feels like reading a blog, not the book."
4,Toward skills that cannot be outsourced,"Pink genially prods us into a future of retooling ourselves for survival, managing to make it seem more interesting than horrifying. He gets playful advising games to develop creativity and empathy, moving us towards the kind of skills that can't be outsourced. The challenges he covers are real and inescapable, except that it's happening so fast that Pink's correct predictions seem outdated for being made slightly before they happened."
4,Good Book,"Interesting commentary. I enjoyed this book and partially bought in to its' concepts. Yes, I believe there are valid points but I question the utility of the references. There are books and activities that I do not feel will increase ""right-brain"" power."
5,Engaging read,"This is a great read, especially for someone who works in both an analytical and creative capacity. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Easy read and fun to learn from Pink's observations,"This book was very fun to read. I also enjoyed the idea that those of us who are more ""right brain"" than ""left brain"" thinkers have an excellent opportunity to be more valued in the coming years....I liked this book so much that I have already bought and given away 10 copies and am ordering more.Great job Mr. PinkToni Cordell"
3,Often Interesting but an Over Valued Perspective,"Dan Pink does well to highlight the importance of developing abilities that utilize the oft-ignored right side of the brain. However, even though he speaks of a whole minded approach to life, his emphasis often swings clearly to the right-brained activities to the point of seemingly devaluing left brained activities. There is a good deal of value in the information and insights he provides. These just would have been better utilized if his approach was more balanced."
2,Should Have Been a Pamphlet,"Like far too many books, A WHOLE NEW MIND really could have been a pamphlet. The book does contain a few good ideas, but nothing that really warrants an entire book. This is a disappointing follow-up to Dan Pink's first book, FREE AGENT NATION, which is more of an eye-opener that is worth the read."
2,Premise is flawed and dated,"The author is on the bandwagon that a MFA is the degree of the future and that we can protect our jobs from being automated or offshored by learning to Design Beauty, Tell Stories, Compose Symphony, Show Empathy, Plan, and find Meaning. One of his foundational examples is a quote from GM that they are a design company that happens to make cars. While that was a great argument in 2004, they are also a failed company that required a government bailout. Overall, it is an interesting and thought provoking book, even if I do disagree with his conclusions."
3,He's trying really hard,"I haven't read the entire book yet, but so far, the author seems intent on convincing everyone that he is a right brain thinker by forcing analogies and focusing more on creative fluff than actual content. The first 20 pages people should have learned in a basic psychology class, or even high school physiology. I'm hoping the content sections are better."
4,A Whole New Mind,This is an excellent book to give to young people starting out. Left brain thinkers are coming to the for.
5,Great Design great service on Order,"Saw this design 10 years ago. Did not buy than and have been looking ever since. Evey one said it had been discontinued.Found it at this store on line.Price was right, delivered regular mail in 3 days across country. Exactly what I wanted and looks even better than I remembered."
3,Gourmet Setting Cocktail Forks,I like the forks but didn't realize they were black on the bottom. There's also a couple of scratches on some of the forks. :(
1,Commando Krav Maga,"A number of reputable Krav Maga organizations have denounced these DVDs as being a ""scam"" and raised serious questions about the validity of the claims made about the author's service in the Israeli Defense Forces (the IDF, in particular the Special Operations forces of the IDF). The British Krav Maga Association (BKMA) has an interesting article about this program, which should be read by Amazon and prospective buyers of these DVDs."
4,Loved it,"Really liked the moves that I saw, practiced them right away. Only disappointment was the partner he used to work out with, and the length. Just wish he would have showed a bit more ya know, didn't see a downward stab block which i really wanted to."
1,This book does not approach anything resembling humor.,"One day, walking back from school, I picked this book up off the sidewalk near a local elementary school. This book depicts single cell cartoons without accompanying text of people being the victems of ""bizarre crimes"". Stupid stuff like people's car tires being blown up with helium and floating, peoples beds being made into peanut butter and jelly sandwitches, etc (these are actual examples.) Although I can only hope this book was targeted towards children, I doubt this book would amuse even a three year old. You'd have to get someone really, _REALLY_ stoned to get them to laugh at this book. It's not even fun to make fun of. Just... bad."
5,Great Classic!,"A great old movie, illustrates the genius of Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster! Not to mention the other talented actors and writers of the time. I enjoy this movie."
2,Good Movie - Lousy Artwork,"I'm not about to knock the movie ""Trapeze"", however MGM seriously needs to put a bit more effort towards the packaging artwork for this title and others in this particular line of recent releases.When I first ordered this I figured the actual cover art must not have yet been available to the Amazon site and they were using a generic form of cover art with the MGM logo. Unfortunately it was 'as shown'.Since I operate a rental store, this affects my operation more than the average collector and I'm sure some people couldn't care less. Either way, MGM could put a bit more effort towards their product. What they are presenting here resembles that of some inferior old VHS cover art from 30 years ago."
5,Trapeze,"This is a wonderful movie, one of my favriotes actually. I can't tell you how many times I have watched it. It never gets old. It has inspired countless people to learn to fly on the trapeze, Some of todays greats inclued. If you have never seen this movie you're missing out. The first time I saw it was sitting in a circus ring after a show. Where will your first time be?"
1,Fullscreen advertised as Widescreen!,"I was really looking forward to getting this. I like the movie ...had never seen it in Cinemascope (aside from it's letterboxed titles on broadcast tv). The product description must have been written from ""imdb"" specs, rather than the actual clamshell back. When I saw ""fullscreen"" - I never removed the cellophane. The Amazon return process was painless, however. Received full credit."
1,realy a bad copy of a beautiful movie,"I could not see because the copy was so bad that it's not matter if you tried with different dvd player was not possible to see it, beside the box coming with features like subtitles that wasn't there"
1,Details are needed.,"I also agree with 'Jaime Costa' regarding info provided on amazon and specifically this DVD, has anybody bought this new edition and provide details that one would find pertinent to prior purchase."
2,horrible transfer by MGM,Don't waste your money on this MGM DVD from 2010. The transfer quality is horrible....I gave up watching after just 30 minutes.
3,This cassete is just for travler.,"If you want to study norwegian for trip this cassette might be good. But don't buy this cassette, if you really want to study norwegian. This cassette is full of simple sentences and it is only 90 minute cassette. The booklet included in is really simple such like where is station? like that."
4,For which kids???,"Clever -- very clever -- and playful -- but I wonder whether this is a book more for those adults who appreciate the cleverness than for young kids who are just trying to learn the rules of word sequences on the printed page so they can proudly say, ""I can read!"" From the brief bios of the author and illustrator on the book's jacket, it would appear that both of them have played outside the lines -- or wanted to -- and there are certainly many adults who can empathize with that impulse and who will find these visual verses a delightful reminder of childhood when the world was vivid and secure."
4,From private school to the recording studio,"This is real good stuff considering they were only 17, 18 years old and right out of prep school. If you like early Bee Gee's (Odessa) you'll like this."
4,Genesis ? Yep,"Okay...this is the TRUE first Genesis album , before ""Trespass"". A lot of people dismiss it because it doesn't ""sound"" like what Genesis was soon to become. Much shorter songs , with a ""pop"" feel. But , still Gabriel's talents shine through.....there have been many versions of this available; this is the one to get..Superior sound , full lyrics , bonus tracks. Listen to it for what it is , not for what they were yet to become."
2,Poor choice for intro book,"as a first year clinical anesthesiology resident, i was told to get this book. I wish I had saved the money for the Lange book. This book was a disjointed collection of facts that were difficult to absorb. In an attempt at brevity, they sacrificed readability. I found myself struggling through many of the chapters and was hard pressed to say I truly understood what I had just read. As I have further progressed in my reading, I feel that the authors should have explained key basic concepts rather than condense ""big miller."" Not a good beginner book...Would get Lange book and save money for the big miller or barash."
5,A Brave Hearted Woman!,Jenny Wiley is a direct decendent. I loved finding this book about my great grandmother's trials and her ultimate freedom from her captors... A true story that can encourage modern cultures... I've purchased several copies for my family. My daughter visited the Jenny Wiley State Park in Kentucky recently.
5,Taken Back In Time,"It has been quite a few years since I read this book. My grandmother owned it. I thought it was a very good book. It hit close to home to me, because Jennie Wiley is my seventh great-grandmother. Reading this book brought me close to my family history. I was able to learn more about how life was back then and the things that happened. I plan to buy my own copy, so that I can share the story with my children."
5,10W7 Subwoofer,"Got Bass? Most people will look at the price of this little dynamo and blanch - If you want excellent, clean, tight bass that will have all your friends green with envy, the W7 series subs are the way to go. I am constantly blown away with the performance. Just bought a new truck and one of the first ""accessories"" will be the addition of a JL Audio W7 sub!"
4,Good coverage - from the pros to the ordinary citizen,I liked the human interest stories. The film showed how hard an event it is for the non-pro and the pro alike. Cool aerial coverage and up close video too. Beautiful scenery too. I would recommend this film.
2,I did not like this book.,"The book Through the Hidden Door was a boring book. I wanted to read an adventure book. I thought it would be a good book to read but it was not. I felt there was not enough adveture in it. I would not recommend this book to chrilden under the age of eleven. There were some curse words in this book that they should not see. Overall the best part of the story is when Charlie and his friends walked ""Through the Hidden Door."""
2,Very flimsy,"For the price, I suppose I can't complain that much. But it really is very flimsy. Furthermore, it's actually a little annoying to adjust (not the smoothest mechanisms)."
1,This is Dollar Store Worth at Best,"Unable to find the table mate 2 and finding in a search this is the one that kept coming up.... I settled for this thinking a company wouldn't make something worse would they? Having seen the table mate 2 in use it is a nice lightweight overbed table but this thing I think maybe it's the ""classic"" is flimsy trash. It struggles to hold a small breakfast AND when you slide it it collapses the metal support rod underneath. So - garbage is what I have to say to this."
1,Table top is light flimsy plastic.,"I had an older model of this table that has a hard suface for the table top. This new one is light, flimsy plastic that I can't possibly put anything very heavy on it. Also this newer version you can't get it to absolutely level. Tha adjustments either make it drop towards the front or drop to the rear."
2,Flimsy,"This is just what was needed to assist my husband, but when he goes to move it, it isn't very stable. Not worth the money I spent as I will eventually have to replace it with something that he can move without worrying about spilling what is on the top. Would not recommend it."
2,"BEWARE! This table is NOT 17"" X 23""","I have to knock down my rating on this product quite a bit. The table top measures 21 1/2"" across and the depth is almost 15"" for the main part of the tray and only nearly reaches 17"" on the two ends on either side of it when it's facing you (see picture). Does 1 1/2"" short on the width and 2"" short on the depth matter all that much? It's certainly false advertising and we're talking about roughly 53 square inches less table space (13% less) than what was promised.The tables are ok, but beware, they are smaller than you think. I've got one of the larger, original Table-Mates which is quite a bit larger. If you can find one of those, grab it!"
1,Not Good!,I am very disappointed with this table. It is very unstable. It is made very cheaply and flimsy for what I paid for it. It refuses to stay in the standing position unless I tie it together . I wanted to put my laptop on it but its to unstable to trust . I will probably put it in a yard sale as I didn't get around to sending it back.
1,This thing is JUNK! This is NOT a Tablemate!!!!,"This thing STINKS! I own 3 Tablemate 2's and we LOVE them. Use them every single day! My dad wanted one so I ordered this one, thinking it WAS a Tablemate 2! It's NOT!!!! It is JUNK! Spend the extra money and get a REAL Tablemate 2. Not some poorly made replica!"
3,TV tray,Adequate table top but legs flex too much when weight is placed on it. You have to be careful drinks don't spill.
2,Poor quality,I have the original large Tablemate and these two smaller tables were not of the same quality. They are unsturdy and the tables are off kilter. They will have to do for now until I can find something better.
1,Adjustable T V table,"I have an older model, that is better. This table is thin ,and flimzy,bends to easily, if you rest your arms on it,. Also, smaller than i thought it was going to be."
2,Poor design and manufacture,It was flimsy and the tilt adjustment didn't lock in place very securely. I had to use cable ties to keep it from slipping out when the tray gets bumped from below by your knees. Poor design and manufacture.
4,Table mate classic,A good product for that extra little work table to have around. It works well to slide under the couch when not in use.
1,Not satisfied !,"Own ""Table Mate II"". Table Mate Classic is a cheap version. Small diameter legs, weaker plastic table. Haven't used it since I got it."
4,Good buy.......,"Serves the purpose for which it was purchased. Could be a bit stronger, stable, but a good buy for the price I paid."
2,Flimsy and smaller than expected,why do i have to add more words/ I thought flimsy and smaller was more than enough. in the future don't ask me for a review
2,Good Style,"The item I wanted, but not as sturdy as my husband's purchased several years ago. Acceptable anyway! Thanks. Constance Kritzberg"
3,TV Tray,i had purchased this same table some years back.This new purchase was not as sturdy as the first. the quality is not as good.
2,plate on the floor...,"Was not happy with the adjustable table as it is very small and can't reall work on crafts or computer. Only thing really good for would be to eat on, but be careful you move the tray in any way and your plate will be on the floor! No good support under the tray. I bought a really great one at target!"
4,love the adjustable height!,This tray is awesome for my futon sofa. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not as easy to fold up and put away as most TV trays.
2,TV Tray,The tray arrived in a timely manner but did not meet my expectations. I needed a larger tray to surround a wheel chair and lift chair. I had a loner tray that measured 19 1/2 X 25 1/2 and was more stable and was built of heaver material. So far I cannot find this model anywhere. I will use the shipped one but I know there is one out there which would be better meet my requirements.
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with the quality of the product. In the past I had purchased 2 of the same product from Bed Bath and Beyond. They were much stronger and the quality was by far better. I'm not satisfied with my purchase from you.SincerelyJay R Jensen
1,Piece of junk,Purchase price is out of hand for the quality. Packaging was poor and product was damaged. Even a child could break this one.
3,"Flimsy, but useful.","As long as I treat it gently it's worth the $20 I paid for it. There was a classier model, but I didn't think I needed it. I just use it for my laptop - wireless keyboard on my lap. Very comfortable way to do a lot of writing. Folds up easily when not needed."
1,Terrible,"I bought from table mate their original table and love it for everything from computer to eating on it. I thought this table was the same but it is not sturdy at all, has a very thin top without the pull out drink holder and the legs are not secure at all. Terrible purchase so suggest not to buy this table, THE CLASSIC.THE MEASUREMENTS ARE SMALLER AND DOES NOT ACCOMODATE AS MUCH. I suggest you buy from TABLE MATE DIRECT AND GET THE ORIGINAL."
2,Junk!!!,This table is not high quality. Cheap at come unlevel i had to bend straight. I wounted put a drink on ot.
2,Adjustable TV Tray,"This item is not nearly as sturdy as our existing TV tray that we thought we were matching. After tying the undercarriage with string to prevent collapsing,we are making do. If seen at the store it would not have been purchased for $3o."
2,Just ok,I have the first one and hoped to duplicate it. This tray is unsteady. Otherwise it works fine. You be the judge.
4,Works well,"It s perfect of what I wanted it for. A table to set my laptop on when I am on the couch. Easy to put together and does what it says it will. Adjusts for the height you want, slides easily when I want to get up or pull toward me when I sit down. When I am finished with it..it fold's down to slide behind my very tall couch. All of these features are good for me because I use a cane and it is not cumbersome."
3,TV trays,Trays are good size...but seem a little unstable. Would not work well for small children. better when used at lower height.seems that they are made out of good material.
1,TV tray won't stay up,"This is horrible. It tips over constantly and for an elderly person, it is dangerous...do not buy! And they were very pricey...bad design."
3,Had to return... :-(,"I loved the way the boot looked with jeans/pants; however, I could never wear them with a skirt because there was about an inch or more of a gap at the top where it should have been flush with my calf. I do not have abnormally skinny calfs, so this was a big let-down. I love the fact that these boots were all leather! Fine quality just not the right fit!Wish that Nine West made the same boot with a smaller upper! I'd buy em in a heart-beat!"
4,Nice looking boots,"Nice looking boots but to large in the calf area going up to the knee. The boots leave a noticable gap if your wearing a skirt, if your planning on wearing pants tucked into the boots they are perfect."
5,Very well made boots by Nine West,"The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. The leather is very soft also. Even though the toe is very pointed, these boots are still comfortable. Amazon has a great price on these boots!"
4,Nice blend of knowlege,Very nice inclusive book of all types of jewelery making.Basic understanding of designs. Would like to see a follow up of more technical techniques.Nice photos. Good descriptions for people new to the craft.
5,The Complete Book of Jewelry Making,"By Carles CodinaNot Just Another Juice Table BookThis Lark Books publication is heavy with material and not just weight. I studied with Heikki Seppa for many years. He had retired as the ""master"" in the Fine Arts Metal Department at Washington University in St. Louis. During our sessions together, his adage was ""learn one, teach one.""Carles Condina does just that. He learned his lessons well. In this well documented and illustrated book, there are lessons that he shares to be studied and learned by all.I used to marvel at the ingenious hinges, pin back, and latches that I would examine on many pieces of jewelry. How does one construct, place, and design these elements to do their trick. How does one become ""unhinged?""My strong recommendation is to get your gloves on this book. It contains invaluable information on many of the skills needed to become a heavyweight in the jewelry making arena."
5,Old does not mean out of date,I was fascinated by this book and now have a knowledge far greater than I could have imagined. It is well written and the content is a must for anyone wanting to actually make/create their own jewelry rather than just put already made pieces together. I highly recommend it.Reachout007
3,Not true to size!,"These shoes were really cute online as well as in person but they were too big; not true to size at all. So if u plan on buying them, you might want to go down about 1/2 a shoe size."
4,Great stuff,This seems to work very well but it really works better with the conditioner & the spray. I would say that it keeps my Great Dane smelling fresh for 2 weeks! Bad part it came messy like some spilled during the shipping process :-(
5,Great scent that last for days.,"This is a great shampoo. Wouldn't use anything else. Lathers good, smells great, with a scent that last for several days."
5,A Must See!,This documentary tells of the poor choices and consequences of a young Philadelphia woman and the love and support of her family. I believe this movie should be in all high schools and shown as a motivating force to help young women make better choices about their lives.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I'm doing my master's thesis on what is wrong with the death penalty system and rented this as a part of my research. While I sympathize with the story being told and in no way refute any factual part of it, this is not exactly what I would call good production values. It's very do-it-yourself with a low quality. Again, while I sympathize with the situation these people dealt with and have nothing but the utmost respect for what they went through, parts of this tell irrelevant sides to the story that have nothing to do with the woman's trial and carry on about the families tribulations outside of this situation. So it tends to lag and drag with lots of irrelevant information. It could be cut down to only about a third of the time and tell the same story and would be twice as effective. It loses the viewer's interest and focus as it is and I was expecting a more professionally made film."
2,Thick book with No Details,"If you intend on Programming in VC++ for CE, don't bother getting this one. Every time I referenced this book, the information presented wasn't worth looking it up. Burdick's is a better choice."
3,New System for Old RPGers,"If you're looking for a new RPG system, this is a great book to check out. The only down fall is that like most RPG books the information is scattered all over the place. I recommend using the internet fan-made creations when you first start playing. Even though this is an old system, there is still a strong fan-base online."
