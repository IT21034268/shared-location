5,Dewalt 7.2 volt cordless screwdriver,"This screwdriver is tough, and has an abundant amount of torque for it's size. I have used one for several years and have yet to have it quit on me. I have worn out several batteries with it and have 3 of them now. It performs better than any screwdriver of it's type that I have ever used. It's small size makes it even better. The only slight downside to it is it's speed. It could be a little faster driving screws but all of it other performance features make up for that somewhat. Overall it is an oustanding product. It is easier/almost to catch one on sale and buy a new one than it is to replace the batteries."
2,Alas !,"This was a wonderful production which I remember well from my childhood. Unfortunately, it is a very old print that could not be restored. It is a ruin, a shadow of the original.. I could not watch it until the end and in fact returned it for refund."
1,"Obviousl, whoever makes these has a problem...","I waited a few months to watch this and was really looking forward to it. It played fine, but it turned out that although the disc was labeled ""Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme"", the movie was actually a very bad print of an Italian vampire movie called ""Uncle Was a Vampire!"""
2,What Happened to the Brat Pack,"Following a fairly ordinary plot line (read humor): husband cheats, wife leaves, wife drives self into prison (metaphorically), Ally Sheedy reveals to us that the once highly revered Brat Pack's success quickly dimmed during the early 1990s. The film is packaged as an ""erotic"" film, but merely sinks into a casaul ""skin"" flick with an R rating. Watch mainly to see how far the Pack has fallen only to (hopefully) rise again, as Sheedy recently has."
4,macon county jail is fun,"great flick. lots of shooting, speeding, and a good looking woman. great soundtrack, but i can't find the tune ""pallas athena"" that's part of the soundtrack. do yourself a favor and rent or buy this great anti-establishment adventure."
3,Informative - but lacking in color illustrations,"Walk Kuhn's work was exhibited in the fall of 1967 in a gallery in New York City. This book was a companion to the show and includes examples of some of the works exhibited.Frank Getlein provides a brief, well-written and informative history of the artist, his life, roal in the Armory Show, contemporaries, technique and etc. I enjoyed this book but was disappointed with its lack of color illustraions (only two of the fifty-two examples of his work are color, cover included)"
1,Does not contain electrolyte fluid,"I did not realize the battery would be shipped ""dry"". I called the company and and they told me to go to Batteries Plus and have them fill it. I understand they cannot ship the hazardous material but it cost another $15...Next time I will go to Batteries Plus and buy the battery."
5,Paging Emma Peel,"Diana Rigg as Emma Peel is the come-on. She is magnificent. Diana (now Dame Diana) is ably supported by the genial and gentlemanly Patrick MacNee as John Steed, no one's pin up boy, but suave and polished and with a charming twinkle in his eye - a suitable light comedian. Watch for now better known names amongst the always watchable British supporting cast (Christopher Lee (already well known then),Michael Gough, Sue Lloyd, Gordon Jackson, Peter Barkworth, Anna Quayle, Dudley Sutton, etc). The storylines are amusingly off the wall and benignly camp but it's Emma Peel, stylishly clad and beating any man in a fight, whose dry wit and wry smirks give this the stamp of evergreen and inimitable entertainment."
3,Missing something essential,"A realistic story, charming and enjoyable light reading, but lacking something. I was quite disappointed."
4,Excellence,"Lisa Marie Rice is the real deal. I admit, I wasn't anxious to read the story with a foreign hero as the romantic interest, but once I started the book, I was hooked. Rice can write. What's more, she can write suspense, romance, and erotica. Rice has it all, and she delivers in 'Port of Paradise'. I'm keeping my copy."
2,Not great,"I love LMR's other books (Midnight series, Dangerous series, etc.) but this one is disappointing. The writing is jerky, the exotic locale is random and poorly fleshed-out, the conversations are stilted and, most unforgivable in a romance novel, the sex is boring. I'm starting to think LMR is a pseudonym that, like Carolyn Keene, covers several authors of varying degrees of talent. Either that or Ellora demands so many new manuscripts that quality suffers. Either way I wish I hadn't bought this one."
1,some people deserve to be alone,i hated both of these characters. she came off sounding like a snooty 100 year old professor and he was some kind of manic depressive jerk. the dialog was terrible. i wanted to smack them both....often....hard....in the face.
1,Glory's Rival,"Looks like the new authors really need to check their words. Do you think that Shining would actually be the next Ruffian? I don't think so. Do you think the Glory will be the next like, Secretariat? No way. Not a chance, March to Glory. Also, wouldn't 'Shining' be taken in the Jockey Club already?"
2,"Isn't this outta hand, here?","This book was all right but I don't really like Cindy and Glory. Ashleigh, Wonder and all of Wonder's offspring were and still are my favorite characters in the series. I don't get what's so bratty about Christina, and I don't get what's so bratty about Cindy either : well, yeah, she gets everything she wants and she always wins and so does Glory. Glory winning his first race by 20 lengths and then the Breeder's Cup by 31 lengths is unreasonable. This book is fictional, yes, but it still isn't right. The world isn't perfect."
1,Glory Sucks!,"WORST EVER! Why couldn't have Shining entered and won!? And what's with Glory beating Seartarit's record! Only Man O' War could have done that! Cindy is a BRAT! I wish they would just lose. And what's with the horses!! I mean, the only horses that I've liked are High Jinx, Perfect Image, Mr.Wonderful, Storm's Ransom, and Shining!!!!!"
3,Save the Thoroughbred Series!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. Go to www.whitebrookfarm.com and join the effort."
2,THIS BOOK IS NOT REALISTIC!!!!!,THIS BOOK IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD ONES. IMEAN ALL IT TALKS ABOUT MOSTLY IS CINDY AND GLORY AND THEIR PROBLEMS. I'LL KEEP READING THE REST OF THE SERIES BUT IDON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE ANY BETTER THAN THIS ONE WAS.
3,very funny,"i know this sounds ridiculous, but somehow i enjoy reading about Glory winning by a lot and setting a track record, etc.. and i was reading one of the reviews and i agree that this is a fictional series so you shouldn't really be expecting more 'down to earth' stories."
1,"Okay,not that bad.",It is an okay book. I think Cindy is a spoiled brat though.( Not as bad as Christina!!) I just wish all the books in that series were about Ashleigh & Wonder and all of Wonder's offspring. That would be cool.I mean there was only two books about Wonder racing. Come on give me a break! Just focus on Ashleigh & Wonder instead of spoiled brats like Cindy and Christina
1,"March to Glory -- THE WONDER HORSE (icky, yuck)","I don't like Glory at all. Winning the Breeder's Cup Classic by 31 lengths, pah! Why 31? If Glory's a wonder horse he should win by 40, or 50 lengths. Why not make him have wings and a turbo engine so by the time the other horses break from the gate he's already been around the track and beat them by a mile and a fourth. I'm being sarcastic. What I think the writer should have done is give Glory some competition so the reader doesn't get bored. But the best idea by far would be to have put Shining in the Classic and had her beat Glory. That would have been a twist. I would have loved it. Yah, I like that idea. These lovely horses of Cindy's in all these books are winning to much. Maybe the writers should consider not being so optimistic all the time."
1,REALISTIC?,"Yeah, abused Thoroughbreds coming from bloodlines known for producing less-than-great racehorses always turn into champions who win their first race in record-setting time. I think, in her own self-denial, Bentley has attempted to make everything perfect. I wonder, does she know we all hate her writing so much? That's anyone's guess. As for Glory, I despise him! Nothing has been done to hbave the readers bond with him or, in any other way, think of him as a over-all good horse. He just appeared out of no where and started beating top-class horses! Why should Cindy care if Samantha's entering Shining in the Classic, anyway? She knows he'll win--it's a given. Glory can't lose such an important race. If you haven't read this book, here's a suggestion for you--DON'T!"
2,"CINDY,CINDY,CINDY!!!!!!!!!","First off I hate Cindy!!!!!Thinking all the horses are Her horses .Shes a show off.Any way it was sort of good but mostly bad though. I have all 18 books so far but i like the books the best in the range 1 through 10.So if your just starting to read and the title Glory's Rival is appealing to you,don't read it yet because i tried reading it first and its ssssooooo confusing!!!Trust me!These books better GET BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... p.s. Sorry if im making this series sound bad ,there really pretty good.So i still think you should read this book and the others.Thankx again ..."
1,This IS out of hand,"First off, horses don't win maiden races of five or six furlongs by twenty lengths when they have that bad of a start. Secondly, 31 lengths? I think that speaks for itself. I think a certain author has been modeling Glory (a.k.a. The Wonder Horse) after our immortal Secretariat. That is repulsive. Too much of Glory, too much of Cindy, too much of Cindy and Glory winning. Fictional, yes. Enjoyable? Absolutely not. I'd rather read about a horse coming back from a horrible injury to win the biggest race of his life rather than, a plot line similar to ""Oh, dear, my friend wants to enter her horse in Glory's race. When Glory wins it might hurt her feelings."""
3,Not so Good!,"This book was not one of my favorites. The title glory's rival, I didn't see much of a rivaly going on maybe cindy thinking that her horse would lose to shining but not much more than that.Sometimes I thik that cindy can be such a little BRAT! she's so self centered she probly would have been so mad if Samatha entered Shining.One more thng that made thi book not one of the best was winning by 31 lenghts! i DON'T THINK SO !"
3,not the best,"why didn't sam enter shining in the classic? she would of beat glory either way. why dows cindy have to be a stuck up brat and all she wants is her horse to be the best? sam is a lot nicer than cindy and shining should of entered the classic and beat glory. glory doesn't have a rival at all, shining's faster than him any way!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
2,Not the best of spanish language films,"This movie has its moments but it's not up to the standard set by some of the Spanish and Mexican productions. (Amores Perros, Abre Los Ojos)The first thing you notice about this movie is the inferior film quality. It's not too bad, but I expected better. The plot itself is interesting up until before the end. The big ""twist"" I was expecting was somewhat of a letdown.The best parts of this movie are probably in the middle. The dance club scene manages to bring out this film's biggest strength, the chemistry between Manuel and Caro. The actress that portrays Caro is the biggest acting talent seen in this story, Ezequiel who portrays Manuel has his acting up and downs but it seems he was cast here to pull off the James Dean look which he surprisingly manages in quite a few scenes.If you happen to stumble into an opportunity to catch this movie go ahead and watch it, but don't go out of your way to get it."
2,If you are a beginner...Do not buy it,I read this book and really did not like it. It is a nightmare for any one new to compilers. It is difficult to read with more emphesis on the backend of the compiler.The following texts are much better for a beginner:1. Louden's Compiler construction --> the best text for a beginner.2. the Dragon book
1,Terrible for Starters,"This book was the textbook for an undergraduate course on compilers. Let me make it short: I never read it after reading the first chapter. The authors may be top experts on compilers but they shouldn't be writing books. Another book written in 1982 (compilers, principles, techniques and tools) saved my life for this class. If you are a beginner ""do not buy this book""."
3,Sylvania Pur Flat not as bright as hoped,Tv has a fair picture but not as bright and clear as I had hoped. DVD is easy to use and compatible with all Movies we have played. It is a good buy but not a 5 star TV by any means.
5,Farrah Ashline's Favorite,DJ Cheb Sabbah is a mastermind at blending world electronica with spirituality undertones and danceable tracks. Every CD of his is a different theme and influence. A must have CD at every dance party.Farrah Ashline
4,A good mix,"This was my first CD of this genre and I have to say that it's really good. A couple parts drag on, but for the most part it's a good CD."
3,Enjoyable and fun,"The hero and heroine of Love to Love You, Baby make this story really engaging because they're so true to life and yet just a little off-center. Each has been washed up in their career of choice and is searching for the next thing. They're frustrated, frustrating (to each other) and just plain mixed up. Spending time with them and the adorable baby who accidentally lands in the hero's lap, as well as the daffy extended cast of characters, makes for a romance of sheer escapist fun. There are some slow spots in the middle, and some events seem forced for humor rather than enhancing the story, but overall, this is a good bet for a laugh and a few hours away from your own frustrations. It's not quite as good as Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, but much better than Ms. Michaels' last effort. Give it a try."
2,Hit or Miss,"Kasey Michaels books are often hit or miss....and this one I'm sorry to say is a MISS. Why? Well, you know it's supposed to be a comedy because that's what Michaels writes. But here the comedy is forced and frantic. All the characters from Cecily to Keely to Aunt Sadie all have verbal diarrhea: they run on and on and on at the mouth. What could have been a funny little monologue ends up being a long and tedious rant that runs out of steam before it finishes.The story is meant to be a farce but the reader feels manipulated. One of the only Kasey Michaels' books I enjoyed years ago was Can't Take my Eyes Off You. That was a cute, funny and romantic book. I keep giving her a ""second chance"" but she keeps letting me down. Sorry to be so negative but if your time is limited (like mine is) and you want to read only excellent romantic comedies, choose something by authors like Jennifer Crusie, Julia Quinn or Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Your time will be better spent."
1,Rubbish,"Completely unfocused, zero romantic chemistry (when the hero and heroine got together I couldn't understand why. I reread the opening chapters of the book and it became clear that it was the heroine's endless nagging and the hero's non-personality that got them together), ditto for romantic tension, cliched, formulaic and extremely amateurish when compared with Ms. Michael's ""Then Comes Marriage,"" which was fun, had a lot of clever dialogue and great secondary characters."
3,"Almost, but not quit","The idea of this book is phenomenal, but the execution... not so much. The author acts as if we were all born in Faery and know exactly what he's talking about. The great thing about fantasy is creating a world, but Sturges forgot to explain the world to the reader. He should have used the human amongst the Fae people to explain things.One review said the book should have been longer, and I could not agree more. If you're a reader and enjoy reading, you will get through this book just fine. If you read casually, I doubt you will make it all the way through from lack of explanation.The story is great. The characters are great. The concept is great."
4,A Fey Book,"I was familiar with Sturges from his comics-related work so I knew I could expect a decent tale. While not a complete homerun it was a good, solid double. Intriguing characters, schemers behind the scenes; it's all here. The best description I've heard is ""the Dirty Dozen with elves."" I am looking forward to checking out the sequel."
1,Avoid this one,"Be warned this is a painfully bad movie. The plot is really stupid: A widower falls for some girl. The widower encourages the girl to marry his son. Everyone is happy until it turns out, that the son is gay. So the father seduces the girl. Next her crazy brother/boyfriend reappears and gets mad at everyone. Finally everyone gets mad and fights.To top it off the acting is really bad."
2,My thoughts,One major problem with this router is the lack of a 'Dead Man Switch' which could allow the motor to turn off when the switch is released. This item has a VERY cumbersome ON-OFF switch; very difficult to operate. I find it hard to imagine that anyone would make such an item with this type of switch.
3,Didn't buy it,"I was looking for a router for my router table. I looked at the DW at a tool store, and was not all that impressed. I ended up buying a Milwaukee 3.5 hp fixed base router, and could not be happier. Handling both at the same time left little choice in my mind. The Milwaukee is simply a lot better, and worth the extra $20. I've had the Milwaukee over a year, and I'm glad I bought it. It is pure quality. It is also made in the US. The DW is made in Taiwan. The difference in quality is dramitic. I must say, however, that it is light years better than a Hitachi."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was pleased with the quick shipping of this router - received it just a couple days after placing my order on Amazon.However, the first time I used the router, it worked for less than a minute, cut in and out several times and then quit working altogether.I took it to DeWalt's Factory Store/Repair Center in the Chicago area. They tell me they are ""backed up"" and it will be at least 2 weeks before they can repair the router.I have a number of other DeWalt machines (planer, compound sliding miter saw and portable table saw). This is the first one to give me any problems - hope it isn't a design flaw."
4,A BEAST of a router!!,"This is one POWERFUL router.... I can't imagine wanting any more power than this. The router will take 1/4 as well as 1/2 shank bits, and will perform really well. As far as downside, its a little heavy (as you would expect a 3 hp router), and I find it a little difficult changing bits because you have to hold the little button in to lock the spindle shaft while using a wrench to loosen the bit. The dust collection isn't all that good either (cheap plastic add ons). But if you see this one on special somewhere or really need the power, this one seems to stand up."
4,Dewalt Router,"I bought this at the recommendation of the chaps at Woodrat. I have this permanently mounted on my Woodrat with the additional plungebars. It is very smooth, with electronic soft start and is reasonably powerful. I'm not sure that it has the quality of the PorterCable 7539, but it hasn't let me down."
4,Originally designed by Swiss toolmaker ELU,"Originally designed by Swiss toolmaker ELU the DeWalt is getting a bit long in the tooth with regard to things like integral dust collection and fancy depth adjustments, but I still really like this machine. Big heavy bearings, no-nonsense controls and good ergonomics make this model my most purchased router. I had the ELU in the mid 80's but have forgotten why it went down. I bought two DW 625's in the mid 90's and have rebuilt one of them (bearings), and bought another one only a year or so ago in order to replace a notoriously ill-executed Porter Cable. So, I've seen the evolution of this design over the years and I'm happy to report that aside from minor things like the very cheesy cord strain relief, not much has changed. That's a good thing, and that's why I give it 4 1/2 stars."
5,Return to Chewelah,"A fantastic true story of young love in Seattle, a diabling accident, courage and perseverance in her struggle to regain a normal life. I met this young woman in Chewelah shortly after her accident. She came to the ski area I managed in her wheelchair looking for a job, which was near impossible to imagine. Recently I discovered her book on a flight to South America and stayed up all night to finish it. Now I have reread it twice more and have traveled to Seattle to meet her. She is an amazing woman."
4,Brutally honest Memoir,"""A Seattle woman pens a brutally honest memoir about her difficult recovery after a riding accident leaves her paralyzed, including criticisms about the rehab treatment she received"" Seattle Post-Intelligencer"
2,"The word ""kit"" is not accurate","In no way is this a bad review on the sellers part, they did great. Good packaging and the product arrived on time in great shape. What I didn't like was the fact the this ""kit"" did not include an actual latch hook tool. It is essentially a box of yarn with a pattern the reason I assumed one would be included was because of the word kit."
2,Latch Hook Nightmare!,"A previous reviewer compared it to climbing a mountain, or something like that. We saw, be bought, we climbed what we consider to be the ""nonsensical stairway to temporary insanity."" The pattern was so off, the colors so similar and not reflected on the canvas...This is not a project to undertake by the light of a fireplace. This requires FULL LIGHT to distinguish the subtle differences in color palette.The borders weren't even correct-what a mess! We had to make-up lines that we accidentally skipped-don't work w/ anyone on it, it will throw you both off! We are so glad this project is finished. 2 stars for fast delivery, detail of horse and some extra thread I could make additional design on border incorporating our last name. Still....If you don't want to be totally ""put-off"" latch hooking, then try another kit. We paid too much for this pain in the neck!"
2,Too bad it didn't age well,"I read this book because it was recommended as one I might like by Amazon. Reader, beware. This book was pretty much a waste of time, set in a rather uninteresting Cape Cod, with inadequate character development and no plot to speak of. Probably fresher when it was new."
1,Disaster,"Very dissapointing release, I is unviewable, returned the first one received, was rapidly exchanged by amazon but the second copy is also unviewable, already paid and still awaiting for a good copy. Starting it flickers the image with the Fox logo for 2 seconds and goes blank, the same thing in both copies,Guillermo Martinez"
1,Dreadful Orchestration,"The Dreadful Orchestration on this CD is simply typically pop. I remember another sophisticated Orchestra with ""Non ho l'eta"" - G Cinquetti - which was in a completely different class than this mediocre orchestra that suited her romantic voice like nothing else can! So why did they change it? Just to sound like all other pop music? Can someone PLEASE help me with the correct orchestration CD No.!Leon Maré"
2,"It's okay, still confusing","I've been to Bali 3 times and it is still hard to follow. It should have better pronounciations.I did better with the Indonesian book, rather than this one too, as everyone speaks indonesian and you don't offend someone speaking the wrong castes.Also, these books would be nicer if they had practical sentence examples rather than the ones they have on here, also, it would help to include example ANSWERS Too! :)"
2,mildly diverting,"This movie has a good enough cast, great locations and costumes but it is plagued by flashbacks, trite plot devices and excessive irony! It can't decide if is a sexy Tom Jones wanna be, a serious BBC type drama or Monty Pythonesque so it goes all over the place and ends up leaving the viewer pretty unengaged in the outcome IMO. Hotty Jason Isaacs (The State Within) is totally wasted here but he wears a great wig and is a proper villain for the brief time he is actually on screen. If you must watch it, my advice is to rent it!"
2,Too silly,"Among the few things this flick has going for it are pretty filming locales, lush costumes, warm saturated colors, and golden summer afternoon light. A romp it is, but one that provides neither enough comic relief to be sufficiently entertaining, nor (lighthearted) substance to be engaging or even remotely memorable. ""St. Ives"" is buffoonery galore. Hints of period piece parody and sprinkles of mild witticisms simply aren't enough to elevate the movie above plain silliness. It isn't an absolute bore per se but too incomplete and predictable to be valued and enjoyed."
1,Okay I guess,This movie was pretty slow moving to me. There were Some moments where it might have been funny but they tried too hard to make it funny. This movie could have been way better. So take my advice do not buy this movie if you want to see it rent it.
3,St. Ives,"This is a fair way to spend a couple of hours but not the serious movie I expected. It is whimsical and cute rather than interesting and I found myself just waiting for it to end. St. Ives is a French Cavalry officer who is challenged to duels by so many other officers in one day, that if he shows up for the duels he would miss his liaison with a lady. Instead, he chooses to insult his own commander and is reduced in rank to a private soldier in the infantry, a rank unworthy of dueling with officers, but acceptable to the lady. He is captured by the British and finds his Scotish grandfather that he has never met before, but the grandfather dies after their first meeting and his title and estate is inherited by St. Ives' drunken cousin. The cousin eventually dies and leaves St. Ives with the title and estates. Very predictable."
3,St.Ives DVD,"St. Ives is a pleasant,light hearted diversion. I'm a big fan of costume /adventure drama,with lots of duelling. This is well cast,with Anna Friel a lovely young actress I havn't seen a lot of in the past,and Richard E Grant stealing every scene,with his sly humour,and sending up his Scarlet Pimpernal image at every opportunity. Not much in the way of a serious duelling sequence to highlight the clash of the good guy/bad guy big finish,but Peter Diamond staged a couple of brief Skirmishs,and Jason Evers is always a seriously good bad guy, as anyone will know who saw "" The Patriot "". Jean Marc Barr is a likeable youg leading man,and all in all,a nice nights entertainment Garry Stewart,Melbourne,Australia."
3,not true,"It size that one size fits all. However, the top would probably only fit an anorexic 12 year old. The thigh highs look stunning on my wife but we had to bypass the teddy because of the size of it. It says that it can stretch but it does not stretch very much. If the size was different, it would be better and it would have got a better rating."
2,No removable water tank,The only reason I bought this item is because of the removable water tank. The description was wrong on the web site. It does NOT have a removable water tank; I returned the item to Amazon.
4,tub/shower repair,"This was better than I had expected. My grandson slipped and punched hole in bathtub, and I am on limited income, so to replace tub is too costly. This, while not looking professional (more me than product), is not noticable unless one looks closely. The tub is physically sound. Easy to use--though instructions could be ordered differently, and better clean-up instructions (minor complaint), and does a very good job. Recommend for even large damage. It works."
4,"Works well, but hard to match color","We used the tub/shower repair kit this weekend. We had a short but wide crack in the top of the shower that had been there since we initially installed the shower . . . hit the corner against a 2x4. Anyway, we are preparing to sell the house and wanted to fix the crack. This product worked very well to fill the crack. It smoothed out well. The only problem, is that we could not get the color to match our beige shower, no matter how hard we tried. The color mixture always ended up looking too peachy. So we went ahead and filled the crack with the peachy mixture, then covered the peachy patch with beige fiberglass shower touch-up paint. You would never know there was a crack there before!"
4,Does what is says!,This product works well- especially if you follow the instructions. Must work quickly. This is the second box -we needed to finish the job-couldn't find one at Home Depot (discontinued) but they found it on Amazon and printed out the page for me.
1,Bondo Tub & Shower Review,I tried this product twice trying to fix my shower. I had a severe crack and both times the product lifted off after a few days. This product cost me $25.00 and is not worth the price.
5,get closer to God,"This book has tought me to get more closer to God,and I have learned more about the evil ways of satan.this book also teaches you how to ask God what you have to do before you do anything, for what God knows what is best for you.It also teaches that we can't be anything with out the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, Our Savior."
4,Enjoyable book for kids,"This was pretty average for the Oz Books, I'd say. I would have liked for the Gnomes to have a little bigger part in the story if the author had to include them at all. (The hint of the Gnome's discontent with their king was promising but went nowhere.) The thing with Ozma and the Sky Man didn't really seem to work, except to get her in trouble so she couldn't pull a deux ex machina for Tiger and Friends. The Crying Singer was annoying; I was happy when he dropped out of sight.I liked the idea of the Hungry Tiger being tempted to go outside Oz for ""real tiger food."" A real tiger wouldn't have been troubled with a conscience, of course; but that's Oz for you. I loved the Vegetable Man, too. The Big Wig chapter and the Down Town chapter were enjoyable."
3,"infinitely interesting, not enough animation",i really love this sort of topic and have seen many documentaries of this ilk. being a modern science-nonfiction documentary it really should have involved some cgi animation of what we will probably look like when we evolve.
2,One big sound bite,"This presentation was just a lot of half formed, repetitive sound bites. The information is dated, the concept is dated, and frankly we have seen it all before in the movies. There was nothing concrete or usable. When it really got boring they would throw in a celebrity or two as Colin Powell or William Shatner to spice it up a tad. I know this presentation is really an attempted biography but still falls short of its purpose.Basically it went from the possibility of improving man then machine then eventually building the ultimate man/machine as in the film ""Over Sexed Rugsuckers from Mars"" (1989).I did like looking at the old-time computers and bygone personalities."
1,A Legend in His Own Mind,"This is a film about a clever man who looks in the mirror and believes he sees God. As God, he is of course able to answer all the great philosophical questions. What is death? (a whole bunch of sad empty rooms). What is consciousness? (something that machines will acquire in 25 years). But God, as usual, appears to need money and so he travels around the country shaving his tired old face in dreary hotel rooms and dragging his rickety carcass to any gathering of people willing to pay his speaking fees. This is a boring film about a third-rate blowhard. Skip it."
5,Exciting,The DVD is a little commercial but a very good introduction to the topic.Anyone can understand and it's just exciting to watch. A must have!I bought 8 to give to close friends.
5,Ray Kurzweil - Transformative man,"Since receiving this DVD (one of the BEST documentaries ever), I have watched it at least 10 times. I have gifted it to others frequently, and they report being Transcendently Transformed by it. Having been called the rightful heir to Thomas Edison, as well as the intellectual heir to both Einstein and Darwin, this amazing man is at the top of my list of personal heroes. He gives new meaning to the word ""Promise""!"
2,Machines Will Rule The World,"Mr. Kurzwell makes some good points but maybe, just maybe, if machines do become smarter than humans, humans will pull the plug!"
2,I didn't learn much,Felt like a puff piece half-covering Kurzweil's life. It didn't work as a biographical documentary or as an examination of his beliefs.
5,Great -- a real visionary,"Love all of Ray Kurzweil's books and movies. This man is a modern prophet and visionary. Some of his ideas are a little radical, but his past predictions have come true. His point is the exponential growth factor."
3,Interesting but disturbing documentary...,"This is an interesting documentary. However, I found this movie disturbing because this guy is so so arrogant! And he seems completely oblivious to his own over-intellectualization of grief about his relationship with his father. Jeez. Or to the impact of war, disease, revolutions, asteroids, etc. Somehow this movie seems indicative of the gestalt at Google, sort of 21st century version of the arrogance of the Tower of Babel. Watch if you want to see exactly where some of these techies heads are at....we'll check back when this guy realizes we all die---even smart people who take 200 pills a day to ""modify their Body's chemistry""."
1,Don't expect it to last,"I've had this cover less than a year, and I'm already looking for a replacement. The drawstring broke after only a few months. I could still make it work by tying the ends of the string together. But, sometime over the winter, the cover ripped in several places. It was very thin material, and it just didn't hold up. Next time, I'm going to invest more in a heavy-duty cover."
1,Not Durable at all,"Bought this item in fall and did not last me more than a couple rainy days and a few windy days.1) The picture and size are misleading, it covers only half of the bottom2) The laces do not work to tighten the cover and with a little bit of rain the cover ripped right from the lace grooves.Spend the few extra bucks and buy the stronger plastic covers."
5,Fits like a glove,Perfect! the elastic band keeps the bag in place in spite of the wind and the material is really good!
2,Very flimsy - you get what you pay for!,"It covers my grilll but the material it is made from is very thin. It didn't last too long, and was torn for the wind within a few days. Now I will have to buy another one. The only good thing about this grill cover was that it was very cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Price is great, but very thin","If you purchase this product, just be careful taking it off and on. The material rips very easily. Price is great though."
1,"Complete junk, inferior. Waste of money","I have now gone through two of these covers. The very first one I bought from Char-Broil ripped the first time I tried to put it on. Char-Broil replaced it, though I asked for a credit of what I spent for it towards a higher quality one because I knew what was going to happen. Well, I got through the summer and fall with it and it now resides in my garbage dumpster awaiting the garbage man tomorrow. It was torn to shreds. It is where it belongs, in the garbage."
3,It made the trick...,"It kept my grill covered during the Bostonian winter. It is a low quality product but you can't ask for more based on what you are paying. Not durable, not great."
2,"Long title, long movie!","The first part of the movie is really enjoyable, Penelope Cruz as beautiful as ever, but by the time that the parts of the young lovers are taken over by the mature actors, these characters become not so likable, she for being so selfish and manipulative and him for being such a sap.And I can not see how Penelope could ""grow"" to look like the other actress, I found her features rather unatractive, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and Penelope's is hard to match.If you are not fluent in Spanish, beware, the titles are very small and white, very difficult to read, at times impossible.For Penelope's fans, but remember, she is only in half the movie!"
4,Uneven but interesting,"This movie has a great soundtrack, and follows an interesting progression from the Spain of the 1960s to the present. There are a number of scenes in which historical figures or events form an inconsequential backdrop to the storyline. The movie is supposed to be a decades-long love story between two people from very different backgrounds that never end up together, but at times it seems more like the story of an ambitious and not-too-likable woman. This is born out in the ending which portrays more of her ambition rather than a romantically satisfying conclusion. There is also an odd transition from younger actors to older actors that do a good job but don't necessarily seem like they look quite right as older versions of the same people. If you are interested in a Penelope Cruz movie, there are better choices. She appears as the younger version of the main character for less than half of the film and isn't very likable."
2,Insufficient information in description,I was left in quite an expensive bind when i found that i had purchased the incorrect edition of this book. A detailed description with emphasis on which edition it is would have been appreciated.
4,Great Linzer Tarts,"Really varied cookbook -- has really good creative ""lists"" of things such as impromptu appetizers and sandwich fillings throughout the book's chapters. Have made the Miniatrue Viennese Linzer tarts many times -- always a big hit with friends and family!!"
5,One of my mom's favorite cookbooks,My mom owns a catering business and she has used these recipes for years. I saw that her version was in taters and she said that she hadn't been able to find a replacement in any stores. Well Amazon had it. I got it for her birthday and she loves it. The carrot cake is amazing.
5,The best cookbook!!!!,"I have spent time working as a chef all over the world and this is my favorite cookbook of all time! The recipes are precise and easy to follow, yet still extremely creative. So far I haven't made anything from here that hasn't been fantastic. I always end up giving this as a present and I am very sad to hear it is going out of print. I'll have to try to buy as many as I can, because my copy is starting to fall apart. The last recipe I made was the Grand Marnier Chocolate Mousse Cake, and it was great!!!! However, we all were getting drunk from eating it!"
5,Frog Commissary Cookbook,"Frog Commissary Cookbook How I even got the book is a story itself! My girlfriend, who I've known since kindergarten, told me about a recipe in the book. She said she would copy it for me since the book was out of print, and her copy was literally falling apart, and in pages. I went to Amazon and found the book at a very reasonable price!! So I ordered two, one for me and one for her. The recipes I have tried are EXCELLENT! The Carrott cake, the Chocolate Mouse Cake and a chicken dish that was wonderful! I am ordering another book for another friend who was very impressed with the recipes! Thanks AMazon! Cathy Bubeck"
5,Tattered and loved...,"I purchased this book back in 1985 when it was first published. If the number of folded pages, splatters on recipes and notations of ""excellent!"" mean anything... then this is by far one of my favorite cookbooks of all time!These recipes are just as good today as they were back then.Some of my favorite recipes: Taramasalata, Caponata, Bourbon Pecans, Vegetarian Chili, Goat Cheese Pizza, Potato-Rutabaga Gratin, Pasta and Smoked Mozzarella Salad with Roasted Peppers, Spinach, and Creamy Parmesan Dressing, Coffee Walnut Chocolate Chip MuffinsGet the book and start cooking for rave reviews from friends and family!"
5,"yes, this is really the BEST cookbook ever","When we lived in Philly, Frog, the Commisary, and Eden were definitely on our top 10 list. The recipes in this book bring that back for us every time. These recipes cannot be beat. My friends have been BEGGING for the recipes for years: eggplant capponata, carrot cake, chocolate killer cake-just to name a few. I am so glad to see this in print again so that we don't have to be tempted to photocopy."
5,Cleverly written and illustrated with inventive recipes,"I've been using this cookbook for the last 10 years and it is my very favorite of all my cookbooks, it's cleverly written and illustrated and the recipes are inventive and easy to follow. I like to experiment a lot with food and this book has a lot of fun ideas. I was so happy to discover that I can still purchase this book because mine is falling apart from so much use ."
4,Powerfully accurate,"I purchased this with full intent of putting it in, through, and around almost every material imaginable. It powered through my drywall installations with ease, and accuracy ( my keyhole saw hasn't been very dusty lately). But hold on to it, because it can get away from you. Yet, needless to say I would rather have this ""issue"" than having it be underpowered.This tool has great balance, bit changes sans tool(s) is very convenient and one less thing for me to lose on the job. The depth gauge adjustment is easy to get to and simple. The bump off switch is a nice, it didn't seem like an overly important detail at the time of purchase, but the time you fire it up, do your business, and shut it down, its a very handy.The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have yet to put any cement backers, or tile under it. I really feel that if I run into any problems it will be with the bits and not the machine.Its made my life, and my work more efficient and better."
3,"Powerful, but cheaply made","Had this for a couple of years now. I really like this tool for it's power and versatility. So far I've used it to cut drywall, cut out squares and rectangles in thin wood, cut metal with the proper bits or abrasive wheel bits, etc.My gripes, are the no tool lock system of theirs. The cheap plastic piece that says # 2 on it broke off and is not fixable, so basically, I just use a wrench to tighten it down now. Also, this tool gets hot. Especially when I'm using bits with the abrasive cutters on the ends. Maybe that's not it's proper function, but regardless, it get's pretty hot.Besides that, I really like it's power and versatility."
3,Dewalt rotary tool,"The rotary tool itself works great, however it came with a drill bit instead of a rotary bit. Had I known this, I would have bought a rotary bit at the same time I bought this tool. My project was delayed because I had to purchase the correct bit after the fact!"
4,Been using it on light projects and,it's good for around the house and may have some industrial uses but I wouldn't recommend for on jobsites since it's enclosure isn't ruggedized for that kind of environment. (Plastic seems a bit too thin/brittle) Other than that- works great!
3,Buy a RotoZip,"Good tool but bulky and over powered. I bought mine when only the tool was avialible. If I bought it today I'd buy the kit, but would definitely consider the RotoZip Kit as well it's $20 more but it's made by Bosch."
4,Hein,"beautiful CD with some excellent songs from Hein, it makes clear he found a new career after his period as childstar."
1,Al Shirk Strikes Again,"Al Shirk (he changed his surname to his wife's, Lindemann, back in the glory days of sensitive feminism) is a socialist historian of European socialism, who has been trying to indoctrinate students at UC Santa Barbara for more than 30 years. In my experience with him as a graduate student, he viewed everything through a filter that ignored contrary evidence and accepted only information that placed socialism in a good light. Clever, he was not profound. In seminar, getting him to agree with silly, but pro-socialist, propositions was a sport. Several Jewish graduate students described him then as a self-hating Jew. This book seems consistent with his ideological bent."
1,Hateful Antisemitic Sewage,"One of the most bizarre antisemitic rants since 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' I've seen Jews blamed for a lot of things, but blaming Jews for antisemitism gets into a whole new level of psychopathic delusion -- either that, or plain, stone-hearted malice. Much of the material in this festering boil of a book, especially the conclusion, would have left Joseph Goebbels nodding in admiration. Cambridge University Press has utterly disgraced itself by publishing this vicious tripe."
4,Good solution for cluttered freezer.,I purchased two of these for my freezer. They help wrangle the bags of frozen veggies and such. It is much nicer with an organized freezer. I can pull out the bin with what I need and not have an avalanche.
3,Great Things in a bad box,"I love reading these books to my grand children. However, the box is not worthy of the books and what not it holds."
2,Fantastic books. Horrible case.,"This was not the chest/case we saw in the initial promotion for the collection. We were very disappointed when it arrived. I was expecting a faux leather or faux wood, but cardboard and plastic? It doesn't even look good from across the room, let alone the 5 feet away that some suggest."
4,Nothing special about this Box Set,"I had read all of the Harry Potter books borrowing them from friends because I wanted to wait until the series was complete, so I could buy the inevitable box set. I have no complaints about the books themselves. They are the nice hardback volumes I expected. Of course, the books themselves are also a wonderful collection of stories that I highly recommend to anyone who likes magical tales. My complaint is with the box itself. It is made of cardboard and plastic. It will take quite a bit of care to keep it looking nice for any length of time. If this is purchased for any but the most fastidious child to keep in his/her room, I would expect the box to be in tatters within a few months. I suppose that for the price I shouldn't have expected more, but I am not sure it there is any point to buying the box set other than its value as a collectible item."
2,Disappointed,"I was totally disappointed in this set. When I pre-ordered back in July the product description stated that the set would come in a decorative wooden box. That was one of the reasons I ordered it. Imagine my surprise when my set finally arrived and the ""decorative wooden box"" turned out to be tacky cardboard and plastic. False advertising I would say.If I had not waited so long (the promise date was originally at the end of August and was extended to October)for this book set I would return with out a second thought. I probably will think twice before I order anything from Amazon again. Pretty sad really as I have ordered many books over the years from you and have never been disappointed. Your customer quality control is slipping.Kathryn Roman - Very upset customer"
2,Expectation Fall Short,"Mind you, I have never read a single HP book, but since most of my friends give rave reviews and comment, together seeing a good boxset is sold on amazon.com, I was thinking, ""let me give it a try.""Well, I give it a 5-star rating for getting all 7 books. Each book costs only about $17. It is indeed a good deal.But... the cardboard... I'm sorry, but I believe the publisher has already made enough money off from the HP's readers, can't they sell something decent instead of putting everything in a cardboard box? such a shortfall of high expectation. Unless publisher stated ahead of time about the cheap material of the trunk, then I guess there shouldnt be any complains from us.So, it's a 5-star for the price for the books, but a nil-star rating for the deceptive marketing trick. All in all, what you pay is really what you get :)"
2,So very disappointed!!,"I was really excited about this set as I had books 1-6 in paperback and wanted to have the whole set in hardcover. True, this set did wind up cheaper than buying the books seperately, but I am still VERY disappointed. I was not expecting some magestic hardwood trunk, but at the very least I expected sturdy cardboard or paperboard, well covered with some form of covering to make it LOOK like a trunk. The corners of this ""trunk"" look like your average file box, and they are already tearing. All I've done is take the plastic off the books! Seriously, people who have purchased this set deserve an apology, and a sturdy replacement box, free of charge. Just buy the books by themselves, build your own box, (or put all your books in a file box and let a 5 year old ""decorate"" it for you and you'll have something compareable to this set.)"
2,That ain't wood..,"The books are fine, but you'd expect a wooden case, the box is actually cheap cardboard, and not very good cardboard at that!"
3,Once in a While,"It doesn't matter if you're eight or eighty (or anywhere in between), a trip to whimsey with Harry Potter won't hurt a bit - may, in fact, put a smile where there is all too often a line of concern with just the struggle of living from day to day. That being said, sometimes we all need a break from our usual reading choices to either appreciate them more or to adjust them for the better. There's a lot of reading material out there that's best described as needing some serious effort at improvement in order to be classed as junk. But, there's also a lot of literature, too. I think at the very least, the Harry Potter series may open a few minds to venture into the classics. Wouldn't that be a treat?Jack"
5,For the serious Harry Potter collector,"This is an excellent collector's edition at an exceptional price!!! (I got it at $115.00)While it may be hard to find the first editions; this is a wonderful way to have all 7 books, in the same format and protected in a custom size box to help protect from shelf damage, mold, mildew, etc.A perfect gift to put aside for your children, or yourself, that is sure to appreciate in value in the years to come.Now, I just have to get J.K. Rowling to autograph them and I'll be all set."
1,"Alice Willowbrook, IL",I am very disappointed also thought the trunk was wood and sturdy I believe they should send a different truck to all people who fell for this and bought these boxsets.
1,poorly done cardboard,This is such a sad excuse for a collector's chest. In fact a cardboard box with visibly ugly edges. When I first read the description it was written as a wooden box which is why I ordered it and figured I was getting a great deal for pre-ordering. Not the case. I would have been more than happy to pay more for a nicely done box even if it were just a sturdier cardboard made well that looked better. The box looks great if you neglect the corners all together and don't plan on using the handles at all. It should have been covered with some sort of edging and made a bit better. I was pretty sad to get such a disappointing product. I am still excited however to read the books.
3,okey-dokey,"glad it is new could have saved money buying used, was not pleased with the box. thought it might be an inexpensive wood photo finish, but came in cardboard. can save $30.00 buy without the box."
3,"Good books, bad shipping and ""chest""",The picture is misleading... It looks like a sturdy box with metal corners and such. All of it is a printed mess on laminated plastic-cardboard like material. Excellent books inside mind you - just crappy presentation and packaging. The imagery of the product are there to mislead you into thinking that a quality chest was created in order to store your books. Obviously the prototype was used and may have been made out of a decent material.The actual shipment of the object wasn't given much thought. The corners were crushed rather nicely - further detracting from the display.
1,Got Cardboard?,"I wish I had known that flimsy cardboard could be photographed so handsomely. I wish I had known that a cheap carboard box, not even as durable as the shipping box, was costing me thirty bucks. I wish I had known what a sucker I could be, and that when after my initial enthusiasm and subsequent reading of other disappointed consumers, that in just 5 minutes after realizing I had probably ordered a disappointment, Amazon already had it ""scheduled to be shipped"" and so the order could not be cancelled (within 5 minutes!!!??? Wow! Talk about efficient!!), but could be returned at my inconvenience.I love the HP collection, and had it hit and miss, so I do like having all 7 volumes in a set. But I could make a better box. Hey! You want a real treasure chest for Harry Potter? I can make it happen a lot better than this rip off."
4,Inventive packaging for a boxed set,"This is a great boxed set of the Harry Potter books. I had really hoped that the ""trunk"" would be made out of something more substantive than just cardboard, but after consideration, I'd rather have a cardboard trunk with stickers than just a boring cardboard box with a logo on it.It's a great way to keep all of my Harry Potter volumes together and it looks interesting on the bookshelf!"
3,Only mildly disappointed,"Okay. I was probably expecting too much. After all, we are talking about a set that includes 7 hardcover books for a little over $100. However, the pictures on the web site made the ""trunk"" look way more substantial than it really is. This case is not worth more than a couple of bucks. So, if you can get the books individually for less, I would."
2,Fantastic Books! Who came up with the packaging?!?,"The chest was a really great idea; but thank God Amazon had the set for cheaper than retail. I would have truly been irritated if I'd paid anything more than what the books could be purchased for individually. The chest is really cute, but not very good quality. Had a FANTASTIC time reading all the books though. I am 35 years old, work a ""full-time"" job, and still managed to read all 7 books in 3 weeks. I had to! I have 4 nephews and a niece who were bound to let the ending slip. Super stories, sad to see the end."
5,Great product at a great price,Super fast shipping during the holiday season brought this product into our home. The item was in perfect condition upon arrival and was just as described.Would purchase from this seller again! Very happy customer :)
3,Potter collection,"This was one of the best gifts I have ever received. I actually think I enjoyed the books more than the movies but wish I got the kindle editions instead. I think it is a good start and if you become a fan because you like the books, you can look for hardcovers and other packages especially for fans and collectors. I think this package is good, specifically for those people that just want to start reading this popular set that is everywhere without being a fan. The price is excellent and although the box is made of cardboard and a little fragile but if you keep it in one place then it will last fine."
5,Best Birthday Present EVER!,This is exactly what my 10 year old grandson wanted. He just finished reading my copies and wanted a set of his own. His 8 year old brother is reading them also! We love these books.
5,good stuff,"This item arrived sooner than i thought, and it was in great shape. The reciever loved the christmas gift."
1,Misleading information,"I drank an entire bottle of windex as I suspected it was polyjuice potion and I really wanted to turn into that dude from diners dine ins and dives, but now my vision is tinted permanently blue. Thanks a lot harry potter..."
2,anyone else?,"I have to agree with everyone else about the cheap box. Very disappointing. But I have a different question. Did everyone's books fit tightly in the box? Mine were squeezed in very tight, because I had an extra book 2! 8 books came with mine. I'm just wondering, if everyone's fit that tightly with only 7 books, should I go through every book searching for missing pages? Thanks,"
5,AN EXCELLENT ITEM FOR HARRY POTTER FANS,The quality of this box set is good. I had prefered a wooden box because if you don't know the box that you can see on the photos is carton. But it's Ok. If you love HP you'll love it.
5,Beautiful set,"Of course the hardback books are enough to be a collector's item, but the fun ""trunk"" these come in is an awesome bonus (and protects your books). You can decorate it yourself! Call me a kid again."
4,Nice gift idea. Paid $50,"My wife wanted this. I dont like soft cover, but she asked specifically for it, for ease of use/on-the-go. Nice little set."
4,Wow!,"Just got the set today and it looks wonderful. Yes, the box itself is pretty flimsy but I dont have any issues with it nor the weird plastic lock. I highly doubt it will stand the test of time over the years of being moved around but the books themselves came in perfect condition without a crinkle or crease in the covers. Glad I picked this up for the family."
3,nice teenagers' edition,"the text is the original, it s just that the cover and the page layout refers mostly to teenagers and not to adults. Nice value for money though."
5,one of the best book series out there,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)i bought this set about a month and a half ago and i loved it i have read it 6 times already since i bought it. granted i have read them before but now i can read them anytime i want because i own them lol. i feel J.K. Rowling is one of the best authors out i feel she compares with Stephen King and Stephine Meyer and James Patterson some of my all time favorite writers i am hoping now that she finished the harry potter series that maybe she will go on to write other things of that sort but if she does i will defiantly go out and by it.
1,It is a CARDBOARD BOX!,"We pre-ordered this as soon as it was available. I give the low rating to the Package or boxset. The books are all hardbacks like the ones previously available and are finely made. The chest is a cardbaord box with a junky plastic clasp that is really hard to close, and heavy string for handles.We had higher expectations than just a colored cardbaord box. We expected a CHEST! Not a cardboard box, but a CHEST, a TRUNK, a FOOTLOCKER, or SOMETHING! The box is only slightly nicer than the brown one it came in. I feel ripped off. We are thinking about returning it. There must be a better ""Box Set"".I would get this for the fine books and throw the box (or chest as they call it) away."
5,Great Books,"I thought that it is a very nice set. However, I also have waited until this last book, before purchasing the set as hardback. The books are beautiful; and THE BOX IS JUST OKAY. If you had to purchase the books separately (new); you would pay just as much (or more). THE BOX COULD HAVE BEEN NICER, but it is fine for the price. It would have cost much more, if it was made of wood. All in all, it is a nice COMPLETE set of hardback Harry Potter books. I like the set, however if I already owned the set of hardback books; I wouldn't have bought this set too. It is a nice way to store & protect the set; and would make a wonderful gift for a young Harry Potter fan.2/22/2008 Again, I need to emphasize that I would not have bought this set FOR THE BOX. IF you are buying it for THE BOX, you might be disappointed; more likely. I bought this set for the BOOKS that it contained; and am VERY pleased with the set."
4,Where's the box,"What is there to say, it's Harry Potter books 1-7. The only bad thing about it is the box is flimsy card board. I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend and she loved it. She has not opened the plastic on the books yet. I think she is going to keep it intact."
4,Harry Potter Boxed Set,"I was very pleased with this set. My boys love Harry Potter and now they have all seven hardcover books in one case to keep for later. The case is nice, cardboard, but sturdy, for storage of the books."
5,VERY GOOD,The books I purchased are very good and they were mailed to us on Christmas Day. The service of Amazon is amazing! Thanks a lot.
3,Box is CHEAP,"The ""Box"" this comes in is SAD to say the least. I was expecting a cheap pine box or something. This is in a cardboard box covered with paper with a black plastic latch. Very disappointed in the quality. I'm almost embarrassed to give it to my daughter."
5,Harry Potter Audio CDs years 1 through 7,I full enjoyed each and every book. It was a really pleasant experience which kept me engrossed. Harry Potter is a timeless joy.
5,Harry Potter box set (paperback),"Just loved the books! I thought they would have less quality for they're paperback and cheap, but I was mistaken! Really good ones, strongly recommend them, good deal!"
5,Christmas Gift,The gift I purchased for my daughter for Christmas arrived on time and was very well liked. I look forward to future purchases.
3,Not very attractive Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7),"I was disappointed with the delivered books. They WERE the books I requested, but I expected more of the ""boxed set."" The box was a dishevelled, secondhand box like from the grocery store, not a box specifically designed for books. I've ordered secondhand books from Amazon before and they were in much better condition. Much better. The condition of the books themselves is fair at best. The covers were battered. Previous orders of secondhand books were in much better shape. But my granddaughter was interested in the words, and they were all there. Thank goodness she wasn't disappointed....like me. I'd rate the shipment barely okay."
5,Harry potter box set,So cool that it comes in a trunk like case loved the books and movies so happy to have the complete set
2,Shipping Inadequate,This collector's item was shipped without any packaging and the collector's box was ruined from rough handling during shipping. I was forced to return this item.
2,"Poor, thoughtless packaging mars the beauty of these books!","Though I had this item on my wish list here at Amazon for the longest time, I decided to be patient and wait for it to be in the local bookstores before purchasing it. It was worth my patience, as the packaging for this so-called Collector's Boxset of Harry Potter books, years 1-7 is really rubbish! The trunk that houses the books is made of thick cardboard that does not seem sturdy enough, and the worst feature in my opinion is the cheap plastic clasp that locks the trunk!There are so many other ways this packaging could have been made better...and I'm sure if the manufacturer's has upped the quality factor, consumers would have been prepared to shell out more money for a quality wooden box, instead of something cheap-looking and flimsy that is not even worth being hyped as a collector's set. Very disappointing indeed."
1,Flimsy cardboard box a dissapointment,"Like the many other reviewers, I eagerly awaited this special set, only to be disappointed by the flimsy cheap looking box. I do NOT recommend anyone ordering this product. The hardbound books are great, but the box is a dud."
1,RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!,Very very sad... Love the wonderful books but can't believe what a lame excuse for a display chest they used. Cheap cardboard... very tacky...
3,Harry Potter Book Set,"My son is enjoying the Harry Potter series for the first time, but when he got to book five it is missing half of chapter 30 and all of chapter 31. Other chapters are repeated in the book! The poor quality of the bindings were to be expected given the price but I did not expect to be missing pages."
5,Fantastic! A Must Read.,"These set of books were a great purchase. The stories are filled with humour, suspense and lots of action. The characters develop nicely in this series.I could not put it down. Even my twelve year old son read through them once and is going on a second round of reading! The price is fine for a set of seven, paperback books."
3,You get what you pay for,"Do I wish this was a wooden trunk with gold-plated hardware and a leather interior? Sure I do! Did I think that for one minute seeing the price (which averages out to about $17 per HARDBACK BOOK) that I would be getting a wooden trunk? HECK NO! Gimme a break. Sure, it's a cheap cardboard container (with a few nicely printed stickers thrown in as a bonus) and I would have loved something better, but anyone who expected what some of these reviewers are writing obviously don't shop very much! So I give it a 5 star on the nice hardback editions and probably a 1 or 2 on the quality of the boxed set...but again, it's about what I expected."
2,Only because it was discounted,"The only reason I'm keeping this is because I refused to purchase the books on my own until a collector's edition came out [can you imagine the wait!], and it seems to be cheaper to buy the set than to buy each separately.However there is no excuse for the packaging. It upsets me so much I consider sending it back. Cheap cardboard, cheap box. McDonald's packages their Big Macs better than this."
3,Not worth the price.,"Okay, I actually work in a bookstore, so I knew what these were before they were shipped out. However, I had already placed the order here since they were actually cheaper than what my store was selling them for. When I placed the order, the description DID actually say the books were coming in a WOODEN BOX which was mostly why I reserved a set. Of course, I also wanted a complete set of the hard back books all together. But as I've read in other reviews, it is VERY disappointing (and cheap on the publishers' side) to give CARDBOARD boxes like this! So, if you want the whole set of HP books in hard back, I'd suggest just buying them seperatly. It's probably cheaper and you won't have to look at a rather crummy looking cardboard chest."
1,Harry Potter Boxed Set,"I am very disappointed with the cheap cardboard box. For some reaon I expected a little more quality. I question how durable this boxed set will be. Had I understood how tacky the box would be, it would not have been purchased."
2,Poor Collectible,"First off the Harry Potter books are great and is the reason this gets 2 stars, I'd give it 5 stars but this isn't just about the books. The box is just a cheap plain and simple painted cardboard box."
4,US version - you get what you pay for,Translated into US-English as the American publisher is scared US children won't understand such a vastly different culture. Very cheap but low quality paperbacks. You get what you pay for.
2,dude i was duped,"i ordered the ""incredible"" set (incredible being used quite loosely) for my birthday and expecpted a wooden box with all seven hard cover books. The books came and i even got stickers but the thing is this isnt what i ordered. they did say wooden and man i remember reading something about it is comingwith a key as well which i am not making up because someone else told me they remembered reading that as well. is this false representation? yes. if i wanted the books i saw a set for 50 bucks but of course it didnt come with the box, which might i say is probably made out of the material they make packing peanuts out of. ive used toothpicks sturdier than this and i am dissapointed but the books are the important part. but id just like to say thanks amazon for the plastic hatch and toothpick dispenser"
4,Potter Series,The books arrived very quickly and at a reasonable price.There were a few pages that had ink smears making some of the text difficult to read but this was from the printer.
1,Not Worth It,I've wanted these book for myself for sometime now. I went into a book store and saw this at a distance. I thought it was more than just cardboard. For the price of $195.00 or the price here at Amazon I just bought the books separate. I would have spent 200.00 if the container the books came in were like a real chest but no way!I got the books on Amazon separately and it was still cheaper to do it this way. I could have got them even cheaper if I bought paperback but seeing them displayed at the bookstore turned me off because they hadn't even left the store and they were destroyed. So I went with hardcover.
3,trunk = marketing ploy,"It's nice to get all the books (hardcover) at one go. This makes an especially nice gift for the young aspiring reader.But do *not* buy this set for the box -- except possibly as ""wrapping"" for the initial giving. As previous reviewers have pointed out, the container is just a folded cardboard box with stickers on it. The pictures can be a bit deceiving: the dark color makes it look like you are getting something more than just cardboard. But you're not."
3,Its okay,"If you are not a crazy harry potter fan, then this collection is fine. And you get what u pay for"
5,Great!,"This product looked great and I got it for a very reasonable price, it shipped quickly and undamaged and was a hit this Christmas!"
5,HARRY POTTER BOOK'S I LOVE THEM,"I HAVE READ ALL THE HARRY POTTER BOOK'S AND LOVE ALL OF THEM I HAVE THEM ON CD I ALSO PLAY THE PS2 GAMES I AM A BIG FAN OF HARRY POTTY. I AM 71 YEARS OLD. I READ THESE BOOK'S TO MY GRANDSON ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE A LOTE OF FUN PLAYING THE GAMES.HE HAS HIS OWN SET OF BOOK'S AS WELL.4 YEARS AGO I DID NOT HAVE A AMAZONKINDLE SO I DID NOT GET MY HARRY POTTER BOOKS THrough AMAZON BUT NOW I GET ALL MY BOOKS THROUGH ANMAZON>BECOUSE I HAVE READ THE HARRY POTTER BOOK'S I THEN STARTED TO READ OTHER BOOK.S I HAVE READ ALL THE TWILIGHT BOOK'S, ALL THE TERRY GOODKIND BOOK'S, ALL OF CHRISTOPHER PAOLINI BOOK'S AND AM UP TO BOOK 5 OF ROBERT JORDAN.I LOVE ALL THESE WRITERS"
3,Great Item for Fans,Is just as the description says it came on a nice box seal and the person who receive it was very fascinated by it !!!!!
5,Great!,These books are amazing. They were all in very great condition and were great reads. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good story!
3,Missing book,"The box set came wrapped in plastic but missing book 3. I returned it, and Amazon replaced it with a complete set. Odd QA issue resulted in inconvenience."
5,Great value!! But.....,"This is a great item set at an amazing price! The box it comes in is fantastic!! My only criticism is that it comes with the first book titled as ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and not ""The Philosopher's Stone"" as J.K. intended. Seems insulting to the American audience but hey, what can you do? It's a small price to pay for this amazing series."
5,Love It!!!,"I love Harry Potter!! J. K. Rowling did such a great job. When I was done with them I didn't know what to read next, for Christmas I got the box set and now I'm on book four!!! Great books!!"
3,"Bad package, good content!","I have to agree with majority of other reviewers. The 'treasure chest' is anything other than that. The clasp that holds the chest lid to the bottom, broke on the first attempt to open by my child. The box itself looks good, but the material is anything to be proud of.Just like you see in the pictures, it 'looks good', 'nuf said!!No comments on the books themselves."
2,Harry Potter books,Ordered and recieved 1 then a couple of days later 2 and then 3 and had to send them off for my Grandaughter without the last 2 books for Christmas. WAS NOT HAPPY about that. also some of the books did not have the covers on them. Not happy at all. Really upset she didn't get her Christmas present all together for that special day since I can't be there with them.
5,Fantastic,Nice collection of the seven Harry Potter books. This makes for a perfect gift for any child interested the stories... lots of pages = lots of reading!
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I initially only wanted the hardcover versions, but they were much more expensive. Since this one comes in a nice box that keeps them from excess shelf wear/dust and was a far more affordable, it's the best version I could have. Thank you!"
5,Harry Potter 1- 7 Audio Collection,"Harry Potter 1- 7 Audio CollectionJim Dale brings the many characters in Harry Potter to life in an amazingly believable way. I thoroughly enjoyed the books and movies, but the audio collection is for me the most enjoyable way to enjoy the series."
2,I'm joining the club,"Just like every other reviewer I was disappointed with the cardboard ""Pirates Chest"". I bought the set as a gift and now I'm embarrassed by the packaging. Still, the price isn't bad for the entire set of books."
2,Hornswoggled,"This isn't about the books - it is about the so-called chest. It is horrible. Flim-flam at its worst! UPDATE: I recognize that many comments are directed at the overall cost of the books (about $17 each), then that is what the marketing and advertising plan should have addressed, but they didn't they marketed the chest. Besides most of us already own the books in hardback; some of us were thinking of future generations to enjoy these fun books - so I still say the consumer was bamboozled! Where was Ralph Nader and Consumer Reports when you need them."
1,False Advertising,"I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but I had to after receiving my Harry Potter ""Box"" set. I put box in quotes because it's not a box at all but cheap cardboard! What a ripoff! The picture clearly intends to portray it as a wooden box. It appears that either Amazon or Scholastic made an effort to conceal the fact that it wasn't wooden at all. I'm sure everyone purchased this item to receive the nice wooden crate, well don't waste your time! I have no complaint about the books, they're great. The false advertising in this picture is disgusting though!"
1,MISSING!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read the AMAZING Harry Potter books before, but I wanted my own copies, so I got this set. I decided to use the 4th book for a project for school, and got mostly done, all the way to page 466, and then it skips 59 pages! It goes straight to 515! I decided to just keep reading, and then, when I got to page 562, it goes back to 515!!!! Also, I read in many reviews that it came with a top, lock, bookends AND handles. I did not get any of those.I am very disappointed and wish that I could read some of my favorite books"
1,New does NOT include all items!!,"I am upset with the designation as 'new' for the condition of this special boxed set with bookends. The reason it is special is because it comes with the special box and bookends!! I am glad I read the fine print before I ordered and realized these third party sellers were not selling the advertised product!! Buyers beware. Confirm exactly what you are getting before you buy. I will keep looking or just buy cheap used paperback copies. Sellers, please only advertise what you are actually selling- your sets should NOT come up under this description.blessings,"
3,A Great Disappointment,"Regardless the fact that the price for the 7 books alone is worth the purchase, I was nevertheless unsatisfied. I purchased this collection a while back for my gf as a gift for her bday that is coming up soon. I am quite unwilling and discouraged to tell her that now she has two sets of Harry Potter books and a cardboard box."
1,Supremely disappointed......,"I've been a major fan of the HP series for many years, and never acquired any of the books in hopes that they would release all of the hardcovers in a set. When I saw back in July that this set was being released I was thrilled. I just received it today, and have already filled out the return form to Amazon. I am HIGHLY disappointed. I am in the Graphics industry, and we would NEVER package something as precious as the novels themselves in something as shoddy as this faux woodgrain file box. Maybe if the publisher receives enough of these back (at $120 each), they'll get the hint. Just watch, six months from now they'll produce a REAL wooden box.... Avoid this!!!"
2,Jared,"While the books themselves are fine the collectors case and ""lock"" they describe are cheaply made, and, as everyone else mentions, made of cardboard. For a collectors item I was expecting a little bit more; it's definitely a disappointment."
2,Too much money for the fake wooden box!,"I paid $113 for this set of books expecting a wooden box with it. HaHa! It is a cardboard box made to look like wood, one of the strings on the side is broken, and the catch on the front that you close and open it with is about a 2-minute break for a child that is not very careful about opening. I am totally disappointed with it for that much money. The books inside the box are fine, however. Lynelle Godfrey, Florence, SC"
3,Love the books...,"... but hate the fact that I had to go thru Pottermore to get them. When the books first came out, Rowling seemed to think Amazon was good enough - why now do I have to go thru the extra rigamarole w/ Pottermore? Top that off w/ the fact that you can't loan any of the e-books, & it's a great deterrent to buying any kindle items from her. Just seems greedy at this point."
2,Cardboard box.,The books of course are fantastic. The packaging is a horrible card board box. Just get the books.
1,Disappointed,"I saw this when I was going to order the 7th book. I thought it looked like a cool collecter's edition and thought it worth waiting two months to get the 7th book. I have not received mine yet but I saw some at a bookstore today. Two of the ""Boxed"" sets were broken, the handles had ripped the cardboard. I wanted to cancel my order, but it had already shipped. Wait to see if they will do something nicer to store them in. Ask how a ""privacy lock"" works on a cardboard box?"
4,Harry Potter Boxset Books 1-7,"This item was beautiful and in great condition. It also arrived much sooner than I expected, which was nice. My only complaint is that one book (book 5) was rather seriously damaged. It looked like a manufacturing fault - like something had gone wrong during binding which caused the cover to buckle."
3,"Nice set, but the chest is flimsy...","I'm glad that I bought this set, but the chest is flimsy (cardboard). Also, if you are a collector of first editions, then it should help you to know that most if not all of the books are not first edition first printings. Fortunately, I purchased first editions of the books when they were published, so I'm using the ones that came in the chest as reading copies and have replaced them with my true first editions. Overall, the set is a nice conversation piece and good storage for my first editions. Just wish the chest was of better quality. I realize it would have cost more, but I would have been willing to bear the cost of a nice wooden chest."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"I was really looking forward to this box set as it looks great visually, which is still the case...however, it is a look and don't touch product. I, and probably a lot of other people, would have paid more money to buy something that was better quality. High quality is what you expect from Harry Potter and the people behind this travisty of a cardboard container, have certainly spoilt that aspect of it, as well as missing out on something that could have been better for everybody. The books as you expect are great, but most collectors already have them - people bought this box set for the container and it wasn't worth it, which is a shame, as it was such a good idea that was spoilt to save money or effort."
4,Harry Potter Book Set,"I purchased this a a Christmas gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it. My only concern is that it was to be her ""big surprise"" gift. Well, that didn't happen. The day it arrived, she met the UPS truck at the door and stamped ALL OVER the outside of the box was HARRY POTTER SPECIAL EDITION BOOK SET. There went that surprise...Be sure if you purchase it as a gift, to be there when the delivery is made. The packaging is not in anyway subtle as to its contents!!"
2,Very disappointng,"Books were good condition, but came in a cardboard box and not the wooden one as advertised. VERY VERY VERY disappointing. I suggest buying the books elsewhere and either forget the nice collectible wood box or build one... ridiculous and a sham."
5,Hurray for J.K. Rowling,"It would be amazing to write one fantastic book that millions of people read, but to write 7 FANTASTIC novels is almost unheard of! I must say that Harry Potter is my all time favorite series. I bought the paperback set. All seven books keep you on the edge of your seat reading more and more. My mother got angry at me last summer for reading and reading them non-stop. I was addicted to them, hahaha... There is never a boring moment. From creativity, romance, sports (Quidditch), wisdom, and friendship in Harry Potter books, I rate everything 5 stars. Any book worm would have already read Harry Potter.It is pretty cheap money-wise for the books. The binding does wear. If you are planning on passing it down through your family for generations, definitely get the hard back set.Read 'em all, whether you borrow them from a friend or library, or buy this set!!! You'll definitely love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Christmas Gift,My daughter-in-law loved the set of books. I thought the Boxset had a very neat design and added class to the set of books.
5,"Great books, Good Deal","This Box set was by far the best value if you're looking to buy all the books. They don't mention, but the package comes with some stickers so you kid can personalize the trunk."
1,"This review is for the BOX part of ""boxed set"", not the books","The books are fabulous, but since this is a Collector's edition Boxed Set, I am very disapointed in the box itself, which looks fabulous in the picture but is just plain cardboard and has a faded look (not brightly colored as in the picture). I already have the books, I wanted to have this as a display unit. Very disapointing."
1,Shockingly inferior to Stephen Fry's reading,"I am a very big Jim Dale fan, from Pete's Dragon to Barnum and everything in between, but his reading of these books is tired and gimmicky. He may have won a world record for number of voices but his narration is stale, flat and has no connection to the dialogue. It's as if he recorded the voices and then just read the dialogue in between with no contextual connection.Stephen Fry's readings are exciting, eloquent and dynamic. His voices are equally as entertaining as Dale's with the added bonus of a narration that keeps you engaged throughout. There's no comparison. Buy the Fry reading if you can get it."
2,-_- very dissapointed,"At first my order never got here, I had to email them to let them know and they did send me another book set. But then when I finally received that, it was a paperback set. I had ordered the hardcover set. I emailed them once again, and have not heard back still. It's been over a month. I will not be ordering from them again."
4,"Outstanding value, few frills","Like others reviewing this set, I'll admit that the packaging is less than desirable. The cardboard box was a big disappointment. Beyond that, this is an incredible buy. Add up the cost of these books individually and you'll spend around $200 easy. If you want the Harry Potter series cheap, go for this. If you want pretty packaging, pick up the British version and pay nearly $400."
1,You get ONE book ONLY,I also conferm that you WILL NOT GET ALL THE BOOKS that this item lists. I got one book ONLY and nothing more.
5,Harry Potter and the Ungrateful Fans,"I know everyone is really upset they didn't get a wooden trunk with metal embellishments, a keyed lock, a lifetime supply of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans and a puppy. But really folks...if you seriously thought it would be that you should have questioned the price. Wood and metal and handcraftmanship are significanly more in the money department.It's cardboard, it comes with stickers instead of a puppy, but most important of all: The Books Are Hardbacks. Finding any of the Harry Potter books in hardback, in good condition, is nigh-impossible once they've gone paperback. And when you consider Amazon's discounted price, you are getting a mega-screaming deal.And you know what? I like the cardboard trunk. It looks good on my coffee table's shelf. I think it's a cute bit of marketting and a good offer to the fans as their last chance to get the hardbacks new and pristine."
5,Best Present Ever!,"My husband got me this for Christmas and it was the best thing I got. I love the chest because it keeps the books safe from wear and tear while I'm not reading them. I have been a Harry Potter fan for many years, and it is nice to finally have all the hardcovers for once. The box is just flimsy cardboard but it's nice and still protects the books."
1,"Can you say ""Marketing Ripoff""","This is a very cheap and sleazy way to sell something by pretending that it is something special and delivering something that is not special at all. The impression is that you are recieving a collector caliber box set, specially crafted and assembled. Instead you get a glorified cardboard box. Yes, you get the books. You do not get anything more than that - wait, you now get to have the very common place feeling of getting ripped off once again. Thanks for being a part of this Amazon. You have lost my business, but better to find out now than later."
1,Disappointing price,"This ""sale"" is ridiculous. You can get the entire boxed set at Walmart (I know they suck, but still) for $275 (online price).I'm hoping for a better price with some kind of post-Thanksgiving sale.Save some money. Amazon failed on this one."
2,Harry Potter boxed set,Very cheaply made and put together. The paper is not good and I don't anticipate this lasting for many years.
5,Great Gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a Harry Potter lover. Although she has the paperback books, I thought that thiswould be a great start of a personal library. I was very happy with the books and I thought the box gave it a nicepresentation."
5,Harry Potter Hardcover delight,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old grand daughter. She and the whole family are deligted with the books. She has all the movies, been to the Harry Potter exhibit at Universal in Orlando -- this set of books is the best of all of her Harry Potter collection."
5,A must have for any home library,"This set of Harry Potter books is reasonably priced, probably the best deal you will find. I priced them out everywhere and found Amazon to be the best priced. I bought this set to have for my 'future' kids."
2,Got Mine....Dented,"I'm quite bummed about the box like most others seem to be. I honestly was buying it to have a collector's type of item, which only the box could have succeeded in creating. The books are fine, but the box is cardboard and in my case; very dented cardboard."
1,It Sucks!!! obviously mine is review of Collector boxset not Books,"More than money spent, its the 4 month wait on this box which is the most disappointing & frustating part of this. Why did I have to wait all the time for this cheap cardboard stuff to get the Harry Potter books...Obviously it was a fraud / scam showing a different product image and forgetting to mention anything about its construction material / quality.Still very upset on the how my excitment & wait got busted in getting this probably the most sub-standard collector edition I have ever seen for any product."
4,A Good Read!,"I've seen the Harry Potter movies before, and while I found them entertaining, they really lack the personality and sparkle that the books have.I plan to keep this collection and re-read it many times before I ultimately give it to my son."
1,Harry Potter Boxset books,"Article Arrived Broken, This type of Article for the Money That I spended, Need to be better Pack. Poor Services"
5,Wonderful Gift!,My son received this gift about 3 or 4 years ago and to this day still enjoys the set. Arrived with time to spare and in A1 condition.
3,"Great books, shotty packaging","Although these books are my favorite, they were so well written and thought out properly, I must say I was very disappointed by the packaging that came with the ""collectors set."" I ended up scrapping the whole box and just putting the books on my shelf."
5,harry potter boxset books 1-7,"The seller described the condition of the used books in great detail, which I appreciated. The books did not have to be in mint condition for me. I just wanted them readable and not falling apart and at a reasonable price. I was a little worried about buying used books I could not see and inspect first but these arrived at my home in a timely manner and exactly as described."
3,"Great price, but box set was damaged","Great price & came quickly! However, the box set was damaged & ripped on one side pretty obviously - it was a gift so it would have been nice to know that before purchasing it."
4,Poor Packaging.,"If your ordering this in hopes of having a good case to hold all your books, look some place else. I was disappointed with the quality of the chest. I was afraid when picking it up by the string handles that it might rip right through the cardboard.However, if your buying this for the books only it's a great deal. I'm very happy with the books and the price that I paid for all hardcover. I've been searching for awhile now checking bookstores and whatnot for the hardcover versions and found it hard to find anyone carrying them any longer. Seems everyone went to the paperback set once it came out. So overall I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Up to my expectations,I knew when ordering what I was getting book-wise - great quality hard cover with jacket. As for the case - it is definitely not a heavy duty trunk Harry is travelling with. But my kids had a lot of fun decorating it and two month later it is still in good shape and it was free (if to compare the price of the set vs buying books separately). So no reason to fuss about the case either. The delivery was amazing - ordered it on the 23rd got it the next day in time for Christmas (free delivery).
5,Ideal,"It's just what we ordered and a great price. (I only wish the treasure chest was real wood, but for the price I knew it wouldn't be.) It came in a timely manner. I have no complaints!"
4,Harry Potter paperback boxed set,It is for a Christmas gift. Exactly what I needed at a reasonable price/very good price.
2,Box is cardboard and arrived broken in two places,"The ""Luggage"" box is nothin like what it seems. It's very cheap cardboard and was already split down both of the front corners of the lid when we unwrapped it. There is no checker-pattern on the inside of the lid...it's not colored at all. The biggest appeal of buying a ""Boxed Set"" was to have the box, and it didn't last through manufacturing/shipping. If you are considering as a gift, I'd keep looking."
5,Perfect.,"The books arrived in perfect conditions! Yes, the box may be cardboard and maybe they won't fit when i finish reading them, but hey! Buy it for the books!! It's a great deal. And the shipping was only 2 days all the way to Puerto Rico. I am very satisfied with this purchase.I would recommend this for people who don't own the books."
2,Cheaper at Amazon UK,"This exact same item is significantly cheaper at Amazon UK, even with shipping. Save about $100."
5,The best thing to have!,"I live in India. My Sister and I are big fan of HP. We both received a gift set of seven books from our parents, a UK edition by Bloomsbury and a US edition by Scholastic. Both reached me in 4 days and 5 days respectively. I must say I liked the UK edition for the Front and Back covers and the language nonetheless, though I admit the US edition is bigger, much better pages, and higher overall quality. I had previously read the UK edition from library, which had the best page quality and I had expected this to be of same quality, but Instead I got that in US edition! also the paper trunk is a good thing to have.Though I am, had been and will be a big fan of HP, and I like both the editions. These are the best gifts we had since years."
1,Nice Set but Poor Presentation,"I ordered this set in May because it was advertised as a collectors set,that came in a wooden trunk such as those the Hogwarts Students use. I did NOT expect a tooled wood and leather trunk with real brass corners and hinges, but I certain expected more that what I got. Cheap cardboard with an almost faded look, lackluster brown and black diamond lining (Where's the brightly colored lining from in the picture?), with the corners gapped open (No corner plates, like the ad shows?) and thin stringy handles that want to rip the card board when you use them.I'm not in a generous mood today. I'm not a cheap person, but the reason I bought the set was for the trunk. I already HAD the books, so basically I was willing to pay 117.00 for flimsy cheap carboard that looks nothing like what was advertised back in may."
5,"Jim Dale, Gifted Narrator","I was reading the reviews here and found myself disturbed by the ratings. Once I dug deeper, I found most of the reviews had to do with a book set, not the audio CD's. If you have never listened to Jim Dale (narrator of all 7 HP books in the U.S.), you are truly missing something. He makes the Harry Potter Series even better. This guy is simply gifted at what he does."
1,disappointed..,"i ordered the box set thinking i was going to get the trunk-like box with the set... not so.. i also ordered the set in ""very good"" condition.. i ordered a set that was $30 more so the books would be in better condition.. every cover is torn, bindings are bent, and pages are lightly stained on a few books.. i easily could have bought the books individually in poor condition and saved around $50.. worst purchase i've made so far.. unhappy with amazon!."
5,Harry Potter Box Set,I got this as a gift for my 9 year old son's birthday. He wanted the entire collection and I was glad I could find a set rather than having to buy them individually. He loves them!
5,A must have!,"This series is a definite must-have for any fan. I loved each and every book and could not put any of them down. I wanted to know so badly what happened in the last book, that I read book 7 in a day!It was amazing with how much thought Rowling developed the world and captivated generations.I would definitely recommend the english edition though, because I did not like it, that the original name for the first book was changed for the American market."
1,Poorly done....,"I wish I had read more reviews about this product before purchase. I was surprised the so-called trunk was just cardboard. Mine arrived in very poor shape. One corner is totally ripped apart, the cheap plastic lock is broken, and one of the handles is only half attached. If I had seen this in a store, I wouldn't have given it a second look. I bought it as a gift and I don't have time to return it, but I will certainly be taking a closer look at reviews in the future."
5,Better than the American version,"Was surprised at the many differences between the British and American versions. These are the adult, cloth books, and were in alost perfect condition when they arrived. I was a little disappointed with the flimsy box they sit in though, I expected something a little sturdier. Still giving them 5 stars because I am an avid Harry Potter fan and these books are amazing, I got them to read so not to worried about the case. And the price was EXCELLENT"
3,ok,bought it for a Christmas present...seems to be in good shape and I got what I was expecting to get
5,Brilliant!,"This trunk is a great piece to hold your favorite Harry Potter books in.Though it's only cardboard, it is sturdy and has a working clasp to hold it close.All the books came in perfect condition and sealed, and the stickers were a great added bonus.I bought this to replace my tattered old set of these books, and I am so glad I did!"
5,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7),"Product was as described, my son loves them.Shipping was quick and delivered without incident.Would do business again without hesitiation."
5,So what if it's cardboard?,"I wasn't expecting anything more than cardboard for the price. Other boxed sets of books come in a cardboard case. Why should this be any different? Nothing in the description says the case is wooden, and there's no reason it should be wooden. If you want a wooden case for it, have one made yourself.The books, of course, are fantastic."
4,Lots of great reading,I love the hard back book set. This is something I have been waiting for. The box is not the greatest quality (don't pick it up by the string handles). It made a good heavy Christmas gift.
4,about the Harry Potter box set,"I LOVE Harry Potter and the books. For this Chistmas I want to have the box set, but all of the reviews say that the box is made of cardboard. I'm not sure if that's true, but when I get the set and see that it is true, than I'm going to make my own box. I could measure the perimeter of the books together and ask my Dad to get the supplies and we could make our own Harry Potter trunk to put the books in. So it won't be a rip off to get the set!"
4,Good Books Bad Trunk,"I have recently receive myHarry Potter Boxset Books 1-7. I have to say that the trunk as all may know is made of cheap capboard. If you dont have the seven books of this amazing story, and you really want to have them you should buy it. But if you are buying the boxset only for the trunk you then will be very angry because the trunk is awful. The books all come in a good state and the stickers are amazing."
1,"Great books, HORRIBLE box","I am not alone in thinking that the display box is a complete waste of time. I was expecting something more sturdy then cardboard, and maybe with a metal clasp/lock. Is that too much to ask? The books are shrink wrapped, and the whole package came in a fairly good protective shipping box. The display box was nothing more then a dissappointment though."
2,Defective books,"I originally gave this 5 stars for the price, in spite of the cheap cardboard trunk, but due to the publisher's and Amazon's poor quality control, I must give this a lower rating. Book 4 has a section of duplicate pages where missing pages should be, and Book 7 has creased pages with blurred print. Amazon will not replace individual books within the set, so I must take all 18 lbs to UPS and make arrangements to be home for another UPS delivery."
2,Less Than Expected,"We actually found this box set in the store (the mega super chain we all love to hate, yet continue to shop there ... you know the one.)The ""trunk"" is average grade cardboard and the ""lock"" is flimsy decorative plastic. The box, on a whole, is kinda shabby. One accidental drop and this trunk is going to be permanently damaged.While it's really fantastic that they've put together an entire box set of the books, I think people would have been willing to pay the price for a better quality set. I would have. I'm really glad I'm not the one who paid $100+ for it. I hope that when they finish all the movies and put them into a box set it's of better quality than the book set. If you're a mega fan, grab it while you can. If you're not that crazy about owning all the Potter goodies, skip this."
5,a collection worth keeping,"I grew up with Harry Potter and I really want any children I might have to one day grow up with Harry too. That's why I made the investment to purchase this book set. Having not only a copy of every book in hardcover but a box that serves as a display, a carrying case and a means in which to protect the books also is a great way to ensure that one day my future generations can fall in love with Harry just like I did."
5,Thanks so Much!,"I got the books, and they are in great shape. The package came so quickly, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you so much!!!!!!"
5,You should be buying it for the books!,"I'm laughing at those who say the trunk was listed on Amazon as a wooden trunk! Because it certainly was not listed that way.Buy this set for the books inside! And...we should be rating this set on the books...not the trunk/box!If you're looking to own all of the books in the Harry Potter series, this is by far the best deal you're going to find. The ""cardboard"" trunk is a fun added bonus.If you want a high quality wooden box...go find and buy one. You're certainly going to pay a few $$$! People are funny...some want something for nothing. Amazon already has this set priced as a steal! Technically you're getting a couple books for free here!"
4,Awesome!,"This was an excellent set of Harry Potter books. I bought them for my 10 year old daughter and she is absolutely delighted with them! The books even come in a sturdy, beautifully decorated case!"
5,Good buy,"Bought for my daughter who likes Harry Potter and trying to encourage her to read more and play less video games. Already through the second book and starting the third. Amazon fulfilled the order quickly. Good value overall to buy set rather than one by one. Wish they were available as ebooks for Kindle or IPad, but JK Rollins doesn't permit ebooks for Harry Potter... Guess if you are a billionaire author, you can publish any way you want...."
3,THE TRUNK IS JUNK!!,"As stated previously, the books in this collection deserve 5 stars each. I have to wonder what they were thinking when the final decision was made that this pitiful ""trunk"" was just dandy to house such a phenominal collection of books. I can just see it falling apart over a period of years. Take a look at the ""trunk"" used for the DVD collection of the first five Harry Potter films. That trunk at least has a real metal latch and is NOT made of cardboard. The publishers should keep in mind that their are plenty die-hard fans that are willing to pay the extra cash for a quality collectible. Forget it! I'll hold out for a swanky collecor's set of books worth a heftier price tag (one of these days you know there will be another and better set to shell out the bug bucks for)."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this because the price is great and the fact that they all come in a neat little cardboard collectors box is cool. Let me begin by saying, the box is nice, not amazing, it has some cool art that resembles that from the books, and it is a convenient way to store the books all together. It isn't anything to base your purchase of the book set off of, but I honestly think it's a nice addition to the already very affordable set of books. That's less than $10 a book, quite a bit less, and with super saver shipping...wow, what a deal. The packaging was great, and I did 2 day shipping and it was here in one day, don't know how that happened, but Amazon is the place to buy this for sure, and it's well worth the price!"
5,Jim Dale narrates the Potter stories with great emotion.,"Jim Dale narrates the Potter stories with great emotion. He gives a voice to each charcter making them as unique as Rowling did in writing. Great for new readers, long trips, and background ""noise"". I put them on while I am working around the house I love it!"
2,Rip in one cover,This item arrived as described and was nicely packaged. The books were also sealed in plastic inside the collector box. The only problem with this item is that the paper cover of the second book has a slit/rip in it. In order to get a replacement cover I would have to ship the whole set back. I ordered this book collection from amazon to avoid minor problems like this and was disappointed.
3,How bad do you want the collection?,"The box of books arrived swiftly, well packaged with no damage. The 'collectible' Harry Potter 'trunk' is okay, but being printed cardboard, will probably get worn and torn quickly. The clasp is NOT self explanatory (unless, of course your name is Harry)."
4,great deal....,"good deal with box although its made of cardboard, but better then the regular set priced at $200 at indigo and with no box!"
3,"The Books Are Great, The Box Not So Much So","It goes without saying that the Harry Potter books are great. Everyone knows that so I really can't add much there; however, the special box that the books comes in is what makes the difference with this package.If I were rating this on just the packaging, I would probably give it 1 or 2 stars at best. But the books are part of the deal so I didn't go that low. My wife got this as a present for me and I'm looking forward to sharing these books with my little son one day. In the meantime I had to put it away because he could destroy the whole package in a few minutes. The flimsy lock on the front is a joke.In conclusion, if you want all the books in the series without fuss this is for you. If you want them in a sturdy, long-lasting case, you might want to look elsewhere.PATRICK RALEY is the author of the mystery, detective novel entitled ""Precedent of Justice"".

2,Review on Scholastic Box Set,"As reviews for all box sets (regardless of publishers) are lumped together, I thought to give feedback on the Scholastic Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7) which I just received today. A review on the story content has received enough coverage so I will only focus on the quality of the box and book quality. The box overall is sturdy enough and acceptable (even though there was a little dent at one corner but that's a delivery issue). However, I am disappointed by the quality of the paper and the small font size, which is surprising for a set targeted at children.I compared the quality of this set to that of a borrowed book that was published by Bloomsbury and the latter was much better on both paper quality and font size so I would recommend that set instead, which I think has a similar cost in Amazon UK. I lived outside US so I am not going to bother returning this set but if I would have if I reside there."
4,Good present,"The box set arrives nicely packed in a mailed box, but the ""treasure box"" you see in the picture is pretty fragile. Since the set is pretty expensive anyway, they could make it from wood.I recommend this as a present to any Harry Potter fan!"
3,Don't Buy as Christmas Present...,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas. Had it delivered of course...The outside of the shipping box says ""Harry Potter Boxed Set 1-7"" in HUGE letters along the sides. Totally ruined that surprise.Not concerned about the cardboard, as that it says right in the description that it is cardboard. I am just so upset that they had to ship it with the description on the box."
1,Don't buy it,"This is clearly not a review for the books as they are fantastic. This is for the cheap cardboard box they arrived in. I read many reviews that lash out on customers who ""expected too much"" and I guess I am one of them. What the 5 star reviewers don't understand is that this box set was represented as a collector's item and many people who bought this item bought it for this reason and not necessarily for the books that they/we already have. For someone who does not own any of the books I agree that this is a very good deal but for the rest of the people who are interested in a collection item this is simply the worst purchase you will make (or already did).Very disappointing."
1,Hosed,"Like the others, I know for a fact that the pre release description was a WOODEN box. As I bought the books as gift, the receipient will not share my disappointment and will love the books and probably throw the box away in the other Christmas wrapping trash. This is the first time I recall a deceptive description from Amazon, and I am very disappointed by it."
2,"Books great, box not so great.","I was going to get this as a gift to me so I could have a full set of the Harry Potter books kept nicely tucked away. However, I had the chance to examine this box set at the local bookstore and I was definitely disappointed. I would rather spend a little more money, and actually get something of value instead of a cardboard box.I also agree with a previous reviewer, if the point of getting a box set is to have a perserved set of books - why put the additional items inside the shrink wrapping.I am going to hold off and not get this set. I am hoping that perhaps the poor reviews will be heard and the company will put out a ""delux"" version with a decent box that is worth the money and a suitable home for these awesome books."
1,Not what I ordered,When I ordered this it very specifically said a wood case. This is cardboard. I am going to ask for a refund.
1,DAMAGED GOODS,"I received the Harry Potter Seven Book Set and promptly started reading from book one.However, once I got to the Fifth book I was shocked to see that nearly 40 pages have been hacked off.Pages 831- 870 are severed at the top and two full sentences are missing from the tops of all of these pages.Very disappointed as I have grown to love the Harry Potter books."
1,Very Bad Print,"I concur with Julie's review. This is an extremely poor print. 48 pages in book 5 are duplicated, with the intervening pages missing. In other words, pages 687-734 don't exist. I would have expected a better quality, especially with the commercial success this series has had. Although, it appears they cut corners with the print, probably to save/make money. In all my years, this is the worst printing job I have ever seen. Amazon has kindly sent new copies, even over night. I will post an update if the problem persists."
1,CHECK EACH AND EVERY CD!!!!!,"I so looked forward to this item, and when it arrived I opened it right away; thank god I did. Some collections contained duplicated CDs with others missing. Amazon was very helpful to rectify the problem and even allowed me to check the next package to make sure I wound up with a complete set.I give this a one star review so you will read this, still buy this awesome collection, but immediately check each and every CD when it arrives."
1,missing book 1?,"Although this boxed set arrived in a timely manner and was received in excellent condition, it was Missing book 1 and contained 2 copies on book 2! This was no fault of either Amazon or the bookseller i purchased it from but rather the publisher who packaged the set as it was shrink wrapped when I opened it! Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a volume one from this edition, to complete the set as it was supposed to be a collectible! Quite a lot of work ahead of me for a Christmas present which was anticlimactic to say the least!"
4,Use with kid gloves!,"Though the price is nice, the packaging is not. Very flimsy and low quality. Plastic latch will break easily if not careful. The books themselves are wrapped, but the box will deteriorate after time if it is not treated well. Would have been five stars if not for the packaging."
3,Don't buy this for the chest!,"I had not bought any of the Harry Potter books yet because I was waiting for a final set. The price is usually cheaper than buying them all separately and I was hoping for some kind of collector's casing. The ""chest"" really isn't of collector quality. It is adequate enough to hold the books but will need to be treated with care in order for it not to be ruined. The reason I still gave this item 3 stars is because of the price that I paid ~ $115. At that price this is still a good deal for the books and it's like you get the box for free. However, it is definitely not worth the MSRP price. If you just want the books and can get it at that price then go for it. But, if you are a true Harry Potter fan and want a collector's set I would hold out for something better."
5,Happy with this books. Good quality and very fast shipment,Happy with this books. Good quality and very fast shipment. My son love it. New books. Received in three days.
1,Where's my order?,"I wonder when's my order going to arrive???i ordered last july 24, 2010 and the estimated date of delivery is Sept. 6 but it's October already (more than 3 months now)and i haven't have any news of my order yet. Please do something about it. thanks!"
2,Good only on CD,"I haven't listened to much of the actual audio but I am extremely disappointed in that Listening Library has made it virtually impossible to download these CDs on to my Zune. In several of the books, there are mis-labeled CDs and in one of the book sets, all the CDs are labeled the same. For example, the first book (Sorcerer's Stone) there are 7 CDs but only 6 made it into my Zune library due to mis-labeling one of the CDs.[...]?"
4,Harry Potter Collection,"I have one compliant, the desciption said like new still in plastic. They neglected to mention the box that holds all 7 books was damaged and torn even though it was still in the plastic. All the books and covers are in great shape it is just the box they go in that is damaged. That was a very expensive item and I was rather disappointed. A first with my Amazon dealings."
2,Disappointed,I read all the books straight through but when I got to book 5 there was over 100 pages missing from the middle of the book. I had to borrow someone elses to finish it. I have tried unsuccessfully to contact Amazon.com but cannot find a number.... I would love to have this book replaced so my set is complete. Please help.....
1,Very Cheep Through Away Packaging,"I was very disapointed in this product. It appeared to have a nice chest in which the books could be stored and displayed. The packaging is a throw away, not much better than the cardboard shipping box. Really very sad. The box is essentially a poorly constucted cardboard gift wrap. I am a little ashamed to give this as a gift, as it looks very cheep, somethinging like the disposable box an inexpensive toy would come-in. Really to bad..."
5,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set,My 10 year old grandson was thrilled to receive these books as a Christmas gift. He is enjoying reading them.
5,Awesome books!,This set of books is in the coolest box. My daughter will be thrilled when she receives them for her birthday!
4,NOT A READER!,"I am not a reader, but my friend is. She was going through a HP phase, so I got her the set and she loves it."
5,Great Audiobooks!,"I really loved this audiobook collection. I have read all the Harry Potter books in English and in Spanish and it was great to hear all the books narrated by Jim Dale. I would recommend this product, it's simply great!!You get all 7 audiobooks, that makes a total of 99 CD'S."
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with the books. I knew the box was going to be cheap and it's just made out of cardboard and like others have in their reviews it has unfinished edges. But I really don't mind (it'll help protect the books better than if they were out in the open or on a bookshelf), I thought it was cute and it was on sale and I wanted my own set of Harry Potter books since we just have a family set and once I'm on my own I didn't want to have to fight over them. The stickers are nice, not sure what I'm going to do with them yet, I don't want to put them on the box. But overall the books were all in brand new condition and I'm looking forward to rereading the series again."
3,It's the box....ugh,"I read all the reviews...and yes I am disapointed that the box is cardboard and is cheaper beyond all belief....but what I can't believe is that some of you were expecting WOOD yes acutal wood...I knew that wasn't going to happen...I was hoping for pressboard and maybe some plastic ""metal moulding"" on the sides....but yeah the box is a huge disappointment...and I did notice that the description on amazon changed after the product shipped...how sad it that....oh well....live and learn...still makes me mad"
1,VERY CHEAP QUALITY,I expected the case to be made of wood and be alot nicer than it really is. It is made of flimsy cardboard and plastic!!! I am glad that I am not the only one that thinks this!
2,"great books, cheap package","My sentiments follow the others. I pulled the set out of the shipping box and just stared at the lame cardboard packaging. Seriously, what were they thinking?"
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"The only reason this product deserves even its one star is simply for containing seven completely and enchantingly amazing books. As for the boxset itself, it is a thrown together hunk of plastic-coated cardboard that can't be worth 10 cents, plus a few decorative stickers. If you want an attractive, durable, and lasting container for your Harry Potter books, buy one separately because this ripoff doesn't meet any of those qualifications. The only thing I can say for it is that it will cover them from dust, and I could vouch the same for a paper grocery bag or a sheet of plastic wrap."
1,If I know the box was going to be this cheap!!!,"I could have bought the books for $30 less and had them this summer... Instead I waited until this cheap piece of ... I did not expect an cedar chest or anything of that nature, but cardboard?!? Really I guess I had an extra few bucks to toss down the toilet, don't you?!?"
1,Disappointed,"I feel misled, too. I've already printed my return label to use when my box arrives on Monday. All I've been waiting to get since the 5th book is a set of all seven books in a nice slipcase. Scholastic did that each time a new book was added to the series until now. Why not do the same now? So, I'll wait. Maybe I'll see what the British publisher has to offer."
3,O.K.,I find it quite expensive for a paperback. Quality is O.K. though.Next time I would rather spend more for having the hard cover...
5,harry potter complete boxset,"nice for h.p. fans to have all the books collected in a nice box (not made in wood, mind you). the box is well done and creates quite an atmosphere of magic. the printings of the books are very nice to read. the books themselves are simply fantastic (as anyone who's been reading h.p. books knows).only one thing: in the box there should be also ""quidditch through the ages"" and ""fantastic beasts and where to find them"". just to complete!"
2,Disappointed in packaging,"I advance ordered the book set when I first learned of its offering during the late Spring. This was for my daughter who is an avid Potter fan (she had previously purchased all the books first as paperbacks and then later as hard cover versions). I wanted to give her a special collector's complete set from the publisher and thought when ordering that it was to come in a substantial wooden packaging. I gave it to her for her birthday unopened. When she opened it, I was disappointed to find that the special packaging was merely printed cardboard folded into a double-thick box. I was expecting more myself, but my daughter was happy to have a complete set of new books."
1,Waste of money - just a cheap cardboard box.,"It's my fault for not reading the description more carefully -- I was so excited to give this to my daughter for Christmas that I overlooked the fact that the box was cardboard and not wood. It's an incredibly cheap cardboard box, at that. It was a huge disappointment.This would have been so much better if it was made out of wood, and could be a true heirloom.We already had at least two copies of each book, but I bought this with the idea that it would be something my daughter could keep forever and pass along to her kids. Not so. The cardboard will start to tear and separate just as a result of removing the books from time to time."
4,Bad delivery,"The product was exactly as described on the web. there was delivery damage though. that packaging was ripped as if pierced by a hook of somesort and that damage also punctured the product packaging. the actual books were not damaged, but the case that holds all the books was damaged.the product and the company did their job flaelessly. the packaging was also done well that is should have been protected by most bumps and normal delivery handleling, but the outside packaging was torn as if it was pierced by a large metal hook or piece.It went through the outside box, the packing material and ultimately pierced and damaged the case of the product."
4,Not bad,"My son received these as a Christmas present last year and was thrilled to get them.It's his first ""set"" of books and he likes that they have their own box. I, personally, would have preferred something a little sturdier, but at least the kid is happy."
4,Happy but disappointed,"I was very happy about receiving all the books in one case, but i was disappointed that the case is made from cardboard. i was under the impression this would be a sturdy box made from some other materials. aside from that disappointment, this is an excellent product."
2,Very cheap container,I purchased the book set so my son would have the entire series in hard cover. I was very disappointed that the decorative container was simply a card board box. For the price I expected a higher quality box.
4,wonderful book set!,I'm a big fan of Harry Potter. This is a wonderful book set and I will recommend it to all you guys who are also a fan of harry potter.
4,What to expect,As long as you are aware that it is a nice box and not a full size trunk looking item. That it's exactly what you want
2,Bad deal,"Good deal, excellent presentation, in front of view, but the paper inside is the worst as possible."
5,Harry Potter Paper Back Box Set,"This set was new and perfect condition. The shipping was also very expedient. Happy, happy customer."
5,Awesome boxset,"The box it comes in is a cardboard box but it is a neat case. It would be better if it was made from a different material, but it is still nice and the books are all great."
5,Got IT !,I wanted the entire set of Harry Potter Books. I don't usually collect sets of books. I really like the stories of Harry Potter and will buy more if He surfaces in more stories in the future.
4,H. Potter Boxset 1-7,Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she loved the set. They're all tucked nicely in a somewhat sturdy cardboard trunk. Great price for set. I checked other stores. I would recommend the set to everyone who loves Harry Potter.
3,Cool idea but ....,Loved the idea but was very disappointed with the chest. For the price you'd think it would be more sturdy so it could be a collector's item.
4,Defective product replaced quickly,"When I received my full set of HP CDs, the Sorcerer's Stone set was missing the 7th CD. The return process was pretty painless, and amazon quickly sent me a replacement. Thanks amazon!"
3,harry potter boxed set,I didn't realise until I got my boxed set that there was a different American and British version of Harry Potter. The most glaring being the change of title from The pholosophers stone to The sorcerers stone I would not have bought it if I had known. Having said that the books are of good quality and the trunk is really cute
5,Great Box Set,"Product is as pictured. The box is cardboard, but sturdy. Books are well-made, with attractive dust jackets and are very nice to look at on the shelf."
4,Beautiful Books!,"I love my set, which I got some six months ago. They are absolutely stunning to look at. Of course, I have never read this set, as they are purely for decoration, but they are beautiful all the same. I use the box to hold all of my ""reading copies"" of the same books. The set comes with bright stickers for decorating your very own ""trunk"" which show the different places mentioned through out the Harry Potter universe.The only problem I've had out of this product is the fact that the latch doesn't work. In fact, it broke off after the first use. However, it snaps back on fairly easily, but you must be very careful when handling the box."
4,hmmmmmmmmm!!!!!,"I am a big Harry Potter fan and am no less than thrilled to pieces to finally own the complete set of books. (and in hardback no less) The books in this collector's set are the same books (content, artwork, cover and all) that have been sold before individually.Yet I'm somewhat disappointed, if not slightly disillusioned that the ""special collectors case"" was a huge letdown. Given the obvious fact that Harry is huge worldwide, it would had behooved the publishers to do right by this commemorative set and make the case out of engineered wood (at the very least!) Instead they opted for the cheaper route and decided to make it out of... drum roll please.... CARDBOARD!I dunno, maybe I was expecting to much?! (sigh...) 5 stars for Harry & minus one for the presentation..."
3,Buy on amazon.co.uk much cheaper,"These are great books, and definitely worth having for the collector. This is not a review of the books, but a review of the price. You are getting ripped off if you pay over $200 for these books. You can buy this exact set on amazon.co.uk which is the british version of amazon for 120 pounds plus shipping (which at the exchange rate today is equal to $176 plus shipping). So please look at the amazon.co.uk website like i did and save yourself a whole lot of money. Buyer Beware of sellers like this trying to con you into thinking they are giving you a deal."
3,Missing pages,"Loved the books, didn't care about the cardboard boxMad as hell that book four is missing 31 pages (pages 675-706 are no in the book while pages 643-674 are repeated)"
4,"Good price on books, covers torn","I bought this set as a college graduation present for my daughter. It was a very good deal on the books themselves: I had bought my set one at a time for about $30 each, so this was less than half that price. She was a little disoppointed that the chest was so flimsy, but mostly that several of the dustcovers were wrinkled and torn. We are bibliophiles in my family, and we treat books with careful respect, and we have books that are decades old that are in better shape than these came new. I offered to trade dustcovers with her, as mine are in much better shape even after being read many times by many people, but she didn't want to do that."
5,Love the complete set,Over the years my HP books were either worn or loaned out and not returned. My 12 year old was wanting to read the set and this was a great gift. Includes all books with a nice holder to keep them altogether. Great for a gift!
5,Harry Potter,"If you haven't read these books already, you are far behind on the times. This is a great book series that I strongly suggest to people of just about any book reading age. Of course you have to read the books BEFORE watching the movies in order to fully appreciate them. Great buy, no need for hardback these books are wonderful!"
5,awesome,"awesome, the quality of item and the shipment time both are quite o k : ) i am happy with it"
3,"Great Books, but wish I would have bought them new",Some of the books smelled really bad...not sure where they were being stored. Was not very happy about how they were wrapped either. Some ended up a bit bent when they got to me due to wrapping. Otherwise order was was fine.
3,Harry Potter,Harry Potter booksPicture showed it came in the orignal box. It did not. It was a Christmas present.Was packed good.
2,Regarding the Harry Potter Hardcover Box Set,"This is really the first time I have been disappointed in something purchased at the Amazon site. The set was not in a box but that had been discussed and accepted by the seller and myself. But, the books had been written in and were very used. Also, the packing box was not in very good condition so the transit ride was not kind and the box was crushed. Overall, my daughter is glad to have the set but my husband and I were unhappy with the purchase."
1,A Real Bad One,"I bought this CD, and after hearing how bad the sound quality was on this live recording, I got rid of it. The argument about this being a live recording is paltry at best. Just because a band records a live album does not mean they should release bad sound quality. Anyone who knows anything about music knows that live recording is about the band performance, recording mix, and the final mastering done in the studio. I've heard audience recordings sound better than this mess released by Maiden. To coincide with Bruce Dickinson's final tour with Iron Maiden, the band issued two live recordings, A REAL LIVE DEAD ONE, and A REAL DEAD ONE. In fact, the two ""Dead One"" live releases have the worst sound quality of any released live recording by any band, and this is from a band that released ""Maiden Japan"" and ""Live After Death."" The band doesn't sound as inspired as it does on its previous live collections."
2,There's a reason why this band's appeal is limited to a cult following...,".....they're just not that good. Don't get me wrong, I'd have a blast banging my head with Eddie if I ever got the chance. Clearly, this CD does NOT represent the band at its best. But it does demonstrate that worthwhile IM songs are few and far between....I rather enjoyed the one time I saw them live (alas, it was on videotape), but I must say, once was enough. I certainly won't be spending any time listening to this poorly mixed live set full of sub-par material. Doesn't do it for me at all.P.S. - as I'm sure this review is guaranteed to tee off dedicated Maidenheads, allow me to point out that I actually love the band that features Bruce Dickinson's brother Rob on lead vocals - Catherine Wheel. As far as I'm concerned, they're one of the best bands ever."
1,WHY??,"Why would I bother to buy an Maiden album featuring one of the worst phases of their career, recorded during the last tour with Bruce Dickinson, where he sang without any passion. Also, to handle Janick Gers guitar playing is something very difficult. The worst guitarrist ever!"
3,Who Mixed this?,"A real Live dead one is the worst sounding Maiden album. It sounds like a better than average sound board bootleg. The whole band sounds like they're in a hurry to get off the stage. I enjoy ""Live One"" much more than ""dead"" mostly because we hadn't heard these songs live yet. I originaly got these when they were individually released back in the early 90's. The only true great live version out of the two is ""fear of the Dark"" and in my opinon, The only reason to buy this. If you want a great live album, stay with Live after Death, Live in rio, or Flight 666 they are all excelent. Death on the road is ok.Up the Irons!!!!!"
5,Bizarre foods for Bizarre people.,"Me and my husband absolutely love this program. My husband especially likes the Phillipines because the people are friendly and they have good food. I like the one in Morocco, because I laugh over and over during the scene when he eats putrid meat, and hits his head with his hands. We enjoy it repeadedly."
2,Not a good choice.,"I used this with my first and it was very awkward. You have to snap it around your neck, it's not very big so there's a chance of not being completly covered and it doesn't breathe. My daughter would overheat and have a sweaty little head each time I would use this. Look around there are much nicer cover ups better made."
5,General lee T Shirt,"The item was of great quality, arrived in good time and all around me were so pleased with it I have started a bit of a trend. Excellent, and a must have item."
2,Don't Peep,"I only bought this because I am a huge fan of Michael C Hall. The story was very disjointed and weird. When it ended, I found myself thinking, ""Huh?"""
3,expensive for what it is,"I purchased this for my grandmother who has a hard time standing. It has basic weight adjustments and the design is simple, but the materials are not high quality. The padding only lasted a few months, lucky she had a pillow bout the same size so she uses that. It does help her significantly, so I can overlook the cheapness of it since it does the job. The price is a bit high but there arent many options so..."
2,First try to open it!!,"Hard to figure out how to use.Throws you off balance after trying to get up with itMostly elderly folks use this and it is extremely hard to figure out, let alone use it."
5,Daugther bought for my wife for Xmas,"My daughter bought this lift chair for my wife for Xmas and this what she needed to help her off her Lazy Boy Chair. It has become a problem for her to get up. I had to help her up. She no longer needs help with this Lift Chair. It's terrific, she loves it. What a great invention!Larry and Maxine"
2,Disapointing,"I love this group but this CD is not what I expected.It has mostly very dull songs, it is like they are warming up before starting the show but never quite get there.Keep the group in mind but buy a different CD."
5,Most important item on my desk,"Well, not the MOST important item on my desk, but close to it. It squeezes well, a bit too firm for my tastes but over time I'm sure it'll soften with use. It has an excellent bounce, for not being a bouncy ball.Not much really to say, except that if I didn't have this item I would be in a lot of trouble. Sometimes I squeeze it, sometimes I toss it between my hands, but mostly I bounce it between my hands and my desk. I do this constantly, when I am not typing, and it keeps me focused and the mind working. As a writer, this is important. When I am struggling with a word or phrase, I grab this ball, play with it a bit, and it helps unlock my creativity. Keeping the body active keeps the mind sharp, and if you're sitting there in front of a computer, you're not really moving otherwise. A toy like this, simple yet multipurpose, is perfect for keeping the body active in a variety of small ways.If this fails, I go lift weights."
3,Interesting,"You need an ego to build a company as large and successfully as Sir Richard has put together and that ego are captured by the author. The author gives us a view into the career of Mr. Branson from the start - the standard biography structure. The author did try to sneak in one or two items that are a bit on the tabloid side, but overall it looked to be a fair and complete review. I was most interested in how he structured his companies and moved from one to the next - I assumed he continued to own them, but that is not the case. Overall and interesting book that is enjoyable. If you are interested in the man then this would be a good starting point."
4,Interesting person--Biography just so-so,"While Richard Branson is an interesting person, the biography I considered just so-so. My main disappointment was what I thought was a real ""gloss over"" of the period when Virgin was just starting its rise. It seemed to me that within a page or two, Branson's life jumped from being hounded by creditors to being a millionaire. There didn't seem to be sufficient focus on that crucial time.There are some strong points--I found the balloon episode quite fascinating, and there are many other details about Virgin's later rise to financial success and power that seemed sufficiently detailed. It was just that ""lapse"" of detail of what was the threshold period in Banson's (and Virgin's) transition to success and prominence that I considered wanting."
3,DEWALT DW6601 1/8 Inch General Purpose Bit (5 pack),Worked great on drywall...not so great on anything else I tried to cut out. General Purpose should be drywall only...1/8 is not that big and they tend to easily break as can be expected by the size of the shaft.
2,A little disappointed...,"The lights are easy to assemble, but are not as bright as I would like. They are prone to rust, and even though the seller was kind enough to replace my original order, the new ones have already started to rust as well."
4,cool book,brief book is very interesting... full of intersting obervations about human-computer interaction and information seeking via the web.
2,Popular history,"I am sure Mr King could write a fine scholarly work on Olof Rudbeck, but he or his publisher decided to aim for a wider market and the book strives to be 'popular'. Maybe this is a good idea, but it will annoy some readers. I confess I was disappointed. Talk of 'Apollo's dad' seems inappropriate to me, and I did not want events such as Columbus' discovery of the Americas explained so carefully. There is interesting material here, but you have to decide whether the packaging suits you before you read this book."
2,Missing the dust jacket,You would think that if a seller were listing a book on Amazon.com and it didn't come with the dust jacket that the seller would be obligated to mention that tiny little fact.
5,Good,Great shipping speed. I live outside the U.S and got the book within a week. It was written only in 10 pages and in pencil so it was easy to erase the answers! Great book for EFL Students. Great price aswell!
5,The Best Christmas Gift for Elementary School Teachers Ever!,"I was so delighted to find this Christmas ""gem"" this past year. Having taught 1st grade for several years before becoming a principal, I know that the series of events described and depicted in this book are in fact reality. I laughed out loud, and then ordered a copy for every one of my teachers for Christmas. Best of all, as they read their new books aloud to their children, the halls of our school were filled with laughter! Mr. Layne and Mr. Rice brought a lot of joy our way this season. Thanks so much!"
2,For Really Serious Gene Fans,This is only for people really serious about their Gene Clark collection that need/should have everything of his available. Not my favorite among Gene music or quality.
3,Nice reference.,"For the money, this is as a nice reference book for procedures. It would easily fit in a book bag or locker. My gripe has to do with the photos and illustrations. As an art major, poor line drawing s and black and white stock photos from the 1960's kill me when I see them in books like this. Good illustrators and models are dirt cheap, let's quite rehashing the same photo's. This is a digital/visual era where a handheld devices have 1080 HD and ""retina"" displays. Consumers are simply expecting more now."
5,Keeps my 2 1/2 yr old entertained for hours,"My son is obsessed with airplanes and helicopters, so we thought this would be a great gift for him for Christmas and we were right! It's a little complicated for him at this age to construct any of the aircraft without help, but he loves to make all sorts of other things with the pieces as does my 5 1/2 year old daughter. I love the fact that their using their imaginations and are so proud of the things they build. I definitely recommend this toy and will look into purchasing other Superstructs sets."
5,We enjoy the superstructs,My four year old is excited every day to create a new vehicle or airplane. He likes following the instructions and making his own creations. This has been a good toy for motor skills and creativity.
3,"Educational, but !!!","I have an 11 y/o, and an 8 y/o. We sat down when we got it, and were very excited to play with it. At first I saw the 8 year old frustration building up, so I started helping, and then I saw my self helping my 11 year old with it too, at the end both weren't interested in it. The toy is educational, you can build several items, but sometimes you have to be careful with the sticks. They look like durable, but I don't know for how long. Any how the Toy is Educational, but just not interesting enough."
4,They're EL84 Tubes...,"These are JJ tubes relabeled and tested by Groove Tubes. JJ's aren't really the best at anything IMO, but, they do get the job done.Had one red-plate after playing on it for a while. Might be the amp, might be the tube. Either way, it hasn't done it since, so, I don't know for sure.Also, Ruby's EL84 is the same tube, just relabeled and tested by Ruby...and with less markup than GT."
3,This card does work but is cheaply made,"After trying many similar cards, the Belkin card seems to work more reliably than most. However, in light of it's very high price, it is quite annoying to find the card is put together so poorly (or perhaps of cheap parts) that it will fall apart at the slightest trauma. This card is put together cheaply so the warranty that comes with it was appealling. However, do not count on Belkin to honor the warranty or to even reply to requests for warranty repair, etc. They have ignored all of my attempts to get any response about warranty coverage over a two year period so watch out for this and possibly other Belkin products."
3,It works on an old Toshiba,What can you say except that it works on an old Toshiba laptop I use as a printer server and have a scanner hooked to. You have to provide plug-in power to do anything however. Won't even recognize a thumb drive unless outside power supplied. Decreases time of 38GB backup from 8 hours to 3. Can you believe how long USB 1 took?
4,USB 2.0 Notebook Card,"I used the notebook card to add a 2.0 USB port to my Gateway notebook in order to clone my harddrive to a larger new harddrive. The directions were easy to follow; however, the driver disk sent with the product was out of date, so my computer defaulted to the slower USB 1.1 drivers internal to my computer. I had to contact Belkin to locate updated drivers. Once I did, the USB 2.0 card worked as advertised. I would recommend the product. It came with an instruction manual and a driver disk. The manual had a contact number for Belkin support."
5,Indispensible!,"The book of Daniel was ""sealed and concealed"" until the ""time of the end"". We are rapidly approaching the time of the end and finally, the unsealing and revealing of the meaning of the still future prophecies of the book of Daniel. The author is a Hebrew scholar and provides a corrected translation of the text daniel 9:25-27 and, as the old television commercial used to say, ""this changes everything"". It is not for the faint hearted and may take considerable time to digest. Don't just take the author's word for it, check out what he says. It is well worth the effort, if you want to begin opening up your understanding of prophetic interpretations that are long established as dogma, but are just simply wrong. I've had a copy for years and still refer to it from time to mind. It's not for everyone, but if you are a SERIOUS student of Bible prophecy, it is, well, indispensible!"
2,Disappointing Quality,"I bought this phone for my home office. It is so hard to find a cordless phone with caller ID and a speakerphone without having to buy one with an answering machine also. So, I was glad to find this one. I am sorry to say that it has not been satisfactory. The speakerphone works fine, but when I use the handset, it sounds ""tinny"" and the voices are muffled, even after changing channels. The people I am talking to say I sound garbled and they can hardly hear me, which is the same probem I have talking to others. I have also tried it with a headset, with no success. I called Coby and was told to mail it back with $6.00 and they will repair or replace it, so I will try that."
2,"English dubbed, poor-picture-quality 4:3 video transfer / alternate release","Unless you want this film as English-dubbed version only, I suppose you better avoid THIS particular release (picture quality: 5/10; 4:3 full frame video transfer).Instead you might want to check out this fairly good version - released by reknown French ""René Chateau"" label, available from amazon.it or -.de:Film: 8/10Picture quality: 8,5/10 (46"" screen with upscaling)Aspect ratio:-4:3 Letterbox-16:9 WindowboxRun time (PAL 50 Hz): 1 47'05""Audio: FST: -RC 2; 1??Chapt.: 1 (= NO chaptering!)ASIN: B001Q8UOPGStudio: René ChateauCast incl. Maria Schneider, Robert Vaughn, Sydne Rome, Nadja Tiller, Vic Morrow, Georg Marischka etc."
2,Interesting curio undone by poor video quality,"The late 70s and early 80s saw a lot of international co-productions like this one, and as nondescript as the plot may be, the bizarre combination of talent on display should make this worth checking out. The cast includes Maria ""Last Tango In Paris"" Schneider, Vic ""Combat"" Morrow, Robert ""The Man From UNCLE"" Vaughn. Carlo Ponti produced. Francis ""Love Story"" Lai wrote ths score. And Rene Clement, whose credits range from the classic ""Purple Noon"" to ""Rider On The Rain"", directed. Unfortunately, the streaming version doesn't look too hot, but at least it's not the black-and-white TV version that was once released to DVD."
3,"SLOPPY EDITING, POOR ENDING WEAKEN WYRMSKULL","Wyrmskull does a great job of creating the NPC's for the adventure, but after that it becomes a DM's quagmire. Sloppy editing has many entries repeating exactly the same information you read one column ago, eating up valuable adventuring space. In the final pages, where the PC's explore an underwater dungeon, most of the ""rooms"" are simply bank, with a DM's note to fill in as needed. It has a feel of ""better get this thing out and work on 3rd edition"", unfinished and untested. Overall the plot is decent, the adventure is playable, but this could have been tightened up into a better module, or trimmed down to become a good Dungeon Magazine adventure."
5,JOHNNY WINTER THE RETURN OF JOHNNY GUITAR IS RED HOT!,"Culled from Johnny's 3 '80s Alligator albums (Guitar Slinger-Serious Business-Third Degree) these 13 tracks prove that after the guitar slingers CBS years he still had the fire to burn the fingerboard! Back by top notch Chicago blues players and the occassional guest's Dr. John & Tommy Shannon (ex Stevie Ray Vaughan bassist)during his Alligator years, these recordings show Johnny at his best with no confetti or studio razzle dazzle. These raw to the bone blues tracks boil red hot. If you don't own any of the guitar legends Alligator albums, you must get this one! A must for all lovers of Johnny's music & blues music. Long live Johnny Guitar! A+"
3,"One of the better books in the ""New Vanguard Series""","The book can bee seen as a first read if you want to start learning specificly about the PzIII. Unfortunantley it's a few pages to thin while it gives a good desctiption of the PzIII's operational history on different fronts, the description of the vehicle itself isn't satisfactory. Usually only 1 variant of the tank is mentioned in any great detail unfortunantley these variants vary troughout the book so that it's hard to get a full picture of the PzIII.On the plus side the book is quite easy to read and has alot of new pictures. It also describes a few not so well known facts about the PzIII and it's cutt away look at the PzIII is quite nice.Overall description is that if youre an expert on PzIII's there are better books to buy but if you are going to buy your first book on the PzIII and don't know much about tanks this book will be quite helpful."
5,I don't know who liked this more my nine year old nephew or his mother!!!,My nine year old nephew is very mature for his age and is normally bored out of his mind unless he is playing a video game. I gave him this book and it really surprised him to find a book that he actually likes better than a video game. He is getting really good at drawing and has gotten his mother interested in it as well. They have since bought more books from this author and I encourage you to do the same.
2,OK,"What can I say? This was for my daughter a few years back. Spongebob rocks, but this is OK. Word."
3,There are worse ways to spend 3 bucks,"I have to say that I actually enjoyed this film after renting it out of shear morbid curiosity. The movie had decent acting (better from the spanish speaking cast), the special effects were gruesome enough to make me winch at times, and the story was paced in a way that kept me willing to continue watching.If you have 3 dollars you don't mind spending on a B-list (cause that's what this obviously is) horror film I would check it out. You might be surprised.p.s. I haven't the slightest idea what makes this a ""special edition"""
3,Great,My grandmother and mother swear by this stuff and I've been using it since I started wearing makeup. works great for taking off my false eyelashes.
5,LUCKY to have found this cream!!,"I was sick of paying a lot of money for expensive skin care products. I picked up the large jar of Ponds and decided to give it a try- my skin looks absolutely fabulous (I'm 30 yrs old) and has a dewey sheen to it. My skin looks better than when I use more expensive lotions and I only have to use a very little bit. I encourage anyone to try this cream. It's a great, great buy!"
3,As much as it hurts me to do this...,"I can only give this disk 3 stars. The series, which became my guilty addiction, ended so abruptly, and so unconvincingly. And is it really over? What about all the characters I have come to know and love? (Where is the movie? They made one in Japan...although I heard it wasn't too good)I don't really want to say too much, to give out any spoilers. But what I guess it comes down to is this...if you are a Boys over Flowers fan, you will definitely want to watch the anime conclusion. And if you haven't started reading the manga yet, this disc may just give you the jump start you needed...so the ending won't be so abrupt (I'm assuming...as of now, they have only released 15 volumes out of the 36 Japanese volume series)"
3,Not as good as the manga,"Although the last episodes of the anime are very good, it seems to abrupt and I never thought it would end this way. In the manga, the ending is just around volume 18 of the manga and there are a complete of 36 volumes. So, the ending is very different from the manga and I think that the ending left you in question of ""is that it?"" while the manga, gives the time you need to see how the two main characters fell in love and the ending is so much more better. Its so much more wholesome and didnt leave you hanging. Of course, the animation is lovely although the storyline turned from the manga and seems a bit weird. But it's good never the less, just read the manga though if your a big fan of HYD."
2,Buy the MANGA Instead!,"This anime is mediocre. Animation is poorly drawn. Adaptation from manga to anime poor. Anime is totally watered down and ""Kiddiefied"". The way the story ends is lame.I own the Manga and the live action television series of Boys Over Flowers. They are SUPERIOR to this Anime adaptation. I LOVE the Manga, the storytelling is touching and humorous. The live action series of Boys Over Flowers is equally spellbinding."
5,Excellent shoes,"These shoes are extremely comfortable and didn't require any break-in period. They're light, stylish, and have great traction for hitting the trails. I didn't have any issues ordering my normal size, unlike some of the other reviewers. For reference, I wear a mens 11.5.UPDATE: I'd like to mention that the treads on these shoes come detached from the foam really easily. This is because instead of just having one big rubber piece for the treads, they're a bunch of small triangular pieces. It's hard to describe, but I had to get shoe goo and glue like 4 of them back on the other day because they were flapping around. Unacceptable for what should be a durable trail running shoe."
4,Great Shoe...,"I had never heard of this brand before purchasing this shoe, therefore I was a little apprehensive. However, I was really surprised at the comfort of the shoe when I put it on. It grips the ground extremely well and the yellow color completely pops. I would definitely recommend this shoe."
4,Nice shoe for price,I just started jogging and so far no complaints on this shoe. The packaging was excellent.
3,For WORD lovers only.,"Enjoyed how the typed ransom style words were scattered on the page to add to the illustrations. As a teacher, I can think of many games to play during english period while incorporating this book. There is also a dictionary on the last two pages explaining a few of the big words, which I myself had to use. I appreciated Selig's passion for words and like Selig, can't wait to find the next fun word to use in my stories or in conversation. The book is very wordy itself, sometimes confusing and not suitable for young children.This book should come with word fridge magnets!"
3,Enrich and embellish,"As a school librarian, I have certain shticks that I utilize as the occasions arise. Today as a group of fourth graders burst, vaulted, ran, stormed and catapulted into the library where I was subbing, I deployed my standard entreaty to ""amble, saunter, meander, mosey, roam, walk, dally, wander, perambulate, drift, or stroll but PLEASE do NOT run!""Roni Schotter echoes my own affection for lovely words in The Boy Who Loved Words. Giselle Potter's illustrations have an whimsical Chagall-like quality as the boy decorates a tree with his favorite words. The book includes an abundance, a profusion, a plethora, and a heap of language that will expand, enlarge, embellish and enrich the word choices of all readers."
3,Great gun!,"My dad uses this when he goes roofing, and he says that this is great! I've watched him use our old screw gun and new un reduces the rate or time used on the same job by half! Also good for getting the dog off the couch if you don't use any screws."
4,Superb clutch!,"The Milwaukee's superb clutch is one reason for buying this tool! The clutch operates very crisply; there is a momentary disengagement sound followed by complete silence from the clutch mechanism. By contrast, the clutch on my friend's DeWalt makes annoying noises (and vibrations) for as long as you have the motor on. Other good points: MADE IN THE USA, detachable power cord, handling, balance and position/location of the controls. Cons: 1) the unit arrived with lubrication leaking from the area where the motor is attached to the gears. This soiled the carry case and it continued for a couple of days before it eventually stopped. (I suspect that either a) it was over-lubricated or b) a seal broke and all of the lube leaked out.) 2) The rubber used for the detachable power cord is of the type that dirt, saw dust, etc. sticks to. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and can whole-heartedly recommend this tool."
3,"Not bad, not great","I've always enjoyed the Nest Jesus videos, so when my six year old begged for this one I agreed. It's OK, but could be better. I guess it left both her and I with more questions than answers about the man it is supposed to be about. I also didn't like the scene where they show two soldiers shooting each other...could've done without that in this movie obviously aimed at very young children. My daughter watched it twice in the first two days we had it and has completely forgotten about it since then...just get it from your public library."
3,Average book,Provides forms to copy and use or a way to get them on disk. Would be better to just include a CD in the book jacket. Probably set up to get you mailing address for future spam.
5,Does it's job,"If you don't mind the ticking, this is a great alarm clock to have on hand if your electric goes out. I use this all the time because where I live our electric goes out without warning and quite frequently. I just wish Big Ben or Baby Ben would make a more durable clock. I do replace these every few years.......even though replacement occurs, I continue to purchase this brand as it's one that I grew up with and ""a few years"" tells me it's pretty dependable."
2,Not Acurate,"Buy this map if you are not going to stray from the beaten path, however if you are then dont buy it! I have been to Laos on a couple of occasions, and luckily I didnt use this map! I would have been lost otherwise. Not detailed enough regarding villages, I certainly wouldnt use it as a travel map. Maybe a general reference map, but thats about all."
2,Too sweet,"I bought this item because my sister recommended the Lemon Drop version and also because Cosmos are my favorite cocktail. Although these mixes are quick and easy, this one was way too sweet. Making one from scratch may be alot of work, but it's well worth it!"
3,"Hot hot hot, but...",Penelope Cruz is so hot that anything she is in practically burns a hole in the projector screen. That said this is kind of a mediocre movie for her. She does a great job no doubt about that but her role / character is oddly boring and I found I wasn't able to watch the movie all the way to the end.
3,not bad,"it should be not bad for its low price. If it is not so easy to be scratched on the dial, it will be much much better."
2,This watch should not be used as a watch,"The watch looks bold, and feels strong. But it lacks the fundamental characteristic of a timer, the accuracy. So I returned it after 2 days."
5,My dog loves it,"Probably, the best thing about this toy - no matter how my dog tries to break it, it's still alive."
2,chicken,The product was a pinkish color. It did not match what I saw online. When I got the order it was crushed inside of the package and therefore ruin the shape.
3,A MOVIE TO SEE!,"I found this movie very gory.And it had some great scary scenes. I don't know why,but i still needed KEITH SOUTHERLAND to make me really feel this picture.The new night security guards,i just did not feel like keith delivered in MIRRORS 1.I still think it's a must watch movie.AND A GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT!"
3,Is What It Looks Like,"I like dumb horror movies, and this, for a dumb movie, is decent! The first one is better, but I'm glad I downloaded this startle-fest."
4,Good,"..I sure do miss Keifer Sutherland- its not the same without him...but, this movie is good without him (I guess) :)"
2,Blah...Blah...,The story line is old nothing like the first movie. Nick Stahl is a good actor in a bad flick.
3,My first disappointment with Cambridge,"I normaly rave about Cambridge Bible quality, but this is the first one I bought that disappointed me. The Bible came to me and right out of the box, I noticed that underneath the back covers along the flaps was BLACK TAPE that looked like the leather binding. It OBVIOUSLY was holding a broken binding together!!!!! I could not believe it!!! Otherwise, the leather, pages, and everything else is wonderful. Maybe Cambridge decided to ""rescue"" this bible by taping it up and selling it anyway since it is among their ""least"" expensive bibles. I have never had even a Nelson or Zondervan arrive with TAPE in the back. Amazing!!!"
5,TRF wa sugoi!,I have been a TRF fan for a long time. They have crossed many music genres and they always rock. If you are into JPOP then you must check out TRF.
2,Rifle Pistol Shooting - Winning with the mental edge,"For the novice who is just getting started in competition shooting, this book will provide the basic knowledge. It's written in the simplest form and crudely attempts to outline what is actually a very complex subject. For an individual who is above the novice level of competition I would not recommend this book."
1,Twelve and One Half Key,"I am very sad! I paid $45 for a new book ($10 book), and received a used copy. I sent an e-mail to address listed and received an e-mail back stating basically that my e-mail would take forever to be answered, to respond to the web page. I had tried to respond to the web page four or five time but it was down. I now have replied to the web page - we'll see if I get a response.I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who had lost his book. I understand it is out of print and makes the value of existing ""new"" books inflated...I bit the bullet on that - but don't insult me by sending me a used book.It will be interesting to see if I get a response to something. A company can send addition material, but not answer e-mails!THE BOOK IS A WONDERFUL BOOK!Thank you for listening.Rhonda Lomonaco"
3,Great Book for Northern Exposure Fans,"I found this book from another book seller. I was so excited to see and read about all the stars and see some special behind-the-scenes activities that you only dream about. Pictures are only in black and white, but the information is great although not enough personal stuff about each star, everything said was very filtered. I also bought the book of photos taken by Rob Morrow and they were all black and white and not much of any information at all about the series and people us NX'ers cherish. Still I am a push over for anything ""Northern Exposure"". I suggest you keep looking and you will find the book somewhere. A must for any TRUE NX'er!"
1,Northern Exposure: The Official Publication of the Television Series,"Save your money on this one! The interviews and writing have the grit of a high school freshman attempting his first article for the school newspaper. The author does not even spell K-BHR right, he continually spells it K-BEAR. Spend your money on the musically emsculated DVD's for more fulfilling entertainment. After you have read this book, your insight into the people that create the special characters of Cicely remain without substance.I would not spend more than $3.00 on this book."
2,"great show, so-so book","In the book's defense, I guess it doesn't claim to be anything more than what it is - a standard puff piece on a TV show - but NX was anything but standard. The writing really set the show apart and there's only one (brief) interview with two of the show's writers (there's a bit more with the creators, but not much of that, either). It's mostly made up of interviews with the stars on their reactions to fame, etc.Anyone interested NX would be much better off with Ellis Weiner's fictional 'Letters from Cicely', which really does capture some of the flavor of the show."
1,REJECT,"Fails to provide a good set of character roles to play, especially for women. Also lacks for scenerios. Supporting information also lacking.Complete disapointment. Needs more research and better development."
4,Another wonderful Irvine Welsh novel.,"Trainspotting got you depressed? Read Ecstasy. In the world of Irvine Welsh, the last story is a veritable ray of sunshine. :)"
4,fast food fun,"This book is a great Mc-read, full of gaudy flavour, crude but compelling. It's no more a masterpiece than a double cheeseburger is haute cuisine, but it's no less satisfying for that. The structure of the book works very well. I love the play on the cut-up technique: first the chopped up fragments of cliched romantic fiction, then the literally torn minds and chopped bodies of the second story. Finally, the 'overwhelming ecstasy' of shared feeling bringing two people in different worlds together. Always, though, Welsh balanced the drunken, drugged moments of ecstatic joy, against the inescapable and banal facts of life and love. The dim-witted, vicious thug of the second story - duped into self-destructive love - is nicely contrasted with the amiable dope-head of the third, constantly mistaken for a notorious child-molester with a similar name. Humm. Maybe I was wrong: not a double cheeseburger, more like a really well-cooked curry - spicy and subtle at the same time."
2,Three novellas - one drug,"I am a big fan of Irvine Welsh so I was anxious to get my hands on ECSTASY: THREE TALES OF CHEMICAL ROMANCE. Sadly, I was left disappointed. The premise of each novella as described on the back of the book is excellent, but Welsh's execution was very poor. For example, in the first story, ""Lorraine Goes to Livingston"", Welsh was not consistent in his use of Scottish dialect for the main character which was more than distracting. Also, the idea of a mortuary worker having free sex with the corpses in full knowledge of everyone in the hospital is a little too far fetched, even for Irvine Welsh. I will not bother to continue with the shortcomings of the other two stories.Although I was disappointed in ECSTASY, I will not give up on Welsh as I still believe he has an amazing talent."
5,WHY?,"This book evokes the true nature of man. It explores every side of human nature, through delightful characters and a MASSIVE storyline."
3,Memories of the Underground Cafe,"Although one of the more specialist topics in a Welsh novel, Ecstasy reads far more easily than his other works. Admitadely some may find this topic and the whole clubbing scene hard to fathom, but Welsh's ability to structure the novel around three totally different sets of people (and indeed users) makes for interesting material.From frustrated women to angry young men Welsh covers all bases with this one. But unfortunately I found the stories a bit stale and lifeless to really draw me in with any major empathy or character development. But then I thought to my self, that's what Welsh does, and doesn't he do it well! three stars, possibly four if it was written by someone we don't expect so much of."
2,A step backwards for Welsh,"It is hard to believe that this book was written by the same man who was able to come up with the ideas, characters, plots and extremely interessting scenarios for ""Trainspotting"" and ""Marabou Stork Nightmares"". ""Ecstasy"" consists of 3 different stories, the first story is somewhat controversial (typical Welsh) with the whole idea of necrophilia, and has a humerous ending with an ironic twist. The second story should have been written into an entire novel. The characters weren't developed enough. The story did have an extremely funny part involving the whole ""Melon"" situation however. The third, final and longest story was boring and uninteressting. So I give this book one star for its mildly amusing parts, and one star for a cool cover, but is an absolute joke compared to his other work. I got the impression that ""Irvine"" rushed through this one, especially considering every chapter was only one or two pages."
3,Not a bad piece by our friend Mr. Welsh.,"A rather bizarre and sometimes funny novel. The first of the three tales is hilarious. Welsh makes a sick and perverse behaviour seem funny. The second story hit a serious matter that should be more widely exposed in the media and should be recognized as a serious historical mistake. That way, perhaps we will learn from our ""profit only"" driven motives. Obviously we haven't learned yet. The third, however, drags on a bit. Somewhat entertaining, but the it takes to long for anything to happen. Additionally, Lloyd is too much of an older Mark Renton. Don't be discouraged, it's worth reading."
2,I hate short stories,"Although each story in this book is around 75 pages in lengh, they are not long enough to enjoy. Really only for completests."
3,falls apart,"I was excited to read some of Welsh after seeing ""Trainspotting"", and I was disappointed with ""ecstasy"". The book conists of three stories, arranged in descending order of worth. The first story is good, the second is so-so, and I couldn't even finish the third.""Ecstasy"" is worth picking up for the first two stories, but just skip the third. The third story is especially disappointing because the first two stories show off all the potential of Welsh's writing and the characters just permeate wierd.<P"
2,ugh.,"first of all, look at the cover for this book.that's about as enertaining as things are going to get. this book is ""trainspotting"" in condensed form and welsh at his most pretentious."
3,modern romance,Irvine Welsh takes the readers creature comforts and beats him or her over the head with them.This book is divided into three short stories about chemical romance:Lorraine Goes To Livingston - this story was just bizarreFortune Always Hiding - a tender story about backwards love andThe Undefeated - my favourite out of them all with a surprising ending.Irvine Welsh delivers romance with urgency in this fast read.
1,Must Try Harder,"The feeling you get from reading this book is of a cop-out. Of an attempt to cash in on the stellar success of the 'Trainspotting' movie no doubt.'Ecstacy' consists merely of three lazy, half-arsed 'ideas' that would struggle to get into the far superior 'Acid House' collection of short stories. Irvine obviously didn't know how to tell his publisher to wait a few months until he could come up with a proper book. Fortunately the follow up to this ,'Filth', finds him back on form so perhaps this book should be seen as a 'mere blip in an otherwise upwards trajectory'. As Sick-boy almost once said."
2,Ecstacy is anything but.,"When I read ""Trainspotting"", by all accounts a much stronger book, I was struck by the flatness of Welsh's prose when not smothered in Scottish dialect. ""Ecstacy"" is not written in dialect. The book consists of three novellas, which are arranged in descending order of quality. The first kept me reading, the second wore out its welcome before it was over; I didn't finish the third. ""Ecstacy"" underscores Welsh's weaknesses as a writer, sporting flat dialogue and a strained narrative voice. But the cover is pretty and the book looks nice lying on your coffee table, so die-hard Welsh fans won't go home completely empty-handed."
4,Okay for what I use them for,"I'm not a push-up maniac. I don't drop and knock out sets of push-ups in bunches (although once upon a time I did). So, I don't need the utmost in top quality. That being said, I feel that these are pretty good for my needs. The bars are lighter than I expected but still feel sturdy enough for my workouts. The two-piece plastic top and bottom pieces come apart. I haven't had any problems with them separating during use. So far, I've used them on carpeted surfaces only. They work fine on carpet with no rollover or tipping so far while doing wide and normal push-ups. The cushioning is light but I haven't experienced any pressure-related aches or pains. I don't know about those who do hundreds of push-ups on end but I will definitely tire first before feeling any pain from lengthy sessions. For the money, not a bad set of push-up bars."
3,OK - gets the job done,"These are plastic, so I wonder how well they'll hold up over the long run. That being said they are light weight and easy to move around. They are comfortable, but could have use a little more padding. The anti-slip pads on the bottom are just too small to be effective. After a few usages they start slipping - a little more stuff down here would be appreciated."
3,Okay...,"I wouldn't call these things amazing, but they work. They slip on our hardwood floor and seem a bit flimsy. We will see how they do over time..."
3,Okay for those who want a inexpensive plastic pair of light padded pushup bars,"I find the Harbinger Padded Handle Push Up Bars to be okay. While they are plastic, and I'd prefer a ""sturdier"" pair, they work okay. I've done a variety of pushups with them, and they work for what they are intended for. Nothing special or great about them, but nothing really bad either. I don't think they are as ""cheap"" as some reviewers make them out to be. As I said, they are made of plastic, and the ""padding"" isn't that much. But they were comfortable enough. But then, I'm not too hard to please when it comes to comfort having trained in dungeons at times. :-)If you want to vary your pushups with a set of push up bars or handles, these are okay and get the job done. They are the only bars I have, because I normally do pushups without any aids, and have found pushups to be a great exercise all by themselves. They are okay for those who want a inexpensive plastic pair of light padded pushup bars."
4,Makes A Useful Addition To A Home Gym.,"These padded handle pushup stands are, as advertised, designed to avoid wrist strain for users. Although plainly made on the cheap, they are compact and attractive, in case company comes by! The large gripping area is furnished wuth padding that seems to be durable and the stands are easily disassembled for inclusion in a gym or AWOL bag. They are just as easy to reassemble. My use of them has been upon carpeted surfaces; the rubber and hard plastic bottoms might not be quite so effective upon wood or other flooring. The ""delta"" shaped base does indeed increase stability, as the manufacturer promises. A broad range of pushup type movements, including reverse pushups, can be performed correctly with these reasonably priced stands. Recommended!"
1,"Flimsy, poorly designed and constructed.","I was hoping to like these Harbinger Padded Handle Push-Up Bars, but they're so cheap and flimsy that I cannot recommend them and most likely won't be using them again. I also own the Perfect Pushup V2 bars and have used those for over 6 months without a problem. The Perfect Pushup V2 are well built, stable and comfortable. These Harbinger bars are overly lightweight, poorly manufactured and unstable. Not a combination you want to have when the safety of your wrists is at stake. I suppose for somebody who is lightweight and doesn't work out too often these might suffice, but for a big guy like me who likes to work out every day, these just don't cut it. In the end, I cannot recommend these. If you're looking for decent push-up bars, spending a little more on higher quality is worth it."
2,Not needed,"I don't see much benefit to these bars. Push-ups felt similar strain wise without these. They were strong enough and didn't seem to slip or anything, but I only used them a few times as they didn't provide me any benfit."
2,Surprisingly flimsy,"The concept of padded push-up bars is excellent but the execution of the product is not well-done with these bars. They are surprisingly cheap in quality and unless you use them with extreme care, on the ideal surface, they really aren't that reliable. I think this is a clear case of ""you get what you pay for"". I would invest in quadruple the money for sturdier push-up bars."
3,"Alright, but nothing special and sort of cheap.","While these may come in a nice box that claims it is the next big thing, these are simply plastic handles. Yes, they may be nicer to hold onto than doing push-ups on the floor, but they are nothing special and have function. What you see is what you get.The plastic also feels a little cheap. I don't mean to exaggerate, but part of me was expecting the plastic to crack under my 150lb weight.If you are going to spend money on push-up handles, spend the extra few dollars on the nice ones that spin."
4,Good Product,"These are good push up bars. They are a little lighter weight than I expected them to be, but I can't imagine them breaking under my weight either. I weigh 190lbs. I'm not sure They'd be as good for someone over 220lbs. They are a good way for someone to get a little more motivated to do some exercise as the prospect of doing pushups can be daunting for someone who has fallen out of shape. The name of the product is ""Harbinger."" Does that mean that they are harbingers (messengers) of fitter times? I hope so."
1,Please try to stay away from these!!!!!,I bought these to give me greater range of motion on pushups. While they work alrite for normal pushups they are an absolute failure on almost any other type of pushup modification. Using it for wide stance you risk breaking your wrists because the flimsy design easily causes them to roll over. Close grip pushups lead to the same result. The plastic material is extremely flimsy and the handle itself seems like it can break at any time.Though i havent tested them the tko bars seem better because they seem to have more balance. DOn't be fooled and lured in by the price because these handles aren't worth it. I've completely stopped using them and they are laying around as a useless piece of junk.
2,Stressed my wrists,"I do a lot of push-ups so I thought these bars would be good to use as preventative maintenance for my wrists. Unfortunately, straight out of the box and few push-ups later, I could tell they were doing the opposite. I felt more pressure and stress on my wrists instead of less. Other people seem to be getting good results with these bars and I don't doubt their claims to be true, but these were definitely not for me."
2,Limited Functionality,"The Harbinger Padded Handle Push-Up Bars provide the ability to extend your range of motion when performing traditional style push-ups but are not stable with wide push-ups.Pros:+ Economical+ Extra range of motion with traditional push-upsCons:-Limited functionality in that it works best with only one style of push-ups-Dangerous when using for wide push-ups and can possibly roll causing a significant wrist injury-Made from cheap plastic material and does not appear to be durable or sturdy-Padded grips provide limited comfort-Slip on our hardwood and tile floorIf you only do traditional style push-ups the Harbinger Padded Handle Push-Up Bars will probably fit your needs although I am hesitant that they would last for a long time with consistent use due to durability issues.Overall, I would not recommend this product as it has limited functionality, is not comfortable, and is cheaply constructed."
2,Careful,"When these originally arrived I thought they looked good. However opening the box my first impression was that1) this plastic is flimsy2) There is not suction or grip.For regular push-ups I've not had a problem. However as I wrote the plastic is flimsy and for a big person (I weigh a little over 200 lbs give or take) I question if they would hold.If you do jerky push-ups (up down fast) you could lift the bars right off the ground, I did.The sponge grip does feel nice. But my wrists feel it more than regular push-ups.Reverse push-ups I did not care for them at all. I almost rolled a few times as the bars did not grip the ground well and I was on my side holding the bar.The only good thing I can say is for someone who travels, wants to do push-ups in their room and not get your hands dirty.Other than that I would be very careful with these."
5,They work for me.,"I am a strong believer in the old saying ""you get what you pay for."" With this set of Harbinger Padded Handle Push Up Bars, I guess that old saying is not always accurate. I have owned and have used quite a number of different sets and brands of this particular training aide, some of them I have paid well over fifty dollars for. These Harbingers, which I paid the original price, work just as well, if not better than the more expensive models, bar none. The padded handles make them a delight to use. They are sturdy, give you full motion for your push-up and that extra extension that is so important. Please keep in mind that I am a woman, small with small hands. They fit and work for me perfectly. I have no idea how they would work for a larger man with larger hands and more weight. I will say that I can do a lot of reps (well over 100) with no problems but feel if I were quite large, they may not work as well or be as comfortable. This may be something you want to consider."
3,"Decent, but room for improvement","Good for average, everyday regular pushups. Not so good if you are trying more advanced movements or styles. My main complaint is the foam grips on the top will start slipping during mid-movement of the pushups which can cause problems. Also, the rubber stoppers on the bottom for stability fall out easily, if you lose them these will slip and slide all over the place. At that point I would rather recommend the old school palms down style over the Harbinger's anyday. I recommend the ""Perfect Pushup"" rotating brand over these anyday, spend the little extra money for a better quality pair."
3,The foam handles slip too easily,"These bars do help alleviate joint pain when doing pushups, but the foam grip that you see in the picture is a loose covering and slip much too easily when doing pushups. You get what you pay for.My suggestion, pay double the price, and you should get something with a little more quality."
3,"Cheap Quality, But Good Enough","For the price, these are a good product. If you're looking for an item that will last you many years, you may want to keep looking, as I doubt these will do the trick."
1,Very Cheap - Low Quality,"I was excited to see the great price, and was hoping to see a halfway descent product. Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up. I regret this purchase and will be returning for a refund."
5,Make pushups easier on the wrist,These pushup pads keep your wrist inline with your arm and help you to (1) do a deeper pushup and (2) relieve stress on your wrist while doing pushups. These are nice and sturdy too.
3,Does the job.,"I bought this product for P90X. It does the job, but I wish they were not plastic and were made of metal. I am only 140 lbs I don't know if they would hold up for a 200 plus individual. They work for me and I have no need to replace them. They also could be a bit heavier."
4,"Great product, great value","I've had these push-up bars for well over a year now. I bought them for the P90X workout, as a less expensive alternative to their advertised push-up bars.The extra range of motion provided definitely allows you to work your muscles more. The design is also compact, durable, and light weight, so storage is no problem. (Especially compared to some of the larger bars I've seen.) The foam grips add some extra comfort too.My only complaint is that you must be conscious of your hand positions and body motion when you're doing very wide push-ups. Because the base is narrow, the bars can accidentally roll over in your hands. Be sure to test how wide you can comfortably and safely position the bars before doing wider push-ups."
4,saves your wrists,"These are really great, if doing pushups hurts your wrists. I think you will see more results from your work out also."
3,You get what you pay for,"Like the title says, you get what you pay for here. You will receive two padded handle push-up bars and off the first glance I thought they looked sturdy and reliable, but once my boyfriend tried them out clearly they weren't what I thought. He had a hard time keeping the bars still as they were too light and his wrists seemed to move around more than we would like. The more he used it the less sliding they were doing, but overall it didn't look like he was getting the full effect of the push up. Being this light makes it easier to hurt your wrists and especially if you're a heavier person."
5,Helps for push-ups as well as for yoga,"I have weak wrist joints and find it hard to do push ups and hold certain yoga poses with my wrists bent and palms flat against the floor. These padded bars make all sorts of activities possible for me that I was unable to do before. These are nice and light weight, too, so I can easily reach for them while moving from one yoga pose into another."
4,They do what they are supposed to.,"I can't say that I have any complaints about them. I picked them up about 1/2 way through my 90 days of P90x and I have to admit they do making doing pushups easier and allows you to go deeper. I may pick up a larger set for the next round, but wouldn't have any issues about buying another set of these if I needed them."
5,Great value,I bought these to go with the P90X that I ordered. THeyre great. I've been using them for about 6 weeks and I think they were definitely a real value over the more expensive ones. I'm already gettng great results
3,Perhaps just a bit too small,"I really like these push-up bars overall. They are light and sturdy. Still, they are really narrow and have a bit of a tendancy to slide on hard surfaces. Not a big deal if you have an excercise room or work out on wood floors. If you work out on tile, however, consider something with more surface area and traction."
5,M Davis,"Works great, they feel more secure than the metal tube type bars, light weight easy to put in travel bag."
5,No hassle photo description..!,I receive my shipment 2 days before the ship date. Great style and padded for minimal punishment to hands. Awesome product i recommend on closed eyes. No money wasted.
1,Cheap,"Terrible design, when I purchased this item I thought it was a good idea but found I got what I payed for. The push up is definitely harder and more concentrated in a area but they slide on hard wood floors or any surface which makes it hard to do a set. All it needs is some type of grips on the bottom. Still use but not reccomended"
1,Cheap Plastic,They felt like they would break when I used them. Ended up buying a sturdier pair (Power Stands from P90X that 100x better) after using these twice.
2,Returned - too much horizontal slip,"These work fine for standard and narrow width pushups, but don't really work for a wider stance since they slip outwards."
2,The Harbinger Push-Up Bars,"I purchased the Harbinger Push Up Bars from Amazon. I like the style and the fact that they are low to the ground and have very comfortable grips. However, the bars are made of plastic and are not as sturdy as they appear in the photo. As for usability, they are fine for doing normal range push-ups. However, when I attempted to do wide range push ups there was entirely too much strain on my wrist joints. I may end up purchasing a sturdier rotating set in the near future."
2,"comfortable, but not completely stable","Good price, and saves yours wrists from the painful angle of a normal pushup. This version seems to want to tip over when you go wide with your pushups."
4,good push-up product,i weighed around 185lbs and have used the push-up bars for about a month.it does let you go down further and transferred the stress from the wrist to the palm. the bar does provide stability against the floor and have fairly comfortable grip when doing push-ups. i have no problem with it so far...
4,Work as advertised,I ordered these as I have tendinitis in my wrist and wanted to try and take some of the pressure off when I do push-ups. So far I have used the bars probably 15 or 20 times and thus far they seem to be working pretty well.
2,Drill with no reostat.,If I had known this drill wasn't a variable speed model I would never have bought it. It's very hard to use any drill with only one speed.
5,A Great Drill,"I picked up this drill at home depot based on a review of corded high amp 1/2 inch drills in tools of the trade magazine. It has features and power that leave the competition in the dust.It can spin a mixing paddle in a bucket of drywall mud, handle a 2and 9/16ths self feed bit and drive lag screws all day long. The dewalt couldnt nor could the porter cable."
5,The very best,"After trying many andouille sausages, Aidells is the very best (and they make other good sausage also). I've stopped wasting my time, money and taste buds trying to find better."
3,Well......,"This tape contains basic virtues introduced in the book. Virtues that are stimulating and thought provoking, but leaves much to be desired by it's short length. I would recommend investing in the 4 cassette set in order to indulge in to more than a preface of Hubbard's ideas."
1,Oven Liner,I was disappointed in the quality of this product. My element in my oven burned right through the liner after using the oven a few times. I have never broiled in my oven so the liner should have been able to deal with a temperature of 350 to 400 degrees.
1,"NOT as pictured, does not fit a standard oven.","Item NOT as shown, which is what I wanted. Instead of receiving the tan colored oven liner I received what looked like a piece of black trash bag. It is long and skinny, no way big enough for an oven. I'm not even sure if I cut it in half and tried to overlap it that it would fit a standard oven. The best I can do is cut it, and put part of it in my counter top oven. It is not as thick as the one I had seen at someone's house, as I said, it looks like a piece of a black trash bag. So now I have to search again for what I wanted and order from someone else."
3,Thaughts,I really thought that this product would be thicked and made out of silicone. Material is no easy to cut to fit in. It is very easy to make a mistake and cut it to the wrong size.
1,Don't waste your money,"We used this once in the oven at a temp of 425 for an hour. It kind of melted on to the oven and it totally ruined. We had another brand from Carol Wright in our second oven that works great. I was just trying to save some $$, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Non stick oven liner,"This oven liner became discolored after a period of time. Doesn't perform as well as the others I've used in the past. It does the job though, but may not last as long as a more expensive one."
2,Not pleased,"When this item arrived, I was sure there must have been some mistake. It was poorly packaged, having been rolled then bent to fit in the box. As I removed the flimsy material, I first thought that maybe this was a protective backing for the actual liner and that the seller had left out the actual liner! But, no. The flimsy parchment-paper like material IS the liner. The way it was packaged is keeping it from staying flat in the bottom of the oven. I'm still debating whether I will bother to lay heavy books on it to try and straighten it out or fool with trying to return the thing."
1,Warning!,"I purchased this after carbon monoxide detectors were installed in my house. Every time I used my oven,the detectors would sound the alarm...only when I used my oven with this product inside.I removed it and viola...no more alarms! Be careful!"
1,not worth the money,I purchased this item with full intent to use it in the bottom of my oven...to help make cleaning up easier....My oven has not been obove 350 degrees the past month... the liner has melted into the bottom of the oven and has put off a fowl smelling odor every time the oven is turned on...this was a brand new stove...so we were assuming it had to burn off alittle...then would be ok..after a month it still was putting off a fowl smell...and would burn your eyes if you opened the oven door! we have removed the liner...and it is gone...this liner is not worth the money I paid for it and would not recommend anyone purchasing this iten in the future!!!
1,Burns - not durable,I purchased this hopping it would help keep my new oven clean. Placed it on bottom of oven and it caught fire and left a horrible stain on the bottom of my new oven. I could cry. If you purchase it don't use over 400 degrees.
1,Rennie,"This is without a doubt the worst excuse for an oven liner that I've ever seen, it's like tissue paper."
1,Terrible product,"This oven liner was anything but what it claimed to be. The liner infact stuck onto the bottom of my stove and made quite the mess. Never again,,....This sticking thing I had never incountered before and because of this piece of trash will never buy again."
4,Un used as yet,Have not used it yet but have great expectations! of this product.Anything would be an imporvment over trying to keep my oven clean
3,OK for the price,This product works as described and I would have given it a higher rating but it simply doesn't last very long. I'm already seeing clear signs of wear on it and believe I'll need a new one fairly soon.
2,Too thin for me,"Very flimsy material. It feels like it would have come out of a roll, like waxed paper. I wonder how long it will last with my cooking."
3,"Oven liner is black, not beige as shown","The non-stick oven liners that I received were black and very thin. I kept them, since my old liners really needed replacing. It's hard to see spills and crumbs on the black liners. Time will tell as to whether they last very long. We bake a lot, so we'll know soon."
3,thinner than expected,I recently purchased this item hoping that it was similar to one I had purchased from another supplier a few years ago. I was a little disappointed at how thin this liner was! Spills still wipe off easily but I am afraid it may not hold up as well as the thicker one did.
3,non stick liner,"It took forever to get this, I was disapointed with that. and then when I reseached it they said I ordered it when I was suppose to recieve it so wasn't too happy but the product is good"
2,Disappointing...,"I purchased this product hoping it would be good for long term use. Problem is, the minute any oil, grease or drippings fall on it, it is permanently stained. I have scrubbed and rubbed and can't remove the stains.That means you either have stains on your oven bottom that comes off with cleaning and easy on a self cleaning oven or you have to keep replacing this costly piece of liner. If you choose to not clean it, it is a large eye sore every time you open the oven door. You're shamed into doing something with it.I think I'm throwing it away with all the stains and just self clean the oven bottom when necessary."
4,One of his best,"The title Glasnost Bizarro has absolutely nothing to do with the contents of this yet another collection of Dan Piraro's one-picture-jokes - it's just another sign of his strange humor... and it refers to a joke on the cover (front AND back) of the book...Which IS one of his better collections, although not reaching the level of his earliest work!Still, Piraro's Bizarro is in the class of Gary Larson, so if you don't know him, you definitely have to give it a shot."
5,Great chapter book for kids of any age,When I was 8 or 9 in the mid '70s I checked this book out of the library repeatedly. It's about a little boy whose older brother's Little League team winds up drafting the little boy to play in some championship series. So much fun. I'm here on amazon to find a copy for my little boy.
4,"Works, but not cheap","Installed easily into a 2002 Mac ""Quicksilver"".It came well packaged.Wasn't the cheapest, but it has a well known (to me) name that has never let me down before."
2,Looks nice-if you have a girl's wrist size,"The design looks nice, but the title ""tough guy"" is a little misleading. I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for my brother, but the band would not go all the way around his wrist. It fit his skinny girlfriend all right, however. We also had to use the pliers on one of the snaps because a piece of metal stuck out in the way of the snap so that it didn't close properly. The name should be changed to tough-girl's band."
4,Huge container,I love these vitamins for my daughter. I wasn't expecting the jar to be so huge but I'm glad. They'll last a while. I don't care much for the smell of them though but the taste is great.
5,My kids LOVE these vitamins!!,My kids love these gummy vitamins. The won't take other vitamins. Very hard to find otherwise. I'm glad I found them on Amazon!
4,Round Midnight. . . with a twist. . .,"Every once in a while you run into a rare gem. This collaboration between Ray Brown and Laurindo Almeida is exactly that. While Thelonius Monk's ""Round Midnight"" has been covered by countless groups, this version really captures the loneliness. . . the almost oppressive silence that accompanies that moment. . . emotionally a ""10"".The playing is honest, unpolished, and raw at times. It's as though you're in the room as they are discovering musical kindred spirits, and starting to dance together for the first time.Moving, spiritual, and a wonderful snapshot of another of Ray Brown's fabulous collaborations for which he'd become so well known for in the later years of his life."
1,Bad Program!,"Downloaded the trial version and installed it on a high-end ACER Core-2-Quad, 4 gigs RAM, 512MB video card, etc. I have lots of software installed and this is the first program, on this computer, that failed to work properly.After installation and dumping my photo files into it, it never could do all the thumbnails for my photos, maybe 70% of them, the rest never filled-in. Then while trying to simply execute a thumbnail, the entire program froze.Restarted computer, same problem again. I uninstalled it immediately. I wouldn't even consider using this program if it were ""Freeware."" And it ain't Freeware!Another winner from Microsoft! Highly recommend that you do not even waste your time downloading the trial version. Look at Adobe Lightroom."
2,Amazon sends opened software,"I purchased iView MediaPro 3 from Amazon and found the first shipment had been opened, and probably used..I called to report this and Amazon said to return it.I sent it back to find the next shipment to be also previously opened.I finally gave up and just used the software anyway.I does Not work in Intel based Macs.It does work on my old G4."
1,Eats up INK...DON'T BUY IT,"BewareI had a very bad experience with Canon printers. I have called their tech support to explain why my printer was using up all the color inks, when in fact I was printing documents that were in black and white. Apparently they designed the printer so it uses all the color inks to make the black color, very smart haaa. This way they force you to go buy color inks that run up to $60 to $70. Why??? I should be able to select weather I want to print in color or black. They couldn't explain why, in fact I am responsible for using the printer and so I am at fault. I love Canon camera's and Camcorders, but never again I buy a Canon printer. Tech support gets very poor rating."
1,a disappointment in one way,"It's a beautiful machine, other folks have had very good luck with it. I purchased it with high hopes. Unfortunately, on only the second use, the paper guide jammed and became unusable.This can happen, I know, with any complicated device. I was just on the verge of ordering refill inks (which are very expensive, incidentally)."
2,Works poorly with linux,"I was disappointed that the printer does not work properly with linux, which is my primary work platform. I ended up giving it to my daughter to use with her MS windows."
4,One Feature Left Out,"This product only earns a four star rating from me due to one thing which was left out. The ability to print directly to a CD/DVD disc. This is a very important option, which is found only on Canon printers marketed in Europe.Why not in the USA? Yes there are other manufacturers who also sell printers with this feature, but thus far none match the quality of Canon printers."
1,Short Life of Ink Tanks,The ink cartridges in the PIXMA MP950 dry out in a few weeks whether or not I print any pages. This makes the ongoing cost of running this printer very high.
1,This book is not very useful.,"This book is an over-detailed look at a pig-headed man who likes to think he went head to head with Carlos Lehder, one of the most dangerous men in the Medellin cocaine cartel. Passages that try to create the impression of the ""hero's"" bravery only highlight his lack of meaningful contribution. Lehder operated a ""Dr. No"" style island in the Bahamas, which could have made for a fascinating book, which makes the book even more disappointing. Better info on Lehder is in ""Blow"" and ""Kings of Cocaine.&quot"
4,I lived in the Islands during this time; this book is true,"I lived in the Bahamas for 8 years and traveled to Normans Cay several times and explored the island after Carlos Laeder left. After I read the book I went there two more times and looked through the ""Ruins"" that his group left and could almost relive the book. Although the island paradise that he built at the club has been devestated, the rest of the island has been slowly retaken by new inhabitants. I believe that Mr. Novac told a very true story and I only wish that I hadn't given away my hardback copy of the book. I would like to buy two copies again."
5,Would make a great movie!,"Awesome especially after visiting the island. Many of the remnants referenced in book still there. Carlos home ""Volcano"", the club and the airport that funneled all the drugs into US."
3,A Moving Coming of Age Story,"The Romance Reader gives a glimpse into the hasidic world that was fascinating to me. As a coming of age story it works very well. I did find myself wishing that Abraham had taken a few more risks, that she had added a little more texture and layer to the world she describes. Other books in this vein that I enjoyed are The Ladies Auxilary by Tova Mirvis and The Mind Body Problem by Rebecca Goldstein --both of these also give fascinating glimpses into the Orthodox Jewish World with a great deal of depth and humor."
4,Coming of age within the Hasidic Jewish culture,"This memorable book tells the story of Rachel, and what it's like to come of age within the confines of an ultraconservative Jewish sect. She is surrounded by mainstream America, she is required to follow the strict rules of a culture dating from the Jewish ghettos of 18th century Poland. Rachel wants to fit into the streets of New York kids of the 60s, a desire that nearly makes her rabbi father, dutiful mother, and indeed her entire community, come undone with shock. To readers, Rachel sneaking into the public library to read classical literature is endearing; to her family, it's akin to sacrilege."
1,I'm hasidic,"Being one of the hassidim, I must say that I had no joy reading this book. It hurted ""me"" because I know most of the characters in the so called novel. I know that she never felt the love of the religion, might be because there is no good book to explain the love of it. This is something which is supposed to go from parents to their children, and many times ""they"" arn't the good messengers for many reasons - which one was probably the cause here, too. - reading thru the book I was looking for a cause; I thought of many, but I came to the conclusion that she skipped a lot of information.Her situation as described wasn't so exceptional from others I advised, and guess what they married and are so happy, fitting into a novel named The Romance finder. A Hassidic Councler"
2,"Unusual perspective, but trite coming-of-age novel..","After perusing some of the other reviews as well as thinking over this book, I find I have more reason to give it only two stars. ""The Romance Reader"" attempts to show us the closed world of the Chasid, but it really is a delayed screed against the Orthodox traditions of Judaism, as well as a fairly dull coming-of-age novel that reads very juvenilly. Now, the novel follows Rachel Benjamin, who we know is much like the author, who at the start of the novel is at bat mitsvah age(12), and she is starting to question her parent's traditions. She grows into a fairly modern Jew, who loathes matchmaking and loves the ways of the ""Goyishe"". The father is a hopeless dreamer, a rebbe without a following, who is constanly put down by his wife, who does a very drastic thing at about page 100. As ohter reviews have said, Abraham uses some of the real names for fictional situtations which is a big no-no."
4,A Window into Rebellion,"Enjoyed the book, very much. The beginning was slow, but it held my interest and opened the door to what it feels like to be part of a situation (her family) against one's thoughts. Actually, having thoughts and a mind in this scenario is what the problems is. As women are treated as non-people in these sects. Creatures to be led by men who live in the 19th Century. This world of marrying at a very young age, with little education and bearing upmteen children, is such a negative for women. Very provoking. A good read."
2,Incongruous,"I am a Yeshiva educated reader who rebelled and left Judaism so I identified with the protagonist, but the character made no sense to me. She is portrayed as being so ignorant of the traditions and lifestyle of her own family that she didn't realize what taboos she was breaking or why her parents were so angry at her. I find this quite bizarre. I didn't expect her to be learned, but she should certainly have been more savvy about her culture with the upbringing that she had, and she should have been cleverer about her rebellion."
1,A whine fest,"I am not orthodox, though I am Jewish, and I usually love books that show me glimpses of the orthodox community--but not this one. All anyone did in this book was complain! Poor me, my life isn't the way I want it to be. Now that's fine for setting up a character--but not for a whole book! I really didn't care what happened to Rachel--I just wanted her to shut up and grow up."
3,Not what I'd hoped for...,"I wasn't so impressed with this one. I had higher expectations. I usually LOVE books about religion, particularly the Jewish religion. I'm fascinated by religion, and was hoping for more of an inside look into the Hasidic culture and way of life. The whole book was about Rachel struggling and doing everything she could to disobey her father. It seemed as though she didn't even care. And I didn't really learn anything new about the Hassidic way of life. I expected a lot more, and frankly, Rachel bored me. I was disappointed in the ending."
4,Couldn't put it down,A fascinating glimpse into the world of Orthodox Jews and a bittersweet coming of age story. I read it in one day and thought about the charactors for days afterwards. I highly recommend this book.
4,"Educational, inspiring and well-written.","Read this book to learn about the clandestine Chasidic community and the villages they create within American towns and cities. This book is a wonderful study on how a traditional, tightly bound community can survive and prosper while rejecting the modern world. By following Rachel through her struggles, one realizes the inevitability of forceful indoctrinization of the younger generations in order to assure the continuance of such a community. As a young woman with a free will and a strong spirit who chooses to challenge her family and the small ""world"" in which they live, Rachel is a true inspiration"
1,One star because the drop-down menu wouldn't let me give it any less!,"This book was so bad, I actually threw it out after I finished it. While that's sacreligious to me, I was just so annoyed that I had wasted my time with this tripe! The characters are not redeeming in any way. The person you were supposed to identify with was (to me) a selfish, annoying brat who wound up doing something really hurtful. While this was supposed to be an act of her liberation, it made me feel worse for the ""victim"" than the supposed heroine. If you want good, Jewish chick-lit fiction, pick up ""Jane Austen in Boca""!"
1,I'm surprised I finished,"I have to admit that this book was a gift and that is probably the real reason I finished reading it. The writing wasn't bad -- for fifth grade level. However, there is way too much talk and too many fantasies about sex for a fifth grader. And her opportunity too ""escape her marriage"" was too convenient. I don't recommend this book at all."
2,The Voyage to Nowhere,"Beginning as a promising voyage into the land of Hasidism, The Romance Reader fails to make good on its promises. Told in a writing style that is reminiscient of popular women's fiction, the first person narrator gives the reader glimpses of a world filled with two dimensional characters lacking any depth.The Romance Reader does, however, entertain its audience members even if it fails to move them to any specific emotional responses. Simply put, it tells the story of Rachel, a young girl struggling to break free of the ties that bind her (similar to Naomi Ragen's Jephte's Daughter but without Ms. Ragen's depth of character). Just when the reader reaches the pinnacle point in Rachel's life, hoping against hope for catharsis, he is again disappointed.If you are looking for easy, leisurely reading on the plane or bus, then you may want to pick up a copy of this novel at the library. However, if you seek fiction in the truest sense of the word, you need to search elsewhere"
4,An Elegant Sufficiency,"This film is about as crisp as they come -- simple story, focused writing, bold charaters, and vanilla cinemtaography. Basically, this is the archetypal British film, complete with a brilliant (and I use that word purposefully) monologue delivered by Michael Redgrave in the finale. You will react to his monologue at home as if you were sitting in the pews 50 years ago -- it's that sublime. If Carole Reed ever made a film about the education system -- this would be it. (8/10)"
5,Buy It!,"This is Jeff's best album to date. Simply stated, you can't go wrong buying this wonderful CD."
2,Gives a basic understanding,"I found this book to very informative. Knowing nothing about osteopathic medicine before reading it, I learned many of the basic concepts and theories. The book gave me an understanding of the development of medicine and how osteopathic medicine was developed. The stories about A.T. Still and other early physicians as well as the interactive theory explanation were helpful in understanding the development of this field. I thought the book could have more detail and be written better but overall it was worth reading if you want to learn about osteopathic medicine."
1,Good for ensomniacs,"I'm not sure what the author is trying to say in this book, or as far as that goes, what audience he is trying to reach with it.It's difficult to take the book seriously when you see the dorky looking guy with the smiling snake on a stick on the dust cover. ""A Unified Field Theory for Healthcare""? - get real. Just one look at the cover makes a person wonder where this guy is coming from. It's a real slap in the face to the osteopathic profession. Being written by the president of the founding school of osteopathic medicine, I would have expected something much more profound.If you suffer from ensomnia,the price you pay for ""Your Healer Within"" will be the cheapest drug you'll ever spend money on to put you to sleep."
1,Like a Medevil Torture Chamber!,"I nearly lost my will to live as I suffered through this book. I would not wish McGovern's literature upon my worst of enemies! If you think the ridiculous picture on the cover is bad, let me warn you that it's all downhill from there! I don't know what to do with the book now. I can't sell it to someone else without knowing that I stole their money. I can't even burn the book for fear that the fumes from such useless drivel would cause me brain damage. All in all I think my rating of one star is far too generous, but there was no option to rate it a 0.00000000001 stars. If you really want to buy a book, try something more useful like James Harriot's books."
2,"A bit arrogant, thin on brain science","I bought this along with J. Austin's Zen and the Brain. This was the thinner book so I finished it first. Farily simple read. However, I found it rather arrogant with respect to other life and approaches to spirtuality. It is also very thin on any real brain science. Basically one man's interpretation of pop psych and zen. I found little in it to recommend to others. Austin's book has much more science and background, but is a *very* thick read."
4,Loved it!,My kids loved it. They weren't bored. Animation was great. I only wish it could have been longer to fit everything in it. But for my younger children it was perfect.
4,arch,I am a preschool teacher and got this for my kids. With all the pieces it was way too hard for them. But I wood glued the base and four layers of wall. This left the arch for them to build. For my five and six year olds they were able to do it and loved using it.
5,Excellent advice for busy professionals wanting to relocate.,Country Bound! can help people define their dreams. I recommend it to all professionals who truly want to take control of their lives.
3,"Kiss, Psycho Circus rocks","This is a great album by all original members of Kiss. Granted, some of the songs are wanting, ""You Wanted the Best,"" but others deliver the goods, ""I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll"" and the title cut for instance."
5,Wibbly Pig is Wonderful!,"This book tells a very simple story about Wibbly Pig. Wibbly pig happily builds a sand castle then eats an ice cream. He is surprised by a wave and loses his ice cream. This leads Wibbly to be upset, but he is soon cheered up by a dog and is happy once more! The text is very basic (i.e. ""Wibbly Pig is busy""). However, this book promotes conversation between parent and child because the parent can discuss what is happening in the picture. The illustrations are sweet and Wibbly is adorable! This board book is larger than most which make it easy for little hands to explore. I think this book is probably best for infants up to 3 years. This book is fun to read and my baby loves it!"
3,love the idea ..but hate ...,"the weak bits...the cutter are excellent, but the bits break easy. I replaced them with some irwins and use the cutter and the quick change ...good but just beware the drill bits"
3,Will NOT fit in an impact driver,"I was very excited to use this when I first received it in the mail only to realize the stem does not fit in an impact driver. This surprised me, because most drills are getting away from the standard chuck. So I use it with my DeWalt hammer drill and bought a Makita Quad Driver that has all the same features and fits in a standard impact driver chuck. DeWalt should have known better. Everything else they make is awesome."
5,A great little must-have for the poker buff,"Following in the footsteps of ADD-type books such as ""Schott's Original Miscellany"" and the ""Bathroom Reader"" comes this fun poker compendium. Coming in at about 6"" tall with 200 pages, The Poker Aficiando contains an assortment of informative nuggets covering pretty much everything poker: strategy, rules, odds, percentages, history, lingo, tips, anecdotes, and trivia. Most of the strategy-related material is provided by Phil Gordon, John Vorhaus, and Robert Williamson.As the author states, a lot of the material comes from outside sources, so you may already be familiar with some of what this book has to offer. But having such a wide array of info in one pocket-sized collection makes this perfect for the novice and intermediate player, and it's a great time-killer. However, it's likely that you'll cover the bulk of it rather quickly, so here's hoping it won't be long until they come out with a second volume in the near future."
3,nice gift book,"The size and feel of this book make for a nice gift. An inexpensive gift for someone you know who has a love for poker. As far as the book itself-I doubt I will ever spend more than five or ten minutes browsing it. It is very much a poker ""trivia"" book. Cute as a gift and for very light reading. Not much substance for diehard poker fans and actually a letdown after his ""Winning Secrets of Poker"" which I think very highly of."
4,99% better,product rate is more compare to other brandbut if we compare to wondfo it is really good..i recomond this product...
2,"Ovulation tests good, Pregnancy tests BAD!","I purchased these and was very satisfied with the ovulation tests, however the pregnancy tests were very unreliable. At 5DPO I was getting faint positives and amazed because it was so early!! However the tests never got darker over the days and always tested negative with a First Response test. Even today, I got a faint positive then looked down only to notice I started my period.It was so confusing and heart wrenching to get the joy of the faint line only to have it be false.I WOULD recommend the ovulation tests and WOULD NOT recommend the pregnancy tests."
2,Not as reliable as I thought,I bought these to try a new brand and I'm not very fond of them. I've been using them with another brand and comparing the 2 different OPK tests and the line on these is hard to see and very faint when I've used other tests that show a much darker line. I've never used the HPTs that came with them.
2,"Great price, but hard to read","I would recommend the ClearBlue digital ovulation predictors over these. These are a great price, but found them hard to read at times. With ClearBlue, you get a smiley face for ovulation and a circle for not ovulating. VERY easy to use and worth the price."
5,Cheap and Accurate,This product is reasonable price and easy to use. I would recommend any woman who wants to get conceived to use this product.
5,Great Product!,These strips live up to they hype. They are cheap so you can use as many as you need without feeling guilty. They are easy to use and the strips are very accurate. I found these strips to be more accurate than the drug store brand.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP & CHEATING ITEM,"When I received this item, I was shocked!!! The manufacture cut a regular size stip into half - That's how they make profit. What you get is a tiny thin strip. I can't believe they do this. So this ""so-called"" Combo pack of 40 strips is actually only 20 ""normal"" ones. For everyone reading this post, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS DISGUESTINGLY CHEAP ITEM FROM A CHEAP SELLER!"
1,There is a reason they are so cheap!,"I purchased this kit in hopes that it would help me to be able to predict ovulation. They didnt. At the same time, I was using another test which showed the surge. These sticks did not. The same thing happened with the pregnancy tests. I used them for 10 days and got nothing. Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no! I would not rely on these for much. Sure the cost is okay, but when the result is nothing, there is no reward. For peace of mind, especially if you have been trying to concieve for a long time, choose a name brand you can trust."
1,no positive result!,"I was thrilled with the price, and had no problems with the online instructions. However, I had two cycles where my temperatures suggested I was ovulating, but the test was negative - the color of the test line wasn't even close to dark. I switched back to the name-brand ovulation kits this month and compared the positive from that side-by-side with this strip, and this still read as negative."
3,"Inexpensive, but need a back up","These are super-cheap and allow me to test as often as I want without feeling guilty. The only problem I have is that I am never 100% sure if the test is positive. The lines don't show up as solidly as some of the more expensive brands, so you have to look for the darkest part of the test line to compare it to the darkest part of the control line (usually the left 1/4 of the line for me). I keep some digital OPKs to use when I think I have a positive with these strips. The two together seem to work great!"
5,works great,"This product does what it claims to do. The instructions are online and it's easy to read, easy to follow."
3,Inconvenient,"The price for the tests is great. However they do not come with instructions and each time I needed to use them I had to go onto their website. Very, very inconvenient!"
3,Charger didn't work,"I bought this set because it was cheaper than buying the items seperate. The case and ear piece worked great, but the charger didn't work in my car. It wouldn't charge my phone at all...but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"It any pretty, but mine works","When I attach the car charger to my phone it does manage to charge my phone, but it doesn't light up the indicator light or make the on-screen charging infromation appear. My phone has yet to explode, so I guess it works and safely, but I have no way of knowing other then when the battery bar moves up a notch after charging for a while if it's hooked up correctly or not. This hasn't been a problem, but more of annoyance.The headset works like a charm. I don't use the case, but it seemed as promised. Not a stellar performance, but it will charge your phone in a pinch (I constantly forget to charge mine) and keep your hands free."
4,The Sacred Embrace of Jesus and Mary,"I haven't read this book yet, just glanced through it and I know I'll really enjoy it."
2,"A Canadian book, and not a strong one.","The book includes some basic and general good-writing advice, but it is not a strong text. Too many weaknesses.First, there are too many long, block quotations from judicial opinions, and too little accompanying analysis of what was good or bad--specifically--in the quoted text.Second, the subject of judicial humor doesn't justify 14 pages of treatment. Perhaps one page to amplify on this statement: ""Use it rarely, if ever, and then only toward yourself."" The examples in that chapter are odd--almost none are humorous, nor does it seem that they were intended to be.Third, the book uses the words ""decision,"" ""opinion,"" and ""judgment"" in less-than-careful ways, sometimes interchangeably and often confusingly. Not good in a book on judicial writing."
2,Not-So Rugged...,"This item served me well for about 1 year, then simply stopped working. It is not recognized by anything I plug it into, and the black around the cute little graphics band is not durable and rubbed off withing six months. Has been on my key-chain and not subjected to any unnatural wear and tear, water immersion, or anything of the sort. Save your money and buy something more durable!"
4,Better This Go-Round,"As I reported about the show's first half of season one, ""The City"" never could replace ""The Hills"" in its hey day but with the addition of new cast member, Roxy Olin, to cause new drama, the show finally found its light beyond the shadows of its predecessor."
3,Spiritual thinking taken to dramatic heights,"Being acquainted with the editors, I chose to read the introduction and afterword as book-ends. The effect was electrifying, since these writers clearly are wrestling with their personal beliefs, and struggling to communicate how important this quest can be. Any tolerant and thoughtfull religious thinker will find his/her accepted theology stretched and challenged, though many of the views seem ""heretical"" to mainstream conventional approaches. Take a chance and see if some of your long-held tenets don't take on a different resonance."
3,"Essays are very outdated, but she's still a talented writer","Even though the topics are extremely out of date -- Helen Gurley Brown at the height of Cosmopolitan, Bill Blass, Mike Nichols while he is filming Catch-22, and Ephron herself is still on her first husband and hasn't met Carl Bernstein yet, she's still enjoyable to read."
2,review of Wallflower at the Orgy,I am a Nora Ephron fan but this book was not what I expected and I did not care for it.
2,Pathetic,"This has to be the absolute worst manual for any piece of software. As the book works well as a basic tutorial, the index is extremely lacking. There is no parts index. Only the extremely basic is illustrated in this manual. I hope anyone using Pspice for the first time can find a better book than this."
4,"Rocky start, good finish","I have been using mine for about 3 years in my router table. The first one I received failed after the first days use. It took a few weeks for a Warranty replacment to arrive.I agree with all the top reviews for this router. I have cut molding to raised panels in all types of hard and soft wood, It does a great job. My only wish is that you could make fine adjustments from above the table.I gave 4 stars for the failed fist unit, but it has worked fine ever since."
4,Best Plunger for a Router Table,"This is an excellent plunge router with a single exception, the plunge release lever is very difficult to operate with your left thumb, I simply cannot push the lever down far enough to fully disengage the plunge lock without shifting my natural grip on the handle. Other than that, the plunge is smooth, the router feels comfortable in my hands with a minimum of vibration. I was surprised by the lightness and balance of such a powerful router.The mechanism used to defeat the plunge spring works flawlessly and is very easy to both engage and disengage if you read the instructions carefully. This feature is what sold me on the router in the first place, as it will spend most of its time in the router table. No need to buy a ... router lift accessory with this machine! It came with a fine adjust extension and can be easily micro-adjusted while under the table. I was also delighted to find a dust pick-up attachment in the package, I did not expect that!"
4,Full of power & features,"This is a very powerful router that will handle most any project. I would like to have a light on a router of this class, but I plan to use it as a table router most of the time. I had planned to use this router on my Craftsman router table extension on my table saw, but the mounting holes did not match. I should have checked that out before buying. Now I will need to purchase or make a router table."
1,Bosch low Quality,"I started by ordering the Hitachi... it was broken upon arrival, so sent it back. It was inexpensive, so I thought I got what I paid for!Stepped up tho the Bosch, top quality, or so I thought. Expensive, no accessories included, but that's ok! It had great reviews. After a couple hours of use in 2 months, I have a router with 1/16 inches of shaft end play!!! I'm going to try to get it warrantied... but in the mean time guess I'll order a Dewalt."
2,Bosch router problems,"This router was highly rated, but it was not what it was stated to perform. We returned it once as a part was loose in box. The second one, we also returned & got a refund. All processes was handled in a timely & efficient manner."
5,FIRST RATE TOOL,"Anyone hanging more than 20 sheets of drywall at a time should consider this tool. Battery operated drill/drivers are not meant to produce speed in installation.Checked others in stores and for the money paid on Amazon, this was the top gun."
4,screw gun,The gun is great but the bit driver is not the right one for this model.Overal is a good buy.
4,the latest from hecht,"Hecht's verse is always a pleasure to read. You see his intelligence, formal skill, and love of language in his poems. ""Nocturne"" is Hecht's succesful villanelle, which is one of my favorite formal types of poems, and when it is well done, and it is well done here, it can be one of the most successful forms of poetry. bravo mr. hecht. ""Sacrifice"" also sticks out in the book. it is a poem in three parts, juxtaposing the story of abraham and isaac with an incident in 1945, which is just chilling. hecht has several successful translations. I was dissapointed in the lack of war poems, which few do better than hecht, and the overabundance of religous poems. the dual picture on the cover lead me to believe that the subject of this collection would be both wwii and religion. i would hope next time knopf would do better in designing the cover."
5,Let the crazyness begin,First episodes startes from Tomari veiw just before she walks in on Yasuna and Hazumu at the end of the last disk. One afternoon when Yasuna and Hazumu are togther they realize they do not know that much about each other. In a attempt to get to know Hazumu better Yasuna invites all her friends to the beach. When she talks to Tomari she finds how she has feelings for Hazumu also.When the aliens get Hazumu and her friends to do a hunted house you can see how both girls are not sure what they should do. Ayuki seems to have feelings for someone but who? When they decide to go to yakuta kimono festival togther Tomari is shocked to hear her request. By the end of the festvial yasuma and Tomari make a agreement to not make Hazumu make a choice after they happen to find out what happened at the last festival that Hazumu did not want to rember.Do not forget this is a english subtital series but I feel it is worth it.
2,I like the effort but it's not what I expected,You can find all this basic information on herbs for free online.There are no real healing techniques it just covers the basics of herbs.I like the effort but it just didn't get pulled off in this DVD.There are probably alot better books out there for the same price of this DVD with more detailed information.
3,Native Healing Celebrated,"After centuries of colonialist suppression, more Americans are beginning to realize that Native health practices may be effective. This documentary never says one method is better than another; it celebrates having choices.The documentary interviews Natives and whites, women and men. Still, most of the Native healers shown were female and I wonder if that is a part of tribal tradition, a bit like how midwifery was traditionally done by women in Euro-America. This film celebrates the ways of Asians, Africans, and the indigenous people of Latin America, thus it promote person-of-color unity. One man spoke in front of a herd of docile buffalo. If I were part of a species that was almost wiped out by humans, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near them. Why did they have to be hunted if they are as passive as they are in this work?This documentary was a bit short. It would be great for New Age advocates or science classes with mostly Native students to see."
2,A horrible bore that could be condensed to a pamphlet,"I'm currently trying to battle through reading this book for my Business Ethics class at AJU. For one, the main meat of the book is only about 250-300 pages, the rest are case studies. The case studies are interesting and thought provoking; the actual text is very lacking in substance. I'm a compulsive highlighter, and in many quality textbooks I highlight 25% of a page of actually useful information--this textbook I find maybe one line every other page that is worthy of noting. The rest is garbage. I'm finding the Stakeholder & Issues Management Approach itself could be explained in a few concise pages. This book could really use more interesting concepts, or be replaced with more case studies."
3,Scientific tome......,"WITCH HAZELS (Hamamelis) make good alternatives to Forsythia. These shrubs and small trees bloom in early spring, can be found in many colors and will stand up to relatively adverse conditions. Chris Lane has written a relatively scientific tome with sections on breeding, hybridizing and cultivation and a small section of color photos, but no associated illustrations with each Hamamelis types listed (you have to flip back and forth between the photos and the write-up). This book may not prove useful for beginners who prefer a picture of the plant and lengthy description. ""Hands-on"" experienced gardeners who can read will probably find almost everything they need to develop an interest in Hamamelis."
4,Solid piece of gear,Solid foot pedal with sturdy construction and durable buttons. No noise that I can tell. Requires a battery and it was hard to get the battery lid off. I wound up taking off the entire bottom plate to change the battery. Other than that this is a good purchase at a good price.
4,Have you bought into corporate hegemony?,"Why do we work? Neala Schleuning explores the traditional reasons why we work and how today's workplace meets those reasons. The answers are disturbing. She discusses corporate hegemony which overshadows the rest of our culture. Our society is focused on making money for corporations and for ourselves. Our community focus has been reduced or even lost. Her recommendations are focused on redefining our thinking about how we make money and how we think about our economy. She also discusses how we might alter our consuming habits to have a more environmental responsible world. You will agree with parts of the book and disagree with the other parts, but you will think along the line. You probably will think about how you would like to shape your work and life"
3,Fastways' Bad Bad Girls,"This release is certainly their weakest. That being said, this disc has its' bright spots. The tracks ""I've Had Enough"", ""Bad Bad Girls"", ""Cut Loose"" and ""All Shook Up"" are quite good. The rest of the disc is just filler. This disc is recommended for completeists only."
1,"Bad, Bad Music","This sounds alot like On Target. If there were a country called Mediocre, then Bad, Bad Girls would be their national anthem.Lots of boring, boring songs, with mediocre vocals, mediocre guitar, and drums that sound like a drum machine.If you buy this don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Reciprocating Saws - Wish List,"As I review the features of the Makita corded riprocating saw, I see the necessary power of a plugged-in tool. This is not one of the tools that can afford to run out of power as cordless tools often do at a crucial point in their use. The quick change (without tools) of the blade for a sharper, coarser or finer blade is very satisfying for working unencumbered or away fromthe tool's own tool box. Variable speeds are important because in the beginning of a cut, the precise place that the saw begins that cut determines where the cut will saw through. I use a reciprocating saw to dismantle old barns, getting the precious barn wood off without damage. Nails sawn through release the wood without damage and make the tedious job of un-siding so much quicker that I offer this tip to everyone. /s/ Alan D. Johns"
4,Helpful and motivational,Knowing what to do is only half of the problem; doing it is the other half. I carry Mayer's book frequently for the motivation I need to rein in my random/abstract approach to tasks and materials. Just re-reading my highlighted sections helps me get back on track. The book's small size belies the great content.
2,good tool to get you started,"This book was a good tool to get you started toward an organized office. There are many tips to help anyone manage their files (I like the idea of a master file closest to your desk) and to keep on track with projects (using the Master List). I was disappointed that this book was published in 1991 and hasn't been updated. There are tons of computer tools that make the chapters on calendars, appointments, even the hand-written Master List obsolete. I do appreciate the ideas this book presented and will use them with the tools on my computer."
3,"Keep your desk clean, make a to-do list.","Keep your desk clean, make a to-do list. I just saved you the money, time and energy needed to read this book."
2,It would be great for slow readers.,"In my opinion the book, The Weirdo, wasn't very exciting due to the fact that it was very slow moving. The reason I quote this is because one thing would happen and then four chapters later something else would finally happen. For example, you would find out that Samantha Sanders, the main character would talk long walks, but you wouldn't find out until later why she took them. Finally, after about the tenth chapter things started to move a little quicker. The book in my opinion on a level of one to ten would receive a five. This book I would recomend to readers who like slow and boring books."
5,The weirdo,"The book was well writen, a little slow reading at first but over all pretty good. Even if i was not made to read it i problably would've read it anyways. But if you have a choice what to read, read a book that also has cliff notes too, it helps if you want to fully understand the book."
2,"Boring, pointless, confusing and predictable","This book is an insult to teenagers everywhere. For one thing, the sentence structure is poor, using too many commas, just so the sentences can be stretched out, longer and longer, melting the brain of whoever reads them, to the point of sending the reader, screaming, yelling, from the room. For another thing, it doesn't draw to a satisfying close. I was waiting for Theodore Taylor to say WHY the guy kills Alvin, but he never does. The story is almost too predictable, making it blatantly obvious who is the murderer early on. Sam and Chip are the only characters who are even remotely interesting.The Weirdo becomes confusing in the middle, when it jumps around with almost no indication of where it is.Please, do not waste your time on this awful book."
1,the weirdo summary,"the book is so boring i fall alseep in english class when we read it, and remember 2 words on the last paragraph, so when ihear my name, i know where to start, this book is way to slow, way to boring, i dont even get it at all, if you have test on it, say i dont like this book, to hard, to boring, to slow, to compicated, and i just dont like it"
1,You'll regret it!!,"I personally would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like humongous challenges. I got very confused while reading this book for multiple reasons. One being that the author jumps around so for example he's setting up the plot of the story and then jumps to seven years later. This next comment is in a way connected to what I just said but, right when something gets interesting he changes the subject. Another reason is because you have to read 150 pages into the book before things start to make sense. The last reason is that the author leaves a lot of unknown questions at the end."
3,The Weirdo,"Avon Books Inc., 1991, 221 pg., $5.99ISBN 0-380-72017-5The WeirdoBy: Theodore TaylorHave you ever met someone who is so weird that you actually gave him the nickname, ""The Weirdo""? There is a teenager, Chip Clewt, who lives near the swamp and doesn't come out in public. He has terrible scars on his face from a plane crash when he was young. For these reasons, the people of the town call him ""The Weirdo."" Samantha, a girl in the town, finds a body in swamp near her home and is positive ""The Weirdo"" must have killed him. Sam gets lost in the swamp chasing after a dog, and ends up at the Clewt's house. She meets Chip, ""The Weirdo"", and realizes that he couldn't have killed the man she found in the swamp. If not Chip, then who? Together, they set out to find the killer.I was enticed from the first scene; I loved it. Theodore Taylor made me feel I was on the hunt with them. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense."
1,The Werido,"I must say that I was not forced to read The Weirdo. I also must say that I will never pick it up again. The book is about these two teenagers, Sam and Chip, who are defending themsleves for the bears. The beginning was ok, but then in the middle the book kept switching off from Chip to Sam and it got really boring. The one good thing is that Chip learns to stand up for himself about his image, and Sam stands up for herself against her father. Unless you like boring books about bears and someone murdering someone else and then these two idiot teenagers falling in love, then this isn't the book for you. I thought this book was going to be good... I thought wrong. I just hope I get a good grade on the test.Question for anyone who has read the book: where does it take place? like I know its the Powhatan River and in the 1990's, but what state???"
3,Swamp,First of all if you don't like books that go from one time to another time back to it's last time you will not like this book. This book hooks you into it in the beginning the lose's you towards the middle. Once you get to the end after a hundred pages you get right back into it. This book is more of a mystery than a horror. This book has only three scary parts that last a couple of pages. The two main characters in this book are Samantha (Sam) and Chip (Weirdo). They work together to save the bears of the swamp and to find out who killed Alvin Howell who Sam found dead when she was little and who killed Thomas Telford who was Chip's friend and someone who he helped wih the bears.
2,Theodore Taylor could have done better,"The Weirdo was not one of my favorite books I have ever read. I dont think that Theodore Taylor did an outstanding job on this book, but dont get me wrong because Theodore Taylor has alot of great books and I am a big fan of his. Theodore Taylor did alot of jumping around in time on this book and I got a little confused while I was reading. I would not recomend this book. This is totally my opinion, but someone else that reads this book may like it."
2,It ain't Weird,"Reading this novel gives you the feeling like you're watching a made-for-tv-movie, which i only find amusing due to that i symphathize with the lead charachter, who's a burned victim and tries to cope with the societies ostracization and concepts about his appearance - as he lives in the swamp with his father, and took the knack to take the job of monitoring the census for the bear population in their area. Though not to the full extent - i find some great relevant and personal similarities with me about the kid in this book (sic). However, the WEIRDO is a fine piece of novel for young adults; teem it up with Ester Weir's juvenile novel ""THE LONER"" published by Apple books."
3,The Weirdo,"When I saw this book, I thought it might be about some mystery murderer. This is a fiction book about a girl named Samantha who finds a dead body on her way to school and she's trying to find out who murdered him. I liked this book because of what the characters say. I liked this fantastic book. You should definitely read this excellent book."
4,Great 70's women's movie.,An interesting movie that reflects how Hollywood was portraying the changing roles and attitudes of women in the 70's. Fun to see Bo Derek and Anthony Hopkins in the hot tub--total 70's. Shirley MacLaine's excellent.
3,Dry but informative,"This collection of essays addresses economic forecasting.As a non-professional I found it somewhat informative but it suffered from being rather dry. It addressed forecasting from a theoretical point of view but didn't do enough to enliven a subject. There's not enough here to really show the reader how forecasting is really done and how it can be usefully employed. There is also little guidance for the lay person in how to regard forecasts, either as useless guesses to fill newspaper column inches or the time between commercial breaks on CNBC or as useful predictions on the future."
4,Very Cool!,A film different than anything else that I have seen in a while. Very moving and insightful to the darkness of Hollywood.
5,Thank you!,"A classic science fiction novel, Ward Moore's 'Bring the Jubilee' is a page turner. It describes an alternate reality, and also is a morality tale based on the time it was written. The characters are fully fleshed out, and you become emotionally hooked. A powerful, memorable book that you should read as soon as you can!"
5,A Classic Tale of A Confederate Victory,"Written decades before Harry Turtledove's Civil War alternate history novels, Ward Moore's 'Bring the Jubilee' is the story of an America divided. In 1863, the Union loss at Gettysburg paved the way for southern independence and left the United States a backward, third world country. The novel's protaganist, Hodge, leaves his rural home for what he hopes will be a better life in New York City and eventually finds himself in a community of scholars where his final destiny awaits him. The characters, situations and philosiphies of 'Jubilee' remind the reader of another great Science Fiction author, Robert Heinlein. Moore has the same wonderful ability to convey the complex ideas of life and society that make Heinlein's novels so compelling. Also wonderful is Moore's explanations of temporal theory and his understanding and presentation of the Battle of Gettysburg. If you enjoy alternate history then 'Bring the Jubilee' will not disappoint."
3,Interesting? Yes. Masterpiece? No.,"This is an alternate history of a U.S. where the South won the Civil War and the North is its vassal/client-state--which results in the industrial revolution never occurring. Set in the 1930s-50s, the story follows a young boy growing up in rural Pennsylvania who moves to New York (which is still ""the big city"") where he does a little growing up. Unfortunately, too much time is spent in his head, and not enough detailing the alternate world around him. He becomes a autodidact Civil War scholar and eventually is accepted in a sort of academic commune. Moore concentrates a bit too much on showing how things might have been, and pounding the fickleness of history into the reader's head, at the expense of a decent story. It's somewhat interesting to see how the hero develops, but he's kind of frustrating character, and in the end you know what he's going to do. The book is OK, but not as special as it's made out to be."
1,Entertaining Fiction,But not as good as his other book: The Earth is Flat: Recent Scientific Advances Disproving the Hysterical Round World Theory.
5,Interesting Take,"There is a huge amount of information that the author speculates on, but it appears to be well researched. I can't say it's a slam-dunk argument, but it's definitely ""discussable""."
5,Great Sanding Drum!,"Bought this for my father for Christmas. Delivered with plenty of time, works great, this is the only place I would get sanding drums again!"
4,Drum Sanding Kit,I found these drums to be very handy for use in a drill press when sanding odd shaped pieces of wood. Replacement of the sanding tubes is no problem as the size of these drums are standard.
1,Doesn't work... sorry,"Got it, based on the first reviewer, but the stuff doesn't work for ""my carpenter ants"". They just keep coming in and out and cross the sprayed area many times in a day or night. For now, I don't see any better solution but Terro Aerosol."
1,waist of time,"was too hard to put together, my 7 year old lost all interest christmas night. had to take it back beacuse it would not steer straight, would fall apart even without making it go. i do give it a 5 star educational value based on the level of patience and studying of the instructions you have to do"
1,This car is a rip off.,"This car is a waste of money. I built it the first day I got it and I thought it was pretty cool at first but it kept on breaking. It cant turn at all. It also only uses one wheel to drive and has the two fake on it to stabalize it. This means it wobbles a lot. It also doesn't run very well on carpet. Actually, it doesn't really run on any surface that good. Out of all the rc cars I have bought(to many to count)this is the worst of all. Please don't buy this. It is a rip off. It is horrible."
2,Too much gristle and not enough meat,"While there is a lot of philosophy floating around in this book and talk about bird-people stances and what they mean, couple with meaningless promotions and xenocide, this book just never felt like it got on its feet. It was too busy explaining the not terribly interesting parts of a conflict and glossing over things like pacing and character development. It reminded me of a painfully dull episode of Babylon 5, which interestingly enough, this book is compared to on the back cover."
3,Yet Another Space Navy Yarn,"Overly verbose riff on the Royal Space Navy cliche.This is a quick read and has some interesting culture clash points to make, but depends too much on tedious soliliquiesto keep the plot moving. The tech and battle scenes seemed to have been borrowed from the LENSMAN series of EE Doc Smith. Along the way, the author sets himself up a franchaise.It would have been good, if it was 100 pages shorter."
4,Good 'space navy' type novel.,"Although the alien mysticism is a bit odd, it isn't overpowering. Good stuff."
5,A thoughtful tropical action thriller,"This book is a great beach read, wherever... as the other reviewers noted I could not put it down, even got a little sunburn! our strong and resourceful heroine is well portraied, and having spent a bit of time in the Bahams, the book capture better, than any I can remeber the mix of romance, mystery, decay, and appearances that shift like the proverbial beach sands. Above all Mr. Hall knows how to write an action thriller, it struck me that this would make a fun movie! Highly recommended, as are his other books on Amazon. PS apropos the previous reviewer who did not like some of the literary license: lighten up! I am also a fisherman, and eat small barracuda; ciguetera toxin is more common in very large reef fish, better to watch for the amberjack on the menu next time you go to the islands. All in all a delightful read! Hope for more soon."
5,Hall's Third Book is also First Rate!,"Russ Hall is a very fine mystery and adventure writer. Each of his three published books show a skill of invention, style and pace that is different from book to book. Wildcat Did Growl is a thrill ride. The main character is a sort of Bruce Willis (of Die Hard) wrapped in a female body. Plot twists abound, and the sense of place (the Bahamas) is remarkable as well. Hall is very good. Buy his book; it will not disappoint."
2,Bad bits,These bits seem to get hot quickly and then break if you apply the least little bit of lateral pressure while using them. Won't buy them again unless all other bits I find perform the same way.
5,Get the Hard Cover Copy!,"Aside from the incredible practicality and usefulness of this book, it is a collector's item. I recommend purchasing the Hard Cover copy because this is a book you will hold onto for the rest of your life and hopefully past down to your children and they will follow with the tradition. The guides and illustrations are classic! Despite all the information on the internet about fly fishing, I always find myself returning back to this book for an answer."
3,"Nice, but not ""ultimate""","Basically, is a three sections book: General aspects of fly fishing, casting techniques, and fly tying. The three of them are quite good, but I think that an ""ultimate"" guide should include more info on presentation and fishing the different types of flies. In my book, that is a 4 stars book. But, it also happens that there are some discrepancies between the casting basics presented in the first section, and the ones presented at the second section, devoted to casting (for example, the role of the wrist's while casting).I should say, it is a decent book, but has a lot of room for improvement."
3,Good for the beach...,"This is an easy, well-written read...Characters are fairly engaging and the story is interesting...but the story didn't pull me. I found the book easy to put down even though it is nicely written. I think a sense of cliche and a tone that sometimes felt preachy broke my interest; just a touch overdone. But for a novel that doesn't demand too much it does give a lot. It's a novel I would recommend to a friend."
2,"Starts strong, then weakens","I loved the first few chapters of this book. Mid-novel, both the plot and the prose became more mundane and the characters more one-dimensional. To top it off, I hated the ending, especially an inexplicable plot development involving the supernatural(!)."
1,Wha-? Wake me up!,"A man unexpectedly dies, leaving his loved ones to struggle with their grief--a story that has been written probably thousands of times over the years. Assuming the characters are well drawn, this storyline will not bore. But if the characters are a disagreeable, two-dimensional lot, well, the result will be uninspirational. And, ultimately, this book did not inspire me. Rarely do I put aside a book in which I'm over halfway invested, but I made an exception in this case. I just didn't care what would happen."
3,Not for the general reader,"This is a very technical and scholarly interpretation of Homer's epic poem. The commentaries in this book-though insightful-are really for advanced students and scholars rather than the layman. Undergraduate students seeking to learn more about the Odyssey should really consider picking up the Cambridge Companion to Homer rather than this book. It is intended for the general audience and is much less technical.This collection of critical essays is by no means lacking, but its technicality will pose a serious problem for students who are not studying Greek literature and the epic tradition."
2,A jumble of disconnected stuff...,"This book tries to cover slightly different ground than ""how to start using Zope to develop web sites."" If you're looking for a good general introduction to Zope, I'd look at either Beehive's The Book of Zope, or the Zope Book (the online edition at zope.org; the printed version is quite out-of-date).This book is basically a walkthrough of several products for Zope (the CMF, ZPatterns, ZUBB, etc.) I doubt you'll find that you've learned much about how to use Zope or how to develop for it, rather than a thin bit about how to apply these products.I also found that this book felt rather hastily put-together, without much continuity between chapters.The only reason I'd recommend this book is if you're looking to learn about ZPatterns, and chances are, you aren't."
3,Outdated and Incoherent,"This book is both outdated (it discusses extensively Zope extensions that are no longer supported) and incoherent (it isjust a collection of unrelated example projects only looselytied together by the common theme of managing some content on aweb site). You're better off with the Zope Bible (for Zope) and the Content Management Bible (for CM issues generally). However,there are a few useful things in it so if you can get it for$5-10 as a remaindered book, go for it."
3,"A good, well written book, marred by a handful of errors","I was kindly asked to read this book and act as a technical reviewer, and I must say that I am glad I did. The book is well written, and has a number of well thought out examples that for the most part demonstrate clearly some of the most complex issues facing Zope Content Managers and Site Designers.Unfortunately, a few of the examples (And it is only a few) on some of the most important issues, most notably acquisition, contain glaring errors that could confuse and mislead new Zope users.I say this is unfortunate, because the quality, and pitching of the book, including numerous URLs where more information, or freely downloadable add-on products can be found, is otherwise just about perfect.Inspite of the problems I have mentioned, I would recomend that all new Zope users get this book, and work through the examples."
3,Better than the rest - but lots of bad syntax,"I've got copies of the Zope Book and Zope Web Construction Kit and this book is better than the other two, but you really have to reference the website... for updates and errata for the source code.That said - the examples in the book are short and clear and the authors _do_ seem to update the site and reply to emails when errors are found.This is the _only_ Zope book I'd recommend."
3,A bit overly detailed and dry,"I generally appreciate a good general-interest book about science and the history of science. But while this book definitely has some interesting points to make, it does get bogged down quite a bit in the very specific minutiae of the hitory of brain study. This story would make an excellent magazine article, but I think it suffers in full-length book form, and ends up being a bit too long and even (in parts) dull for the general reader."
5,So who cares if they left out Lancelot?,"OK, so I admit it. Writers have messed around before withthe ""sacred"" legend of King Arthur and the knights of theRound Table. I've even been known to yell about it myself.But, the thing is, this time it's so much fun! I'vegot to tell you, I really like this Mordred.He's got a sense of humor, he's smart, he's certainly nottoo holy (Arthur's got that market cornered), and he'spretty darned heroic. OK, so the language is a bit muchand I don't like Merlin as a prissy pervert and where theheck is Lancelot any way? (McDowell does answer that one atthe end of the book.) In spite of all these things, it's soentertaining that I just plain didn't care. If you'reinto legends about Camelot, you'll love this one!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Very original being narrated by Mordred - we don't get to hear much from his POV in most Arthurian tales. It's not your typical Arthurian legend either - lots of twists (some interesting, some disturbing).The author was a great writer and really gave Mordred a voice that we usually don't hear. He's usually overshadowed by Arthur and others.But other than the unusual perspective of the story, it was just average - nothing too great, nothing too bad. I might keep it on my shelf because I love Arthurian legends, but if I wasn't, I'd probably have no interest in this book. I'll admit though that I had no idea it was a sequel and probably would have like it more had I read it's prequel first."
1,"Not you, Uther and Merlin!","There is no alternative but to give this book ""1 star"". I wish I could give it ""minus 5"".I must disagree with every one who reviewed this book before I did. This book is horrible! The worst Arthurian tale I have ever read. Uther and Merlin are despicable. And Arthur, so proper and critical, so full of self guilt, and to make matters even worse, a religious fanatic.Don't waste your time. This book is not worth the short time you spend reading it."
3,Where's the articles?,"The books extensive listings were great as usual, and yes, the Writer's Market is necessary for any serious writer's collection. But, for some reason, they decided not to include the articles about writing on the cd. So now, if you want to look one of them up, you have to drag out the telephone book sized print copy that comes with it. Very annoying!"
1,Mac users will find CD-ROM useless,"While the book is as useful as always, the CD-ROM is a major disappointment as it runs on Windows-based PCs only. This bias against Mac users, who constitute a large percentage of writers, is a serious flaw that one hopes will be corrected in the 2001 edition."
2,cheaply made,"The car charger already fell apart. case and ear phones are okay, but not worth 20 since all I really needed was the charger piece which lasted about 2 weeks."
3,"headset and car charger very good, leather case not so good","I have no problems with the car charger and the headset.But the leather case ...I find out very difficult to get the cell phone inside the case,sometimes the keyboard didn't work because the case, but once you stretch the case it will work. Lot of problems when you have several SD cards as I do. I can't use graffiti anywhere because of the plastic (very bumpy)."
3,Wow!!,It cannot get hotter than this! I write about Irish music for a living. What an alternative!! These guys are stunning. I don't know a lot about this music. But I do what gets me dancing in my office! This is just perfect!! Wow!
5,Xlnt product,"Love Dermalogica products - this one is exceptional, as well. Clean, fresh hydrated skin with no residue. Highly recommend this product."
3,Smells like mens wash,"..that is just to me i suppose. i asked 3 friends & they thought so too. Its even worse , as is strong smelling manlyness when u use the body wash AND the lotion.On the other hand i love how soft i am =) ... im all exfoliated ."
4,"Great manual, but not outside Northamerica.","This is a complete guide to virtually all the possible maintenance routines that could be done to the car. You find very nice self-explaining diagrams and things like diagnose code charts for pre-OBDII models.The only problem to me, is that I own a 98' Celica with a 3S-FE engine. The book focused on models with 5S-FE and 7A-FE engines, as those sold in USA and Canada. Even tough, is still very helpful, because I can follow most of the procedures described, using the owner's manual to complete the missing information."
4,Right on target yet someting missing,The book had been in the making at Stanford for some time. I happened to use a manuscript of it in 1991 at Virginia Tech. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity. The book surely makes a useful companion to a plasticity textbook.It is disheartening to see that the numerical schemes for the integration of the constitutive equations of the endochronic theory are missing from the book.
4,Really needs updating,"This has been an amazing book. It describes both prescription and OTC drugs in detail without being overly technical. For years it has been an excellent reference that I have relied on. In the past few years, though, more and more of the drugs prescribed for my family have not been in the book. I really wish that the AMA would put out a fresh edition of this excellent work, which is now not nearly so useful as it once was."
2,Not for corian,"I have five of these in my shop and, I fabricate corian.I use these only for edgeing the corian.They can not take the same abuse as a PC,but they are quiet. Not a production router."
3,Basic router,"Basic router and works fine as all Makita products do. It is lacking a micro spindle to make small depth adjustments. The grip handle ads a nice operating convience. Overall good machine, but the lack of a good micro adjustment keeps it rated in the basic but good arena."
1,Makita has some serious motor problems,"I recently burned up the second Makita RD1101. All I was doing was cutting 3/8""x3/8"" rabbets in Southern Yellow Pine and this thing might have lasted 2 hours. I have also been using a PC 690 and two Bosch routers - 1617 and 1617EVS. The Makita is a piece of junk. I realized that some may say that I could have been pushing the router too hard and taking too big of a cut, but I was doing the same thing with the Bosch routers and they still run fine, even after doing 4-5 times as much work as the Makita."
5,This router kicks butt...,"I have only used this router on freehand work (rounding over, etc) but will try it in my router table if I ever get one. This is the first router I have used with a D-handle and I love it. I don't think I could use a standard base again. It is very quiet (for a router). Variable speed is nice too....like the D-handle you don't realize what a nice plus this is until you get used to it. 1/4"" and 1/2"" collets extend usefullness of this tool too. The bits could be easier to change, but it is really no more inconvience than on other routers. Haven't found many neato accessories for this one, but I hear they interchange with PC 690 routers (no shortage of accessories there). If you need a mid-size router this is the one for you (especially for freehand work). Get it, get it, get it."
2,Not great,"I would have preferred a concert video instead of this documentary. Lots of talking, not enough jamming."
1,Don't wast your money,"The basket narrows at the bottom wish I was not expecting, The price is too much. A beater price at bed&bath wish is much nicer"
3,"Right size, not quite sturdy enough","I use these baskets to collect business cards at conferences. They are the perfect shape and size and have a nice look to them, but they tend to bend and break in transit. I have an unusual use for them, so I'm sure they are great for every day house use."
3,"Good plot, but....",The book takes some interesting twists and turns. Typical Leo Waterman gusto and friends take on the world of evil-doers. The end becomes a bit too muddled as if the author got tired of the book and felt a need to finish it off. Everything suddenly works when before the antagonists were clever and able to obstruct. Still worth reading.
4,The Deader the Better,"I enjoyed the book. I like detective stories and Mr. Waterman has a little differrnt twist to his stories. He uses a group of ""bums"" to fit in to the tougher side of town to observe and report what is going on in that area because they are ""invisable"" people."
4,Enjoyable,"The Leo character is believable, like someone I would know and he brings the city of Seattle to life. There were a lot of characters involved which was mildly confusing. Overall I love the Waterman series."
2,Use caution when pulling them off!,"Definitely does a good job of covering, and I didn't even realize I had them on. Taking them off was another story. Although I pulled slowly, the adhesive on one of them actually pulled my skin off with it - much worse than pulling off a bandage. Five weeks later, I still have a scar."
4,Good for certain application,"These work quite well, but only for high drain applications. If you are just putting batteries in a radio or boombox, go with cheapies.-Joel"
3,Brow powder,"Love the product, but am very disappointed that the three items (very small cosmetics) were all shipped in three separate boxes at $5.95 each. I will never buy this brand again."
4,Eyebrows,"An excellent product for those of us who do not have full, thick eyebrows. Much better to use this product that an eyebrow pencil. It gives much more of a soft natural look. A pencil gives a harsh not youthful appearance. You will need to have a small brush to apply. That is my only negative. I wish it came with a small applicator in the case. That is the ONLY reason I am giving product 4 stars. It is truly an excellent product otherwise."
3,Great at first but dulls quickly,"I went through two of these to cut eight 14"" x 6"" holes in my 1950's era home for HVAC vents and *barely* made it. The edge dulls quickly when cutting a mix of thick drywall/plaster. A repeated 'plunging/sawing' action was required to get it to cut effectively. It did make a tough job easy but be prepared to buy a few to get the job done. All spiral saws are sacrifical in nature and will lose their edge quick so no surprises here. Three star rating due to misleading description about long life."
2,digitally remastered Tarzan?,"I recently bought the MADACY DVD version of NEW ADVENTURES OF TARZAN and agreed with reviews that considered the general quality as pretty rough. On customer recomendation I then purchased the ROAN GROUP version, as this was billed as 'digitally remastered from the finest elements', and presumably of better quality. In the light of these recommendations I have the following comments to make about the ROAN GROUP version;1) Picture and sound quality not much improved from MANDACY version.2) Extras featured; Doggie tails trailer--Toxic crusaders cartoon--Radiation march-----What connection do these features have with Tarzan?3) Plastered across the front of the box poster--'ROAN EXCLUSIVE--LLOYD KAUFMAN INTERVIEWS OLDEST LIVING DIRECTOR OF HOLLYWOOD'S GOLDEN AGE VINCENT SHERMAN (UNDERGROUND THE HARD WAY) ABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD BLACKLIST.----it wasn't on my disc."
2,Tarzan and the Green Goddess-12 chapter serial,"This serial is one of the few in which Tarzan talks like a real person. The chapters are longer than most of the serials I have seen. It's good fun for hardcore Tarzan fans. The only trouble I have with this serial, Is that chapter 4 is only 1/2 there, And chapters 5 and 6 are not anywhere on the tapes."
4,"A Good Read, but Susan's written better!","This story is good, the plot moves along smoothly, but Susan Anderson has written more exciting stories. I wasn't so much disappointed as I was a little ""at a loss"". I kept expecting that little ""zing"" from the characters as the story eveolved and this story just didn't do it."
3,I Decent Read Worth Picking Up,"This is a re-issue as stated by previous reviewers but still worth picking up. This story was not as good as some of her other suspense novels and at times I had a hard time focusing on the storyline. The chemistry between the two main characters is good and more then makes up for the lack of suspense found between the pages of this story as well as the secondary characters that have direct links with the main characters Sasha, and Mick.If you like Ms. Andersen then this will be a good novel for you to pick up. Just don't expect it to be like her current books. She was working up to the great storyteller that she has become."
3,It's a good story worth your time,"This was a light suspense story that kept my interest throughout. Sometimes Mick was a little too cave man aloha male and Sasha a little too perfect but it worked in the end. It wasn't tough to figure out whodunit but it didn't spoil my level of enjoyment. The story moved at a good pace with good dialogue and the right level of character development. Overall, it's a good story but not at the level of suspense that keeps me on the edge of my seat and speeds up my pulse rate.I would rate this a 3.5 star book but cannot round it to 4 stars because the suspense meter is a little low."
3,PDA Stylus,"The pen/stylus is a great idea, but the stylus doesn't click into the lock of my PDA like the original. Consequently, it falls out every time the PDA is tilted to horizontal or upside down. It's also a fairly expensive pen, if you ask me."
1,wrong cd,in a box set one cd was not a fav. martian cd.It was some weird latin female singer i did NOT want! Not happy with the overall order.
3,Double sided discs can be a problem,"My first copy of My Favorite Martian Season 1 had some major problems with freezing and skipping on one of the double sided discs. Would not play on most of my many DVD players.Fortunately, I returned them to amazon and the second copy was OK. The show should be 5 stars as it is a beloved classic. Some transfers however have some shaking areas. Still worth buying however as this is the best we will ever see."
3,pretty cool,This gun is pretty cool for 20 dollars. It is plastic and has a tendency to jam up but overall for the price its really cool it hurts like hell getting shot with it.
1,Peice of crap,Like that one kid said IT SUCKS it fell apart so many times ihad to super glue it then the next day it broke in the inside and once you take it apart you cant put it together
1,you guys dont know what your talking about,"THis is manufactured by CYMA!!! DOnt you know your brands. First off, it shoots so innacurate you could hit a ffreakin car if it was right in front of you, and it is completely plastic. The cocker is on the left side, and im a righty, and then it jams bbs like theres no tomorrow! Do not buy this gun, ya maybe its 20 dollars, but you dont know what your buying. and for that kid who says it hurts like hell, well, it duznt. It shoots as fast as a spring pistol.Haha, try getting shot with a full auto for 40 rounds. Now that actually ""hurts""."
3,Good Costume but........,"The dress itself was exactly as I had pictured. The color is very vibrant and bold. The flowers that adorn it, on the other hand, look very old and cheap. I wound up removing them and added my own flowers to it. The wand and crown both fell apart as soon as we took them out of the package. I had to redo them both. Overall, after I upgraded the costume it turned out very pretty. I would not tell my friends to purchase this costume unless they were prepared to do some work to it."
1,Poor quality,"I'm not sure if I just got a dud or what. It seems I'm the only reviewer who hasn't had a positive experience with this little fairy costume. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter who is big into dress up. Out of the package, the elastic on one of the straps was broken making it lop-sided. I figured I could just pin it, but then I noticed some of the flowers had fallen off. Since there wasn't time to reorder, I went ahead and gave her the costume. Here we are 2 days after Christmas, and already every piece of the costume...the dress, the wand, the wings, and the crown...is falling apart. Pretty pathetic. This one is going back to Santa's workshop for repairs."
2,Misleading Picture,The pieces themselves are great very cute... Way smaller than they look in the photo and the engine does NOT come with the set neither does the oil car in back. All you get is the two middle cars. They are good quality and very cute but the photo is misleading. Just be aware you will need to purchase the engine separately.
1,Doesn't Fit Track,I bought these train cars to go on our Thomas & Friends train track. We also have the compatible Melissa and Doug train track. The Zoo cars are much too small to fit on either track set.
4,Death Stalk,"Thought the movie was good. Vic Morrow was the lead actor and did a really good job. Have already watched it more than once. If you don't like Vic Morrow, you may not like it."
2,"This book is old, old, old!","This book is well written but quite dated. There is no mention of ""Windows"" and ""Unicode"" was only theoretical at the time. It has good background on the central issues of software internationalization but is sadly out-of-date for current software developers (especially if using Windows)."
2,Decent overview but very outdated,"This is a decent overview to some general aspects of internationalization and localization. However, there isn't a whole lot in the book that's not available from various places on the web. Furthermore, there's no discussion of Unicode, no application of Windows, and no mention of what's the right way to do things in HTML and XML. It's very, very 1994. I can't stress enough how much is missing from this book without a mention of Unicode. All examples given are in Unix, which may or may not be a negative, depending on your needs. A lot of pages are spent on various character encoding schemes, which are now almost completely irrelevant. Since there aren't that many good internationalization books, you might be better off finding information on the web."
3,"solid, but not special","What makes this score to the Walt Disney film worth listening to is the beautiful main theme. In the end credits piece we hear a great reprise of it in full outbursts of 'Horner quality'. The rest of the music is solid, but nothing special. we hear some action, suspense, all well suited for the film, but apart from it not always a good listening experience. a rare album it is though, and for the Horner fans worth the money."
2,Do not buy this program!,"I have used this product for many years. The original company Mathsoft(good company) was purchased by PTC (bad company). This single user liscence can only used on one computer. If your computer breaks or you decide to get a new one, you have to buy the software again. Single user liscences will no longer exist after version 14. PTC technical service is almost nonexistant. Even better you will very likely not be able to install this software on your computer. To get the software to install you will have to call technical service so they can give you the secret info for installation to be successful. After you get the secret info you will still have even more fun. May God have mercy on your poor soul if you buy this."
4,"Great program, just too expensive","I've used MathCad for 20 years, with my first use being for my MSEE thesis. It's a fine product for quickly programming numerical analysis and generating authoritative output. The graphics quality is good and has done my reports, proposals, and presentations a lot of good over the years. My only complaints are:1. There is not a lot of obvious difference in capability from the $59 version of 20 years ago and the $1100 version today.2. Direct documentation is limited. For the price, they should be jumping through hoops to make everything clear.3. Installation can be painful, as PTC is overly concerned about copy protection. It's common to have to call them for coaching on getting it installed."
3,Suffers from an overload of remixes,"Sure Schnappi is cute in all but musical talent, no.This song is alright, it doesn't get under my skin like Crazy Frog does, it's just animated music is rather patheic and stupid. Gorillaz are basically the only animated artists that are any good. Schnappi is just too cute for its own good.It is actually better in German than I think it would be in English, if you look at the translation the English just doesn't fit with the song at all. So overall this is an average song with equal pro's and equal con's just remember Schnappi will be gone by next year and hopefully so will Crazy Frog!"
1,Just totally awfull!,"I really wonder what is so special about this so pathetic song ""Schnappi Das Kleine Krokodil"" sung by a child, gaining popularity even amongs adults, even in far away Australia it was quite popular I noticed...Ohh My God - I thought! - I find it total awful and horibly nerving. It sadly appears that many music listeners are nowdays are so emotionally blunted by all the trash plastic pop in the charts nowdays and bad Idol cast artists, that they dont even know what real music even is, unfortunately. Actually I would have loved it to give it no stars, the song is so bad thats not even worth the one star I got to give it. So please give this Maxi and also the asociated Album of Schnappi a miss, and look for some real music for change!"
2,Hits & Misses,"I bought this cd primarily to round out my Oz pub rock collection - I'd enjoyed a number of Screaming Jets singles over the years but never enough to buy an album. I took a punt on this greatest hits collection and was disappointed.There are at most half a dozen good rock songs, such as Better, Helping Hand, Shivers, October Grey and Eve of Destruction, and maybe one or two others. The rest are bland and indistinguishable from each other.If they'd left out the ""pieces"" and cut it down to the best 10 or so songs I'd probably have given it 3.5 stars and recommended it to anyone who has enjoyed any of the above mentioned songs. However with the gems scattered through the dross, this cd rarely makes it into my stereo, so it is for hard-core fans only - who probably already have all the songs anyway.If you're looking for some awesome Oz pub rock, check out Hunters & Collectors' Under One Roof, a live recording from their final tour. Brilliant."
5,Bought as a work watch for my husband...,"I bought this a few months ago for my husband, to use as a work watch. His job is highway construction, and he is VERY rough on his watches...he typically goes through a couple a year. Normally the crystals of the watch crack quickly, he breaks the band, or busts off the stem.So far, this watch is holding up impeccably well...and it still looks new, with one small exception. The black 'crystal protector' (not sure what you call that thing), is slightly scratched. But he did that by abusing it at work.Update: After 2 1/2 years of VERY heavy usage, the band of the watch finally broke. I am amazed that it lasted so long, since as mentioned above, my husband is notoriously hard on his work watches. I ordered the exact watch for him again, since we were so pleased with the original purchase."
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,THE ANALOG PORTION OF THIS WATCH CANNOT BE RESET. THERE IS NO REMEDY TO FIX IT.THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SETTING /RESETTING THIS WATCH ARE VERY COMPLICATING AND CONFUSING.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING CASIO AGAIN.
1,Fell apart,"I bought this watch for my husband 5 months ago. He was wearing it mainly on weekends. He got in the pool with it once, and water got into the watch. So much for it being water resistant. A few weeks ago, the little strap on the band (to secure the strap) broke. Poor quality watch."
2,Fancy Smancy,"Beautiful book but not what I was looking for. The recipes were more for throwing a fancy smancy outdoor bridal luncheon than a fun, everyday, family picnic. I was throwing a 30th anniv picnic for my parents with 40 people. The recipes, while they looked delicious, would not have appealed to the broad attendee list and would have been far too much fuss for me to make for that large of a crowd."
3,Could be better,"I got this selection of poetry because it's Akhmatova's highlights (e.g. Requiem and Poem Without a Hero) by a reliable publisher, but when I went to read Requiem I was a bit underwhelmed: I've read more moving, less wooden translations of the poem. I've studied Russian (not to the extent that I would be able to understand or appreciate the work entirely in its intended language) and Russian literature (in English) and I think I'll try Walter Arndt's translations (I was pleased by his translations of Pushkin's poetry) next time."
5,The rascals of the railway - A review of the Giggling Troublesome Trucks,"If your child enjoys playing with the Thomas & Friends wooden trains, the Troublesome Trucks are the rascals of the railway, featured in nearly every episode of Thomas & Friends. (See previous review for a list of all the accidents the Troublesome Trucks have caused.) The Giggling Troublesome Trucks both have their own way of rickety rocking motion. The Troublesome Truck with the red tarp rocks up and down, while the Troublesome Truck with ballast rocks side to side. Also, when the red tarp is pushed, the trucks giggle.Overall, 5 stars. The Giggling Troublesome Trucks are definitely a worthy addition to your child's Thomas Wooden Railway."
4,very nice quality railway wagon,both trucks do wiggle; one from side to side and one from front to back- only one of the trucks is batterie powered and 'giggles'. But they are very cute and durable. A good buy overall!
3,Giggling and Troublesome are okay,These two train trucks are okay but not really great. They move back and forth while moving so there is some action but otherwise they seem to be more of fillers to make up the rest of the train.Took forever for the order to be filled and then shipped so don't be in a hurry.
3,"Love giggling, but too wiggly","I love the giggling of the red car when you push the top. However, I must have failed to read details about this product, because I didn't realize the cars would wiggle as they go down the track. It's sort-of cute, I guess, but it seems to encourage the cars/train jumping off the tracks."
2,I was a little disappointed.,One of the batteries one of them died three days after Christmas!! I was a little upset by that. The other one is fine and is loud and sturdy.
3,ok for the bedroom,this set is a fine choice for your bedroom but I would not recommend it as your primary set as it is not a true high def 1080i set the picture is good when used with a high def box from the cable company a blueray or cd player with a hdmi connection but the built in dvd player is a little disappointing
1,A piece of JUNK!,Purchased this unit from sears in Oct 07 and in Feb08 we had our first problems. The unit simply quit. The repair man advised that two of the three boards inside was bad. After having to wait for the company to make new boards we finally got it fixed. It worked fine for a while until the Screen started separating. June 2010. Repair man advised it was not repairable so we contacted sears with our service agreement and found out they would not refund or trade for a same price unit. Instead they said TV's are cheaper now so they would only credit about half of what we paid for this unit. Now I'm getting a 400 dollar tv for seven hundred dollars...A big ripoff. I will not shop at sears again and I will not buy another sylvania tv again either.
5,"Excellent read, wish he added more games","I read this a month or so ago. Now I will buy it and re-read it periodically. Excellent, highly readable analysis I found to be better then similar books."
5,"The first chess book I ever bought,","And from the first day I haven't stopped learning from it. I have gone over the games time and time again, and I am still simply blown away by both the games and the annotations. I gained around 200 points over all from studying this book."
5,Nice games collections....,"This is book #4 of Seirawan's great 'PLay Winning Chess' series. This book is loaded with some great games which are all nicely annotated by the 'Yaz.' This work can be enjoyed by all though but it really fits in nicely since those who have read books #1,2,& 3 can truely see if they have absorbed the info in Yaz's prior works."
3,hard to believe,"Overall, not a bad book. Interesting games, but I would be surprised if most experienced players had not seen almost all of them before. Clearly annotated, but obviously targeted at below approximately 1800 or so. But the part of the book I found hardest to believe, and could not help myself from commenting on, was the inclusion of two of Seirawan's own games. In the past 25 years, he himself has won two of the most brilliant 12 chess victories? hard to believe, I think."
1,Very Disappointing,"The kit was missing the 3-peice air lock set (which it was supposed to come with) so when I was all geared up to start making wine, I had to stop dead in my tracks. The kit makes wine making look way too complicated and I don't find the instructions to be thorough enough. It left me with a lot of questions and it's not like I can ask the guy in the dvd!"
1,Who has time for all this?,The process is too time consuming and not worth bothering with. I can't imagine anyone following the directions step by step unless they are playing scientist and have nothing else to do.
2,Incomplete and deceptive description,"The quality of the items sent in this kit were fine. What irked me was that it was described as all I would need to produce a batch of wine. FAR from it. There was no yeast, no camden tablets, no yeast nutrient, no tannin, no oxidizer, no bentonite or other clarifier, not enough corks for the six gallons the carboy holds. The DVD instructions are frustrating, with no written instructions. It is a pain to refer to a DVD for some detail you might need, such as a temperature requirement. My wine setup is not even in the same building as my computer. With this kit, I had to immediately make another order for stuff that should have been included or at the very least itemize exactly what is in the kit, so your customer knows what he is or is NOT getting."
3,Fairly Comprehenive kit,"This kit provides most of the materials to make wine. You will need 23 liters or 6 gallons of wine must or a concentrate of course. Note that the carboy is six gallons like the fermenting bucket, so be ready to top off the carboy to keep oxygen out, since your rackings will remove more and more sediment/wine (I used an argon/nitrogen gas blend to keep the wine fresh after fermentation stopped). Do not overuse your sulpher cleaning packets, you will need to sterilize everything after each use, including your bottles (which will also be bought separately). For the money however this is a fine kit to make roughly 30 bottles of wine at home with."
4,Great kit for the price,"I'm very pleased with this purchase. It makes the process of wine making affordable and simple for anyone. It contains literally every item you need to successfully brew and bottle wine.I would recommend ordering a spring tip bottle filler it makes the bottling process go much, much smoother, and this kit doesn't contain one. Make sure to buy a spring tip bottle filler is the same diameter as the tubing the kit comes with.I gave 4 stars (instead of 5) because they could easily include a bottle filler for a mere $3.00 extra."
5,good deal,Good product Has everything you need to get started except the juice. Could use an instruction manual for beginners but there are plenty of good books on here.
3,"Great, untill the pads started going out.","The mpc1000 is great fun, and has very accurate timing with no latency performance recording.One by one, the pads started losing there response. After reading online i found many many others with the same problem who were able to narrow it down to poor engineering of the contacts under the pads. I know that the mpc2000 was engineered without this flaw, but i'm not sure about the 2500 or the 500?"
5,Industry Standard!,"I love this beat machine. see what i did with mine at [...]. Also, you MUST purchase drum kits for it. You can get some at [...]. They are fully customizable as well. i would also recommend purchasing ram and the MPC hard drive Kit."
4,MPC1K !!!!!!!!!,Bottom line is this....I would cry if something happened to my MP. Have you ever seen a grown man cry? It's nothing nice.
1,Very dissappointed with Amazon Service,"I ordered a new Verizion phone via Amazon on 2/8/09. I have never had such a cluster of poor service, bad information, and inability to get the problems resolved ( still working after 5 weeks ). #1 - Amazon double entered the order - ""no problem said customer service - return 1 unopened - which I did"". Verizion still has not gotten the confirmation from Amazon that this phone was returned - and after 5 weeks is still trying to charge me for it - even though never activated. #2 - took 4 days and endless phone calls to get the 1 phone I did want activated - again because Amazon had never turned over the info to Verizion. I have never has such a bad time with an Amazon order - and I still cannot get resolution or any assistance from ANYBODY at Amazon. HUGELY DISSAPPOINTED !!! I rate this as a negative 25 .. NObody at Amazon gives a damn about this and will help me."
1,Blu-ray transfer from VHS?,"Since this is one of my favorite Dario Argento films, I was really pleasantly excited to be able to get this great giallo on Blu-ray. However, upon watching this version, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Instead of seeing Blu-ray sharpness, the picture is grainy and mushy. Picture resolution is not nearly as good as on the older, standard DVD. It appears that transfer on this one was made straight from an old, VHS tape without any clean-up being attempted. It's really a shame, too, because this item comes with a really informative booklet describing the film, a film poster, and an appreciable number of disk extras. I have a substantial collection of Blu-rays and Tenebrae has absolutely the worst picture quality of the lot. Maybe someday, someone will issue an acceptable edition of this great thriller - but this one is better to pass!"
4,Good Stories,"This book had a lot of good stories told about experiences people have had that could indicate they had some past life experiences. The stories sound sincere, but may not be actual past life experiences but have some other explanations."
1,"Nice to look at, just don't wear it.","A nice looking watch, but way too fragile. The glass covering the watch face broke the second day I wore it."
1,glass breaks - worthless,"A decent, lightweight, thin, stylish watch - suitable for the office or out on the town. The band fits like a bracelet versus a ""regular"" watchband.I've owned it for a few months now and haven't had any problems.update (as of 2009): there is a design flaw in this model where the glass face breaks apart. worthless."
1,"yes, it's true","Just like the others who have reviewed this watch, the crystal on mine broke less than a week after I received it from Amazon. I took a short nap and woke up to realize that my watch face had shattered. I did not hit it against anything and there was no excessive pressure applied to the crystal. It is obviously a design flaw and I will ask for a replacement model."
1,fragile,This watch broke less than a week after I received it. It is a nice looking watch except that the face is covered by a thin layer of glass. I didn't even realize that I shattered it until I went to put it on the next day. If you need the least bit of durability with your watch do not purchase this one.
4,Extended Fun,"We really enjoy ""The Mousery."" Our four-year old gets a kick out of saying ""the mousery"" at the right spots in the text. The illustrations are wonderful and have given us lots of fodder for extended discussion of this story, mice, uses for old cars, and berry growing, among other things. That's one of the things that I think is important in books for this age group--you should be able to take the text and go on with it so the kids get used to thinking about stories, not just hearing them. This book got us going so far we even made our own ""mousery"" out of some boxes, fabric, etc. That was a project that took us through several long winter days and still holds our attention when we bring it out. Yep, we like ""The Mousery"" very much."
3,"Great illustrations, an OK story, but the rhymes are limp.","Two grouchy old mice live in an ancient shell of an abandoned car. The illustrations are top-notch and our 3 year old grandson loves talking about them. The story is all right, though the plot is not strong. The verse is grating because of the constant use of the word ""mousery"" to rhyme with itself. After the 4th time this happened in just a few pages, grandpa handed the book to grandma and said, ""You finish reading it to him, I can't stand any more."" Only Great Aunt Nina really loves the verse and thinks the rhymes are just so sweet. The three year old likes the book, but it is not a favorite. He was through with it after just a few readings. Books he LOVES, such as The Color Kittens and Runaway Bunny (both by Margaret Wise Brown)he wants over and over and can recite by heart."
4,Great Movie,"It does start out a little bit boring. You do need to watch from the beginning and the school scenes are very important even when he is getting off the bus. I really liked most of the film. I could watch it over and over. However, some of the scenes with the 5 year old should of have been either edited out or touched up. I found those scenes to be inappropriate. So, I would recommend this for 13 years and older including adults. Because of those bad scenes I am giving it a rating of 4, instead of a 5. What really surprised me was the very ending. It also leaves some questions opened. Like what happen the next day at school?"
1,What a stinker!,"What a huge waste of money! I bought this movie thinking it would be a fun family movie and was so incredibly dissappointed. The acting is horrible, the special effects are not at all special and it is quite innappropriate with a little boy participating in a game of strip poker with some teenagers. I really wish I had not purchased this. One of the worst movies I have ever seen!"
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]- @tss5078,"Monster Night was a horror-comedy for kid produced by National Lampoon's and it looked kind of interesting. Looks are of course deceiving and this movie was a bomb. I don't think kids would even like this movie. It's cheesy, the effects are awful, and the acting is so over the top that it just destroys any credibility this film may have had. There are movies without a plot, that are hard to follow, that are boring, and so forth, but this, this was just all-around terrible!"
1,No star - not even a twinkle!,"I've seen some really awful kids' halloween programs but you could tolerate them as ""cute"" - this movie has NO REASON to be released, acted in, or even on this planet. It STUNK! The acting was beyond horrible and the adults in the movie should be institutionalized. Please don't purchase. It belongs in the trash!"
4,Chase Durer is a Must DO...,"CHASE-DURER PILOT COMMANDER ALARM CHRONO WATCH 116.9BS6-BRO5I ordered this watch (Chase Durer Pilot Commander Alarm Chronograph), and I must say, so far I'm very pleased by the overall presentation, appearance, size, weight, feel, and quality. Amazon did deliver on time as promised.Please see the pictures and captions below pictures that I've posted for details and thoughts on this watch. I also ordered the Seiko SNA411P1 stainless steel pilot alarm quartz chronograph from this site (amazon.com) and I will be doing a side-by-side comparison shortly.Overall, I have watches ranging from $4000(rolex) to $19.99 (casio), and I must say,...this Chase Durer is poised to be one of my favorites. Beautiful watch for any price. And unlike EACH of my high-end automatics, I do NOT have to spend $399 every 2-3 years on ""lubrication"" and ""maintenance."" Very pleased with product, price, accuracy, and style of product.Look for my review of the Seiko sna411. Coming soon."
1,TAG who?,"Well, I was killing myself looking for a Tag under $600 that was not a plastic type sports watch. I always like the looks of the Chase Durer but never saw one in person. Soldier of Fortune mag always has them on the back cover and I read the watch is worth more like a Rolex but at a much reasonable price. The watch arrived and I am out of my mind with joy. I got the Pilot Commander and the Wing commander. One casual and one for dress.I will buy from Amazon and fine watches again real soon."
3,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased the starter kit in 2006 to paint the wrought iron railing in my front porch. I finished sanding and painting the railing and used rustoleum paint as a top coat to finish it in black since this paint is silver in color. I checked in 2008 to see for signs of rust and I must say, I haven't seen it yet. I am giving this product three stars for the poor customer service. I contacted Rust Bullet's customer service to enquire about the product, but I wasn't able to get intouch with them either through phone or e-mail."
2,Another Viewpoint,"The book promises quite a lot, but does not deliver even for a slim volume. The relative lack of useful content is further complicated by the author's rather cynical prose and obvious lack of joy about collecting. There are some useful definitions and web site references, but overall you may not want to add this work to your collection."
4,"""Please be Seated""","This keyboard ""rack"" is rock solid product designed more for professional use than for the rest of us. You must stand up in order to use the second and third tier. Only the bottom tier is actually adjustable up or down. The 2nd and 3rd tier are adjustable in a tilt only. Depending on the height (not width) of your keyboards adjustment can be severely limited. This rack does not have an adjustment for width either. Only the the keyboard support rails are adjustable. If I was a pro, I'd consider the more expensive On Stage Rack. As a lazy amateur enthusiast, I might be happier with a lower rack so I may be seated. >>>S.Spurgin"
2,Nice watch ... until the crystal shatters,"This is a very nice watch ... until the crystal shatters for no apparent reason. I wore it less than two months before picking it up off the counter one morning to find that the (apparently extremely fragile) crystal had shattered. Look at the reviews for other Skagen watches before you buy (sadly, I didn't). The story is the same."
2,"Very beautiful watch, but...","I Think the display area is a little bit big. In one month, the glass broke , simply because i touched the zipper of my jacket. When i took a cloth to clean it, it cracked."
2,Nice watch Until....,"I agree that this is a nice watch; however, that's until the crystal shatters for no real reason, all after a couple months. Seems like a quality issue since others had the same result."
4,GET BACK IN THAT CELLAR!,"I LIKE THIS CD VERY MUCH. I'VE SEEN ANTHOLOGIES ON MANY OF THESE ARTISTS BUT WHAT ABOUT A CD WITH THE RECORDINGS OF CAROLYN CRAWFORD? SHE WAS AND STILL IS A MUCH BETTER SINGER THAN MANY OF THE FEMALE ""STARS"" AT MOTOWN AND SHE WAS JUST A TEENAGER WHEN SHE WAS WITH THE COMPANY. HER FIRST RELEASE WAS A SONG CALLED ""FORGET ABOUT ME"" AND IN THE OPINION OF SOME PEOPLE IT'S A MOTOWN CLASSIC. PEOPLE REALLY OUGHT TO HEAR SOME OF THE MUSIC SHE RECORDED AND IT'S ALL VERY GOOD BECAUSE MUCH OF IT WAS ""PRODUCED BY SMOKEY"". NEED I SAY MORE?"
2,"ok,better available","This item is ok,but much better topical pain reliever's available.Product has an odor and can be tricky to apply due to odor."
4,Already reviewed,I already submitted a review for this product so now I am trying to take up enough space so It will let me quit.
2,Not effective for me,"I am having some tendons or joint pains in the elbow. Some time, after hiking I have some muscle or again joint pains. I had great hopes but I cannot say I felt any better after using this product."
4,Cooling relief,This stuff feels great! I just used some on my back/neck and it feels like a numbing ice pack. Great for instant relief.
4,ZHENG GU external analesic,"This product is great!!! I've had terrible back pain and was using icy hot. This product is so much better, and gave me some relief. I would highly reccoment it."
2,Ball Is WAY Too Big,"Product looks exactly like it was described and came in a small bag that wasn't opened. However, I haven't even worn it because the ball is extremely too big, it's actually bigger than any other tongue ring ball I've seen. Very uncomfortable."
3,Freezer organization,Bought these to organize my freezer. Didn't work as well as I thought it would. Nice little baskets tho. Probably can use them for something else.
4,Nice Organizer,This is an attractive wire basket that can be used for decorative or practical purposes. I use mine on the kitchen countertop to roll up and store bright-colored kitchen towels. I just wish the handles would stand up - they fall over to the side.
4,Classic Cash Register given to four year old,"This is a wonderful example of an old-fashioned ""plunk the keys"" cash register, and the drawer opens with a bell. There are marvellous picture keys to punch and see popups in the price window. Our only problem was that there was also a small electronic window at the top where things might have happened..but the batteries that drove this section were apparently 'dead' and were not accessible for us to change. The four year old certainly did NOT need the electronic window, as she was very happy with punching the keys, hearing the bell and seeing the popups in the price window, so we just left it at that."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this for my 2+ yr. old nephew. He started playing with it immediately. It comes with fake bills that have numbers on them with cute characters, also a good size that is perfect for his little hands. The toy is durable. He easily pressed the buttons and opened and closed it repeatedly. The pop up peek-a-boo characters made him laugh. It's got an old school charm and style to it. Not too noisy and doesn't require batteries."
5,Great sturdy and good value,This cash register is really great. I was surprised at how well made it is. Very sturdy and durable. Even has a solar calculator. I bought it for my grandson because he likes to press the buttons on my desk calculator. He's a little young for this cash register. It's really great for kids of all ages.
5,"Masons is a fun, reasonably simple strategy boardgame.","I'm an avid boardgamer, and this one is definitely in the medium-level strategy category, and is always fun. It's a game of choices and area control, with the handicapping feature of giving most people points when each person scores. It's a fairly quick game, taking usually not more than 45 minutes to an hour. For much more info on this game (this is NOT an advert!), check out:[...]"
2,Flawed design,New design for quick adjustment to depth and bevel is flawed. It is not quick . Jams often.The standard table on previous 13 amp models still remains my choice. Either replace this new design or put back the old ones.
5,The BEST tracks off the BEST 3 Fat Boys CD's! CLASSIC!,TRACK LISTING:1. The Fat Boys Are Back2. Jail House Rap3. Human Beat Box4. In The House5. All You Can Eat6. Fat Boys7. Sex Machine8. Stick 'Em9. Hard Core Reggae10. Rock 'N' Roll
4,versatile,"I recently had to borrow a feather board from a friend. I had broken a home made one. So I did and found it be totally versatile easy to use and take off. It also felt very comfortable in many different positions. Changing angles quickly and it also was very accurate, no hangups. The material also allows the wood to pass through without binding. So I automatically went to the amazon.com web site found it and ordered it, along with the bench dog blade lock easy blade change is a must to keep your blades and cuts accurate. I'm waiting anxiously. THANK YOU IFLEM-INC."
4,clever but over-priced,"I bought this to use with a $200 Craftsman 10"" table saw only to discover that it will not fit the Craftsman miter slot (evidently, Craftsman elected not to make the slot a standard size on their cheaper models). So if you are wanting to use it with a Craftsman table saw, unless you know the miter slot size is adequate, don't waste your money. I have a Bench Dog router table that I will use this featherboard with, so it wasn't a total waste. However, it is way over-priced for something that is made almost entirely of plastic."
3,Doesn't fit the Makita saw miter groove,"I like this featherboard a lot and, once I figured out how to use it with my Makita table saw (a tool with very narrow, shallow miter grooves) it has functioned as advertised. Took some doing, though. Basically, I ended up shaving down the featherboard's pinch cleat and adding some plex pads to make it fit and slide in the Makita's groove. Problem was not Bench Dog's; it was (and remains) Makita's."
2,Fix the knobs!!!!!!,I have the same complaint as others that reviewed this item.... the knobs are crap. One of them stripped out the first time I used it. The black plastic is too soft to just push a hex nut into it and not expect it to turn when tightening into your miter slot. A better knob would have the threaded insert molded into it and the plastic would be glass or mineral filled not just your run of the mill nylon. Other than that the item works as it should. Come on Bench Dog put another 25 cents into your cost and fix the knobs!
3,Not perfect,"I like Bench Dog stuff, but I am disappointed in this featherboard. Like other people have said, it slips in the miter slot unless you really crank it down. I even scuffed up the sides to get some more grip. I just replaced mine with the maglock magnetic feather boards. While they're more expensive they work great if you have a cast iron table saw top. Also, their universal feather board can be found at HD made for Ridgid for $10 less than anywhere else."
4,Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix,"I thought that (1)package of cocoa was enough to receive a good chocolate taste, and the marshmallows gave an additional sweetness, for a nice cup of hot cocoa."
4,Nestle hot cocoa mix double chocolate meltdown,"This is such a good hot cocoa mix with more flavor than most because of the ""double chocolate"". I'm frustrated because I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores any more. So I ordered a whole case from Amazon. Hooray for Amazon!"
5,A Great Refreshing Drink,This is a great drink and is a shame it has been discontinued by Nestles. I have always enjoyed the taste and it is always refreshing to drink.
5,Makes great frappacinos!,"Although it might be closer to milk chocolate than dark chocolate flavor, it makes great cheap fraps using two envelopes with a teaspoon of instant coffee and 2 cups of ice water."
2,Disappointing,"I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown. This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad. However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed. This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet. It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors."
4,Beats Swiss Miss by a Mile!,I've tried most commercial brands and find I like this the best. It is great for making a mocha.
5,"I'll tip my cup with thumbs UP to this yummy, hot beverage!","This is a delicious Fat Free Hot Chocolate mix. I have had a difficult time finding it at grocery stores so decided to buy a box of 4. While yes, it will last me a long while and seems like an awful lot of cocoa mix, it does last on the shelf in the vacuum sealed (plastic top) container. I will enjoy many a cold winter night sipping delicious hot cocoa! This will also give me the chocolate ""fix"" (year round) that I crave, with a lot less calories!"
1,250% Price increase!,"Six weeks ago I bought this for $19.99, now it is priced at $49.99. What is going on? This is just wrong."
1,April 6 2011 was only $18.75.Now is $39.95 for 4 pack!,"I LOVED this product...tasted wonderful. Much better than any other, and only 25 cal. serving. I used in my coffee every morning. But when I went to reorder today, the price for a 4 pak of 7.3oz cannisters is now $39.95 instead of $18.75 when I ordered from Amazon April 6 2011. I'm sorry to lose this treat, but the price rise is a deal killer."
5,No longer searching,"I no longer need to search for a canister of Nestles hot cocoa. As the stores that carry it dwindled, I became more and more frustrated. Now, I know where I can find it at the tip of my fingers. I did have to buy 4, but that was no problem, as I share it with family members who were having the same problem."
5,Hot cocoa in Coffee,We use a tsp. of this in our coffee each morning. I cannot buy it in the store where I live anymore. I was so grateful to find in on Amazon and it was so easy to order and have delivered to my front door. Try it you will like it.
1,"Sugar, corn syrup, AND artificial sweetener? No thanks!","I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office. Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste. Nasty. Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss. Adios, Nestle."
1,Worst Cocoa Ever,"Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa. If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product, you don't have a human tongue. The drink you're supposed to enjoy smells exactly like bales of hay. And twenty seven clams? Does it come with shares of stock in the company?"
2,What happened to the larger cans??,Question: Are the larger (27.7 oz.) cans of the Nestle Rich Milk Chocolate cocoa mix (39 servings) no longer available?? The texture and taste of the cocoa in the smaller cans is nowhere near as good as the cocoa we have previously ordered.Thank you.Vernon Aune
5,a little extra,great added to your morning coffee! Doesn't add all the sugar like the regular hot cocoa mix! Moca low cal
3,Fat Free Cocoa,"The lowest calorie count that still has some flavor, although the flavor isn't much to write home about; we make it with fat-free milk which makes a good morning drink; frequently hard to find in grocery stores, thus ordering on-line is a necessity."
1,Way over priced.,"This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers. A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price. If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price. I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com. A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free."
1,Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product,"I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store. The product became unavailable and I couldn""t find it anywhere. Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price. However, after receiving it and having a cup - it TASTED nothing like the store bought product. It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be. There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure. Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want. Beware !!!"
5,Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix,I purchased this pack of 4 because the size is perfect for my husband to take to work. He loves this brand of cocoa with the rich milk chocolate taste. He likes to mix it with his French press coffee and make a poor man's mocha. Tastes great and saves us money!
5,YUMMY!,"YUMMY.I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years. Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan. Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink. It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink! Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain."
5,Best hot chocolate ever!,"This is the best hot chocolate ever! Low calories, fat & carbs. Mix it with fat free cream and it is truly out of this world!"
4,"Good hot cocoa mix, but....","I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we'venever had before. My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,but I never really cared for it. Well, I still don't. This is aflavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the MilkChocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy. This flavoris OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'llgo back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix andNestle's wins, there's no contest. After all, as they say,""Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate""."
4,Like it in coffee,"I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of ""Double Chocolate Meltdown"".But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee. It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee, and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation. Love it for that!"
4,Good Beginnings,This is a great starter set that I bought for my children. The water tower is a big hit--it looks like the water runs out when you move the handle down.The set up: younger kids will need help putting it together.Adults will want to find a safe place to keep the paper that tells you exactly how to set it up. It is a figure 8 shape and if you don't put the right pieces in the right place it won't make it all the way around.FYI: I also did not know that the Thomas the Train pieces you buy at Target do not fit all Thomas tracks.
5,Great starter set,This is a great starter set for any Thomas and Friends Fan. The quality is great and easy to follow instructions.
4,A good starter kit,"This is a good starter kit if you're interested in getting into the Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway toys without spending a bundle. The water tower and bridge are fun, and they'll integrate nicely with whatever other kits you buy to expand it later. I've found the Wooden Railway product line to be durable and fun for my son, who is almost three. Encourages good, imaginative play."
5,thomas,i would recommend thomas stuff to anyone. you can connect all the other sets to it and my son loves it. it may be a few more dollars but it is worth it. doesn't look cheap and its easy to connect the pieces.
4,train set,"my three year old grandson loves trains and this was a perfect starter train set. It's easy to put together and has given him hours of fun. This also included the water tower so was a perfect,complete starter set for him."
2,It's not the same,"This is worst season of the series. I don't like the fact that Holly, Bridget and Kendra are on the cover and they barely appeared on the show. Also, it was boring the whole time. The girls don't have personalities: The twins are just two dumb bimbos, and Crystal is not enough to keep the series interesting as it was, they tried too hard to make her the new Holly but it didn't worked well. Overall, I prefer to believe that this season never existed...Just don't buy this, please. Better save your money on Holly's and Kendra's spin-offs DVD's."
1,3 Gold Diggers With No Intellect What So Ever....,"I refused to watch Season Six of The Girls Next Door for the simple fact no more,Holly,Bridget, and Kendra. I knew they were all worthless ""Gold Diggers"" in this supposed new season. I was definitely right about Crystal Harris only using Hef to get her so called pathetic singer career started. What a trashy,ugly,stupid,skank (Crystal Harris). Those twins are just big old air heads and gold diggers as well. I would only purchase Seasons 1-5, since those were the episodes worth watching."
4,Not as good as the original cast.,"This was an entertaining season, but not as good as the original Girls next Door cast. I still enjoyed watching, but no one could replace Holly, Bridget and Kendra!"
4,Girls Next Door Season 5,"At first after reading the other reviews I thought this would make me hate the new girls given what Hef did to Holly, Bridget and Kendra. You actually fall in love with Crystal and how nice she comes across as (just shows how good of an actor she is considering everything thats happened after the show! lol) its really not that bad but you can't help but love the other 3 girls more because they have much more personality and they seemed right for Hef.. but O how things can change in a flash"
4,I still have faith,I'm still trying to have a little faith in the fearless books.They are losing some of there greatness.But it did have some ok parts like when Gaia saves the child from the mugger. And when Ed starts to walk that was good. But I really think the next book Fear will be a little better. I really hope there will be a fearless female freak fight to happen between Heather and Gaia. I need something intesting to happing in these books.
2,Yawn-Worthy,"I am beginning to get angry with where the fearless books are going. This book was absolutely boring. NOTHING happened as far as the Gaia/Ed/Tatiana triangle, which I think is the most interesting aspect going on right now. Basically the book just had to do with Gaia's realization that someone she knows is a traitor. There wasn't enough going on in this book. The other thing that is beginning to make me mad is that Francine Pascal just can't let Gaia be happy. Geez...she's been dragging out the whole ""Gaia can't get close to people otherwise they die"" thing out for 23 books already. Can't she give the girl a break! Or at least write something else interesting OR stop charging [so much]. We, the readers, can't afford to lose so much money on bad writing. All in all, the book left me kind of disgusted."
3,Okay.........................there are better books,"I used to be totally hooked on fearless,but after book 19 it started to drag. Gaia is still avoiding Ed (nothing new).Ed is avoiding Titianna so they do not have to talk about the kiss.And Gaia and Titanna hates each other's guts.That is screwed.francine revels a tratior. Tom and Natasha are put in prison by Loki's men. Loki is STILL trying to get to Gaia and to kill Tom.In the sneak peak THERE is a possible chance thet Tom is dead.Gaia and Titianna have a little truce.But what I am are saying there were betterbooks in this series."
4,hmmmmm,"well you cant expect gaia to have a interesting life all the time now can we? yes it is frustrating to see gaia and ed not being together -as we all know they should be- but gaia is trying to not get him killed. being gaia must be a very hard job. Heather who has a stick up her ... -like always- is now so jealous that she wants to be exactly like gaia. which everyone knows is just gonna get her killed. pretty soon everyone will be dead and the only person gaia is gonna have -again- is Ed. she has no family, no friends, and she's trying to be a normal teenager. i think pascal is doing a great job and should keep it up. i dread the day when the series ends and ill have to start reading something non-exciting."
5,Great for learning patterns and pronunciation,"I started learning thai with the AUA series and have gone through the three books. All build on each other in an orderly fashion, you really have the choice of just focusing on speaking or you can incorporate the reading/writing too. The only negative is that the vocabulary is often times not as useful. ""A cow is smaller than a water buffalo"" I combined this series with the Colliquial Thai course and the combo addressed each others weaknesses."
2,Hard to understand,I am Thai and trying to teach my friend Thai language. I think the book is hard to understand and not intuitively study. Now I use material from other books and materials which are much easier for me to teach and for my friend to understand.
1,STOP RIGHT THERE!,"What kind of a gimmick is this? These are the 1980's versions of the Beatles CDs. I bought this set years ago for about a third of the price listed here. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this price! There is no reason for the price of this box set to appreciate. As another reviewer says, the 2009 remasters have made this box set obsolete. Compared with the new CDs, the sound on this set is like throwing a couple of sheets over your speakers. And the box is just normal wood--not even Norwegian! I can't believe this is Amazon! Buy the new remastered box set. There is no more purpose for this set other than artifact or museum piece."
3,"need more pics, and a better description of the contents.","i'm finding this box set on various websites, wondering what exactly it is, what exact songs it has (and an exact number.. over two hundred can mean 201) what cds it has... i'm seriously considering buying it, but only if i know its worth it"
1,Doesn't work,"Two of the wheels have a built-in brake, but the third doesn't. There is one in the package, but it's loose and there is no way to attach it to the frame by the third wheel. After several calls for support I was told that ""the design is changing"" and in the future the third brake will be welded to the frame. The current design? No way to do it. Thanks."
2,messy,I did not like this product because it gets all over the place- verymessy. Also when you put it on your face it looks white on the face and it doesn't vanish like it says it's suppose to.
4,A great live showcase of a Bossa Nova master,Johnny Alf is one of the former Brazilian composers to fuse Jazz into Brazilian music. His strong Jazz accent made him be honored as one of Bossa Nova founders.He composes and writes his own inspired lyrics. He also plays the piano in all his albums.This is a live showcase of some of his great standards plus some new material.
2,Cool but hard to use,It looks very cool but hard to operate with your thumb. I will prefer the one with trigger.
5,GM Ford writes a great crime novel,Really enjoy the character development and how each books stands alon but also weaves a story with previous books. Easy read.
4,Good read,"This is a very good book. Kept me guessing till the end. I had never read anything by this author before, I'm glad I took a leap of faith and tried him out."
4,Enjoyable Read,I have grown quite interested in the Frank Corso stories written by G. M. Ford. Mr. Ford has a wonderful knack for the telling of a very believable story.
5,The start of another great series for G.M. Ford.,"G.M. Ford's ""Fury"" is an attention getting noirish ticking clock mystery---from page one I was hooked.Newspaperman/true crime author Frank Corso is the protagonist in Mr. Ford's second series. He's a hard boiled, cynical anti-hero who prefers his solitude.He is a clever, resourceful and relentless archangel type---undaunted in his quest for justice as defined by his sense of right and wrong. Fiercely loyal to his friends, he is a commanding presence.Mr. Ford's atmospheric writing places the reader right in Seattle as Corso and his allies have six days to clear a venal death row inmate.It is a riveting plot that moves at a breakneck pace, told from multiple points of view.Mr. Ford has created another series peopled with characters you care about. ""Fury"" is the initial entry---highly recommended."
5,"practical, inspiring, validating","I was burnt out, suffering from chronic fatigue. I had been getting better slowly, connecting with my inner wisdom and intuition, rebuilding my sense of self and learning new more self-caring ways of investing my energy. A friend recommended this book.....Wow!! I felt validated in my experience and pain through the experience of the author and the many others she quotes in the book. And I got more GREAT ideas to support me in getting better through new attitudes towards life, letting go and radical trust!More than any other single thing, this book has kept me on track and inspired me in my healing, as I grow into a new, healthier life.God bless this author for sharing her great wisdom!!!!!!!!!"
1,top grain leather?,"Holes in the pockets after six months. Too bulky, not really good for indoor use. Way too heavy.Buy an Occidental."
1,terrible design,"not sure who the contractor was who designed it, but I don't think he or she has ever worn a tool belt. I have had this now for over 6 years and have hated it every second I have owned it. The layout is completely off, the wide mouth pockets they say is a feature is just good for letting everything fall out as you walk. I could go on, but you get the idea."
4,review,After owning the product for about a year i decided to write this review. My overall thoughts is that it is a great product. The different size pockets with all the different tool holders makes it a great product.
1,THE WORST,"SOME POCKETS TOO SMALL,FASTENERS CAN HIDE IN THE ROLL,NO PLACE FOR CATS PAW(NAIL PULLER),WHEN YOU SET IT DOWN IT TURNS ON IT`S SIDE SO EVERYTHING FALLS OUT.POUCHES SLIP BEHINDYOU.YOUR ALWAYS CHASING YOUR STUFF. BEEN IN CONSTRUCTION FOR 30 YEARS.WITHOUT A DOUBT,THE WORST RIG I HAVE EVER OWNED. OCCIDENTAL LEATHER MAKES A MUCH BETTER ONE. WISH SOMEONE HADEN`T STOLEN MINE."
1,top grain leather my...,Holes in the pockets after only a year of use.Too bulky for indoor use.Way way way too heavy.Not a very good layout....
5,my favorite lens in my lineup,"So i've had this lens for about 2 months now and it is my favorite lens in my lineup.. it's the best 50mm lens you could buy and i have no trouble with focusing issues. the auto focus is fast and at f/1.2 it's highly useable. I also had the 85mm 1.2L and after a week of using both, i chose to keep the 50mm and returned the 85mm for a 70-200 2.8L IS. I recommend this lens to anyone willing the shell out the money for it, and whenever i let anyone try the lens out, they are immediately in love with it. although it's expensive i think it's worth every penny and am so glad i picked this lens up."
4,"Great lens, but a bit too expensive","This is a great lens with creamy smooth bokeh and fast low light performance. It focuses fast and silently. Although it's a bit heavy for a 50mm lens, it feels very well built and sturdy. I feel it's a bit too expensive, but if you like to shoot wide open with super smooth out of focus areas, this is a great lens.The 50mm field of view is very versatile for a prime. If I had to choose only one prime lens to use, this would be the one - it's among my favorites although the 85mm f1.2 is a gem too and seems to yield even better bokeh, especially for portraits.Amazon.com said ""usually ships within 1-2 months"" for this lens however they shipped my order of this lens within a couple of days after I placed the order, nice!"
4,Great lens,Pros:Great bokehlightweightcompact and beautiful designCons:ExpensiveNot as sharp as the 35L or the 85LNot as easy to use as other Canon prime lenses (but rewarding when learned how to use it)
3,Canon Brand VS other less cost 50mm brands?,Will I still get a good shot with half the price cut down? I know buying the real deal will get me the best withoutgiving me problems but at this moment I don't have the budget for this right now but will like the same or even close to the quality I could get.whats the best solution I can aim for?
5,The 50mm to keep.,"You have likely tried other 50mm lenses if you are considering this L. While I haven't shot the comparable Sigma, this lens far exceeds the capability, quality and build of the other three Canon versions (50 f/1.8 II, 50 f/1.4, and the 50 f/2.5 macro).Acceptably sharp at f/1.2 (although wide-open performance is not as great as the 85mm f/1.2L II lens), which immediately improves by f/1.8. My copy of this lens is amazingly sharp at f/2 and pretty fairly consistent through f/11 until suffering a little due to diffraction thereafter. Everything else is absolutely excellent -- color, saturation, contrast, bokeh, AF speed, build quality, etc.Definitely expensive, but if you like 50mm lenses I think it is the best-performing option for Canon users."
5,Amazing lens!,"This is one of my favorite lens beside 85mm f1.2 II. Razor sharp, this lens is great combo with 5DMKII."
5,Love it... but...,"The lens meets all my expectations, however, focusing at 1.2 at close distances is tricky. From a distance is not a problem, but within a few feet auto focus mis-focuses. I read that this is an issue and that manually focusing the lens when needing 1.2 at closer distances is best. But with such a nice expensive lens, that shouldn't be an issue. I thought about returning it, but alas decided not to because I was so happy with it otherwise."
3,It's a trade off...,"This is a gorgeous-looking lens, and is one of the best-built pieces of glass you can find. But if you're looking to upgrade from your 50mm f/1.4 or your f/1.8, read a few of my words first.First off, yes this lens is fast but it is also extremely soft wide open and softer than the 1.4 after the aperture falls below 1.8. Chromatic abberation is rather harsh for an L-lens (even harsher than the 1.8 and 1.4 non-L lenses) and the vignetting on a full-frame sensor is kind of disappointing. Yes this lens is sharp but the 1.4 and 1.8 are sharper and they cost a fraction of the price. However, the 1.2 is fantastically built and the low light capabilities are nice.If you have 1.4 and want to upgrade, upgrade to the 35mm f/1.4. If not, then keep it, and if you have the f/1.8, upgrade to the 50mm f/1.4, This lens is decent, but not worth the value at all."
5,amazing lens,"After using it, i have to say it is not sharp and have some focus problems with the mid point on 5d2however, the photos created by this lens with my 5d2 are truly great. I have the 85L II and have to say that some photos were very comparableAnd you do not need to step back too much to take a whole body photo compared to the 85L or 135Lhighly recommended"
5,Excellent series!,"I love this series. I have read 6 of the books so far and I hope there are more to follow...Ruth writes so wonderfully. You feel as if you are present in the lives of the characters. She takes you back in time and fills your heart with so many emotions.I love that her novels are Chritian based. I get so much inspiration from each book that I do not want to put them down. I feel lifted up and sooo enjoy her lessons taught :^)I enjoyed this first book tremendously, and loved reading the next ones even more... what makes them extra special is you get tidbits of information on past characters as the series goes on. We never loose touch with our beloved characters.Mrs. Hickman"
5,Adorable,This is very cute. Purchased it for my granddaughters Birthday and she was thrilled to have a Birthday Express Train.
2,Too small for the $$,"For $[...], the toy is really too small and its not worth the money we pay for this toy."
2,Quantum Chemistry in a not so accessible way,Although the book presents a deep exposition of the subject the want for clarity is almost overwhelming. Not many pictures and the extensive use of Dirac's notation makes it dense and a bit dull to read especially at the undergraduate level. This is in stark contrast with the author's excellent book 'Physical Chemistry'. The older and classic books explain things much better imho.This review refers to the 4th edition.
4,Remember !! Quantum CHEMISTRY not MECHANICS,"Want to know more about Quantum Mechanics? Then this is not the book for you. This book is about Quantum Chemistry!!! It's about SCF, MINDO, INDO and other alien-sounding acronyms. Buy this book only if you wish to know what goes on behind these ubiquitous GAUSSIAN and other computational chemistry softwares."
4,review of the quantum chemistry book fifth edition by Ira Levine,"This book is very well written until the section on many electron atoms and molecules, starting from the helium atom. The section on many electrons systems is not well written and is very ambiguous. It is not possible to follow the math that is written. The chapters of the book until this are very well written and could be understood easily. I don't know if the author himself is well familiar with the many electron systems mathematics or not or he intends to make it so unclear. In general this book is better than other quantum chemistry books that I have and with the only deficiency of the explanation of the many electron systems I think It is a good quantum chemistry."
3,good companion for the book,"having a B.S. in chemistry and now finishing a M.S. in chemistry, solutions manuals are always helpful when you are doing your homework and can't quite get to the answer on your own. this solutions manual is slightly less ""clear"" on the work to get to the answer but nonetheless has 85-90% of the work on the paper for you to follow. being quantum chemistry, it's a must buy because you're never going to know everything but with this you can try to better understand it."
2,Moony About Stripers,"It's ""different"" alright: too much earnest style and mysticism for the money. I have no doubt Abrames is a good fisherman and loves the striper and its world --but you gotta wade through the mucky prose of the post/neo Romantic style to get out to what Abrames knows. It is apparently meant to be EXPERIENCED --perhaps read by moonlight to a woman in an Edwardian dress in Blake meter. The doors of perception into the striper world swing open but it's still just a beach and saltwater and a primitive vertebrate from which I want to elicit a feeding response. The transcendental drawings ARE lovely, but they show less than meets the eye, and any one of the new primers of fly fishng for stripers are better esp. Taboury's ""Stripers on the Fly"" (Lyons/1999). This is waa-aaay too different."
4,Rhode Island Striper fisherman provides good philosophy,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is not a stand alone resource as many of these books are instruction manuals. It is more of an expression of opinion and observation, which I found refreshing. I think that some of the material was well detailed, including presentation and reading currents in different environments. Being an amature tyer, I was hoping for more visual instruction for some of the well know and productive flies."
5,Excellent Review of Tibetan Art,"This book provides an excellent historical review of developments in Tibetan art with many superb photographs. Its a very good introduction to the topic, but I would not say the writing tone is geared toward the layman. You'd really want to supplement this book with others that explain in more detail the iconography of the images."
5,Absolutely Heavy,"Just amazing this album if you really listen to it. Real ""soul"" music. He makes you beleive in something higher, profound, a sound embodiment of love, the real thing. This album is genius and one of my favorites. Curtis only got better with age. Curtis brought light into the world. He expressed it, he reflected it. He let others feel it."
5,Excellent!!!,"This album was beautiful. I've listened to Curtis for years (my father had all his albums.) I was born in the late seventies (1977), way after Curtis Mayfield made his mark in the music industry, yet I still feel his music. When he made ""We People Who Are Darker than Blue,"" he would of never guessed those same lyrics would apply to the 90's. And that song's remake on this current album made that point all the better. The best songs on this album, I would have to say are, ""The Girl Stays on My Mind"" and ""Here but I'm Gone."" The song ""The Girl Stays on My mind"" has the same feel of his old hit, ""The Makings of You."" Curtis Mayfield's whole style brought me back to the days when my parents would throw party's and my sisters and I would be in our rooms listening to our parents friends laugh and act a fool over Curtis Mayfield saying... ""If there's hell below...We're all gonna go!!!"" You gotta pick up the album for old time's sake. Keep keep'n it real. Sean C."
5,Balanced treatment,"Ron Campbell presents a balanced treatment of the subject from an evangelical Christian perspective with critical thinking, careful courtesy, and forthrightness. His long discourse on Egyptian links to freemasonry are insightful to understand the spiritual realities behind the organization. He lovingly presents a case to help a friend or relative help a loved one or even a Master Mason himself find their way out of the lodge."
2,Uncomfortable as hell.,It might just be my face who knows but the metal part of the sunglasses really bugged the hell out of me and rubbed and such. & within a week or so of having them the frame bent and the lens scratched.. :/ they were cute while they lasted i guess.
3,Average Rating,"This average book for the most part is good to use as a general reference. It is somewhat outdated and it uses California law for most of its examples so if you live in another state, you'll need to find out what the law is in YOUR state. The best parts of the book are the practice exercises at the end of each chapter in which you use the disk provided. This gives ""hands-on"" experience."
4,Great information easy to understand book,"I am currently taking a class and we're using this book so I rented it from amazon. My class is online and I read the book without the teacher's instructions, what I mean is that is a very easy book to read and understand. I will be keeping this book with me, it is a valuable item if you want to get a good grasp of legal procedures with an easy read."
3,Legal Procedures,"It's an OK book, the author should try to stick to one field of law. The Author should make it into a series, since it has Criminal, Civil, Wills & Trusts, Family Law, etc., I haven't (have not) finished reading the entire book. The Author should be more thorough when writing about ""point and authorities."" The Author should discribe how to fix the brackets plus the number magins to left and right."
4,Protec Trumpet Case Review,"My son really likes the case. It's light-weight and smaller than a standard trumpet case. The shoulder strap makes it easier to carry, especially on and off bus. Only drawback is that the pockets are not large enough to hold music."
4,Good solution for daily use,"I had purchased another soft-sided case for my son that seemed to work well but resulted in a dent in the trumpet since it didn't have reinforcement. My son's trumpet teacher suggested this as an alternative since it is still lighter than a hard case and offers a hard shell liner for better protection. Though it's almost twice the price as the original soft case that I purchased, the hard shell liner is worth the extra expense. The extra weight is negligible compared to the older soft sided case that didn't have reinforcement. It also comes with a shoulder strap which, surprisingly, is not included in the other higher priced soft cases that I looked at."
4,Nice Compact Case,Very compact and portable case. Nice for just carrying around your trumpet. A bigger side pocket would be nice though.
3,New to RS? Buy it!! Old hand? Nothing you don't already know,"If you don't have Gaston's Vol 1-3 (now out of print), this is a must buy. Sadly, it is limited to Reinhold's red mark items (both marked and unmarked)and contains no new molds or decorations. A change of format for a Gaston book as items are divided by decoration rather then type of object. Values are with each photo, a nice change! For the experiences collector there is nothing new, but if you don't have the first three books by Gaston, you will find much to appreciate in this volume. Avid ""red mark"" collectors will enjoy having so much,all in one source."
3,For Readers interested in the Crusades & Medieval Times,At first it wasn't what I had hoped for. I would have preferred more/better graphics. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about the Crusades you might like it but it's not for a first time read. Check around.
4,Heard it is a great item but Amazon couldn't get me one.,"I ordered the item because of the rave reviews I saw about it. I even bought a Makita table saw used locally... Well, I am stuck with a saw I can't really use very well because Amazon could not provide me with the kit.I was shipped the outfeed table and my order was then marked 'order shipped in full', NOT.I was really not impressed with Amazon's ability to get the items. Oh well...Don't know how to rate the item, but I have heard so much good stuff and the one item I did get was first class, so I give it a four."
4,Very Nice,I bought these to store and preserve old family photos. They are really nice and easy to load. I like that I can put them in any standard binder.
1,This book SUCKS,"No wonder it's 97 cents. I think the authors were paid by the word because it is so over-written. For a town of 63,000 people, the insider's guide should not be this thick. Please. For example, the authors go into lengthy (but useless) detail about the MALL: ""Next door to Stride-Rite, which offers a wide variety of footwear, you'll find Spencer's, with a plethora of ecclectic gifts for everyone on your shopping list."" I'm making that up, but that's about how ridiculous it is. Hello, it's a MALL. An ""insider's guide"" should not give a crap about what's at the mall, much less devote page after page to it."
5,they did these right!!!,"hadn't seen these since i was 8 or so!the transfers are excellent--no glitches,digital smudges,or anything!crisp,clear,wholesome entertainment!claymation fans:this is a must-have!"
1,Stay away from wide-neck!,"We received the wide-neck started kit and they were awful! They leaked all down our baby's chin, which is horrible when you're fedding him in the middle of the night. We ended up buying the Playtex VentAire and have been quite happy with them--but our baby has never been particularly gassy. I have a friend who swears by the standard size Dr. Brown's, but I had such an awful experience with the wide-neck that I don't think I'll try another type of Dr. Brown's."
1,Not what I hoped for,"I bought these bottles thinking they were neat and inovative. Well, to my surprise they leaked like crazy. You can't make a powder formula bottle in them at all because that's when they leak. There are also too many parts to clean and you have to make sure you don't lose the little brush they include w/ the kit. I ended up throwing the bottles in the garbage and purchased the very inexpensive evenflo 3 pack instead. Much better. :)"
5,I wouldn't use anything else!,"My mother works in a day care and told me about these bottles when I was pregnant. It seems that the babies that use Dr. Brown's bottles in the day care spit up less and have less stomach problems. Although I was given other brands of bottles as baby shower gifts, I never used them. My baby has never had a problem with gas or spitting up and I like to think that it's the bottles that make the difference. My husband has spoken to mothers and fathers that complain about their babies stomach problems and the medications that they have been given that does not seem to help. Hubby answers by giving them a Dr. Brown's bottle and people are amazed at the difference. I would recommend these bottles to anyone."
4,Fantastic product,"I used this web site to research bottles, and saw all of these great reviews, so I registered for this bottle system. And I have been very happy with it. I have only tried one other bottle, one of the angled neck styles, and my daughter was much more gassy with that. I will warn you, it is a little more work than other bottles, just because there are multiple parts, but it is worth it. It was either this or the systems that use the bags, but I didn't want to have to keep buying bags, and risk running out. The hardest part is explaining to other people how it works!"
5,These bottles are the best,"We have tried many other brands, but nothing compares to this one. The unique design really works -- no gas, no colicky baby. Nothing else works as great. Although it takes a little more effort to clean, but it is worthwhile. We like it."
4,"They are more work ,but seem to work well","I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal. I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak. There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a ""travel disc"" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems. I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!"
5,Wonderful invention,"These are the best purchase I have made for my daughter. They are wonderful bottles that cured my daughter's gas and spit up problems!In response to other reviews, you need to not fill it up pass the DO NOT FILL line in order for them not to leak--although I have never had a problem with any leakage.These bottles are absolutely THE BEST. My daughter is now one and is still using Dr. Brown's. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Best bottle in the world,"When my baby was 2wks old she developed excessive gas and was very cranky, she would not allow me to put her down at all. I bought a 2oz Dr. Brown bottle and fed her that night. She has not suffered with excessive gas since and is a much happier baby. I truly recommend Dr Brown bottles!"
5,Great Bottles!!!,"My son was born seven weeks early, and was bottle-fed in the NICU. When he came home, we had a few frustrating days trying to find a bottle he liked. These bottles are great! They are the only ones I could find that offered a preemie nipple. The other bottles drowned him, but these were just right!"
5,"Great bottle, average nipple, try one from Playtex Ventaire!","We went through a number of bottles with our 1 month old before we all (myself, my wife and our daughter) came to a conclusion that this is the bottle of choice! This could be specific to our baby's taste, but she prefers formula to stay in the bottle unless she wants it out! The only nipple that does not drip on gravity we found was from Playtex VentAire bottles. But the bottles themselves were a pain, we could never get those bottoms to work correctly. So we tried Dr. Browns. These bottles work very smoothly, never a vacuum (BIG problem with Playtex) or a bubble (also happened with Playtex). And the best part... Playtex nipples, the ones with three small cuts, which you have to squeeze to express formula, fit it very well! Of course both Dr Browns and Playtex manuals say to only use their nipples with their bottles, but well... of course they won't tell you to buy competitor product! They just work together, and work very very well!"
5,Happy with Doctor Browns!,"These bottles are great. I agree with the other reviewers. They do take some time to clean, but it is well worth it. I too have never had any problem with leakage ... just make sure you use the ""travel disk"" under the nipple. The one time I was in a rush and forgot it, I did get a minor leak. My 3 month old, a spit-up queen :), does much better with these. She still spits up every now and then, but it's not as bad as the other brand of bottles I tried. Keep in mind that this cool system won't ELIMINATE ALL gas, bubbles, burping, etc., but they sure are a cut above the others."
3,Different isn't necessarily better...,"I registered for these bottles on the advice of a friend. I was doing breast and bottle feed, and my son took to this bottle easily, with no confusion.However, he was diagnosed with a reflux problem, so it has been difficult for us to see the benefits of these bottles. I cannot tell you if they help to reduce gas bubbles or not.With that said, you should know that these bottles are high maintenance. There are many parts to the bottle: the bottle itself, nipple, collar, air tube and a green ""contraption"" for the seal. Each part has to be washed, and the tube and seal have to be washed with a very small bottle brush (smaller than the diameter of a ball point pen).My suggestion is not to be ""sold"" on these bottles alone. Buy a small pack, compare them to other bottles after a feed. If they work for your baby (all babies are different), then they are well worth the cleaning work. IF you don't see much of a difference, find an easier bottle to clean and maintain."
5,Genius,This is pure genius. You can't buy an album with more inspiration. Jeff Beck has put together one of his best albums again. It's hard to describe how great it is in words. One can only listen to it and enjoy.
5,Why is this not on the radio as Grammy Award winner?,"If you don't own this, play LOOSE CANNONS for 10 seconds to find out all you need to know about the cd. IT should be titled JUST LISTEN, cause that's all you need to do. This is not jazz, not the rockabilly cd he did 20 yrs ago, this is hard rock done by a master guitarman! I have no doubt that a blackbirdstopped at his windowsill while he was plugged in, applauded with his own tweetstyle, and Jeff answered back. I'm sure this is what inspired Blackbird. That bird flew higher & more majestically than usual that day. I'm also quite sure that 4 birds showed up the next day at the same time, just like we do. You don't have to be a birdbrain to know you need this CD, just listen..."
3,Mediocre,"I was somewhat disappointed by this CD. When I heard Beck's rendition of ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"" with Imogen Heap, I thought this CD would be fantastic. Instead, I found a CD that was more electronic rock than rock or blues with heavy use of the drum kit. Most of the songs didn't have any melody."
3,A SHORT ONE,THIS IS ONE OF JEFF BECKS BEST DISC FROM START TO FINISH BUT IT IS ONLY 35 MINUTES LONG. I LOVE THE VERSION OF ROLLIN & TUMBLIN.I WOULD GIVE THIS DISC A 4 1/2 IF IT WAS LONGER.
2,NO -NO,This is not the Jeff Beck I learned to love!!! Where in this CD can I find something that sounds like one of the greatest modern guitarists in the world??? Jeff ..get back to the basics...let me hear those magic fingers again!!!!
4,come again,"not a big techno fan, but after seeing THE MAN live, supporting both recent albums, i'm amazed !!! live is the way to go. a bit more ""mellow"" but excellent as usual. about his ""abscense"" lets not forget his playing with roger waters ""amused to death"" work on the cars jeff, but please remember the folks who really appreciate guitar playing at the highest level! hopeing for mr becks music forever!!!!!!"
5,"Jeff Beck's ""You Had It Coming"" Among the Best","Jeff Beck's hammering, dive-bomber solos are still among the best in rock. The best examples of this are 'Earthquake' and 'Dirty Mind.' 'Roy's Toy,' the album's groove oriented dance track, also features a noteworthy solo and a riff to match.He creates an emotional and beautiful image in 'Nadia'. The song possesses a sensual legato technique and a melody that will make you melt in ecstasy. The emotion he portrays in his playing will bring you out of your body, and Beck seems to really put a lot of himself into You Had It Coming, and 'Nadia' especially. No track is emotionless here.This is not only Beck's most daring album in a career delineated by ground-breaking releases, it also contains some of his best playing yet. If Beck decides to take another long sabbatical, You Had It Coming has given fans further proof that Jeff Beck is always worth the wait."
2,Jeff Beck - You had it coming,"I loved blow by blow. As a Jeff Beck fan I thought wow. I did have it coming. However, what is with all that very hard rock. Could barely hear his wonderful guitar. What a shame. To loud, and to hard. Sorry Jeff!"
3,Mr. Prolific Strikes Again!,"Don't get me wrong, I have followed Jeff from the days of the Tridents through to ""Who Else."" Jeff, who looks younger than ever, is becoming quite prolific in his old age. Jeff released ""There And Back"" in 1980 and then kept us all waiting some 6 or 7 years for his return to form. His true return to form did not happen until the release of ""Who Else.""Jeff has done the whole fusion thing and needs to reinvent himself again. I think Jeff is quite complacent fixing his old hot rods these days and does not see a reason to ""mess"" with the formula.Jeff works best when you feel he is about to go off the edge and make a major mistake - which he rarely ever does. Jeff is the king of all British guitarists. I miss the Jeff of old and especially the Yardbirds days; the last time Jeff really showed what he was capable of doing in a short tasteful solo.I have already rushed out and added this to my Jeff collection. How about a few bars of ""High Ho Silver Lining then Jeff?"""
1,You Had It Coming,"Jeff Beck's new CD, along with his previous effort, are classic examples of a great guitarist who has allowed some mediocre ""musicians"" to destroy his talents.I can alwys spot music that has been surgically chopped up by ""PRO TOOLS"" computer programme. Jeff ! What were you thinking ? Find yourself a SINGER/songwriter who you can bounce off of , & resume making MUSIC again ! This new CD gave me a headache....."
5,Great CD,This is a great CD. Beck fans who want Blow by Blow over and over are just stuck in time. Jeff is not. Buy this now.
3,"Sporadically marvelous, too harsh","I am a long time Jeff Beck fanatic. I have listened to this album repeatedly, and tried to like it wholeheartedly. But I can't. With the exceptions of quiet, shimmeringly beautiful, haunting ""Suspension"", and ""Nadia"", an exotic Indian song (in which Jeff bends too many notes),every track is harsh and repetitious. Jeff's genius is obvious and his pushing of the sonice envelope should be applauded. CLapton would never take chances like this. But what's missing is balance and structure."
5,If you Love Tango,"This is a wonderful CD. The choice of titles is perfect and the production is excellent. I Salonisti have a special sound that stirs the imagination. It is glamorous and rich and brings to mind an era of wealth and innocence that is hard to describe. I think any lover of the Art Deco movement will enjoy this music. Needless to say, the very sound of tango exudes romance!"
1,Lifetime warranty useless,"I purchased 3 network surge protectors from APC with a lifetime warranty and after about 4 months one stopped working. I had it properly grounded but a surge came through the line and burnt out a switch. Thankfully it didn't travel any further in my network. I contacted APC to obtain an exchange an they were very friendly and told me that I would receive one in 5 to 7 days. Great! I was ready to hop on Amazon to order another 3 despite having the surge frying my switch that was located after the properly grounded network surge protector. I decided to wait until I received the replacement before placing my order. Well, I'm glad I did! After 4 months of calling them about every 2 weeks I get the same story,... The product isn't in stock, then they give me a date about 2 weeks out when it will be shipped. In 2 weeks it's the same story! It has been over 4 months at this point! Next call December 2nd! I will never purchase another APC product!"
1,Didn't work for me,"Bought this and installed it between my Wifi radio transceiver and my router.Lightning storm came through Saturday night. . . the lightning arrester on the tower saved the Wifi radio (it works fine) but this ""surge protector"" let through enough current to kill the Internet side of my WRT54G router. Router still powers on, but can't see the ""Internet"" connection. This is what happened to its predecessor, WITHOUT a ""surge protector"" to protect it. So I wasted $25 on this product.I came back here wondering if there was any kind of guarantee, but I guess I'm out the cost of a router AND my $25 for this ineffective device. I feel betrayed after trusting the APC name."
3,Easy set up - but not for outdoor use,It's about as easy as it comes to install the thing. One might expect a lightning suppressor to work outside. I did at least. But this one shorted out the first drizzle we got. Even mounting it vertically so any water would drain out.
1,Not what I expected,I ordered this CD thinking it was a software program that my children could use on the computer. But it's not. It is a CD to listen to. There is no way teenagers will benefit from this product.
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"I was hoping that this tape would be a compilation of actual Dan Quayle bloopers.Instead this is a bunch of lame comedy routines poking fun of Dan Quayle. I threw it out after one viewing. Plus, it is only about 30 minutes long. Avoid this like the plague."
4,Very funny,"Granted, picking on Dan Quayle's intelligence is fairly easy, but this video is hilarious. Unless you're an extremely partisan Republican, it will deeply disturb you that this birdbrain got within a heartbeat of becoming President. It was well worth the few dollars I spent on it."
4,Farkle with a twist,We have played Farkle for several years and actually had made up our own version of Spicy Farkle for a change. This game is great when you really just need to unwind and any number of people can play. Great family game! We created a program on our laptop to keep score since that is the hardest part of the game.
4,Fun Farkel Twist,"My wife's family has been playing Farkel for a long time, and this new twist on the game definitely added to the entertainment value. If you have played Farkel before, you can play Spicy Farkel as the basic rules of the game haven't changed, just the point values. The gameplay involves the rolling of six dice to score points, and the Spicy Frakel twist is each die has a red side which can potentially multiply your score on that individual roll. Farkel is super easy to play, and you aren't limited by a total player amount. The hardest part of this game is adding up the potentially large point totals in your head during a player's turn. Because of this math, I gave the educational value two stars.Overall Spicy Farkel is a nice mix-up to boardgames and cards, so if you are looking for a spicy twist, give it a shot."
3,a bit too sensationalist,"i expected this documentary to feature more facts about the life and ecology of coyote habitat, but it discussed very little that was relevant to solving the problem of predation. if it did, it was a but dated in my eyes. i raise sheep and fight coyotes constantly and am always exploring options and strategies to defend the flock.i was hoping to use this as a way to communicate with others who hate/ aggressively hunt them. i dont think it will change anyones mind. it sensationalizes the hunting contest thing to point of distraction from the point trying to be made."
4,Got exactly what expected so far,"Bought this air intake for my mother for her Mustang GT and she loves it. Noticed a better throttle response and better power in the higher RPM just as the paperwork they send with the product suggests. Was relatively easy to install, took about an hour, but could do the next one faster. Haven't asked her if the fuel economy has changed, but my mom tends to drive pretty heavy footed and enjoys driving her car. Overall I am a big K&N fan and install their air intakes on most all my vehicles. Filters are easy to clean and last as long as I own my vehicles easily. Also usually adds a nice deeper throatier sound to the exhaust inside and outside the vehicle."
4,Sequential not Simultaneous,"I have the previous model and this one seems to perform as well. The only confusion is that it charges sequentially not simultaneously. So, while it can charge two batteries, it charges one and then the other rather than doing both at the same time."
1,Grout removal,The carbide grout blade wear out too fast. I went thru three carbide blades just to remove grout from a shower stall area.
2,multimaster carbide blades,"While the MultiMaster worked very well in cutting out old windows, I found that the metal and carbide blades wear out very quickly when cutting through the metal casement frames and plaster with the carbide blades. Because they are so expensive, I decided to buy the Harbor Freight version whose carbide blades also wear out quickly but are only $12 compared to $50+ for Fein blades. The blades are not interchangeable and the harbor freight oscillating tool worked really well for the $39 I paid for it. (only used it for cutting wood and plaster.) I will try taking the $12 blades to someone with a plasma cutter to see if I can get them to work on the MultiMaster. Great tool, just too expensive to keep buying blades. If you really want to buy these, it is a much better buy than buying each one separately."
4,A great text editing product,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this release. I had used Acrobat years ago and always found it lacking compared to Microsoft Word. However, it has surpassed most of Word's capabilities. The ability to generate a document that people can edit directly, with only acrobat reader installed has helped me significantly in my multi-platform work environment.The only thing missing is a true index capability. The lack of that feature would significantly hamper anyone who wanted to use this to generate true documentation."
3,Bad License Policy,"Good upgrade in terms of features. Essential for Vista. However, the license policy ignores modern life. Most business workers have 3 machines: 1) a desktop at work, 2) a desktop at home, and 3) a portable for travel. The license permits only two installations, which Adobe monitors. According to Adobe customer service, you can always buy a second license. I'm sure that spending the extra money will make you feel really good about Adobe. Even Microsoft recognizes modern life and permits 3 installations."
1,Buggy,I am not happy with this software. For no reason I can understand it will duplicate a line on the document so that you have two identical lines of the document right under each other. Also it will duplicate part of the top of the document at the bottom. This only seems to happen when you create multi page PDF files. This makes it virtually unusable for me. The features though look great.
5,"Gold Thomas, Silver Percy, Bronze Diesel","You can't go wrong with THomas trains and these are great because of their unique color, collector's edition elements. My boys love and play with them a lot."

5,Great Statue,I bought this as a gift for my husband. Super fast shipping. The picture shown doesn't do it much justice. Awesome details. It is a beautiful statue! If you collect statues this is the one to have!!!!!
5,Great Level & A Must for Framers,"I purchased this level for a few projects of my own including finishing a basement. I used to use the good old plumb bob to get walls straight and true and even with experience it would still take much too long. This level eliminates the need for the good old bob and helps you get walls straight and true in a matter of a minutes. I also like the solid feel and construction of Stabila levels. They really are very well built and this level even at its length is no exception. Lastly, it would be nice if a level of this price came with a bag but I will not let that detract from the product itself. Just be aware you might want to pick up a bag or case to store and transport your level. Otherwise, this is a solid piece of equipment that's a must for anyone framing anything!"
3,Fabulous,"This is the second book in Catherine Palmer's 'Treasure of the Heart' series. After meeting the Thornton family in the first book, Palmer moves on to tell the story of Jessica Thornton and her son Splinter. After having inherited a house on Zanaibar, Jessica moves there from England looking for a better life for her and her son. There she meets her long-lost husband and sparks fly.One of the best features of this book is that some chapters are written from Splinter's point of view. These prove to be REALLY funny as he views situations in a much different way to his mother.I don't think that this book is as good as the first book. It took me awhile to get into this book and some of the characters were not developed as much as I would have liked them to be. Catherine Palmer is my favourite christian writer and I would recommend any of her books."
4,Fast moving and well written,All three books in this series by Catherine Palmer are fun to read with Africa as an interesting setting. She describes the land so well it is the unspoken character in the books. The human characters each struggle in realistic ways to surrender their wills and faults to Christ. I really enjoyed this series and would recommend it.A Touch of Betrayal (Treasures of the Heart Series #3)A Kiss of Adventure (Treasures of the Heart Series #1)it.
3,Some Problems,"It's a huge book, over 600 pages but there are a few problems.1. A lot of years are skipped. For instance Upper Deck '92 is missing as well as '96 through '98. Every manufacturer seems to be missing years whether it be Donruss, Fleer, Ultra, Score, Stadium Club. You name it. A lot of traded series are also missing.2. Don't plan on using this as a reference guide for any length of time because the pages start falling out practically the moment it first opened.The solution for Beckett is simple. Don't include every card. Over half of the 1991 Score series is 2 cent cards. Just state that unlisted cards are 2 cents and you'd save yourself a couple of pages. The book would literally be half the size or less and then Beckett could include more sets."
2,Don't Buy,"I think Beckett gets worse and worse every year. I am so upset with their magazines and their books. This books skips so many years. For example there is no Donruss 1991-2000 cards listed at all. Majority of my cards are those ones. So this book become very useless to me. It's just like their magazine they skip everything. I haven't been able to find a book yet that will tell me what the price of all my cards are. If you have any special insert cards, this book will not list them."
5,AWESOME,I had this CD once and lost it and glad to get it back and it is a GREAT workout CD to do exercise with.... It was in GREAT shape.... thank you!
3,Not As Good As It Gets for Keyes,"I am a big fan of Marian Keyes, having read all of her novels (I am 3/4 of the way through the most recent, The Other Side of the Story). As other reviewers have noted, this novel took a long time to get going,and, in my opinion, neither of Keyes' heroines are as real or interesting as those in her other novels. For me, Keyes is the most effective when using first person narration. The use of third person in this novel distanced me further from the characters, one of whom was too evil and the other too sweet. In her next novel (Other Side) Keyes uses multiple points of view more effectively. On the other hand, I thought Keyes's development of the male characters in this novel was better than in some of her others. What I would really like to know is when does the next Walsh sister novel come out? I really want to hear how Helen's detective agency works out!"
3,Okay- Last Chance was her best,Not my favorite by any means. The best parts where the last 5 chapters. I will try her new book and hope it perks my interest. THis one did not
3,I am still a fan,"Well- let me start out with saying that this is not the first Marion Keys book that I have read, and this one was not the homerun that the others were. She is still a fabulous author, and the book is humorous and emotionally revealing, but I was hoping for a little more. I wish that she would write something out of her normal ""fashion editor, all style and name brand"" iconic settings. She has got a real way of revealing characters, and writing a story that is smooth and a pleasure to read. It's just time that she changed it up a bit.If you have never read one of her books, this one is a good place to start. She writes to women, and you will wind up loving the characters. I will always be a fan."
3,"Enjoyable... a fun, light read.","This was my first Keyes novel and although the summary is somewhat misleading, the book and story itself are pretty entertaining.The characters all have flaws, but yet somehow Keyes makes them likable. I don't know how, but she makes you invest in and care for the characters and still want to smack them upside the head. That said, I wound up feeling very satisfied with the ending and definitely interested in reading more of Keyes writing.While I was reading it my husband told me how much he enjoyed watching me read a book that made me laugh and smile so much. So, if you like to laugh and smile while you read, pick this one up."
3,Disappointed Keyes Fan!,"If you are a fan of Marian Keyes work, as I am, you may want to skip this book. (I can't believe I just typed that!)I found the subject matter in ""Sushi"" to be compelling, but Keyes just didn't give me any interesting characters! There was no one to cheer for. I didn't even care enough about Ashling to be on her side when she was getting jerked around! It may have had something to do with the way the book erratically skips around between their stories, never giving the reader time to bond or relate to any one character.It's a shame because I felt character development had been one of Keyes strongest talents.The Bottom Line: Make your way through Keyes' other books first!"
2,I never thought I'd say this about a Marian Keyes book but..,I didn't like it! And I LOVE Marian Keyes and all her books so far. I found Sushi for Beginners incredibly boring and had a hard time liking any of the characters. I'll keep my fingers crossed for her next one!
3,Pool Read,"Lovely story, easy to read pool-side holiday book. First time for Marian Keys for me - and I will read another."
1,Not for me,"I really couldn't get into reading this book. For me, it was boring but I would try to read another book by this author at some point."
4,Ok read!,This book starts really slow; it took me about 250 pages to get into it. Great ending though!
4,3 Irish women search for happiness,"Keyes takes us into the lives of 3 modern Dublin women and their search for eternal happiness. She writes some of the best chick-lit that's being published, and this is a goodie to add to the genre's bookshelves. These three women work for Colleen, a trendy women's magazine. One is a chronic worrier, one is a tyrant, and one is too domestic for words. Stir them up and put a Prada bag in the middle of the table, and watch them turn into children squabbling over who gets the Gucci wallet."
4,"What happens AFTER ""happily ever after""","A nice change from run-of-the-mill chick lit, ""Sushi"" features a fresh setting in Dublin, a nice trio of not-cloyingly-cute characters, and most refreshing of all, a glimpse at what happens after the ""happily ever after,"" i.e. family and kids. The daily drudgery of motherhood and married life for even a gorgeous gal married to a perfect man is a nice corrective to all the puffery about ""having it all"" out there, without ranging too far into nightmarish Kate Reddy territory. Not especially well written or plotted, but readable, fun and engaging."
3,"If u are new to Marian, don't start here...","Read ""The Other Side of the Story"" first, it's excellent. While ""Sushi"" kept me turning pages due to Marian's storytelling abilities, there was no real story here that I felt invested in. Pass on this read and try one of her other highly rated books."
3,"Diverting and enjoyable but, like much sushi, it's a fictional meal that won't fill you up","Sushi for Beginners focuses on two women in Dublin. Ashling is an Irish girl who lands a job on a start-up fashion magazine, and Lisa is a fashion editor sent from London to manage it who'd been expecting a promotion to New York. These characters don't have the depth Keyes manages in several later books, and despite some streaks of seriousness, the plot remains on the chick-lit froth rather than exploring the dark side of the rag-trade magazines or rampant careerism. Diverting and enjoyable but, like much sushi, it's a fictional meal that won't fill you up."
3,Nothing to Rave About,"This is my first experience reading Marian Keyes. The book did start out slow. The character development was much better in the second half of the book. There were a couple of times when I couldn't put it down and I did enjoy it, over all but, it was nothing to rave about. I will read another Marian Keyes book and hope for better."
3,Some sad characters,I picked this book up in the hopes that the title referred to some food writing. This book has nothing to do with food. The characters rarely even eat. Having said that......The female characters in this book seem to have the same responses to the crisis in their lives. Although the two women are very different. There are some cute moments in the book but I didn't find it to be a page turner.
3,a good read,"this is the third marian keyes book that i read and i enjoyed it, just like ""lucy sullivan is getting married"" and ""angels"". it got a bit dragging in the middle but there were 'moments' that turned the story around. i just hope there was something more with regard to ashling and lisa's relationship as it appeared they were the ""stars"" of this book. admittedly, i lost interest in clodagh even though i sympathized with her. what i hope to have a juicier spin-off is the jack devine angle, culminating with his relationship with ashling.in sum, this is not great as in GREAT but it's a good read. in fact, i've always dreamt of putting up my own magazine in the future and the plot of this book really inspired me to pursue it."
3,"I normally LOVE Marian Keyes, but...","this book dragged on FOREVER. I kept at it, thinking, ""It's Marian Keyes, it's gotta get better!"" Alas, it was slow throughout. I liked the premise, I liked the characters, but I was happy when the story was over."
4,Great holiday or airplane read!,"Marian Keyes has a large following. This Irish author presents an interesting weave of characters and fashions a fine tapestry of lives that cover the spectrum: Character ego, courage, depression, deceit, infidelity, and loyal friendships make this an interesting book. The text does build into adult content and language.The book is filled with Irish/Brit wit and flair. You'll enter the fashion magazine world and find some fine female characters along with the drama and growth that accompanies the human condition and any type of relationship.Recommended."
2,A cruel waste of time,"Up until SFB, I have always enjoyed Keyes' novels. This one did not live up to her previous efforts however. In fact, I was thoroughly dismayed that it took her so many, many pages to tell such a flat-out boring story with flat, two-dimensional characters. If you've never read Keyes before, may I suggest the fantastic Watermelon or Last Chance Saloon. These two are her best, and leaps and bounds better than SFB.At the end of SFB, I felt like I didn't know anyone, and what little I did know, I didn't much care for. Major disappointment and well below Ms. Keyes' previous talents."
3,Borrow it from the library,This book was alright...definitely wasn't the best I've read. This was actually the first Marian Keyes that I've read. The only interesting story/plotline in my opinion was the one that revolved around Ashling. Lisa was too annoying and Clodagh was someone you hated more and more. I recommend this to people 14 years or older because of a lot of swearing and some sexual content.
2,Audiobook is read terribly,"I really couldn't get through the audiobook. The readers whom I suppose is Keyes' daughter read slowly with such a thick Irish accent that most of the 4 chapters I struggled through were a torture. I really wasn't sure what was happening, if anything at all, and finally put it down and went for This Charming Man read by Sil Bermingham, who as a professional reader does a bang up job. Perhaps for Sushi, reading is a better option."
4,an engrossing and endearing read,"I have read several Marian Keyes books, and I have to say that I think this is her best one. Her writing has progressed over several novels, and while I really liked her earlier books, I think this one has better character development and dialogue. Our heroine, Ashling, is a charming character, and she is totally believable in her romantic woes. I also thought Jack, her lead male character, was really well developed in this novel too--a bit of a Mr. Darcy type! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a light, well-written romantic comedy."
1,VERY DULL!,"I TRIED MARIAN KEYES BASED UPON A RECOMMENDATION. THIS WAS JUST AS BORING AS 'LAST CHANCE SALOON'. I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO FINISH EITHER OF THESE BOOKS. THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL SO ANNOYING, YOU DON'T GET ATTACHED TO ANYONE & THEY AREN'T BOOKS YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THE GLOWING REVIEWS, THESE BOOKS ARE SO BORING."
1,Talk about falling flat on your face...,"I am so glad to see other people disliked this book. Normally, I loved Keyes' work as much as the next person, but not only was this book flater than a manhole cover, Keyes' attempt to somewhat mimic Helen Fielding's style was absolutely disastorous. My only hope is that Keyes' thought that this style would attract more readers, but my advice is to stick with the Walsh sisters. The old adage rings true- 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Unfortunally for Keyes, this absolutely hideous novel has completely undermined all of her writings for me, and has made me quite hesitant to pick up anything new by her (should she dare to write it). I really do hate to see such a sarcastic and humorous writer go by the wayside, but fellow readers be warned, a rebound from this book for Keyes would be astounding and a modern miracle at best, and a brave attempt to save face at worst."
5,I loved it!!!,"This book was so enjoyable to read that I was sorry to see it end. Others have commented that it could have been shorter, but I do not agree. I thought by the end of the book your really knew each person and saw how they evolved during the story. Jack was totally Devine! I got so into this story that I actually had sushi for lunch today!!!!This book was better than the Other Side of the Story. All chicklit fans will enjoy this one."
3,"Slow, but good.","Overall this book was a decent read. It was slow and long winded in getting to a very predictable ending, but still managed to hold my interest."
3,Somewhat Real,"I thought it was interesting to read about ""life"" in Dublin. It started a little slow and I found the friendship, which is claimed to occur between the three women, didn't actually occur. Nor does the domestic housewife work for Colleen magazine. (someone referred to this in one of the reviews.) I liked the way the characters developed into wiser people, at the end of the book, but it gave very little reason why it was happening to Lisa. Perhaps her experience was so humbling? Perhaps it was the lack of badger-like competition around her? Who knows???It did, however, work into a very real aspect of these women's lives. There were real consequences for what they did, revelations and a possibility for a good future.Angels is on the agenda next. I wonder what will be similar and what will be different. I checked it out from the library rather than purchasing it this time, though. ;-)"
3,Another irish-based novel about 3 women...,"Although I enjoyed the first Marian Keyes novel I read (the other side of the story) I was a little dissapointed to discover that whilst this book is written with as much skill and passion as ""other side..."" it seems to follow a similar outline to it: 3 women, all with similar situations to this book. Ashling has problems which stem from her mother (Gemma), Lisa is a sucessful high flyer (Jojo) and Clogagh has a picture perfect life but feels worthless on the inside (Lily). It addresses issues such as adultery, divorce, depression and many more, but all which are addressed in her other books.I love your style Marian, but give us something new and different! Show us versatility that only good authors can provide!"
2,Light entertainment but won't keep your attention,"I read this book by the poolside during a vacation and it was ok material for that scenario, but I've read better. There's a lot of good fluff vacation reading and this would not be in that category. I didn't become involved in any of the characters enough to care what happened to them. Their personalities kept changing and it just felt like a mishmash of ideas of the writer rather than well developed fluff. I recommened The Devil Wears Prada over this book."
1,Not her best,"I have read several of Marian Keyes' other books and really liked them. This one, however, was such a drag I couldn't even finish it. The characters seemed too unreal to me and the storyline was very slow. Try one of her other books instead."
5,I'm a fan!,I love Marian Keyes books. They are thought-provoking and intelligent and funny. In this story there are three very good female characters and I enjoyed reading about all of their lives. I wouldn't recommend you to read this first if you're not already a Keyes fan. I would probably recommend 'Watermelon' or 'Lucy Sullivan is getting married' which are her earlier works. But if you're a die-hard fan like me you'll love this one too!
5,So much fun!,"I had such a good time reading this book. It is definitely an easy, quick read, but it's entertaining and I just loved it. I had previously read another book by this author and didn't like it at all, so I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting this story was."
4,You can't go too wrong with Marian Keyes,"Sushi for beginners was good, but I definitely preferred Rachel's Holiday, Angels, and The Other Side of the Story. Still, you can't go wrong with Marian Keyes. Her books are always entertaining, and her characters are always interesting."
3,Comprehensive description of cultivars,The book contains a good description of Dogwood cultivars. I found it useful for identification purposes. Pathologies affecting Cornus are also well described. On the other hand I found that cultural techniques are insufficiently addressed.
3,"Good, thorough, but not thorough enough!","It's a great book for plant geeks and more casual gardners as well. Unfortunately, I think it's written from the perspective of a Southern gardner, so the information is often very much slanted to dogwwod growers from the South and to a lesser extent, the East Coast. I live in the Pacfic NW and I was looking for some in-depth information on our native dogwoods, the Pacific Flowering Dogwood and Bunchberry (Red Osier dogwood is hard to kill here so I didn't need too much help with it). Their discussion of the Pacific Dogwood is very brief, taking up about one page. Same goes for Bunchberry. With both species, they determine that they're very hard to grow in the South. Oh well, it's still a good book with lots of good information and beautiful photos. If you are a fan of the Eastern and Asian dogwood varieties, this is the book for you!"
4,Bigger Than I Thought,"Well, it may take me 5 years to read it, but it's supposed to be a classic, and I have tackled bigger. I started last night, and so far so good, did 20 pages. A lot of info, but I know I will get through it."
5,A terrific tool for exploring this work,"I don't speak Japanese, so I can't enter into the discussion of who is the better translator. However, this version was gripping and eminently readable. At first, I couldn't even tell who was who or what they were doing with and to each other, but eventually, with the help of the various apparatuses provided by the translator and some outside reading, I was able to follow the action. I can't imagine that it would have been possible, or at least as rewarding, without all the guides and footnotes and chapter headings and glossaries and maps, etc.The effort was well worth it. The society and the culture are quite alien, but the characters are quite human. From a vast well of ignorance, I would opine that the last third is not written by the author of the first two thirds, and the book is complete as the (final) author intended. Anyway, it was a wonderful trip."
4,Walk through a virtual Japanese garden,"Far more qualified minds than mine have commented on Tyler's translation and how it compares to earlier versions. I'll leave those questions to them and simply observe that this is a masterful novel.At its heart it's not much more than an extended character study. However, its modernity and the freshness of its emotion never fail to amaze me. It's astounding to think that such a work was written one thousand years ago.Tyler's introduction does a concise job introducing the reader to the conventions of medieval Japanese love poetry -- no small feat, considering the subtlety and complexity of the art. Tyler also provides important information about character names that I don't remember (perhaps erroneously) from other editions. Ultimately _Genji_ shouldn't be read for a fast-moving plot, but for the grace of its setting and the elegance of its characters."
4,TOO EXPENSIVE FROM THIS SELLER,"I've been buying this product for a couple years.. I didn't know it was offered in such a SMALL container... So when I ordered them, I expected a container TWICE the size...Bottom Line: TOO EXPENSIVE FROM THIS SELLER"
2,Laudate Music of Taize,I was very disappointed to receive only about half the songs that were on the cassette on the CD.There are so many beautiful songs on the second side of the cassette that should have been put on the CD! I feel as if I got half the project. I wish I had known the CD would not be complete!
5,Olivier's politically incorrect masterpiece,"True, you have to get past the blackface make-up, the bright red lips, the false eyelashes; but once that surface is accepted, a great performance is there to be appreciated. Olivier is the blackest Othello I've ever seen, the most 'African', in his movements, the wilds of his emotion, the warrior-like curses and threats as he beats his chest and curses his fate. Many thought it was a ham acting, excruciatingly over the top; for me it was a courageous, dangerous performance, walking the line between terror and pity throughout. His voice is astonishing and his delivery unique and musical and frightening and tender. I thought it was his bravest, and greatest, performance. I'm glad it was recorded as a filmed play and not 'opened up' as a movie, which would have diluted the intensity of the performance. Highly recommended, with the above caveats about the makeup."
5,othello,excellent adaptation of shakespeare's othello. olivier is excellent in the title role as is frank finley as iago(almost steals the movie from olivier). maggie smith is also excellent.excellent cast
3,Is there such a thing as TOO black?,"Okay, so I had to analyze and compare 4 different film versions of Othello for a post-graduate class & this was one of them. Everyone in the class liked it the least, thought Olivier was ""too black,"" and considered his comments about learning to become the otherness of Othello by watching/observing monkeys quite offensive. Olivier plays Othello without any real heart and I didn't care too much about his character. Though this is a complete and about as unabridged film version as you can get, which mimics the appearance of a stage presentation, I didn't even enjoy Iago (my favorite character). For some reason, they all take a backseat to ""the great"" Olivier. Seriously, look at the cover. ""The greatest Othello ever by the Greatest Actor of our time""??? Enough, already!"
2,I'm unconvinced by this one,"This performance has gathered a great deal of critical praise, but it didn't work for me. Part of the problem is that it is essentially a taped stage production. Not that this is always a failing, but in this case it seemed to make Shakespeare's most driven play far too static. Also, there was too much ""acting"" going on. Especially from Olivier -- he was so busy trying to be ""black"" with the eye rolling, exaggerated vocalisms and gestures that I couldn't believe a word he said. His Othello is a caricature. This production has far fewer cuts than the more recent one with Fishburne, if that is a concern. What I would like to see would be the taped stage production with Willard White and Ian McKlellan set in the mid-19th century."
4,Olivier's Moor,"The staging is a bit clunky and atmospherics tend towards a cartoon but the actors are superb. Warning: Olivier veers a bit too close to parodying a minstrel show at times, but his choices are startling for an actor of his training."
5,Brilliant performance!,"Yes, Olivier's performance may be politically incorrect. Rife with stereotypic gestations and histionics, the portrayal was controversal even when it was performed in 1965. Yes, the performance is over-the-top. But once you get past the PC issues I challenge anyone to not be riveted by Olivier's performance. He is simply spell-binding. Once take in your eyes will be glued to the screen and the three hours of this film will have seemed like ten minutes. It is Sir Larry's best screen performance."
5,A Shame,"It is a shame that people like C. Hopkins""the poetess"" can`t enjoy a movie like this.This is one of the greatest performances by possibly the greatest actor(certainly the greatest Shakespearian actor)of the 20th century.Don`t watch the Laurence Fishburne version,it is lame in comparison."
4,A very sexy and entertaining book.,"Marilyn Grall's TAMING THE LION is a very sexy story of a forced marriage between two passionate and strong people. Lionel is the warrior who is order to marry by his lord. Alexandra is the lady. She is young, beautiful, and running wild. In the style of Virginia Henley and Thea Devine, TAMMING THE LION tells the story of a marriage duty, that turns into a passionate marriage of love."
3,Milli Vanillied ?,"If you already owh OPTICAL RACE and LILY, you don't need this one - in fact, this ""live"" album from 1990 borrows so exactly from the aforementioned studio releases you'll never know the difference; EAST sounds to me like a cheat: exact replays of the studio tracks with a few applause mixovers to cover their tracks, so to speak.There are a few pieces with new names, but there's nothing new musically. Worst of all is track 12, ""wall street"" - so plinky-plinky lame it's embarassing - what happened to this once great group? To the man who studied with Dali? To the ones who carved great paths?Maybe I should check out INFERNO again...And if you don't own them already, this jaded reviewer recommends you buy at least the BEST of TD, starting with:1. POLAND2. ENCORE3. LOGOS4. FORCE MAJEURE5. RICOCHET6. STRATOSFEAR[/end guilt-laden plug for old favorite group]"
1,Piece of crap,Bought this (GRIP was the seller). Neat idea bad execution. FIlled it and lit worked fine but did not go out when you let go of the trigger! Even if you blew the flame out (and it barely took a breath to do so) you could hear and smell the gas still flowing. Wait 5 minutes and it's out of gas; pretty dangerous!!!! Refilled it and wouldn't light so I used a match and barely got a hint of a flame. Tried again and same thing a flame the size of a match head which had trouble staying lit and very occasionally would flare to a jet. After 6 times getting this result nothing happens. Gas will not flow.
1,worked for about 15 minutes.,"It worked for the fist fill. Although i had to try 15-20 times to light it each time. After i refilled it, it hasn't worked since. It will not light, although the butane keeps flowing if you do not remove the torch end. Also like other reviews, it stays lit for awhile once you let go of the trigger. Poor quality. I will just buy another propane tank."
1,cannot get it to work with any lighter,"I cannot get this thing to work with any lighter. Barely a puff of fire comes out after trying to ignite like 20 times, which immediately goes out again in less than a second.I've tried adjusting the flame up and down, different brand lighters, and sticking a shim in the bottom in case the lighter was maybe just a poor fit. DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.I purchased this at Autozone, and came here to see if other people who bought this product had the same results as I did. Apparently so."
1,never got it to work,"Couldn't get it to work out the box. Wouldn't work with lighter that came with it or a or regular lighter. I had one that looks the same, that I used for several years that worked great. It's a great idea, and I got a lot of use from the one that I lost. Maybe I just got a dud."
2,Bad Baby Ben DeLuxe,Not the quality you would think of in a Baby Ben DeLuxe. The alarm has not worked from day 1 - appears to be defective workmanship and poor quality material. Was very disappointed. Would not recommend this product
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"Do not buy this item. This Olympic bar pad does not wrap all away around the bar. It does not fit around my Smith Machine bar, my Olympic Bar or even an old generic Olympic Bar I have. It has Velcro that attaches to each other but comes 1 inch short from attaching to each other. I gave it 2 stars because it looks nice but does not function as advertise. I wasted my money so you shouldn't."
2,A two minute read.,Just borrow someone else or look for it at the local library. It is a two minute read with information that wasn't very useful. Internet searches on the subject can provide more insightful information.
5,Essential,"This was my first belly dance tape. I practiced to her calming, clear instruction. When I entered a class, I found far more experienced dancers than I could not do the slow moves she presents so well here. They create limberness in muscle groups that other exercise forms do not address. These are the sensuous moves that are signature to belly dance."
2,"Ahhh, I remember...","...how annoying I found Dolphina and her video. And now that I've sampled other DVD instruction by professional dancers, I can see I was correct in thinking she was all about trying to look sultry and alluring and not so much about teaching the dance. Granted, back then I couldn't make it through the arms section, but that's because they're my weakest area and she did them to death.My experience with this video made me check reviews before making a purchase because I didn't want to make the same mistake twice. And I didn't. If you're interested in belly dance taught methodically and well, I would suggest looking into New York World Dance's DVDs and videos. One of the DVDs I own, ""Love Potion,"" includes an instructional section, a practice flow, the workout dance using the moves learned before, and an extra choreographed dance at the end. With the workout and practice flow, that's 90 minutes."
4,very pleasantly surprised,"I read some of the other reviews on this dvd, and was expecting ... maybe a dud ... but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't find Dolphina's references to religion, chakras, or any of the other less-than-commercial ideologies to be detrimental - more her personal view of the inner workings of the dance. I enjoyed it, and found it to be well planned and beautifully presented. Some of the production values - sound, and camera angles, could have been better... (sometimes you can't see her feet, for a move, sometimes the crashing ocean makes her words difficult to hear), but overall I found it to be an excellent value, an enjoyable session, and probably a lot more akin to the dances of our ancient mothers, in character, than some of the Raqs Sharqi instructionals structured in discipline like a modern ballet class.Teru"
5,Beautiful !!!,"I ordered this item on Saturday night and received it on the following Tuesday !!! It fits really great ! and it's very comfortable. Can wear for dress or casual. I love it !! I highly recommend it. This is my first pair of Aerosole boots and I will purchase again. Thanks, Amazon."
5,"Finally, a convenient source for these batteries!","I've owned my Panasonic 2.4v screwdriver for about ten years, albeit unused for the past 5 or so due to lack of fresh NiCd batteries. Anyway, the EY503B was the best lightweight cordless screwdriver you could buy back around 1991, two speed with torque clutch. I used it professionally daily back then and it's versatility and performance always made my job easier. I recently bought fresh batteries and look forward to putting it back into my tool bag."
3,One size fits all.,"Most roll around shop bases are designed to fit one particular brand of equipment. I have some home built shop stands that I wanted to move around. This rolling base allowed me to fit my customized stands.It took me a couple of tries to get the base to balance correctly. There are some general guidelines in the instructions, however I had to try a couple configurations so my tool would stay level and did not want to tip over when the wheels are engaged.If you have a odd or customized tool stand, this is a good choice for the price. If you have a brand that the manufacture sells their own roll around base, then you might want to go with that model."
3,could be a little better,"I have three mobile bases, two from HTC. This is a smaller model and for my situation needs larger wheels. I also prefer the step on arrangement to raise and lower wheels on the HTC 2000"
1,Never got off the ground!,"I recently bought several heavy pieces of shop equipment, a 16"" planer and a 6"" jointer. I bought the HTC1000 mobile base for the heavier planer and one of the other brands of universal bases (you get the wheels and corners, but have to add lengths of hardwood)for the jointer. The HTC came with missing parts as well as a disjointed mixture of metric and non-metric bolts and nuts. In the end, because of their poor quality control, I wasted much time, it cost me twice as much as I paid for it and I have an inferior base. I am very disgusted."
5,Good product,"I have two of these, one for a heavy table saw the other for a moderate weight radial arm saw. They both work very well. They are pretty stable when moving equipment."
2,wouldn't buy another,i have this base - and i have the delta/rockler base. i wouldn't buy this one again. My beef - that it's not really foot friendly.1. it's tough to lift or lower with your feet.2. when the base is in the lifted position the handles stick out far to either side - i now have at least two pairs of boots with gouges through the leather because of it. A beater pair of shoes - ok - but sometimes i'm just cutting through the shop or have only a couple minutes of work to do and don't want to change...The rockler model is great. i didn't get another because i didn't want to bother making the oak rails. should have sucked it up and put the hour of effort in.
3,Decent mobile base,"The HTC1000 mobile base kit I got was missing parts and the instruction manual. I had to get on the HTC website to figure out what parts I was missing. Their CS was pretty good and received the parts within a week.The base itself is OK. The wheels don't retract as much as other mobile bases so if the caster is not in the right position, the base will still roll even if the levers are disengaged. There are way better products out there, however the HTC1000 does do what it says it does."
5,Mr.,"This universal mobile base is a real piece of work. It goes together easily and is a simple but functional design. Since it is a ""universal"" base, holes must be drilled to make it fit most equipment.I mounted a Ridgid band saw on this base and I chose to drill new holes where the legs were bolted to the base. This required only 4 new holes. To adjust the side rails would have required more holes.The only down side to this base is that user must have access to a drill press for the holes. The metal used is substantial.I intend to purchase 2 more to use on a drill press and table saw."
3,Mobile base,"I bought this for a very old, heavy floor model drill press. It's tippy. It would help if the casters came up further and the center of gravity was a hair lower. For my machine this item is barely adequate."
4,htc 1000 mobile base,The mobile base is very easy to put together.With a few modifications I had the base working very well in only about 15 minutes.I had problems with being able to pull the base.Pushing was easy. I installed a few washers on the swivel wheels and every thing was great.I think it is a very good product
3,How pleased I am with the Mobile Bases,My husband Robert has purchased 4 of these bases from Amazon. He thinks the base is of great quality and are as good as those bases that cost much more in other stores. He is very pleased with these bases and would recommend them to anyone.
5,AWESOME!!,"My two year old son LOVES this cd. He dances to the entire album - in one session, and begs for us to play it. The music is such that I don't mind playing it regularly, and the lyrics are fun. Our favorites are number 4 and 8. My two year old even sings to them.Definately worth the money!"
4,Silly Songs for Kids,"We got this for my daughter's 5th (pirate) birthday party but it arrived too late for it. The songs are quite fun though and we just listen to it in the car, etc. The melodies vary (50s, ballads, etc.) with pirate lyrics - all very innocent. Worth it for those who love pirates and all things pirate!"
4,Fun but not as good as the Disney one,"This album is fun and has a lot of catchy tunes. I purchased it for my son's 6th birthday and it was a hit. However, some of the songs are not as fun as the songs on the Disney pirate album and therefore only rates 4 stars. It is a good, low cost set of pirate songs for a pirate party."
5,Kid friendly music the whole family will enjoy!,"This is one of the best kids cd's we have! If you have a youngster that is into pirates, buy this cd and the whole family will be singing and laughing. There are narrative transitions that tie the whole album together from the pirate ship setting sail to when they head home. Many songs are similar to artists adults know such as Beach Boys and 50's doo-op style. Even better, this age group 2 to 6 or so wants to listen to something over and over to make it their own (age appropriate according to our kid's teachers)--this music is easy to listen to over and over. We are all singing along in the car and trying to dance the pegleg tango at home. My favorite song is about the sea monster; they wisely make it almost a lullaby so as not to scare the kids.Great cd, I can't say enough."
4,Entertainment Weekly Review (June 2005),"PEGLEG TANGO""As Johnny Depp proved, pirates and scurvy never lose their appeal. On this merrily wacky album, salty-dog sing-alongs that conjure the Monkees, Elvis Presley, and the Beach Boys are linked by buccaneer skits that wink and nod at Spike Jones and Monty Python. Here's a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum for a disc that kids will memorize down to the last aargh."" - Entertainment Weekly (June 2005)"
2,Marriage and Family,"The textbook itself was in great condition, but it took FOREVER to get. I started online classes three weeks after I order them and didn't get my book until two weeks AFTER my classes started."
4,This watch works for me.,I often wake in the night and the light is helpful to ascertain the time without turning on the light. I would give it five stars for the price. I will upgrade the stars if the batteries hold out for the next few months.
1,Very disappointed,The first watch received was defective and did not run although the battery was good. A replacement watch had the same problem and was returned for a refund. The supplier should check the watches before shipment to be sure they are functional.
3,Handy Reference,"This is a handy reference. By itself it seems a little awkward to use, but if used in conjunction with a spoken audio course (like the Pimsleur Language Program) it is very useful, as much of Tagalog must be heard so you can pronounce words correctly. I have found that in Tagalog two words that seems the same pronounced slightly different have wildly different meanings. Best to know how to pronounce the words before you open you mouth, else risk being incredibly rude and insulting."
3,great for starters,It is a good starter phrase book. It was a gift for my son that would like to travel to the Philippines.
4,Review for Tagalog Essential Phrasebook,"The product arrived in better shape and ahead of time as anticipated.It is not helpful to me only because my plans have changed.It is exactly what would be needed for someone travelling to the Philippines, especially for the first time.The only recommendation that I could make, would be in the area of pronunciation, as there are alot of Tagalog words that use letter combinations that are foreign to westerners (such as ng).WT"
5,Read & Be Blessed!,Wendy Alec has been given the secrets of heaven directly from the Lord. This book is anointed and will explain why Satan fell. God has blessed us with a visit to eternity written through His servant Wendy Alec. Buy this book for all mature Christians & those who have an open heaven before God. You will be blessed!
2,Too Flowery,I am tired of this book. Every sentence is full of so many words that are descriptive that it is wearing me out. Whoever told this author to add so many words that are not necessary told her wrong. It just makes for a frustrating read. Keep it simple. Aggravating when it could have been a great book.
4,Very Good Book,"Im not much for fiction, but this book was very good. It caused me to think about the events in the Bible in a more ""real"" way. The authors make the Angels and their experiences more humane, if such a thing is possible. I could empathize with Lucifer's internal dilemma when confronted with the creation of man. Great, great, visual imagery....at least in my opinion. Its a solid novel."
1,Very Poorly Written,"I have read and enjoyed some Christian fiction, and I have particularly enjoyed Peretti's This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness, even though I am not an evangelical Christian. I believe that understanding the spiritual world and struggles behind the world we see is very important, and I thought perhaps this book would have some interesting things to say about the fall of that great being who was a pinnacle of creation and who has made himself so twisted. So I did want to enjoy this book, and I am sympathetic to its theme! But I agree with all the reviewers who gave this one star. It was so poorly written I could not even finish it. I no longer have the book to refer to to give a more detailed and helpful review; I didn't even want it taking up space on my bookshelf! The Christian message is not well-served by this book, in my opinion."
5,A great inspirational read,It depicts the rise of the beast in a very descriptive manner. It is suspenseful and full of twists and turns.
4,Story that you cannot find anywhere else.,"I love Wendy Alec's novels. That being said, Wendy Alec is not a very good fiction novel author. Her use of rather strange diction and word choices often leave new readers very confused. She is also overly repetitive in her descriptions. For example, she describes the beautiful scenes of heaven with very unique (and sometimes weird) adjectives, and then proceeds to use the same words to describe the same scenery a few chapters down. Her writing is clearly not very polished.That being said, this story is a story that cannot be found elsewhere. It is mind boggling and revelating. For those readers that are familiar with the biblical allegories, these books will be full of great surprises. For those readers that are reading it as a simple fiction novel, it should still be fun and engaging. I would strongly recommend these books to everyone, but not without a warning of possible discomfort at the style of her writing."
3,Imagery,"I do like the book so far! I don't like that at times it feels as though I am reading a thesaurus. Some words feel a bit out of my league. The imagery is fantastic, the author does a wonderful job describing the colors, details, the features...very much a heavenly scene."
1,This book is HORRIBLE!!!!,"I once thought that the novels written by D. Brian Shafer were bad... until I read this one. Angels helping God in Creation, God's DNA, computers in Heaven, angels that are portrayed more as humans than angels, AND GABRIEL BEING TEMPTED TO FALL WITH LUCIFER! The horrible list goes on.Granted very little about this subject has been talked about in Scripture, but too many creative liberties were taken to bastardize one of the most important pieces of Christian mythology. The only thing I can applaud the effort for is the imagination than went into some of the settings toward the end of the book. But creative use for settings are useless without strong characters and a well written plot.I hope that someone will someday successfully take off from what Milton did good with and do a better job than Wendy Alec or D. Brian Shafer has.This book is HORRIBLE!!!!!Worst version ever!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,"I couldn't put this book down. The imagery was awesome, it was well written to say the least and packed with revelation. It also carries a very high annointing! I highly recommend this book!"
2,Confused,"Alec is unable to display spiritual worlds. Lucifer is in rebellion at the idea of a material yet Heaven is described by Alec as being very much a material realm (they eat, sleep, draw blood from one another, have computers and electronic equipment!!!).Furthermore, it seems silly and somewhat blasphemous for an evangelical Christian like Alec to even float the idea that God needs the help of billions and billions of sapphire armored, platinum braided, emerald tinged angels (this is the way Alec writes) to assist in creating the universe.I was very disappointed by this book."
4,"Great story with technical flaws. Still, the story counts!","Being a writer/filmmaker I have studied and worked in these two professions for quite a while (the writing arena is the one I've ""lived in"" longest). I have read countless books in my lifetime. I have written books, scripts and short stories of my own. This book is a classic case of a writer who has fallen in love with scenic descriptions. It is also a classic case of the fondness of adjectives. Poor writing makes the depths of my soul groan- however, if a book has a very good or great story, I will continue with it. Because in the end, STORY is what makes the world go 'round.How do you know if this book is something you would enjoy?Simple. Can you push aside some technical flaws in the writing and read a building, interesting story? If you can't then this book is not for you. If so, give it a go! The writing does get better as the series goes along. :)"
2,Mind-numbingly boreing!,"This is exactly why i don't read fiction. This book portrays itself as facts but the author spends way too much time on details. i don't really need 3 paragraphs describing exatly what a particular gate looked like. I'm not sure how this book got past an editor, but obviously it did. Alot of this book is highly inacurate according to the Bible and the Satanic bible about The Fall. It does have it good points and will draw you in, only to completely bore you minutes later."
1,Blasphemous Book,I will not recommend any one to read this book. This book has no basis in the bible. Some of the things mentioned can be derieved from the bible but majority of the book is written on human basis and can no where be found in the bible. I will highly ask people not to waste there money on this book.
1,Romanticized drivel,"With apologies to those who are drawn to the pseudo-religious themes, ""Fall of Lucifer"" is ""Paradise Lost"" dumbed down to the shallowness of a Harlequin novel, complete with three adjectives for every noun. Symbolism, metaphor and mythos are visible only in those empty spaces where they died stillborn. Contrary to the jacket promo, the writing is far short of epic; it might qualify as fantasy only as it chronicles the writer's fantasies. I personally was grieved to see a concept so full of potential wasted on such trash."
3,Interesting,"I thought this book was interesting. However, I feel like the author gave to much credit to the angels for creating man. Also, I don't think God needs help on figuring out how to build the Ark. This was a good work of fiction, and thats what it was, fiction. I also feel the author was trying to hard to be decriptive, because it was very distracting. The story didn't flow at parts because I was trying to hard to read. Overall, I think people will enjoy this book, but don't take it as truth."
2,Horrible Dialogue,"The book has an interesting premise, almost like a Shakespearean epic of the turmoil between three princes, but gosh the dialogue is so badly written it's hard to hack your way along after a while.. just tiresome. I'm sorry but it's the truth!"
5,Enjoyable reading,"While this is a result of the author's imagination, it may make you think of your theology and the angelic/demonic group. I do not totally agree with the author, but is a quick and interesting read. Well worth your time"
1,What Is She Going on About?,"This could have been a great story! Instead Alec rather rip off Sword and Sorcery, Dungeons and Dragons (both of which she probably so piously disapproves).She spends most of the book describing the walls full of diamonds and emeralds, describing the holgrams in the computer rooms of heaven! What is all that?"
2,A future best selling writer.,"I give this book two stars for the subject matter. Ever thing else was to garish from the first page to the last. Who needs to know the name of ever gemstone in this heaven Mrs. Alec created. Beyond the many flaws, the story did bring up some interesting points like the creation of Adam and the strange alien worlds Lucifer briefly mention. One thing that bother me was when Michael was throw in prison to be torutue for what reason? to prove his loyatly this isn't explictly explained by Mrs. Alec. One more thought, the war in heaven lasted only about twenty pages, this was suppose to be the greast battle in the casmos and little detail was given. The war wasn't even a war simply reduced to a battle where Michael and Lucifer barely exhange sword swings. I hope one who is more adapt at writing will come along and produce a sound discriptive novel about this War in Heaven."
2,Not inspired,"I understand that this was fiction, but some readers have expressed the view that the author was inspired and wrote under the influence of God. If that were true then surely it would have been more factually correct? Small things bothered me, such as Gabriel struggling with the temptation to follow Lucifer, the angels having to sleep at night (they don't have earthly bodies), Eve being blonde and also the daughters of men being blonde, when most likely they would have been darker skinned.I could take what I liked and spit out the rest, but I fear for new Christians or gullible ones thinking this book was inspired by God and therefore factual."
5,AMAZING... THOUGHT PROVOKING!!!,"WHAT AN AMAZING READ!!! Even though this is a work of fiction, it is based upon scripture and as such it will be an eye opener for those of us who are believers! If you ever needed an answer to, ""why does God love me""... ""why does God want fellowship with me""... well give this book a try!! If you even wondered why there is such evil and destruction and chaos in the universe... this book will give you some food for thought!Once I got into it, I could not put it down!! Wendy Alec is an amazing writer... such insights could only come from a very close, personal relationship with her Creator!!!! I highly recommend this book!!C.Krug"
3,Just a word of caution...,"While I find this a pretty good book, and appreciate the approach the author takes, I really was a bit unnerved by the constant quoting of scripture and references to Jesus. If you do not belive in Jesus, or sin or heaven/hell and...I was really put off by suggesting that one reason your button pusher does what he does may be due, in part, to demonic forces.I wish that I had known the strong Christian slant of this book before I purchased it. I am not Christian, and I am not comfortable with the constant bible thumping. But there are some sound ideas and suggestions.I had to...as the saying goes, ""Take what I want and leave the rest."" Some might not be a great match for this book base on what I found."
5,super duster-blender,"These little Camel hair brushes are perfect for dusting off your pencil drawing as you proceed, of eraser particles and grahite residue. It also functions as a blender of graphite when you want to soften the tone or contrast of a drawing. I have no opinion of it's value in painting."
3,It failed expectations,"They are OK. I use the,m but I had to go and get new ones because these did not do the job right."
4,Nice novel (that the movie was based off of)....,"...but the movie is better. That said, this is an enjoyable read and the story does indeed come to life. It is just very hard to compete with Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, and Renee Russo!Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
4,just like the new staff one.,It's just like the new staff one. That is all I can say I can say no more. And why should I waste my breath and your time?
3,it's ok,"I am kind of torn on this review, it is a cute game. You are definately paying for the Pony brand, the graphics are no where near a pc game, and the sound (words) can sometimes be tough to understand. My daughter is 4 and she has played it a few times, but the game is limited as to what you can do and when. so i'm giving it an ok review. my daughter was thrilled and we can take it to family and friends for entertainment, but a little pricey for what you get."
5,Good Buy!,"I bought this for scanning mostly pictures, just personal use. I think it's worth the price I paid, Because it scans the pics fast, and its so simple to figure out how to use it. I'd recommend it!"
1,Disappointed,"No instruction manual, a couple of paragraphs and I guess you are supposed to know how to use it. Help online answers questions that aren't understandable, if you could understand them you wouldn't ask the questions. No explanation of how to add a scan to a file or to email it. It's not intuative so I guess you need training(!) to operate it. I'd send it back and order another model but I'm afraid I'd get the same results. I checked at a local computer repair and he agreed figuring it out is not for the novice. Canon, be ashamed.......I guess I'll need training that cost more than your product....."
3,Another good Canon product,I have not yet used my new scanner enough to rate it but I expect it to perform up to Canon's high standards.
3,Good enough for a person who doesn't expect too much.,"I bought this scanner just because one needs to have a scanner to place some documents and non-digital pictures to computer from time to time.Luckily for me, I use it not so often. It is very, very slow. Besides, Photo Studio software is slow and primitive. Now I have digital camera and can see the difference between its software and that one enclosed with this scanner.However, you really need to have a scanner, and, if you are not too demanding, buy this scanner and use it!Now, after one year,I can add that I like this thing more and more.It is reliable and serves me every time I need it."
1,Good DOCUMENT scanner but nothing else!!!,"I was bought this scanner 2 months ago because of some GREAT comments of this site. But believe me this scanner is ONLY FOR B/W DOCUMENTS or some simple color pictures. Nothing else. The color scanning is terrible. All picturies are in RED, and deep shadows details are missing. Don't buy it for quality color scanning."
4,Great USB Scanner,"I'm very happy with this product. I needed a scanner that was compact, easy to travel with and (most importantly) USB powered. It's not the fastest scanner (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) but what can you expect for something this small without a separate power supply."
5,Awesome Product,"I absolutely love this little scanner. I was looking for a scanner that was seperate from a printer and a copier and I found a great one. Those combo machines are crap. I've bought two of those over the past few year and both have had one of the components crap out. So I decided to buy a separate scanner and this little one is a beaute. It doesn't take up much space but it does an awesome scan of pictures, documents and anything else you could think of. Also the best thing I like about it is that is automatically crops pictures--this feature is great. Also it actually is compatible with VISTA which is surprising because nothing I look at these days seems to be, even though Microsoft swears that it is. (You can tell what I think about VISTA.) I am very satisfied with this product. I suggest it to anyone looking for a little scanner to call their own."
1,Canon LIDE 25 is a pig,"15 minutes to warm up once the USB cable is plugged in, and 5 minutes to scan a page, with mediocre scan results. You could do better if you copy the original with a crayon.This is my third scanner, and my first USB. Admittedly, I bought it for portability, because it would fit in a laptop case; thus, I knew it was not the same high-end scanner I was used to. But it failed abysmally to meet my intentionally reduced expectations.Flee! Flee!"
4,Got the job done,"I bought this scanner to scan family photos. It got the job done, but as others have mentioned the scanning speed is very slow and noisey.I didn't have any problems hooking up the scanner or installing the software.I scanned about 40 photos, most all at 600 DPI. (The higher the DPI the higher the quality, but also the longer it takes to scan.) I found that it was essential to preview each scan (to adjust the scan area, do any tweaking, etc.), which really added to the scan time.If I were to have more photos to scan than I did, I would look for something faster. But for what I needed and for the price, this is a great scanner.I did have some trouble scanning documents in that many were illegible when scanned. But I didn't bother to look at the documentation for info or tips.I only used the scan feature. However, the scanner I purchased also has a copy and fax feature."
4,Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 Scanner,"I am a graphic designer who works from home occasionally. My old Epson all-in-one printers kept drying up and I decided to switch to just the scanner. I don't need it for hi-res, color perfect work, just an occasional scan of my sketches or reference material. All this can be done perfectly on this extremely compact and elegant little scanner. Let me remind you, it has only one cable! It's a USB cable that you plug into your computer, load the driver (I don't need the rest of color software as I am using Photoshop) and it's ready. So far I've used for about a month and, as expected, it works as promised. The only comment I'd like to make is the noise it makes while scanning. It's not deafening, just surprisingly audible for something this small and light.I am using it connected to my Mac running OS 10.5. Enjoy it!"
4,good for what i need now,"Good scanner. I just needed better quality images for website; better than just digital photos. I have to work on them in photoshop, but if you have photoshop it's a good scanner for the money."
2,Macintosh users beware,"I purchased the model several years ago. I'd been quite happy with it, it worked on my PCs or my Macintoshs. The problem now is Canon has not kept up with the drivers on the Macintosh and since I don't use PCs anymore this unit is dead weight. Searching the Internet for alternate drivers shows me many other people have the same issue with driver software and there seems to be no alternatives. It is not USB 2.0 compatible BTW. It was not designed to be."
1,Tried 2 Units - Both Left Streaks,"I wanted to love this product - USB powered, inexpensive, thin. But in some trial scans of pictures both big and small, there seemed to be a streak running down the middle of the scanned image. It could be a result of a reflection off the scan assembly drive shaft, as it seems to be in that location. However, knowing what it is doesn't make it better or go away. Tried two units - both had streaks and both are now returned."
5,Easy for a tech dummy like me.,"Received the Canon printer promptly from Amazon; Was so surprised on how fast it was processed and shipped. Opened it with glee and wild abandon. It had a quick start sheet and no user manual which was a good thing, I hate novels. Set up was a breeze. My first scan was completed 5 minutes after installing the software. I was overjoyed, I momentarily passed out. I then went to my photo albums and created scans of my cherished pics of yesterday. I did about 25 'quick and dirty' scans which were very very nice for my tastes. I will tinker around with the enclosed software in the future. I love all Canon products and so glad I added this scanner to my Canon collection comprising of digital cameras; printers; and now this baby."
3,"So far, so good","Hey, I got this just yesterday. I haven't played with it too much so this may need to be updated after I've had a real crack at it. But while I'm here, it works okay for me.The odd thing is that it doesn't have a power cord because it runs directly off your usb computer connection. It made me nuts looking for the power cord-but then me, the brainiac, decided to read the directions and it explained it right on there.It makes a funny noise while running but nothing major. Just surprised me a little. It doesn't strike me as a heavy duty scanner. It's more for people like me who just use it once in awhile for uploading photos onto your computer. It's really thin. I was surprised at how thin it was.Anyway, so far so good.But like I said, I don't think it would be good for someone who needs a heavy duty user scanner."
3,The chepest scanner!,"The scanner work as it promise, it's a little cheap made, but works. It's a little slow, if you usu it ocasionally like me thm is ok, but if you use it a lot buy a better one."
2,This Died after 4 uses!,"The software was a pain, and now it's dead after just 4 times i used it. HP scanner is next for me, Canon made a hunk of trash."
1,Does not work with Windows Vista (64),"I would give this piece of crap 0 stars if there was such an option. None of Cannon's own drivers work. I have downloaded, installed and uninstalled the latest drivers and toolbox software several times, yet nothing works. I can't even scan a gray scale file let alone a PDF.One of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon."
3,"Convenient, but poor scans","I love the fact that the scanner is powered by USB only, and that I can store it on a bookshelf among my books. Hard to beat the price, too. The image quality, however, is the worst I have ever seen from a scanner. It's possible that my unit has something wrong with it. I will live with the poor quality of the image, since I only use it for document records, but forget about trying to do anything with quality color images."
5,great scanner,"This is a great all purpose scanner. Power supply through USB - so no additional cabling etc.Great image quality. I have been using it since 2005 - flawless.Quite compact - so one can carry it in a briefcase, if necessary.And - works with a Mac quite seamlessly.Even works with SANE (linux, unix).Only thing that I miss is the ADF. But of course, that will significantly reduce the portability of the scanner."
4,"Nice little scanner, not for big jobs","This scanner is exactly what you get when you pay $50 for a scanner. It's great for a few copies in a sitting, but not made for large quantities of scans. If thats what you need, then look at more expensive models. I bought this scanner for the sole purpose as an addition to my home PC to scan articles or the odd business document. The quality is good and you can barely tell the difference between the original and copy on 300dpi. The machine is loud and slow, but it gets the small jobs done. Well worth the $50 I spent on it."
4,Canon CanoScan LiDE Scanner,"Easy to use right out of the box. Software installation is a ""snap"" and the USB connection is great. Don't understand why Canon is still using a 1.1 USB instead of the much superior 2.0 (So much faster and better). Guess that's how the price is kept low. A USB 2.0 would change the rating to 5 stars.Had no problem with my first scan on the LiDE 25; results were as you would expect from a unit with these specs."
2,Does not work with Apple OS 10.5.2 Leopard!,"This scanner works with my company furnished laptop under XP Pro service pack 2. It does not work with my Mac-mini under OS X 10.5.2 which is why I bought it. When I go to the Canon website it gives me the Mac download for OS 10.5.2 but it fails to install. When I called Canon Tech Support they said it was a Apple problem and that I had to become a ""root"" user to install it! That also did not work. They then said it was Apple's operating systems fault!!The problem is the Twain driver is not recognized by the Mac OS. I had never had any problems with other thirdparty software installing. I do know Canon did not write this for Apple's Universal binary which OS X likes and uses. I cannot recommend this to Apple users until Canon fixes this Twain driver issue."
1,Twain error,"Unfortunately, this scanner did not work. I got a continual error message of ""twain error"", which Canon support could not fix. Therefore, I'm out my $50. All I was shooting for was to scan in some old family pictures; then I wouldn't even need it any more. Everything else on my computer always works perfectly. I'll find another way."
4,"great scanner, especially for the price","I bought this scanner to scan in about 150 old black and white family photos, and they all came out very nicely. I scanned only a handful of color pictures, and they were fine as well.Some experiences I had using the scanner:- smaller pictures end up getting a better final resolution- the quality is great for pictures, but only average for text; for example newspaper articles don't scan well enough to allow you to read smaller text- I was able to scan aout 30 pictures in an hour- scanning multiple photos is usually easy: you don't have to crop a big image into the individual photos because the scanning software figures out the picture boundaries. However, occasionally the picture boundary detection stuff messes up and the scanner detects 1 fewer picture than was in the scanner, forcing you to rescanFor some old polaroids, the scanned picture was clearer and brighter than the polaroid. it brought out the picture inan amazing way."
4,Comments about new LIDE 25 Color Image Scanner by a Mac user,"This machine is a marvel, particularly at the price (although I wish I had paid $10 more for the faster version). In the previous version I had used, the software (Photoshop Elements) ran only on Classic, while the scanner would not work if Classic was running! This is seamless. The OCR feature is unbelievable. I first tried it on a poor-quality 50-year old mimeographed page, where the original had been made on a dirty typewriter. There were only a few errors. When higher-quality text is scanned,the character recognition is nearly 100% accurate. It was a surprise OCR was included, let alone that it would run so well. Partly, it was a surprise because the specs are so incomplete."
4,CanoScan Lide25,"This seems to be a great little scanner, especially for the reasonable price. The pictures do not look very clear when I scan them so it is hard to figure out exactly what the printed picture will look like ; however, when I get the picture color right, it prints a very good picture."
5,Scans pretty good!,The person who received this is very happy with it and says it works great. Good product.
4,My review,"I am still learning, but so far so good. It is compact and seems easy enough to work with. Hopefully I will continue to enjoy using it."
3,Not bad for the price,"The Canon CanoScan LiDE 25 is not a bad device for the price. I use it for scanning documents during mortgage signings and it is very clear.Pros: clear image , it is very light weight. I place it into my case next to my laptop without a problem. It is USB powered. Very cool.Cons: it is slow."
3,Decent Scanner but loud,"The Scanner works perfectly fine, it picks up a good deal of details in pictures and works for my purpose, scanning old pictures to put into jpg formats. The one complaint I have is it's pretty loud. While it's actually scanning the photo it makes a good deal of noise, but it still does the job and does it well."
3,okay for the money,What would you expect from a scanner under $100.00 Exactly and that's what you get. It's okay for the money thus far I have just made copies of office work and it works quite well but a bit slow conpaired to the last scanner I owned. The software that comes with it is nice and easy to use. over all I would give it a C+.
3,Pretty good,"This scanner is pretty good considering that I paid less than fifty dollars for it. I don't like the software it came with very much, and I didn't know I was going to have to read a fourty page manual to learn how to use the editing program it comes with either. I also have to hold the lid down while it is scanning to keep light from getting in and ruining the scan because the lock quit working two days after I got it. Besides that, it does take good scans, and it is reasonably fast and relatively quiet. I give it three stars instead of four because of the non-intuitive nature of the software."
4,Quality product for the price,"I have been very happy with the purchase, the scan is a little slower than some but for the price the quality of the print and the software that comes with the scanner is well worth it."
5,good quality,"Canon lide is really good, no matter which model. This one has basic functions, works well with good quality"
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","I initially bought the Canon LiDE 25 in May of 2007 to scan some old pictures for my son's graduation party slide show. It did great and continued to perform well until a couple months ago. I had not even had the scanner for an entire year, and it began giving me an undefined error message--one that said I needed to refer to the manual--the one that DIDN'T come with the scanner. When I looked this error up online, I found that it meant the scanner was somehow locked, which it wasn't. I tried locking and unlocking, disconnecting and reconnecting, all to no avail. I'm hoping this was all a fluke, because I am seriously considering buying the same model to replace it. While it was actually functioning properly, it was a powerhouse for the price."
1,Complete Crap,Waste of money! The load time for a single scan takes approximately 2 minutes. Why? I have no idea. The program interface is similar to the old gateway 1995 system and it has a tendency to crash. Not to mention after the 2 minutes of scanning the image may or may not appear on your desktop. - PLEASE LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE!
5,Best Little Scanner for Me,"I have bought lots of items through Amazon and this one is excellent. At 67 yrs, some easy to use doesn't mean that I can use it. This is trule easy to use. Just love it."
4,Good deal,"The 3 buttons on this scanner are never used as I crop, adjust, etc. before printing, as for the scanner itself working great after one year and is used often, for the price a great deal. Next time (if every) I will upgrade for one without button, Every thing I have is a cannon as I have good luck with them. 4 stars is just about right"
1,Garbage,"When it works it works fine. But after a few scans the thing tries to calibrate itself and usually fails, telling you to follow the instructions in the manual. I couldn't find these alleged instructions anywhere in the manual or Canon's nearly useless website. Sometimes trying to scan again will eventually work, sometimes not. I had to scan a bunch of old pictures for a surprise party but this thing decided to quit on me halfway through the job. Best of luck to Canon if this is the junk they sell."
5,Excellent Diversion!,"I've had this game for about 15 yrs & it's still a fun diversion. Mine says Hasbro, this says Atari but same artwork & I'm sure same game. I play it solitaire-against the computer & have made small chits to keep track of 4 out of the 6 possible ""players""."
1,dissapointment plus garbage equals clue,"This game is garbage and worthless. For children the kill scenes are graphic likely to lead to nightmares, show a side of clue that is trying to appeal to mid 90's teenagers. A more complicating game of clue and not reccomanded for young children, was dissapointed when I recieved it."
3,some adjustment,Looks exactly the same but when you try to install it you need to shave where the holes are because would not fit it was tight.
4,"Easy to install, looks noce","Was fairly easy to install (less than an hour, but I'm a gearhead) and looks good. The directions leave a little bit to be desired though and the rubber seal is hard to get right around the isolation box and seated right."
5,Easy Install,It was an easy install. Throttle response was slightly improved. Double check the hose clamps after a week or so.Tidies up corner of engine compartment too.
3,K&N,"Installs quickly with all necessary parts privided. Only problem is the lack of information associated with the product as it relates to post installation. The very 1st thing is that your engine will stall a couple of times, simply because of the amount of air that is sent through. It will iddle very very very high, until the system runs through its checks. After that the engine light will come on, because of fault #P0113 - Intake Air Temperature Circuit High Input. Now you need to figure out how to regulate the temp going into the engine.Not necessaraly the problem of the seller, but then again a simple note stating some possible "" side effects "" would be welcomed."
5,Stott the Master expositor,"John Stott continues to delight in both his skill with the pen and the clarity of his theological insight--faithful to the reformed doctrines in his exposition of scripture, yet insightful in application. I highly recommend to all preachers as the most accessible exegesis written by the consummate teacher. There is a reason he is the elder statesmen of the evangelical movement."
2,Wasted Potential,"This movie started off very well, with a lot of suspense. In fact, I was interested until the last 30 minutes when the smart characters, as played by Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid, started doing REALLY DUMB things.I mean, If you have just run across your expansive property in the rain and lightning, and you have reached your house and notice your Jeep is on fire in the front yard, do you run inside the house to hide? Hmmm, where's the bad guy? Also, why not spend a little money on security (locks, gates, etc.) to keep the bad guy out? This couple could have easily afforded some security when they got the house for nothing.Juliette Lewis is now definitely type-cast in my mind. Can she only play the white ..., stupid [woman of the night]?... It really did start out well. I only think that the audience ... could have picked a more appropriate ending! ..."
1,Horrible,"This movie should have gone down the ""Devil's Throat."" If you have had the displeasure of seeing this movie then you know what I am talking about. Complete garbage."
3,Mildly entertaining--and STUPID!,"I just watched this movie a few nights ago. What I remember is that throughout the entire movie I kept thinking, the script is horrible! I laughed out loud so many times at some of the lines and the constant poor judgement exercised by the parents (Played by Quaid and Stone)...not to mention the poor acting by Quaid and Stone. Just terrible.My favorite part of the movie was when snakes were discovered in different parts of the house by each of the four members of the family at the very same time and they all freaked out and went running, in hysterics, through the house. It was the funniest scene I think I have ever seen. Snakes aren't aggressive as they are portrayed in this movie! Snakes avoid people! They don't snuggle up in bed with them! (hehe)Highly predictable. Mildly entertaining. Not Scary. Not much of anything really.Rent it before buying it."
1,It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than This...,Juliette Lewis...Sharon Stone...Stephen Dorff..It should have been called COLD CAREER MANOR...especially when they appear in things like this....
1,The horror!!!!,"I'd rather voluntarily bob for french-fries than to watch this uninspired, unoriginal and ""horror-ibly"" predictable ""movie"" ever again!!!! I could vacuum my carpet with this disc!!"
